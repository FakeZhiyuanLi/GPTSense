       I am&nbsp; Livvy, my&nbsp;fiancee has cancer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   We found out in January that Andy has a large tumour inside his brain.&nbsp; An Astrocytoma Glioma say the Neurologists.&nbsp; I really did not want to start out my 2nd blog entry with this.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;actually tried a few alternative begginnnings, but none seemed to work.&nbsp; I would hate for people to think that this cancer defines me... "Oh, &nbsp;it's the cancer blog".&nbsp; But I am going to have faith in my readers to realise that this does not define me.&nbsp;       Andy has had Radiotherapy,&nbsp;the tumour&nbsp;is not growing, but it is not getting smaller either.&nbsp; A waiting game.&nbsp; I'm actually doing quite alright at the moment.&nbsp; I feel that I have the ability to be able to concentrate on other things.&nbsp; Andy on the other hand is up and down..&nbsp; Mostly up when he feels&nbsp;well and mostly down when he feels sick.  Andy is a tall and lovely boy.&nbsp; I'm not sure what height he is but I'm 5'9" and he is a good head bigger than me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you walked past Andy on the street,&nbsp; he would avert his eyes or look so intent on his destination that you would not want to bother him.&nbsp; My boy&nbsp;is noble and kind, but&nbsp;also shy as a sparrow.&nbsp; Andy is from all appearances just like any other man, yet I&nbsp;take great pleasure in the fact that&nbsp;I know him so&nbsp;intimately and therefore to me, he is a strange and wonderful creature.&nbsp; He speaks to me so clearly without having to say a word.&nbsp; Different types of silences, the movement of just a few facial muscles or a&nbsp;slight pause in his step&nbsp;tell me stories of what it feels like to be under his skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I do not want to define myself by the role I play in his life.&nbsp; But by playing this role I am further exploring the intracacies of my own life and body.&nbsp; My limits,&nbsp;my (in)ability to surrender to an inner peace,&nbsp;my&nbsp;need for meaning and fulfillment and the&nbsp;never-ending rolling-on of a&nbsp;both sublime and&nbsp;suffering world.    &nbsp;  "One day you will look in the mirror and greet yourself with elation"&nbsp;

      &nbsp;  I have just set my lovely one off to bed and am sitting down to write this, for what I guess might be useful for a few reasons...   1 - therapy (who needs therapy!? hehehe) &nbsp; 2- creative outlet (very underrated in today's society) 3- the chance to write my name on the concrete slab that is this world.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
