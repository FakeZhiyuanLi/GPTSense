      True, the summer weather has been crap so far, but a Wednesdaynight in Amsterdam.... dont even bother to leave your house... (Am I negative?).
But, I did, first nite of Spiderman II in Tuschinsky movie theatre. For all those who have neva been in this theatre : main room is beyond belief! Art Deco interior, private balconies, a high ornamented ceiling, VIP treatment. About the film: very entertaining and well done...nice suit! Made for all audiences.... I had a good time!
Then, after film drinks in April's, a gaybar in Amsterdam, then after April drinks at Spijker's, a gay bar in Amsterdam, came home felt the urge and had the energy to write some in my blog...
Balcony doors open, ID&T on the radio...  plenty of time, no need to go to bed, typing away peacefully and happily, just wonderful!!!

      I was told to not to make any appointments for Tuesday July 6th. It was a surprise, but bf was so excited himself he wanted to tell me at several occasions what the surprise entailed. Tip: never seem anxious to know, then they will tell.
Ok, I am gay but I love cars, not all cars just the big, luxury and expensive ones. And small sporty two door convertibles... and we were to test drive a SMART roadster. A miniature two door convertible. BF is about 6'2 and I am about 5'10, how on earth is one to get into a roadster? Sticking your head in went ok, but the rest of our fabulous, passion oozing bodies had quite some trouble actually to rest our tight behinds in one of the chairs. Finally we got the hang of it, explained and shown and shown again by the student-like shop boy, at least 6'3 tall. I am telling you, never buy a car one to need to enter as follows (unless you fancy wearing D&G miniskirts with nothing underneath and a big blond wig): open door, show interior you cute hard ass, act like you are in the little boys room for a #2, stick out your behind, lay to rest in chair, keep you legs tight together (I am sure the nerve that picks up that command was ripped out, burned and buried once a person thought he might as well like boys), move bondaged legs into car, do not hit steering wheel, do not put your feet in speedometer, just put them in front of the two pedals. Dutch people and neither do continental Europeans, are not used to driving an automatic gearbox. I once used to have an American car so I know. 
Ignition: not in the usual place. No, like Saab, in between the two chairs (like most roadsters, only passenger is sitting next to you, as it should be), you are to ignite the 1.1 litre engine. 1.1??!!! The trolley only weighs 25kg, so plenty of horse powers.

To my surprise it is wonderful on the road, fast, great at traffic lights turning green (your lane) and parking!!! During your drive, remove top & get tan, keep eyes on the road/on the road and a bit on the person next to you (if remotely handsome) and if not, on the road, on traffic light if red and on the cute guy standing next to you (ignore any female passengers).

First stop the second hand Rolls Royce & Bentley dealer near Amsterdam. I have always loved those cars for their ugliness, length and fine luxury. My favourite models where on sale (Silver Cloud III MPW coupe, Silver Shadows I &II, and a wonderful two door Corniche II in burgundy). And the latter only costs 35.000 euro! Don't even wrap it. That is only 5.000 euro more than a vehicle that cannot even be called a car.....
Some day I will have one, watch me.

OK, then : beach, lunch, looked at wonderful new building projects, back to Amsterdam, picked new colour to do the study, in the interior and design mall, an early dinner in IJburg chez Blok 4 (ran into someone I used to know ;-), can one never be incognito?), theatre (... a standing ovation for a guy that lipsings and takes off paper clothing..??!!), back to beach for last round).

It has been fun driving the SMART roadster, turning heads while a Porsche convertible was driving in front of us, but..... where does one put the other boyfriends?

      Today I was reborn. My friend S. is a mac.freak and kept on nagging me about me getting a new computer. Finally my Toshiba exchanged this world for tamagotchi-heaven, and I was forced to buy a new computer. What other option was there to pick a sleek Mac - Powerbook!
Even the box it came in is just wonderful! And now everthing works! Internet, I am sitting on my terrace, swiftly and smoothly... did I just die?
