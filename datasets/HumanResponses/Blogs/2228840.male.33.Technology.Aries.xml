       "Everything that has a beginning, also has an end."   So, I paid the $21.00 matinee price for me and my ever-so-cool girlfriend to see  The Matrix Revolutions  this weekend. I had steadfastly avoided all conversations with friends who had seen it already (no repeat of the mistake made with  The Sixth Sense ...) and ignored all the bad reviews vying for my attention. I made sure  NOT  to buy the extra large Coke that would otherwise have me squirming in my seat an hour into the show, and settled in to see (after 20 agonizing minutes of commercials and previews, of course) if any of the speculations I had following  Reloaded  would pan out.  Well, despite the fact that the special effects had me so mesmerized that I (literally) choked on my own drool (which, for the record, isn't the coolest thing to do in the presence of one's girlfriend), I have to say that I left the theatre feeling like I should have seen more. In fact, not a single one of my theories was realized, leaving me wonder if, somehow, I had been imbued with a greater creative talent than the great Wachowski Brothers themselves. Instead, it seemed as if Neo simply summed the entire trilogy up with a flurry of fists and a few softly-spoken platitudes, wrapped it in a pretty bow, and handed it to the audience. Roll credits.  All in all, definitely  NOT  what I was expecting. Although, the Wachowskis said no one would predict the ending and, in that at least, they were right.  So, here's my completely unsolicited recommendation to the rest of the populous who hasn't witnessed this "end"... If you're a fan of the Matrix at all, you must see  Revolutions ... which goes without saying (but I apparently couldn't resist saying it anyway). However, you might wish catch the matinee or cheap Tuesday, forego the $35 in greasy popcorn and watered down fountain pop, and grab a nice meal somewhere after the show. Trust me, you  WILL  be left hungry.

      "Caffeine is the sunrise in your bloodstream"  A quote I dreamed up in, what I thought of at the time as, a moment of insight. Well, if this is true, then the sun has risen... And now begins the nervous twitching in the back of my brain, the frantic scramble for entertainment, or education, or inspiration, or... No, all of the above. Is there anything new in the world to grab my attention? Anything that I can wrap my mind around for 15 minutes and feel fulfilled?  Ah! A blog! Perhaps a connection to the "outside world" that is, at once, both tenous and without commitment will fill the bill. Perhaps spewing forth empty rhetoric to an uncaring audience will give me some twisted sense of accomplishment, at least for today. And then again, perhaps not. But it's worth a try, isn't it?  Okay, so my attempt to sound eloquent and educated was facinating for all of 5 minutes... Now what do I write about? To be honest, I haven't the faintest clue. However, I  do  know that I'm down to the last swallow of coffee in my mug... I also know that it will be a disgustingly cold swallow... And I know that I will take it anyway... Perhaps a fresh mug and the subsequent caffeine rush will bring inspiration. Stay tuned!

       Not Unlike Joey and Chandler   I have to say, there's nothing in this world quite so cool as good friends. And I'm not talking about the guys at work that you chum around with at the water-cooler (to preserve a time-honored stereo-type)... Nor am I talking about the half-dozen or so people on your MSN contact list that float between "online", "idle", and "away" day in and day out, occasionally saying "hi" or sending you a pointless chain letter... No, I'm talking about those rare individuals that seem to have always "been there". You know, the ones who have seen you at your best and at your worst (sometimes judging, sometimes not) but on whom you can always count.  Now, I don't consider myself to be an overly emotional or sentimental type of guy. Not that there's anything wrong with those traits, it's just not how I was raised. Still, I was recently reminded how much I value my friends, even if I don't often say so.  I was out for coffee the other night with my girlfriend of 7 months and what I consider to be my two best friends. I've known one of the guys for over 15 years, and the other for about 13. As you can imagine, over the course of those years, we've grown to know each other pretty well... To the point where we know how to get a rise out of each other, how far to push a particular line of teasing, and which mine-fields to avoid altogether in a conversation. My girlfriend and I, on the other hand, are still in the process of getting to know each other, really. Yeah, we covered the basics a long time ago, but there's still the odd thing here and there that we learn from time to time. So, it was quite an interesting dynamic as the four of us sat around the table at Perkin's, slugging back pot after pot of the ol' Joe.  I don't know how we did it, but we managed to discuss just about everything from shoe types to corporal punishment... Could have been the 5 hours that we sat there, or the countless cups of Black Gold involved (relax, George W., I'm talking about coffee, so  BACK OFF MAN! )... I don't know. But it was a great time. It felt good to just sit around with people and babble about anything, everything, and nothing all at once. No pressure to impress, no need to embelish the story so I end up being the guy in blue tights and a red cape (private fantasy, sorry...), and no need to wonder if buddy to my left is as full of crap as he sounds. Nah... Just good old fashioned shootin' the... er... breeze.  Of course, we're older than we used to be... When we discuss favorite movies, Breast Content doesn't always ensure an Academy Award Nomination like it used to. Bitching about power-hungry pencil-necked Math teachers has evolved into bitching about power-hungry, pencil-necked Supervisors. And, of course, talking about the girls we'd like to date has turned to talking about the girls we wish we'd never met. Yeah, life has a way of changing you, that's for sure... That's why it's so cool to discover every once in a while that the people who started this journey with you are still there and they still understand you.  So, anyway... There we were, just kickin' back and chatting about something or other, and then it happens... Out of the blue, my girlfriend asks my buddy of 15 years if he thinks I'm a control freak. Have you ever felt time grind to a halt before? Your skin goes cold... You can hear the deep "swish" of blood in your ears with each agonizingly slow heartbeat... And you can literally feel all eyes boring into your skull. Silence. And then, ladies and gentlemen, I knew I was at a crossroads, only  I  wasn't the one at the wheel. My very fate lay in the hands of a friend caught off-guard. You see, I  am  something of a control freak. I know it... He knows it... And my girlfriend was mere seconds away from knowing it. Not that I'm that bad, really... Just a little insistent at times, a little over-bearing, opinionated, stubborn... What was I saying? Oh yeah! But pretty much a nice guy when it comes down to it. But women have this amazing talent for taking your worst trait and making it your  only  trait. So, before my buddy even started to speak the words that could seal my doom, my brain was already racing at break-neck speed to formulate the Mother of all rebuttals...  But the axe never fell. I'm not sure if I'll ever understand it, but my friend, my buddy, my pal found a way to admit my flaw and make it sound like a good thing. I was stunned! Sure, I've been able to justify myself to, well, myself, before, but this guy goes and makes it sound like a trait to be admired! And to top it all off, my other friend jumps in and starts elaborating on it! It truly was a thing of beauty... And so, as the tension vanished from the room, I knew everything was going to be okay. My girlfriend's fears were put nicely to rest, and I knew once again why I call these guys my "best friends".  So, here's to good friends... May we never forget them and always appreciate them. Now, get off your damn computer and go call one!

       "Would You Like Fries With That?"   It's getting to the point where I'm not so sure that the Drive Thru is a convenience anymore. Yes, I can stay in the car instead of fighting for a parking stall... Granted, I can listen to the latest Linkin Park track while I wait instead of some Muzak version of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"... (Which, by the way, can be most depressing... Nothing worse than hearing the "hits" of your "youth" in an elevator...) And, most importantly, I can sit on my butt while someone else does all the leg work. Great! So, what could possibly be wrong with this scenario? How about the minor detail of placing my order?  For years comedians have been making jokes about the Drive Thru speaker. And, for a couple of those years, the jokes were even somewhat amusing. Amusing, that is, until the reality of the situation sank in. Yeah, those damn speakers  are  pathetic! I mean, come on... You can't tell me that, in this day and age of wireless technology, hands-free cellphones, VOX, and a myriad of other technologies that I probably  haven't  heard of, I must be forced to communicate on a level barely above that of the first, "Watson, come in here" from Alexander Graham Bell. Watson, at least, didn't have to lean half-way out a car window and yell, " What?!? "  Alright, I'll admit that I'm exaggerating just a little bit... Chalk it up to dramatic flair, or maybe I just want to sound cool... It's your call. Anyway, sure, the speakers have gotten better in the last few years, but it has only served to reveal a new problem... the Drive Thru staff. Just as we get to the point where we can finally hear what the person in the little booth is saying (and vice versa, presumably), we suddenly have an influx of fast-food employees who cannot seem to communicate in English.  I have to make a side-note here... I am in  no way  prejudiced. I fully agree that people all over the world have the right to speak their native tongue, to pray to their god or gods of choice, and wear traditional or ceremonial garb along with their occupational uniform. More importantly, I believe in everyone's right to pursue a better life for themselves and their families. I take great pride that so many have chosen Canada as their place to do this. That having been said, back to it...  Recently, the City Council here in Calgary met and decided that taxi-cab drivers not knowing enough English was causing a problem. So, they decided to make a daring move and raise the bar a bit. Within the next few years, cabbies will be required to master the English language at a Grade 5 level. I know, it doesn't exactly inspire confidence when compared with your average Grade 5'er... Regardless, my point is this: They recognized the importance of communication in the Service Industry (now I know why  these  guys get to run the city!). Well, if you ask me, I think the same holds true (if not truer) for the Drive Thru window. Yeah, lots of people take cabs, but let's face it, this world practically runs on fast food!  Don't get me wrong... I believe firmly in Equal Opportunity Employment. Go ahead, give the new Canadian a job at the local burger joint... She's got as much right to work as the next person. But let's use a little common sense when figuring out what her position should be. While her English may be strong enough to fill out the application and pass the interview, can she perform the same from behind a microphone? Rob her and her listener of the ability to read facial expressions, body language, and perhaps even lips (to a degree) and can she still cut it? Or is she going to latch on to the few key phrases she recognizes and completely screw up the order? (If you don't know what I'm talking about, try ordering a burger with no pickles, no onions, and extra cheese... ) If not, let her work the inside counter where these tools are available to her. Put someone in the booth that can grasp the language enough to communicate without the eye-to-eye.  But you know what? Even after all is said and done, I know I'll probably keep driving up to that little box, shouting out my order 3 times, and bitch all the way home because I got a damn veggie burger... 'Cuz it's easier, right?  Well, that's it for me today... Please drive around to the second window...

       "Dude, Where's My Oscar?"   Perhaps enough has been said already, if you've been surfing the web or watching TV lately, about " The Butterfly Effect ". But it hasn't been said by me... yet.  I'll be the first to admit that I liked " Dude, Where's My Car? ", despite the kind of reputation that might earn me. And I've always thought the character of Michael Kelso on " That '70s Show " was hilarious.  Ashton Kutcher  (as far as I'm concerned) definitely has a good grasp of the comedic. So, I was a little intrigued when, as I sat waiting for " The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King " to begin, I saw the trailer for " The Butterfly Effect ".  That was about a month ago. Last night, I went to see " The Butterfly Effect " and intrigue soon turned to fascination.  I don't want to spoil the movie, but here's the basic run-down that you get from the trailers:  Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a young man who's life has been plagued with blackouts and lost memories. The son of a man institutionalized for severe mental breakdown, Evan also appears to have the same affliction that eventually drove his father insane. From an early age, a psychologist familiar with his father's case has encouraged Evan to keep a journal in an effort to help him retain his memories and stave off the madness.  Now, seven years after his last blackout, Evan lives a happy and normal college life. But things are about to change... While looking back in one of his journals, he is suddenly thrust backward through time to a moment and a memory previously lost. With the mind of a 20 year old trapped in the body of a 13 year old, he witnesses a traumatic event that forever changed and shaped the lives of the people around him. Upon waking from this "experience", Evan soon learns that his journals provide him with a way to return to the events of the past and change them, to right wrongs, and to shape the past for a better future. Yet, with each attempt to fine-tune the key moments of his past, he awakens to a present that is unexpectedly altered and increasingly disastrous. His frantic attempts to create "the perfect world" begin to make him appear unstable... like his father.  One of the most amazing things about this film is how wonderfully unpredictable it is in its predictability. Even though I could guess how each journey into the past would go wrong, I was always off by just a little bit. It was pleasantly surprising to be wrong. There have been enough " Scream " and " Sixth Sense " type movies lately to make us all experts in the art of detecting sudden 180 degree turn-arounds and surprise endings, but " The Butterfly Effect " is a whole new ballgame.  But, by far, the best thing about this movie is Ashton Kutcher himself. As I said, I've been a fan of his for some time now, but even I was totally unprepared for how brilliantly he shone in " The Butterfly Effect ". I'm sorry if that sounds like schoolgirl gushing, but I truly was impressed. He so accurately displayed the broad range and depth of emotions one would expect from a person enduring the trials of his character as to be 100% convincing. You can feel his pain, his fear, his frantic urgency to fix his mistakes. As used to him as we are from " Punk'd " and " That '70s Show ", here Ashton  is  Evan Treborn.  If there are any lingering questions about him as a future heavyweight in Hollywood, this movie will surely put them to rest.  As the credits rolled last night, I turned to my girlfriend and said, "I haven't seen a movie  that  good in a long time", and I meant it. Although I rarely say this, I recommend that everyone go see this film. Don't wait for the DVD. Don't wait for cheap Tuesday. Don't wait for a matinee. Go tonight... go right now. You  won't  be disappointed!  (for more, visit  urlLink http://www.butterflyeffectmovie.com )

       "Must Be Nice..."   We've all seen it... 3 city workers standing around a ditch with their shovels slung over their shoulders while a fourth guy (and probably the junior on the crew) digs away. And we've all made the same comment: "Must be nice to work for the city." Well, as of today, I'm not so sure...  I woke up yesterday only to find out that a water main had broken somewhere and our water service was a little screwed up. It was  off , exactly, just a little slow. Sure, it took a little longer to fill the coffee pot but, other than that, it wasn't a big deal. In a matter of a couple hours, everything was back to normal. Case closed? Not really.  It normally takes me about 20 minutes to get home from work, in rush hour traffic. Today, it took  an hour and a half ! It was a bumper-to-bumper crawl the whole way. Apparently, that water main problem had partially shut down a 2 kilometer (little over a mile) section of road. It may not sound like a big deal, but when you consider that roughly 8 major communities in the northeast part of our city rely on that road... Well, that changes everything!  As the cars crept along, I couldn't help thinking that this shouldn't be happening. Seriously, the water problem had happened some 34 hours earlier... Surely they could have it cleaned up by now. But, I figured that they were only working on the problem from 9 to 5, like the rest of us, and probably dragging their asses about it, too. I couldn't have been more wrong.  When I finally arrived home, I hopped on the ol' computer and called up some of the local news sites. It turns out that approximately 100,000 people (including a 500 bed  hospital ) were without water for up to 5 hours Sunday morning. A major intersection became flooded with a metre (3 feet, give or take) of water that quickly turned to slush. Motorists who tried to drive through found themselves swamped, with water up to their windows, and had to be rescued by fire crews with a boat! A nasty thing anytime of the year, but imagine it when the mercury is sitting at a bone-chilling  -25 Celsius  (-13 F)!  So, not only did our "lazy city workers" manage to re-route water service for almost a tenth of our city in under 5 hours, but there are now crews of 6 working 9-hour shifts to clean up the ice, locate the break, and repair the damage. All in all, a pretty impressive feat! Sure, a couple lanes of traffic will be re-routed for the rest of the week... Yeah, it's gonna take longer to get home... So what? It sure beats being one of the guys working out there at this very moment, suffering windchills of  -40 Celsius  (that's about -40 in good ol' Fahrenheit, too)!  Hopefully I'll remember all this next summer when I see those 3 guys standing around the ditch... Then again, knowing me, I'll probably just look at them and say, "Must be nice to work for the city..."

       Blah.   What happened to the weekend? One minute I'm sighing a sigh of relief at the end of a work week, and the next I'm thinking about having to get up early tomorrow and get back to it. If only Monday to Friday could go that fast...  Considering that I did  NOTHING  over the past 2 days, you'd think that they would have dragged by. Sure, I watched some hockey, messed around on the ol' computer for a while, read a book (kind of like a computer monitor, but the words are actually  permanently  typed onto papers, and these papers are all bound together). So, not only is the weekend gone, but I have little, if anything, to show for it!  Well, I guess that makes for some pretty boring blogging then, doesn't it?

       Best Ways to Use Your Coffee Break   Okay, so here's a quick one for you all... I just wanted to highlight a few websites that you might want to check out. Yeah, I could stick 'em off to the side of this page under "Links", but you know as well as I do that you won't click on them. Why bother if you don't know what they are, right? All right then, here we go...   urlLink  www.jeremy-smith.net   This is the newly launched "Official Website of Jeremy Smith", an up and coming guitarist on the Calgary music scene. Having been playing for more years than you've had that half-empty jar of tartar sauce in the back in your fridge, he's recently begun working on his first album. Check out the pics from his first-ever photo shoot (definite CD booklet material), view his ever-increasing collection of guitars, and listen to samples of his music.   urlLink  www.dreams2.com   For some of the best Macromedia Flash animation that I've ever seen, visit the site of Magnus Karlsson. Forget "Elf Bowling" or "Gerbil in a Microwave"... Magnus' talent for weaving together sights, sounds, and ideas will truly amaze you. Three different Flash intros will have you eager to check out the 30+ movies you'll find inside. In my opinion, "1979 (not as I expected)", "For the Love of the Game", and "Teenage Wasteland" are among the most impressive and moving pieces... Definitely worth a look.   urlLink  www.clint.ca   By far, one of the most clever and visually pleasing sites on the web today. The nearly tabloid style of the main page will have your eyes bouncing from funny quips to stunning original graphics, from off-the-cuff remarks to pictures that merely leave you wondering, "why?" But dig deeper and it gets even better. Clint Vander Klok's from-the-hip sense of humour and pointed social commentary will have you laughing away your coffee break.  And, finally, one last site that I have to give the  "Time Waster of the Month"  award to...   urlLink  http://home.tele2.fr/kcv/pinguin.swf   Unless your a member of Green Peace, you'll have a hard time resisting this little Flash game.  That's it for now. Happy surfing and don't forget to tell 'em Cuppojoe sent you!

       Go Out With a Bang? More Like a BOMB!   Long time, no blog... Yeah. Actually, long time no anything. At least nothing computer / Internet-related. Funny how the holidays tend to soak up all your time and even more of your money! Well, the mountains of discarded wrapping paper have been dealt with, the tree is down (just), and the Christmas lights on the house... Well, I guess they can stay up another year. So, on with the show!  I'm officially 15 days into the New Year and I can't say it's been too spectacular. Why? Well, just sit back with your hot cup of coffee and I'll tell you why!  I suppose the fact that New Year's Eve was a bust should have been something of an omen. You see, my girlfriend and I, along with her sister, my brother, and my brother's girlfriend all got tickets to this awesome "gala", put on by one of our local radio stations,  JACK FM . Normally, the thought of a "gala" wouldn't have appealed much to me, but seeing as  Tom Cochrane and Red Rider  were to be the live entertainment for the night, I was in. Besides, the tickets said "Wear what you Dare", so at least I wouldn't have to wear a tie!  Thankfully, my "daringness" only extended to black jeans, dress shoes, and a nice shirt (the pattern is called "Bamboo" and it's  really  cool... You should come over and see it sometime). I say this because all 1500+ ticketholders were forced to line up outside the building for an excruciating 45 minutes in the lovely -20 Celsius (that would be -4 F for all you Yankees out there) weather we were treated to that night. You can imagine that some people were very dressed up for the occasion, and I can't believe that nylons were doing much to keep the women warm! It was about this time that the first few shouts of, " JACK sucks! " could be heard...  Yes, eventually we did get inside, around 8:15. And, since we had all paid the extra 20 bucks, we received our meal ticket and hand-stamp to " Dine Around the World ". Doesn't that sound awesome? What an exotic way to feast on the final night of 2003! Well, that was what I was thinking before we got inside... Turned out that "Dine Around the World" referred to about 8 small buffet tables with food from Italy (yep, spaghetti), China (yes indeed, ginger beef), the U.S.A (you can only imagine how long it had been since I had meat and potatoes), and Africa (which, I must say, actually  was  somewhat exotic). To be fair, despite the rather mundane "variety", the food was delicious, so I can't complain too much.  HOWEVER ... Picture this: There had to be at least 300 to 400 people who had opted for the buffet. And there was seating for (and this is  not  an exaggeration) approximately 60 to 70. On top of that, there were small, pub-style tables to stand at for another 50 or so, and that was it! Ever try to cut roast beef with one hand while balancing your plate on the other? Yeah, me neither... Now there were a few more, " JACK sucks! " to be heard.  Now, since this  was  a New Year's party, I know what you're thinking... "If you haven't got a table, and you're eating standing up, where do you put your drink?!?" Ah... Not a problem, my friend.  JACK  took care of that. In the entire building, there were 3 "bars" (the quotes indicating that I'm using the term loosely. In fact, they weren't much more than glorified lemonade stands). And, since these "bars" were staffed by only one or two people each, there were lines of people by the  HUNDREDS  snaking their way this way and that. Average wait-time in line: 30-45 minutes. As you can imagine, as each person got to the "bar", they ordered as much as they could carry. Naturally, the beer-drinkers had an easier time of it, not only because a stack of cans is easier to carry than a bunch of hi-balls, but also because the "bars" were about as well stocked as my first liquor cupboard in college (I could make you anything as long as it contained rum, rye, vodka, and/or Coke). The, " JACK sucks! " trend grew...  And so, the bulk of the evening consisted of: Get in line. Wait. Wait some more. Wait too long. Finally get beer. Chug beer. Get back in line. Try not to lose your buzz while waiting for next acquisition of beer.  Now, I know what you're thinking again... "But at least you had Tom Cochrane and Red Rider to liven up the party!" Well, think again, amigo! Sometime around 8:30 (by which time we were already beginning to regret the $75 each that we had paid), the hosts from  JACK FM , a couple of minimal-talent Morning Show guys by the names of Matt and Eric, came on stage to welcome everyone and announce that Tom and the boys would be starting at 11:00 to help us ring in the New Year! Disappointing, yes, but we figured that they'd just have a DJ spinning some cool dance tracks until then. No different than the big clubs, right? Wrong. No DJ. No dance music. Instead, 2 and a half hours of uninterrupted  JACK FM  format. That's right, just about every 80's and early 90's Rock song you'd ever what to hear! It was like going to huge house party and listening to the  radio  all night! And the chanting of " JACK sucks! " got into full-swing...  Sometime around 9:30, one of the Morning Dudes got back up on stage to remind everyone we were in a Non-Smoking building, and this included the pot they could smell. Not surprisingly, this was met with a volley of "JACK sucks!", to which he had the balls to respond with, "Yeah, but at least we're here, so suck it up!" Now, you just don't see corporate professionalism like that anymore these days...  And now for the Saving Grace of the evening. Tom Cochrane and Red Rider. They came on at 11:00, as promised, and they were brilliant. Plain and simple. Despite the absolute  Gong Show  that  JACK FM  had tried to pass off as a New Year's Gala (and believe me, Tom knew how bad it was, too), those guys put on one hell of a performance! The place came alive in time to greet 2004, which we toasted with our complimentary one ounce of Champaign.  They played until about 1:00, when the party started to wind down and people started for  the  door (singular). Not wanting to get crushed by everyone rushing out to start frozen vehicles, we decided to kick around for a bit until things died down a little. And you'll never guess what happened... Go on! Guess! No, we didn't meet Tom Cochrane. But, as soon as Red Rider's equipment was off the stage, out came a DJ who began spinning club tracks! And he was good! Definitely not one of the  JACK FM  guys, no way! Why he wasn't out earlier in the night, we'll never know... So we stayed until about 2:00 and then decided to leave. Did I forget to mention that the Coat Check was located in a tent  outside  the building? Well, it was. You can just make up you own little diatribe about  that  one... I'm too tired to.  And, if you managed to make it this far, I'm willing to bet that you're pretty tired too. So, I'll take pity on you and recount the  Further Woes of 2004  another time. Now get out of here and grab another cup o' Joe...

       The Comment That Never Was   If you've bothered to read through the  very  long blog just before this one, you may have noticed that someone had a very insightful comment. You wouldn't, however, have seen  what  that comment was, since my " Comments " feature doesn't support very long messages (no matter how good they are)... Sorry.  Fortunately, the comment  was  emailed to me. As I said, very insightful... So, with the permission of the author (who will be referred to as " Doc Atomic "), I am going to post the full content of his email below. Before I do, though, I'd just like to say that I personally know the good Doc, and I've come to respect his opinions and points of view on a broad range of topics. While I might not always agree (or understand), this doesn't make his points any less valid. With that said, I give you  "It's The End of the Whirled, As We Know It..." :  I'd had this thought a couple of years back also, but I don't think it'll fly.  Why?  Look at the historical examples.  For instance; in my record collection, I have examples of the highest state of the art: Original Master recordings; Japanese pressings on absolutely pure virgin vinyl; and even a rare, limited-quantity *direct-to-disc* recording -- the highest fidelity that has ever _been_ attained in consumer-available audio!  These types of pressings enjoyed a *brief* flurry of availability a quarter-century ago, but never really became "popular" enough to justify their production cost -- and so, they died; and it wasn't even the advent of CDs that killed them... it was simply due to the lack of a real market; the vast majority of people had *grown up* with the mass-produced 'lo-fi' crap, and that _was_ "music" to *them*... hell; most people to this very day _still_ wouldn't recognise true high fidelity sound even if it was played loud enough to blast their tympani straight  down through their Eustacian tubes and out their assholes.  The first thing that came to my mind when you mentioned "lower-quality" distribution, though, was not music; it was 'bootleg' movies.  Imagine: some wank-off sitting in a movie theatre with a cheap vidcam -- dark picture; echoing sound; severe 'keystone' distortion due to the angle of seating; heads bobbing in front of the camera; coughing, and other audience noises -- this sort of shit actually *sells*!  In fact, it was exactly how I first seen "The Scorpion King", and a couple of other equally-forgettable ones... on cheap, mass-stamped (_not_ CDR) VCDs, sold in the streets by the *millions*.  Quality be damned, eh?  I think you are certainly partly right, with the issue of cost -- but; to that, I would also add _availability_, and *convenience*... which brings me back to those hi-fi pressings, because; although "fidelity" was highly-touted as "The Issue" when vinyl was being replaced by CDs, it was actually false -- as I pointed out above, higher fidelity than CDs certainly did exist at the time and in fact, has never since been equalled.  No; the *real* selling advantage of CDs back then was the _convenience_ -- the ability to play any track, in any order, any number of times, *immediately*, or even _remotely_ -- with no preparation (cleaning) or attention (care in placing the stylus on the groove properly) being necessary.  As a result, we lost the "3D" dimensionality of the stereo image -- which CDs _cannot_ reproduce, simply because of their time resolution limitation -- and now, it is no longer possible to distinguish the *spaces between* the instruments being played; instead, we get only a "flat wall" of sound, instead of a sense of actually _being_ there *in* the performance (or audience).  And by-and-large, the vast majority of people never even noticed.  The same thing is happening right now, with .mp3 files.  By definition, .mp3 is a _lossy_ format -- meaning, the quality is NOT as good as the original.  Like the 'fringing' artifacts seen in .jpg images, .mp3 files suffer from loss of definition, 'hollowness', and misphasing... and again, people simply don't give a shit, because the .mp3 format is _convenient_... just pop your player onto a USB port in some NetsCafe (or at work), and download your day's tuneage.  "Price" doesn't even *begin* to enter the picture!  I predict that within ten years, we will see the pressing of the very last CD.  Of course, they'll be gone from Europe and NorthAm long before that, but, there'll always be a handful of "holdouts"... and, the "have-not" countries, overseas -- which is where it will actually happen.  And by then, we will no longer have *any* choice about it... "fidelity" will have degraded yet another order of magnitude lower, and we will have NO alternatives.

       "Aye, Matey!"   If there's one thing that the music and film industries need to realize, it's that the war is already over.  For the past few years, they've been trying to fight against the rising wave of  piracy  and  file-swapping  that they claim is destroying their business, but to little avail. A volley of attacks have been launched against Internet Service Providers, file-swapping services, and, most recently, end-users themselves. Still, success in stemming the flow of bootleg material across the vastness of the Internet has remained elusive. So far, each assault has only served to teach their opponents how to better hide behind the anonymity of the 'Net and how to develop more efficient methods to " rip " and " swap " everything from 80's music and video games to full-length feature films still showing in the theatres.  The futility has become most evident recently with the propaganda we are now subjected to during the " Coming Attractions "... Who hasn't had to sit and listen to some poor guy go on and on about how hard he works to make a movie and how it takes money out of his pocket each time someone downloads a copy? Come on! This isn't even a valid argument... The people who make the films don't suffer because all they do is raise the prices. Actually, it's the paying public who hurts in the long run. Remember when it only cost 5 bucks to see a movie? Yeah, me too... barely. And here's the funniest part about it all... The ever-increasing prices are only going to encourage people to download more! It's high time for the music and film industries to admit defeat on this front and try to salvage what they can.  A quick word before I continue... I am  not  promoting the piracy and/or sharing of copyright material. I think the debate over the moral and legal standpoints of this topic has raged on long enough. Instead, I'd rather focus on where to go from here.  Why do most people download music instead of buying it? Why spend hours getting " 50 First Dates " from the Internet instead of just going to the cineplex? The real thing is just too expensive, that's why. It's not because the common man (or woman, for those of you who adhere to political correctness) is lawless by nature, thumbing his (or her) nose at authority. And it's not because they want to see the artists suffer in spite of their efforts. It's all about money. Why continue to keep up with rising prices year after year when " reasonable facsimiles " can be obtained for free? And, as I mentioned above, it's only going to get worse as the prices are pushed through the roof to make up for losses due to bootlegging. So, what is the answer then? While I firmly believe that it is impossible to stop piracy, I also think it can be slowed down by reducing the  need  to copy and share.  A close friend of mine and I were talking about this very topic over a year ago, and he put forth an idea that I thought was brilliant. So, of course,  I'll  tell you all about it and, even though I've just given the credit to him, you'll always remember that you read it here first and think of  me  as the genius. I love it when a plan comes together...  This battle didn't begin with  Kazaa  and the millions of people who opened their hard drives to each other to share the latest movies... Nor did it begin with  Napster  and the countless MP3s that flooded the Internet. In fact, this goes back further than the Internet, further digital media, further even than the home computer itself. For as long as there has been art, there has been someone to copy it. And for as long as there has been someone to copy it, there has been someone who would settle for a copy over the original. So, if this is true, how is it that painters, sculptors, and authors today still manage to survive? Why hasn't piracy destroyed them by now, especially considering how much longer they've been subjected to it? This is why: They found a way to  embrace it  and  profit from it .  Very few of us can afford a painting by the likes of  Picasso . To actually own a piece sculpted by  Michelangelo  is unthinkable. To read a book written in the hand-writing of  Charles Dickens  himself would be a once-in-a-lifetime event. Yet, the works of these three are readily available to any man, woman, or child who wishes to experience them... thanks to copies. The reproductions of these great works have done nothing to diminish the originals. Without question, they aren't as good, but for those who can't or won't afford the real thing, they provide an excellent alternative.  The proposal put forth by my friend was a simple one... Offer two levels of purchase for the consumer. For those who prefer to own " the best ", continue to provide high-quality CDs and DVDs with all the fancy packaging and artwork. For those who don't find this necessary or who can live without the " perfect sound ", offer music and movies in a cheaper, slightly inferior form. Strip out things like a flashy jewel case, booklet insert, or "DVD extras" and offer a trimmed down version. Allow music-lovers a way to purchase 30 or 40 MP3s (of their choice) burned onto a personalized CD  right in the music store . Then, offer these alternatives at a price that would make them attractive and people wouldn't be so compelled to download the stuff from the 'Net.  Sure, there will always be people who would rather spend 16 hours downloading something they could pay 3 dollars for, but they are few and far between. Also, since file-sharing relies heavily on  lots  of people doing it, eventually even these die-hards would have to opt for the legal alternative.  I know this may sound a little Utopian right now... And there are complexities that I haven't (and won't) touch on. But it's the beginning of a plan. More importantly, it's the beginning of a plan that has  everyone's  best interests in mind. It's not just a way to control the illegal spread of copyright material, and it's not just a way to lower prices... It's both. Not to mention the fact that, if artists are faced with the need to convince us to buy the "full price" version, we may see a marked increase in the quality of products offered. In the end, everyone wins.  So, maybe I was a little hasty in claiming that the war is already over... But we certainly are in the final stages. If the pieces are played correctly, we'll have a stalemate that will let everybody walk away from the table happy.

       Caught Between a Rose and a Hard Place   Well, boys, that time of year is upon us once again... That's right, now that we've finally recovered (mentally and financially) from the ordeal of finding those "perfect" Christmas gifts for our beloved women, we are once more faced with a holiday that could very easily set the tempos of our relationships for the rest of the year...  Valentine's Day  is here.  Since the day after Boxing Week, we've seen the hearts and cupids hanging in the Hallmark card stores, reminding us that our time to brush up on the fine art of romance is running short. We've had our year of scratching ourselves in public, passing gas under the sheets, and laughing at the  Naked Gun  movies... Now, it's time to remind our ladies just why they chose us over all others and (hopefully) erase from their minds the image of us dancing at last year's company Christmas party.  I truly wanted this blog to be one of hope for us, guys. I wanted to give tips on picking the perfect gift, something that would make any woman's heart melt. And I wanted to teach a few little romantic gestures that never fail to take a woman back to that first moment when she looked at you and knew you were " the one ". I wanted this to be the year that we prove we really  can  be everything the diamond commercials have taught them we are... But let's face it, who am I kidding?  I'm just like the rest of you. When it comes to Valentine's Day, I might as well be a deer in the headlights (except, for the deer, the end is a lot quicker and less messy). I know my special lady has been waiting in breathless anticipation for the past month to see just how sweet, thoughtful, and romantic I'm going to be. What I don't necessarily know, is how to  be  all those things... I'm a  guy , for crying out loud! My idea of thoughtful is showing her how to jiggle the handle on the toilet to stop it from running all night. And my experience with "romance" pretty much consists of those 5 minutes before love-making when I stroke her arm, cross one leg over hers and, with a raise of my eyebrows, say, "So... uh... You wanna?"  I do  not , however, think that giving her flowers is particularly thoughtful or romantic. How much thought does it take to walk into a florist, throw down 50 bucks, and ask for a dozen roses? None, that's how much. And you know why? Because if guys pondered the idea for even  2 seconds , they'd kick their own asses for dropping that much cash on something that is going to sit in a jar for 3 days before dying and, ultimately, being tossed stems-up into the garbage can. A bloody 2 dollar  goldfish  has better chances and more economic appeal than that! But, I digress...  In the end, guys, we're going to do what we always do... We're going to put off doing anything about Valentine's Day until the actual day arrives. Then, we're going to scramble around to find something,  anything , that might pass as a gift. And we're going to call every nice restaurant in town, only to find out that nothing is available thanks to all the pansy-ass, whipped guys who thought to make reservations in advance. Which will, inevitably, lead to us proclaiming that it is  far  more romantic to make supper for our women and serve it by candlelight. Unfortunately, considering our culinary skills, this will consist of spaghetti with sauce from a jar, Baby Duck wine, and one of those fat red candles with the fake holly berries left over from the Christmas decorations. Some things will never change...  But wait! I wanted to leave you all with a little bit of hope... A friend of mine by the name of  Clint Vander Klok  (perhaps you've heard of him...?) has stumbled across a way for our women to repay us for the trials and tribulations we endure at this time of year  and  bring a long-awaited balance to the universe. If you'd like to find out what this brilliant answer to all men's prayers is, just surf on over to  urlLink  http://www.clint.ca/oldnews/steak.htm  ... I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

       Commentary on Comments   I don't know what it is about today... Maybe I didn't get enough sleep last night... Or maybe someone slipped decaf into the coffee maker at work (" morning people " should be exiled to a remote northern iceflow where they can grin happily at each other all day and leave the rest of us to bitch until noon like nature intended)... But, whatever it is, I sure feel strange.  Normally, I'm a fairly well-adjusted guy. I do what I do, say what I say, and it doesn't really matter what anyone thinks about it (with the exception of upper-management, for whom I've reserved a generous yet dignified form of sucking-up). But, when I woke up this morning, something was different. Suddenly, I want to know what people think of me! I couldn't believe it! So, I scurried to the blog page to scan for comments on my entries...  Lo and behold (which phrase may give the impression I'm more advanced in years than I really am)... a few comments, but nothing recent (and, sadly, I recognize the 2 people who left them). "So," I wondered to myself, "What are the  rest  of them thinking? Why have they not applauded my efforts or denounced me as a charlatan? What am I going to have for supper tonight?" As enticing as that little " Comment (0) " link is, practically  begging  to be clicked, I can only assume that it is only by the most incredible force of will that you are all able to resist the overwhelming urge to put your 2 cents in...  And so, today I write about nothing and I turn this blog over to you. What do you think? How do you feel? What do  you  think I should have for supper? Take advantage of this limited time offer... The  Return of the Apathy  is right around the corner... If you're too shy to comment, then email me at  urlLink cuppojoe71@hotmail.com .

       Super Bowl Booby-Prize (or "How I Jumped on the Band-Wagon and Wrote About Janet Too")   Let’s just cut to the quick, shall we? We can sit around all day debating whether or not seeing Janet’s right funbag during the Super Bowl Half-time Show was offensive or not… The fact of the matter is, it’s highly doubtful that she even cares! I imagine that the only thing going through her mind in the seconds before Justin copped the infamous feel was, “I sure hope this works!”  The whole thing is about exposure (don’t pardon the pun… appreciate it). Growing up with the  Jackson 5  and having a string of hit songs in the ‘80s and ‘90s couldn’t help but set her up for stardom… But even being the sister of one of the biggest freaks of our time can’t keep her in the spotlight forever. And so,  Operation Flashdance  was born.  I don’t think that anyone can blame the girl for trying to get our attention. Hell, even my writing this is an attempt to get attention on  some  level. And you really can’t blame her when it appears to have done the trick. Apparently, the words “Janet Jackson’s Breast” have become the most searched for phrase in the history of the Internet. Gee whiz!  That  took all of three days! So, she’s getting exactly what she bargained for when she dreamed up this whole stunt… Or is she?  Sure, Janet Jackson is the name on everyone’s lips right now… Yes, you can watch the sordid incident in dramatic slo-mo (with the offending body part blurred out to protect its identity) at any given hour of the day or night… And even websites dedicated to higher schools of thought like  urlLink www.clint.ca  are filled with commentary and opinions on the subject. But is all this coverage over lack of coverage really going to do Ms. Jackson any good?  While it may be true that the only bad press is no press at all, I’m a little bothered by this stunt. Not necessarily by the fact that 89 million people (including a fair amount of youngsters) were subjected to 1 second of bare breast during a prime time sporting event, but more so by the way it was handled. “Wardrobe malfunction”, they said… “Completely unintentional”, they claimed… Well now… I consider myself to be fairly secure and comfortable with my body, but suddenly expose my tally-whacker for 89 million people to see and I’m sure I’d act very differently than she did! No, her mock astonishment was as scripted and choreographed as the rest of the performance. So, instead of following in her brother Michaels’s footsteps, she quickly dropped the lie (“Are you serious?!? Only one operation on your nose to help you breathe?”) and decided to come clean. Now she’s the contrite little schoolgirl who never meant to offend anybody…  Well, I’m sorry Janet, but you  did  offend me. I personally don’t care if you choose the get naked in public or not… anymore than I cared when Britney kissed Madonna… but when you insult my intelligence,  everybody’s  intelligence, by lying about the motivations behind such a career-boosting stunt, I have to call “ bullshit ”. You went for cutting-edge, tried to be the rebel, but came off looking like a poser.  And  that , my friends, is the naked truth.

       The Project   Guess what I'm going to do today... I'm going to frustrate myself! Sounds like fun, doesn't it? Well, if you only knew! Even though it's Sunday, and I could be sitting around, relaxing, and watching TV, I'm going to do something that I'm sure will have me pulling my hair out and wondering why I didn't just stay in bed. Today, I'm going to build a computer for my girlfriend.  Now, it wouldn't be so bad if I was taking a few hundred bucks down to my local computer retail store to buy brand new parts. In fact, it would be a absolute pleasure to pick up a nice P4 3.0 processor, motherboard, 2GB of DDR RAM, DVD-Burner, and a 19" LCD Flat Panel monitor... (Oops! Just started drooling on the keyboard...) However, since  champagne wishes  and  caviar dreams  don't exactly match my  beer  and  potato chips  budget, I'm gonna have to settle for a little less...  So, instead, I'll rummage through the parts I've tossed into a box each time I've upgraded my computer. Let's see what we've got here... Hmm... Well, looks like I'll be building a sweet PII 500MHz (smokin'!) machine with 192MB of SDRAM (sigh..) and an 8x CD-Burner. Wow, it's depressing just reading over what I've just written! Oh well... What are ya gonna do, eh?  I've always said that putting a computer together is like playing with Lego... You just snap the parts together, and there you go. Of course, installing  Windows  is another thing... Anybody wanna guess how many network cards I go through before I find one Windows will recognize? Then I'll have to sit through about  2   hours  of  Windows Updates ... Then a whole new install when I realize the hard drive is bad (isn't that why I bought a new one in the first place?)... Girlfriend asking, "Is it almost done?" for the tenth time... More  Windows Updates ... I think you see where this is going, and I'm willing to bet that a few of you have been there yourselves.  So gang, wish me luck... Once more into the fray... If I'm not back in a week, tell my family I love them and not to eat the tartar sauce...

       Shameless Self-Promotion   You see that little grey box just to the right? There, just below the links to my email... Yeah, that's the one! Well, for those of you who have been wondering what that is, let me tell you...  That is a genuine blog belonging to someone that I have never met, nor am I ever likely to meet. In fact, odds are, I've never even heard of that particular blog before, let alone  read  it. Never the less, there it sits, proudly displayed for all my loyal reader (note the humorous use of the singular "reader") to see. Why, you might ask, would a seemingly random blog (for that is what I've labeled it) be displayed, nay,  touted as noteworthy  in the sidebar of  "Musings" ? Well, it's quite simple, really... I'm a  BlogSnob .  Easy now... It's not as bad as it sounds. Although I would probably have come up with a better name for the idea, it is a great idea, regardless. And here's how it works...  Now that I have joined the ranks of BlogSnobs (BlogSnobbers?) world-wide, each time my blog is viewed, two things happen. First, the blog of another BlogSnob member is advertised on my page (Remember that little grey box I was talking about? Good. Just making sure I hadn't lost you). And second, my blog is advertised on the page of another member. Simple, no? In this way, people such as yourself are presented with the chance to expand your Blog horizons while tireless Bloggers such as myself get the chance to attract new readers.  So, now that you're done reading this boring Blog (there's better stuff to come, I promise), why not click on that one to your right and see what it's all about? What's that? It doesn't look interesting to you? Well, just keep refreshing this page until you see one that does! Meanwhile, I'll be here trying to think of something clever for next time... Wish me luck!

       %@&#$!   I'm in a bad mood. In fact, I'd have to describe my current attitude as  foul . At this very moment, my keyboard is taking quite a beating, I can assure you. I can feel the pulsing in my neck, my brow is furrowed, and my teeth are clenched. My brain is scrambling around in tight little frustrated circles...  This is me when I'm pissed off.  The worst thing about feeling this way has to be the underlying helplessness of the moment. I can analyze how I'm feeling, I can understand how I'm feeling, I can even paint a vivid little picture of how I'm feeling... But I can't  stop  it. I can't break out of this funk, no matter how hard I try. What's up with  that , anyway?!? Am I not master of my own mind? Should I not be able to flip my mental middle finger at that which annoys me and be done with it?  Apparently not.  So, I play a little  Unreal Tournament  to ease the tension and take my mind off things... You'd think that spraying rocket fire around like Silly String to the chants of  "Double Kill!"  and  "Multi Kill!"  would take the edge off. But, it turns out that virtual violent bloodshed in outer space isn't an effective method of anger management. All I've done is add a less-than-healthy dose of adrenaline to the mix. Looks like my imaginary shrink was right again...  Then I try to write a blog, but everything comes out sounding bitchy (What's that? You hadn't noticed?). Four times I log into  Blogger , get two sentences in, and close the window. Four more times I relaunch Explorer, only to glare at Google, becoming more and more irked by that stupid  "I'm Feeling Lucky"  button... Twice I get up from my computer, then sit right back down again. More teeth clenching, more brow furrowing... I'm a prisoner and my anger is my prison cell.  It's 11 o'clock at night and I should go to bed. Of course, if I do, I'll just lay there staring at the ceiling until the streetlights make taunting little faces out of the stipple. Then I'll grab a book, read three pages, realize I can't remember a single thing from the last three pages, and put it down again.  Toss, turn, re-adjust pillow...  Before long I'd be right back here at the computer, suffering my tension by its eerie glow. So, I might as well skip a few steps and just stay here until this passes, right? I better go put on some coffee... But before I do, I guess I should end the suspense. You want to know what's got me so riled up? Would you like me to tell you what's got my knickers in a knot? My computer... of course.   AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!

       Oh, the agony...   I once read somewhere that women don't remember the pain of childbirth. Supposedly, this is nature's way of ensuring that they will go through the whole process again and our dominant species will continue to pillage and plunder its way across the face of this great blue marble. Nifty little trick, don't you think?  Well, just the other day, as I sat at my tiny little desk in my tiny little office, suffering the effects of the previous night's alcohol-induced escapades and wondering why I put myself through this torture, it hit me. Maybe Mother Nature doesn't reserve this  "Now you remember it, now you don't"  routine for our life-givers, our childbearers... Perhaps she also smiles upon this hapless imbiber of spirits, allowing me to revel in my stupidity, free of the fear of what the morning will bring. Blocked from my mind are the hours spent in head-pounding agony as my body shivers uncontrollably from what must be my insides attempting to become my outsides... Gone, too, are the memories of the waves of nausea that banish all thoughts of food, bring me to my knees, and leave me as weak as a kitten. Most of all, completely forgotten are my countless past pledges to "never drink again".  Not that I don't remember ever having a hangover, mind you. But even as I write about the terrible trials and tribulations brought on by a night of excess, I feel a certain detachment. I know I suffered these things, but I don't remember the actual suffering to be all that bad. Interesting... Perhaps there is more to this connection with bringing a child into the world...  Most certainly, hangovers and childbirth share similar origins as both begin with very pleasurable and exciting events. These events tend to make the participants lose themselves in the moment with much giggling, funny faces, and proclamations of, "I love you". Quite often, people will even achieve new levels of boldness, saying or doing things they would normally be too embarrassed to consider. And, ultimately, the end arrives with an uncontrollable and undeniable urge to sleep. It should be noted, however, that one of these events is traditionally shared between two people, while the other can involve as many people as the venue will support. Which is which would depend upon your lifestyle, I suppose...  Now, here is where the differences begin to surface. Although both will spend some time huddled over a toilet bowl, an expecting mother has the better part of nine months to prepare for her big day, while the drunk has mere hours... hours which are typically spent sleeping instead of preparing. The mom-to-be is out taking Lamaze classes, eating healthy, and arranging which hospital to use. The drunk, on the other hand, is drooling away his last few ounces of moisture in a bed that tips and spins like some evil carnival ride, without a single thought for how to deal with what awaits him. She enters childbirth with excitement and anticipation, surrounded by loved ones. He awakens to find himself already in the midst of his personal hell, with no one there to make it better.  And, when all is said and done, Mom will be pampered and loved. She will be told to rest. Gifts and flowers will be lavished upon her, as will words of congratulations. As for our other guy, well... He'll have to drag his dying body out of bed and off to work. There, he'll not only have to endure the longest hours of his life, but also all the ridicule and mocking his co-workers can throw at him. Still, just as the memory of childbirth will fade, so will the memory of his pain. And they are both likely to go through the whole thing again...  So, in the end, is there a "bigger connection" between childbirth and hangovers as this blog would seem to suggest? Have I stumbled across some greater truth that will bridge the gap between the sexes? I don't think so. As a matter of fact, if this blog proves anything, it's this:  Drinking kills brain cells .

       The Price of a Freebie   My thumbs are sore. Now, that wouldn't be too shocking if I was some cross-eyed, ambidextrous carpenter with masochistic tendencies (don't laugh, I'm pretty sure I saw it on  Jerry Springer ), but I'm not. Nor am I one of the millions of PlayStation, Nintendo, and XBox junkies who feverishly rub, slide, and grind their opposable digits across ergonomic but unforgiving gamepads day and night. No, I'm just a simple Canadian boy who, if you haven't heard by now, has a thing for coffee. And, thanks to that, my thumbs are sore.  For those of you who are Canadian, you may already see where I am going with this. You may even share my pain... For those of you who aren't from  The Great White North , or those of you who, in an attempt to keep those old stereotypes alive, have been living in an igloo, let me start at the beginning and introduce you to a little place called  Tim Horton's .  Just as our friends to the south in the good ol' US of A have  Starbuck's  (you know, that little coffee shop that you can find on  every  corner in  every  town?), we have Tim Horton's. Of course, you won't find " tall ", " grande ", or " venti " on the menu... I'm afraid you'll have to settled for small, medium, large, or (my favorite)  extra large . Oh, and we're talking about  coffee  here, not espresso, latte, or even soy latte. Don't bother looking for the biscotti either... but feel free to try the Honey Crullers, they're  awesome !  Okay, so it's not a trendy sidewalk cafe... It's a donut shop. But it means the same to every citizen of the True North, Strong and Free as Starbuck's means to Seattlites. It defines our country as much as the  Loonie ,  Hockey Night in Canada , and  beer . Mike Myers even paid a little tribute to this fine institution in  Wayne's World ... Remember Stan Mikita's, the donut shop where Garth saw his dream girl for the first time (Foxy Lady)? Well, just like Tim Horton, Stan Mikita was an NHLer from yester-year. Clever, eh? Anyway, Tim Horton's is the one place that you can count on finding a great cup of coffee no matter where you go in this massive country of ours.  So, anyways, about my poor thumbs... Tim's runs a contest once or twice a year that they call  Roll Up the Rim to Win  in which, as the name would suggest, you unroll the rim at the top of their paper coffee cups to (hopefully) reveal a prize. It could be a free coffee... It could be a free donut... And if you're one of the luckier people, it could be a 37" Plasma TV or an  SUV ! So, here I am, already heavily addicted to the drink, and now I have this carrot dangling before my eyes! Of course, when Roll Up the Rim time hits, I'm a rolling  freak ... I'm slugging back cup after cup (which probably isn't all that different from my normal coffee drinking habits, but it works for the story so lets go with it), I'm rolling up the rims, and I'm... well... actually, that's about all I'm doing because I  can't win a thing ! It's bad enough that, for the first week or so of the contest, I am constantly digging in the garbage for the cup I threw away an hour ago because I forgot to check the rim. Then, to not even get a reward for my efforts, well, it's maddening! It says right on the cup that the odds of winning a food prize (the most abundant of the prizes) are approximately 1 in 9, but I'm still batting zero!  What gives?!?   Instead, I get to read those 3 little words that I have come to loath even though I obey them like Pavlov's dog:  Please Play Again .  Ding! I'm back in line at Tim Horton's, ordering my extra large black coffee to go, double-cupped once again. I have to get it double-cupped because Tim's keeps their coffee at a temperature equivalent to the surface of the  sun , but they don't offer those fancy cardboard jackets to protect your already battered fingers... Of course, the second cup isn't one of the contest cups because that wouldn't be fair to the guy behind me in line. Speaking of which, look who just won a Mountain Bike... No good son of a...

       Investigative Journalism At Its Best   Outside of hunting down that first coffee of the day, I have very few morning rituals, that I am aware of. One, however, is to sit with said first cup of coffee and peruse the headlines on cnn.com. First, I check out the major news of the moment, conveniently located to the upper-right where all major things should be located (my apologies to all my lower-left loving readers...). I'll click on anything that looks mildly interesting, which immediately excludes pieces on the War in Iraq, American politics, and Martha Stewart. I  did  read about her long-awaited conviction, but that's not news, it's entertainment. Anyway, after a quick read, I'll back my browser up to the main page and scan for any other tidbits that might tickle my fancy or float my boat, depending on the day. Always, though, I visit the  Technology  section last, because, as everyone knows, that's where the fun stuff is.  I'm not talking about the latest worm to bring Outlook to its knees (when as the last time you  really  got an important, must-read email from  qzxvksty@openme.com ?) or frontline news from the  War on Piracy  (you already know my stance on  that )... No, I'm talking about the really good articles... Like ones about the  Segway , that self-balancing, 2-wheeled contraption that they thought would be all the rage with downtown executives, airport commuters, and mail carriers. Well, it's pretty hard to think of something that can be stumped by a flight of stairs or a curb as a " breakthrough in modern technology "... Imagine, all the convenience of a wheelchair without the need to sit down! Wow! Still, it makes for an entertaining read. Or, how about  Bill Gates'  latest and greatest idea? Have you heard that he's proposing we start  paying  for every email we send? Sure, he touts it as a way to help stop spammers by making it an unprofitable venture, but let's face it, we all know where  he'd  like to see the money end up... I bet it rhymes with Nicrosoft... It's a laugh, and that's often just what I need to start my day.  But, just the other day, I read an article in the Tech section with the headline, " Study: Very few bloggers on Net ". I was stunned. Even being a fairly recent arrival on the blogging scene myself, I have seen more blogs by a greater variety of people than I ever would have suspected. So, naturally, I had to read on.  (You can read the article  urlLink  here  , for as long as the link lasts)  After doing a survey, they (and I'm talking about the all-knowing, all-seeing  They  behind all good studies, rumors, and legends) found that only about 2 to 7 percent of adult internet users in the United States keep a blog and, of those, only about 10 percent update them daily. And of the 11 percent or so of people who actually read blogs, most prefer to read the ones of strangers over those of family or friends. Shocking. Or is it? Let's break it down, shall we?  First of all, they apparently surveyed adults instead of  teens . Although my years of running wild and sneaking into bars are far behind me, I can still admit that the vast majority of new technologies are more readily embraced by the younger generation. So, obviously, the survey was narrow in scope and poorly targeted. Even so, 2 to 7 percent is still a pretty big number when you think about it. What percentage of American adults do you think keep a diary? Publish articles? Write books? I doubt it's as high.  Secondly, it's not surprising at all that only 10 percent of active bloggers update their sites on a daily basis. Unless you are the kind of person who feels the need to tell the world about  every  sandwich you make,  every  show you watch,  every  phone call you take, it's pretty difficult to come up with things to write about everyday. Don't get me wrong... Those kind of blogs definitely have their place. I even read a few for fun, from time to time. They are like little snapshots of everyday life. But, for the rest of us, it's more about finding  something  to write  about , and sometimes there just isn't anything worth the time at the keyboard.  As for people liking to read strangers' blogs... Duh! No kidding! It's because the lives or points of view of people we don't know are interesting and intriguing (well, I think  mine  are, anyway...). Family and friends are wonderful and irreplaceable, but we see them and speak to them all the time. To turn around and then read all their thoughts would be redundant at best and totally boring at worst. It's the very same reason we'd rather watch an episode of  The Real World  instead of home movies...  So, all in all, I'm not sure what the point of the whole article was... The statistics were empty, the expectations were unstated, and the conclusion was misleading. Come to think of it, the only interesting thing about the article is the fact that the article exists at all! Cool, in a weird sort of way, when you think about it...  Wait. Did I just write a blog about the lack of blogging going on? Oh crap... I hope this doesn't cause the universe to fold over on itself... Somebody call CNN...

       I Can't Say I'm Lovin' It...   And so, the end of an era draws to a close... Forget about the troubles in the  Middle East , never mind that  John Kerry  won 9 out of 10 states on  Super Tuesday , and let someone else worry about the evidence of water on Mars... Instead, turn your sights to the real News of the Day, what will surely be  The Headline Heard 'Round The World: "McDonald's To Phase Out Super Size" .  I awoke in the early hours of the morning to the usual traffic reports and weather forecasts that urge me from my peaceful slumber everyday, only to find myself sitting bolt upright in my bed as I heard the terrible news. McDonald's will no longer be offering the Super Size option with their Combo Meals. My first reaction was one of utter amazement. "This can't possibly be true!", I thought to myself (which, by the way, is a fairly coherent thought for me to have before my first coffee of the day). Perhaps I hadn't heard the whole story and they were talking about the latest headline from  The National Enquirer ... Or, maybe, in my caffeine-deprived state, I had experienced the equivalent of an auditory hallucination.  As I showered, incredibly overpriced shampoo dripping into and stinging my eyes (no sacrifice too great in the defense of the hairline), I paused... "Would they really kill the Super Size?" I wondered. "Nah... That's crazy!" Then, putting the worry out of my mind, I proceeded into the all important  rinse and repeat . You know, just once I'd like to defy that little  Cosmetic Commandment ... But I'm afraid that the  Almighty Creator of Good Hair  would smite the remaining locks from head, leaving me to seek whatever solace I can find in fast cars, gaudy jewelry, and cheesy pick-up lines.  From that point on, my morning ablutions went as usual...  Ablutions . Fancy word, eh? It's real... Look it up. I had to... Anyway, with a quick sniff, I determined which pile of wrinkled laundry was the clean one and got dressed. Then with a quick shave (why doesn't  Male Pattern Baldness  ever strike  there ?) and a smearing of deodorant, I was on to the brushing of the teeth... At which point I paused once again, this time to admire how the lathered toothpaste made me look like a well-groom rabid psychopath. Perhaps I should mention that to my imaginary shrink...  All was well until about 6 minutes into my ride to work. Once again, morning radio did it's little  Traffic and Weather Square Dance , then moved on to the 10 second blurbs that are the only kind of news the freshly-awakened human mind is able to comprehend. And there it was again. This time it was presented by some goofy DJ that probably should have gone to bed early instead of staying up late to write his "jokes", but the message was the same...  McDonald's is getting rid of their Super Size . Well, there was no denying the reality of it then.  For years, that smiling clown with the funky red hair has been giving us the most amazing deals on what must be narcotically-enhanced fries (how else to explain their obsessively addictive goodness?), but the free ride is over. Sure, the size of the pop (soda, if you're one of our southern neighbors) is going to shrink, too, but I don't think I'm going to miss those last 10 or 12 swallows of warm Coke, diluted to the color of herbal tea as much as I'll miss those salty little sticks of heaven.  Well, at least they aren't getting rid of the fries completely, but I think our society is in for a shake-up. Fights over  The Last Fry  will become more intense, the time-honored ritual of "stealing" a handful of fries from a friend, no questions asked, will come to an end and, more importantly, we're going to have to get used to hearing the words, "Would you like even  more  fries with that?"

      I want to take you all back exactly one year today...  I had been chatting rather amiably with a nice girl that I met through  Yahoo Personals  for about 2 weeks. In "my day", that would have been a strange way to meet someone ("Why not just go to the club?"), but I'm a liberally minded, 21st-century guy, so there you have it.  Anyway, we made a date to meet each other for the first time in person on April 28th. I'll be the first to admit that the idea of a blind date had me quaking in my boots (okay, I don't wear boots, but you get the picture...). And, from what I have since learned, she wasn't much calmer about the proposition. Still, being two grown adults, we swallowed our fears and met on that fateful day.  We chose to go to a movie (always a safe bet for a first date) and, since there was a bookstore right next to the theatre, I suggested we meet there.  I made sure to arrive  well  ahead of time, so I could stake out a good spot. I wanted to see  every  person who came in so I'd be sure not to miss her. I had only seen a couple of pictures of her and I had no idea how old they were... How embarrassing if I didn't recognize my date! So, I grabbed a book and managed to find a chair that gave me a perfect view of the only door. If only I hadn't picked such a good book...  As I was becoming very engrossed in the fiction, I suddenly felt very much that I was being watched... I looked first to the door, hoping it was just my intuition alerting me to her entrance. Nothing. Then I turned turned to my left, and there she was.  The first thing I noticed is that she was trying very hard to blend into the bookcase she was hugging for dear life. Okay, well at least I wasn't alone in my nervousness... The next thing I noticed was that she was far prettier than the pictures I had been sent. Naturally, this pleased me very much... for a moment. Then I began to worry about what she thought of me! Well, no time like the present to find out, I thought...  I closed my book, stood up from my chair, and walked straight over to her. Then, in an uncharacteristic move, I hugged her, saying, "Hi there." And that was it. At that very instant, I felt like I had known this girl my whole life. In fact, I told her on a subsequent date,  "I met you last Tuesday... a thousand years ago."   Today is funny, really, because she hasn't fully recovered from her eye surgery, so what started as a Blind Date has lead us to a  Nearly-Blind Anniversary  a year later! But, I have to say, it's been a year filled with a lot of fun, a lot of love, and a lot of happiness. So, I'd like to dedicate today's post to her, my little  Dancer on the Sand , and to the many years I know we have ahead of us...  Here's to you and our future, honey...

      A big "Welcome!" goes out to  Calvin Klein , former member of the  Old Crew , whose return for the summer promises to breathe some of the old life back into the place... CK was actually one of the first people to train yours truly back in the days before  Mass Storage Area One  even existed (in a place aptly referred to as " the old building "). Now, he's back to ride shotgun in the  Department of Inbound Deliveries  and, more importantly, to take the lead on  Project X . More on that later...  Speaking of the Department of Inbound Deliveries... I returned after my 4-day foray into the world of home nursing to find a veritable mountain of computer cast-offs, all patiently awaiting my attention and assessment in cleverly laid-out, random piles. It was, quite literally, difficult to make heads or tails of the area. But, with a little hard work (those of you who know me personally, don't laugh) and some much appreciated help from the aforementioned CK, it's coming back together nicely after only 2 days. Do I rock, or what?

      I do believe that I have  Writer's Block ...  It's been a number of days since my last post and, despite my decision to make an entry every day, I can't come up with anything. I've been at the computer off and on a million times this weekend, checking email, playing a game or two, and reading blogs, but I haven't been able to do any writing.  Yep, it's Writer's Block...  My brain has been spinning, trying to come up with one good idea to write about. I thought about hockey, but since the Flames' lackluster performance against Detroit yesterday (they got  pounded  5 - 2), I decided to leave that alone for a while. Then, I figured I could right about my girlfriend's recent Laser Eye Surgery, but I want to wait until the recovery is over before tackling that one. And writing about my  Great Decaffeination  isn't exciting as long as nothing new has happened. I've cast my penny into the  Well of Inspiration  and heard it  clink!  against the bottom...  So, now I'm wondering about this whole Writer's Block thing... It's kinda cool, really. Just think, you're a writer and you can't come up with anything worthwhile. Well, you just say, "I've got Writer's Block" and everyone suddenly becomes very understanding and supportive. "Don't worry, it'll come", they say... Or, "Hey, don't force it, just let it happen"... What other job allows for this easy way out? Can you imagine going to your job at McDonald's one day and telling your manager that you have  Burger Block ? "That's okay, Billy, you just go sit and read the paper until you feel like flipping those All Beef Patties again." Not likely. Or how about a lifeguard with  Swimmer's Block ? "Gee, I could have saved him, but I just can't bring myself to swim today..." It's pretty obvious how well  that  would go over. No, the tolerance for not being able to do your job consistently from one day to the next is pretty low... unless you're a writer.  Hmmm... Seems I've gotten pretty far into writing a post, despite my Writer's Block... The downside is, I can't think of a clever way to end it! Is there such thing as  Finisher's Block ...?

          Hockeytown Meets Cowtown  The Calgary Flames have managed to steal  Game One  from the  Detroit Red Wings  in yet another overtime match-up. While so far lacking the intensity of the Flames-Canucks series, this one has potential...   "Calling Nurse Cuppojoe..."  Well gang, I'll be spending the rest of this week, along with the weekend, taking care of the bravest girlfriend a guy could ask for. She's just had  Laser Eye Surgery  to finally rid herself of the glasses she's been burdened with since childhood. Yep, the ol' rims got to be too much of a pain, so she traded 'em in for having a guy tape her eyelids to her eyebrows, cut and peel back her corneas, and fire a laser into her eyes. Best quote from the doctor?  "Don't worry if you smell burning flesh... That's normal."  Okay...   Move Over, Not-So-Hotmail  I, too, have just joined the ranks of  GMail  Beta users and I have one word:  Awesome . It's just like those first days of email, when we were all still amazed we could send messages around the world in the blink of an eye. With all the emails I handle at work and at home now, I thought those days of wonderment were gone for good. I should have known Google would find a way to knock my socks off again!   3 Weeks and Counting  If any of you are still keeping track (and I doubt you are), then you're aware that I've now gone without my beloved coffee for a full 21 days. That's right... My resolve is still strong. In fact, I can almost get through a day without thinking about it now. I'm noticing that I have much higher energy levels and they are more evened out, instead of spiking and dipping all the time. I figure I'll keep this up 'til I no longer see any more improvements, then I'll re-acquaint myself with the Greatest Drink on Earth.   From the Workplace   Rockstar , a long-time member of our company's  Purchase Coercion Unit  has acquired a lovely new debt for himself, which he had fashioned in the shape of a wristwatch. This should help him stand out better at the Supermarket while perusing the variety of fine Macaroni and Cheese dinners now available under his revised  Personal Budget Plan for 2004 ...

      Unbelievable! The 15-year drought is finally over! The Calgary Flames have awakened true Hockey Fever in the Stampede City once again...  It was an intense ending to an intense series. The six games leading up to last night were all about gritty, physical play and  Game 7  was no different. It was a tale of two teams... Vancouver, looking to regain the spark from earlier in the season... Calgary, desperately needing to get the monkey off their back by finally winning a playoff series... The Canucks, showing their composure under pressure as only the  "Cardiac Kids"  can... The Flames, refusing to give in to the odds-makers and settle for an early golf season...  Both teams played equally well throughout the course of the game, but Calgary managed to secure a one-goal lead coming into the final minutes of regulation time. Then, an undisciplined penalty in front of the Calgary net put Vancouver Canuck  Ed Jovanovski  into the penalty box... Vancouver pulled their goalie in favor of the extra attacker... Calgary's tight defense caused a turn-over at the Calgary blue line... With 20 seconds left in the game,  Jarome Iginla  raced for the empty net, checked by the Vancouver defense... A weak shot that grazed the outside of the post... No worries, the clock was ticking down and Calgary could feel the victory coming. I was literally on the edge of my seat. And then the world turned upside down.  Vancouver regained possession of the puck and made a dash for Calgary territory. Iginla, back checking, had his stick knocked from his hands and, in very uncharacteristic fashion, tripped over it and fell. The Canucks charged into the zone and, with only 5.7 seconds remaining, managed to slide the equalizer past  Miika Kiprusoff .  Heartbreak... Anger... Disappointment... Betrayal...  I went through the entire range of emotions as I watched that puck cross the line. In fact, I vowed that I would  never  again cheer for the Calgary Flames if they lost that game. I know, that makes me a fairweather fan, but let's face it, 15 years of letdown is hard to overcome!  Amazingly, Calgary began the overtime period with lots of jump and made good use of the remaining penalty minutes given to Jovanovski. This city erupted in celebration as  Martin Gelinas  put away the game winner in only 1 minute and 25 seconds.  So, the Flames advance to meet the mighty  Detroit Red Wings  and it's the Canucks who will be swinging their golf clubs in frustration... The Band wagon rolls on...

       A Look at the Inside   Borrowing a page from the infamous " urlLink  Call Centre Confidential  ", I have decided to use this space to occasionally recount the adventures I endure day-in and day-out at a computer remanufacturing centre. So, without further ado:   Chapter One: Enter the Newlings   As the weekend draws to a close, I can't help but wonder what tomorrow will bring... The  Powers That Be  have finally decided that the manpower shortage in  Mass Storage Area One  has gone on long enough, what with one man (yours truly) handling  Incoming , another tending to  Outgoing , and 2 incapacitated  Labourers  (there's another story there, I assure you).   So, for the first time in many months, the company coffers are being pried open and we're going to be seeing fresh blood in the ranks. Yes sir, they've gone over the resumes, held the interviews, and made the callbacks. What we have now are qualified individuals, highly experienced in their fields, and ready to help the team. All that remains is to make them forget everything they know and show them how to do it all our way...  Tomorrow will be interesting, indeed.

       Disappointment... For now.   Well, it certainly was a nail-biter... Vancouver came on so strong that I thought maybe the Flames forgot to show up for the game. By the middle of the second period, the Canucks had Calgary on the ropes with a 4-0 lead. I couldn't believe it. All the old feelings of frustration watching the Flames miss the playoffs came back like evil deja vu. During a commercial, I went to tell my girlfriend that the Flames of old had returned. I was sure there was no way for Calgary to come back.  Yet, comeback they did... with a vengeance. Coach  Darryl Sutter  called a timeout after the fourth unanswered goal to get his guys settled down. After that, Calgary went on a tear. Four unanswered goals of their own later, we went into overtime. And, at long last, the refs decided to put away their whistles and really let them grind it out. Back and forth, chance after chance, one a amazing stop after another. I was literally vibrating from the stress!  Then, the other shoe fell... It took a little over 2 overtime periods for it to happen, but Vancouver scored. Calgary lost a battle for the puck down low that let Canuck  Brendan Morrison  walk out in front and slide the puck past Flame goalie  Miika Kiprusoff . A game that started at 8:00pm with the Flames looking to eliminate the Canucks finally ended at 12:35am with Calgary and Vancouver looking forward to  Game 7  on Monday night.  I'm exhausted... That game really took a round out of me. I'm off to bed now, but you can be sure there will be more overtime periods in Dreamland.

       Holding my breath...   There is only an hour left until Game Time, and this whole city is on edge... The Calgary Flames are heading into Game 6 with a 3-2 lead over Vancouver and could very well win their first playoff series since they won the Stanley Cup 15 years ago. Get ready for a night filled with face-paced, hard-checking hockey, and all the beer and herbicide commercials that go along with it.  I can already feel the adrenaline starting to surge through my veins. Who needs coffee at a time like this?  I apologize to those of you out there who don't follow hockey... As long as the Flames run for the Cup stays alive, I'm going to be spending my nights watching the games and my days talking about them. Like I've said before, I  love  this sport... I can watch  any  two teams go at it, just for the sake of seeing the game played. But now, with the added excitement of having my hometown team in the thick of it, well... I'm practically a man obsessed. So, forgive me if this blog becomes nothing more than a wordy " Go Flames Go! " from time to time... But it's been such a long time and I don't know when we'll see it again!  That's it for now, folks... I have to track down some beers, maybe a bowl of chips and get ready for what I hope will be the noisiest night Calgary has seen since 1989.

       Way Back When...   I caught myself doing it again... Here I am, listening to music at work (ah, the luxuries, eh?) and suddenly " Rock This Town " by the  Stray Cats  comes on. Instantly, I'm catapulted back 21 years into the past...  It was a time of Rugby Pants and T-Shirts with glittery iron-on decals. A time when I could get out of bed, smooth down the parts of my hair that were standing at attention, and go off to school. A time when said school was still in the same neighborhood as my house, so Mom could force me to walk there, regardless of the blizzard raging outside.  And, it was Grade 6... That final year of Elementary when you are the kings and queens of the school, the fear of going to Junior High and being nothing but a peon again still distant enough to ignore. The  Commodore VIC 20  was enjoying the distinction of being one of the most popular  Home Computers  (with color! Eat your heart out  Apple ...) and we never missed an episode of  The Dukes of Hazzard .  I can still picture the inside of the library at  Terrace Road Elementary  the day of my Grade 6 "graduation"... 20 boys and girls bragging about where they would be going for summer vacation and showing off their photocopied certificates of achievement... Big Tupperware bowls filled with chips and cheezies... Styrofoam cups and 1 litre  glass  bottles of Coke and 7-Up... A stack of LP's (that's right, good old  vinyl  records) to dance to... Where was I going with this? Oh yeah! Stray Cats...  So, it turned out that "Rock This Town" was one of the most popular songs played that day, along with " Thriller " by  Michael Jackson  (who wasn't nearly so white back then). And who was the cool kid who brought the Stray Cats to the dance? Well, that would be yours truly. Unfortunately, that's all there is to this little trip down memory lane. Nothing really exciting happened... It wasn't a defining moment in my social development... No, it's just the image that pops into my head when I hear those rock-a-billy sounds.  I tried to share this experience with my co-worker, the guy I share an office with. He just turned around in his chair and said, "Yeah, I   think   I was born then..." Well, now that I know he thinks I'm old, I guess I won't bother telling him that today is my birthday... Nah, I'll just smile and go back to listening to my tunes. Hey! " She Blinded Me With Science "! Cool!    P.S. My humblest apologies for the shameless way I slipped my birthday into the blog. I promise not to let it happen again for at least a year...

       Two Minute Penalty for Boring the Fans   Today's blog will have to be a rant, but I promise to keep it short for you...  At this very moment, the Flames and Canucks have just retired to their dressing rooms for the first intermission of Game 4. The Canucks (as I pointed out yesterday) are leading the series 2 games to 1, but the score for this game is still tied at zero. Lots of great skating, awesome passes, and amazing goaltending... But here's the problem:  The NHL Officials .  Ever since the playoffs began, all we've heard from the color commentators is how the referees have been instructed by their organization to crack down on  "obstructions"  in the game. These are instances where a player does something (tripping, hooking, interference) to illegally interfere with an opposing player's progress. So, what we have now are a bunch of guys in striped shirts who are too paranoid to miss a call (one can only  imagine  what punishment they've been threatened with) so they call anything that even  resembles  an obstruction. It's getting right out of hand! I'm not sure about the rest of the fans out there, but I know that I tuned into watch the finest that the NHL has to offer, not the  Best and the Brightest of the Whistle Blowers . You wanna talk about obstructions? How about stopping the game every 2 minutes for pointless penalties?  In my opinon, these playoffs would be a  lot  more entertaining if we could just get back to some good old 5-on-5...

       This Just In...   Okay, just a quick update today... I've got a million things on my mind, but not an ounce of desire to put them into fancy prose. So, hold onto your hats because here we go!  First of all, for those of you wondering how my  Great Decaffeination  went, I am happy to report that I not only made it through the seven days, but today marks my  11th  day without coffee. Actually, I haven't had tea or cola either... I thought those might be considered cheating. Anyway, it looks as if I'm going to try for a full two-weeks with this little java-free gig. Kinda makes the name of this blog a little inappropriate...  And there is great rejoicing in the land! The  NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs  are in full swing! The hiss of sharpened blades on white ice... The crack of wood meeting frozen rubber... The lights... The horns... This is the time of year that every Canadian lives for! I'm once again glued to the TV every night as teams battle for hockey's ultimate prize. And this year is a little sweeter still... For the first time in 8 years, the  Calgary Flames  (my home team) have made it to the post-season! Now, all of us fair-weather fans who have been avoiding them for the better part of a disappointing decade are back on the band wagon, baby! Windows are filled with " Go Flames Go! " signs,  Flaming C  flags are flying from the tops of cars, and the  Saddledome  (our appropriately named arena) is packed to the rafters.  However, I am a little worried... The Flames are trailing the  Vancouver Canucks  2 games to 1 in this opening 7 game series so far. Usually not much to worry about with a team as hot as the Flames have been of late, but a couple strange things happened on the weekend that have me doubting... First, I was watching the sports highlights and they were talking about the Flames. All of a sudden, the picture changed to a shot of a couple guys competing in the  Master's at Augusta  (golf). It lasted all of a second, most likely someone setting up the tape for the next story, but I saw it. Now, for those of you who don't know, it is often said when a hockey team is eliminated from the playoffs that they are " gone golfing ". Eerie... Later, I was watching a documentary about the explosion of the  Mont Blanc in Halifax Harbour  in 1917. The narrator was telling about the families out for a stroll that day that never knew what hit them, and they showed a stock-clip of some families out for a walk. Now, for some reason, this particular clip was modern, not set in the period as every other one was. Again, it was only on the screen briefly, but a little boy walking at the front of the soon-to-be-dead oblivious people was wearing a Calgary Flames sweatshirt! Spooky... You know what they say: If it sounds like an omen and feels like an omen...  In other news... I have been checking out my regularly read blogs, well, regularly, and I've noticed a drop in the frequency of posts on most of them (though there are a few exceptions). It got me to thinking that I don't sit down at the old  Blogger  nearly often enough, so... Even though I am a firm believer that one should stay silent when one has nothing good to say, I'm going to make an attempt to get on here once a day for the next little while. I may not have anything of great entertainment to share, but I figure I can at least come up with a two- or three-sentence thought for the day, right? Well, we'll see how it goes.  Well, I'm off for now... Gonna go grab a beer and settle in for some hockey.

       Day Four   Today is  Day Four . It has been four days since I made a life-altering decision. This is the fourth day that I have gone without coffee. This is the first day that I've been able to talk about it...  It began last Thursday.  My girlfriend came by to pick me up from work, as usual. I was exhausted from a long day of trying to look busy, as usual. Untold milligrams of caffeine from uncounted cups of coffee were coursing through my veins, as usual. We kissed and then proceeded on our way, my knee bouncing triple-time to whatever song was on the radio, as usual.  After the typical, "How was your day?", "Good. And yours?", "Fine.", she got to telling me that she had been talking to her Mom. Now,  that  conversation opener never ceases to send a shiver down my spine. As a man, you have to perk up, pay attention, and be ready to defend yourself, or defend your mate, depending where the damage has been inflicted. So, steeling myself for the worst, I put on my most casual smile (knee now bouncing wildly out of control) and said, "Really? What's up?" She took my hand the way you would if you had to tell someone that their dog has died and said, "She thinks you're addicted to coffee."  Well blow me down! What a revelation! I almost burst out laughing... What was the first clue? The 7 or 8 trips to the coffee maker a day? The pile of empty Tim Horton's cups on my desk? My constant state of vibration? Or maybe that " I haven't slept in 3 days " look in my eyes? Of course I'm addicted to coffee!  Everybody  knows  that ! I've been going hardcore with the ol' java juice since I was 16... Drinking it black since I was 21... That's 17 years of serious Joe Time!  Okay, in all fairness, she's a sweet lady and she's only just gotten to know me in the last few months, so I shouldn't be  too  sarcastic. In fact, it turns out that it  was  the " I haven't slept in 3 days " look in my eyes that tipped her off. Apparently, she was a big coffee-addict in her day, so she knows the signs, and she had to give it up under doctor's orders. I knew there was a reason I don't like doctors...  Well, I've been told many a time before that I should drink less coffee, but I never listened. Why should I? It wakes me up in the morning, it gets me through my tedious workday, it's the perfect social drink, and it keeps my point of view just enough off-center to keep me amused. It's a vice, but one I've accepted with open arms. Still, I got to thinking... If someone who doesn't really know me can tell by  looking  at me that I'm a coffee junkie, maybe it's time to cut back a little... or a lot.  So, I've decided to do a little  de-tox  routine. I decided to give coffee up completely for one week. Seven days without my crutch. Drink lots of water, flush out the system, and start fresh. This is Day Four... Here's what you've missed:   Day One : Woke up fine, as usual, and went to work where I promptly began falling asleep. I yawned more times that day than I think I ever have in an 8 hour period. My brain felt foggy, the day seemed to last an eternity, and the headaches began. My favorite part? That would have to be my encouraging co-workers. The ones who laughed and kept offering to get me a coffee. Ah, my support group.   Day Two : If you've been keeping track, you'll know this was Saturday. The headaches came on with a vengeance, as did my bitchiness. I think I have been given a glimpse into the world of  PMS  and  Nic Fits  (my apologies to all my smoker friends who I've teased over the years as they've tried to quit). Everything annoyed me. Sound annoyed me. Silence annoyed me. Newton's Third Law of Physics pissed me off (and I've always been rather fond of that one). Even being annoyed at everything was getting on my nerves. My family began referring to me as  He Who Should Be Avoided .   Day Three : Awoke after a restless night of back aches and leg cramps. It was a day spent alternating between vegging out to movies, arguing with my girlfriend over nothing, and soaking in hot baths. The pain settled somewhere in my hips (man, I sound like a woman) and didn't go away until I took a heavy dose of Motrin and Tylenol. By this point, even my loving girlfriend was urging me to have a cup...  And today is  Day Four . Surprisingly, the headaches have become little more than mild sinus pressure (child's play), and my mood is greatly improved. Of course, being a Monday, I was back at work and surrounded by people carrying all forms of take-out cups, travel mugs, and coffee cups. Each time I was forced to walk past the coffee maker was a true test of my will. But, with many trips to the water fountain and keeping myself occupied with work (it's amazing how fast the day passes when you actually do something...), I was able to stick to my resolve.  I'll try to keep you updated on my progress. Of course, if I never write another word on this topic again, I think you'll all understand and never mention it, right?

      The game has been over for less than 2 minutes, but I'm already sure that we're going to be hearing the same old garbage from the Tampa Bay Lightning Head Coach,  John Tortorella . He's going to say that his team got back on their feet and played hard against the Calgary Flames, who's presence in the Stanley Cup Finals, in his opinion, is a total fluke. We're going to have to endure his chest-puffing, swagger-stepping, egotism for another 3 days until  Game 4 . Well, John, let me point out a couple things...   First of all, if Referee  Kerry Fraser  would pay as close attention to the game as he does to his sadly out-of-style hair-do, the Lightning would never have gotten the 2-man advantage that led to their goal. Somebody grab that guy a rule book and a hairstyle magazine!  Secondly, you'll notice that the only goal scored was on that 2-man advantage. Calgary was playing a hard-hitting game, they had lots of jump, and they won a lot of key puck-battles. But let only 3 of them face a full compliment of 5 for 2 minutes... What do you expect?  The Flames clearly had more scoring chances than the Lightning tonight, but were unable to solve the  Bulin Wall  that is  Nikolai Kabibulin . Admittedly, the goalie was sharp tonight... Perhaps just a little too sharp for Calgary. On a number of occasions, he was hung out to dry by his slow-footed defensive team, but still managed to keep his net clear.  All in all, it was a good game, and a fun one to watch (minus the questionable officiating, mind you), and the 1 - 0 score reflects that. The two teams really took it to each other and gave it their all, despite what we're sure to hear from the Tampa Coach.  It's going to be a tough night back in Tampa this Thursday night as the Calgary Flames look to regain their lead in the series. If they manage to go up 3 games to 2, then we'll be seeing them play for the ultimate prize here again Saturday night... One can only imagine how wild the   urlLink Red Mile   will be then!  Oh, and before I go, a final word for Mr. Tortorella... Your boys played hard and got the 1 goal victory tonight, but don't forget the 3 - 0  Shut Up , er,  Shut Out  that was handed to you the last time you fired off your mouth...   Go Flames Go!!!

      Wow... Can you believe it? It's been  forever  since I posted anything new. Well, as you will soon see, there has been a good reason for that. Read on...  So, things at the old warehouse have been a lot more hectic than usual lately. I guess that's what happens when you have 50% of the staff you need. Anyway, CK and I have been thrown into a bunch of  "new roles"  over the past two weeks, in a last ditch effort to avoid total disaster. First and foremost, as I've already mentioned in a previous post, we are the  Kings of Unboxing  and the  Regents of Re-Boxing  (please allow us to take a bow). Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is obvious for all to see that we alone possess the unparalleled skills necessary to get this job done... Over  800 systems  have passed through our hands, not once but  twice  in the last two weeks! Impressive indeed, I know. And the  Ones in the Higher Places  know it as well. Having noticed our unmistakable abilities, they have promised another 800 within the week! Oh well, I guess that's why I get paid the  Big Bucks  and CK gets paid the  Not-Quite-So-Big-But-Bigger-Than-Before Bucks ...  Naturally, such monotonous and mundane work has had an effect on the two of us. Forget about the tired state we are left in everyday... Forget that my 4-year old can stay awake later than me now... Forget that muscles I never knew I  had  are in pain... The worst part of it all has to be the  Gradual Insanity !  In the first two days, we must have exhausted every interesting story we could think of. Since then, we've had to fill the time in more creative ways... Ever played  "Name That Tune"  in a warehouse? How about a rousing game of  "How Far Can You Throw  This " ? Yeah, I didn't think so... However, I  did  learn about something very cool during all this. It has to do with a bunch of guys CK knows, and the crazy things they do with cameras... I could try to tell you about it, but I couldn't possibly do it justice. Instead, I'll tell you that it's called  "One Leggin'"  and you can learn more about it  urlLink here . We've had a blast discussing various "One Leggin'" venues and challenges... Like I said, I blame it on the Gradual Insanity...  Perhaps in an effort to ease the pressure on our psyches, the company has also been sending us on little expeditions outside the warehouse from time to time. We call these  "pickups" . Now, "pickups" are normally done by the  "Pickup Guy" , and it entails  picking up  product (ie. ancient PC's that haven't seen the light of day since the last century) purchased by the company to refurbish, then sell, scrap, or store forever. Unfortunately, the "Pickup Guy" is apparently out for the season with an injury, so we've been called in to cover the gap. Yay for us. Nothing like lifting and packing old, obsolete machines to make you forget about the pain of lifting and packing newer, more useful machines...  Now, don't forget, CK and I both have  actual jobs  to do in the warehouse, aside from the fun mentioned above. As you can assume, they aren't exactly getting the attention they deserve, and it's only a matter of time before that catches up with us! Isn't life just grand?  Well, I guess that about does it for now... I still haven't caught up on the sleep I need to carry on at this pace, but I do have my laundry done before midnight, for once, so I think I'll crash now. Hopefully, I'll be able to get back on soon and regale you with  Tales of the Mighty Calgary Flames  and their  Slaying of the Lowly Tampa Bay Lightning  in their  Quest for the Stanley Cup ... Stay tuned, folks!

      I can't remember the last time I was this tired...  First of all, things at the old warehouse haven't been exciting enough to bother with a  "Scenes from the Forklift"  post, but they have been busy. I've spent the entire week, along with the help of  CK , unboxing, prepping, and reboxing over 800 pieces of high-end inventory. Not exactly what you'd call  "brain work" , but very physically taxing.  That would normally be enough to have me craving a weekend, but that's far from where it ends... Last night,  Rockstar  invited my girlfriend and me over to his apartment to watch Game 6 of the  Western Conference Final  between the Calgary Flames and the San Jose Sharks. The lure of his super-wide screen TV and the promise of a steak dinner proved to be more than I could resist. Now, as I've  urlLink mentioned before , Rockstar lives just off the now infamous  17th Ave  here in Calgary so it was quite a rush to experience the pandemonium at  Ground Zero  when the Flames eliminated the Sharks from the playoffs around 10pm. People were dancing in the streets, cars were honking non-stop, balconies for blocks were packed with elated fans, and the flame burned bright atop the  urlLink  Calgary Tower  .  After standing on Rockstar's balcony for a while, enjoying a little celebratory Champagne, the effects of the last few days plus the adrenaline rush of knowing the Flames would be playing for the  Stanley Cup  began to take their toll... I was in need of some serious sleep and a weekend! But it wasn't over yet...  Three of us had tickets to see  urlLink  Thornley   play at a bar called  "The Whiskey" , a bar which is quite close to the Saddledome. So, we put away the Champagne glasses, grabbed our coats, and made our way to the gig. We drove through crowds of people, literally thousands of party-goers chanting  "Go Flames Go!"  or honking their horns. It was an amazing sight to behold.  We arrived at the bar shortly before 11pm with just enough time to grab a drink before Thornley took the stage. They played for about an hour, crushing our eardrums with their fast-paced rock. All in all, it was a good show, but the fatigue was starting to take  serious  effect. By the time we arrived home again, discarded our smoke-filled clothes and finally crawled between the sheets, it was a little after 1:30 in the morning. Believe me, it seemed like mere  seconds  before my alarm woke me again at 6!  And, I was back at by 8 this morning... Repeating the same unbox, prep, rebox routine with CK that we'd been doing all week. There wasn't enough coffee in the world to keep me from yawning every two minutes... But, I guess I made it through, or you wouldn't be reading this. I just can't believe it's only Thursday and I have to do it all again tomorrow!  I'm getting too old for this...

       Light 'Em Up!  As I sit down to write this, the horns are still honking up and down the street to celebrate the latest Flames victory over the Sharks. Despite a dismal and depressing "performance" at the Saddledome for Games 3 and 4, Calgary has bounced back with a vengeance to secure a 3-2 lead in the series and the chance to send the Sharks packing as early as Wednesday night.   Extreme Makeover: Blog Edition  You can't help but notice the changes  "Musings..."  has undergone in the past few days... Thanks to the recent improvements in  urlLink  Blogger  , I was inspired to adopt a whole new look and feel for the page, along with a little info about myself. I wasn't too sure about the picture, though... I thought it might make it seem too much like a Personals ad and, although that  is  how I met my girlfriend, I have no further interest in  those  kind of hits! Also, I'm afraid I had to ditch all of the comments left over the past few months, since I opted to use  Blogger's  Comments feature instead of the old  Haloscan . Anyway, browse around and feel free to let me know what you think. Especially check out my  urlLink  BlogRoll   if you have the time...   Drool On My Pillow  I had a  very  strange dream in the wee hours of the morning today. I dreamt that I was out shopping with a bunch of people, some that I know, one that I know but never hang out with, and at least one celebrity, though I can't remember who now. Anyway, as we were about to leave the store, I decided I wanted a pack of gum and began searching those little racks of candy and chocolate bars they usually have right beside the cashiers. My eyes landed on a  huge  pack of  urlLink  Bubblicious   in a yellow package with red and orange lettering... The flavor was  "Strawberry Orgy Coffee Bean" . I couldn't believe my luck! Another caffeinated gum! I ran out of the store to show my friends, thinking all along that I couldn't wait to write a blog about my find. So, what is more disturbing? My obsession with caffeine, my obsession with blogging, or the use of the word  "orgy"  on a food product???

       I've noticed a very interesting trend over the past few days with the hits I'm receiving here at  "Musings..."  It seems that a large number of people are using  Google  (and other search engines) to find pages relating to  "Calgary Flames 17th Ave girls gone wild" . Now, I know that I've been writing about the Flames a lot of late, and I'm sure I've mentioned the celebrations that occur along 17th Ave on game nights... Hey, it's likely that I've even used the words "girls", "gone", and "wild" at some point. So, it's no mystery  how  people are being directed to my page... My question is,   "Why?"    Now, I'm not going to play innocent here... I realize that people want to see pictures of girls on 17th Ave "going wild" with the current success of the Calgary Flames. Perhaps there is some sort of  Mardi Gras -esque atmosphere down there these days with all the breast-baring that implies. In fact, I can think of nothing else that would inspire people to set out on such web searches as mentioned above. But, you'd think that, since I'm from Calgary, and I'm right in the midst of all the Flames hype,   I   would have heard of this by now! But I haven't... Not really. I  did  mention these bizarre Google referrals to Rockstar yesterday, and he mentioned something about bare breasts... Come to think of it, he lives just off 17th Ave... Hmm...  Oh well, it's neither here nor there, really. Just an odd observation on my part, I guess. I would, however, like to say the following to those of you who have found yourself here by accident:  Thanks for dropping in... Sorry I couldn't give you what you were looking for... But, once you're "finished" with that  other  obsession, why not pop back in and take a look around? You never know, you just might like it!

      I have just discovered the coolest thing! Are you ready for this? No, seriously... Are you  ready ? This could well be the greatest thing since sliced bread... And let's face it, sliced bread is pretty damn cool.  I have discovered...  Drum roll, please ... Caffeinated mints and caffeinated gum! Is that  awesome , or what?!? As if it weren't enough already that this planet is blessed by the goodness of coffee, now I can get my fix in a little candy or simply chew my way to jittery bliss!   Rockstar  (you'll remember him from   urlLink Scenes from the Forklift  ) turned me on to this incredible line of products from   urlLink Penguin  . It turns out that one of his clients also markets some of these wonderful goodies here in Canada. Talk about my lucky break! In truth, I have only tried the  Cinnamon Mints , but I have serious plans to get my hands on the  Chocolate Mints , the  Peppermints , and every flavor of  Energy Gum  I can... Thank goodness the   urlLink Great Decaffeination   is over, eh?  Once I've had the chance to sample the full range that Penguin has to offer (and as soon as I can see straight enough to type again), I promise to post a full review for you to check out...

      Not since Game 2 against Vancouver in the first round of the playoffs had Calgary scored a First Period goal... Going into the Western Conference Final against San Jose, that was  11 games . That brutal streak was broken, however, in the first game against the Sharks, with the Flames grabbing a 2 goal lead in the first. San Jose struggled back, though, and ultimately sent the game to Overtime by flipping the puck past Miika Kiprusoff in the dying minutes of the Third Period. Undaunted, the Calgary Flames continued to battle hard for the puck. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, defenseman  Steve Montador  appeared high in the slot, received a sweet pass from Flames Captain Jarome Iginla, and buried the puck stick-side on the Shark goalie. The Calgary Flames had stolen Home Ice Advantage from San Jose, and found themselves with a 1-0 lead in the series.   Everybody knew that Game 2 was a critical one. If the Flames could manage to win, they would effectively have a strangle-hold on the Sharks, bringing a 2-0 lead back to Home Ice. And it didn't take long for them to prove they have what it takes... A mere  20 seconds  into the game, Calgary Flame  Marcus Nilson  let the puck fly toward the Shark's net, only to see it  "pinball"  off a leg, then a skate, and slide past the goalie! With less than half a minute played, the wind had come out of the Shark's sails, but the storm kept coming. Calgary continued to pressure, putting the puck past Shark netminder  Evgeni Nabokov  3 more times to win the game by a score of 4-1. It was only the second time the Shark's have lost a game in Regulation Time these playoffs.  Tomorrow night, the mayhem begins at the Saddledome... The next two games will be played on Calgary Home Ice, and the fans are hungry for victory. If the Flames continue to play as hard as they have been, we could be seeing them advance to the  Stanley Cup Finals  as early as this Sunday!   Go Flames Go!!!

      I've gone and done it again...  Even though my days of bachelorhood are behind me, bits and pieces of the old lifestyle still manage to cling to me more tenaciously than cat hair on a pair of black pants. Even though I had the entire weekend to get it done, my laundry basket still sits in the corner of the bathroom like some multi-colored volcano photographed in mid-eruption.   I can't ignore it any longer. Not only is it clashing terribly with the girlfriend's  Guest Towels  and  Fancy Soaps , but I've completely run out of clothes for work! Sure, working in a warehouse means I don't have to don the old  Suit and Tie  everyday, but I'm not too eager to relive past nightmares by showing up wearing only a pair of boxers... Or was it briefs? Either way, if I don't get some laundry done tonight, I'll be forced to wear my  "nice pants"  (the ones my girlfriend bought me) and my faded  "Hard Rock Cafe: Los Angeles"  T-Shirt. The shirt should have been thrown out long ago, but men don't throw away clothes... That would be like abandoning a car on the side of the road... You just don't do it! As for the "nice pants", if I recall correctly, I believe I signed some sort of contract that forbids them being within 3 kilometers of the warehouse. So, laundry time it is...  Now, I  could  grab that laundry basket, separate the clothes into clever little piles like "colors", "darks", and "whites", but like I said, there are some parts of the bachelor lifestyle that never go away. If it wasn't already 11:30 at night, I'd probably just grab everything that wasn't  "white-ish"  and cram it into the machine (I find a broomstick is especially handy for "tamping" the articles into place), double the soap dosage, and let the Warm Wash / Cold Rinse cycle do its thing. Next, a nice full load of "white-ish" on Hot Wash / Cold Rinse and we're almost done. All that would remain is to stuff the freshly "washed" loads back into the laundry basket, where they would sit for a week until no iron on Earth could get the wrinkles out. But I haven't got time for  that  tried and true method...  Instead, I'll have to pick through the piles, find exactly what I want to wear tomorrow, and wash it, regardless of color. This is also a common method of mine, which probably goes a long way toward explaining my use of the word "white-ish"...  Anyway, then I'll have to sit up, probably posting something terribly boring to my blog like,  "Men and Their Laundry"  while I wait for the wash to finish. Once it goes in the dryer, I'm home free and can get back to the peaceful sleep I was enjoying before I was startled awake by the realization that I had no clothes to wear.  Here I go again...

      Whoa! I take a break from the old  Blog Scene  for a weekend, and everything changes on me!  I arrived at work this morning, popped on my  urlLink Trillian  (aka MSN Messenger and a whole lot more), and saw that I had a message from my good buddy  urlLink Torfeida . "How do you like the new Blogger?" he asked. What? New Blogger? Whatever could he be talking about?  So, having 20 minutes or so to kill before starting my day, I surfed on over to  urlLink Blogger  to see what was up. Low and behold! It was different! In fact, quite a bit different... New layout, new color scheme, something called the  "Dashboard"  from which I can manage my blog... Impressive, to say the least!  Now, I guess I'm going to have to get back into the swing of things and post a couple blogs...  You know, it's funny how guilty I can feel if I let it go for a few days. Kinda like I'm letting people down by not having anything new for them to read (isn't  that  presumptuous of me!). Personally, whenever I go  Blog Surfing  and find that my favorite reads haven't changed since the last time I was there, I feel disappointed... It's the same feeling I get if I tune in to catch a show, only to find out that it's a re-run. And if that sort of thing starts happening more and more often, I'm likely to give up trying after a while. Since I'm sure most of you are the same, I better get crackin'!  Well, keep your eyes open for more  "Scenes from the Forklift"  and the usual  Calgary Flames Updates  (they are leading 1-0 in the Western Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks, by the way), and whatever else crosses my mind. Until then...

       Unbelievable! A true  Cinderella Story ... The Calgary Flames have managed to eliminate the Detroit Red Wings, the team that finished first place over all in the National Hockey League this year, and a damned skilled team to boot! Yes folks, Hockeytown has gone down in flames...  It was incredible enough when Calgary made in past the first round of the playoffs, sending the Vancouver Canucks to the golf course... The city has gone wild with an excitement it hadn't felt in 15 years. People everywhere are suddenly rooting for the home town boys once again... Bars are packed on game nights... You can't go anywhere without seeing a Flames Jersey, a "Go Flames Go" sign, or a Flaming C flag... And with last night's victory securing a place in the third round, the Conference Final, it's just going to get crazier!  Not long after  Martin Gelinas  ended Detroit's season in the final minute of the first overtime period of Game 6, the fans began pouring out of the Saddledome and bombarding the local area bars and restaurants to celebrate. An estimated 10,000 people (half the capacity of the arena) flooded down  17th Ave , the trendy night-spot strip just west of the 'Dome, causing the police to eventually shut the street down. People were dancing in the back of pickup trucks, running through the streets in their underwear (admittedly, a strange way to show support for the team...), and generally partying like it was  Y2K  all over again. Throughout the rest of the city, cars were honking their horns in victory well past 3am.   Encouragingly, local law enforcement reported this morning that, despite the carrying-on, the cheering fans behaved rather well, and there were no arrests made... Not bad when you consider the aforementioned 10,000 people packed into a couple square miles filled with alcohol!  And so, we now await the beginning of the Conference Final against the  San Jose Sharks ... Our boys have a few days to rest and heal before throwing themselves into the  "Shark Tank" , and this city has a chance to recover from last night's celebration. And, if this is how we react to making past round two, what will happen if we actually make it to the  Stanley Cup Finals ? One can only imagine...

      For the first time in 30 days, I have experienced the  "sunrise in my bloodstream" . That's right, my Coffee Abstinence is finally over.  Being a rather warm, if overcast, Sunday morning, I decided to take my daughter for a little walk around the neighborhood after breakfast. We put on our sneakers and Spring jackets and set off, hand in hand, to do a little exploring. If you haven't taken a walk with a 4-year old, I highly recommend it. It's surprising what their little eyes see and what their little minds make of it all... Something as simple as a robin hopping around on the neighbor's lawn becomes a significant event.  I decided that the first stop on our little tour would be the corner convenience store. I knew before I even went inside that today would be my big day. So, I led my little girl to the Candy Aisle first, to let her pick out a little treat. The expression  "like a kid in a candy shoppe"  still rings true today, as she seemed to take forever pondering over the wide range of powders, lollipops, and other assorted confections. With a little help, she eventually settled on a necklace of candy beads and a package of Bottlecaps (these having been a favorite of mine in years gone by).   Then, it was off to the  Coffee Counter . Remember my "kid in a candy shoppe" comment? Well, it seems that it holds true for us "older kids" as well. Before me was displayed a variety of decanters offering everything from a  "Breakfast Brew"  to  "Columbian" , from  "Irish Cream"  to  "Medium Dark Roast" , all touted as  "Seattle's Best" . Well, if it's good enough for the birthplace of Starbuck's, how could I go wrong? I grabbed a nice big 20 oz. cup and filled it to the brim with "Columbian".  Upon leaving the store, it was back to our little trek, she happily consuming tiny, sugary bead after tiny, sugary bead, myself savoring every sip of my first coffee in a month.   By and by, we found ourselves at the neighborhood Elementary School. Even here, the support for the  Calgary Flames  was evident. The professionally printed signs in the front windows of homes around town and the  Flaming C  flags festooning many of the city's cars and trucks are one thing... To see the logo recreated by a bunch of Kindergarten children, though, is truly inspiring!  After playing at the park for a little while, climbing on monkey bars and seeing how high we can jump from, we headed back home, just in time for a little bit of lunch. All in all, it was a great morning.  Oh... How was the coffee, you're wondering? First of all, it tasted  fantastic ! And it only seemed to get better with each sip... As for the effect it had on me? Well, it wasn't the great caffeine rush that I was expecting after such a long drought, but it  did  put a little spring in my step... And I can't remember the last time a blog post flew off my fingers so quickly!  Here's to coffee!

      All in all, it was a good week for  Mass Storage Area One  in general and for the  Department of Inbound Deliveries  in particular. In fact, by early Friday morning, Inbound was fully caught up on all duties and responsibilities, an event which I can assure you hasn't happened in quite some time! Of course, as mentioned before, the addition of  CK  and  Newbie  to the place has helped. But since Newbie missed Wednesday and CK wasn't scheduled for Thursday or Friday...  Friday's Big Task was to get ready for  Project X . CK will need a Base of Operations from which to oversee this endeavor, so I set out to establish this for him, with the help of Newbie and our  IT Guy . Naturally, the perfect spot happened to be occupied by countless tons of steel which nobody wanted to claim ownership of and really has no relevant purpose in the process of refurbishing computers. Never the less, as with most things in MSA One, I couldn't throw it out so the bulk of the day was spent relocating it.  Once the area was clear, all that remained was to install a command console. Normally, quite a simple task... However, as IT Guy pointed out to me, there was no existing connection to our network available in this particular location. And so, more of the day was spent fumbling around in the ceiling space between the Server Room and Project X HQ. I had forgotten how much I hate Fiberglas insulation, by the way...  In the end, it all came together nicely. CK will be able to take the Command Chair in Project X HQ first thing Monday morning. And, speaking of Monday morning, rumor has it that  another  of the  Old Crew  will be rejoining us. This is starting to feel like a Back to the Future sequel...

      This story doesn't actually belong to me, but it's one of the best I have, and the topic has come up recently in my comments...  The year was 1981. I had just moved from my Mom's place to my Dad's. Luckily, they were divorced or this would have been a very weird scenario! Anyway, in the move, most of my toys were left behind for my two younger brothers,  J  and  M . Among these many cool and fascinating things was my collection of " urlLink dinky cars ". And thus begins our story...   The curtain rises on J and M, happily playing with their cars in the alley behind their home. I should point out that the cars they played with were a mix of the ones I left behind and whatever vehicles the two of them already owned. In short, enough to keep them occupied for hours. Also, this particular back alley was the dirt and gravel type that lend themselves so well to the construction of miniature roads, parking lots, and  impound yards. And so, the two young boys were making the most of their day cruising around their tiny  Automotive Utopia .  As mothers usually do, ours called J and M in as the day drew to a close. Now, since it was the middle of Summer, they just knew they'd be playing outside again the next day, so they couldn't see the logic in packing up all the cars and bringing them in. Why, they'd just have to bring them out again! Talk about inefficient! But how could they be left outside without creating too much of a temptation for the other neighborhood children? It was then that J had a brainstorm... They could bury them!  And so, before Mom could call again and threaten a grounding that would last until the next school year, the boys dutifully consecrated the dinky cars to their temporary graves for the night.  The next day dawned bright and sunny. The boys jumped out of bed, wolfed down their breakfast of generic-brand cornflakes and powdered milk, and set off to resume their play of the day before. However, as they approached the back alley, their hearts sank and they knew they would never see their precious little cars again...  The alley had been  paved .  At some point in the morning, before J and M had risen, a City Crew had come and added a new, pristine asphalt hard-top to the previously gravelled back lane! What are the odds?!? Now, the collection of cars, trucks, and various other vehicles would be forever enshrined in their little tombs...  It has been over 20 years since this terrible tragedy occurred, and almost as long since any of our family has lived in that house. Yet, the house still stands, and the alley remains paved. Now, if J would only borrow Dad's metal detector, as he has often vowed to do, and resurrect those treasures of yesterday, maybe he and M could finish what they started... Better late than never!

      It has been a sad week in MSA One... The great CK, infamous self-proclaimed Supper Hero, is no longer with us. Alas, as of last Thursday, he has gone on to bigger, better, and (hopefully) less tiring things, leaving myself and  Doogie Howser, the Shipper Boy Genius , to hold down the fort for the summer...  Has the  Hive Mind  we call Management completely flipped their lids?!? We're expected to run a full-time warehouse on only  2  guys? No, I don't see any problem with that plan of action... Do you? I'm sure everything will get done accurately and we'll be the Model of Efficiency. Yeah, right. Of course, we  have  been promised for the past 6 months that they will be hiring more people as soon as they get some decent resumes. Hello! This is a warehouse folks! A "decent resume" for a job here would be any one that indicates the applicant is still living... Period.  Anyway, I don't really want this post to be a rant about the Company, so I'll just leave it at that. More about me...   The Great Unboxing and Reboxing Escapade  has finally come to an end, but not without certain consequences... The  Department of Inbound Deliveries  ( DID ) has taken on the look of a scrap yard. There are computers, monitors, and printers from every stage of technology over the last 12 years just piled on skids and strewn about my half of MSA One. Basically, I have about a month and a half worth of product drop-offs from a dozen different locations that I eventually have to sort through, inventory, and make ready for our Production Crew.  Fun.  So, I'm really gonna miss good ol' CK in the coming weeks... Not only for his vast knowledge of music and his domination in  Name That Tune ... Not just for his  He-Man  cartoon collection that kept us amused at lunch... And not only for his  "let's just get it done"  approach to a task. No, I think I'm going to miss him most of all because I just don't want to do all this work by myself! Help!!!  By the way, if you're reading this, and you live in Calgary, and you're looking for a job, drop me an email...   Please!

      No matter how old I get, I think I will always love toys.  When I was a kid, I used to collect "dinky cars", the little  Matchbox  and  Hot Wheels  brand scale replica cars. Back then, they were made to look just like the cars you saw driving around everyday, with the odd "exotic" one thrown in for flavor. Every time my parents took me to the department store, my Dad would let me pick out a new one for my collection. Then I'd take the new treasure home and put it in the little tin box I kept the rest of them in.  As I got a little older, the cars got left behind in favor of  G.I. Joe . These weren't the Barbie-sized ones with the "real" stubbly beard (although I did have one of  those  at one time too), but the smaller "action figures", complete with  Swivel-Arm Battle Grip . I'd spend hours setting up the massive G.I. Joe Head Quarters with it's dual-barrel turret gun, stockade, and computer Command Center. When my Birthday or Christmas rolled around, everyone knew exactly what to get me... More G.I. Joe!  Now that I'm an adult (most of the time), I'd have to say that computers have become my new toy. I don't really play any games on them, but I do enjoy figuring out all the cool things a computer could do, then trying to make it happen. I like to play with my 3 digital cameras and the pictures I get out of them... It's fun to re-mix music and sound-clips... I'm even set up to broadcast my computer's display to any TV in my house and control it with an FM Remote Mouse! Very little of what I do, in fact, is of any use... It's just fun to be able to do it. Hence, the computer is my toy.  Well, my girlfriend played a Trump Card this past weekend when she bought me my new  Ultimate Toy  for  Father's Day : a  portable  DVD player.   I can't even  begin  to tell you how cool that thing is! Sure, I've been watching DVD's for years (even burning a few, from time to time), but this is a whole new experience! I feel exactly like I did when I was 13 years old and I got my first  Walkman ... Well, it wasn't a true Sony Walkman, just a cheap rip-off, but it was huge, silver, and came with the same awesome body-strap that the real thing had. No longer did I have to sit in my Mom's living room with my ear pressed up against the cabinet stereo to hear my  Hit Explosion K-Tel record ... Never again would I have to hear her telling me to turn it down... I was finally free to enjoy my tunes anywhere, anytime!  Now, 20 years later, I've regained that same freedom with my movies... I doubt you'll find me walking down the street watching  Pulp Fiction  anytime soon, but now I can watch a show in bed without disturbing my  Better Half  and road trips with the kids just might be a little quieter.  I could go on and on about it, but I really must get back to  The Bourne Identity ... For crying out loud! The guy can't remember that he's  Matt Damon ! Can you believe it?!?

      I'm alive... barely.  If you've been checking in at  Musings  lately, you might be under the impression that I simply couldn't go on after the Flames failed to bring the Stanley Cup back to Calgary with them. I assure you, however, that is  not  the case... In fact, I got over that pretty fast, all things considered.  If you are a regular reader, though, and have been following the  Scenes from the Forklift , you may have figured out that I've been too busy to blog lately. And in this you'd be mostly correct.  To tell you the truth, my disturbing lack of presence can be blamed on sheer fatigue and nothing new to say. The past week and a half has been nothing but the same old song and dance in the warehouse... Too much work, too few people. So, I figured I wouldn't bore you... Ain't I just the greatest?  I can say, however, that there are things stirring in Cuppojoe's life, things which will definitely warrant a blog or two... So, until then, I now return you to your regularly scheduled broadcast already in progress...

      It's over.  The Calgary Flames, the so-called  Cinderella Story  of the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, have tried on the glass slipper and it doesn't fit. The heart-stopping series went the full 7 games, but it's the Tampa Bay Lightning who have earned the right to hoist hockey's most coveted prize over their heads.   As with Game 6, the Flames didn't seem able to put forth a consistent effort tonight. Instead, it was the Lightning who dominated most of the play. Calgary seemed to come alive in the dying minutes of the Third Period after a goal by  Craig Conroy , but it was too little too late. The final nail in the coffin came with 1:01 left in the game as  Andrew Ferrence  was assessed a 2-minute penalty for allegedly charging Lightning player  Martin St. Louis  behind the Flame net. The call was made by none other than (you guessed it)  urlLink Kerry Fraser . Even though another penalty was called less than a minute later against Tampa, the time for Calgary's come back had passed.  It was such a good ride for Calgary, one of the last teams anyone even expected to be in the Playoffs in the first place, and it was an equally good ride for this city. Even the glory days of the  '88 Olympics  and our Stanley Cup victory in '89 couldn't compare to the spirit that has had each and every Calgarian walking on air for the past 2 months. The dejected Calgary Flames will come home, probably with their heads hung low, but they will come home to a Hero's Welcome. They deserve nothing less. And I'm sure the Flames flags will fly from the cars for weeks to come, honoring the valiant effort put forth by our little underdog team.  And who knows? Just because the ugly step-sister came out ahead this time, doesn't mean Cinderella won't be invited to the ball next year...

      The Calgary Flames lost. They could have been handed the coveted  Stanley Cup  tonight in their home arena... but they lost. The city could have gone crazy with celebration... but they lost. I could have written a happy blog... but they lost.  I'm not going to get into the game this time. I just don't think I have it in me. This whole city was holding their breath, waiting for the  Big Moment  to arrive, but it never did. Now, we all just feel deflated.  However, it's not over yet... This crushing loss was only Game 6. Monday night will tell the final tale of the  2004 Stanley Cup Finals . The Flames are undoubtedly already on their way back to Florida to prepare for the winner-takes-all  Game 7 . I just hope they can do it...  Until then...

      Some people call it a pallet jack. Others call it a pallet-puller or a skid jack. I like to think of it as transportation.  I have to admit, I've become quite the  Pallet Jack Pilot  in my time. Like a kid on a scooter, I can zip from one end of the warehouse to the next... I can maneuver deftly between the piles of product left carelessly about the floor... I can even slalom the warehouse work-horse indefinitely without having to touch the ground! Yes, it has become almost second nature.  Until today.  I was cruising from the  Department of Outbound Deliveries  toward the  Department of Inbound Deliveries , where CK (self-proclaimed   urlLink "Supper Hero"   of MSA One) and I were working for the day. As I was about to round the final corner, I noticed the way was bottle-necked with the forklift parked dangerously close to a skid of dead monitors. A less experienced  Jack Jockey  would have shied away from this tight avenue of approach, but not me. No, sir. I could see that I would easily have a few millimeters of breathing room on either side. Full-steam ahead!  I powered straight toward the forklift, knowing that only a last-second turn would put me past the obstacle. A mere heartbeat before slamming into the massive piece of machinery, I jerked the handle of my pallet jack violently to the right, swinging straight into the channel.  Well, I  thought  it was straight...  In hindsight, it looks like I missed my turn by a few degrees. As the front of my mechanical chariot cleared the side of the forklift, two things happened. First, I found myself heading directly toward CK, who had heard me coming and was watching my approach. The second (and more important) occurrence was the jamming of the jack between the front wheel of the forklift and the skid of dead monitors.   Sudden stop... for the pallet jack.   Newton's First Law of Motion  states that a body at rest will tend to stay at rest, and a body in motion will tend to stay in motion. Well, my body was certainly in motion! Before my brain could comprehend what was happening, I was thrown smack-dab into the middle of a lesson in inertia.  Now, the handle of the jack stands about 3 1/2 to 4 feet off the ground, and it was this part that I was hanging onto (in front of me) at the moment of impact. As my body continued in a straight lined toward the stunned Supper Hero, this handle gave way before me by levering downward, such as it does when one uses it to jack up a pallet. At this point, I had a choice to make:  A.  Let go of the handle and have it spring back towards me with great force, quite likely whacking me in a tender region as I flew over, or,  B.  Continue hanging on and be reverse catapulted into the concrete floor, much like  Wile E. Coyote . Neither seemed to be a very attractive option at the time, and I had precious little time to choose.  In the end, I compromised. I held on as long as I could... Then, like a player in some sadistic, nutcracker version of leap-frog, I spread my legs, pushed the handle down and away from me, and landed clumsily at the exact moment the handle slammed back to it's upright position.  The racket drew a small crowd, not to mention a little blood to my cheeks, but I was none the worse for wear. In fact, instead of making me fear such dangerous antics, I think this incident may have opened my eyes to the possibility of a whole new career:  Warehouse Stunt Man . Why not? They make movies with warehouses in them... And I could do the stunts for all the big name actors! Okay, so I probably won't be filling in for  Stallone  or  Governor Schwarzenegger  anytime soon, but I don't think  Frankie Muniz  or maybe the girl from  "Spy Kids"  is out of the question... Do you?

      When I was a kid I loved to draw. I would draw just about anything, just for the sheer joy of dragging my pencil across the paper and seeing something come to life. It could be  Donald Duck , taken from one of my many storybooks, or perhaps  E.T. , from his appearance on the cover of  People  magazine. It just didn't matter, as long as I was able to create.  As I moved into my teenage years, dragons and sorcerers became a common theme in my sketch books, not to mention snakes, bugs, and knights in shining armor. I was a typical boy, living in a fantastic world as it formed before my very eyes. Still, it was more about the  drawing  than the drawings themselves... The evidence being the odd seashell or potted plant in my work.  Eventually, I became an adult (contrary to what some people may tell you) and the time I could devote to my drawing diminished. I still felt that inexplicable drive to "make something", but I could rarely finish anything before other duties called me away. And to make matters worse, on the occasions when I  did  have the time, I couldn't seem to call forth the talent and would become angry and frustrated. The satisfaction that I had once felt now seemed to be just around the corner but ever-elusive.  Since then, I have dabbled in this and that... I've done a fair amount of cartooning (though I look upon this as mere "doodling" in comparison to my earlier work), I've tried my hand at acting and playwriting (with moderate success), and I've had a book brewing around in my brain for about 7 years now. More recently, I've taken a growing interest in  digital photography  and  digital editing . All in all, the creative force still exists in me, and it is continually trying to find a way to express itself.  And then came  blogging .  I can't begin to explain how good I have felt since I started this silly little page! I can sit here for 20 minutes every few days, throw out a few random ideas or hot-headed rants, and I feel fulfilled! It's amazing! It's exactly like when I was a kid and I'd brush away the last few eraser bits from my paper, stand up, and look down at the picture that came from  my  hand. It's like this overwhelming sense of accomplishment, regardless of whether anybody else ever sees it or not.  So, forgive me if there's an occasional post that seems lame or pointless (like this one, perhaps). I truly enjoy providing entertainment for others but, in the end, it's all about me...  Hey! My Mom was right after all!

      Well, the number of bodies in  MSA One  has swollen from 2 to 6 in a matter of 3 days! Unbelievable, but true. I guess the  Powers That Be  have finally decided against their previous plan to let the company slip into frantic chaos as myself and  Doogie , the  Shipper Boy Genius  slowly sink beneath the rising tide of obsolete and unrepairable electronic paraphernalia of yesteryear...  While it  is  a breath of fresh air to have enough people to accomplish our daily goals for a change, it's incredibly tough train them all at once. They out number us "veterans" 2 to 1, for crying out loud! And we've spent the last few gruelling months churning through the morass of tasks alone, so it's difficult to remember how or what to delegate! It won't take long for them to get tired of hearing, "Uh, well, I don't have time to show you  this  yet... Why don't you grab a broom and sweep that section of floor that Johnny just swept 5 minute ago? Can never be too clean around here, ya know!"  Well, I couldn't let myself worry about these new guys all day, so I did what anybody else would do in my position... I let Doogie handle them.  In truth, today was my first chance in over a month to get back over to my side of the warehouse and start swimming through all the product that has been waiting for me. Knowing that it would be impossible to train someone to help with the job, I told Doogie he could keep the new guys over in the  Department of Outbound Deliveries  until I get my mess straightened out. I'll bring someone over once I can show them what really goes on here, not just a growing, smoldering mountain of unknown gizmos and doo-dads that would have them running home to their Mommies.  See? I abandoned them with Doogie for their own good... Ain't I just the greatest?

      I've heard it many times from co-workers (usually Upper Management, truth be told), but I never really understood it until this last week. It goes something like:    I just got back from holidays and, boy, do I need a vacation!    My week away from work was, in a word, spectacular. We rose at 3am to begin our journey from Calgary to Vancouver, a trip of nearly 1000km through the magnificent Rocky Mountains and the lush interior of British Columbia. Not wanting to miss a single moment of this holiday, I insisted that we drive the entire distance in one day. Thanks to some very nice highways, lots of coffee, and the unwritten rule that 10 or 20km/hr over the speed limit is okay (as if 110km/hr wasn't fast enough), we managed to make fairly good time. In fact, we would have done it in about 12 hours had we not stopped a couple hours short of our destination to visit with my Mom in a city called Chilliwack. But we did, and had a very nice visit at that. So, we dragged our exhausted bodies into a hotel in Vancouver (technically, we were in Burnaby, but it's all Vancouver to me) around 9pm and fell fast asleep. Step One of our mission was accomplished.   The next day was spent trying to figure out a city the size of which I had never had to deal with before. I think that my hometown of Calgary actually covers more area, but I wasn't prepared for the incredible congestion of such a highly-populated city as Vancouver! But, with much cursing and doubling-back to get the exit I missed, we were eventually able to make it to the world famous Stanley Park and the Vancouver Marine Aquarium. To ease the stress of finding the place, we took a leisurely one-hour horse and carriage ride around the Park with a dozen or so other tourist-types, after which we made our way to the Aquarium.    There were so many&nbsp;things to take in, and so many people to push through to see them. I wanted desperately to take a thousand pictures, but most wouldn't or didn't turn out due to the darkness of the undersea exhibits, not to mention the fact that I couldn't possibly have gotten a shot without someone posing for their boyfriend stealing the scene... I did, however, manage to get a few good shots of&nbsp;some coral&nbsp;and a sea otter. I also captured the entire Beluga Whale Live Demonstration on video, which was pretty cool.   After that busy day, we had just enough energy to grab a couple burgers and stumble back to our hotel.   The next day we took a ferry over to Vancouver Island. There, we spent our first 2 days in Victoria, the capital city of British Columbia. It wasn't nearly as busy as Vancouver had been, but still a little on the confusing side. It took us so long to find a decent hotel (somehow, we kept ending up in the "questionable" areas of town) that we very nearly decided to leave and travel further up the island. Fortunately, my girlfriend persuaded me to try a hotel that I was sure was outside our price range. As it turned out, the kind woman at the front desk took pity on us and gave us a great deal on a huge, luxurious room. So we stayed 2 days, as I said.   On our first day, we visited the Undersea Gardens, a touristy little get-up in Victoria Harbour where you can go beneath the water and view a variety of creatures. There was even a live show, where a diver went down to point out the different types of crabs, starfish, and their resident octopus. After that we went Whale Watching. As we were traveling out to the spot where we were to see the whales, I was sure it would be like fishing... We might see one or two in the distance, if we were lucky. Boy, was I wrong! We&nbsp;saw about 60 Killer Whales (Orcas) all around us, jumping, spouting, popping their heads up to look at us! . I was amazed and my girlfriend couldn't stop saying how beautiful they were. To see such incredible creatures swim past our small boat is an experience we will both treasure for the rest of our lives. After that 3 1/2 trip, we were beat again and had to retreat to the comfort of our hotel.   The next day, we went to the Royal British Columbia Museum to see "Eternal Egypt", a collection of Egyptian artifacts on loan from the British Museum in London. My girlfriend and I have been fascinated by Ancient Egypt for years, so this was an opportunity we couldn't pass up. To walk amongst statues, jewelry, and writings from a time up to 5000 years in the past was indescribable. It's one thing to see them on TV or in books, but quite another to have&nbsp;them right in front of you. All in all, what with the Egyptian exhibit, an Imax on the Mysteries of Egypt, and touring the rest of the museum (which is one of the nicest I have ever had the pleasure to visit), we spent a good 4 1/2 hours there, after which we bid farewell to Victoria and continued our journey northward.   After only 45 minutes of driving, we came to the town of Duncan and decided to find a place for the night. I don't want to tell you too much about this stop, because it is worthy of a blog all its own... But I will tell you that we spent an incredible night in the most unlikely of places.    The next day, we were off to Nanaimo (pronounced Na-Nigh-Mo, with the accent on the Nigh). I had lived in a small town just outside Nanaimo when I was 14, so I was eager to go back to some old stomping grounds for pictures. I found my old house had been radically renovated, to the point where it was all but unrecognizable. But the view of the ocean hadn't changed and was as beautiful as ever. I also located a couple of the schools I attended and preserved digitally for all time. We finished off our stay with a walk along the Nanaimo Harbour front, looking at all the boats, visiting the shops, and buying souvenirs. Then, it was back in the van and on to Parksville.   Parksville is&nbsp;a tourist town, through and through. From its long stretch of beachfront hotels, to its miniature golf courses, to its annual Sand Castle Building Competition, it definitely caters to the visitors. We only spent one night there, but we managed to play 2 rounds of minigolf, walk along the beach as the sun went down, and collect shells the next day when the tide went out. All in all, a nice little visit.   We had to return to Nanaimo to catch the ferry back to the Mainland. Once there, we decided to take a little "Picnic Cruise" around the Harbour and out to one of the nearby islands. It was a quite, 2 hour affair, but worth every penny of the $60 it cost us. In fact, it was the perfect way to cap off our trip to the island. After that, we boarded the ferry and began the first leg of our trip home.   We went straight through Vancouver and all the way to Chilliwack, where we stopped in one more time to visit Mom. We stayed and chatted rather late, considering we wanted to travel through a good portion of the night, and didn't really get back on the road until almost midnight. My girlfriend wasn't too happy about that (the late drive, not the visit), but we forged on and made it to the City of Kamloops (about 1/3 of the way home) by 4am. Here, she insisted that we stop and get a room... I was too exhausted to argue!   After about 6 hours rest, we were set to go again and get home to our kids. But, you know what they say about the best laid plans... Before we could even pull out of the parking lot, thick smoke began to pour out from under the hood of the van! And so, we spent another night in the fine City of Kamloops while our transportation was being repaired...   Shortly after the crack of dawn on Sunday morning, we were finally on the road to home. Despite how eager we both were to get the trip over with, the 7 or so hours seemed to fly by. Before we knew it, we could see the outskirts of Calgary on the horizon and our holiday was officially over. It was a bittersweet moment, but we were both too excited about seeing our kids to let it get us down.   Once at home, I had to quickly get some laundry done for work the next day, and then I collapsed into our bed.   I don't think we stopped, or even slowed down, throughout the entire week! There was always somewhere to go, something to see... It really took a lot out of us! That's why I finally understand and wholeheartedly agree: "I need a vacation!"

      Well folks, I must apologize for the definite lack of posting lately. To tell you the truth, it's been a bit of a mad rush to get things done before the  Summer Shutdown . What's that? You don't know about the Summer Shutdown? Well, you see, the warehouse where I work (MSA One, to you faithful readers) closes its doors for a week every Summer, to allow us loyal employees a chance to take some much needed R & R.  So, I'm actually going to leave town this time... In a matter of hours, I will be on the road to Vancouver Island. I haven't been there in 19 years, so I'm pretty excited! Anyway, I'm sure there will be lots of pictures for you when I get back, and I may even try to whip off a quick post if I can find a place to do so (no promises, you understand).  Alrighty then... You kids have a great week, and we'll see you later!

       Guess who's 137 years old today? That's right, it's the second largest country (by land mass) in the world, that's who!  Let's hear it for Canada!!!   There's nothing quite like a National Holiday that lands on a Thursday, is there? Sure, I have to return to work for Friday, but it's going to feel like a one-day work week! Nothing to complain about there, either!  I had high hopes of taking a drive outside the city today. I thought it would be a nice way to celebrate  Canada Day ... Just my girlfriend and I exploring all the towns and country-side that we live so close to but seldom give thought to. It would have been a brilliant idea, had the weather been willing to cooperate! Instead, it's pretty grey and dismal out there right now... So, here we are at home, watching TV.  Oh well, you make the best with what you've got, I suppose... Maybe the weather will clear a little towards the evening and there will be some sort of fireworks display. That would be a lot of fun to go see! At the very least, I'm sure they'll be lighting the flame atop the  urlLink Calgary Tower  in commemoration of this great day. Maybe I'll be able to get a pic or two...

      Lately, I've been joining "the masses" by taking public transit to work. Yep... I'm riding  the bus .  Now I begin everyday with a "jog" to the bus stop that leaves me winded, only to stand around waiting for that 5 minutes that feels like an hour with three other people who take turns staring at their shoes, leaning out and looking up the street for the bus, then glancing at the watches they glanced at 20 seconds ago...  Stare, lean, glance... Stare, lean, glance... Ad nauseum.  When the promised chariot finally arrives, my stop-mates scramble and jockey for position at the  precise  spot they think the driver will stop. We can all see the dozens of people aboard who are forced to stand, but it's like these 3 are sure someone has overlooked the last seat and they  must  get to it! I let them pile on ahead of me, then proceed up the stairs where I almost run over one of them as he stands beside the driver, digging desperately in his pockets for "exact change". It's hard not to smile as I pass him.  As predicted, there is no  Last Seat  and I, too, am forced to stand in the aisle, swaying with every turn and bracing for every hard acceleration and even harder brake. I know this is the only real entertainment that the bus driver gets in his day, so I don't let it bother me. However, the guy beside me with his armpit mashed against my ear can get annoying real fast! A shower and a clean shirt are good, but a sweat-stained jacket  totally  defeats the cause. If only I could reach a window...  I've noticed that the bus is a very strange social situation in and of itself. 50 or 60 people all packed into a relatively small space for anywhere from 15 minutes to half and hour and, aside from the noise of the engine, you could hear a pin drop.  No one is talking!  Where else does this happen? Nowhere! You go to the Supermarket, people are talking up and down the aisles... You go to the park and people are laughing, shouting, making noise... Even in church you find people whispering among the pews! Come to think of it, librarians must be awfully envious of bus drivers...  Occasionally, there will be one talker on the bus... He'll be sitting near the front, saying, "Hello!" as each rider gets on, and trying to make small-talk in much too loud of a voice to anyone who will make eye contact. Which is usually nobody. Anywhere else, this man is considered "polite", "friendly", or "pleasant"... In here, however, he is "weird", "crazy", or "creepy"... You can actually see everybody around him trying to do their best chameleon impression and just blend in with their surroundings. Maybe he's like a T-Rex and if you just hold really still...  To me, a bus ride is the polar opposite of a High School dance. You go because you have to, not because you want to... The wallflowers are the Lords and Ladies of this event, while the loud, outgoing types are shunned and ignored... And there's no fruit punch to spike with vodka. Although, if there were, maybe I wouldn't have had to write this blog!
