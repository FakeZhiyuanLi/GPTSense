       Dear World,   &nbsp;OK, so this is my first post and I am walking in to this thing blind folded but I will figure it out.     &nbsp;  Well, I might as well start off with some sad news...one of my fellow friends passed away due to someone else's stupidity in a car. He was and is a great man...I went to his wake tonight and tomorow is the funeral..which I am not looking forward too. I know that is going to be the hardest part. Its so final and all that.&nbsp; If&nbsp; I can be as happy as he was at the age of&nbsp;48 then&nbsp;I will be blessed. I mean, he never had a negative thing to say...and he didn't have one enemy. Now some people say that and its false...this is so far from false...He had so many people at his wake tonight..just celebrating him and talking about all the things he did and how many lives he touched.&nbsp; So, Gary Leblanc will live on forever..in all of the hearts of the lives he touched...I miss you!    &nbsp;  Lets see, another interesting topic is umm..the wonderful men in my life that I tend to always&nbsp; end up with. Call it fate or call it being unlucky...but they all tend to share one adjective "asshole".&nbsp; Maybe its the fact that they are like normally 8-10 years older than me or maybe its because they are all bachelors-never been married-no kids- and no focus besides themselves and what piece of ass they are getting tonite mentality. Let me explain a bit more for those of you who are interested...if not...scroll down to the next paragraph... So first there was Colby when I was 18 which was a total disaster. He was 26 at the time and I guess I was a trophy. But regardless...almost 11 mos. in the so called relationship I thought I was in it all went sour. So a man who constantly used to want sex...was now saying he was tired or sick or whatever it was that nite...and I was so naive that I didn't even see it coming. So stupid I was even after we broke up I wasted another year on the guy only sharing half of his life..the unknown to anyone else..(leave out the back door not front type of relationship). Until finally he found a new girl, Cassidy, which by the way "FUCK YOU Cassidy", ok i feel better now, to slowly waste&nbsp; away on. To this day he still pops in on my life. NO, not like that.. I wish :), its more like a hey whats up? who are you dating? would you still sleep with me? kinda pop in. We share the same circle of friends so its often that I bump into him but moving on to the next ass....   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here comes Eric, so sweet and so kind ...STOP, ok, like that could ever be true..WAKE UP JESSICA...So, here it goes...He has been married and divorced twice and in the process of his third divorce...at the age of 31...duh! should of been a sign huh? Well, I am naive remember? So this also lasted blissfully for 10-11 mos and then the same signs came again....sooner or later it always happens right? The only difference in this one is that he is alot ruder...He came right out and said he was done with it and he meant it....so for 3 mos. never heard from the guy and last week he calls me two times! Sweet talking me as usual and I can tell he is buttering me up for somthing but I am not gonna fall for it...besides If&nbsp; I do...what am i to do with my half current ass.. ????&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His name is Will, and he 33, seems like hes got it all together...he is enrolled in grad school..works a steady job at local club as a manager andworking on a new club in a surrounding city...wines me, dines me, and all the other hoorah..i'll save you those details... : ) and this is off and on for like 7 mos...but recently I was told I will be really busy next week...so it has been two weeks since I have got a phone call..so this is either an off time or never again time...I guess only time will tell but my goal for this fall semester is to find a guy who is not 30 plus and just not worry about all the bull shit..so whoever is to blame here really doesn't matter. I guess they are just too old for me...I mean really how can a 23 year&nbsp; old and 31 year old or around that age relate? Well, besides, between the sheets...thats a given... So, no more of all that...I am just gonna focus on school and hey if I find a dude then cool, if not..hey one less asshole around. ha&nbsp;    &nbsp; I have no idea what you are thinking right now as you all are reading this but this is like 6 years rolled into 4 paragraphs..so don't judge too hard...there is alot of pieces missing in this story of my clueless love(lust) life. Have no fear I will keep you guys posted of all juicy updates...don't hold your breath though.&nbsp;    &nbsp; Well, if you have made it this far congrats and I must part now..but I will&nbsp;leave you with this thought ....sex can never be just sex...it always gets complicated...ALWAYS.. I'll continue with a new post tom.     &nbsp;  Nite World,   Jesse
