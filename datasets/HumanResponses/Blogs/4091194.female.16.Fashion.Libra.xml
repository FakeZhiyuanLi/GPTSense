      It's hot today in New York. The sun beats on my brow relentlessly, the breeze is clement but not cool - but it is beautiful. It is good to be with people I love and who love me in return. London has a way of sucking all the juice out of you, till ur like a dried prune - here I find oasis, rehabilitation, and calm.  Life is good and I am grateful to the Father for all the gifts He has given . People here ask me 'how is the queen?'; I tell them I am waiting to meet her grandson. 'Which one?' they ask. Ahh, those who know me well will know the answer. I have been taking my hair out all day, and now I have a bouffant 'fro. I intend to scare all the stiffies at church with it. If they ask, I'll say ' the righteous shall be as bold and strong as a lion.'  I've been reading a lot lately.  God is a Matchmaker  by Derek & Ruth Prince;  The Making of a Lamb , by my dear mother Funke Alabi;  Shaping History Through Prayer & Fasting  also by Derek Prince; and very importantly  God a Good Father  by Michael Phillips. I was reading  God is a Matchmaker  while in London, and my uncle saw me - I wondered, 'what must he be thinking? this young girl reading about marriage and relationships?'. Well, I say there's nothing wrong with being prepared; cos when I meet Prince Willy it's a wraps.

      Have you ever woken up from a dream, where you saw someone but we're actually thinking of someone else? Where two personalities were superimposed to create a more distinct whole? Where you awoke, and the residue of the dream world seemed to linger for that extra moment?We are the guardians of our own hearts - I must learn to keep my own.

      Lightning blazed and rent the sky in two. Relentlessly it cracked, like a master's whip upon a slave's back.  Violent rolls of thunder followed; their bass echoing that of the deep.  I watched it from inside... listening, waiting. The phone rang.     Seun: I got my work permit!

       God just revealed to me that I am afraid...afraid of change...afraid of what I do not know. There are many things that require us to step out in faith - but faith is to be led; faith is to have no mind of your own, but to depend on the prompting and guidance of God. I give over all I am, because flesh is grass. God is eternal and we must learn to walk as He walks. I know something is coming; I feel change on the horizon; I am  certain  of a new beginning. And the word of the LORD came to me saying: Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing,yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

But ah well, you look fwd to one thing and lose another - that's life. I don't know; I'm expectant...but expectant of what??? Um, im not sure...not yet: just something...something in the air. It's coming, it's coming,  something is coming  see it approaching from the mist, see it arising from the ashes, see it spring forth like a phoenix from the ashes...

       Today I read a poem at the National Night Out march against violence. It was a rallying of youth from Brooklyn who believe in discipline, non-violence, and creative expression. It was powerful, to see so many young people come out and speak against violence in such creative forms. I was wondering  but how much impact can I make? just one poem in one city.. . Then I realized that's what makes America what it is. Everyone is heard, every voice is important.  What we do today goes a long way to making tomorrow a better day.  This is what they believe, and this is what they fight for. At the opening, the national anthem was played by a trumpeter and a drummer;and it was   beautiful:commanding,strong,solemn. It was a wonderful occasion - one of those memories that will stay with me for a long time.       ***   Right now my mother is making my dress for Adeolu's wedding. It will be glorious (my dress I mean! - wink -but of course the wedding also).    I finish with this proclamation:August 2004 is my month of  greatness ,   and I  shall  be great in this month according to the word of the Lord - this is the beginning of months, the beginning of days. This is a  new  day: this is the day of the LORD.

       Yesterday started of with a bang - really. Period pains exploding in my nether regions. Well, that didn't leave me in the lightest of spirits, so I spent most of the day sleeping. Today I feel much better, but honestly, I have served notice on that sadisitic demon. Pastor Arogundade said,  the scepter of wickedness will not rest on the lot of the righteous.  I agree with that Word. I'm a little tired, as I had to wake up at 5:30 for service this morning (yyaaaawwwwnnn). Neverthless I still have to go the Arabic church this evening-they have invited me to sing, and woe betide me if I reject the calling of God.      *** Last night I was praying asking God:  Why do I think about him so? Why does he invade my thoughts and imaginations as if he has some significance? Why am I preoccupied with the one? I am curious and desiring. Desiring of his touch and his embrace. I wonder about his look, his name, his laugh. I have dreamt of him since I was 4 years old. Too young to fully comprehend, but comprehending still. Where is he? Perhaps the most pertinent question of all;the most troubling.  God gives His best to those who leave the decision to Him . The wise words of Mr. Prince - twice successfully married, and a minister of God. I once read that what a man lets into his heart is his own choice. Perhaps this is where problems begin: when we dont guard our hearts properly - when we let anything in.
