      This life is taking a change for the worst. I'm a freakin soccer playa and friends keep on telling me to play basketball. Maybe I'll try to pick that up and still play soccer? Tiring but possible. Still wants a rank in the world for WWE rawdeal. Until then, maybe catch some sleep.  ~  Lemme knock your teeth out!

Taking change for the worst, enjoy a new catch phrase by me every update!   ~   Shut up ya old baffon!

      I finally quit Rawdeal...how sad...but life moves on...I guess it also great that Greece won the european cup and congratulation to them. Greeks are successful because of their hard work and I am sure they'll do well in the world cup. Hi to my friends in Yishun Town Secondary school and about the backout in the school today...I wish it would have lasted longer...or something...Spider man 2 was awsome but it was more than what I am waiting for...maybe I'll finally get to meet Jojo? She's way too awsome! I love her music!!! Life moves and what can I say? People change...Soccer rocks! Greeks are cool!  ~  Maybe when I finally get up...god will greet me!

          Ndp...what a day...surely i like the scenery of the place...parade square is full of people who are performing and dancing gracefully...they are so cool...but the better things are the Xishan Primary school kids coming and performing (You guys are sooo awsome!) the NCC are great too...they really showed us what co-ordination really is...they are really fantastic (Nice one to Wei Xiang, Kai Xiong and Firman...)  Today had been quite a good day...not to mention sleeping until 4PM...haix...but it was good that I can actually eat something (Only a few would know what I mean...) and well...I feel kinda depressed so I'll just write up to here...  Farewell and take care to all that reads this...until next time...  Also thanks to "Wise Granny" Mei Fang...she is really a person who we can respect...though she seems pretty pissed of with Firli today...Mei Fang ar...relax...smile always! =)
