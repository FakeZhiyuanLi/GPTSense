      A tsunami, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a tidal wave, is a series of large waves created when either nearshore or undersea earthquakes occur causing sudden movement of the seafloor. The seafloor's movement generates a sudden impulse that causes the water column to displace vertically. The result is a large train of waves. As the wave approaches shallow water, it slows down, but the energy of the wave remains constant. This action causes the wave to increase in height, as high as 30.5 meters (100 feet), in some instances.   Tsunamis . . . How Are They Affecting People? There is a very short time span for people to evacuate following an earthquake or tsunami warning. Tsunami events affecting the U.S. and its territories have been responsible for almost 470 fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars in property, infrastructure, transportation, and lifeline damage. The U.S. has not experienced a major tsunami since the Great Alaskan Earthquake at Prince William Sound on March 28, 1964. That event killed 10 people and caused more than $7 million in property damage in Crescent City, California. It caused 106 fatalities and more than $84 million in damage in Alaska.   The Pacific Northwest is vulnerable to tsunamis generated by local and distant earthquakes throughout the Pacific Ocean basin. The greatest tsunami threat for the Pacific Northwest results from earthquakes generated along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ).   The last major tsunami event in the Cascadia region was the 1964 Alaskan earthquake mentioned above, which produced waves of more than 4 meters (13 feet) at several locations along the west coast. Since that time, several earthquakes in the Pacific Basin have resulted in tsunami warnings and/or measurable events along the west coast, including the April 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquake.   While none of these events have resulted in major damage, the great increase in coastal development in recent decades warrants attention and mitigation for tsunami hazards

      lightning kills more people annually in Florida than all other weather hazards combined.&nbsp; Anytime you are outdoors in Florida, you are at risk of being struck by lightning.&nbsp; By learning about this fascinating meteorological event and its safety rules, you can prevent serious injuries or death.&nbsp; While Florida is the most lightning-prone state in the country, the world record belongs to Kampala, Uganda with an average of 280 thunderstorm days per year.&nbsp; Central Florida averages about 90 thunderstorm days per year and receives almost twice the number of lightning strikes as other areas in the nation.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Because lightning seeks the path of least resistance on its way to and through the ground, the human body is an extremely good conductor because of its high water content.&nbsp; Importantly, metal is a better conductor than most other objects.&nbsp; Lightning can travel through metal fences and railroad tracks.&nbsp; Even when the storm occurs at a distance, standing too close to tall metal objects can cause serious injury
