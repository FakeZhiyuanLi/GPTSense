       My eyes are burning, and I can't figure out if it's the fact that I may have just gotten soap in them, or if it's the smoke I'm exhaling. It could always be that I want to cry, but I'm not. Last night I cleaned my room and threw out over 20 cans of Mountain Dew. Not even a full day later, there's 3 cans already sitting here. What does that say to you? I'm a loser. I sit at my computer and drink Mountain Dew. Okay, I'm not a complete loser. I have a life, but as soon as I come home... I'm just a lazy S.O.B. Last night was amazing. Pat and I have always had a rough relationship, mostly the last few months. Do you know how good it felt to be able to be around him without fighting over something or talking about "us"? Okay, well, it was weird, but yet relaxing. I had a smile on my face that wouldn't go away. He even called me after he got home to talk (as if I didn't just spend the last few hours with him). Why can't we get along like that everyday? Today was a complete waste of time. Shana needed to be kidnapped because her house was driving her nuts, and this town is pointless, so we took a nice little trip to BD. I told my cousin, Michelle, that we might stop over and she somehow convinced me to pick up her little friend Nick. What, Nick doesn't have legs and can't get his ass over to her house? Whatever, I did it anyways. I pulled up in my ghetto green van into the back parking lot of my dad's business. Fast-forward to us heading towards Michelle's house. I lit up a cigarette and not 5 seconds later he asked to bum one from me. Dude, you're younger from me and I don't like being an influence to people. Smoking was my decision and I don't support it. Not only that, but I DON'T KNOW YOU. Being the sweetheart I am, I said yeah, but told him not to bother asking again, I'm not made of money (you can say that again, I am so broke that the most I ever put in my van at a time is less than 10 dollars). Sooner or later, I went to Wal-mart. I love Wal-mart. It's so simple and cheap. I got two tank-tops for around $7. You better believe I love it. After hanging out with a few friends, I came home with a message from Pat waiting for me. It said something along the line of, "I'm going to bed earlier than normal because I'm tired as all hell from work, plus, I wouldn't want to bother you when you're with small one." Okay, so his grammar was probably about 50 times worse, but you get the point. Yeah, it was sweet that he was thinking about me, but don't give me that "I have to work" shit. Suck it up buddy. "You can take that J-O-B and shove it up your anus." -Tech N9ne.

       My original plans were to follow the Oakfield boys to Redgranite to swim at the quarry. They backed out. I had already asked Jessie to come swimming with me, and since they backed out, we decided we'd rather go swimming on Big Green. Are you crazy? Two girls are going to drive to somewhere they've never drove before? But how lost can I get going 25 miles? Oh, I'm sure we could get lost... easily. Thank God for the natural skills of, "um, excuse me sir, where in the world is Dodge Memorial Park? We're not from around here." And then I'll just bend over while pumping my gas. That'll get us a decent reply. My main goal is to make it there with no problem so we can say, "we don't need men, we're smart enough ourselves!" I just realized... I'm broke and we wont have much food. My dad's sick of me asking for cash, infact, he told me to get a job. Maybe I'll tell Jessie to pack a meal for us. Hopefully she's not like my family and actually has things in their cupboards. I should get to bed, considering we came up with the genius idea to leave at 9am. Just hold on a second, I'm not done. Dumbass never called me today, and I was really looking forward to talking to him. On the other hand, I did have Nick come over and he suffered and watched tv with me for an hour and a half with my dad and Jen. He must be insane. Nick's a good guy and all, but I'm just not seeing anything happening. I'm horrible at hinting that I'm not interested, I tend to be too sweet about it. Fuck me, I'm cursed to break hearts.

       Today is my mom's 42nd birthday. She was originally going to have us to day, but switched a day with my dad. Why? Because celebrating with her boyfriend is more important. Wow. Cool.  Kat just called me not too long ago and informed me that she's for sure pregnant. She went to the doctor and she's about 7 weeks along. Wow. She just turned 17, but at least she waited until she was married. When I told Pat, his reaction was, "already!? They just got married." Oh well, I'm happy with her, it's exciting. Chris is hoping it's a girl, but I'm sure he'll love the baby no matter what. I made plans with Kat for Saturday, because I totally forgot that it's her weekend off and I already made plans for Friday with Pat.  I sense it to be another night of staying home. Not because I want to, but because I have nothing to do. Ugh.

       It's 5:46 in the morning, and I can't figure out why I'm sitting here, on my computer. I woke up because of a horrible nightmare. Someone stole my cigarettes and I was PISSED. I don't remember why, but in my dream we had to put all of our things from out of our lockers into some box. I included my cigarettes with this. Some other chick did too, the same kind too. After some class, I went back to get my things and leave for the summer; apparently it was the last day. Kaitlyn handed me a crushed box with 3 left in it and I said to her, "Those aren't mine, I had like, 8 left." When I said that, Raeven handed me another box and goes, "Are these yours?" I nodded my head and she dashed off with them. I started screaming down the hallway at her and no one seemed to care. That was extremely strange, considering it took place in my elementary school.  When I woke up, I had such a craving. For water. It's understandable when you crave a soda or something with a taste, but who craves for water? Well, I have my water, and not just any kind of water. I'm a high-roller; I have Aquafina. Or should I say, AquafinA. For some reason, that's the way the label is printed.  Not only was I craving water, but doritos. I know we have some around here somewhere, but I can't figure out where. I looked in the cupboard, but no luck. I even looked in my little brother's room. Not there. My stomach is speaking in tongues. I guess it would probably be a good idea if I start eating more. Mini-meals aren't very healthy, you know. So, I think I'll stop typing this boring, pointless, stupid shit and find those chips. Then I might be able to get back to sleep. And since I'll be satisfied then, I might have a good dream.

       I called my mom earlier tonight around 9 to ask her about going swimming. It is now 12:43 a.m. and she just called. She asked me what I was doing up. Um... YOU CALLED ME. So she says I can't go to Redgranite, and I said that was fine because we wanted to go to Green Lake instead. She said we'd talk about it in the morning. Excuse me miss, we want to leave in the morning. If she says no, she'll have one cranky girl on her hands. Man, she's such a bitch to me. She trys so hard to control my life, even when I'm at my dad's house. My dad just knocked on my door and said my mother called him. He asked what my plans were and I said we changed them and wanted to go to Green Lake. End of story. Why can't my mom be as cool as him? I wont be posting anything for awhile, my dad's going to Rock Fest this weekend, so I'm at my mom's until Sunday. I'm preparing for hell.

       This weekend was a long one. Friday I saw King Arthur with Pat. The movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Afterwards be drove around FDL for awhile... for who knows what reason. I was also forced to go to car lots... FUN. When we left FDL, Pat went down County TC, which I thought he was just taking to get back to town faster. That wasn't the case. We pulled into his parent's property, where he takes his 4wheeler. For once, it wasn't my idea to pull over somewhere. I didn't give into the pressure though. I did kiss him, but when he stole my full pack of cigarettes and put them down his pants, I just left them there. Props buddy; nice try. When we got back to town, we were going to find Jereme and do something with him. When we walked up to Jay's, we found him... along with Austin, Cheeto, Shana and Tanya. Earlier I had told Pat that I didn't want to drink (he asked me why I didn't want to go to Sam's going-away-party, and that was my excuse), but when I got up to Jay's, Shana had some UV. Of course... I gave in. I ended up feeling guilty since Pat has "given up drinking" and I just drank infront of him, but the feeling didn't last long. For some reason, the five of them decided to all leave and let us be alone. I ended up getting upset because earlier that night he said something about how people can't always have what they want... and believe me, I know that. I went into our "action-figure room" and laid down... face down. He came and found me and asked me what was wrong. I, of course, said nothing, so he left me in there. Then he disappeared through the front door without me noticing. Shana and Tanya came upstairs and came in the room with me. We whispered to each other about how big of a dick Pat is to me (thinking he was still there) and decided that I needed to forget about it. When we got into the living room, we realized he wasn't there! I was ppppppppissed. After dancing for awhile, like a bunch of dorks, I ran downstairs to find him. There he was, sitting in his car, by himself. I asked him his problem and remember saying something back to him and then running to my van, where I got in and backed out. I went around the parking-lot where I honked my horn without trying to. I realized that it wasn't a good idea to drive home just yet. So I parked my van again and got in his car, where I started crying. He comforted me, but I still wouldn't tell him what was wrong. I promised him that it wasn't anything he did. He had to be home, so I told him to just call me. When I went back upstairs, it was just the guys. Not a good idea. Jereme found a spatchula and used it on my ass, then Austin joined in. They found another one and decided that they needed to slap it at the same time, and I let them. They swung, full-blown. I now have a few bruises in the shape of a spatchula. After viewing it myself in the bathroom, I decided I needed to show them, so I dropped my pants. More than once. Infact, we went to Sam's going-away-party and I dropped them there too. If Pat knew that, oh man... Pat called me later and we talked for an hour about things. I couldn't help but get upset. Saturday I thought he was pissed or sick of me because he wouldn't answer his phone for me, but Sunday night he picked up. Infact, he left Jereme and Tasha's apartment to come over by me. Aw, how fuckin sweet, aye? Saturday night I went to the Union. For once, the guys actually allowed me to play a game of basketball with them, two infact. I don't remember what pissed me off, but I was steamed about a lot of shit and Crystal and I decided to go to Pat's house and light 'em up. Haha. It was fun, yet so childish. Today Shana and I went to McCune. When I went off the high-dive, I must have smacked the water wrong. My ear hurts ...badly. My dad thinks I bruised it. The sun didn't do me any favors either. I feel so tired and worn out from getting too much of it. Good news though - my daddy's back.

        Last night wasn't the most eventful night, but I still had my fun. We talked to Jake for awhile and shot the shit, then Shana and I decided to drive to BD, where we harassed random people by yelling shit out the windows of my van. At one point these guys tried picking us up, so I decided to pull over. We were right by them when my phone rang. It was Pat. My guilty conscience answered the phone and ignored the guys. We walked right back and they tried to get us to come over by them and I told them to hold on. They're  probably still "holding on" seeing as though I jumped back in my van and left. Picking up guys while on the phone with Pat wasn't a choice. I was surprised that he called in the first place. We chit-chatted for awhile and he made plans for us for tonight after he gets done with work. Wow, either he's changed or he's looking for a piece. Even though I know I wont be able to go, I asked him if he wanted to go to Chi-town with me on Saturday for Hot Import Nights. He said that we'd talk about it tonight. I'm suppose to go swimming with Gwen and Crystal today. Swimming, again. Blah. I have to say this though, I love Alicia. I talked to her last night and she can always make me smile. Damn that girl for being funny.

       Wow, it's been awhile since I could write in here. I'm finally back from my long "vacation" with my mother. THANK GOD. I went to Gurnee, IL. to Six Flags and Gurnee Mills with my mom, bro and Raeven. We had a blast (spending money just seems to fill the loneliness in my life... hmm). I had my encounter with Justin when I got back from Gurnee, Friday afternoon. DAMN that boy is fine. *sigh* The rest is secret. I've been talking to Paul a lot recently, and I seem to miss him. Maybe not him, but the way he used to treat me. He's always telling me I need a man who treats me like a princess, nothing less. And to tell you (whoever the hell "you" is) the truth, he was always sweet to me. I mean, within the short time we were unoffically "together" last fall, he was a gentleman (to my face). He surprised me by showing up on my doorstep one night (he had told me he would still be in Indiana; working), took me shopping... anything I wanted, he took care of. He later admitted to fooling around with other girls, but I like honest guys, so I didn't take it hard. Over a half a year later, here we are, becoming close friends. It's nice and all, but he's now in Oklahoma. Not only that, but I don't think I ever lost feelings for him. I mean, my feelings were never very STRONG, but for the given time I had with him... they were. The whole time we didn't talk after the sudden ignoring of each other... I would think of him. Not every night; just once in awhile when I'd get upset and think about how shitting people tend to treat me. He'd always stick out and I'd always have to tell myself, "You're an idiot for keeping him out of your life, he treated you like you're actually something amazing... which you're not." At times I can look at myself in the mirror and see a beautiful blonde, with amazing blue eyes, a great figure and an amazing smile; rare though. Almost everyday, I really see a pathedic excuse of a life. Gray eyes, a thick coat of fake blonde (or is it yellow?) hair, fat, and flat chested. But those days that I actually feel beautiful, I dream about modeling, though I know it could never happen. Mostly with my attitude, or should we call it "self-esteem"? Whatever that is. You're your own worst critic... but I honestly try to see the good in me. I see nothing.

       Paul called me around quarter to 11, and we chit-chatted for a few minutes, and then asked if he could call me back in a few. Yeah, sure, no big deal. But he forgot. So, being a doll, I just called him around 11:30. He answered and seemed excited to talk, and I asked him if he forgot to call me back. He drunkenly admitted that yes, he did forget. No problem! But we continue speaking, until the point that he has to hit on a female, and then inform me that he did, as if I'm deaf and didn't hear it myself. Hey buddy, your phone was still ON when you were hitting on her. So I sarcastically said, "that's nice." This leads to him telling me, ONCE AGAIN, that he "can get any girl down here." every time he drinks, I hear that. The next day, or maybe even right after he says it, he'll say he's sorry. He'll make up for it by telling me flattering things, and calling me his baby, his girl, hunny, or sweetie. I envy his roommates. I'd love to be there with him, at least one night. But instead, I'm just a girl, back home in Wisconsin. I wont see him until December. And outside of the fairy tail I'm living, I'm nothing but a good piece of ass to him. Maybe a good friend, good listener. That's all. I'm just an all around "good-girl" to him. The perfect girl. The one who would date him, and yet allow him to be with other girls. Because that sweetness, fake or real, makes me feel special. I don't really care if it's fake, I love it. I never hear anything nice said about me...mostly to my face. I'd rather be lied to and flattered, that told the truth and feel ugly. I'm a little pissed at the fact that I asked Pat to call me tonight. I understand that he works 12 hour days, but it doesn't take that much fucking effort to call and talk for a little bit. Asshole. And he wonders why I get so cranky and pissed off. Maybe I blow it up a little, but dammit, YOU'D BE THE SAME WAY IF I DID THAT TO YOU. Motherfucker. Sometimes I seriously feel like I want to pop him one right in the face. Maybe that's not why I'm pissed. Maybe I'm not pissed at all, just upset. Upset at the fact that I'm alone, and am not worth committing to, apparently. A year and a half spent trying to win his heart, and I'm still alone, hurting, crying.

       For being grounded, this week has been pretty good. Last night Pat told me he would talk to his mom either today or tomorrow and have her talk to his dad about me. I hope he's not just saying that. This could be a big step for us. He assured me he really wants things to work with us. *happy sigh* Last night Julie called me. I haven't talked to her in a year and a half. We chatted for hours, til 2 a.m. Today she brought the kids over. I couldn't be any happier! The bad part? I caught my brother in LIES. She finally proved me wrong, and I really don't know what to say about it. *shakes her head in shame* He's so pathedic....

       There has been plenty of things that happened lately to put in here... but I wasn't sure if I wanted to. So, let's stick to the important things. Pat told me that he did infact, talk to his mom about me. And supposibly, she talked to his dad. I'm not sure if he's just saying that to make me feel better or if he actually did. I doubt a lot of what he tells me, but why shouldn't I? I mean, he's lied so many times to me, and he talks behind my back (I don't think he realizes that I know that). Friday, after getting extremely pissed off, I drove off to Tasha's place. We sat down and talked to calm me down, and without me even having to say anything, she proved that he was lying to me about something. Not only that, but she mentioned how she didn't get him. Behind my back he complains about me and bitches and moans and talks shit. When I'm around him, it's different. Fuckin cool. I went back to talk to him after leaving her place, and after denying it for awhile, he finally admitted to lying about drinking. He knows what I feel about that kind of stuff. Though, the next night he did call and tell me he was going to be drinking. I give him props for that, at least. I'm so stressed out about this shit. I want there to be more with us.. and for some reason I'm really afraid that I'm going to lose him soon. Matt comes home in a month... I'll probably see him...uh, NEVER. It's not bad enough that I've always been last on the "important people" list of his. I've always been second to Jereme... and well, everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against his friends, mostly Matt (infact, I miss that kid, he was a great friend)... but I feel so unworthy. So many people tell me I could get better, but it tends to go in one ear and out the other. I know I could be treated better, believe me... but I don't know. Something must be wrong with me. I was just thinking about how I've never given the address out for this damn thing. Maybe I'm afraid to show people I know what I'm really thinking. Sometimes my thoughts can be really harsh, and sometimes I'm just too honest. I'm afraid of hurting someone. Maybe I'll give someone the address sometime. Doubtful though. I just realized that I'm talking to myself though. Oh well, sometimes you just have to let it all out. In that case. MOTHERFUCKER, CUNT, ASS, FAGGOT, DUMBASS, BUTTFUCKER, ASSLICKER, LA LA LA LA LA LA. My life sucks. No, really. Look at me. I'm slowly losing all of my friends, I drive a fucking van, have no job, my family is constantly pissed at me or treating me like shit, I don't have a boyfriend, I'm not loved by that many, I'm sitting here writing in this fucking thing... ugh. I just want to drink myself gone right now... and I'm seriously considering it. Might as well, no one's going to miss me. And if they do, they'll forget me sooner or later. Oh how fucking sad that I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself. I just want to move away and become... someone else. Or just start my life over, because I really hate all of this. If it makes you feel any better (uh, yeah, I'm talking to myself here), at least I'm not the one who ended up pregnant. I just want to be loved.

       Last night I went to Horicon and BD with Tasha, Jereme, and Pat. That was... POINTLESS. Heath called me while I was in the car with them... and when I hung up the guys wanted to know who it was. I wouldn't tell them, which pissed them both off. What gives them the right to ask me anyways? I'm not taken! I got my hair foiled and cut today. All I have to say is.... DAAAAAAAAMN. It looks hella good (which it better, for $90). Now I'm gonna have to get rid of the boy... I'm too damn good looking. Muwahaha. I'm full of myself...

       What does it take to satisfy me? I'm so complicated and I wish I wasn't. The simple things that I used to eat up just don't make me feel the same way anymore. Those cute little things that Pat would do or say just isn't cute anymore. I've heard it before, it's time to step it up and treat me right. Lately I've been getting hit on... A LOT. And people keep trying to hook me up with "friends" of theirs. Like Shana - wants me to hook up with Heath. Jake gave John my number and I just spent the last hour on the phone with me. Julie wants to hook me up with a guy named Joe. Why now? Why never before? I haven't changed, or at least I think I haven't. So why now? I just wrote this to Pat: My whole mind is going in circles, and I'm getting so sick of it. I'm sorry for the way I've been lately, but here's why. Lately, I've noticed that a lot of guys are suddenly interested in me. I get hit on every other day, and guys that I've known for awhile are suddenly interested in me. Not only that, but people are constantly trying to hook me up with other people. Just to name a few, Shana wants me to hook up with Heath, Jake's trying to hook me up with John, and Julie wants to hook me up with Joe. I know NONE of these guys, but yet they think it's a good idea. Why am I suddenly getting this attention? I haven't changed. It seems that the more I get attatched to you, people try to take me away and test me. They test me GOOD, temp me with things and use their knowledge about you and me against me. People who don't even know you want you to be out of my life. I haven't complained to ANYONE lately (besides Tasha) about anything you've done/haven't done. Jealousy? I don't know. I've heard so much lately about how I shouldn't waste my time with you and how "I deserve better" that it makes me want to scream. I don't want to hear that shit! If I felt the same way, I'd definantly be dating one of the many guys who supposibly want to be with me. It hurts me when people talk trash about you or our "relationship" and it's not right. The only person who has been supportive about things, has been Tasha. Jereme doesn't really say anything at all about it, but then again, I don't talk to him. People make things seem so much worse than it really is. They put these thoughts about how things should be - in my head. Like, how you treat me. Everyone says I need to be treated better, like a princess. You're damn right I should, but I shouldn't have to give up on you to get it. You have been treating me pretty good, compaired to the way things used to be, and I appreciate it. I'm just so frusterated with people who think they have the right to tell me how to run my life, and who think they have the right to rip you apart and make you sound so shitty. I haven't said anything about people always saying shit because I tend to be over-protected towards you. I don't want you to get upset, or pissed off at people, because when I see you like that, it makes me hurt inside. As I write this, someone is trying to convince me to find someone else, and I went off. I told her that she needs to keep her comments to herself because she doesn't know you, or even half of what our "relationship" is about. She called me a stubborn little bitch and said I was completely blind. Blind to what? If anyone's blind, it's everyone who has to make stupid fucking comments like that. How can people judge you and me if they're not involved with it? I informed her that yes, even if other people don't believe me, I love you. And I love you for always being there for me. I can honestly say that you're the only one who truely watches out for me and supports me, and even cares that much about me, though, sometimes you don't show that. Sometimes I think about the past and I worry about being hurt again, but I have a lot of faith in you. I trust you with my heart. And lately, I've noticed a little more effort from you. Like, talking to your mom. I didn't expect you to EVER do that. I guess now I just wish something else would happen. I don't know, I'm just ranting. Give me a call after you read this so we can talk, please.

       I've been having such a hard time with myself. I'm too good for certain people, but never good enough for those I have a lot of feelings for. I met Jon on Friday, and apparently, he's head over heels for me. He's called me at least twice a day to check up on me and flatter me some more. He left early Saturday morning for work and has been on the road since. Every minute he gets, he calls me. I talked to his partner and I'm told that all he does is talk about me. Jon tells me that he has a lost for words when it comes to me, and all he can think about is coming home. Buddy; you don't know me. Don't get me wrong, it feels good to already have someone practically wrapped around my little finger, but damn, give it some time! It makes me feel good about myself, but on the other hand, I feel shitty. I mean, who wouldn't when the guy you've been on and off with for a year and 8 months wont even talk to you? I haven't spoke with him since Thursday. I understand that he might be a little pissed off because of what I said to him, but DAMN, you don't have to be an asshole to me. 4 days later and you're still pissed? Get over it and grow the fuck up. It's not like I did something unforgivable. All I said was that I was pissed off, and that I had the right to be pissed at people who treat me like shit. It's true, right? I was just hinting to him that he needed to step it up and start treating me right for once. And look what happens when you do that shit! Someone else picks up where you left off. Serves you right, you fucking ass. I deserve to be treated like a fucking princess, and Jon agrees. So there you go. Ya damn right I'm going to rub it in your face. Maybe you should listen to your mother when she tells you to call me now! Your mom's a smart woman, why don't you try to learn something from her? I can hear it pouring outside my window, and I just realized that I don't know who I'm talking to. I'm talking to myself, yet some of the things I write are pointed to a person in particular. It's things I'd love to say to their face; out of anger; but can't, because I'm too sweet to be like that. No, that's not why. The truth is; I don't want to lose anyone. Speaking of losing people. FUCK YOU TWO WHORES. Though I know you aren't reading this (no one does), I just wanted to let you know that you BOTH such. You deserve each other. What's better than having a back-stabbing, trash-talking, fake-ass friend when you're one yourself? Maybe some day you'll both grow up. Have you turned into lesbian lovers now? You sure as hell look like it. You're damn near attatched at the hip. Maybe I need to grow up. I'm just pissed that it took me this long to find out who you both really are. I should've seen it. It feels like I've lost two of my best friends, but I'm better out without you. I don't need to turn out like either of you two. August 14 was my nephew's 5th birthday. Every day is a blessing with him around. I love that boy more than anything in the world. He will always be my life, even if I don't see him as much as I used to. Shame on my big brother. Shame on him for lying to my family to their faces. Shame on him for lying his ass off to me. Shame on him for calling me today and interrogating me (not like I told him anything anyways). Fuck him for being the lying bastard he is. At first I felt bad for his girlfriend, Katie, but after last night's incident, I'm not sure I feel as sorry as I was. Julie gave me Alayna's old clothes to give to Katie for Kaylin when she gets bigger, and you know what that bitch said to me? She told me she didn't want anything from her (and some other shit-talking). Okay, I understand, but she was rude to me. I was just being the middle-person (like always), if you have beef, give it to someone else. You fuck-face; I do favors for you left and right and now you think you can walk all over me, call me up for more favors out of no-where, ask me to drop everything I'm doing and then be rude to my face. If you didn't want them, you could've been nice, taken them, then drop them off at a goodwill. Don't get me wrong though, I love seeing Kaylin, but the only time I do see her is when she's dished to me for a favor. I'm 16, sometimes you can tell, sometimes you can't. I suppose you can't really tell reading my blog, mostly because I let myself go here. I mean, my childishness comes up, and so does my anger.
