      so recently me and damon have been having a "buff up" competition. not only because our stoning lifestyle happnes to be very laid-back but because we also want to be buff. now i know this may seem silly or very gay. but i can assure you it is for purly manly reasons only. so as ive been taking it more and more seriosuly i have made room for a home gym in the garage. bought wights, lots of weights, changed my diet completely and now i have some electronic gizmo that is supposed to tone and excercise my muscles. but the downfall of this little toy is that it really hurts. so off i go now to hurt myslf sommor in the name of dela sexiness. oh and OWWWWWWW!

      so today was englnd euro 2004 match against sewden or something silly. so wht did i do rather than pop down to the local and grab some of the action there i went to see a movie. oh the laughs you can have by being the only 2 people in the whole cinema, its amazing. joke of the night being, as we left the cinema a proud supporter in his game uniform looking like a prick hurling abuse at us for not watching the gm or supporting our country. 2 idea popped into our heads. one being throw a bike at him, or two yell abuse back. i suppose us supporting his face seems like a far fetched idea to you. but belive me his face was a rape scene and deserves every ounce of support we can muster.goodnight and WORD love trilby

      enjoying myself. not the first thing you alley cats out there would want to here me say. but its not tht kind of enjoyment. woke up at 11, got stoned,and realised i never have to go to school again. long gone are the days of the jocks and their trophy girlfriends. long gone are the days when id have to sneak out for a lig and pretend to be going to get coursework. and now i can hate pretty much everyone in the year and not have to care.this is the best thing ever.so now i can wake up at 11. not go to school and smoke all day long. what a great life i lead. now all i have to worry about is running out of herbs and not getting paid soon enough. word trilby

      This has been bothering me for some time now. sat in damons lounge passing the famous jay a long and tiring chat over what to dunk in our tea started. two choics came up. jaffa cakes and kit kats. and the question is, at what point can a snack that can be dunked in milk or good old tea be called a biscuit. we all know that jaffa cakes are not a biscuit even though they claim on the packaging that it is. its far to spongey, not enough crispiness or crunchiness to be a real biccie. the point of this is where would YOU place a kit kat? would it be a chocolate or a biscuit. i for one firmly believe the snack in question is by all means a biscuit. there is no way in hell it belongs in the fridge next to the snickers or yorkies. i feel that if you are the type of person that decides to eat the kit kat as a chocolate and not the biscuit it so rightly deserves to be then you are infact a dick. ROARAHAHHAHAHA! word trilby

      just to let you all know tht i cant post as much as id like to because i might be getting thrown out of home. father is very unimpressed with the grinder he found and does not like my attitude towards giving up smoking dope. ive been threatened to have my face beaten in with a basball bat and my room turned over, scoured in and out to find drug related substances and othr such crap. so what im basically saying is the whole "life" malarky i very hard at the moment and not exactly as enjoyble as it used to be. so adios until next time and have fun skating filming listning to third eye blind and maybe even skining up the odd jay. word Raab

      Now I can easily see that the name for this post seems far worse than the actual reality of it, now that's nothing to worry about. See the point of this "rant" is that this blog is much more effort than I previously thought. It takes a lot of time to think of rants and then a solution to them. Now this is blatantly just a rant that I thought of to complain about rants. The answer to this would be to never rant again, and I don't want to not do that. So I cant solve this rant. Once again my thoughts confuse me. I'm going camping again on Sunday till whenever I don't know. It works out at just over Â£1 for a night so I could be away for a long time. Enjoy your weekend, don't go shooting out the back windows of any cars like the bastards around my area do to me, and yeah. Whatever enjoy trilby

      lessons ive learnt, places ive been, people ive loved. its all bollocks. why is everyone growing up so fast. now i know this may seem like a very silly question to ask. most likely to be explained by my age and the frustrations that come with it. but like most people i prefer to think that i am more mature than other people. but thats the problem. see what im trying to say here is i dont like how everyone wants to look 25 and go rave the night away. now theres nothing wrong with a bike ride and a visit to the sandpit everynow and then is there? off you go now, listen to some five iron frenzy.
