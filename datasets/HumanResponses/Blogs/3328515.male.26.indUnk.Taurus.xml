      Damn, getting old sucks.  And you never thought it would happen to you either.  Did you?  For girls, it’s great until you’re about 23, then the Big Macs get a little harder to work off, gravity starts taking it’s toll, you start wondering, “Hmm… maybe I should have used some of that SPF 30 instead of SPF -15 tanning oil.” as you assure yourself that the bags under your eyes are just stress.  For guys, the years can be a little kinder.  You can grow manly and even distinguished into your late 30’s.  But there’s a little catch- baldness.  It’s like God’s little way of saying, “Hey, let’s see you try and get laid  now !”  Just when you get the acne to fade and he tempts you with one good year of looking relatively normal, you get backhanded with a receding hairline.  And just in time for the old 10-year high school re-union mind you.  Coincidence?  I think not.    Then you have the choice of denial with hair products and pills that don’t work, egomania and poverty with a $50,000 hair transplant, or acceptance with the comb-over of the new millenium- the shaved head.  Somehow I think that women have caught on to the fact that the shaving of the head isn’t due to a Michael Jordan fetish or a Buddhist conversion, although now that I think of it, if you wore those orange robes around town, it just might work.  Luckily, like so many other people in the world, I have risen above the physical and see only the inner beauty.  No... not really.  The fact of the matter is that in 20 years, some Chinese scientist is going to invent some nano-bot which bolsters your immune system and extends the human life span 60 years.  Then, when I’m 130, some 100-year old biologist (don’t forget the retirement age is now 120) will figure out a way to halt aging in cells, extending life span indefinitely.  The best part is that I’ll  still  be bald and ancient.  Our only hope is that the trend of extreme makeovers and drive-thru botox clinics become so advanced and so prevalent that they are covered- no, mandated- by your health insurance company. Until then we can only wait, pray, bathe regularly in SPF 45, and, of course, get older.  As a footnote to all the lovely internet ladies out there, I'm not bald yet, so you can still get me while the getting is good.  What the hell am I talking about?  At best I'll get the genes from my Mom's side where all my uncles have hairlines like Count Chocula.  Then, of course, there is my Dad's side.  I'm fucked.
