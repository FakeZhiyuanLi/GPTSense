      One month of intensive training is over and honestly I'm pretty scared. I may manage to get good scores in my exams but I wonder if I'll be able to put to use what I learned.  And when I manage to do that, I wonder how long would I last in my job.  It's a neverending process actually.  But I want to stop wondering and being scared even if a little fear is good for the soul. It makes me feel paralyzed.

      Remind me not to have a long talk with my best bud on the phone before you leave work. I'm almost late because of that, though it was fun talking to her since it's been a while since we chatted and I kinda miss her.  But if it means panicking over if you're late or not...maybe i should choose when to call her up.

I&nbsp;have a new job,&nbsp;new set of co-workers,&nbsp;new challenges and hopefully a new love life?! Hahahaha!&nbsp;   So here's to my new life!

      Controlling anger is one of the most difficult things I experience in my life. Especially if the type of anger is something that makes your heart beat faster than usual making your chest constrict with pain. Then later on, you feel like destroying everything in sight.  Today is one of those days where my rage surfaced. It hurts still despite my friends distracting me, making me laugh. It was really trivial, but most of our anger comes from little things.  My temper is something like of an H-bomb, it explodes rapidly and ends just as rapidly.  But the damage is done, it's too late to take it back.  Because of this, I hurt so many people.  I have a long way to go to manage my anger. A very, very long way......

      I am so ticked off and nervous today.  We're doing some mock calls and honestly, it's driving me crazy!  Shift's almost over and I still didn't get to have my turn (makes me wonder if that's a good thing or not).   Oh well, tomorrow's another day and let's see what happens.  But man, am I nervous!  This job is a sign of staring over again and I hate to ruin it by making mistakes.  Though I'd rather make mistakes now than do it by next week at least by then if I ever screw things up on the floor, it'll be minimal.  Good luck to all of us or in Japanese... Gambatte, minna!
