       "Groove is in the heart..."   Is potentially the best song ever. Dee Light rocks. She's turned up full blast at work. The same work where the ladies in payroll, who are my moms away from mom, tell me it sounds like I'm listening to reggae everytime they come back to my little office (which isn't really an office, but there is no cubicle, thank God). Really I'm listening to some lame soft rock station that's on some satanic continuous loop of five pop songs. It's maddening, yet I don't dare mess with the already fickle reception.   No management in the house results in donuts, music and the girls in staffing dancing to a Christmas song at their desks. It's mid-November. Too early for this.    The Onion  calendar on my desk says "Tearful Hitler Promises to 'Give Peace a Chance.'" Whatever.   I'm just happy it's Friday and I have a ripe banana.

       God's Camcorder   Last interview of the day, 180 degrees from yesterday:  I should've known interviewing Michael was going to be interesting. When I asked him if he knew his name in Hebrew meant "One Like God?" he answered he did, and "I ain't God." When asked to tell me something interesting about himself that wasn't on his application, Mike said, "I can't split water neither."   So off to a biblical start, we pushed onward.   Come to find out, Michael has a pesky habit of videotaping past supervisors sleeping on the job. Smart move if you do the same thing, which Michael did.   I asked Michael if he could leave his camcorder home if we sent him on assignment.   He just smiled.

      This month's favorite writer writes:    "...Grief ends up giving you the two best things: softness and illumination."  Anne Lamott,  Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith   These two best things were in quiet abundance in my last interview of the day.   L. was initially stoic, almost grumpy. Long face, long blonde hair. She's a delivery driver. Has been for the past 9 years. She didn't volunteer much information. I didn't want to hear myself talk. So I sat still, took a deep breath and asked her how she found herself delivery driving.  "My husband." He died two years ago. Together for 20. She sat still after volunteering this. "I lost 13 family members that year." I changed the subject to her past employment reincarnation as a seamstress. I couldn't handle 13 loved ones gone. 730 days is not that long. I kept wondering how 13 people die in one year, but I didn't ask.   Instead, I asked her how to make a quilt. Seemed like a safer question. Patience, she said. It takes lots of patience to make a quilt.   And persistence.   Those two things will get you through it all, she said.   I'm still not convinced I can make a quilt.

      Things not to tell a potential employer...  *You have several warrants out for your arrest. They are not for traffic tickets. Good news: They are not felonies.  *"My wife is always getting me in trouble." Read: Assault & battery charges for abusing said troublesome wife. Um, who's getting who in trouble?  *You haven't worked in the past 11 years. You've hopped from friend's couch to friend's couch making wooden incense burners for a living. You see nothing wrong with this artistic wandering. Today, though, you're ready to "make a life" and get a job.   Best long-term goal of yesterday's interviewees:  *To do web development for Heart or Van Halen. I think the timing's off, but the idea's interesting. Maybe she could bring some incense burners for her rock-and-roll idols.  Worst person to get stuck behind while rushing to work:  *Lou, the 80-something telemarketer for a neighboring attorney in this office complex who square dances with married men at the American Legion, likes to tell dirty jokes when I'm covering the phones and brakes through green lights.

      On Saturday at a knitting-cool friend's finger-food party a guitar-playing, Beatles-loving friend suggested I do this. I scrunched up my face and then asked why. "It'd be interesting." I assured him it would not. What would I write about?   Your life.   Too broad.   What about others' lives, I ask? I'm better at that...other people's lives.  ***  I interview the unemployed at a staffing agency. I meet characters everyday. People don't believe my stories about the administrative assistant who brokered an art sale to the Louvre or the professional bull rider from Mexico who wants a packing job or the breast puller from a major poultry plant who doesn't laugh at his job title. Pulling chickens apart is tough, nasty work.  I sit across the table from jobseekers everyday and I learn something new. I learn that I have two degrees that mean squat. I learn that until now I haven't taken any true steps for working for myself.   I learn that I want to share this because maybe it's not so uninteresting after all.

      Thursday I survived a flu-like haze, surrounded by used tissues and Good Earth Original tea bags. I am alive!  I can kind of breath. My left nostril runs consistently. Why? I do not know. My doctor should tell me today at 1:30 p.m.  I am one of those co-workers other co-workers curse. I come to work sick.   I shot myself in the foot yesterday by referring a really cool, super talented lady to a job I've applied for (yes, I would like to trade temporary wisdom for family literacy wisdom). She'll get the job, this woman. She's had over 20 years in literacy and a Masters.   But I felt good about telling her. I felt like there's a reason people's paths intersect somedays. I'm new-agey like that.

       Courtney Love Gone Corporate   I have a cold. Blogger advises (generally anyone writing about their workplace) me not lose my job over this. I agree.   So let me explain my intentions.   I write about the people I meet/interview not to mock them, but to describe who/what I deal with on a daily basis. I'm in shock that I'm fortunate enough to meet the characters who are responsible for my stories. Most of the people I meet are "normal," but it's those loveable odd balls that tug at my heart...  ...that make me happy to be human and present and observant enough to notice that they matter, this moment matters and even though I have a huge hole in my tights above my right knee and several co-workers who taunt me about an inadvertantly revealing blouse that prompts one to ask where I got my "job" done, that the 5 o'clock whistle will blow, I will take this ridiculously trampy outfit off and I will go home.   And when my work day ends, I want to know what I've done today that involves working for me. I want to know what stories I've sown besides the ones I'm paid to listen to on someone else's dime.   I want to know when the real work starts (when I go home), how I'll use my time and energy and talent.   These stories are just reminders (for me, maybe you) not to let dreams die. Work for them. Live for them.   But, for crying outloud, make 'em happen.

       Am I Mary Tyler Moore post-modern?    I woke up at 4:30 a.m. wondering this. I think I'm self-absorbed and highly retro, yet entertaining.   Today found me on the Kansas side interviewing, eating too many frosted animal crackers (they're more addictive than Al Green, provided you're addicted to a Memphis-based Soul Reverend like me. I'm sure some of you were conceived to him. Don't deny your love!) and ushering one applicant through three doors to get him to understand the interview was **OVER.**  I was locking the door mid-sentence through a story about how he rubbed a Las Vegas slot machine for him mama and won $275,000. Great, just great, I tell him.  Sure, he was interesting, but I learned how he met his first wife, then his second wife, that he drinks red wine with club sandwiches, how he finagled 30 gallons of day-glo yellow paint for his commanding officer in the Army by bartering blankets not on the purchase order books (He doesn't tell his secrets, he explained in the interview, except to me, I guess. And he never told me what the paint was for!), that he'd like to work in HR although his last job was supervising mall trash (Think big. I admire that.), his casino preferences, that he dated some DJ from some local radio station (Like I care!), that he just had an angioplasty (four stints) and he speaks conversational Korean.   TMI times 5!   Speaking of Reverend Green, I met him if he'd joined the Army (what's up with all the former military men I'm meeting?) and lived in Munich for 23 years and picked up an electric guitar. German Green thinks the Rhinelanders are a little uptight, drive too fast (damn Autobahn), yet have really good beer that cures hang-overs. I got a lesson on German beer at 11 a.m. No fair.   My worst attempt at small talk  ever  to an applicant originally from Madagascar: "Oh, I heard something really interesting about your country on NPR."  Oh....my....God.  P.S. I forgot to include Willa Cather in my list of rockin' writers I want to be like. If I could be a fictitious character I would want to be Antonia. I'm from the Midwest, so that's working for me.

       Career Daydreams   My friend Kristin rocks. She gave me a really cool book with a phrase in the title that I used to think was impossible: "Practical Dreamer." So, before I dive into  The Practical Dreamer's Handbook , I thought I'd divulge my deepest, darkest career objectives.   * Diva-in-training : To obtain a sultry lounge singer position where one doesn't fall off her piano,  whose regulars reward her with gerber daisies and dark chocolate and has an awesome wardrobe assistant whose motto is "More Sparkles, Ms. M. More Sparkles."  * Psychedelic pedestrian poet : To aspire to write like Anne Lamott, May Sarton, Tom Robbins, Grace Paley, Dorothy Allison, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sylvia Plath, John Hersey and Brian Andreas. I wouldn't talk about writing, I'd actually write. Revolutionary idea, huh? Stay tuned. I might just make this one happen.   * Over-the-road truckdriver : I've already picked out my handle: showmegirl. I think it's funny and clever, but one of my friends pointed out it could give my co-truckers the wrong idea. Well, those truckers need to focus on the road and quit taking so much meth. I think there's nothing sexier than a woman and 18 wheels. For the record, that stupid country song about chrome sucks. Think alterna-trucker girl, not Heehaw meets yeehaw.

      Today is one of those days I feel tingly just thinking about where I'm headed. I feel very pivitol, very fresh. Very much aware that I need to hunker down and get busy. Weird.   The temporary world is a bit dull this week what with Thanksgiving tomorrow.    So here is my list of thanks for this week:  *I'm thankful to be home and surrounded by loved ones even though I'm searching professionally and personally. A year ago I was really blue in Atlanta. Cool place, cool people, but I need my crazy family and friends somewhat nearby. Emphasis on the somewhat. Now I feel purple. Bright reds, deep blues combine to make an upbeat, colorful girl. *I have some great friends who inspire and move me. They believe in me when I feel pretty poopy/unperky. Believe me, this happens. This list is not all inclusive, but includes Jenna I., Kristin B., Quo E., Aruna J., David A., Benjie H., Nica H., Wendy E., Tia L., Tiffany B., my Carolina cronies, my DC peeps, the Lawrence crowd and my mom, who drives me nuts with love and annoyance some days, but often is my sounding board, kindred spirit and patient listener. *I have my health. This Thanksgiving was the last holiday I spent with my grandmother, Anna Lee. I miss her horribly, but the fork in my heart has been pulled out (I think). Now I feel intense, softened love for her and for my loss. I had some serious grieving to do this year to get to the cool place I'm at now: a diving board where potential's warm waters beckon.   Much love, grub and health to you and yours.   Next entry will be less me-centered, I promise.

       Temps are people too.    Has my blog been unfair exploitation of temporaries? I don't think so. Heck, I came here to be a temp. Look at me now?  All grown up and working FOR the man, the temporary agency. It's indeed temporary temping for this temp.   Today's interesting thought: As I confronted my image in the mirror at 7-something a.m. after my part-time bakery gig and manuevering a rear-wheel drive truck in slushy snow, I wondered why I just didn't marry a military man or a carnie or OTR truck driver. I could travel and write little missives in my purple notebook and be the happy travel-maker.   I tell you why I won't settle for secondhand spousal living: I'm not a parasite. I'm going to put my energy, myself, back out into this wild-wonderful-weird place, like Gordon Parks says (roughly paraphrased and what I painted outside of my dorm room four years ago):  You have to really want to be somebody. You have to pay for your time on this earth.   Just in case you're wondering. Which, I'm sure those few who have told me they read this, they weren't.   But now you know. Now you know.

Period.   For all of you students of Dr. Betty & Creative Process, know that I am indeed a Spiritual Human In Transition. Ha.

       Victory: My truck, 240 lbs. of sandbags over the rear axles, parks victoriously.    Never again will I take for granted the ability to park in my employee parking lot. Never.  I am also not a fan of the cop who put a 48-hour tow notice dayglo orange sticker on my truck window when I parked on a side street. Note: Those things are really hard to get off. Mine's still kind of on, with the dayglo orange part haphazardly picked off. Emphasis on  picked .   It wasn't even an emergency snow route, Dude. Chillout. Check-out the coffee shop on Main Street and breathe deeply. I'll bring you some bread, along with the two guys who came along rescuing me with chains and four-wheel drive. B. in payroll things men troll the streets for girls like me. I'm OK with that then as long as they're saving me and being chivalrous and not seedy.   Leon Russell is in town.    What would I do to hear him?   *Bake him 1,000 cupcakes. Ice each one with a soul- flavored frosting dyed purple with a music note, perhaps, stuck in the middle.   *Make him a t-shirt with my favorite phrase: "Embrace Your Inner Dork..." And then add on the back of said t-shirt, "...& Leon Russell."  *Buy him a Diet Dr. Pepper from the vending machine down the hall and Vanilla Yogurt Bar from the office snack box for every morning he's in town. I'm that generous.   M-wuh, to my devoted readers. M-wuh, m-wuh, m-wuh.

       Why I Love My Boss.    First off all, I am not sucking up. Mr. K doesn't even know how to get on the Internet, but I love him all the same.   Let me count the ways...  1) The Holiday Luncheon is at a renowned Kansas City steak restaurant named after a breed of cattle. I, however, pick salmon. Red meat disgusts me.  Somehow I can see myself catching a fish and killing it, but not a cow. I think I would run from a cow.  In fact, I, the cattleman's daughter, am afraid of cows, bulls, calves & what have you, but I digress. The lunch was wonderful and free.  Free lunch DOES exist, folks.  Mmmm  2) He sometimes let's us go home early and yet on my timesheet it still says 5 p.m. because he says to put it down. Wonderful. That's totally generous.   3) He thinks I'm smart. He's right of course, but it's really nice to have someone agree in such a disagreeing world, you know?   4) He laughs at my jokes. There's something to be said about this, but I think the sound of laughter says more.   5) He knows I'm blowing this popsicle stand soon (relatively) and encourages me to better myself. That's pretty amazing, if you ask me.

       I'm done with Missouri weather.   Who's coming with me to Barbados?    I know I'm a wuss and this is non-temp related and I haven't written in a week, but I don't care. This is the second morning I've been dependent on a kind man with a 4-wheel-drive truck and a chain. I hate rear-wheel drive. I hate psuedo trucks and the real women who claim to drive them.   So, I'm going car shopping. Completely impractical, wrong timing, but it's time to say good-bye to my dear, dear friend Burletta. She's taken me to many wonderful and interesting places, but the snow and ice are not her specialty.   One bit of temp wisdom for you, just to keep this topical and less me-me-me: Um, I can't think of any this morning. But I'm sure it'll come, and then I promise to post it and post it more frequently.   It's been a great week, a week of reading two books in one sitting, but I've been unmotivated work-wise. I discovered a great independent coffee shop and my poetry writing group meeting was cancelled last night due to snow, but I'll be back in January with my free verses and baked goods.  I need a fru-fru drink, coconut-scented suntan lotion and warm weather to feel excited about December. The usual distractions aren't doing it for me. I want sun and vice.

       Why I need Kleenex for my truck...   I've come to accept that not every post is going to include the people I interview because somedays I think I'm more interesting.   This morning I knew I should've stayed in bed. I woke up with a sharp ache in my ears, a constricting of my throat. It's Friday. I should feel jubiliant. Instead, I feel sick.   Largely, I blame my holistic health sister who refuses to treat my nephew's cold. I always catch it. I'm OK with doctors. I think they do a pretty good job usually.   So, my nose is running endlessly. I talk like a cross between Kathleen Turner and James Earl Jones, but it's not sexy or CNN.   I reached an all time low commuting to work. I had to do it. The alternative was my sweater sleeve. I had used the last of my napkin stash in the glove compartment. My nose was threatening to run yet again. I desperately grab in the pockets of my coat. I find an unused feminine napkin.   Furtively, at a stoplight, I blow my nose into it.   I think today couldn't start off any funnier.

       I just ate mint chocolate ice cream for breakfast.  And an apple, for good measure.   Eating ice cream for breakfast, I think, is part of my prescription for not losing your wonder. Dig in some a.m. You'll see what I mean.  I have an interview today for a grant writing assistant position for a women's shelter. Wish me luck. I would love this job. I would feel meaning in what I do. I would be using my writing for good, not evil.   But don't fret, temporary wisdom will still exist.

       A Year in Review   A year ago, on Dec. 23, 2002, I took a dramatic, windshield-plopping-like leap into my present. I think this year was when my childhood officially ended. I can’t pinpoint a seminal moment in 2003, but things changed. Mostly for the better. Others not. But what is, is.  I packed up Burletta (my truck) Beverly Hillbillies’ style, said farewell to Atlanta and Margaret Mitchell’s psuedo tourist-site home and found myself at my own version of Tara, but only in Independence, Mo. The family homestead was no longer really “in the family,” and Yankees had nothing to do with its take-over. I didn’t even get a cool green dress out of the deal. I only had the guest bedroom and pea-green shag carpeting to contemplate: 24 and moved into Mom’s.   It was depressing.   Then I got on with it. Someone I love died. Part of me died with her and then, recently, begun anew. I “dated” a guy I met on-line (which was destined for failure) in March. I lived with my sister and 2-year-old nephew for six disastrous months. Found my own digs in September off a Rockwell-esque town square. I drank too much merlot in Towson, Md. in August and swung drunk on a tree swing encircled by other inebriated writers cheering encouragement and tree-swing navigation tips. I ordered something with whiskey in it to look cool with one of those writers. I choked on my drink. Then Elana drank my drink without flinching. And I think that’s when I realized my new life view.    I want to be able to drink life’s whiskey shots without gagging. Not everything is amaretto sours.  So, like I did for four years in high school, I muttered my own little resolution that I defy anyone to throw disadvantages at. I’ll shoot you down. The debate-girl-glam geek is not dead.    Resolved:  That I will not lose my wonder as I advance toward mystifying “adulthood.”    I hope others join me. The temporary wisdom revolution is coming. Put down your doubt, your killjoy detractors. Let’s have a drink and find a tree swing. It’s not too late.

       Working too hard can give you a heart attack,  you oughta know by now. Who needs a house out in Hackensack?  Is that what you get for your money? And it seems such a waste of time,  if that's what it's all about, Mama, if that's moving up  then I'm movin' out.  I'm movin' out.   Billy Joel's lyrics in  "Movin' Out" (Anthony's Song)    He's so right.  I'm feeling the lyrical push towards something greater. Will I quit my moaning and move forward? Oh, yeah.   Just you see.

       Billy Squire sings that Christmas or whatever you celebrate is a time to say I love you. Here's one ode.    Tea & Matches   If you had a friend, who was in town from her intentional living community adventure, and you were sick and stuffy and she said she would bring you something Sunday  (“Orange Juice, perhaps?” she said), what would you ask her?  If you were me, you would ask her for tea and matches. The great thing about Andra is that she indulges my weird requests. So we drank chai tea amid candles lit by a hot pink Wendy’s Corner Café matchbook. We took a walk that night. We enjoyed each other’s company and I realized how much I miss my friend.   I seem to miss people more when I’m with them. Oddity #56 about me.  She’s the friend I would hang out with in corners at high school parties, refusing to mingle with the hipper, more talkative crowd. Since then we’ve continued to be “antisocial partners in crime.” We’ve rode a Greyhound bus to Phoenix. We took Grandma’s car to Tempe without permission. On the return bus trip I made a 24-hour vow of silence. She witnessed what many don’t believe. We’ve sneaked onto a school playground to swing under the stars. We’ve met each other half way in Chattanooga, she from KC, me from NC. We write each other sporadically. I inspect her homemade purse and handpuppets when she visits. She rifles through my CDs and refrigerator magnets. We’re comfortable in our friendship.  I love her. I wish sometimes she wasn’t against capitalism and she could work and live nearby. But she’s my revolutionary friend. I’m proud of her. I want her to be happy.  I want to hear more stories about neo-hippies dancing to OutKast in trailers in knit clothing. I want more impromptu visits and provisions. I want everyone to do what they believe in. Andra teaches me this everytime.

       Mark my words, 2004 is when I'll explode on the scene.     Cosmo  and  Free Will Astrology  wouldn't lie.   Things are brewing. I'm concocting some of it. The rest is God. Of this, I'm becoming eerily sure.   Don't worry, friends. I'll keep MY year a little less fanatical.   But trust me.   A kick-ass girl is finding her worth (finally).

      A shout-out to my answering machine and those who leave messages:  *Jenna I. - You rock harder than Bob Seger. Seriously, girl.   *Andra E. - Homemade brown velvet purses and Sherman Alexie books. You are my consultant in hip.   *Kristin B. - Knitting muse and Cosmic Bowling partner. Watch for the cool socks I'm gonna wear on Friday night.  *Quo E. - Wanderlusting partner in crime. Tucson isn't too far from LA.   *Reese H. - My 16-year-old brother said "I love you." On a recording. That's amazing.   And of course, my parents and telemarketers and wrong numbers. Though my parents are way better than the latter.

      So it's been a bazillion seconds since I thought to write (here).  I've thought to shut this crazy train down. My goal, with my writing partner Sarah, is at least a page a day toward my first book. Yes, my first. Don't flinch or groan. Don't let me tell you what to do. But have faith. I am (finally) and amazing things are taking flight.   Like I will probably be moving to Tucson in July. Like I'm finally upholstering my hand-me-down couch in aqua blue Oriental print. Like I'm in a Book Club and Poetry Group I didn't go to last night because I was sick. Sick as this 9-to-5 racket that really has little point, merit or meaning in my life. Yes, it pays the bills.  But it doesn't pay my soul and that, my friends, has to change.

       Midnight Black    Yesterday my wonderful Birthday-girl friend Kristin told me to calm down and I spazzed out. I told her not to tell me to calm down as I got farther away from calm. I’m officially sorry. She was right. I was not calm.   I had just gotten back from visiting my grandma’s grave in Collins, Mo. Blink. You’ve just past it. There’s an Amaco where car shows are held on the weekend. And before you get there, you’ll pass Osceola, this great place known for cheese. I bought my loved ones lots – Gouda, farmer’s and something dubbed “smooth & creamy.”   A year ago, yesterday, my grandma died. She was like me, only older and hipper and bolder. She played BINGO with a vengeance. She watched The Weather Channel whenever I left from North Carolina or Georgia to come home. She waited for me in her Confederate blue Lazy-Boy recliner. She noticed me unlike anyone in my life ever has. She was, is, beautiful. I miss her like the flea market in Weaubleau I would beg my granddad to take us to so I could buy jelly bracelets and junk. But it wasn’t junk then. It was something different and special, only I can’t remember what it was I bought there other than the jelly bracelets.   Mostly I cried at the date etched on the black heart-shaped headstone: Jan. 22, 2003. It hasn’t felt like a year. So much has changed. I wrote her a note on the ground until the mud and the rain started seeping through my black dress pants. I arranged a dozen red roses and then clenched my fists and sobbed. It was very cinematic and disturbing. I thought that stuff only happened in movies. I was a parody of grief yesterday. I don’t think I related to anyone.   I felt alone and mourned the passing of someone who always made me feel so warm.   And then I went to the cheese store. Picked out a cheesy sign for Kristin that said: “Beware of Pickpockets & Loose Women.” Sampled pepperoni cheese, surprisingly good. Drove home. Snagged my new hose before finding out I didn’t need to dress up.  And that snag is what made me lose it.   What made me lose my calm.   My grandma would’ve calmed me down. She would’ve helped me through a little tear in midnight black hose. She would’ve helped me see it’s no big thing.   But it is. I miss her.

       Three Wishes (& no, it’s not for more!)     That I would’ve been one of Sting’s students.  I love him. I  would  stand close to him. Just to bug him.    That there’s a youngish Gene-Wilder-meets-John-Cusack guy who would sweep me off my feet.  But he can’t be a jerk like John’s supposed to be in real life. That would suck.    That I’ll write like a female-version of Mark Twain  and then go live in France. Nah, strike that. Italy. Argentina. Iceland, but only in the summer. I definitely want to be read in classes of future Stings.

      As I sit here eating unwashed grapes, unwittingly ingesting pesticides from Chile, I want to share with you how a**-backwards my morning has already been. I'm too embarrassed to type a**. That's how it's going.   Mostly, I put my tights on backwards. I knew I was doing it, but did it anyway. I woke up with 15 minutes to get ready. Putting on tights the right way didn't figure in with my schedule. I grabbed said grapes and out the door.   Then, as I listen to the radio, I realize how scary it is that I get excited when a Steve Winwood, Lionel Richie, Robert Palmer or Hall and Oates' song comes on. I think all of that should've been hyphenated because, you know, it's a compound modifier or something, but screw this self-conscious bit. It's overrated.   Mostly, though, I remember some vague dream I was having before I clutched the alarm clock to my chest after it went off.   It was good, but, of course, weird. What was it?   I can't seem to get enough sleep. I'm lusty for it. I hope I don't have mono.   Oh, yeah. Love advice from my boss:  "Don't worry about rejection. Think of it as sales. If they reject you, it's nothing personal. Get back out there and sell yourself the next day."   Right. Sure. Love = sales.   I don't think I'm going to ever be good at it then.

      I woke up today at a Godly hour as opposed to the ungodly ones I usually wake up at or hit the answering machine time button to see why it is I'm awake. I boiled eggs, toasted sourdough. Drank a Diet Cherry 7up. Read more of Dave Eggers'  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius . Wondered why the heck I'm not writing like him.   Probably because I'm not a man or from Chicago and my parents are both still living. Damnit. (Totally joking; I love my parents. I want them to have long, happy & healthy lives even though, at one time, they made mine misery. For this reason and attitude, I'm pretty sure I'm afraid of having kids.)  But back to the morning. Papers and books litter my living room floor. A little Bernie Mac, a little Vladimir Nabokov, some scribbles from dreams I've had that I'm turning into a story, an unreconciled checking statement. You know. The usual.   What does any of this have to do with temporary wisdom?   I don't know. Probably something like, "She needs to get more organized." Or, "She enjoys solitude while reading and listening to water boil." Or, "She'll trip over the books and papers on her way out the door in 4-degree weather."  Whatever the golden nugget, she's still here. She's still temping. She's still striving for wisdom.   I think that's pretty sexy and funny and weird.

       A Series of Near Misses   Cliched titles are back. So, this blog has devolved from theme to rant. I’m open to this development. I will bring you back to my “career” as stories and direction develop, but in the meantime, let me entertain you with myself. Most of it is related to the temporaryness (word?) of wisdom or the wisdomess of viewing everything as temporary. Hopefully, you follow.    I almost killed myself this morning with the Lean Mean George Foreman Grilling Machine.  The Lean or the Mean or the Foreman may be jumbled, but the point is there was electricity, a flash of light and tongs involved. Brilliant blue-white spark, an instant orb, materialized as I flipped what I was Foremaning (verb? gerund?). I was a conduit of this explosion and then the dishwasher stopped. Did I mention it was already on?  I looked at the fuse box. I had blown a fuse – with my body as the go-between (as I was holding the tongs). My hair was still smooth, but my hands have felt oddly light and wiry all day.    Then, en route to work, I ran a red light.  My brakes didn’t brake. The cop watched me. I pulled over for him, but he didn’t follow. Thank you, Independence police. I forgive you now for the impossibly stuck tow notice you attached to my truck earlier this winter.    Morals of the story : 1. Use the plastic flipper thing George recommends to turn whatever it is you’re grilling. 2. Try pulling over as a defense mechanism. It worked for me. 3. Life should be a whole lot more fun. Do something you love or have always wanted to love now. You might die in a freak accident and that would completely blow.

       Confessions from a Plan-B Life   I sit here before the sun rises listening to Bob Seger because I think this man is singing the soundtrack of my life. There have been other singers, but he's the one (now). Do you guys have this too? Singers/bands that remind you of your life, a time period, a person? I have an extensive collection of this kind of thing, my musical memories.   So Bob's singing about things being still the same. Some things never change.   I would like to expound on that, namely with a message I received on my answering machine on Wed. from a very cool, thoughtful girl. OK, woman. The point is she said she had a job that was perfect for me. I was excited. I didn't have her phone number to return the call, so I called a mutual friend and got the scoop from him.   Education reporter. In Lawrence. Cool people I like live there. Progressive, college atmosphere. People in my cohort. Live music that doesn't suck. Lots of great things.   I say yes. Yes, I will forward my resume, clips and references. Yes, I would be interested. Yes, this sounds great.   I take a bath. Call back and say no.   No, I don't want to be a reporter. No, I am not a journalist. No, I'm not interested in using my degree. No, I don't enjoy it. No, thanks.   With that said, I feel lighter. I feel ready.   And now, now comes the moment of truth, will I act upon this knowledge and quit talking and start doing what I've always known I should do? Yes.   Yes, I will.   Because there are too many times in my life when I've settled. When I've let circumstance drag me away from inner voice and vision. When I fell into situations and let them be my life's default.   That won't happen anymore. Maybe no one will get where I'm going, but for the first time in my life, I'm banking on Plan A. I'm going to make it happen. Might not be pretty (at first). Might take time. There might be no triple axles. But there will be movement.

       Flirting with Felons   Not really, though there was that time that this guy I interviewed held my hand a fraction of a second too long after confessing his crimes to me. It was endearing. I felt very Catholic priest and then let him go without penance or rosary prayers I don't know because I dropped out of my CCD classes in 6th grade. I'm that kind of girl.   But today, OH! today. What I would wish to sever my professional, objective duties to openly ask Christian, the minister's kid, out. Alas! I cannot. I don't even like boys who dye their hair blonde, but he, he was different.   After asking him to take seat while I covered phones for the front-desk ladies, I invited him to look at our  National Geographics  or grab a handful of Hot Tamales.    Kella: "What do you want to be when you grow up?"  Cute Unemployed Guy: "Happy."    Kella: "Anything more specific?"  CUG: "Um, well, I'd like to own a business."  Kella: "Doing what?"  CUG: "I don't know. Selling something."   Can I tell you one of the reasons I LOVE John Cusack, along with the rest of my cohort, is  Say Anything ? Can I tell you this guy was like that, what with his not wanting to buy anything processed or sold, or sell anything bought-processed?   And he wants to be happy.   Man, I want a man like that, only with some aspiration. Am I someone else's happy? I hope so.

       The Anti-Blogger   I hate this thing. It's a love-freaking-hate thing, this blog thing. I don't want to write on it because I want to write stuff that is MEANINGFUL. Then I laugh at my pomposity and try to lighten up and tell you interesting things about my job. But people, let's face it: Temporary Wisdom is  temporary .  And I'm looking for semi-permanent right now.   This is when I get myself in trouble, viewing the world as a checklist of to-dos and to-accomplish. I want to chill out and bake pink-iced cookies and write in my Scooby Doo notebook and be OK with the fact that Ira Glass doesn't want to hear my stories (yet) and that Tucson (U of A) is a freaking bad pen pal because I won't know until the end of the month if I'm in. Like a basketball. Like the mail. Like the middle of a bundt cake pan.   The point is all this mock rage and no where to expend it. So, I'm going to harass my family tonight. The father who takes my kid sister sledding by attaching a rope to the tractor and then being completely surprised when the cows start chasing an 11-year-old on the back of a yellow tobogan. The sister who rides on sleds in pastures. The brother who I'm buying Metallica tickets for because he rocks and I want to rock and dang-it there's only so many times you're 16 and Metallica's in town. You dig?   And they're good people, these folks.  They're a lot like me, which probably explains everything.

       Who picks these ad banner topics?   Why does MY blog have links on the Blogger Banner for Christian relationships and failed relationships? I don't like this, not one bit. HEY! You Blogger hot-shots. CUT IT OUT! I am not a posterchild for FAILED or CHRISTIAN RELATIONSHIPS. Put some links to cool socks or AC/DC or diet vanilla Coke. Anything other than what you're doing to me now.

       "Don't worry, Mom, I met him at a restaurant." -Liz Phair    Things I've Been Hesitating to Tell You, But Decided What the Hay!    1.  I've joined a cult.  Weight Watchers. I'm a loser, baby. It's awesome and kind of embarassing telling you this. Today I met Marilyn. She gained this week, but she wants to write romance novels. And then there was Grace; she's 2 and not in need of weight loss. She scribbled in my 'lil fat notebook. Hey, there is no parallel between weight loss and notebooks, OK!? I lost. Which is good. Then I bought a banana and a fat-free cappucino and ate my 11:30 a.m. brunch in the sun on a park bench watching a grandma, I think, with a little girl who shrieked like Iggy Pop about the colors on a spinning wheel thing. You know the ones your dad or mom or somebody pushed you on when you were little? And the shrieking punk kid laid back and spun. Spun out, hair askew and laughed in the wind and up at the sky. It was beautiful.   2. I walked 2.5 miles today with Rhonda. One mile by myself, then I picked her up. I'm practicing this tool. Men seem to be pretty OK at it. Why not me? Plus, I just want more fun friends and she seemed fun in her sweat pants and church shoes and her little white terrier dog, CC, short for Chunky Chiquita or something Chiquita. We walked the other 1.5 miles together. She looked like she was 27, but she was 40. She told me she was married for 14 years and then found out he was "keeping another woman."  Whoa, I said. I know, she said. We bonded.  Then she told me about this gorgeous man with this gorgeous body whom she fell in love with. "He didn't have any brains," she said, "But I had them for the both of us." They moved to Mexico and then he tried to stab her. Not happily ever after, people. She hitch-hiked back to America in the backs of pick-ups where the Mexican women huddled over her long blonde tresses and covered her up from any further crazy men. "I've had a lot of jobs," she said. "But the one I like the most is being a paralegal." Rhonda gets off on putting liens and levys and shit on people. I grimmaced and then said, "I'm glad you found your calling."  It was an interesting walk today.   3.  Number 3 on my "25 Things to Do in my 25th Year" List was kind of accomplished.  I met this boy Mark at a restaurant. OK. Denny's. Not really a restaurant. I went there for cheap coffee and to write in my pink Scooby Doo notebook. I was mad at the world. "WORLD!" I wrote. "I hate you." Then Mark showed up and pulled up a chair and told me he was a writer too. "What kind of writer?" I said interrogatingly. Sci-fi/fantasy. Oh, brother. One of those guys.  They rank right up there with men who keep pictures of wildlife in their bedrooms. Don't trust these guys. Run!  I dated, and I use this term loosely, two guys like this. It's not a comforting thing looking into the eyes of lions or wolves when you wake up in the morning.   I digress.  The point is, even though this 25-year-old man is into crystals and chicks with names like Ariel, he was kind of sweet and funny and nice. I think I would like to at least have coffee with him. He asked me for my phone number and I actually gave it to him. I'm so bad at this stuff. My mom and sister are really great at it. Me, I feel like I'm at a Sadie Hawkins dance or one of my former students Marcus, who sat at the top bleacher, petrified, the whole middle school dance because his mom made him come.   So, today, today I went to ask Mark out because it's been 2 weeks and he hasn't called. I think he's intimidated by my fearless funk and beauty. Funk as in inner cool, not smell.   But Mark wasn't at the Denny's managing waitresses who know Elvis's birthday and claim they have rock-n-roll in them. He was some place else. John, the guy sweeping near the door, didn't know I was on a mission: TO ASK SOMEONE OUT ON A DATE.   I told him: "John, tell that boy to call me. I mean, look at me! I'm a nice girl, right?"   John, being infinitely smarter than most men, said: "Yes. Definitely."   So, John will tell Mark to call me.   I think I have a long ways to go in the dating department until I graduate to high school forms of flirtation, but I'm learning and trying and putting this beautiful, creative heart out there.

       A Kella-over   Kind of like a make-over or a do-over in four square or make-under for you  JANE  subscribers. We are fixing this girl up and taking her out. Getting her ready for her new chapter in sunny, hot-as-hell Tucson. She is getting her hair cut. I need suggestions. Highlighted too.   I am putting down the Doritos and little heart-shaped sugar cookies and picking up the apples and green beans. I swear. I'm so tired of being the girl with the "pretty face." (insert grandmother's words here)  Argh! There's stuff attached to this face. I'm taking inspiration from this  urlLink lovely  and getting my butt back to the gym. No more winter doldrums to psyche me out. Buck up.   I am decluttering my life. All the crap I carry with me that doesn't serve a function of truth or beauty goes. Good bye. Minimalism, here I come. I'm so tired of trying to find out where stuff is. I'm wasting precious time. The eccentricity of disorganization is so last year. Spring cleaning starts now!   OK. I need a deadline now. I don't work well without them. Haircut and highlight, by mid-March. Sit-ups and walking I've already been doing. Do it some more. Getting my couch FINALLY reupholstered in this awesome turquoise print I bought at Wal-mart of all places, done by April 1st. OK. There will be pictures. Proof.   You will be the judge.  Oh, yeah. Last goal: Get that little feedback, supposedly-easy-to-do thing on my blog. I need your input and support for a cleaner, leaner Kella.

       Things I Realized Today...   1.  I don't know how to flirt.   2.  Doritos leave a horrible aftertaste.   3.  I'm making you read this crap.   4.  Procrastination kills.   5. I don't know what to ask the faculty folks at the U of A who sent me e-mails to ask questions.  Drop me a line urlLink   and tell me what the heck I should ask them. Creativity counts.  6. Fortunes from fortune cookies make much better labels for writing folders than my  little-human-brain attempts at organization.  7. One person I interviewed today thought it was  OK to impersonate her sister in a court of law.  Then she wonders how she ended up with a fraud felony.  8. I have the best of intentions. Surely,  I'm going to hell.   9.  REO Speedwagon still sucks.  I saw them at the Missouri State Fair and they sucked then. Why do people listen to this Midwestern-bred band?  10.  Sometimes you have to go outside and have an air and sun break.  This cooped up office bit is so tiring and blah. I don't need a stupid nicotine stick to soak up the good weather in February.

       Bit-o-wisdoms   1. Work days go by quicker when you realize you're gonna do what you've always wanted to do and finally have to courage to do, say and believe it out loud.  2. Bit-o-honey is the heaviest box of candy at the Nestle factory in St. Louis per a temp who has lifted that heavy-ass stuff. Makes sense don't you think?  3. Any drink advertised as sugar-free, caffeine-free, calorie-free cannot be good. Cherry Limemade flavor will not reverse the above attributes. It'll make it taste like cherry Chloraseptic.   4. The program assistant of your soon-to-be graduate school will address an e-mail to you as Michael. You will not care and then send her a response to her unprompted apology that Viviana can call you whatever she wants; you plan on writing, learning and kicking ass. You wrote that. Kicking ass to a professional. It felt good.   5. The "I Love Lucy" thank you cards you bought at Target on Sunday to send to that big Kansas City publisher won't be needed anymore (for that). But you should buy Lucy if that's what you want. Not being yourself, even in thank you cards, could prove deadly.

      Eleven days later, she speaks.    She speaks of acceptance to the University of Arizona's Creative Nonfiction Writing program.  She speaks of having faith in herself and her vision. She speaks of getting to go to a warmer place. But not because of the people. She's a little scared, OK a lot, of leaving behind her two-year-old nephew who "shoots" her with Twizzler sticks and her mom who is so close by and so patient and stylish and supportive and her crazy holistic health sister who's a talented artist. She paints souls and abstracts of souls and I don't have to look deep into the oil paints to know her art is deep. There are friends here. There are loved ones.   But I don't think I'm going to be homesick again. I have home inside.   I needed to come back, drop down and get low to appreciate this high. And boy, do I appreciate it. I want to walk out of work right now and down to the QuikTrip and buy a vanilla fat-free cappuccino and stand on the curb on the highway like the cowboy in Columbia used to do, directing traffic in his hat with his hands. I want to show them there's another way.   But you've got believe, especially when not too many know what the hell you're doing. It doesn't matter about that. You've got to see it.   Thanks to all of those who helped me see it. Much love. Happy day! Amen.

        "Today Might Be Your Last Chance to Believe in Yourself."   -Shooting Star song lyrics  Today The Beatles spoke of Tucson in their "Get Back to Where You Once Belonged" song. What the heck is that song's name? Adrian, post a comment and tell me OK?     This is what I've thought today, mostly to myself, occasionally outloud:   1. What movie is the line "masking my contempt for the assholes in charge" from?  2. My second interview with the res life system of the U of A went spankily.  3. I think we shouldn't judge love interests on their occupations or proclivities or spelling. Love isn't a Mensa foray. Compatible interests and ambitions, yes. Snobbery about people working for a living? No! 4. I ate a German chocolate cupcake and an orange for lunch. No the former isn't on my diet.  5. Shooting Star is a good band.  6.  urlLink Dave  is my hero. I've loved him from afar now for forever. Read his stuff. He's great and groovy and I want him to write books about his life.  7. I'm going to play Barbies with my 11-year-old sister tonight. It doesn't get much better. We get to have cat fights, walk down cat walks and indulge in heated tyrsts. I'm teaching her all the important stuff.  8. I'm delivering a cupcake to my mom at work today so I need to hurry up on this already.  9. I love Archie Bell & The Drells. I love Texas Funk! Check 'em out. "Tighten Up" is a song we all should rediscover. Johnny "Guitar" Watson is pretty fly too. Put them on my CD wish list.  10. It's Friday and I'm free from the shackles that be.

       The Tao of Being Broke   Once, a friend of mine from North Carolina asked me if I had "a problem." He kept wondering why I never had enough money to hang out with others at their "second homes" and other flights of fancy. I think he thought I was strung out on drugs or gambling or a sex addiction, but no. I was just an idiot in college and VISA was my best, high-interest friend. We spent some time together in London, at book stores, music shops and the like. I was high and Holly Go-Lightly. I even put tuition on one once. Man, I am so dumb. My dad says credit cards are simply mathematical word problems. I was never good at those and now I'm paying through my nose and every other orfice.  I confess this to you because 1) most of you know not to go my route, and 2) so I may discuss the creativity behind the lack of fat, green cash.   So, the dreaded cards I spent too much on are almost paid for. I can see the light and I don't charge jack. I've spent probably double what I initially did. It's my fault, my stupidity. My dad tried to bail me out and I refused. I needed to spend the night in jail, which has happened to be the brunt of this year.   Which brings me to living within my means. Which brings me to pride and vanity and desire. I lust for suede Born shoes and limitless CDs, but, alas, I wear Payless not Prada and check out my tunes at the library and not Amazon. (My whole CD collection was stolen in Atlanta, over a year ago, by a guy who refused to steal the "Best of Hall & Oates" CD. Jerk.)  I spend evenings reading books and crafting bizarre side dishes like parmesan peas. They're actually quite good. I make hand-made Valentine's with squiggly scissors. I go to the $2 theatre and buy friends crazy gifts from Family Dollar. I walk. The fudgesicles at Aldi aren't bad; they're only 2 points in WW-speak and delicious even though I don't know what the heck "quiescently frozen" means. I just sent off a piece to "This American Life" about liking my bizarro, racist neighbors. Don't mistake me; bigots in any flavor suck. But the story has heart, guts and gusto. It has a chance. Meanwhile, I will continue to daydream about Ira Glass and scheme a way to see him when he's in KC on April 20, 2004.   Mostly, being broke makes you put away the flash-in-the-pan distractions and meditate on what is important to you, what you really need. I'm not eschewing money. Hell, no! I love it and I think it's a great thing to have in your life. But, I think I have a clearer vision of what and who's important in my life. If friends ditch me because I can't go out and party, well, I don't know what to say other than enjoy! I'm on a picnic-and-frolick-fun plan. Cliched as it is, a lot of the best things in life are free.  Why I had to learn this the hard way is beyond me. But when I'm filthy rich, I won't forget the lessons of humility my pursestrings taught me. I won't buy crap soley based off of insecurity.

       The Blood Pressure of a 16-year-old   That's what Kathy said to me after taking my BP before I gave blood. She was amazed at my youthful vigor and I was too, quite frankly. This little fact of Kella makes me excited, knowing my heart is ready for first dates and souped-up cars in the body of a 25-year-old woman.   Today, I wanted to give back to this world that has been so generous in giving to me, especially lately. Karma, you know?  Shortly thereafter I fainted.  I felt my stomach drop after she took out the needle. Darkness. A wave of hands. Then I heard voices saying, "Kella. Kella. Kella." RC Cola is the elixir of life. Make no mistake. That and the ambrosia is most certainly those goober-shaped cookies. I ate some Oreos too and then finished the first essay I'm reading by Barbara Kingsolver. I talked to an 8th grade reading teacher. We spoke of the miracles of books and the trials and joys of teaching. She's retiring this year. She's taught for 35 years. Longer than I've been alive.   "Small Wonder" was the title of that essay and I have to tell you: It amazes me that given all our pretenses and so-called complications, we're made of blood and sinew. We bleed and faint, like the goats my dad talked about after I called to tell him what happened. I love that about him, how he calms me with his talk of animal husbandry.   I love so many. I'm thankful for the small wonders in my life, for giving blood and thanks and receiving packaged cookies and teacher wisdom in return. I'll wear my hot pink bandage with pride. I will protest for kindness and humanity. I'm not quite ready to give up on this world. I still want to kindle my magic and strut my stuff.   Thanks to all who make my life so wonderful.  P.S. Next rant will be less gushing and goody-goody. I just felt so moved today, you know?

       The Reality Show that Is My Life   I don't own a TV. This is another blog topic, but the point is that I miss out on all these shows everyone is talking about. So, I have to spend more time being self-centered, or reflective, depending on how you look at it.   I've decided that the Kella-over is in full-swing. The couch I've ditched in a half-butt upholstery effort. Sorry, folks. Especially sorry to Kristin, who bequeathed me this lovely little piece of furniture. I returned the fabric to Wal-mart. It was cute, but I'll be finding another home for her because today I found out I am one of six graduate hall directors at the University of Arizona. I'm in, babies! I have a position I love that will pay for school. $12,000 per semester for out-of-staters. $4,000 per semester for in-staters. In-state it is. God bless the res life staff at the U of A. Thank you, thank you. You won't regret me.   Also, a HUGE THANK YOU to all who volunteered their good names and good cheer as my references. I'm super grateful.   Back to me. Oh, wait. I think I was already talking about me. Man. I should rename this blog: ever-loving talk of Kella. Anyhoo, I'm getting green contact lenses, I'm cutting my hair shoulder-length, I'm getting choppy layers and maybe even some auburn highlights. My boss's daughter is helping me with my new look. She's 18, but she understands I'm 25. I'm not going teeny-bopper. I need to feel and look sunny and buoyant and grad schoolish. Sophisticated chic. Watch out!   Other news: I abstained from my big boss's brownie supply. This is something worth noting. I'm going for a walk. I never had my margarita last night. Alcohol is a depressant and I'm being a cheap skate so I can buy my friend Rhonda a kickass wedding gift for next weekend. My margarita was the library. Go figure.   OK. Devoted readers. All 3 of you. Hit me with some feedback. I'll send you an e-mail in response. I want participants in my celebration. Love you!

       So Lucky   "You're so lucky," my co-worker whispers at the water cooler a couple days ago.   I look at her strangely. Me? Lucky?   "You get to go away to Arizona. You have no husband, no kids, no commitments. You're free."   Free. Me. It's nice. I love it. I take it for granted. I ache when I enter an empty apartment with too many books and undone dishes. Then I do the dishes because I have a dishwasher and anyone who knew me in North Carolina knows I've been washing dishes by hand for two years. Now, I have no excuses. So, I listen to Supertramp and Simon & Garfunkel and scrub away the day.   I don't dirty that many dishes in an evening, the only meal I have at home. I just get lost in books. I write and call people and write some more. I'm petrified. I bake. I pace. Take a bath. Put my laundry away. File my reconciled checking statement away. Light a candle. Blow it out. Go to bed. Hamster-wheel heart slows down in the dark and I finally go to sleep.   I'm excited. I'm in this weird moment where I want to enjoy the present and yet yearn for July and a new place. I wish all my friends could teleport themselves to my apartment when I'm lonely or uninspired or in need of voices outside of the stories inside my head. I want us to sneak out onto the roof, where my tall windows open up to or up to the attic where the crazy kids downstairs sneak into around midnight. I want us to wave sparklers on that roof and play tambourines in that attic. Those crazy kids are like three or five years younger than me.   Why is that so young?   Why do I feel so old?   Is there a folk remedy for feeling more punk rock? My eccentricity and gaudiness isn't saving me. I go to sleep early and park in spots too close to entrances. Where are the tree swings at dusk, the star-gazing on mountains? Why do I feel dumb doing this alone?   So, I am lucky. Very lucky. I have my health, people who love me and Chinese fortune tea. Then why do I yearn for someone to share my mess and stories and quirks with?  Why do I wonder if that whispering co-worker is maybe only envying greener pastures? Sometimes I'm afraid my stories are my children. Sometimes I'm proud. Sometimes I think I think too much and should retire this blog and have a margarita. That sounds good. I think I'll take my own advice. Cheers to you and yours.

       Farewell   I don't know how to start, so this is how I'll do it. Thanks for reading, whoever you are. However, I'm not too keen on this little experiment so much any more. It's been fun, cool, self-promotional and a nice vent to the little thoughts I sometimes have. I think a lot of cool kids are doing it. That rocks. I hope you keep on keepin' on.   However, I'm going to stick to real letters and occasional e-mails. I'm going to try to keep it tangible, largely because I like the tactile.  I like holding on and, lately, letting go.    I only have three months left of being here with my family and a couple friends. I want to suck all that time out like those mongooses (mongeese?) do with snake eggs. (Only I hope no one now thinks of me as a mongoose. Bad simile, bad.)  I'm not nearly as witty as I sometimes wish, or as interesting as I sometimes say. I have a lot of fun ideas and usually fun actualities, but I'm going to leave this very personal sharing spot to the others who do it regularly and with finesse. I will write you all letters instead.   Thanks for listening about fainting spells, a dead grandma, my job, my future, my attempt to ask someone out, my best friend Andra, grief, joy and angst. This is all pretty universal stuff, isn't it? Thanks to Adrian for getting the ball rolling and for the small few who read. I, however, am signing off, over and out. Send me your address and I'll write to you. Ciao bellas.    Kella

       Bail bondsmen love Denny’s.    I know because the summer after my sophomore year of college I worked 70 hours a week, at my 40-hour nepotism internship and my 30-hour serving job at the chain greasy spoon. An Italian bail bondsman hit on me doggedly one night. He had a pompadour and wore a sateen jacket and many gold rings. He kind of looked like Luigi from that Nintendo game I used to play. He kept trying to get me to come home with him. I kept trying to get another server to serve him. How do you let someone down nicely when you want a nice tip? I still don’t know the answer to that question.  Last night, I was revisited by that summer at a Denny’s off Noland Rd. in Independence, Mo. This guy had a silver-gray mullet and self-done tattoos. I think his name is Robert. He gave me his card, but I just shoved it in my backpack when I left at 11 p.m. He was showing off his handcuffs to the wait staff as a precursor to finally sitting down at my table. I knew he was flirting. I never know when men are flirting, yet, it was obvious this man wanted to talk to me. He even mentioned the book I was reading. I was amazed. He was willing to discuss literature. Unfortunately, my guard was down and he sidled into my booth to explain the genesis of his tattoo collection.   “I just looked in the mirror for that one,” Mullet said proudly. I swear it was a self-styled Confederate flag. Then he told me he had no teeth and pushed out his front dentures to prove it. The only man to capture my heart with that move was my granddad. My mother was right: I have picked three of the strangest states to look for love – Missouri, North Carolina and Georgia. I nodded and then he said the scorpion on his right forearm was done professionally though. “Why a scorpion?” “That’s my sign.” Oh, brother, I think. I will have to order the brownie sundae a la mode to cope with this idiot or figure a way to get him up and out of my peaceful little booth – notebook, Precise black ink pens and another Barbara Kingsolver novel. Sugar and chocolate are my heroin. I’m trying not to eat when stressed. It’s sort of working.   Ultimately, Robert’s bail bondsman partner came up, his elderly cousin wore a loud cowboy print dance shirt and a silver, bling-bling set of handcuffs necklace. They both wore cowboy hats and belt buckles. I remember vaguely a wish a month ago to dance with a cowboy at a high school friend’s wedding. I asked the cowboys’ wives and they said no. I told them I wouldn’t run off with their men. I just wanted to dance a two-step with someone wearing pointy shoes. Still, a no.   Now, I know, God is getting back at me somehow. I need to be specific when asking for the cowboys I hope to dance with.   I’m going back to the metrosexual men. I think they might have their teeth nor wear a Confederate flag on their biceps.   At least a girl can dream.

       Why Throwing Away Expectations (Usually) Is a Good Idea...   1)  Free to blog my little heart out and not give a damn about what folks think or shout out  (even though secretly I love that feedback tool so much I think I was basing later enteries on my ego and less on the truth).  2)  Today I went home for lunch and took off my pants and ate my Cream of Wheat with brown sugar and Brummel & Brown in my knee socks and top.  I wasn't doing this to be sexy or crazy. My pants are full of static electricity and I was wearing high heels and I hate high heels. They'll never feel comfortable to me, kind of like thongs. Ugh. You can't eat lunch without pants at work, and so I was happy to be home. If I did declare Tuesdays pantless lunch day, I might make no one happy because I hate shaving, especially my bikini line. I am disgusting and hairy and daring. Get used to it.   3)  You have more fun and more joy in moments where you do as The Beatles would do: Let it be! WWTBD?  Let it be. Let me say it again: LET IT BE. I thought about this today at the stoplight. If I were to get a vanity license plate, what would it say? Something about being or loving or niceness. I'm mean and angry somedays, but I'd like to focus on the cooler parts of Kella.   4)  Listening to country music is about not having expectations.  It's about accepting boot-scooting good times and the Chattahoochee River and crying in your beer.  If you get over the extreme sentimentality of the stuff, it'll become bearable, even enjoyable.  I used to make fun of those who listened to this crap. Now I love this crap and plan on going to Nashville after Tucson to try my hand at songwriting. Why not?  I want my songs on the Grand Ole Opry and I'll invite whomever I damn well please and probably forget to use whomever whenever I call 'em up and tell them to come on down to Nashville to see my band or singer sing my songs.    5)  Expectations are great tools for picking a mate, a car, instructing a student and building a fruitful, civically-minded citzenry, but not always.  So, to hell with what I think, others think. I'm just going to think and be and quit censoring the stuff that goes on in my head and heart and in between.   Get ready! This is gonna be a whole lot of fun.  And Sara H., thank you for your encouragement.

       A Contraband Post from a Cowgirl-in-waiting   (or I Feel Like Cher on her Second Goodbye Tour)   These are some thoughts I had to share today. I think the reason why I'm blogging on the sly and hoping those few who read me won't notice is I hate themes. I know they're necessary, but some of my themes get boring.  Hate job.   Want to escape yet remain close to loving yet dysfunctional family.   No more depressed tirades.   Seek love and affection from non-jerk.   Wish to give love and affection without becoming spastic freak.    Want to quit eating my boss' brownies that he wouldn't eat anyway because he's on the Atkins plan, but technically doesn't know I'm eating.  Mostly, I am a mess. That is the theme. But I feel loveable and funny and pretty in my messes, like playing in a mud puddle before I cared about mascara and men and metabolisms. I'm trying to reclaim this mess from those who like to deconstruct my mess to be 1) right or 2) entertained in a mean way, such as, "At least I'm not like..." or 3) judgmental. I still want to put the "e" in that last word, but the j-school told me no, so...  I want to break out of all that structure and all those boundaries and cut my hair, jog, quit my job and scream at one of my co-workers when she calls me anal retentive. I AM NOT ANAL RETENTIVE! I am sensitive and that crap hurts, so please, if the office police now know what I'm doing when I'm "looking" busy, please don't fire me. My official notice was for July 1, 2004, but still. I need a paycheck until then. I just want the blonde bully to quit hating me for being bookish, ambitious and somewhat abrupt. I've baked you cupcakes. I've fixed your computer. I've tried to be sweet and it's just not working. Let us all be NICE for once and play pretty.    But here's what's been bugging me to write again:   1) Walgreen's says "Algreen's" at the drug store on the corner of Noland Road and 32nd St. I feel like this is a cool reminder to complete one of my cornerstone goals of 25 things to do in my 25th year, i.e., visit Al Green's mecca of a soulful church in Memphis, Tenn.  2) My best friend's hippie boyfriend jumped out of my moving car. I'm still in shock. I'm trying to be forgiving and understanding of such actions, but, honestly, I don't know how.   3) You definitely will freak folks out if you tell them you're depressed. It might even make them run in the opposite direction. I'm OK with that since I'm working on being positive and all that crap. Aren't a lot of us closetly depressed? Let us come out and get on with the business of feeling bright and etheral.   And with that, the corpse that is temporary wisdom makes her resurrection move, kind of appropriate the Monday after Easter, doncha think?

       Communal Custard & The Japanese Macaque   Unlike most teenaged girls, I hung posters of a different sort of primate on my bedroom walls. I dreamed of orangutans and Pygmie chimps and Japanese macaques. The latter little monkey was the apple of my eye. I found a poster of him after my freshman year of college holding a snow ball. He was sable colored with these huge brown eyes and he seemed so impish and intelligent and wild and domesticated in that moment. So I bought the poster and added it to my Fab Four and teddy bear decorations.   I envisioned myself as Jane Goodall or Margaret Mead. Somehow, the macaque belonged in my room and me with him. It was a pretty cool, low-maintenance room decor relationship. Not many understood my love of monkeys.   So, imagine my surprise when I found my little monkey in a storage facility last Saturday, still in his frame, still holding his snow ball and still watching that photographer with bemusement. I keep thinking that monkey might have hurled that snow ball at the photog after the shot was taken. Something like that.   Luckily, for the monkey and me, I was en route to my best friend Jenna's in Columbia, Mo. Her boyfriend Ed, who is a cross between Bob Newhart and Ed Norton, was having a yard sale. I had no more need for the Japanese Macaque. I had grown out of that poster, but not the monkey.   I didn't want to throw him away.   So the bet was postulated by Ed: I bet you can't sell that poster for a quarter.  You're on.  You're so losing.  You're so wrong.  And because I'm a righteous sort, I went on sell mode to every buyer who passed that yard. I asked the girl who bought the bike without even riding it for $75 if she'd buy my monkey. Um, no. Ed then scolded me for scaring away yard salers. Sheesh. Right! Like I scare away people who go through other people's crap in a home they've never visited. Um, no.   But then I found my mark.   "Oh, what a cute picture," he managed. He was kind of disheveled. I don't know how hair styles and monkey loving correspond, but some how, in this story, they do.   He was wearing one of those tank tops that scoop way lower than they ever should on the undertoned. Man boob galore. He had a sweet smile though, despite the hair and the flesh. He bought a lot of other stuff and yet the Japanese Macaque wasn't moving.   I closed in.  "Are you sure you couldn't use this little monkey some where?"   "Well... It is really cool. Oh, what the hell. I'll take it!"  Yes. I glare at Ed. He tries to look sad, but inwardly he's laughing because my best friend's boyfriend has got me selling his yard sale like the monkey I'm peddling.   Japanese Macaque disappears under the ample arm of the kind man. I wonder where this monkey is now and what he looks over. No longer a teenaged girl in love with, who I believe to be, our animal ancestors, but a middle-aged man who finds such creatures cool.   After the sale, we sold a lot more. We all got our money, but there was $10 extra. We took the dough as a sign that we needed that money for communal frozen custard. It was great fun, frozen confections and talking about my monkey.  I'd like to think he was partially responsible for our fruitful yard sale.   I will miss him dearly.

       The 9-minute Blog   At FARC, I was a member of 8-minute abs. It didn't really work even though Jon Abrahams tried to motivate my mid-section. I love ice cream and sleeping in way more than crunches. And so now, I bring you the 9-minute blog. I will write until the library computer kicks my procrastinating booty off and then I will go run my mile in my fun new New Balance shoes (lots of newness for you!) and then go see Three Dog Night at the Barney Allis Plaza and wish there was some way not to feel lonely in your home town.   I have a new haircut to go along with my new shoes. I watched Kill Bill yesterday. There was a lot of blood. I got a ticket for turning left on Broadway from JC Nichols. U-oh. Time is up.   Wait for Monday. Until then, much love to you all. Tell me it's going to be OK. Tell me I'm weird. Shoot, just tell me something interesting.

       In a Land of Spoof, I Long for Complexity   I wrote about working in a bakery for a year. My writers group said this: "Kella, was your boss really that bad? Wasn't there something redeeming about him? Anything? I mean, come on. He wasn't  really  that evil, was he?"    Honestly, I thought, yes, but I understood their point: people are more complex than good or bad, happy or sad, horny or lonely.  There's a continuum in human nature, if you believe in such a thing.    I'm feeling the geographic aftershocks of a weird dichotomy absent of any gradient of complexity and contrast that many seem to keep alive on the East and West coasts in their parodies of the Midwest and the folks who live here.   It goes something like this: in  The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing , the book jacket exclaims "women from Manhattan and the Midwest are finding the same thing - this is great book!" (not actual quote, but you get the idea...), pols and newspapers throw out the Nixon-era idea of "how will it play in Peoria?" and my favorite magazine in the whole wide world ( The New Yorker ), calls where I live "fly-over space." Excuse me?   These weirdly misguided ideas people seem to have about where I'm from came home to roost this summer at the Harry S. Truman Post Office. I argued with a woman from Alaska who insisted on calling my home "this godforsaken place." I was quiet, as was the rest of the line. She kept going on and on and because I'm no martyr in manners, I said something.  "You can get back into your over-heated Toyota with your heat-stroked dog, head back to cool Alaska and there will be no problems or complaints from me."   Her jaw dropped and others squirmed uncomfortably in the line, but one man grinned. I'd like to think he agreed with me, even if I was rude. Then she back-tracked, apologized, sent off whatever the heck she was sending (probably postcards detailing what hell looks like...) and scampered off in her "Meet me in St. Louis" t-shirt.   Admittedly, I have called this state Misery. I have bad-mouthed it to my friends and strangers, but this is MY home. It's kind of like your family. You may want to join the Witness Relocation program, but you know that if any one else suggests the idea, you'll be mad. I know. My family is strange and weird and warped, but underneath there is love. I know.   And this is how I feel about Missouri, not Missour-ah. We do not call it Mississi-pah. I am no official state ambassador or beauty queen, but I was born and raised here. There's a lot more to us than what you read, so beware the messenger.   I drive a red truck with a bumper sticker proclaiming "real women" drive 'em, but I also jam out to Ani Difranco, Lauryn Hill, Al Green, Bach, Patsy Cline and Groove Armada on the highway. I feed Baby, my father's little black calf, but don't eat red meat. I want red cowboy boots one day in my closet, but I also own a key-lime iBook. There's a lot more to me, to all of us, than meets the eye.    If folks quit flying over, using the Midwest to be the yin to Manhattan's yang and pols started caring about how their policies affect the WHOLE nation, I think, finally, we might start getting some where in this crazy land of over-simplified spoof.

       Unlike most women, I don’t fantasize about the dress  or the reception or the presents or the honeymoon when someone says WEDDING. Of course, I have a hazy picture of a man, but save me the blush and bashful bridal colors in  Steel Magnolias .  I think about the play list. You know. The songs I’ll play when I walk down the aisle, when the ceremony is over, when the reception begins and the funky chicken ends it. I think about the songs I associate with true love and my life. Starting today, I am compiling all the songs that I want to play during my wedding. If I don’t get married, then I’ll have a party and play them just the same. Y’all are invited.   “Maybe I’m Amazed,” Paul McCartney “She’s Not a Lady; She’s My Wife,” Lyle Lovett “Her Strut,” Bob Seger “Love & Happiness,” Al Green “Groove is in the Heart,’ DeeLite “Ring of Fire,” Johnny Cash “A Case of You,” Joni Mitchell “Hard-headed Woman,” Cat Stevens “I Touch Myself,” The Divynls “Crazy,” Patsy Cline “Right Down the Line,” Jerry Rafferty “Like A Prayer,” Madonna “Where Would I Be? (Without Your Love)” Cake “Beautiful Day,” U2

       What I’ve Taught My 2-year-old Nephew:  Hills should be rolled down. If you lick your finger, sugar will stick to it.  Libraries are amazing places, even if Trent once put a choke-hold on a fellow toddler at reading time because Trent couldn’t have the felt motorcycle on the storyboard.  Lala’s gingersnaps are not evil, contrary to what his mother says. Yogurt is also good, contrary to the faces his mama makes when we eat it.  You don’t need a TV to have a good time.  Slides are not scary when someone holds your hand that first time up.  Play dough doesn’t taste good.  Quarters can become eyes when you squint your eye socket around them.  Green eggs and ham the book and the food items are equally good.  Grocery store aisles are good places to run.  Dog poop stinks; try not to step in it at the park.  How to get truck drivers to honk.  Lights out when you are sleepy.  Make sure those around you know they are loved.     What Trent’s Taught Me:  The art of running hugs. The forgotten fun of sheet and blanket tents.  Chase is a great game and viable exercise. My real name is Lala and I like it.  You can never have too many quarters.  Ask when you need to be picked up.  Keep phone calls short and sweet. Come on over instead. If you’re having fun, bed times are meant to be broken.  To use please and thank you and air kisses more often with strangers.  Be honest without being mean.  Find out where freight trains go.  Teletubbies aren’t that bad. Really.  Big yellow school buses are what Trent wants to ride right now. Get up when it’s day time.  Dandelions are flowers.  Bath toys and bath foam are essential to proper hygiene.  Chicken nuggets should be eaten with sound effects.  My car radio should be fixed regardless of my lame excuse of having no money because Trent offered me a penny to get it done.  Flight of the Bumble Bee  should be danced to. Every day is good day for finger paint.  I will not be bored watching  Finding Nemo  for the 20th time.  He likes to drive on gravel roads and Target parking lots and understands how the key starts the ignition.  All cars are Jeeps. All Jeeps are his.  The best kiss I ever had (thus far) was when I pretended to be asleep at nap time last summer. I felt a small hand on my back and then the soft kiss of a toddler trying not to wake me up as he kissed me and then rolled over.

       Just so you know...   There's an advertisement for "John Steinbeck Books" above my page. I think that's beautiful: my lust for  East of Eden  (which I finished this morning..."Timshel, people. Timshel.") is now getting people to read a master. Do they make men like Steinbeck any more? Do they make women who LOVE Steinbeck any more? I just don't know.   What I do know is that I e-mailed Babu. Could be a mistake, but I won't know until I choose, you dig? I ate M&Ms instead of ran last night. Didn't feel so great about that this morning. Will choose to walk and run TODAY. Shaved my legs. This is monumental. They are too long and hairy and damnit, I want to be lasered. One day, when my book royalties start coming in, this is what I'll do. Screw foies gras and champagne. I don't even really know what foies gras is or if I'm spelling it correctly. I just know it's what rich people eat. Right? Right.   Mostly, I need to quit procrastinating. I've written 11 good pages this week on a story, but I've only worked through the complication and the first development point. Two more developments to go and a resolution. Man, woman, I'm lazy. How do you jump-start a girl like me?   Hmm. That could be today's list!!! Yay, for stream-of-consciousness!   What Turns Me On   by the unbashful Kella  *epic books and poems and songs by epic people *spring picnics with good cheese and semi-sweet wine on an old blanket *the smell of sweat; I know, it's weird. *guys who still wear Converse in their 20s and beyond *girls who are strong and kind like seatbelts *Leonard Cohen, Ben Harper, Janis Joplin, Loretta Lynn & Nina Simone *Always Al Green *black comedies *mix tapes *library stacks at major universities *sunsets in the mountains *campfires and S'mores all over missed mouths *road trips to no where *opera singers *May Sarton's poetry *cobblestone streets *college basketball *endorphins after a run *soft lips and sure hands *the Anais Nin book I bought in London and read furtively on the plane back home, blushing and coveting the ecstasy of the written word *walking home in the dark *waking up with the windows opened *holding hands until you know the sure geography of the palm that touches yours *vulnerability and brilliance in a time of unrest and darkness

       All the things I think about when I should be doing something else:  Heart's  Dreamboat Annie  is a must in any CD collection Hot male librarians, um, media specialists When will I clean my bathroom? I am so gross. When will I visit the eye doctor? I am so blind.  Strawberry cake at The Westport Coffeehouse Submitting stuff to  The Washington Post Magazine . Oh my god.  Write thank you to admissions officer at U of A who RESENT my acceptance packet, which got lost in the mail.  Jog 1 mile. Jog 1 mile? I want to eat M&Ms. Writers' group on Sunday. I want to live in  East of Eden  for the rest of my intellectual life. I think John Steinbeck was damn sexy.  Will I e-mail Babu, the engineer my friend Jan demanded me to ask out on a date in Barnes & Noble? I just don't know.  I'm officially on vacation; I have no plans.  Will I bake sugar cookies for Sarah M. like I promised three months ago?  Dry cleaning still at cleaners from November. Think it's still there? Pantless Tuesday Lunches haven't been held in awhile. Maybe again...

       My Surrogate Work Mothers    Here's an ode to the ladies who have put up with my work-place outbursts, 9-to-5 interruptions to tell of dreams and books and boys and always listen, smile and dispense wise, wise words when I need them most.    These are the ladies of payroll and I love them with all my heart. Meet Vicky and Benita. They are my mom's age, and they are my friends. Today, at 3 p.m. I learned our company was under-going a change and that their department would be laid off. That trademark Kella grin stopped and I looked down. I'm leaving here July 1, 2004. I'll be gone, but I don't want my payroll posse gone. I want to write them postcards from Tucson and tell them of my adventures via e-mail.    Why I love Payroll:  Obviously, paychecks Smelling their tupperwared lunches Talking literature and lust Walking with Vicky barefoot down 37th St. on our lunch break Ordering the most expensive meals at our company Christmas dinner Asking them if I was nuts for wanting love and chasing dreams Benita laughing when I told her my next pie-the-sky passion, but still encouraging me to get off my butt and fly Comparing notes on our toddler relatives and how cute they are Entertaining the notion of getting snockered on our lunch break on margaritas across the street Vicky's son's brownies iced with peanut butter frosting Ranting sessions about our dysfunctional work environs Lunch-break philosophizing Telling them first that I was accepted to the University of Arizona Meeting and laughing with them during my interview (over a year ago)! The only people who really listen to me here and make me feel OK

       Required Reading   I think people should come with required reading lists like college courses and then I might have some luck at understanding folks.    Like my sister Jenna, I would tell you to read a lot of Anais Nin, Colette and Tom Robbins. Anything sexy, shocking or mildly hallucinogenic.  I think then you might grow to love her and understand her or at least know when to put the book down when parts get too steamy or crazy or what-have-you (or when to read under the covers with your flashlight).   I’ve been thinking about this a lot since I began reading John Steinbeck’s East of Eden. I’m in love with one of his characters, Samuel Hamilton. He’s Irish, curious, inventive, dark yet happy and I love the way he thinks. I think you should read East of Eden just to meet Sam. I think you’ll fall in love too. I think you’ll cringe at the foreshadowing when you know sweet, smart Sam is inching toward trouble by hanging out with Adam Trask and his no-good wife Cathy. That dame I just don’t dig. So far, I haven’t found any female characters Steinbeck is cuckoo for or sympathetic to here. Hmmm.   Now I’m wondering what would be my required reading?   Here’s a shot at what I think you’d need to read to understand me (more):   To Kill A Mockingbird , Harper Lee  A Midsummer’s Night Dream , Shakespeare  Bastard Out of Carolina , Dorothy Allison Grimm’s Fairy Tales   Insomnia , Stephen King Selected Poems of Gwendolyn Brooks  My Antonia , Willa Cather  Mama Makes Up Her Mind , Bailey White  Me Talk Pretty One Day , David Sedaris  Horton Saves Whoville , Dr. Seuss  I’ll think of many more after this is published. What’s your required reading?

       Pie Crust Remnants   Have you ever loved something so much you forgot about it, only to fall in love with it again, suddenly brand new, while you’re at lunch reading  East of Eden  and talking with Benita from payroll about whether Oprah had Steinbeck on her booklist? That something was made when my mama baked pies. I only know to call them pie crust remnants. They were dipped in cinnamon and sugar and I would eat them after playing in our tree house on our farm in Odessa, Mo. I had a pink eyelet comforter in an attic bedroom and a baby sister and I honestly think that these treats will always remind me of a simpler time. I’m not nostalgic with this memory, but I want to cradle it right now. I want to remember. I think something about memories are powerful and healing and, possibly, universal.   My mom made these little aromatic wonders when she pinched off dough from pie crusts. I had that kind of mother. You know, the stay-at-home goddess until I ventured off to kindergarten at 4. Really I demanded to go to school.  I always had a problem with thinking learning couldn’t take place outside of classrooms.    Boy, has life schooled me on my arrogance and overlooking of “teachable moments” in post offices, at graves, in Denny’s, walking the gravel road from my father’s drive and in my break room at lunch today.   I think this week I’ll make a pie and feed my nephew on my sugary memories.

       Lessons from the Anti-Vacation Vacation    This week I had off - five glorious weekdays all to my gluttonous self, and what did I do?     I worked as a substitute, which is better than other tute-ending professions (by my standards, any hoo, which are by no means universal or moral).    Yesterday was the only day I didn't work and you know what I did already with that free time: slept in, ate cake, wrote, took a nap, saw my 6th grade sister's choral recital, washed three loads of laundry and then collapsed at midnight to find I couldn't sleep.  Somewhere, though, I did, and this morning I woke up at 4:50 a.m. to drive one hour (from my dad's farm) to get to the high school to pretend to know Spanish.   I was in for a big treat. I subbed classes for native speakers AND disinterested high schoolers who seem to be forced by their parents or guidance counselors to take a beautiful language they have very little appreciation for or dedication to. As for the former, they could say bad things about me, but didn't (as far as they told me). The Spanish speakers were my favorite, and, yes, I have favorites.   But now my grueling day is over; I only had an 18-minute lunch, the same time the students got, with NO planning period.  I persuaded William that I did not know the Spanish word for pimp.  Dora bounded around the room using every known adjective to get her way, and I reluctantly, though joyfully, gave it to her.  I became the "sweet, beautiful, sexy substitute," even though later one of them told me I looked like their instructor, who reportedly has a mullet and a big heart.  I hope I'm similar in the latter comparison. I got Jared to actually work on his Spanish II review sheet. Jared didn't actually do work; he merely shaded in flowers at the top of his assignment, but he was seated and in a desk and not distracting others.  I count all of these things as victories for a foreign woman in a Spanish classroom.    I was a dispenser of free time and hall passes to the bathroom, AV room, lockers and God only knows where else. I felt happy with my power. I felt free.  And now that my week of subbing is over, I feel sad.   I don't want to go back to the temp agency for a month and a half. I just want to sub and meet other crazy kids who want to know the "bad" words in a language I butcher hourly with my lack of practice and knowledge. I know now that I want to teach.

       Chocolate Cake & Coffee at Mama's   No substitute teaching on Thursdays. Today is my day. I woke up at 10 a.m. to the rain and an open window and a sense of well-being I haven't felt this fully since I was around mega-watt creative, artsy folks who helped me find myself.   Of course, I'm probably exaggerating, but this is pretty much true. But onto the cake: Mama's is this great little diner-esque joint off 39th Street and Bell. I love the servers. They are cute and tattooed and well-spoken. I love their omlettes and their coffee. I love the corner table by the sage green curtains and my view of the rotating dessert cooler.   Rain streaks the windows and an Italian eatery and bookstore are in view. I read Steinbeck's  The Winter of Our Discontent  and feel a warm, buzzy feeling of contentment. It doesn't get much better than this, is what that feeling says. And it's true.   True enough that I wrote it in my spiral notebook, the one I smeared with chocolate cake in a clumsy manuever to save what I was too stuffed to eat.   But I like that about this notebook. There's brown on the edges of blue-lined, wide-ruled paper and it's from this morning and my random decision to seek out brunch in Kansas City.

       My Least Favorite Grade & Why That Changed Today    Third grade reminds me of some pivotal moments in my life.    1.  I didn't like a teacher.  Namely, my teacher, Mrs. Mitchell, whom we all called Mrs. Bitchell. I don't even know how cute little third graders came up with that, but we did. Up until then, I idolized teachers. After her, I still did, but her presence in my classroom reminded me there are more like her.   2.  Brooke the Bully.  Never was that self-conscious about my looks until kids said, "Move over bacon, here comes Sizzilean." Whatever happened to Sizzilean? Did it die in the grocery store aisles, a silent pork commodity death? Brooke was vicious. She knew how to get the other kids to make fun of me, chase me and knock me down "accidentally."   3.  The gifted program didn't want me.  Let's face it: No gifted program ever wanted me in elementary. It took till high school to be in classes with modifiers like advanced and intense. It always hurt when the other kids got to leave to listen to Bach and solve moral dilemmas such as, "You're on a deserted island and only three of the four people can escape on an amphibious Vespa." I always felt like the sacrificial islander in third grade.  4.  I had to get glasses.  Now, I was slightly chubby and near-sighted. Brooke loved it!  5.  The first school year my parents were divorced.  I left my rural and happy school district for a snobby suburban one. I don't know if I'm being nostalgic or accurate.   Then today, at 10:30 a.m. I got a call at home. I'm on vacation from the temp agency, but I'm subbing this whole week. The school district needed a third grade teacher. I can't do this, I thought, as I listened to the automated message. I can't be Mrs. Bitchell.     But I'm 25. I was in third grade 18 years ago. Eighteen years ago? That's a whole lifetime for some, especially some of the men and women fighting in this war we don't hear much about any more.    I can survive third grade then. I can return to my least favorite grade.   The children were smaller than the third graders I remembered. They watched  Gordy  in a Cartesian spin on the question "Do animals think?" They played  Oregon Tr ail and  Tetris  in the computer lab. Then we asked 20 questions until the bell rang. My heart went with them as the walkers and car riders left first and then, my brethern, the bus riders, left last.   I exorcised a painful year today and yet it still hurts. How can I remember five negative memories when I was so young?   Surely, the girl who loved Beverly Cleary and teachers can return. Surely, we all must face the years we were left behind, if only to remember the years still left.

       Any Given Sunday...   You may find me waiting at the Farmers' Market in Kansas City, trying to find my mom and nephew, sitting on the curb as strange men give me sidelong glances and cheap strawberries continue to waft in the breeze, scent of ripeness ready to turn rotten. I am writing on a piece of scratch paper and people seem to think this is odd, a woman on the curb by the potted plants, not too far from the strawberries, scribbling down what she sees as she gets stood-up, accidentally, by her loved ones. There are tan vendors with greasy creases in their jeans on cell phones, lots of couples who make me wonder if the Farmers' Market is a place only bookends go to, overweight consumers with tiny dogs and purses and yours truly waiting on her curb with her pen and paper. Maybe those who gave the strange or lecherous or curious glances were wondering if I was for sale too.   Everyone has her price, and I think mine would center on the amount of laughter and love yielded with a mutual time, respect and lust investment.  I just pray I'm not like the strawberries. I'd like to think I'm wine or cheese or something that's worth increases exponentially with age and experience.

       Remind me, what did I write about before this?    or, a Continuation in the "Is this a date?" Saga   So, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before Pat shows up to lunch, Dustin starts talking about what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking  more  about finding Dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade.   I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and then silently asked myself: Am I being pawned off to the other guy? Is this what happens now? Am I someone's consolation prize?    And being stupid and paranoid and fragile and not too great at censorship, I leave the bathroom and sit down and then say to Dustin,   "Are you trying to pawn me off on Pat?"  "NO! No. no." Dustin said.  I look down and study my drink and wish there was alcohol in it. Then, Pat ambles in and I'm completely confused.   Fast forward to angst and blog anguish and then to 10:30 p.m. last night.   Phone:   Ring, ring, ring.    Kella:   Hello?    Dustin:   I've been trying to call you, but the phone's been busy.    Kella:   Oh, well, I was talking to a friend (Really friends, Jenna, Jan and Stefani).     Dustin:   You wanna come over to my house? My friends and I are just sitting on my porch.    Kella:   Sure. (pause) OK.     Dustin:   Cool. (address and info given). See you soon.    Phone:   Click.    I'm thinking I'm way too eager, accessible and honest with this guy.  Hard-to-get flashes to my mind like a Memory card that doesn't match the card in my heart and I'm left wondering when you abandon the cat-and-mouse chase or just go with the flow or get more of a life or at least lie about having one.    But, I go over and Dustin is there, and Pat, and two teen-aged girls. (One in college, one freshly graduated from high school. This is weird to me. Weird alarm is ringing. These guys are 23. I'm 25. These girls are firm and quiet and trendy.) I'm clearly the oldest person here. I wear glasses. Bring Woodchuck Pear beer. Know relatively little about  Friends  or  Blink 182  or whatever it is people several years younger talk about. I sit there, drink so-so beer and then panic after everyone leaves and I'm left here, alone, with this strange man. (A place I've chosen to put myself in?)   It's an anticlimatic fear, as we talk in the extiguished-Tiki-torch dark about everything and nothing.  There's silence and the dark and the unknown distance between people who know very little about each other, let alone how to build a bridge or if they even want to get to the other side.   So, he walks me to my car, hugs me and I leave. I return home to Smurf sheets and an open window at 2 a.m. and tell myself to quit trying to figure this out. Some things just are. This might not be, and that's OK.

       Joint Roses & Deja Vu   No, this isn't a drug reference. More like a remembrance of my sophomore year of college when two boys, I shall initial them D. & E., gave me joint custody of a dozen white roses for Valentine's Day. One boy I was madly in love with, the other was just my friend. D., the friendly one, had a hard-core crush on me, so imagine my chagrin when I got roses, yes, from E., the boy I was wildly in everything with, and my friend D. It was a mixture one part sweet, three parts weird.   Why would men go into together on roses for a woman? Does anyone know the answer? I have yet to meet any other girl who has had this happen to her.  Flash forward to the parking lot of an ugly mall in the Midwest this afternoon. I am being escorted by two men, one of whom I like (Dustin), the other his best friend (Pat). I'm being walked from what I thought was a lunch date with Dustin. Lunch was short, especially once Pat arrived. I had no idea he was even coming, though he is a nice and funny guy. I guess the date was done though, because both of them asked to walk me to my truck.   What?  I think I did something wrong, even though I don't know what. I was a knock-out in a pink t-shirt and blue jeans. Nothing stuck in my teeth. Deoderant on. Breath fresh. Listening and laughing and remembering to be myself. Check, check, check.    What happened? Am I that intimidating? Scary? Pink?

       Making Inferences   I had to teach this concept (inferences) to sixth graders for two years. I struggled with it. They did too.    See if you can infer what happened in my life today:     A desk full of dark chocolate minature candy bar wrappers, off-brand Midol, a to-do list still not done at 5:30 p.m., and a sticky touch-tone phone pad next to an empty gas-station cappucino.

       Why We Need to Treat Boys Better   So this is my 69th post. Perhaps an appropriate number for the topic at hand: BOYS! Even when the men my age are "adults," I call them boys. The word hints at fun and being tough and gentle at the same time and my feelings toward those who are a member of this group grows a little bit fonder, less conflicted, warmer, forgiving and loving with each moment I watch my 2-year-old nephew Trenton.   Surely the boys I lusted after, loved, misunderstood, confused and tormented were once so beautiful and innocent. Surely, some still are. I love boys, even though some days I don't know why or how.  Right now, though, I want to throw up. I have butterflies. I'm not sure I can follow through on what I want to do tonight. There's this lanky, funny, smart server guy who works at the neighborhood bar where I do karaoke. He has tousled my hair and agreed to sing Def Leopard's "Pour Some Sugar on Me" with me even though he doesn't sing in public. His name is Dustin and he's a former debate geek like me and I would really like to go out for strawberry cake and a long walk and good talk. He likes alternative music and dislikes Confederate flags. He has his own teeth and no self-made tattoos. He's super skinny and tall and I'm afraid I would crush him if I were to ever kiss him, but I told myself to get over that.   Dustin said he loved strawberry cake. I just so happened to bake such a cake on Saturday.   "You'd eat it even if it's four days old?" I ask.   "Sure," he said. "I would love to."  So here I am, a nervous wreck without her promised cake. I gave the remaining cake away to my best friends.   Plan B: I practice my line to my co-workers today:   "The bad news is I gave all the cake away to my friends. The good news is I know a great place to get some."    Benita says go for it. She wishes she would've done more ballsy stuff in her youth. I laugh. Ballsy! Gee. Um. I'm such a chicken. I talk big. I walk less.   Jesse says go for it, too. She's 19 and home from her first year of college. She helps me smooth my line out to the above one.   I still feel this huge knot below my heart and I don't even know this guy that well. Is this what boys feel when they ask us out?   If so, I'm going to treat them a whole lot nicer. I will bake more strawberry cakes and deliver them to unsuspecting men. Practice random acts of baking and be a little nicer to the guys who risk rejection way more than me.

       Karaoke Videos   Last night was spent drinking way too much Woodchuck beer and singing karaoke at the neighborhood bar with my best friends, Jenna and Stef. A little Tammy Wynette, Joan Jett, The Beatles, Sir Mix-a-lot and Pat Benatar for me. Jenna was partial to The Dixie Chicks' "Sin Wagon" and Dale Evans' "Happy Trails," Stefani to Willie Nelson, Gloria Gaynor and Nancy Sinatra.   We rocked the house, we three babes. We were funny, bawdy and sexy. Smart, silly and slightly inebriated. Grown men were hooting and hollering. All three of them, especially when I decided to sing "Baby Got Back." The bar didn't know what to think at first. This is an old-school, no profanity or "anaconda as phallus reference" type of joint. It took awhile for the hooting and hollering to commence, but when it did, boy howdy, watch out. We were it last night. And some where, every one should feel the itness a dive karaoke bar may bring to your inner diva or Devo.   But as the night wore on, and our voices with it, my friends and I noticed a strange phenomena: The Karaoke Video.   Have you watched these? 'Cause you really should next time. I think all karaoke videos were filmed in the mid-80s and they usually involve a woman getting out of her bathtub, dressing and then hopping on the back of her boyfriend's motorcycle ("I Love Rock 'N Roll") or a young blonde boy with a bowl cut pining after his divorced or dead dad with his emotionally wraught mom looking at pictures (some Willie Nelson song). These videos are a lost art and I think someone, maybe me, should do a visual anthropology project on these things. They're that amusing.   All in all, we three babes woke this morning at 10 a.m. after our karaoke/slumber party affair. I dragged them to Mama's for breakfast (of the chocolate cake & coffee fame) and then said goodbye and thought, as I was driving away, that there are some people in the world who help you feel more alive and more able to do the things you wish in your solitary heart.

       You might not know…  I sound like a voice recording when I answer the telephone at work. I need to break into voice-over work.  I own two pairs of Tinkerbell hipster underwear and I’m 25.  I have crushes easily, but fall in love not so much.  I’m a runner. Two miles today, people!  My little brother's baseball team advanced from Sectionals to Semis today. Go, Reese! Beat Iberia! I befriend older people lots and met Judy last night with my good friend Jan. Judy’s face was tinged pink by all the make-up she wore and she suggests I meet good boys at the Truman Library where she volunteers. Judy to Jan & I: “You two look like good girls.” Damn straight! I am a spy for the Independence, Mo. Democrats. I told them about the Republican Headquarters across the hall from my office. I have the Democrats’ card now and I’ve been urged to call when I find out more.  I am happy at this exact, perfect moment.

       Republican Headquarters...   ...are located across the hall from where I work. Do they know who's across the hall? Me. I'm going in there on my last day of work and ask them what exactly it is they're trying to accomplish. I will not be some born-again conservative either. I don't ally with the donkeys, though I think I see a lot of social issues we tend to agree on. Fiscally, I'm more conservative. You reconcile the two 'cause I sure as heck am not. I yam what I yam.  Any way, word to the 'phants, I'm coming for ya.

       Goal: Run 2 miles without dying by the end of this week.    I run every other day somewhat regularly. This week I'm bumping my mileage up. I bruised my instep at work last Thursday falling face-first into the staffing department after I lost my sandal on the hard plastic mat that allows us to roll our chairs to and fro. I think the instep is better and today I'm running 1.5 miles. Repeat 1.5 miles on Wednesday and then on Friday and Sunday I run 2 miles. I know I can do this, so I'm going to.  I'm telling y'all this to hold myself accountable. I want runner's legs and I want to be able to make chase a really fun pursuit with my nephew Trent.   Yesterday we saw  Shrek 2  and Trent peed on my jean skirt at the park before the movie. He didn't mean to. I was congratulating him on peeing and he turned around to smile. We were outside. Isn't weird that I'm teaching my nephew this?   Kind of feels like my dating experience, that one. No more pissy Kella this week! Yee-haw.

       Reality Bites    Remember that scene in  Reality Bites  when Janeane Garofalo is in the bedroom with that musician from that band that made that video with the kid in the bumblebee suit (see Clare's correction in comments, please) and they’re sitting on her bed? Janeane is telling Winona about her parents and how her mom goes to the bathroom with the door open and this is why Janeane won’t get married. And then that singer guy says something stupid and J. gives the camera this look, like, “Whoa. This dude is so, so dumb. I can’t believe him!”   Well, I didn’t sleep with anyone like Janeane does gratuitously in the movie and my bases have definitely not been rounded, but I’m getting this feeling with the Strawberry Cake guy. I invited him to come with me to The Brick to see Sarah play and he, of course, brought his friend Pat. Pat even called me to confirm. I’m dating Fric & Frac. This has got to stop.   Men, do you have your best friends return a woman’s phone call? I think not.   I think these guys are usually really sweet and cool, but oh-so immature and kind of cultish sometimes. How can two years make such a difference? It shouldn’t, even though I am cultivating a silver streak in the front of my hair like that comic book character, but it does.  As soon as Sarah left for the stage to rock out, I was alone with these guys and I just felt strange. They were like hyenas circling around prey and I’m not a big fan of those type of predators. My friend Jan’s horrible speculation that they were into threesomes popped to mind and I became tense, uptight and distant. I wanted to scream: “Hey, why can’t you just spend an evening with me, alone, Dustin!” I don’t like love triangles.   Instead of screaming, I silently strained to hear the music over the lurching of my heart and was relieved when the boys left. I so don’t understand and I’m so looking at you right now like Janeane Garofalo in  Reality Bites . You see the look, doncha?

       My Ideal MASH Results   A couple days ago I thought: "Self, remember MASH? That game you'd play with your best girlfriends when you should've been paying attention in physical science or were playing a slightly naughtier version during slumber parties where you'd actually number your offspring, which would indicate that one day you would actually 'do it'?"   Self replied: "Oh, yeah. I remember that game. I loved that game until they got to the boys I wanted to the kiss-marry-have-relations-with part and then I would freeze and come up with famous men I would be willing to kiss, marry or have relations with, not necessarily in that order or as a series of steps toward a satisfying relationship, so I wouldn't have to name the REAL boys I liked. Plus, my best friend Carrie, at the time, had this pole in the basement and I think we would pretend we were strippers."  "Whoa," I replied. "I forgot about that one. How many other 12-year-olds do you know who practiced pole dancing (with their PJs on, mind you) at their slumber parties?"  "Not too many," Self said. "Not too many."   And with that memory, I jotted down the to-do of writing down my ideal MASH results now that I'm 25 and have since forgotten about the game and pole dancing.   So, without further ado, I present my IDEAL MASH RESULTS, minus the weird stripping reference that I'm sure will undoubtedly make those very few of you who read this blog, who haven't already, question me and my sanity.    Living Accommodations:  A Victorian farm house (these exist right?) on the outskirts of Columbia, Mo. and summer log cabin in Chattanooga, Tenn.    Husband:  To be determined, but decidedly funny, burly, witty and sexy-sweet.   # of Children : Three or four, and they will  all  request I drop them off at school AT LEAST a block away because I will be "that kind of Mom." They will have names like Sedona, Annalee, John & Jude. Don't make fun of Jude's name. He will kick your ass and know why his mama loves Thomas Hardy.    Professions:  Novelist, professor, bakery owner & kick-ass wife & mother   Car : 1972 Volkswagen Superbeetle Convertible painted cherry red (metallic, not matte) and some family car that runs off alternative fuel, like Daryl Hannah's Grassolean-fueled El Camino.   # of Orgasms:  OK. This was the naughty part of our MASH. I didn't get what that meant until, well, way later. But just in case, I think I'll put the sign for infinity to play it safe.    Thank God I didn't end up in the shack with someone named Joe Bob, who would father kids with rat tails. This is the fun of pre-determined MASH.  Send me yours!

       Memorial Day Milestones   *A year ago, I was in a pretty bad car accident. I didn't repeat it this time. Woo-hoo, no air bags and broken Lauryn Hill and Nappy Roots CDs covered in the V-8 that didn't keep me too straight on Route 13.   *I ran 2 miles Friday AND Sunday. I didn't die. I will run two more tonight, even though I stayed up till 5 AM reading "Save Karyn." I read that damn book straight through.   *I kissed a boy and didn't become a spaz. It was one of the sweetest kisses ever. I'm confused by said boy, but Marisa, a rockin' writer in my writing group, said you don't have to understand people or moments to love them.   *Summer cleaning is full throttle. I'm a season behind, but I'm proud.

       Feeling weak, but staying strong   Lately, a lot of people I know have said I’m strong. I don’t know how to take this because really I’m not. Essentially, I am a good faker. I don’t fake it with love or rock ‘n roll or lust or my genuine distaste of potato salad or coleslaw, but I do fake a lot of other things, strength of spirit being one of them. Some people are pretty smart and catch on that I’m a faker, but I think they still love me for trying.   I don’t have big muscles or superhuman strength. I am bullish and dogged rarely, and timid usually. I live inside my head and think about all of the really cool ideas I have, if only…  And then, when if only… pops up, I Vulcan death grip my fear and I manage to act upon what I think. Those acted-upon ideas sometimes turn out alright or else I move to Southern states and work with children and try to remember what it is I’m doing with my life and why some days I feel so gosh-darn lonely and pathetic. I’m 25. I’m supposed to be more together than this, right?   I was at a party recently that consisted of playing games (which I’m not too good at) and one of the people, after explaining my random career trajectory, said he had a “real job.” I about died. I don’t have a real job. I didn’t own a bed for the past two years until May. I live out of boxes and finally, yesterday, I crafted a living room using on-sale yellow Nautica bed sheets and turquoise Oriental throw pillows. I’m working on cleaning my bathroom and getting all the old clutter out of my life, but still the high school debate trophies and Christmas cards from 1999 remain. It takes time for me to let go and unload and during these inactive moments, when I’m lying on the mattress, which is on the floor, I think, “Self, what on earth have you done with your life and why are you doing it?”  And I usually answer myself back.  “Because you are finding your way and some times, most times, the easy way is not your way.”   So, I sigh and laugh through my tears and wonder how it is people think I’m remotely strong. Could it be because I’m tall? Do they know most bigger, larger-than-life people are almost always inversely soft, inside and sometimes out? Do they know that I wonder why I seem to suck at love, even though I have so much to give? Do they understand that my bravado and storytelling come from a shy girl in over-sized red-plastic glasses that used to sit at the back of the classroom waiting to be discovered?   Do any of us know what we have to get through to be where we are right now, however imperfectly?   I don’t, but I’d like to know. I’d like to know there are more messy, sweet people out there trying to make sense or at least some beauty out of such a strange, yet wonderful, yet cruel, world.   Until enlightenment (which maybe is just the journey itself?), I’m on my own 12-step program to self-fulfillment and I will continue to fake it until I make it. Please don’t hold it against me.

       My Ambassador of Sushi Love   No. 5 on my list of 25 things to do in my 25th year: Eat sushi; drink sake. Mission accomplished last night at Jun's, an AWESOME and AUTHENTIC (or so I'm told, because I really have no measuring stick at this point) sushi place in an Overland Park, Ks. strip mall with my friend Marisa, of the writers' group fame, and her husband Todd, who I debated in high school. Both swear it's better than the joints they haunted in NYC together, and I believe them!   Marisa is beautiful and funny and talented. She's the kind of girl it would be fun to be jealous of, but you can't be. She looks like a brunette Reece Witherspoon and wears great shoes. She's a teacher, seeker, writer and documentary playwriter, and she was more than enthusiastic when I mentioned I wanted to try sushi last Sunday. So, Friday night, here I sit, cross-legged, warm sake on my tongue, with a whole lot of raw fish in front of me and clumsy chopsticks.   Bless her and the Unagi she so loves.   Sushi is delish! I'm particularly fond of the salmon, tuna and sweet shrimp. The halibut was tasty. Tuna gushy and flavorful and the California roll OK. Nothing to write home about, but good nonetheless.  I'm hooked. I want to go back. Now, let's see...   What else is on my list? Suggestions for 26? (It's coming soon in September!! Yippee!)

       Neighborhood Watch Meeting   Taking a page from  urlLink Rob's  book, I will only give you the teaser and then you'll have to read the rest wherever I get it published.   I attended a meeting for my apartment complex last night at 8 PM. This is what I learned:  *Never attend something just for the cookies and Diet Coke. It will not be worth it.   *Don't wear a semi-suggestive top to said meeting. The men residents of your complex will ogle you needlessly. I think some of them have mental deficiencies. It's like the bill board I see en route to my dad's farm warning about the dangers of brain damage. For the record, I have never doubted the existence of brain damage.  *Don't ask the above men to quit calling you a looney bin or supporter of Big Brother merely because you're trying to hear what the police officer is saying about keeping your neighborhood safe.   *Scary man will follow you home from the meeting, careful to walk parallel to you across the street, screaming: "YOU WANT A PIECE OF THIS?" Um, no. I do not.  *You will then interrupt the meeting you just left early because a woman is now following PIECE-OF-ME MAN and screaming at him: "I HAVE A PIECE FOR YOU. INSERT EXPLETIVE. BLANKETY, BLANKETY, BLANK. SOME INCESSANT BEEPING. BLANK."   *The police officer will use you as an example of how communities have to patrol their own communities when you insist you don't want to press charges, you simply yelled HELP! because you were afraid the man and woman walking parallel to you were going to get into it.   *The police officer will look at your cleavage. You will remember to buy more undershirts. You will try to insist that you can walk across the street alone to go home, but the officer will insist on walking you so he may tell you he pulled a dead body *ONCE* from your apartment complex.  *You will have nightmares about this Neighborhood Watch Meeting and remember that silence is sometimes golden. You, my friend, are pyrite - fool's gold. And you just don't know how and when to keep your mouth shut.

       Embracing My Inner Amelie   Like all semi-hip, quirky folks, I loved the movie  Amelie . I loved her hair, her French ways, and the trap she fell into: wanting to save the world without saving herself. For some odd reason, I identify with Amelie as a do-gooder gone bad who learns how to take care of herself. That, though, is another subject.   Last night, after leaving work, I saw an opportunity to embrace my inner Amelie. I won't write about it, because, in my mind, that defeats the spirit of generosity. But let's just say I felt five times better about myself, about my silly little problems, and when I got home to my apartment after the unexpected good deed, I decided to reward myself by going to see Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11." Big mistake.   Not a big mistake about seeing the movie, but seeing it alone and in a strange Kansas suburb. I stood next to the hottest young man in Shawnee, Ks. He wore a Curious George t-shirt and knew what time it was. We had about 20 minutes to talk before we saw the movie. I assured him I wasn't hitting on him (and I wasn't) and proceeded to ask questions of this KU co-ed bored with school who has decided to enlist in the US Army. He came to view this film so he could hear from another side.   That's brave, I said, and I meant it.   What followed in that dark theatre is labeled propaganda by some, strong antidote by others. Please decide for yourself. My aim in life is not prosyletize. What moved me most in this film were the images of war. The bones through muscles and tissues of arms and legs. Dead babies. Injured and screaming soldiers. The anguished faces of mothers. The gentrification of America's poor neighborhoods. But, mostly the blood and the dead and the bodies.   My granddad fought in WWII as an enlisted Navy man. He is a decorated and wounded veteran. His right hand was crushed as a gunner's mate. Once he told me the story of his hand when I didn't understand why he couldn't give me high fives or catch a softball. He started his life post-WWII learning how to use his left hand. Maybe his hands are a metaphor for my political leanings.   All I know, is that I learned about war from my granddad. He has told me about the bodies he saw stacked like wood on the beaches of Normandy. He doesn't tell these stories often, but when he does, I see a saline fissure in an iron man and I remember what he says. I remember his war stories. They are not glorious anthem-busting tales. They are not meant for the feint of heart.   So, last night, I wept. Not because I believe everything in the film, but because there are people I have known stationed in Iraq. There are people I don't know who live there. These people's arms and legs and bodies are being stacked in carts or zippered up in bags and flown home. In my truck, on the way home to Independence, I screamed. I screamed into the night, outside the window, and past the red streaks of light on the interstate.   Today, I want to act. I support our soldiers, the men and women who fight for my freedom, but, honestly, I don't understand why we have sent them. I am writing my representatives, my congressmen and women, my senators, and the President. I am researching who I vote for this election. I will disband this apathy I have felt for quite some time and make informed choices and decisions.   Mostly, I want to embrace my inner Amelie. I want to serve myself and others. I don't want to get caught up in what I can't do. I want to focus on what I can.

       File This Under: "You've Got to be Kidding Me."   1.  What self-respecting Republican listens to The Ramones?  Apparently the ones across the hall. Then there would be me, the woman yelling at the passenger-less red Jeep Cherokee in the parking lot: "What the f@&*? You've got to be kidding me? Do The Ramones know you like GW and listen to old-school punk? It's a free and crazy country." They've also put all this patriotic red-white-and-blueness all over the building, banners and flags and crap. I'm a big fan of this country, but I believe in consensus building and not just package-taping flags on a communal building 'cause you're working for the man who thinks God has chosen him (Does anyone else remember learning about divine right and The Sun King in sixth grade? Is anyone else scared?).   I believe in healthy dissent and discussion and debate in all things political and, therefore, societal. I believe I once owned a pair of Stars and Stripes Converse I purchased in San Fran, but these decorations weren't a democratic decision for our office building. The elephants just took over, like some over-zealous homecoming committee. I think I'm going to spike the punch.   2. During a training session for my company, LIVE! via internet by way of Nashville, Tenn., our trainer has a pop-up arrive announcing the following:  "GET LAID TONIGHT!"  Geeze, almighty. That got my attention. What does she do with her office internet?   3. I changed my answering machine to something drab and boring: "Leave your name at the beep." I need help coming up with my weekly answering machine message.  No one left a message when I asked which song would you dance to if you were an exotic dancer?  I would dance to Hall & Oates' "Out of Touch" or AC/DC's "Back in Black." Doesn't anyone else embrace their inner stripper?  4.  I'm a little bit bummed because last night someone I love (and am related to) told me I find fault in everyone.  Afterwards, I finished  Lucky , an excellent, but not the most upbeat, memoir by Alice Sebold, ate black olives, drank OJ from a blue tin cup, journaled, called my best friend Jenna at 11:30 p.m. (sorry!), cried, read the freakin' Bible (I'm not a Bible reader, folks, but I'm having issues with forgiveness.) and then went to sleep, cranky and alone. I hate being bitchy. I don't think I find fault in everyone. Criticism, folks, is usually a round-house kick turned back on myself.

       Learning How to Spell Hallelujah    What I've Learned in Our Absence:  1. Office internet usage is limited to office work. 2. I've missed you.  3. Jeff Buckley, I love you. You sing beautiful songs. You make me wish there was someone here to kiss me. Damn you, Jeff Buckley.  4. Libraries are my churches.  5. The Management of my office building spells feminine products as "famine products," and then wonders why their toilets runneth over.  6. I have 8 days of work left.  7. Red lipstick will always be fashionable on these lips.  8. To-do lists are something I should've been compiling a long time ago. I don't always get things done, but I get a lot more done than I would've without them.  9. Jan Straka, I didn't appreciate you in high school the way I should've as a friend. Thank you for being my friend now.  10. Andra Eaks, I miss you horribly. I wish you would write or call me before I head out West.  11. Dave Alexander, I loved your letter. I wish more boys would write me. Really, let's not discriminate: I wish more people would write me. Girls, I love you too! 12. You should call me because my answering machine now unveils a weekly question and I award a prize to the best answer every week. The criteria of "best" changes with the message. If you question my fairness, you won't win this week.  13. I like Jet, the band. I know I'm corny and cheesy and have bad taste in music, but, damnit, you can dance to it. That's got to count for something.  14. For Father's Day, I mowed my dad's lawn in my orange Anne Klein tankini. (I got it for $25! Tell me you're not envious!) It is, for the record, the COOLEST swimsuit I've ever owned, barring the pink and white bikini I wore when I was 5. There are goldfish on this new suit. I'm considering a bikini wax; that's how commited I am to this suit.  15. My fellow writers, Marisa & Sarah, you crack my crap up. I love meeting with you, giving you gum from the reject men I've dated and reading your work and feedback.  16. Family Dollar has some cool-ass $3 sunglasses.

       One Big Broken Thing   Yesterday I rediscovered Elliott Smith's song, "Between the Bars." It reminded me of my time in Henderson, North Carolina. Reminded me of the times I've lived in "one of these days" instead of the present. I love this song and I knew Elliott had sung/wrote it, but didn't know the name because my friend Aaron put it on a mix tape for all of us novice teachers figuring out how to Drink Up.   For me, the song symbolizes the pie-in-the-sky dreams I often talk about, yet sometimes fail to follow through on. There's the 'zine and the cupcake bakery. There's the broken rocking chair I dragged down a stretch of Atlanta interstate sitting in the corner of my bedroom unmended. There's the blue stand-up gumball machine with no glass globe. I broke it sometime during college. There are the expired license plates and broken car stereo.  I wrote in a letter to a friend who probably hasn't received it yet that somedays I feel like one big broken thing. I know this isn't true, but when I see the things and dreams I own, I sometimes shake my head and wonder what I am doing.   I do believe I'll finish what I've started. I do believe I hit a snag in my life where I had to nurture my biggest thing, myself, before I could tackle the other things that inhabit my life.  And so I sing along to this lost and now found song: "do what i say and i'll make you okay and drive them away the images stuck in your head people you've been before that you don't want around anymore that push and shove and won't bend to your will i'll keep them still."

       I paid $30 to bleed.   (This post is not for the squeamish.)   So, I am a slave to culture and fashion and its fixation on hairless women. I paid for a damn bikini wax at Beauty Brands today. I told them it was my first time.   Kelly was not that gentle. She told me to stuff a paper towel in my underwear and then wrap it around the outside of the elastic band. Wax itself does not hurt. It's rather warm and pleasant. Cloth, oh cotton cloth, when you pair up with wax you become evil. There was a lot of ripping and me biting down on my bottom lip. Kelly said it's normal to bleed. There are so many virginal references in this visit that I can't help pointing this out.   I know this is TMI, but I want to know: Why do we do this?

       ‘Twas the day before my last hours at work,  not a bit of remorse tinged my day planner, The resignation letter tenured two months before  In the hopes to never see this damn desk any more.    My co-workers busy, pretending to work, As paychecks and rat-race illusions danced in their heads. The boss in another meeting, and I at lunch, Secretly coveting leaving this bunch.   Now, MONDAY! now, TUESDAY! now, WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY! On, FRIDAY! on SATURDAY! on SUNDAY & MIDWESTERN VIXENS! To the top of my to-do list go the things I desire!  To the top of it all, my own sweet resistence to alarm clocks, coffee-induced false starts  and bland, now-abandoned 9-to-5 existence.

       Why I Don't Need to Drink   Dear Last Night, (stealing a page from the lovely  urlLink Kristin's  book)  I was so bored and frustrated with you that I spent forever messing with a printer and $40 worth of ink cartridges without being able to coax a printed page from that crap-ass Canon bubble jet I purchased in North Carolina that I ate too many M&Ms and instantly felt guilty. I hate that I sound like Bridget Jones, but I'll get over that comparison and forge ahead.   So, I was staring at you, looking at the clock and my computer, with the stories whose words I couldn't tear up with my blue Precise ink pens and then rearrange and revise until exhaustion or narcolepsy took over. I called Jan back to tell her how much you sucked; she said come on over, she could fix that. I asked her if I should bring her the fixings for Shirley Temples, we bad girls we, and she said, pshaw, I already have the grenadine and 7Up and cherries, get your tookus over here.   With that, dear night, you became infinitely more laid back and more party. Less frustrated rut, more let's read Tarot cards and drink too many margaritas and order pizza with Canadian bacon and tomatoes. You exposed me to "Reno 911." I laughed so hard I fell backwards, stared at the ceiling and continued to crack up. Sometimes, on nights like these, I miss cable TV.   All I remember, after Reno 911 is that I asked Jan if I could spend the night. She said yes and gave me a pillow and a blanket and didn't tell me there was pizza on my hot pink t-shirt. She gave me a contact lense carrier and saline solution and laughed at her inebriated friend who is supposedly going to teach at an all-women's college and LOVE it. That Devil card kept coming up in my readings. Jan said it meant sex, I'm not so sure.   Plus, Jan's been dabbling in the occult since, well, forever. But she's a harmless good-girl Catholic. You can't put too much stock in those kind of things, right?   I woke up this morning, wishing I hadn't been so gluttonous. That temperance card should've come up more often. But Last Night, you weren't so bad. I had fun, laughing, dreaming and watching  Zoolander  and "eugoogle-lizing" my life with Tarot Cards and tequila's-already-in-it! margaritas. Thank you, now try to tell Today that she needs to help me fix that stupid printer.  Much love,  Kella

       It's earlier than I thought it was.    I woke up thinking it was already past 9 a.m. I was crazy enough to consider going to the EPA's presentation on the dangers of mercury in fish, mostly because there was $40 involved. But I didn't RSVP. I have real work to do, even if it's not paying me quite yet.   Today is a full-fledged writing day. No excuses, no more whining and turning to caffeine for inspiration. Writing, Kella. Remember? That thing you do regardless of whether you "feel like it" or "want to." Desire is so overrated. Discipline much needed.   I arrive at the library today before it's open. I have never done this, largely because I've been tied to a desk or asleep. Usually the latter. It's amazing how many people wait outside the doors of the Kansas City Public Library to play computer solitaire. Whatever happened to reading the good books?   I sound like a biblophile snob when I say this, but...  Now, I must put down my fair blog and turn to the stories I've started and now need to finish, as best as I can finish stories that sometimes don't have endings. Good morning all!

       A Note on Crush #346   Anyone who knows me, knows I have crushes on men, oh, once a day. It could be someone famous, but most likely not. Today's crush is brought to you by the Tarheel State, where I left middle school education and tobacco crops behind. There was this boy, OK guy, who I taught with, well, not in the same school, but the same county. He was kind of pompous and manly and sometimes said off-color stuff, but I really think his heart was always in the right place. He was also from the Midwest, which was really comforting to this girl who hadn't ventured more east than Tennessee.   Once, in a very  90210  reunion moment, at a wedding in Lawrence, Ks. last summer he asked to kiss me and I said OK. I didn't like him then. I was kind of shocked he wanted to kiss me. He usually made fun of me, probably because of that time I drove my truck into a ditch and someone volunteered our Mystery Man to ride home with me once Triple A towed me out. I was still crying when I got behind the wheel, embarassed and disoriented; he told me I was being emotional. I told him to shut the you-know-what up. I was emotional, and probably a little wrong in retrospect. So, I wasn't expecting a kiss from this man.   This is strictly research I told myself. Then he said I tasted like lemons. That so pissed me off. I am not sour. But maybe he meant citrusy and clean? But, dear readers, I assumed the worst, and that awkward kiss was that. I drove him to the airport and then let lips and lemons go.   And today I got an e-mail from this sucker. It was only four lines, but it made my heart soar.   My heart is a little slow. It shouldn't be soaring. He still lives in North Carolina and is going to be a doctor once he gets out of med school and is a devout Catholic. It probably wouldn't work because I'm a writerly flake who struggles with finding the right words for her pedestrian prayers and is moving to the desert at the end of July.   But this afternoon it was fun to think about getting a second chance to convince him that I most certainly do not taste like lemons.

       If I were Wild Bill Hickok I would be royally pissed off that the good people of Independence, Mo. are appropriating my name for a parking lot...   Speaking of wild, this being-off-work thing gives me a whole new perspective on life. A smart friend on a different path told me this weekend that our jobs, well his job, cannot be the sole source of meaning in our lives. Duh, most of you might think, but WHOA! for me. That so struck a chord. Maybe an E chord, because that sucker was always so hard for me when I flirted with being the next kick-ass girl guitarist. (That will still happen. I might be 80, but I will ROCK!)  Meanwhile, I've been living a life of a rock-and-roller with my sleep schedule. Last night I was up until 3 a.m. making mix tapes from my oh-so-large CD collection for my sister Jenna and my Writers Group members. (If you know of any good songs with writing process or revision references, PLEASE post a comment!) If you have a problem with AC/DC, Lauryn Hill, Lionel Richie and Gillian Welch sharing a tape, you need to open your mind or shut your ears.   And that, my friends, has been what I've been up to: Opening my mind to new possibilities. I'm keeping all the Kella that kicks ass and reinventing or reforming the not-so-kick-ass parts. Taking risks and trying stuff that might make me look even more foolish, but results in infinitely more living is my mantra. I need to shorten this, but until then...  I will write until the wee hours, eat Rainier cherries with gusto, run 2 miles in the humid hum of Missouri evenings, bake pumpkin muffins, swim with my sister Jenna and nephew Trent, sell all my worldly goods to lessen my load out west, risk rejection in publishing and love, and keep on keeping on.   I'm not that broken.

       You know it's bad when a  urlLink radio station  rejects you for it's Chubby Dating Game.   &nbsp;  I did it. This morning at work, I picked up the phone, dialed and took a chance on romance. (Well, not really, but&nbsp;there was free dinner involved&nbsp;and the guy was kind of funny in his bio and&nbsp;cute, if not skinny, and the radio station makes me laugh in the morning). I spoke with a male DJ&nbsp;who said I sounded sexy. I demured. Then he put me on the air. My words on why I should be The Chubby Chick Chosen: "A final fling before I leave Kansas City for grad school in Tucson."  &nbsp;  The DJs' response: Laughter and radio mirth. I'm so picked, I thought as I hung up. I'm so Mae West meets Janeane Garafolo. I'm so embracing my Buddha belly and ample thighs. I am soft woman, hear me, chomp?  &nbsp;  The result: The DJs never called me back to confirm whether I would be on the Chubby Chaser Dating Game. I think I was too tall (5'11") for them with not enough chub (I'm not even putting my weight here, but I assure you it is well over what it needs to be). The Woman DJ said I was a twig. Um, no. Amazon goddess, maybe. Twig, not unless I'm a&nbsp;Sequoia. I also ponder my useage of the phrase "Okie-Dok" on an alternative station. Maybe Okie-Dok equals Uncool. Equals undateable?  &nbsp;  I e-mailed the morning show to express my disappointment, but to congratulate my winning sisters in flab. The Realization: Is this a blessing in disguise? Or&nbsp;am I doomed to look for love/lust in all the wrong places?  &nbsp;  The Reflection:  Probably both are true.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       To All The Ones I've Loved Before   (and still do)   Was it Julio or Willie who penned this song? In any case, I'm suffering from the debilitating pre-move jitters. All of a sudden my euphoria leads to paranoia and pangs of homesickness. I haven't even left yet. I know this will pass. It always does, but usually in a fit of tears and subsequent hiccups and laughter.  This Monday and Tuesday I spent time with my best buddy Jenna. Usually time with her makes me wish I could make living next door to her my life long pursuit. We slept in, ate pancakes with strawberries, shopped at Goodwill and Blackberry Exchange in Columbia, Mo., met up with her boyfriend Ed at the pool, wore wonderful swim suits, ate deep-fried country fixins at Huerr's (a must for any fan of the chicken fried steak; however Jenna was good and ate a grilled chicken sandwich.), went to The Pinnacles ("Columbia's mini Utah," says Jenna.), watched  Sex and the City , Episode 6, fell asleep in Jenna's bed and wished that I didn't have to go home Tuesday morning. It was bliss and all friendships, all relationships I hope can be as good as this, or at least have a couple moments like them.   Lord knows there are a couple in my life that I'm not too good at fostering, but I am trying. (As wimpy and excuse-driven as that may sound.) I miss a lot of you already. I hope, in my absence, I become an even better friend, daughter, sister, whatever.

       I count my remaining days in the Midwest by the rolls of toilet paper I think I'll use before my move.    Tonight, I go grocery shopping for artichoke/provolone/chicken calzones so I can cook and listen to "This American Life" and then rejoin The Working tomorrow morning as my old office needs/wants my help and I need/want more money. It's a win-win situation, with none of the attachment or resentment in the end.   These past few days have been wonderful. I've got to see friends, picnic in places I never would've, drink decadant drinks in a red room, awake on a velvet green couch in my old college town, dine at a place with deer heads on the walls and hug people I won't get to hug for awhile.   I even took off all the old bumper stickers on my truck when I got back. Whoever tells you those things are tacky or will decrease the value of your car just don't know. All my labels past peeled off quite easily. I think, I know for me anyways, change is feared. But not tonight or tomorrow. Tabla rasa, baby. Tabla rasa.

       It's My Party, And It Will Rain If It Wants To   The first event I've hosted in quite some time has been officially rained out. I have dozens of cookies, some pretty tasty fruit (white nectarines, red grapes, strawberries) and a butt load of kickass "A Sweet Farewell" mix tapes to unload. However, Mother Nature doesn't give a crap. She's jonesing for a drink, and well, there's not much I can do about that except maybe pack.   With that said, I did what Bright Eyes recommends in the song "A Bowl of Oranges" and wrote a poem on my living room carpet. I managed to drag jeans on at noon after mixing my tapes from midnight and then back again at 7 a.m. Somehow, though, this cancellation is par for the course. I have a Plan B. It involves a coffee house. Maybe people will show.   But mostly, I hope everyone who knows me, knows how much they mean to me, with or without the mix tapes and the munchies.

       TAs of Old    August 11, 2004 is my first day of graduate assistant teaching training at the U of A. At Mizzou, we called 'em TAs. At the U of A, GATs. I prefer TA. Blame the Midwesterner in me, I suppose.   And, as I think about this, I wonder what quirks my students will remember if I'm half as good as some of my old TAs. There was Candy Apple for my Math-Class-For-Idiots course (pre-algebra). Venelin P. for J-200. Stan for J-105. There were so many that recently, oh last month or so when I went to see my little brother Reese play ball in Columbia, Mo., I didn't understand why the man I was talking to was so put off with my alma mater's use of TAs.   "My daughter said they didn't speak English much, so she transferred to Springfield." Leave it to a mid-Missourian for that response.   Personally, I loved my TAs. Here are a few of mine. (Tell me yours!)   1.  English Comp : He wore shorts in the dead of winter. We read John le Carre. He tried to get me into Honors, but I refused, after reading my journals. I wanted to find out why he insisted on shorts in January.  2.  World Lit : She had impeccable style. It's probably a poet prerequisite. Novelists seem messier. She said Wednesday as if it were a haiku instead of a word, all elongated and perfectly enunciated. We read Chinua Achebe and began thinking more carefully around someone so poised.  3.  Geography : He had shoulder-length brown hair and John Lennon glasses. He told me I made the best maps in the class and then I was uprooted by another who dabbled in computer graphics instead of colored pencils. But I didn't care; I paid more attention to his lips than my maps of South America. Rivers and mountains probably get tired of&nbsp;being static.  4.  History of American Journalism :&nbsp;He was Detroit meets punk rock meets John Travolta. "Watch the hair!" He wore a black ponytail and grunted at our assembly of know-it-all j-schoolers.&nbsp;My thoughts and papers were never provocative enough for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

       A Navel-Gazing Timeline   &nbsp;   8:30 a.m.:  Dappled sun comes in the window. Shower. Brush teeth. Dress. Make blueberry pancakes, drink herbal tea. Read J.D. Salinger on my stomach on the floor while listening to Muddy Waters.  &nbsp;   9:30 a.m.:  Walk to post office. Buy WWII memorial stamps in opposition to Disney ones. Talk to fellow line waiters. Send card to Jenna. Walk back to apartment.  &nbsp;   10:30 a.m.:  Go to library. Chat with the librarians I love. Check e-mail. Buy Layne's plane ticket from Tucson to Kansas City for her birthday. Mentally prepare myself for choosing a 12-year-old sister for&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;roadtrip. Decide she should wear headphones if tensions become tense. Get directions to the Nelson-Atkins' Sculpture Garden. Manage not to&nbsp;check out any more books. Say goodbye to fair librarians.  &nbsp;   12:30 a.m.:  Lunch consists of PBJ, lemon yogurt, abandoned orange (too watery) and green beans. Dad tells me&nbsp;I'm a fool for taking my truck to a dealer to have it checked prior to a 1,300 mile journey. Explain to&nbsp;Dad that, however foolish I may be, I am 25. I can choose foolishness and there's not much he can do about it.&nbsp;Resolve to&nbsp;get a second opinion on&nbsp;water pump issue, but to fix it independent of father just to spare myself the argument. Grab sketch notebook, list of books I'll need to buy before school starts and start the truck. Drive down I-70 West, to I-35 South, to SW Trafficway to Roanoke to Oak. Park truck.  &nbsp;   1:30 a.m.:  Wander around Sculpture Garden. Determine next Saturday's farewell party nook: For those in attendance, we will meet between&nbsp;Henry Moore's "Three Way Piece No. 1 Prints" and "Upright Motive #9." Walked along tree-lined path. Observed shirtless frisbee players and park-bench reader. Ran into visiting Italian family. Took their picture twice. Continued walk. Discovered bridal party stepping over stone wall onto grass. Noted that natural light and joy are great beautifiers. Wished I had bubbles or rice or a gift to bestow. Walked back to truck feeling like I had just witnessed a great example of the sacred and secular mixing it up on a Saturday afternoon.  &nbsp;   2:30 a.m.:  Write in the parking lot off Westport Rd. by 1/2 Price Books. Do this on the bed of red truck. One older gentleman asks if I do this often. I answer, only when the mood strikes. Suffer long drive-by by a man who's head is out the window while he drives. Look up and then wonder why I elicit this response from mostly creepy guys. Look down and continue to write. Go into 1/2 Price Books. Find only one book on my list for next semester, but the guy who helps me find it is a fellow writer and sweet and slight. He and his girlfriend are going to be professor/writers too. Thank impish hipster. He asks why I picked the University of Arizona. "I didn't have to take the GRE," I answer. He smiles. I leave.  &nbsp;   4:00 a.m.:  Back to apartment. A fog of reading Carson McCullers' "The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter" and James McBride's "The Color of Water,"&nbsp;a snack, a 2-mile walk and talking to my friend Jan.  &nbsp;   6:00 p.m.:  Dinner is uninspired but satisfying: Yet again, PBJ, milk and something else. I don't remember what. Take nap or shower after sweaty walk.  &nbsp;   8:30 p.m.:  Get ready for movie,  Napoleon Dynamite . Drive to Tivioli, off Pennsylvania. Buy ticket for 9:30 p.m. show at 9:28. Sit down, lights dim, movie up. Identify with Napoleon. Laugh. Leave an hour or more thereafter. Drive to sister's bar in Blue Springs. Order Diet Coke and kiss her, the every-busy waitress. Everyone here seems to vaguely resemble people I went to high school with. I decide to leave. Tip sister with a couple of dollars, Elliott Smith lyrics and a note. Drive home.  &nbsp;   4:00 a.m.:  I arrive home after midnight; I cannot sleep. Write two letters to Granddad and then friend. Read almost all of McBride's book. Then finally drag self to bed. Wake up before noon, dappled sunlight again.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Tomorrow:  Destination Tuscon    Yesterday, I had a migraine. I don't usually get them.   I don't remember the first time these started, but I think they began sometime in college. I distinctly remember getting glammed up/out for a staff shot when I became a CA at&nbsp;Jones Hall. We were Charlie's Angels. I was new to the staff. I didn't wear a lot of make up or shop at Express. I was afraid of all these beautiful, confident (seemingly so) women and I didn't feel very "angelish." My head was pounding. The next thing I knew, after the shot, I was walking outside in my ivory silk shirt and black pants and smelled eggs. I threw up and instantly felt better. This is the first instance of migraine I remember. I wish I could say it was the last.   The last time I had a migraine (before yesterday)&nbsp;I had to leave my first design class at The Art Institute of Atlanta. I ended up puking in the parking lot.&nbsp;This was the fall of 2002.&nbsp;I think stress has something to do with&nbsp;this.   Anywho, I tell you all this because I found myself at home last night, after an awesome dinner/chat with my friend Vicky, curled up in the dark, willing this excruciating pain behind my eyes to throb a little less, to relax a little more. I cancelled plans with my friend Carolyn. I called Jan back and ended up crying. At 9:30 p.m. my world felt bleak. I did what I should do more often when things like this happen: I went to bed.   I woke up today at 4:45 a.m. (Without an alarm clock.) My head felt warm and wonderful. The pain was gone. I didn't have to cover my eyes or weep. Moving to a new city/state didn't seem so daunting. I made a to-do list, went to Wal-mart and decided to go for one more walk on my favorite trail.   In the hour or so I walked, the hang-over of last night's migraine completely lifted. I saw a blue heron in flight once more. I walked to the iron bridge made in Alexandria, Minn. and stood in the middle of it and watched the water below to see if I could see the fish an old man I'd met before told me about. I said a selfish prayer: Please, God, even though I don't always do right by you, let me see a fish before I leave this place.   Either I'm a really good novice prayer or&nbsp;plain lucky, because not five seconds after, a fish surfaced under that bridge and I saw it.&nbsp;With that fish, my heart let go of all its trepidation and I walked back to my truck to face the day, close my checking account, pack my bags and take a deep breath. I can do this, even when my 2-year-old, soon to be 3-year-old, nephew asks me why. "Why are you leaving, Lala?" "Why are you going to school?" "Why?"   I can't answer all of his whys, but I know this is the right decision.

       Things I'll Miss About the Midwest  1) Friends who rally behind me (despite the rain) to meet up at an Italian restaurant and then go bowling after my party was rained out. I&nbsp;voted for skee ball, but Kristin and I got shot down.  2) My 16-year-old co-worker Becky. One day, she will rule the world and I hope I can be on her cabinet or committee or someplace where I can wield influence.  3) My dad's farm after&nbsp;unhooking two gates to get past the cows and the flies and the gravel ditch to drive away in the dark after a game of spades and, as my father calls it, a white-trash soul food dinner. I will miss walking with Layne after dinner and harassing Reese during it.  4) My mom and sister Jenna and nephew. They have the same big eyes with varying shades of color. The continuum goes like this: gray, gray-green and blue.  5) My friends Jenna I., Andra E. & Jan S. These ladies have helped me become even stronger, funkier, bolder and more beautiful. I live a richer life because of this triumverate. Long live&nbsp;these women!  6) The color green.  7) My granddad. I'm going to see him after this. I'm bringing him&nbsp;strawberries, nectarines, red grapes&nbsp;and white bread&nbsp;from the bakery I used to work at, along with the crap I won't be taking to Tucson. He is the storage facilty of so much for me: courage, hope, an old dresser and broken rocking chair. I used to bring him bread every other weekend after my grandma died. I've gotten lax. This trip will be the last time I visit her headstone for awhile. I always write her letters when I visit. Somehow, I feel like she's getting my little missives, albeit&nbsp;weathered and probably smudged. I somewhat ache&nbsp;about this fact. When I came back,&nbsp;she was here, and now, when&nbsp;I leave, she won't be watching&nbsp;The Weather Channel, fretting about torrential downpours, forest fires or traffic&nbsp;accidents. This kind of sucks.  8) The concept of chicken fried steak. I don't think Arizonans do this, do they?  9) My writers group. Marisa and Sarah, you two have helped me through so much. We must establish an e-mail contingent and write our little hearts out and pass it along. Stories save.  10) I'll miss not knowing what I'm going to be or do or feel or see. I have been so confused and muddy until now. I don't know what's come over me, but suddenly I know what's right (for me) and what I need to do to continue living a life full of truth, love and courage. Thank you to all of you who helped me along the way. My belief is strong. I will do, and am doing, what I've set out to do.

       Mt. Lemmon & Pie   If any of you come to visit me, I so know what we're doing. We're heading to the Catalinas and the Coronado National Forest for killer pie and killer views. We'll travel to 8,000 ft. and nurse basil lemonade outside among the conifers and the friendly mountain people. We'll watch the pocket gopher get fed Saltines from the kiddos. We'll tell Travis, the chef extraordinaire of the Mt. Lemmon Cafe, that he's a genius. We'll look at the white lights on a white tent and understand that white on white can be a good thing, especially at a cooler elevation. We'll watch the tourists and the townies and try to discern who is who. We'll wish for live music and then look at the wildflowers that grow on the moutainside. Afterwards, we'll go to Inspiration Rock or hike a portion of the Butterfly Trail. We'll look at the burn-out of a forest that's as alive as any of us, maybe more so. We'll feel our hearts in our throats and the sticky sweet perspiration that accompanies uphill climbs. We'll be sombered by the 25-mile-per-hour constant curves. We'll maybe personify the mountain as a woman and we'll give thanks for seeing a roadrunner in flight. We'll listen to Mozart, Marley and Matthews on the world rock station and then put concerto and nature in the same category of beauty.  Afterwards, on the drive down, you'll see an Arizona sunset and I'll be thankful you're in my passenger seat. The air will be hotter going down, but the memories will be sweeter upon decline.

      Destination Reached, Journey Begins  Greetings from Tucson! A place where you may bring your water bottles in movie theaters, where residents know their cardinal directions thanks to the amazing mountains located to the North, East & West, where produce is fresh and local, and where "swamp coolers" and "air conditioning" mean two very different things. I am here. I am well. I survived a hailstorm in Shamrock, Tx. My load, consequently, is a little lighter, a little wetter than I expected, but washing machines and clothing lines dry out what I salvaged and saved. Here, the laundry drys in 20 minutes on hot days. It's taking a bit longer in the two days I've been here, but I'm patient and ecstatic about inhaling sun-dried jeans and underwear and t-shirts.  * * *  I bought a bed today from Corrine at Sleep America. I hugged her before she made the sale. She hugged me back and, if she understood how long I've been without this padding, she'd probably have hugged me harder. I have a red bedspread and white sheets and sheer curtains where Saraswati, my Indian muse from my friend Aruna, looks over me and my endeavors in art, education and life.  My roommates are amazing and they humble me. They are smart, have amazing vocabularies and are helpful, cheerful and focused. They are Quaker. I feel like they will help me become an even better Kella. I'm excited.  Tomorrow, I buy a bike. I'll swim at the city pool with my little sister. I'll pick up my bed. I'll set it up. I'll lie down and look at my white walls and listen to Howlin' Wolf and the barking dogs next door. Then, I'll take a deep breath and take a nap. I think I've earned it. I miss you.
