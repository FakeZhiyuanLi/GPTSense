      hey all   well im shure if you read this you will know of adam by now. well people have said he is not a good guy to date beacuse of his past faults, well i know that is all true, and i know what he is like with his girlfriends, and i know he has a temper, etc but i dont know what it is that makes me still like him? i still get all bubbly in the stomach and giggly, but my head is saying you know what kind of guy he realy is. Its like a kid who had heard his parents say dont touch that it is hot you will hurt your self, but the kid still does it any way, thats the way i am feeling right now, i have my friends telling me no, but i am still reaching for it knowing they no best. I do like him soooo much though and if we do start something i want to have a talk with him before and lay down some rules, and if he doent like them then i know that it wont work beacause i wont be like his old girlfriends i wont let him do that to me. thanks for reading if you did.  later days! cayla

      hey all  its has been a while since i have written and i am sorry for all who read, but nothing at all has happened, i have barly left the house, and when i do its for the gym, or to go shopping whith lydia (my cousin). well i guess i can babble on about stuff. i havent seen or talked to adam in like a week, i was so mad when his ex answered his phone i havent talked to him since. He stoped by about a week ago(that was the last time i seen him)and he honked when me and lydia were leaving safeway.  my mom and claude whent to thunder bay to see his daughter and new born grandchild but when the got to the airport there seats were cancled, they never recived any noticed that it was cancled, so mom was crying the the airport claude was making a scene but mom wrote a letter to airmiles and claude talked to them on the phone about all of it, it was a very heated conversation.  I am still on the hunt for a job, still no luck with any of the reaumes i droped off earlyer. I have droped off a resume and everyplace i like. still no job, now i have no clue where to work now at all. it suck big time because that was the whole reason why i dident apply any where for school is so i can work, now i have no work and no school.  i promise britt and everyone else that i will keep up with my blog.  later days. love cayla  ps: i dont have a quote because they are down stairs.
