      I haven't had to work since Thursday.  Aside from Friday's foray into sunshiney unfamiliarity, the weather has been remarkably consistent with rain and clouds.  This morning, I'd finally had enough when I saw the sun overhead, and decided to trek out to Lake Calhoun for a couple laps of rollerblading.  Sadly, what I discovered when I arrived was that dark clouds were directly overhead and rain was imminent.  This didn't bother me so much for the rollerblading (I still made my laps around the lake), but rather, because I'd brought along some electronics - specifically, my iPod and my digital camera.  Taking photographs isn't something I do on anything resembling a consistent basis, but I enjoy the few times when I have the opportunity to snap a few shots.  Lately, however, the weather has been against me, today being a perfect example.  I left my electronics in the car, only to be lightly drizzled on for about 10 minutes.  Clearly, I had a hand in keeping the weather somewhat nice this morning, because if I'd brought my electronics along, it would've poured (which it did anyway, later in the day).  Tomorrow is my last day away from the office, and I'm hoping the weather cooperates and gives me one last chance to enjoy the outdoors before the weekend.

      And suddenly, it's come to this - a web log.  It is, in fact, a sort of precursor of things to come, as I've put off publishing content on my website for far too long, and I figure if I start posting my thoughts on a somewhat regular basis, I might be so inclined as to start including other facets to the site.  So, here we are, in cyberspace, as I prattle on endlessly about things you may or may not really be interested in reading.  Just remember, the bottom line is motivation, and until we can motivate ourselves to introduce change, real progress has not been made.

      In the coming days, I'm taking a risk on something I've never previously experienced:  I'm going to turn in my notice at my current job before having acquired myself a position elsewhere.  As I'm certain anyone who's ever been laid off can attest to, it's probably not the easiest thing in the world to acclimate yourself to.  And, considering how I have no real savings and expenses are looming, an assortment of unfavorable problems could arise.  The thing is, I'm not particularly concerned with things that haven't happened.  I'm more worried about the current state of my well-being and the fact that I've been truly  miserable  for the past year or so.  I can't go on like this, and like the clich√® goes, "you've gotta shit or get off the pot."  I've encountered less-favorable ups and downs in my life, and for one reason or another, leaving a job without knowing what the future will bring is more exciting to me than something I've previously experienced.  Because, as opposed to having the landscape decided for me, I get to choose my path and walk precisely and precariously, determining my own fate and fulfilling my own wishes and desires.  Will I earn as much money as I do now?  Probably not.  Maybe my benefits won't be as good.  But I will be happier, and isn't that really the point of living in the first place?

      Tomorrow evening I will be making the voyage from Minneapolis to Chicago by way of a rental Dodge Neon, courtesy of Enterprise.  For $14/day, it's really hard not to justify renting a vehicle, and I'm looking forward to my first Enterprise experience, as I've heard nothing but good things.  U.S. Maple is performing at the Empty Bottle on Saturday evening, which is my sole purpose for going.  I'm hoping they will play their cover of  Lay Lady Lay , but I'm not counting on it.  Either way, it will be exciting to see them play again, as I was really blown away when I last saw them in February.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for good weather.  The Milwaukee Brewers are hosting the Houston Astros at Miller Park, and it's the only non-interleague game happening on Sunday afternoon.  Instead of sticking around in Chicago to see the White Sox play the Braves (my two most-hated teams behind the Yankees), I'll get to see an improved Brewers club against a potent Astros lineup.  Maybe Clemens is pitching?  I'm not sure.  National League Baseball is much more interesting anyway.

      On Sunday, I'll be attending my third Minnesota Twins game of the season.  They're hosting the Boston Red Sox at the Metrodome, and it's going to be a hell of a pitcher's duel between Johan Santana and Pedro Martinez.  I purchased my tickets from a reverse-scalper - two tickets for the price of one.  Excellent.  Notes of interest:  My friend Nick has asked me to design the site for his band,  urlLink Sicbay .  I think it'll be a good opportunity to get back in the swing of doing some HTML design.  I'm hoping to learn some CSS in the immediate future to apply to this-here site as well.   urlLink STNNNG  finished recording 2 1/2 weeks ago in Chicago with Mike Lust.  We're going back in September to mix.  I'm working on talking to some friends about getting artwork created, and I think we're near consensus on an album title.  It will be revealed on the site shortly.  Also, I'm selling my digital camera, so if anyone is looking for a high-megapixel, low-maintenance camera, you can buy my Sony DSC-P92 for $250.  I want to upgrade to a Canon brand.  I will include a 128MB memory stick.  E-mail information is available somewhere in this blog, I think, otherwise you can write the STNNNG e-mail, available  urlLink here .  And with that, I leave you with pictures of prairie dogs.

      On this, the eve of my 4-night stay in Chicago, I've been contemplating my life, the many goals I've set for myself, my successes and failures, and all the little things I'd like to accomplish in the next 12 months.  Some of it is of rather preposterous emotional weight, but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good about the direction I'm headed and the uncertainties that lie before me.  It was during this process when I realized it's already been almost a month since I've added to my blog, and I began to question its importance.  Or, moreso, the role it currently plays in my life, and how I can take better advantage of it.  For now, I figured it to be in my best interest to use this outlet as a different way to express my general thoughts.  You see, I already have other places with which to reveal my more personal thoughts - places less readily accessible to the general public and those who might not necessarily be interested in what I have to say.  No, this blog...it shall serve another purpose, one which I'm not entirely sure of.  I think I'll give it some time to take shape.  With that, I'd like to share an entirely unrelated thought:  The new  urlLink Gorge Trio  album is a brilliant masterpiece.  I've been giving it occasional plays during my downtime at work, when I can focus more intently on the many intricacies of the song structures.  There's so much improvisational goodness packed into the album's 32 minutes, and with 22 songs, it almost flies at breakneck speeds.  Some of the songs play out like radio jingles for ADHD children, and other  sounds , particularly guitar tones, are very recognizable due to the shared membership of other bands, but I think it gives the record an almost immediate familiarity to people who might hearing the band for the first time.  I really don't know if there'll be a better record to be released this year, but certainly I'm a positive recipient of a very polarizing band.  For as much as I love them, I think there are definitely those who will try to stake claim that there isn't 5 seconds of music on the record.
