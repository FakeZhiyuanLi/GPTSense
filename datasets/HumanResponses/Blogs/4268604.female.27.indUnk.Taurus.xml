      For several weeks I have been able to watch the veins in my groin palpitate in unnatural and painful ways. Every time I climb the four flights of stairs to my apartment it takes an extra hour because the bowling ball that is crammed between my legs is getting heavier and heavier. But just in case I wasn’t getting the hint, my doctor kindly observed that, “Wow, there is a lot of pressure down here” during today’s exam.  In case I didn’t feel like I was getting my moneys worth with the first brilliant diagnosis he followed that keen observation with two very helpful suggestions: “You could go at anytime or you could walk around like this for two more weeks.” Gee, thanks.  Even when pressed for an estimate, the doctor really has no way to tell what “anytime” means. In fact going to the doctor to get checked for progress might be the most unscientific test of the entire pregnancy. There are no tools to measure how many centimeters I am dilated or how much I am effaced. The doctor simply feels around and suddenly declares that I am 80 percent effaced, meaning these “practice” contractions are actually doing some pretty heavy work and I should start freaking out because I could go into labor now….or in three weeks. Good to know.  Of course I don’t register the three weeks estimate for a few hours and I immediately go into the “I’m having a baby any minute mode.” What does that mode entail for a very pregnant woman? Well first she freaks out, because once again she is violently ripped away from the picture perfect life of calmly sitting in the nursery where she has folded and refolded onesies for a phantom baby while rocking in the rocking chair that might someday be used to the reality that there is going to be a whole new person living in the house in moments. Then she calls her husband to tell him the news so that he too can freak out. Because, really what else are partners for?  Next, I need not stop at Go to collect my two hundred dollars before forging ahead in full throttle. I forget that the nursery is meticulously organized and I fixate on the two things I don’t have: gigantic pads and Vaseline. Gigantic pads are self-explanatory. Obviously you cannot trust your husband to arrive home with the right kind of monster pads if he is sent out immediately after bringing the baby home. He will creep down the aisle on his tiptoes as if all of those feminine products might suddenly awake and attack only to pick up the first thing he can reach: tampons or panty liners. Triumphantly he will arrive home and proudly present his acquisition as you burst into tears.  Why the Vaseline? For weeks night time has no longer meant curling up in bed and falling asleep. Instead it is filled with countless trips to the bathroom and award winning pillow sculptures meant to support that single, one and only, comfortable sleeping position. Oh and yes, the rest of the time is occupied obsessing over everything from the birth to the unacceptable clothes our daughter will wear when she is a teenager and dating real live boys.  However, recently this productive mental exercise was filled with the complications of having a baby boy. In this scenario we had a beautiful baby boy, but when we brought him home I couldn’t change his diaper because we had no Vaseline to dress his circumcision wound. What a terrible mother! As if that were not cause enough to revoke my recently earned and oh so valued motherhood badge, I suddenly didn’t know which way to point his penis in his diaper! I didn’t want to point it down in case it became uncomfortable and I certainly couldn’t point it up because he would pee right out his diaper all over his umbilical cord and cause a life threatening infection. Though I don’t know how to actually situate his boy parts in the diaper yet, I do have the Vaseline and am once again calmly prepared to wait for this baby, even for a few weeks, while I watch Michael Phelps swim for the gold.

      For women who have complacently gone through the majority of their pregnancy obliviously focusing on baby names, duck-themed onesies, and nursery colors, the beginning of birthing class can transform them into wide-eyed deer in front of a Mack truck. Suddenly a formerly content pregnant woman who once sat calmly knitting her baby’s first hat is sent into a deep downward spiral of fear where creeping out of every repressed part of her brain are scandalous unfit mother thoughts like, “What were you thinking!” “Give this baby back!” and “There is no way you are going to make it through this!”  In fact the object of birthing class may not be to teach breathing methods or breastfeeding positions, but rather its goal is to abruptly shake us into the reality that all too soon this adorable little parasite is going to have to come out. Suddenly a tiny six pound baby seems to feel more like a fourteen pound Thanksgiving turkey and any sane pregnant woman knows that there is no way last year’s turkey is going to fit through that narrow and oh so delicate space.  The first day of birthing class starts out calmly as each couple introduces themselves and proudly proclaims their due date and practitioner of choice. There are silent glances of superiority from the women who have chosen midwives, birthing centers, and home-births over traditional doctors at traditional hospitals. The birthing coach seems to endorse these brave women while the rest of us feel weak and old fashioned for choosing a doctor. Throughout the class we spineless traditionalists become even more anxious that we will be the victims of an unnecessary C-section because instead of being able to labor in a hot-tub or draped over a birthing ball, we stupid women are stuck with a doctor who will strap us to our bed and hook us up to countless machines in the most uncomfortable and unproductive labor position.  Despite the subtle paranoia beginning to cloud my brain, the class seems to go smoothly as people ask mundane questions about diapers, breastfeeding, and epidurals. In fact I am not even disturbed as the instructor absent-mindedly plays with a stuffed pelvic bone in which an oddly shaped baby is being pushed out onto the floor over and over again. After the fourth dropped baby the instructor inquires, “Why does Mother Nature make birth so painful?”  The philosophical group of Brooklyn hipsters spout out elaborate answers that would impress Socrates himself. However none of these clever answers are the responses she was digging for. Finally a voice of reason from the back calls out, “because you are having a damn baby!” Though this seems obvious to everyone and we all wonder how its simplicity escaped us, the instructor begins to explain that Mother Nature made this process painful so that early woman would come in from the hunt and off of the field and bear down for this process. In other words it is a painful experience so that uneducated primitive women would not simply let out a little gas and drop their baby in the middle of the field. This response to her philosophical question is intended to both reassure us that birth is a natural process that millions of women before us have endured without the benefit of classes, coaches, drugs, and hospitals and to toughen us up. Because really what should we be scared of? Women have done this for thousands of years in much worse circumstances. In other words stop your whining wimpy twenty first century hipsters.  But we shouldn’t remain too calm or get too comfortable with the fact that we are going to be able withstand this age-old phenomenon because now the instructor drops the stuffed baby to pop in the first of many 1970’s era videos. At first it’s a friendly video full of animated sequences explaining where the baby is at each point during pregnancy and how the baby turns and manipulates itself into position. Then without any warning the video cuts to a live birth and zooms into a full view of a woman’s vagina where what looks to be a grimy, mildewed volleyball is emerging. The entire class gasps and looks away from the unnatural and stomach-turning scene. While my husband squeezes my hand and whispers in a shaky voice, “Wow, thanks for doing this,” the woman in the video looks down at her crotch and yells, “It doesn’t even look like a baby!” Thank You! That is what we were all thinking. This white cone-shaped thing certainly cannot be her beautiful baby!  We watch a few more minutes as she grunts and moans and the camera zooms in on her fourteen closest friends watching this humiliating act and then zooms into her entirely naked body until, finally the baby pops out and is placed bloody and screaming on the woman’s bare breast. At the conclusion of the video the instructor asks if there are any questions or concerns. Hell yeah there are!  Why is that baby white?! Why are there so many people watching her? And why oh why is she naked in front of her mother-in-law? But we are all too shocked to respond so the instructor breaks for snacks.

      Normally I would be planning my lessons and shopping for an unlimited supply of pens and paper for my unprepared seventh graders. But this August I am fighting back against feminism and counting down the two and a half weeks until I am a stay-at-home Mom.  The homeless man on the steps of the West Fourth platform told me that I am having a boy. He kindly wished my son and I lots of luck. The man on the ladder at Lowes hollered, "Its a boy" as he almost slammed his ladder into my wide load. My students declare that my baby will come out cursing because it spent its first six months listening to their seventh grade East New York mouths. But most people say that there is girl in there. Personally, I don't know if I am carrying high or low or if my belly looks more like a football or a basketball. But I do know that there is something growing in there. I see flailing limbs out the side of my belly on a daily basis and can spend endless minutes watching my belly heave up and down with baby hicups.  I am eight and half months into this pregnancy and I have 21 pounds to show for it. Recently I have found myself drooling over my Citizens jeans and tearing-up as I thumb through my Anthropologie catalogues. As if I wasn't already tired enough of my 20 extra pounds, yesterday The Gap sent me an email with the subject "Time For New Jeans." Gee, Thanks.  At the beginning I thought I would never tire of being pregnant. That is until I suddenly woke up and realized that somehow I really am going to have to get this baby out of this tiny orifice. Before that epiphany my biggest worry was who would be the next to make an amazingly insensitive comment about my new body shape. Once people discover that you are pregnant it seems as though they lose all filters. I heard everything from "Hollywood Mom" to "Wow, you are big for four months" to a male co-worker's observation that my "Rack is huge!" Its funny how the people with the most oddly shaped bodies have the loudest voices upon finding new pregnant prey.  Now that delivery is upon us, I worry about the fact that I have yet to buy overnight pads by the caseload and that I don't have the right shaped nipples for breastfeeding. I dream about little faceless babies cooing up at me and then suddenly growing into loud twelve year olds overnight. Then I feel the contractions. Are they Braxton-Hicks "practice" contractions? Or am I really Going to Have This Baby Today? Nope. Not today.
