      Hey ya'll. Just got back from a refreshing dip in Scott's hottub-who knew it could be so damn cold in Ohio in July? I don't remember this. Well, anyway, time to get going. Oh, and figure out what clothes I'm bringing. I tend to be a light packer, but I still have to make those difficult decisions. Jean skirt or black skirt? etc.  I'm really looking forward to going, but nervous, too. I don't speak Hungarian. I'm a picky eater-will I be stuck eating Borscht (which I very much dislike)? Do they even have Borscht there? We'll see. Stay tuned.

      Location: Prague, Czech Republic Accommodation: Clown &amp; Bard Hostel, only 5 dorm beds, but with 3 very messy German boys Number of McDonald's I've already seen: 3 Most exciting thing about Prague: The  urlLink cow parade  is here! Yay!  I arrived in Prague this afternoon after a lovely train ride in from Bratislava, Slovakia (my train even had air conditioning! a novelty). I met a French girl at the hostel last night who was going the same way, and it's always nice to have company as a lone traveler.  This is my last stop, and I intend to make the most of it, which is why I'm staying in a notorious party hostel with its own pub.  My last few days in Dubrovnik were nice, even if Lauren and Andrea did leave early therefore slightly messing up my plans. But nevermind, I met nice Aussies at Mama's (the private house I was staying in), and all was good.  Does anyone know anything about dermatology out there? If you do, please email me. Here's what I've got: Day 1: red blotches on my thighs, no big deal Day 3: they start to turn bright red and blister, with big puffy white centers, they kind of hurt Day 6: today, I have them on my back, stomach, other leg, and, other unfortunate places that makes it a bit uncomfortable to sit down.  What the hell do I have? I went to the pharmacy and she had no idea, but did give me some sort of cream. Who knows what it really is, since it's all written in Slovakian. I've done extensive searches on the internet, and the closest thing I found is a stinging seaweed that surfers seem to know about. What if I have some strange Croatian disease? They told me it was safe to drink the water, and I believed them!  Well, let's hope by the next entry it's cleared up because it's a bit uncomfortable and it looks a little scary. There's an American Medical clinic, I might end up there. But first I'll be taking an organized city tour tomorrow leaving from the hostel. I have priorities.

      Location: Still Dubrovnik Accommodation: A room with a really old Croatian lady-but there's no curfew! Still the most beautiful place I've ever been: Dubrovnik, Croatia  So Lauren and Andrea, my cousins, breezed into town yesterday. It's really fun to have a bit of family around after all of this travelling alone. I've met amazing people, don't get me wrong, but it's good to have laughs with people who know you well.  As soon as they arrived, Lauren was dying to jump into the sea, so, despite the sun almost being down, we went for a most excellent swim. Then we got dressed and went out for drinks and dinner, which was yummy. I've been eating a lot of excellent sea food here.  Lauren woke me up singing about sunshine before 9-she was that excited-so we quickly found a private room as we want to avoid curfew tonight.  Now we're on our way to the beach- we have a ferry to catch and then we'll be at a local 'clothing optional' beach. Don't worry, we brought plenty of suntan lotion!  Tomorrow there's talk of taking a ferry up north; from there they'll catch a ferry to Italy and I'll fly back to Bratislava, Slovakia before continuing on my way to Prague. Croatia's lovely but quite expensive, so I'm looking forward to getting back to the 'real' Eastern Europe where beer is cheaper than water.  Thanks for the emails!

      One of the best things about travelling is meeting other backpackers. I have met and befriended people from: Canada, many states, New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Ireland, Italy, Spain, France, and many more. There are always plenty of stories to be told and, of course, many pints of beer to bed had. The following story comes from poor Max, a teacher from San Francisco living and teaching in Cairo, Egypt. Max looks and acts a lot like a U.S. Marine, I might add.  So one day Max was in Budapest, and a bar owner invited him in for a drink. Having a few hours to kill before heading off on a train, Max accepted and had a beer at the bar. Soon the bill comes-$500 U.S. He say, 'This can't be right, I only had one beer!' The menacing barman instructs him to look at the menu where he sees that, indeed, a beer costs 500 dollars. Which, I might add, is the usual limit for a cash advance off of your credit card. Max refuses to pay, and is promptly escorted to the basement by burly Hungarian men who sit him down and show him pictures of badly beaten up guys who refused to pay. Giving in, said beefy guys accompany him to the ATM nearby and thank him for $500. Needless to say, Max didn't enjoy Budapest nearly as much as I did.  This scam was actually highlighted in my guide book, and his too, but unfortunately he hadn't gotten around to reading it. I just realized this might scare some of you, but I promise I'm being careful, not taking creepy invitations, and know that there are risks inherent to travelling around develeoping former Communist bloc nations.  The biggest threat here in Dubrovnik, however, seems to be the multitude of lascivious Italian men muttering, 'Como estai?' under their breath as my friend and  I walk by.  It was pouring this morning when I woke up-after an early night in, finally, thank goodness-and so windy. Do they have hurricanes in Croatia? It has cleared up by now though, so we have our bikinis in our bags, ready to sneak into a beach club. Keep the emails coming!

      Location: Dubrovnik, Croatia Dorm room: only four beds this time! Most beautiful place I've ever been: Dubrovnik  Well, it has been hard to get to a computer as of late, as I have been having way too much fun. Last time I wrote I was unsure of where to go next, but I think I chose correctly. On Tuesday some British friends I had made, Fred and Tom, and I went to Bratislava together, which was surprisingly very nice. They left that morning, but I made friends with a funny guy from Italy, Daniel, and we spent the day together touring Bratislava. Who knew Slovakia would be so lovely? I didn't. Cobblestone streets, magnificent cafes, castles... but less touristy and cleaner than other places.  How old is the oldest nightclub in Bratislava? 13 years. In an old Communist bomb shelter underground, of course. It was worth going to have a look. Those Slovakians-so creative.  Which brings me to Dubrovnik. It's more beautiful here than any place I've been, even Italy; and since this is where all of the Italians take their holiday, it almost feels like Italy. Last night after flying in I found my friend Rachel, whom I met in Budapest and have been emailing with, and we met up with some Aussies to hit the town.  First of all, we're in a hostel with a curfew, which means if you come home between 2 and 7 am you'd better be sober enough to shimmy the drainpipes and knock on the windows of rooms 11 and 12 and hope they unlock their windows for you. So I was a bit skeptical about missing curfew, but before I knew it it was 2 am anyway, so (poor me) I decided to make the most of it.  I wish there were USB ports here to show pictures, because I can't describe how gorgeous the town is. We spent the evening wondering cobblestone alleys, and ended up at a nightclub until I dragged Rachel off the dancefloor at 5:30.  This left us with a difficult decision to make-should we take a swim at sunrise or try and break into the hostel? We did what all sensible twenty somethings would do and made a beeline for the shore. When I say shore I mean scaling rock cliffs to get down to the very rocky sea. There are hardly any sandy beaches in Croatia, although I do hope to find one tomorrow. It was an amazing swim, and we finished and got to the hostel just as the prissy desk lady was unlocking the door. After sleeping until 2 pm, we're ready for more. Tonight we said we were going to take it easy as to be more productive tomorrow, but I say that everyday.  I just got an email from Lauren, who has decided to meet me here on Sunday, instead of Hvar, the island we had originally intended to meet on. I can't wait to see my cousins!

      Next up... Bratislava? So here I am, in lovely mediveal Cesky Krumlov, at a crossroads if you will. I know I need to get to Croatia, and I thought I was all set because I'd found a ticket for 40 dollars to fly there from Prague. Well... apparently I missed a zero in the currency converter, because it's actually 400. Which is a little hard to justify. So, I decided to go to the pubs with my "mates"-can you tell I've been hanging out with a lot of British & Irish people? I thought that would help me make up my decision. And it did, because we stayed out so late having so much fun (the Irish girls singing drinking songs, bars called the "snake pit" with one very green snake) that I missed the morning train to Prague and I'm headed to Bratislava with two "blokes" from my room. Whoops, our bus leaves in 20 minutes. Gotta run, more later, from the lovely city of Bratislava (Slovakia)!

      Location = Cesky Krumlov, Czech Republic Population = 14,000 people American equivalent = castle at Disneyland Ratio of tourists to locals = 100 to 1 Hostel environment = beer, table dancing, lovely showers, 8 beds to a room Location of the colon, question mark, and apostrophe on a Czech keyboard = no idea Lost item count = 1. I accidentally left my sneakers in Budapest. Oops.  Well, when my train from Vienna pulled into Cesky Krumlov at sunset last night-after 2 transfers in the middle of nowhere-I thought, what am I getting myself into.  I followed a crazy American guy into town, up roads, up cobblestone steps, through the iron town gate, around torch-lit corners, to my cavernous hostel flanked by, of course, pubs selling the ubiquitous Czech beer. I soon found my bed, some Irish girls to play cards with, some beer at the hostel, and fell right in step.  Next we went to a cocktail bar where I sipped some absinthe, but I did not, as Moriah has, fall in the streets in the fetal position from too much of the green stuff. Maybe tonight, after I go to the rotating Opera theater-there is not much to do here.  Today I spent the day climbing the castle tower-pictures will be up as soon as I get to a place that believes in computers created after 1994-and, of course, eating and drinking coffee and wine. My body could really use a break from the drinking, but honestly, that is pretty much what entertainment there seems to be here in Cesky Krumlov.  It is gorgeous here in a Medieval way, but I am a city girl at heart.  Tomorrow some other backpackers and myself have booked a canoe to travel down the Vlatva, and then Tuesday I will hopefully be flying to Dubrovnik. If I can get Croatian airlines to pick up the phone and take my order, that is.  Brush with authority... Last night a bunch of us were gathered in front of the hostel taking pictures when the Czech police raced up, telling us to shut up meanly, and then demanding passports of the poor souls who were talked into taking the pictures in the first place. My cowardly self raced inside, and it turns out the police took the peoples passports and then demanded money to get them back. Ah, the corruption. More soon.

      Here I am in Vienna, last day in this wonderful city. I wasn´t sure what I would think of Vienna, but I love it. I´d spend another day here if I hadn´t already changed my plans a gizillion times. First of all, the Europeans know how to live. I knew this, but everyday here reinforces this. Coffee, wine, beer, outdoor cafe, fast public transportation... LA could take a few hints from the Austrians.  The first day I was here I went on a walking tour of the city, which was a great and quick way to see a lot of the city. I met some great people on the tour, and we went out to lunch afterwards and consumed enough pork to feed a small African country. The Viennese do NOT take eating lightly. I love this place.  After that, I went alone to the museum quarter, which is wonderful. I was in museum heaven. I spent the day at the modern art museum, alternatively exploring the galleries and resting on benches trying to digest all of the sausage I´d eaten for lunch. After that, my new friends from New York, Elliot and Zach and I went to a great resaurant and enjoyed a long, nice meal Viennese style. After too much bread and cheese on the road I was very pleased.  Fast forward to night, when my friend and I were sitting outside of our hostel on some steps, taking a break from the loud, stifling hostel bar, where we did, I might add, kick some American and Australian ass in pool. Those of you that were with me in Chicago for my 5 consecutive dart losses will appreciate this. Anyhow, so we´re sitting there, and apparently we inadvertently had taken over someone else´s territory, because soon a young blonde woman comes charging up the stairs, blowing us kisses and asking very kindly if she and a much older, shady guy can be alone for 10 minutes on the stairs. Startled, we left. First of all, they should tell you in guidebooks that your hostel is in the middle of whore-central. Second of all, 10 minutes? Talk about a fast, efficient worker.  So yesterday, we decided to rent bikes and explore the Austrian vineyards. Needless to say, due to confusing bike routes and signs exclusively in, well, German (my knowledge being limited to ´one bratwurst with french fries and ketchup, please´and ´where is the subway, please´), we never found any wine, but we had a fabulous time nonetheless. There´s an island in the middle of the Danube here, where we cycled along the river and many Austrians sunning themselves, most completely naked. I probably saw more wrinkles than one should in a day, but it was a perfect day to be outside. Add ice cream to that, cold beer, and great company and you have another brilliant day on the backpacker European trail.  Coming up: train to Cesky Krumlov, Czech Republic tomorrow, then flying to Croatia.

      Location: Vienna, Austria Hostel: Wombats City Hostel Number of drunk Australians: Countless  It's nice to be back in a country where I feel confident asking for a bratwurst or the u-bahn in my crappy German. Hungarian (Magyar) was very hard.  After a day of happily floating down the Danube, I have arrived in Vienna.  When I got off the boat in Vienna I looked around and realized there was no info. booth, no currency exchange, nothing. Just a subway. But nowhere to get Euros. Luckily an Irish guy took pity on me and bought me a subway ticket, so I was on my way. Thank goodness for the kindness of strangers.  I had the best of intentions this morning-booked in for the 8 am boat, with an alarm set to 6:20. I don't think my bunkmates like my alarm any more than my neighbors do at home. I hate that I can't wake up-let's keep blaming it on pm kindergarten, shall we?  My inability to wake up was probably prompted by a night out on the town drinking and talking with many backpackers. I had a few gin and tonics although, sadly, no buckets were to be had. Not everywhere can be Thailand.  Anyhow, Budapest rocks. There was easily a thousand or two happy Hungarians dancing, playing games, and drinking at the club we were at last night. Easily. A Monday night. Who knew? I can barely find 10 people on a Monday  night, let alone a crowd. But in Budapest, they go out, even on a Monday. Why aren't Americans more fun?  So I woke up at noon, literally dashed out of the hostel, and arrived to the boat check in breathless at 12:30. When I handed my passport over, the guy looked at it, then me, then said, "You were supposed to be here at 8, no?" Busted. Thank god for being young and female and in a halter top. You can get a lot done. I just smiled and shrugged sheepishly, and they ushered me on board. Yay.  Tomorrow morning I'm going to go on an organized tour of Vienna, and hopefully the tour will really be on this time. I'm excited-I had no idea the museum district was so immense here. There's a new contemporary art tower with work by James Turrell and Jenny Holzer, so hopefully I can find that. I'm trying to get in touch with Joanne's friend Mike's friend Niko, whom I've never met, but in the spirit of true cultural curiousity I think it'd be good fun to hang out with a local, so I'm calling him at work tomorrow. Why not? Time to let someone else use the internet for a change, I've been hogging it trying to get a flight to Croatia. I'm trying to avoid a long bus ride. After the one from Bangkok to Siem Reap (Jo, you know what's up with that), I'm reluctant to do much travelling in a recently war-torn nation.  Thanks to those who emailed me today.

      disclaimer: the keys are all moved around so if i have skipped a few commas, forgive me  hello again. this morning was unfortunate followed by fortunate plans. i rushed to a church to meet up with my hungarian communist tour people, only to find that i was using an old flyer and had missed the tour altogether. damn! i was so looking forward to seeing where they used to wait in banana lines, etc.  but, the good news is while i was waiting i met a london traveller who said something about floating down the danube to vienna. i was inspired, so after some looking ive booked myself on a boat to vienna tomorrow morning up the danube river. i am so excited. it might be a bit expensive, but who knows how much 75 euros really is, anyway?  those who have seen my overly anal planning should note that i have thrown all of my plans out the window, and have hardly been here half a week!  gotta go, my time has run out. more later. email me if you have time! tonight: wine cellars with an australian teacher

      Location: Budapest - Day 3 Number of people who slept in my dorm room last night: 13 Number of those who snored: 3 Number of people who were actually asleep at 3 am in my room: 1 # of times I've been busted for riding a bus without paying: 1  So, as you can tell, I've landed myself in quite the party hostel. Two 19 year olds just asked if I'm in college. Yikes. Despite it being loud, though, I've been having an excellent time; I've met tons of cool people and even had a taste of home when the resident cat, Tiger, scratched me as I tried to remove him from my bunk bed. I miss Elliot.  So, the first day I arrived it was raining. I tried to fight jet lag and wander around in the rain, which was fun, but wet, so I quickly invested in a Hungarian umbrella. Yesterday, my first real day as I hadn't slept for over 30 hours on Friday and was therefore zombified, was great. I met a cool girl from Ireland and we ended up spending the whole day together. We saw an ancient castle, museum, wandered across the Danube, had countless beers, and then decided to go check out a club. Well. Let me tell you, Hungarians really know how to get down.  As we approached the club we noticed thousands of people milling the waterfront; there was a party boat docked there, and tons of tiny makeshift bars, with people dancing in the streets and dancing. Why can't we drink in the streets at home? It was really fun, but I have to tell you, Hungarians cannot dance. Oh well.  Then, after getting woken up at 6 am by the couple above me in the bunk bed (note: they're only supposed to book one person per bed, but as this is summer camp, well...), I quickly changed rooms. Now I'm in the jungle room. They're all about themes here. Soon I will be crashing on a bed, in a room with only 4 people! I'm so excited.  Today was your typical lazy Sunday; we boarded the tram, found our way across town, and hung out all afternoon at a magnificent Turkish bath. I dunked in numerous pools of different temperatures, sunbathed, and was only approached by  one  sketchy old man offering to give me a message. I declined.  I'd include pictures but the disgruntled hostel worker doesn't know what a USB port is. Tomorrow: a walking tour of Communist Hungary, complete with Stalin statues and a visit to an old factory. Then, more baths, probably.
