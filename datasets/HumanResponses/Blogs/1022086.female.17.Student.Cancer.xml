      All right, I officially live in THE nut house. As in, THE nut house. Like, really.    Last night I was kicking back and relaxing. Clint came over to join Ale and I in finally viewing  Cowboy Bebop, the Movie . So yeah. Good stuff. *Flashback*  We're sitting around and talking before playing the movie, and suddenly, Clint says, "There's a red, flashy light outside your window." Puzzled, we look out the window, and there are a firetruck and ambulance in my driveway. Ale and I look at each other and simultaneouly say, "Abuelita," (that means "grandma" in Spanish) and rush downstairs to find my uncle and the 911 folks. My grandmother is moaning and whining worse than an old dog in pain would, and the ambulance guy, Scott, whom I know well by now (sad, eh?) waves at me. We realize that we're just in the way and go back upstairs. A bit later, my mom calls from the hospital (my uncle has called her up and told her what's happened, evidently) and tells us that grandma fell down the stairs-- again. Anyway, we proceed to watch the movie. The animation is awesome and the storyline sad as usual. It's pretty good, but I preferred the series to it. The series was simply majestic.   While Clint is in the kitchen exchanging his final goodbyes for the weekend with my sister, I pet Shah and discover that he's lost an unbelievable amount of weight. He is very much skinnier than he used to be. I don't think he's been eating much, and anyone could tell that lately he's been down. So, I think my poor kitty is so depressed that he's not eating now. Great.    At about 2.30 am I roll into bed. I set my alarm clock for 12.00. I sleep and wake up at 12 but decide that I could just get up at 12.30; that'll be better. About 12.15, my sister jumps in and pokes at me. I went to bed not feeling too good since I haven't been feeling well all week; therefore, having to watch her jump gives me nausea. She then proceeds to take my blankets and pillows away just for spite, making me fall out of bed. At this point, I whine out in agony, and after an extended battle, I am able to kick her out of my room, go back to bed, and lie there until 1.20 . So, then, I get up and enjoy some wondrous mellow music. Am still in considerably good mood.   I go to the kitchen to make my coffee and discover that my grandmother downstairs is screeching in supposed pain, as she has been doing all night. Obviously, my mom is highly annoyed. I don't blame her, but I, too, get annoyed with the situation as well as my mom's bitchiness. I tell her I have some 60-something Chemistry problems left to do by Monday to go along with a test over them as well as a few chores to complete, yet she starts listing things I need to do for her. I'm about to say, "I'll try," but before I can get past, "I'll," she splenetically says, "All right, never mind. You're just like your sister. Simply can't ask either one of you to do anything." At this point, I'm almost over the fence. So, I say, "I do too do things for you, thank you very much! And you didn't even let me finish speaking!!" I don't know how I managed to storm out like that and live to tell the story; this has to be the first time in history. Any other time something of the like has happened, I've been vituperated or grounded, if not worse. So, I go to my room to straighten a few things while I wait on my coffee to be ready, and I find my sister splattering paint all over the place (she was frescoing for a class). There is red paint all over the white bathroom door, and I get annoyed, because obviously, I will be the one who will have to clean it in all eventuality.   Then I go to the kitchen to drink my coffee. At that point, daddy decides to have fun with my brain by means of his incoherence. And he is   really   savoring my frustration. So, I snap out of my mind and just leave.    I live with a sporadically snappy artist, a melodramatic hypochondriac, a depressed cat, a manic-depressive uber-stressed materialist (oh, how I hate materialism), and a mentally ill other. And then folks tell me that my house isn't  all that bad  as far as preposterousness goes? My sister decided to minor in psychology. She claims I really am obsessive compulsive, and the more time passes, the more I think she may be correct. Oh, yeah, and I'm a teenager, and sadly enough, the stereotypes are true, and the teenage years suck in every way, particularly when you're nowhere near where you want to be.     "She's Electric" by Oasis    She's electric  She's in a family full of eccentrics  She done things I never expected  And I need more time  She's got a sister  And god only knows how I've missed her  On the palm of her hand is a blister  And I need more time   And I want you to know  I've got my mind made up now  But I need more time  And I want you to say  Do you know what I'm saying?  But I need more ....  Coz I'll be you and you'll be me  There's lots and lots for us to see  There's lots and lots for us to do  She is electric, can I be electric too?   She's got a brother  We don't get on with one another  But I quite fancy her mother  And I think that she likes me  She's got a cousin  In fact she's got 'bout a dozen  She's got one in the oven  But it's nothing to do with me   And I want you to know  I've got my mind made up now  But I need more time  And I want you to say  Do you know what I'm saying?  But I need more ....  Coz I'll be you and you'll be me  There's lots and lots for us to see  There's lots and lots for us to do  She is electric, can I be electric too?

      I'm a very, very, very annoyed camper right this second. I think I need to start an official "I Hate" list, so here goes 1. I hate this stupid keyboard and the way it squeaks.  2. I hate that my grandmother won't shut up and leave me alone. 3. I hate that I can't move without someone telling me what to do or what I need to do. 4. I hate cold weather. 5. I hate television and the fact that there always has to be at least one on in this house. 6. I hate the stupid Spanish channel. Moreover, I hate the stupid Spanish soap operas that my grandmother just HAS to watch. 7. I hate having a perennially PMS'ing/ menopausing/ whatever her problem is choral director. 8. I hate the lack of encouragement I'm getting for my wanting to pursue a musical career.  9. I hate stupid mathematical mistakes. 10. I hate masochism. 11. I hate braces. 12. I hate tooth cement. 13. I hate bad, idiotical, no-point songs such as Good Charlotte's stuff. 14. I hate it when people are mean. 15. I hate waking up at 6.30 on most mornings. 16. I hate US History. 17. I hate falseness. 18. I hate being annoyed. 19. I hate being in pain. 20. I hate it when my cat starts meowing incessantly.  I suppose I should make an "I Like" list to compensate for the negativity I just released.  1. I like my hair. 2. I like cafe mochas and nearly every other coffee product. 3. I like music. 4. I like it when folks just logically get over things and cooperate.  5. I like to sleep. 6. I like astronomy. 7. I like feeling clean. 8. I like the song I'm listening to. 9. I like being with people I care about. 10. I like being cared for.  11. I like the rare, wondrous evenings in which I have no mandatory work to do. 12. I like the sea. 13. I like warm weather. 14. I like chemistry, sometimes. 15. I like feeling good.  16. I like extra credit.  17. I like tiramisu`. 18. I like not being at NHS. 19. I like deep, meaningful conversations that cause one to speculate the other party's inner thoughts and feelings, which are sometimes unspoken but always have the obvious tendency to characterize everything about that person. 20. I like the ceilings in my home. I wish I could turn the house upside down.      Hey, that really did feel better!   Today's been exasperating, and up until a few minutes ago, I was very upset and irritated.   But I feel better.   I woke up late but made it to school on time, beating my ultimate record and taking 15 minutes to take a shower and get ready.   So, I got to school and went to the chemistry room. Sarah walked in a few minutes later and said, "Francesca! You forgot rehearsal!"  Puzzled, I replied, "We didn't have rehearsal today!!!" "Yes, we did?" "OH MY DEAR GOD!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS!!??" "Yes!!!"  I swear, Bizarth never mentioned there being rehearsal today. She really didn't. Sarah said that the only reason she knew was that Bizarth mentioned it Sunday at church; I don't go to Bizarth's same church.... -.-    I don't know just HOW everyone else knew, but I didn't. Anyway, I heard that B was rather ticked off and is evidently going to start kicking people out for being tardy. So, yeah, that. I'm the master of tardiness, but I'm upset that she is so mad about something that was HER fault. How can she be furious of my missing rehearsal if no one even told me we HAD rehearsal???   Besides that, I felt sick all day. Chemistry was all right, History was boring, and I need to work on a stupid project tonight as well as study for a stupid test.   At lunch, I found out that some folks I knew are proud masochists. I found that fairly disturbing.   Calculus was overly rushed, as Mrs. Dunn decided to throw a bunch of information at us all at once while talking even more quickly than she normally does. So, I shall have fun doing homework tonight.   I left early to go to the orthodontist appointment. The secretary/assistant lady had told me that half my braces would come off today last time I saw her. Well, she lied. I was expecting either the top or bottom half to come off, but all that's been liberated is my molar teeth, essentially. I know it's better than nothing, but I still have a week to wait, and my free teeth are still covered in cement that the assistant didn't bother to remove.   Egh. Just egh. I want a good day to happen, really. I took some pills, and I still feel pretty awful. I think I might go lie down for a little while, seeing as it's really starting to hurt now.    Mooo!!    "Vegetable"  by Radiohead   I never wanted anything but this I tried hard, worked hard I ran around in domestic bliss I fought hard, died hard  Everytime you're running over me Everytime you're running I can see  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself  I never wanted any broken bones Scarred face, no home Your words surround me and I asphyxiate And I burn all hate  Everytime you're running out on me Everytime you're running I can see  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself  The waters break, the waters run all over me The waters break, the waters run And this time you're gonna pay  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself...

      Wow. I feel so unbelievably young. I'm lively, full of potential, and with an entire life ahead of me. Why am I tired? Maybe it all derives to a lack of sleep (what I mean is the deeper end of the word  tired ).

      Ahh... Now, this is what I call life. After a long, mean day, I am able to come home and eat overly good food and not have to do ANYTHING!!! That's right! For the first time in a very long time, I don't have any mandatory work for tomorrow. I will still get a few things done, but I can take my time! Not only that, but also I'm eating tostones (fried plaintains--- GOOD) while listening to an awesome, awesome song. (Damien Rice-- "Volcano").  Today was... well, it was not too gooded. I didn't feel good for most of the day at all. Mostly muscular pain. At one point at the beginning of calculus, I couldn't move and almost cried. Luckily, Kayla had some painkillers, and that helped me GREATLY, as I didn't have anything with me.   In Chemistry, we worked problems and bent glass. That was fun. I had done it priorly in first year Chemistry, but I had fun once again, and, like last year, I fused a piece of glass into a neat, twisted work of art. Once again like last year, I gave my creation to Coleman, afraid of getting in trouble with the school for having glass. *Rolls eyes* Sigh.  History was very boring, but I lived. I had fun doing some Watkins-bashing with Philip during lunch. I daresay that he almost hates her more than I hated her. Calculus was eh. I had a quiz and missed one of the multiple choice questions; I'm sure I did because I heard Mrs. Dunn explaining it to someone after class. I really hope that was the only one I missed, considering that there were only 10 questions on the quiz... On the bright side, I got my last quiz back, and I made a 100! This is miraculous because this is my first perfect quiz since the beginning of the semester. I missed the feeling of confidence a 100 brings.   Mrs. Bizarth had jury duty today; therefore, she wasn't in choir. We had a funny sub with an attitude, and that was midly entertaining. She was really nice to me, so that's all that mattered to me. Hehe. Well, anyway, Bizarth left one of those overly idiotic videos for us to watch and fill out worksheets about-- melody and rhythm. I would have appreciated videos regarding some more advanced theory instead... =-*    Anyway, Kim and I essentially talked all period and BS'd our way through the stupid assignment, as no part of it was valuable knowledge in any way-- not even trivial.   Had a pretty interesting nonsensical conversation with Sandra after school.   Came home. Am eating. W00t!!!    Okay. Yay. I'm in so much a better mood now that I'm home and can relax and do everything at my own time. Okay, I guess I'll go relax now. Maybe even play some Tekken Tag or something. Roo!   (Hmmm... this song would be great to skate to-- "Born Too Slow" by Crystal Method. I feel like skating now.)   "Volcano" by Damien Rice  Don't hold yourself like that You'll hurt your knees I kissed your mouth and back But that's all I need Don't build your world around volcanoes melt you down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for the sea  Don't throw yourself like that In front of me I kissed your mouth your back Is that all you need? Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for what I give to you Is just what i'm going through This is nothing new No no just another phase of finding what I really need Is what makes me bleed And like a new disease she's still too young to treat Volcanoes melt me down She's still too young I kissed your mouth You do not need me

      Reminder to self: just because I  can  sing low bass notes doesn't mean I  should . I'm not a guy, and I'm therefore not a bass. Hence, I shouldn't attempt to sing notes so far beyond my range.   If Kim's reading this, she's likely disapproving. I know, I know. I did it again. I hurt my throat trying to sing a low bass note.   I was singing along to Blur, and I can sing along with Damon just fine, but... well, his voice is rather low, and I hit a note that was waaaaaaay beyond my range, and that really hurt. I really need to cut it out, or I will ruin my throat badly.   *sigh* Okay, I'm done now.

      Mmm... his voice is so soothing. If only they'd play the Coldplay versions of Christmas carols at Christmas, I would not grow tired of them. Anyway, I'm slacking again. The plan was to start homework in half an hour, but I still have to clean my bathroom, vacuum a bit, and shower, so... yeah.  There is a possibility of our adopting a homeless kitten to keep Shah company. He seems truly lonely and depressed, and I frankly don't think he would harm a kitten. However, I'm still a tad bit concerned, for should I be wrong, I'd be putting the cat in danger. The idea was not even mine-- surprisingly, it was my mom's. I'm not too sure I'm comfortable with the idea of subjecting another innocent cat to a tempestuously disastrous environment such as my home's; my family is, indeed, quite an odd one.   My mom and I have been pretty good friends for the past few weeks again. It's kind of odd. I know that something's bound to happen to ruin that, for it always does, but then everything's relative and periodical. Well, I should likely go do stuff now (maybe by 5 pm I'll start homework?) Anyone reading this, have a great and blessed week.  The following is my absolute favourite Tori Amos song. It is beautiful, passionate, and a joy to perform.      "Cooling" by Tori Amos  Maybe I didn't like to hear But I still can't believe Speed Racer is dead So then I thought I'd make some plans But fire thought She'd really rather be water instead  And Peggy got a message for me From Jesus And I've heard every word That she was saying And I know I have been Driven like the snow  This is cooling Faster than I can This is cooling Faster than I can  So then Love walked up to Like And said, "I know that you don't like me much. Let's go for a ride." This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree  And is your place in heaven  Worth giving up These kisses These, yeah These kisses?  And Peggy got a message for me From Jesus And I heard every word  That she had said  And I know that I have been Driven like the snow  But this is cooling This is cooling Faster than I can This is cooling Faster than I can  Yes, this is cooling This is cooling

      I sincerely overslept exceedingly today. Of course, it was to be expected, but I'm a completely different case, so I halfway hoped, in some desperate fashion, that not setting an alarm and still managing to get up at 10 after not having slept for a week would still come to fact somehow. Realistically, I'm fine, as I don't really have to go anywhere today. However, I finally crashed at around 3.00 am (first stupid move) and awoke at 2.00 pm although I lay there for 40 solid minutes. Therefore, my head now hurts beyond belief, and most of the day is already gone. I need to do a bit of cleaning and then get working on chemistry, calculus, and some applications. Mech.    Yesterday was an odd day. I shan't put a negative nor positive connotation to it. I suppose that the highlight involved kicking some major Tekken Tag butt, but then Lyndsey beat me at SC II by a few matches, an event which caused me to release the week's exasperations into hapless shrieking. While the aforementioned served the purpose of stress-relief well, it wasn't a very smart thing for me to do, as my throat is now very sore, and I need to get working on All State music, apart from the fact that I have to sing at least 90 minutes daily.    I'm just glad I'm not at school right now. As you may imagine, the ever-so-strong hatred for NHS persists. Well, I suppose I should go grab some form of aliment and go from there. Er, song... Well, listening to it now, and it's good, so   "Loser" by Beck    In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie with the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose kill the headlights and put it in neutral stock car flamin with a loser and the cruise control baby's in Reno with the vitamin D got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat someone came in sayin I'm insane to complain about a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt don't believe everything that you breathe you get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve so shave your face with some mase in the dark savin all your food stamps and burnin down the trailer park Yo. Cut it.  Soy unperdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?  Forces of evil on  a bozo nightmare ban all the music with a phony gas chamber cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag one's on the pole, shove the other in a bag with the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job the daytime crap of the folksinger slob he hung himself with a guitar string a slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin from a pigeon wing you can't write if you can't relate trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate and my time is a piece of wax fallin on a termite that's chokin on the splinters  Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

      Hm. Today has been... a day. I woke up uber-late and missed 45/50 minutes of Women's Ensemble rehearsal; the results consisted of a rather long speech about tardiness and making an effort to be there on time-- particularly those of us who are perennially late (Ms. Bizarth's stare shifted from Sarah to me alternatively as she communicated her concern). Then Chemistry. It was pretty decent for the first half of the block although I was still attempting to awaken, but eventually I started feeling rather awful. I took some pills. History... er, well, there was a test, and I didn't really exactly prepare for it too well, and History is possibly my worst subject. I'm not sure that went as well as I'd hoped. Calculus was pretty fun. I took a quiz, too, and I felt pretty confident about it *knock on wood*. Choir was... hm. So-and-so. I've had to start bringing a can of Dr. Pepper to school with me because I run out of energy by the time fourth block rolls around. Yesterday, I gulped it down in the six minutes that we are allowed for class change--immediately before chorus. Bad idea. Today, I was smarter and drank it during lunch, over the course of half an hour. I think it worked out far better, as I was awake in AP Quackulus AND Chorus!      I got home from a French Club meeting a while ago, and it was pretty fun. We made chocolate mousse. I didn't really know what to do; I was mainly the cleaning person. Patrick made the mousse in our group, mostly. He let me do some of the mixing, and even then he had to tell me exactly what to do, as I am culinarily challenged. It was kind of fun to watch him throw dirty looks at Craddock, who was being his annoying, jerkish self to him. It seemed as though Patrick really wanted to bash his head in. I would have helped him. ^.^  Well, I'd better go eat dinner and get some homework done.     "Sing me to heaven" by Jane Griner   In my heart's sequestered chambers Lie truths stripped of poet's gloss. Words alone are vain and vacant and my heart is mute. In response to aching silence Memory summons half-heard voices, And my soul finds primal eloquence and wraps me in song.  If you would comfort me, sing me a lullaby. If you would win my heart, sing me a love song. If you would mourn me and bring me to God, Sing me a reequiem, sing me to heaven.  Touch in me grief and comfort; Love and passion, pain and pleasure. Sing me a lullaby, a love song, a requiem. Love me, comfort me, bring me to GOd: Sing me a love song, Sing me to heaven.

      All right. I'm calling it vent time. Bad. BAD. BAD!!! Bad. Okay, well, I'm working on calculus, and I keep making tiny, stupid mistakes. I sense another bad grade coming my way (quiz tomorrow). Of course, the Oxford Traditions people are being ever-so-horrid and making my application nearly impossible, and I am so mad at them for the email that I received today that I am considering not attending their stupid program after all. Of course, I go to my room to get some things that I'd left in certain places, and *poof* everything's gone. I suppose that either a) my papers magically sprang legs and left    or b) someone moved my stuff which is very likely, though no one will admit the crime. All sorts of applications and junk that I need to do and learn and understand and bleah are just driving me insane.  Calculus is frustrating me beyond belief; I keep losing points because of stupid, tiny mistakes. I'm not even sure my grade in there is an A anymore.   In light of recent events, I realize that there is a possibility of my having to take the TOEFL. It is a test given to foreign students to prove they're stupid and cannot proceed in their studies, normally administered by Satan (the College Board). Fortunately, many are able to prove Satan incorrect. Although I know it would likely be no biggie for me to pass this test as I think I possess a decent English vocabulary, I'm still irritated by the thought of yet ANOTHER test to stress me out-- as though SAT's and ACT's and AP exams and all that jazz weren't enough.    I'm really tired, and I feel awful. I hurt everywhere. Every single muscle on my body feels as though it were about to tear. No, it's not an exaggeration-- I really feel rather awful.   Just blah. Eeeeek. Ew. Mech.   My apologies for a most pathetic post, but then, you didn't really have to read it after all, you know... You saw the title.      "All I Really Want" by Alanis Morissette   Do I stress you out My sweater is on backwards and inside out And you say how appropriate I don't want to dissect everything today I don't mean to pick you apart you see But I can't help it There I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off Slap me with a splintered ruler And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already If only I could hunt the hunter  And all I really want is some patience A way to calm the angry voice And all I really want is deliverance Do I wear you out You must wonder why I'm so relentless and all strung out I'm consumed by the chill of solitary I'm like Estella I like to reel it in and then spit it out I'm frustrated by your apathy And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land If only I could meet the Maker  And I am fascinated by the spiritual man I am humbled by his humble nature What I wouldn't give to find a soulmate Someone else to catch this drift And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses Falling all around...all around Why are you so petrified of silence Here can you handle this?  Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines Or when you think you're gonna die Or did you long for the next distraction And all I need know is intellectual intercourse A soul to dig the hole much deeper And I have no concept of time other than it is flying If only I could kill the killer  All I really want is some peace man a place to find a common ground And all I really want is a wavelength All I really want is some comfort A way to get my hands untied And all I really want is some justice...

      I know it's all right to be a disaster and that it's good to amuse people, but every now and then it gets kind of depressing. Anytime I do something well, the next thing I do is trip on my face. It's insane.   Sure, it's funny, but it gets kind of old sometimes that every time that a crash is heard in Chemistry class everyone turns toward me as an automatic response, or that anytime a thump or crash is heard at home someone is bound to yell out, "Francesca, are you all right?"  Eh, I'll get right over it in a minute. Just a tad... [insert adjective that I cannot think of here].

      So, today I had an appointment with Dr. Morris. I wasn't very happy to go visit him, for, you know, it's been 3-3.5 years now, and I'm kind of fed up with oral apparatuses in general. My appointment was at 10.30 am, and because school was out today, the office was super-busy. So, at 11.something Morris finally approaches me...   And what does he say?  He says I'm ready to get the braces off!!!  I jumped and rejoiced, amusing likely all present at the office, but I believed (and still do) that I had every right to be utterly psyched.  Next Tuesday, half of the metal will be removed. The remainders are coming off the Monday after.   I am so very excited and happy and yayefied!!!  No braces = life improvement. How, you ask? Well, if you have to ask, you've obviously never had to wear braces.   1. No more pain. 2. No more food stuck in between the braces. 3. Better tooth brushability. 4. Increased number of toothbrushes spared/ toothbrush conservation. 5. Less conductivity of electricity. 6. Less gum sensibility. 7. (*Sings*)"No more tears, no more suffering, no more fears as we cross into the light!" 8. Better unstickability of chewing/bubble gum/candy to braces.  9. Less weight to bear. 10. Probability of flags getting stuck to teeth lowered. 11. Mouth liberation. 12. Better singing capabilities (once the braces are off, he can't put anymore elastics in!!!) 13. I could go on forever, you know.  But I really need to do some homework and a few other tasks as I return to school tomorrow, unfortunately.    ^.^ *dances* The braces will be removed!!! Weeeeeeeeeee!!!    "On a Wonderful Day like Today" by Matt Monro  On a wonderful day like today I defy any cloud to appear in the sky Dare any rain drop to plop in my eye On a wonderful day like today   On a wonderful morning like this When the sun is as big as a yellow balloon Even the sparrows are singing in tune On a wonderful morning like this   On a morning like this I could kiss everybody  I'm so full of love and goodwill Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody to come and dine The pleasure's mine and I will pay the bill   May I take this occasion to say That the whole human race should go down on its knees Show that we're grateful for mornings like these For the world's in a wonderful way On a wonderful day like today   On a morning like this I could kiss everybody  I'm so full of love and goodwill Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody to come and dine The pleasure's mine and I will pay the bill   May I take this occasion to say That the whole human race should go down on its knees Show that we're grateful for mornings like these For the world's in a wonderful way On a wonderful day like today

      Wow! I cooked something two nights in a row!!! I'm extravagantly proud. While the first attempt to produce something edible last night was successful but didn't taste very good, today's result was far closer to what I wanted it to be. Yesterday, Jessica came over to work on chemistry. We didn't exactly do as many chemistry problems as we had hoped to because we decided to cook some pasta. I called my mom to obtain instructions to make the sauce. Mind you, it would have turned out great if we'd used the right kind of Pomi. We used the type that has bits of whole tomato still in it as opposed to the utterly liquefied type. Nonetheless, the pasta was edible. Too bad that the sauce wasn't very rich.   Today I craved rice like crazy. I didn't want my grandmother's normal recipe although it is good; I wanted "rice in white" with lemon in it. So, I made it, and I'm satisfied with the results. I should have added one more lime to it for it to be perfect for me, but I think that, for a first time, I did well. My grandmother initially wanted to help me, but when she began criticizing my every move, I became highly irritated and kindly told her I could do it myself. I know that was still slightly mean, but it was  my  rice, you know?   I find that I have developed a habit for eating rice with chopsticks. It just doesn't seem logical to me to use anything but chopsticks to consume rice with anymore.    Anyhow, I am ready for college now.   1. I can do my own laundry. 2. I can cook rice, pasta, eggs, grits, French toast, and microwaveable foods. 3. I am a fond PS2er. 4. I can iron clothes effectively. 5. I can fix some electrical circuits.   I am capable of other things, too, but that seems like a pretty good essentials list to me. Don't you agree?   Well, on that note, I need to go clean up and, if I ever finish winnowing the general disaster in the northeasternmost direction of the house (my room and bathroom) into place, do homework.   Sajonara!   Oh, song! Almost forgot. Er, well, I'm listening to it now and I really like it, so   "It's My Life" by No Doubt    It's funny how I find myself In love with you If I could buy my reasoning I'd pay to lose One half won't do  I've asked myself How much do you Commit yourself?  It's my life Don't you forget It's my life It never ends (It never ends...)  Funny how I blind myself I never knew If I was sometimes played upon Afraid to lose  Oh, I'd tell myself What good do you do Convince myself  Oh, It's my life Don't you forget Oh, It's my life It never ends (It never ends...)  And I've asked myself How much do you Commit yourself?  It's my life Don't you forget Caught in the crowd It never ends (its my life)  It's my life Don't you forget Caught in the crowd It never ends (It never ends)  Oh, It's my life... (oh its my life) Don't you forget... (don't you forget) Caught in the crowd... (caught in the crowd) It never ends (it never ends...)

      I dare say that yesterday was the best day of the week. My school day was rather peaceful, and I even got to mathercise!!! Then, after school, Lyndz and I picked up Tekken Tag at EB games and played. Good times. She kicked my butt at SC II --very badly, too, but then I really kicked her butt at Tekken Tag, so 'twas "all nice on ice, all right." Last night we went to Hastings and found potential additions for our gaming group. The subjects in question are Jake Martitius and Jack... er... Mullins? They're both pretty cool folks, and they are exactly the kind of gamers we need: excited, fun, obsessed, and neat. They, of course, seem as though they would kick our butts at, pretty much, just about anything in one minute, but as soon as we will have gotten back into the gaming gear and mindset and embodied decency as matches, this should be fun. I'm excited. Driving back from Hastings, we realized that the sky was at its loftiest beauty-- more astounding than I'd seen it in, probably, years. We debated waiting until the next night to skywatch but didn't want to jeopardize our chances of ever seeing such a spectacular firmament again; therefore, we went to my house to recuperate my telescope under the decision that I'd spend the night, as she lives away from the road and on a hill-- the immaculate place to skywatch. It took us aproximately an hour or so to get everything set up and ready to go, and after much impatience, we discovered that Autostar was not going to function because the batteries I'd inserted were evidently low (even though I had honestly believed they were still brand new... time=corrosion... frustration... bad.) Anyway, we wound up utilizing the telescope manually. The latter was both a good and a bad thing. The bad perspective made me realize just how very little I remembered of what I once knew and believed to be obvious knowledge; I couldn't be a very good guide for us, as I didn't even find any of my good star charts immediately when getting my stuff at home. The good that resulted is that I am re-inspired. I need to get back into shape astronomically. Seriously.    I slept wonderfully, for a change. I didn't wake up a single time throughout the course of the night. Had good breakfast, got ready, and went back to EB games, and now I'm home, having to do some cleaning soon and then awaiting Jessica so as to crack the chemistry books together (mooooooooo!!!).  Lyndsey's parents are the newest epitomes of generosity in my book. They bought $11 worth of candy from me in less than 24 hours. Because I really need to sell candy to help me afford all state, I am eternally grateful.    On that note, I got 5/7 of my music. I was placed into the Senior Women's choir. I'm slightly disappointed... I really wanted to be in 11th and 12th mixed, but I can deal with it; I'm just happy to be going to all state (granted that I make the second audition-- Gosh, I hope I do.) Eric Nelson is the director, and although I have never had him as a director, I have been given many good reports about him. The music seems so-and-so, but I'll likely come to love at least most of it in all eventuality, I hope? I can't start studying it quite yet because Ms. Bizarth lost the sheet with the voice assignments on it; each part splits up even more. Therefore, I can't exactly study the Alto I part. There's Alto I a, b, and c on most of the music, I think. I haven't really looked at it. I suppose I could start looking at the unison Alto I parts, though.     Tomorrow is Lyndsey's seventeenth barfday. Happy day, Lyndz!!!   She had some emptry Crown (Canadian Whiskey?) bottles, and when I told her that I'd never had whiskey before, she told me to drink the last drop. Being an ignorant fool, I did so. OUCH. A drop nearly knocked me out. It burnt like crap.    This song has been in my head for a fair portion of the week. It's got a good point, too.    "What I Got"  by Sublime   Early in the mornin' Risin' to the street Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet Got to find a reason Reason things went wrong Got to find the reason why my money's all gone I got a Dalmatian  I can still get high I can play the guitar like a mother fucking riot.  Life is (too short) So love the one you got Cause you might get run over or you might get shot Never start no static I just get it off my- chest Never had to battle with no bulletproof- vest Take a small example Take a tip from me..  Take all of your money and give it up to charity Lovin's what I got It's within my reach And the Sublime style is still straight from Long Beach It all comes back to you you're bound to get what you deserve Try and test that, you're bound to get served Love's what I got Don't start a riot You feel it when the dance gets hot.  Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that. Lovin', is what I got, and remember that. Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that. Lovin', is what I got, I got, I got.  Why I don't cry when my dog runs away I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot Hits that bottle and goes right to the rock Fuckin and fighting, it's all the same livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me.

      What a disgusting week this has been thus far! I have felt like a solid piece of excrement for the past few days and performed worse scholastically. I failed my first AP chemistry chapter test ever, and although I had initially believed that I'd learned how to be apathetic about failure or discontent, the sadness kicked in later, but I'm getting over it. Actually, my biggest concern lately is Calculus. Suddenly, I don't understand what's going on anymore. I'm utterly lost. I was supposed to be the math person--therefore, this wasn't supposed to happen. I have a test tomorrow, and I don't even know how I will manage to get through there. My last report card was wonderful, but I am doubting more and more that I'll ever see those beautiful grades in my AP classes again; I'm just too burnt out. I would have needed Christmas break to last at least a month longer than it did, but I only got the two weeks I got. My brain decided then to take a vacation but evidently refused to come home, and I'm struggling.    I just feel quite awful these days. Again. No one, but no thing, either. It's rather sad, as at least earlier I was able to get things done. I need to get my brain back and get it back in gear, though I'm not too sure how that's supposed to happen.   And I'd better hope that the remaining two days of the week won't be as lousy as these first three.    I'm supposed to get All State music tomorrow, as it's come in, finally. I'm really hoping that I will like it, that way I'll work on it with no problem, or something like that anyway. I don't even know what the repertoire is yet. I'm selling candy to fundraise for that, as All State's a buttload of money *sigh*. Fundraisers are kind of annoying. Hopefully, I won't screw that up, too.    "End of a Century" by Blur   She said there's ants in the carpet Dirty like monsters Eating all the morsels Picking up the rubbish Give her effervescence She needs a little sparkle Good morning TV You're looking so healthy  We all say Don't want to be alone We wear the same clothes 'Cause we feel the same We kiss with dry lips When we say goodnight End of a century...  Oh, it's nothing special  Sex on the TV Everybody's at it And the mind gets dirty As you get closer to thirty Gives her a cuddle They're glowing in a huddle Good night TV You're all made up And you're looking like me  We all say Don't want to be alone We wear the same clothes 'Cos we feel the same And kiss with dry lips When we say goodnight End of a century...   Oh, it's nothing special  Can you eat her? Yes, you can  We all say Don't want to be alone We wear the same clothes 'Cos we feel the same And kiss with dry lips When we say goodnight End of the century...  Oh, it's nothing special  Oh, end of a century, oh It's nothing special

      I took a test online linked off from a friend's site, and here are the general results. I think it's relatively accurate. I didn't purchase the more in-depth description as I think it's a waste of money to pay for somebody to tell me what I already know.   Yout temperament is Idealist   Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self -- always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.  Idealists are sure that friendly cooperation is the best way for people to achieve their goals. Conflict and confrontation upset them because they seem to put up angry barriers between people. Idealists dream of creating harmonious, even caring personal relations, and they have a unique talent for helping people get along with each other and work together for the good of all. Such interpersonal harmony might be a romantic ideal, but then Idealists are incurable romantics who prefer to focus on what might be, rather than what is. The real, practical world is only a starting place for Idealists; they believe that life is filled with possibilities waiting to be realized, rich with meanings calling out to be understood. This idea of a mystical or spiritual dimension to life, the "not visible" or the "not yet" that can only be known through intuition or by a leap of faith, is far more important to Idealists than the world of material things.  Highly ethical in their actions, Idealists hold themselves to a strict standard of personal integrity. They must be true to themselves and to others, and they can be quite hard on themselves when they are dishonest, or when they are false or insincere. More often, however, Idealists are the very soul of kindness. Particularly in their personal relationships, Idealists are without question filled with love and good will. They believe in giving of themselves to help others; they cherish a few warm, sensitive friendships; they strive for a special rapport with their children; and in marriage they wish to find a "soulmate," someone with whom they can bond emotionally and spiritually, sharing their deepest feelings and their complex inner worlds.  Idealists are rare, making up between 25 and 30 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers.  The Four types of Idealists are:  Healers (INFP) | Counselors (INFJ) | Champions (ENFP) | Teachers (ENFJ)

      It's a beautiful day, and I can't go anywhere as I have to study for tests and do a buttload of work. *Sigh* Oh, well. At least I got to sing for 2/3 of my weekend, and it was definitely worth the time.   I can't go to Spivey Workshop *frown*; I was heading out the door to go to choir and turn in my application on Friday, and Mrs. Dunn decided to inform us that we have a quiz Tuesday and a test Wednesday. I could have dealt with missing both the Chemistry and Quackulus quizzes, but we will be tested on the proofs of the Fundamental Theorems on Wednesday, and because I don't really understand those, I likely don't need to miss class on Tuesday, when she will review and likely answer questions. I hate school so very much. I'm starting to hate math, too, believe it or not... It's not only the fact that I am exorbitantly crushed by my not being able to go to Spivey, but also the fact that it no longer interests me and only seems to frustrate me. Although I love astronomy, it involves massive amounts of mathematics, obviously, and I haven't exactly decided whether I will eventually begin hating Physics, too, once I actually study it in depth.  I am leaning toward the idea of taking Theory again. Erin tells me that the class really is worth it, and she seems really engaged positively in the class. I have not made up my mind yet, but I think I'd enjoy studying theory more than anything else. I will get a final feedback from more people at the end of the year and see how that goes.   My mom really does not seem to like my idea of studying music other than, perhaps, as a minor in college and making it my profession. I don't understand why. Anytime I question her "hmm"s or twisted expressions as I mention a career in music, her answer is "do whatever you like." A career in music does not necessarily involve performance- although if I go into music, it will likely be choral directing. I just don't know what to make out of anything. I have applications to fill out that I have yet not gotten to and don't know exactly when I will, and I'm getting ever more confused by the second.   I just don't want to do something that I'll eventually hate. It has been proven to me that, even if one thinks he or she completely loves something, it often happens that his or her idea changes with time. Music is the only thing that has not disappointed me so thus far in life, and although many will say that it is not a panacea, it really is. I cannot think of a time I am happier to be somewhere than when I am on stage performing, hearing voices being molded by expert hands and realizing that everyone around me feels the same and knowing that I am a part of a phenomenon that can change the life of anyone in the room. And it really is a phenomenon.     Oh, yeah, and my mom is knitting again for the first time in probably 10 years and remembers how to do it perfectly. She's knitting me a throw, and I'm deeply touched. It's multi-shade-and-tint blue.

      Wow. Wow. And wow. Honor Choir this year was absolutely awesome. In my five years of attendance at Honor Chorus, this year was by far the best, and the best director I have ever had in my choral life directed it. Seriously, this guy was amazing. For starters, he had a gorgeous voice, but that's besides the point. It was Dr. Alan Raines, currently conducting at GA State University. He was just marvelously and entirely enraptured by the music and conveyed his feelings in such a fashion that caused us, the singers, to be captivated by the beauty of the harmony and melody and the message we were delivering and the importance of the music, and it was just an extremely fulfilling experience. Rogers once said that the space between the singers and the listeners is sacred ground; I now fully understand that concept. It is so relevant that one places his or her entire self into the music to properly give the listener the message, and it is unbelievable how many listeners out there will, in turn, become infatuated with the music and be profoundly touched by it as it comforts them and carries them through pain and strain and enlightenment and joy.    Dr. Raines went mad during rehearsal to make us understand the music. He would sprint across the room and jump and hum and dum and rattle and shake and scream- he would do just about anything necessary. All the while, he was entirely polite and treated us with respect, which was something that I greatly appreciated. We opened rehearsal by running through the music, and though I had believed that the music in itself was beautiful, I thought it sounded rather dead. He changed this to the opposite end of the spectrum in less than 24 hours. Oh, I can't wait to get my copy of the recording. All the music was wonderful, and I don't think I've sung with so much emotion and meaning in a very long time.   To top that off, I learned some German. "In Stiller Nacht" was a difficult piece, I will have to say, but I am pretty sure that we pulled it off really well. I really hope so, but my mom said that we sounded absolutely great, and she does not give compliments very quickly, so I take it that we did. Mrs. Bizarth said that this was the best Honor Choir concert she'd heard in a few years.   The repertoire consisted of "Hallelujah, Amen" by Handel, "In Stiller Nacht" by Brahms, "O My Luve's Like a Red, Red Rose" by Clausen, "Order My Steps" by Burleigh, and "In Dat Great Gittin' Up Mornin' " by Hairston.  On "Hallelujah, Amen," we practiced with "diggy dum"s to get the buoyancy of the piece going, and we wound up keeping it that way for the concert because it sounded good. The only actual words we sang were "and in songs divine harmonious join" and "amen, hallelujah" at the end. Dr. Raines was hilarious. He stepped on stage and said, "I don't normally like to begin a concert by speaking, but I thought I should inform you that although the program states that the first piece we will be singing is "Halleluja, Amen", we will actually sing a diversion of the words to old English for you. The words are "diggy dum", "diggy" meaning "hallelujah" and "dum" meaning "amen". Thank you." He said all this with the most solemn expression and maintained it as he approached us, even though everyone else broke out into laughter. It was great.   "In Shtiller Nacht" was very difficult but very rewarding. After lots of work on that, we were able to sing the full song in German. It was very intense, and I am now deeply in love with the song and have acquired more knowledge about Brahms and German in general. As a matter of fact, after the concert my mom and I stopped by Publix, and after she bought some beer, Warsteiner, the bagger boy asked us how to pronounce the word, and I was able to tell him the correct pronunciation. That, of course, lead him to question me on my German background, and I simply answered that I'd just learned a song in German. ^.^   "O My Luve..." was just beautiful. We all sang our hearts out, and I'm sure one could tell. The song makes me melt, and we had some really awesome guys in the choir this year, particularly the basses, and the guys' "solo" section almost made me cry.  Side notely, I finally met Hinkle, as the Northgate folks lost their bus for a reason that is still unknown to me and had to ride with us. "Do you know Stephanie Ward?" "Yes" "Are you Hinkle?" "Yes, how'd you know?" Frankly, I don't know how I knew. I just had a feeling he was Hinkle; I knew he was in choir and in my grade, and although there were other NG guys in my choir, he just looked like a Hinkle. He seems like a really nice guy.   And on another note, I don't comprehend the infatuation that everyone appears to have, up to this day, with Shea Henley. I saw him there. He was wearing shades at every single rehearsal-even the dress rehearsal. He removed them for the concert, and I didn't think his eyes were very pretty. I did compliment him on his hair, and although he returned the favour, he still seemed like a bit of a jerkoff to me. The guy standing beside him had saliently beautiful blonde long hair-- even my mom noticed it from the audience, and he stood on the last row. He, too, however, seemed as though he were a jerk. I stood on the second to last of five rows of risers.    On "Order My Steps", we had an awesome soloist. It was a soul piece, and it sounded awesome. Katrina, the soloist, just absolutely kicked a major one. She was unbelievable. The solo involved improvising, and though I'd initially considered trying out, I realized that I'd best leave that to a black girl. Surely enough, Katrina was a large, African American girl, but no one could have done a better job than she did. It turned out that she was the daughter of an ex-nurse of my grandmother; we learned this after the concert. I had talked to the girl during rehersal, and she was very nice.   Although I had initially hated "In Dat...", I came to love it once Dr. Raines taught us how to spice it up. There were two tenor soloists in that piece, and they, too, did a phenomenal job. The piece in general kicked butt.    I sang beside a half Italian girl named Carmela (students are organized by height every year), and she was a fun person to sit by. I got a kick out of it. Of course, once on stage, Alto II's had to stand by me as I was at the end of the Alto I's, and the girl that sang on the other side of me was rude, obnoxious, and added in way more slides than anyone should ever be allowed to ruin music with. She sucked and switched parts according to whichever suited her best at the moment, but oh, well.    I'm so excited. I think I'm going to email the director since I never really got a chance to speak to him because everything was so very rushed.   I didn't get left behind this year, either, and when I thanked Ms. Bizarth for that, she responded with a good, hearty laugh.   It was really eye-opening as far as the passage of time is concerned to watch the younger choirs perform. They were very good, but I couldn't believe I had been there once. It's a strange feeling one gets when he or she stops to think about how far he or she has come.   Initially, I felt really odd about being back at Honor Choir, for Honor Choir is where I essentially met Trey my freshman year. There, I had finally identified the dude with the staring problem at football games. It was just so strange to realize that we had priorly been at the same exact locations (even away from the performing art center) and I had become so honestly infatuated with such an immature guy. I was so stupid. However, these memories were not necessarily bad, for a change. I wasn't depressed because the music made everything worthwhile, and I realized that it's time to be mature and finally really forgive Trey once and for all and move on. I feel a lot more peaceful at the mention of his name than I have felt since the fiasco of a situation that existed and ended in heartbreak.    I am very ready to crash, not having slept enough for a week and having to get up tomorrow and do endless amounts of homework, so I leave you with a song.    "In Stiller Nacht"  Johannes Brahms  (Accents are not in place due to the fact that I'm tired and don't feel like messing with that right now.)    In stiller Nacht, zur ersten Wacht, ein Stimm begunnt zu klagen, In still of night, oh awesome night, a lonely voice is singing,   der nacht'ge Wind hat suss und lind zu mir den Klang getragen; The evening breeze among the trees, to me a sadness bringing.  von herbem Leid und Traurigkeit ist mir das Herz zerflossen,  Throughout my life of pain and strife, my heart is ever broken  die Blumelein, mit Tranen rein hab ich sie all begossen. The blossoms rare weep in despair, for thee in love a token.  Der schone Mond will untergahn,  The friendly moon has gone too soon,   fur Leid nicht mehr mag sheinen,  No more for me aglowing,   die Sternelan ihr Glitzen stan, mit mir sie wollen weinen. The stars once bright are dark at night, their tears with mine are flowing.  Kein Vogelsang, noch Freudenklang man horet in den Luften,  No singing bird aloft is heard, his joyous song is taken,   die wilden Tier raurn auch mit mir Wild creatures mourn alone, forlorn,   in Steinen und in Kluften.  Among the rocks forsaken.   Or two... Clausen wrote the following for his wife. I would melt if anyone ever wrote something like that for me- wouldn't you?   "O My Luve's Like a Red, Red Rose" Music- Rene` Clausen Lyrics- Robert Burns   O my Luve's like a red, red rose,  O my Luve's like a red, red rose  That's newly sprung in June.  O my Luve's like a melodie that's sweetly played in tune.   As fair art thou my bonnie lass so deep in luve am I,  I will luve thee still my dear 'Till a' the seas, 'till a' the seas gang dry.   I will luve thee still my dear,  While the sands of life shall run,  'Till the seas gang dry, my dear,  And rocks melt with the sun.   As fair art thou my bonnie lass, so deep in luve am I, I will luve thee still my dear,  Tho' it were ten thousand,  Tho' it were ten thousand mile.   Tho' it were ten thousand mile.

      I must say that I am in a far better mood than I was in this time yester-day. I was mostly apathetic throughout most of the day because of a general lack of sleep- again. I'm a bit concerned about that issue. I need sleep, and I'm most certainly exhausted at the end of the day- and yet I cannot sleep. I awaken continuously throughout the course of the night, and I finally fall asleep as soon as my alarm clock sounds, but it is too late to do anything at that point.    On a side note, I am infinitely hyped up about Honor Choir this year. I can't wait to go. I love our music muchly (well, excepting one piece), and I have heard great things about the director. I'm generally hopeful and excited to get to do something I love for a weekend. If you're a lover of choral music and have nothing better to do on Saturday night, come to the concert-admission is free. It is at the Clayton County Performing Arts Center at 6.30 pm. Tuesday there will be a Workshop at Spivey Hall for music education and such. I hopefully will be able to attend, as I really want to. I would need to miss an entire school day; therefore, I shall check to be sure that anything I miss will be easily made up. I really really want to go.    I had an intriguing verbal engagement with Katie today. I wasn't sure such a thing could ever happen, but it did, and it was a nice and satisfying conversation with words being spoken on both ends, as opposed to the usual scenario of my speaking until I am dry of speech. We talked about anthropological behavior and overall flaws and virtues as well as modes of communication and expression.   It was rather enlightening, considering that, throughout my school day, I hardly ever have a chance to exchange any meaningful ideas with anyone.    Yesterday, I had to telephone Charter because my internet was acting screwy. The assistance girl who picked up asked me to repeat the process of unplugging all cords from the wall although I had already attempted that route of action. While we were waiting to restart everything, I asked her how she was doing. I assume that this girl was in desperate need to speak her mind to anyone willing to listen, and she did. Synoptically, she and I conversed for approximately 30 minutes. I think we both needed that, and I was immensely grateful that I was able to somehow, even if in such a minuscule way, aid this girl in oh-so-much distress.   Then, I was connected to technical services, and the man I spoke to was rather rude and of no help, as I wound up figuring out the problem on my own anyway after he told me he could not help.    Random thought that popped in my head just now: I am a damsel in distress daily as I attempt to close my locker. And I had earnestly convinced myself that that would change with the new semester...   Well, I should really go begin my homework now. So, I leave you with a bow as I post the lyrics to a marvelous song.    "Smoke" by Ben Folds Five  Leaf by Leaf and page by page Throw this book away All the sadness, all the rage Throw this book away Rip out the binding and tear the glue All of the grief we never ever knew We had it all along  Now it's smoke  The things we've written in it Never really happened All of the people come and gone Never really lived All of the people have come have gone  No one to forgive smoke We will never write a new one There will not be a new one Another one, another one Here's an evening dark with shame Throw it on the fire Here's the time I took the blame Throw it on the fire  Here's the time we didn't speak It seemed for years and years Here's a secret No one will ever know the Reasons for the tears They are smoke  Where do all the secrets live? They travel in the air You can smell them when they burn They travel Those who say the past is not dead Stop and smell the smoke  You keep on saying the past is not dead Come on and smell the smoke You keep saying the past is not even past You keep saying We are smoke

      Well, I'm back again. I feel utter mental incarceration lately, and I am in need of a blog to release my thoughts. Honestly, since school has started, everything has been going downhill. Things I had thought I'd put behind me are resurfacing, my classes are hideously intolerable, and not too much is going right, quite frankly. I've been trying to overlook everything and stay positive, but do you notice that overlooking everything is really hard? So, I'm sitting in calculus attempting to complete an assignment as my boisterous class's members converse exuberantly about nothing with one another, and it hits me:   Mental incarceration is predominant. I'm sitting here, having failed an overly easy homework for unbelievably stupid inattentive mistakes, feeling like slime and wanting to simply vanish because of my approximate geography. I feel tied by everything- my clothing (cold weather is innverving), my classes, the supposed humans surrounding me--the folks near me particularly, throwing me odd looks as I exist, as I breathe, as I'm myself. I wish I had an invisibility cloak right here, right now, and could take my leave.    *Sigh* In all eventuality, I'll become accostumed to my situation and learn how to deal with it, I hope. Things could be about a gazillion times worse, but I can't refrain from detesting the high school world. If it would only end at home... Nothing is wrong, but everything is unbelievably passive, in that cool way that feels almost worse than the heat of a combustion reaction within the boundaries of the home, most likely caused by a heated argument that's happened between my sister and I or my mother and I or perhaps not even involving me.   I don't know whether what I'm experiencing is anger. Anger can be a beautiful thing, as long as it is not utilized as an excuse for destruction. I'm not claiming it that way.                                Have I mentioned that I want to scream at the very top of my lungs?     I think I need a cafe mocha.   And some Bob Marley                                      as I calm down and begin my stupid                                              homework.   And perhaps post a lousy poem of mine.       To Myself  They said to me,  “Little girl, you have a long,  	long way to go.” I said,  “Indeed, my friends, I have a long,  	long way to go.”  “But you’re clever; you’ll excel in many areas,” 		they said. “Oh, but I don’t know,  for you never can tell,” said I.  So is this an egotistical attempt,       a narcissistic disposition to          write a poem to myself,                 for my eyes only,                       to remind myself                           that life is life?                                        Supposedly not,                                   but then, it could be,                            for I could be writing to          somebody else, or about somebody      else- as opposed to writing illogically all over this college ruled morceau de papier                        pezzo di carta                        pedazo de papel-however you say it!             pretending to be a poet.

      Yesterday was fun. I got nearly nothing accomplished because I went out, and it actually helped me feel somewhat better for a little while (I suppose distraction does that).    I had excessive amounts of chocolate as we made brownies at Clint's and whatnot. Everyone left, though, for a bunch of random and unknown reasons.    Anyway, other than the good food (hehehe), I also watched some good movies, although I was forced to leave before the end of one I was really enjoying because of fear of murder from the motherly unit for coming home entirely too late. Luckily, she wasn't up, although I heard an extended unnecessity about it this morning... =-P   Maybe it was the excess of chocolate that made me have such an awful nightmare, as well as the movie that I was watching before we left, which dealt with the Holocaust.  I dreamt that a Nazi, representing the Angel of Death, came to get me. It was very scary. I woke up sweating and sat there a while. I never seem to be able to remember the good dreams; all I ever remember when I actually  reach  REM are the nightmares. I think the last worst two were seeing a beautiful angel in front of me and, suddenly, a staff flying toward its forehead and killing it. Then there was the one in which daddy was abandoned and died in a very strange land. Honestly, my dreams are so messed up. And there was the one in which Grubbs, Jefts, and Johnson locked me in the trunk of a 1960 VW Bug...  yeah, the trunk...   The pondery mood I wound up in led me to the conclusion that life is a pain in the butt in the sense that anything good seems to fade away immediately and the "bad stuff" seems to linger neverendingly, and it sucks. Lately, it seems as though I'm always working... for nothing. However, life moves on, and so must every living organism that's willing to keep up and avoid death.   On that note, I'm going to find a way to get along with Patrick. I don't know quite how yet- I may need to have a talk with him, but I'm going to get along with him, and I'm going to get up off the floor and learn how to take what life throws at me in a better way than I have been doing lately. Life's too short for dwelling on misery. I mean, I've gone through entirely worse times and made it through.     "Wake Your Mind Up" by 311   Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your time's up Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listen  Well I guess that's life When you see a dark road up the way And I guess that's life When you gotta roll through anyway Now don't scream, don't fight Fear never ever made it go away Same ghost town as yesterday Made you feel like love was miles away  Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your times up Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listen  Now those sleepless nights Thoughts just clouding up my brain Feeling helpless, repeating the same Old memories of pain and I wish it would rain, yo Give me starlit skies for dreamland I know it's really smaller than it seems but when The pressure gets under my skin I just wanna get out and scream in the wind, yo  The world we're living in is complicated The streets that we walk on are dark and jaded A wandering suld that's filled with hatred In it is poison, the youth is tainted Social engineering keeps us separated Media control is highly overrated Ignorance is bliss to those uneducated Listen to the message cause it's time we faced it  Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your times up Clock is ticking, your caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listen  I'm controller of my destination Gotta change my mind to help me break away The sun creeps over the hillside to shed this light No man could take away And I guess that's life You see a new side from the norm A new direction and meaning to the form And the calm in the eye of a storm, yo  Show me a desert that can never be drenched I'll show you a thirst that can never be quenched Temptation chronicles, the story of my life Been spent on a dose of balancing strife Inspiration, it comes and goes You can bet when it hits, I'm on the phone Singing to my voicemail trying to get it down In a sensation of shape shifting sound You're telling fables to cover up your foibles From overindulgence on things you find enjoyable Designed to take my mind away from the truth Try to make me out to play the sleuth They want you to think someone's watching you So they can make up a set of rules for you I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach Just trying to make some sense out from it, uh  Don't stop, don't stop what you got Don't stop til you find the sweet spot  (Awesome, awesome, awesome instrumental part)  Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your time's up Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listen

      Eghhh... I'm officially sick. I woke up feeling horrendously. I went to bed rather early, too, hoping that sleep would help me feel better, but it didn't exactly work much although I slept for about 11-12 hours.  I did a research on mucus and colds a little while ago and learned a lot.  I'm not sure how much I'll get done today since I don't feel very well at all, and that's bad since horror weeks 1 and 4/5 are coming up, and it doesn't even end there, for about a week later is All-State, and a week later is SAT, then I still need to set up some college visits for Spring Break... and then, of course, there're the two weeks I've been dreading the entire school year: the AP exams. I haven't started preparing for any of this (save for All-State, but only slightly), and I really don't need to be sick now. *Sigh* Believe it or not, though, some good has resulted out of my illness: I have to write a 1.5 page calculus problem (or some length to that extent, I think) for extra credit for Mrs. Dunn, and I've decided that mine will likely, in some amusing form, involve my cold and the exponential rate of growth of my dead white blood cells that cause my mucus to be coloured. Hehe.   Okay, enough for now, I suppose.   I guess I'll try to clean up a little bit and then try to get some schoolwork done.    "Return to Innocence" by Enigma    That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion  Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion  Don't be afraid to be weak Don't be too proud to be strong Just look into your heart my friend That will be the return to yourself The return to innocence  If you want, then start to laugh If you must, then start to cry Be yourself don't hide Just believe in destiny  Don't care what people say Just follow your own way Don't give up and use the chance To return to innocence  That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence  Don't care what people say Follow just your own way Follow just your own way Don't give up, don't give up To return, to return to innocence. If you want then laugh If you must then cry Be yourself don't hide Just believe in destiny.

      Snowless snow day yesterday. Wonderful!  No snow day today. =-(  Not so wonderful.   Today I got a new lab partner, but it's not a good thing, contrary to what I thought it would be. So, I no longer have to deal with Hope and all our arguments, but now I have to deal with Patrick. I normally like Patrick all right and he's pretty cool to talk to, but lately he's been a real jerk, and today was simply not good in chemistry. He argues with everything I say and extends everything to insufferable whining and drama. Normally, I could deal with that all right, but I am under lots of pressure lately, and my home is very full of drama lately, so I'm not sure how this will work out.   I'm definitely not looking forward to Patrick's next bad day; we seem to have bad days simultaneously, too, and if you know me, then you likely know that that will not be a good thing at all if I'm approached the wrong way.   Besides that, any fun that I might have gotten out of chemistry class is pretty much shattered. I cannot begin to describe just how much amusement I got from watching Michael and Jay's modes of strange communication and laughing at Jay. Really, now! All my entertainment's gone.  Well, at least I'm at Katherine's table now. And I no longer face the board... again. Meh.  Otherwise, my day wasn't particularly bad, other than the fact that I've been sneezing and sore-throated and runny-nosey all day. I've been sick pretty much all week, and it is not so cool. The next 1.5 weeks will not be very nice.    Well, on the bright side, tonight I'm home and kicking back for the most part. I'm about to have some really good hot cocoa, so that makes up for a not-so-terribly-awesome day, right?   "Smoke" by Natalie Imbruglia   My lullaby  Hung out to dry What's up with that It's over Where are you, dad Mom's looking sad What's up with that It's dark in here  Why bleeding is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I used to  My mouth is dry Forgot how to cry What's up with that You're hurting me I'm running fast Can't hide the past What's up with that You're pushing me  Why, bleeding is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I used to  Why, believing is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you crawling on the floor Why, bleeding is believing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you crawling to the door Why, bleeding is believing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you falling on the floor

      I woke up this morning, and the first thing I thought was, "Ummm, no." That reflected my day. Didn't get to make up the calculus quiz I needed to make up like I intended to do, and I'm not sure that I'll be able to get around to it very soon now. Things are coming to a semi-close, and I'm never practically ready (although spiritually, I always am).  'Nuff said about that.    On a different note, what is insanity? I can't really plug in a definition, what with the numerous relations that exist.  Sometimes I think I may have lost my sanity half my life ago. I was 8 years old, and something really weird happened-- I don't know what it was-- I didn't then, and I still don't know. One day, I just started crying and couldn't stop. There was a reason, but I couldn't explain it- not even to myself. And up to this day, I have no clue what happened. I was terrified and insecure and saddened and anguished and ashamed about it. The day I burst out into tears in church with a group of concerned people futilely attempting to consolate me was the day my mother said it had to stop. I didn't mean to cry; and yet I couldn't stop.   This continued for an extended period of time, and I was on the verge of seeing a psychologist when it stopped. Again, I don't know how nor why it stopped. It just did.   Maybe my subconscious regret for causing so much trouble made it stop. That's my best theory up until now, although I have none to explain its commencement.    And then everything was different. I don't know how nor why, but it was.    I don't know whether anyone shares such a strange episode with me, but I think that's when the general concept of rational thought process I had left me.  It amazes me how much fear people have of their own minds. I'm faulty of it, too, sometimes, until I return to my original stand that the mind is a gift and must be accepted as is, no matter how wacky it may seem. I actually like to appreciate that wackiness in other people, for they're those who aren't afraid of thinking. In essence, it's really not so scary, and it's okay to diverge from the flow.   At one point in my life-- namely, roughly two years ago- there was light, and although things were still never the same, they were better this time. I've drifted so far away from it, and I'm waiting on something to fall out of the sky for me. Literally. And I actually think that it'll happen.    So, if you think I'm a little out of it, don't penalize me for it. I don't mean badly, and it's not so bad. Really.    "With Every Light" by Smashing Pumpkins   Taking over  We're taking over  Throw the weight up off you shoulders now  That we can show our love  It's almost over it's almost over  No more war and no more soldiers  To stand against His love  Away with all the troubles that you've made  Away with waiting for another day  Away  Look ma the sun is shining on me  Impatient, in love and aching to be  Could you believe in heaven  If heaven was all you had  We're taking over we're taking over  Throw away your four leafed clovers  And stand beside this love  Away with everything you've grown to hate  Away with anything that holds you safe  Away  And every light I've found  Is every light that's shining down on me  I'm never alone  Look ma the sun is shining on me  Taking my time to do as I please  Could you believe in heaven  If heaven was all you had  The sun is beaming, radiating  All the love we are creating  We are creating  And every light I've found  Is every light that's shining down on me  I'm never alone

      Yesterday was exciting. It was the set day for the Futures program, an event at Georgia Tech for prospective female students which lasted all day, and I've determined that I am definitely applying. I absolutely LOVED Tech... If I don't go into music and therefore wind up within a mathematically involved field, I want to go there-- granted that I get in, that is. It's as though it were made for me; I realize that if I do wind up attending there, it will be a very rigorous scholastic experience that will allow me to have nearly no life, but it really seems like an awesome school (even after all the horror stories that some people from there have recounted).  I met a really cool girl from Texas who hung out with us throughout the day, and there was a really large amount of people from all over the country.  During the initial information session, a helium balloon set off a fire alarm, and we halfway evacuated until they realized that the culprit of setting it off was but a balloon. That was fairly amusing. My favourite speaker was a lady who was an Aerospace Engineer; she was very cool and very encouraging as well as foreign although, if she hadn't mentioned it, I would have never guessed her to be foreign. On the other hand, when we split up into groups by major, I was very confused. The program folks said that, were we to be interested in more than one major, we could divide our time into different sessions and simply move around. I wanted to go to both Engineering and Sciences, and, because Engineering was in a different building, I went there first. So, about halfway through Engineering, I left for Sciences, but, for some odd reason, Sciences ended half an hour earlier than it was supposed to, causing me to only catch the last ten minutes and then return to Engineering. The Engineering folks were cool, although the first speaker was obviously a hispanic woman with a nearly incomprehensible, strong accent- hence, I only caught about half of what she was saying. There was also a very nice professor, but she spoke entirely too softly, and from the rear end of the room, I could not hear a thing she was saying, which was a shame.  The only part I disliked about it was the President's Scholarship section of the day; two female representatives who had priorly received the scholarship spoke, and they were stupid, obnoxious, and entirely incompetent as far answering a question effectively goes although they were overly skilled at giggling incessantly for no reason. Ugh. I sincerely wanted to take my awesome Tech cup and throw it at one of them, hoping that the other would be stupid enough to run toward it and get hit, too.  The tour was pretty fun; although it wasn't as specific as I'd hoped (though I didn't expect anything incredibly specific in so little time) and I didn't get to sit in through any lectures, I saw "the beach" (hehe) and the horrible part of campus involving fraternities and sororities... *shivers* I really detested that part of the tour. Honestly, I didn't quite realize how many morons somehow managed to get into Tech. All the same, I'm a bit concerned about admission, but that's not something to worry about for a little while longer-- I've got other things to be thinking about right this very now.  It was funny to see some frightened expressions on students' faces, though. It seemed as though they had never seen that many females at once. At one point during break, I looked up and saw this dude gaping at me, and that was kind of weird. I think the tour guide, a sophomore engineer, was checking me out, but at least he was cute. That did make me a bit uncomfortable, so I just looked at the buildings, which was the purpose of the tour anyway.    All in all, I liked Tech a lot and felt as though it could be the right educational place for me (save for the frightening female:male ratio and the community restrooms).   Afterwards, I went to Lyndsey's, and her dad taught me how to shoot a rifle and a pistol. Wow-- pistols are really hard to shoot, and they bounce back entirely too much, but the rifle was pure fun. I was doing great, too. The very first shot I took, I hit the target (a can), which is something I'm very proud of. Right in the letter "o" of it, too! And at one point, I had about 10 or 11 consecutive successful shots... I like shooting entirely too much, hehe. I want to do it again. ( Not  on anything living, worry not!!!)   ^.^   Well, there's a lot to do today, involving mounds of makeup work for missing school yesterday (though it was totally worth it), so I'd better get started, or something of the like, anyway. Toodles!   "Neither Heaven nor Space" by Badly Drawn Boy   So quiet  It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high And the ring around the moon Looks like light and love Neither of which I get enough of Down there Where alot of people lie in a deep sleep  And months on end go by, in a single week  Down there  But much too slow  Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole? The air is running out, we're sinking much too low And if you sit long enough You can hear ghost trains As if the city speed Is just in our brains And coaxes close as we get to sugar cane Down there  But much too slow Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole? The air is running out we're sinking much too low So quiet So quiet It's neither heaven nor space It's just high And the ring around the moon Looks like light and love Neither of which I get enough of Neither of which I get enough of

      Hmmm... what a day! It actually started out all right, but then I became very depressed as I realized that I am an utter chemical imbecile although it's all right. History was annoying, and in Calculus I took a quiz feeling like poo and continued feeling that way until choir came about. Choir was really good, for a change. We broke into many small groups, and my group was cool. Of course, we did have the best sight readers of the class, but what really fueled it was the fact that everyone in the group actually  wanted  to make music. The group included me, Kim, Misha, Crisha, and Megan (or, the entire audible Alto section), Patrick, Neris, Cassius (who seemed grumpy as usual, though he was the only one, really), Erin, Jessica, and some other sophomores whose names I didn't know, but it was fun. We worked really well together and got a lot done, though we felt as though we'd failed as we slipped out of tune for a measure or two according to B when sight reading some lines for her the first time through. But we got over it.   The good block lifted me up a significant bit, considering that I was really down. Although it may seem that I'm always unhappy, I'm really not. Yesterday was pretty good; excepting an initial overly disastrous incident which happened first thing in the morning that I'd rather not get into recounting right now, some good things happened. We had a good, productive rehearsal in choir, and I got my Honor Choir CD. The recording could have been better, but it could have been worse, too. I also realize that it  is  a recording and is therefore bound not to sound as good as the actual live performance. ^.^ I liked Honor Choir this year.    I found out that I can "ooo" my way through my entire All State audition, which is something I'm very prone to doing (save for a few fragments here and there on which I  need  words to sing it correctly).    Besides all this, I'm one confused camper (imagine that!) more than ever now. I have no clue what I'm doing... I hope I figure things out before I make an even greater mess...  On a side yet more important note, 5-0=4, as I claimed on my last AP Quackulus test... Just as long as CPP doesn't find out and kick me off the math team, I will be all right *giggles*.   All right, well, I'd better get to homework! Laters gaters!    I am exceedingly obsessed with this song:    "Innocence Again" by Switchfoot   Do you remember when You were way back then You held the world inside your hands When you told me love Was the strongest stuff Your strength was innocence  But, oh man The signs of the times are omens You're starting the day in No man's land again   Who are you gonna be? When you're on your knees, who do you believe?  Fear is a lonely man You've been given innocence You've been given innocence again  You should know by now That your darkest hour Is when your broken heart goes down It's a bitter end When the sweet begins Grace is sufficiency  But, oh dear, we'll never deserve it No dear, we never could earn it Now, here the choice is yours  Grace is high and low We'll never be the same  oh, oh, oh... You've been given innocence, innocence, innocence. Who are you gonna be... You've been given innocence.

      Organized society. It's innerving. I realize that I, too, formerly took part in things that fall under this category, but I no longer stand it. I suppose that what truly angers me is the fact that everyone seems to deceivingly put up a show of happy-go-roundness at all times. It's not real. Why hide what's there? I don't understand.  Of course, I have had my negative experiences with it to make me despise it, too, but then I somehow learned that I shouldn't attempt to comform to set standards simply to appease hypocritical views anyway. If they can't understand, it doesn't matter. They likely weren't meant to anyway, at that point.    Closed mindedness. I'm very likely faulty of this myself, but I have no tolerance for deliberately conscious closed mindedness. What's with the box, dude?   Disrespect for one's own mind.  So, one really admires something but denies it so as to agree with someone else in order to please them. And that? A no-no. Sincerely. Respect for one's own mind... ever heard of that?    Mah, I'm living up to the Darian aspect of myself, criticizing society down to the marrow and just wanting to complain about everyone and everything. But it's my blog, and it's a free country, so I can do this and go unharmed!!   Imagine that.   I'm just ranting as though I were a rampaging old hag, just smashing words down inconsequently and hoping that no one will ever bring this entry up to me, for that might not be a good idea.   Just GAH. GAH. GAH. GAH.         I hate this town, I hate this state, I hate this country, I hate this continent, and, quite frankly, I hate this planet! And maybe even this galaxy, too!!!    "Megalomaniac" by Incubus   I hear you on the radio You permeate my screen Its' unkind, but if I met you in a scissor fight I'd cut off both your wings on principle alone On principle alone  Hey, megalomaniac You're no Jesus Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis Special,  As you know yourself Maniac Step down Step down  If I were your appendages I'd hold open your eyes So you would see That all of us are heaven sent There was never meant to be only one To be only one  Hey, megalomaniac You're no Jesus Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis Special,  As you know yourself Maniac Step down Step down  Yeah You're no Jesus You're no Elvis  You're no answer  Hey, megalomaniac You're no Jesus Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis Wash Your hands clean (of yourself) Maniac Step down Step down

      I'm kind of worried. The All State music is absolutely marvelous but difficult as crap.   The repertoire (mainly for Hinkle, as I said I'd post it): "Clap Yo' Hands" (Gershwin) "The World is Full of Poetry" (Brunner) "Three Ways to Vacuum Your House, Segment II" (Hatsfield) "Wade in the Water" (Althouse, I think) "Amazing Grace" (Can't think of arranger) "Salve Regina" (er, composer again...) "Go Where I Send Thee" (agh, composer!!!)   My favourite is "The World is Full of Poetry". It is also the one I sound most awful on. It is absolutely beautiful, but the range is insane for we Alto I's. We're on a key of B, and they expect us to go up to a high E! I can hit it, mind you, but it doesn't sound pretty-- what sounds worse are the descending eighth notes right after the E... oi.   I have a semi-solution to the problem. The song is in English, but if I don't sing the English and substitute "aaaah"s for higher notes and "ooo"s for the lower, I can sound pretty nice, sort of. I know that, for the audition, we're not required to sing the foreing language songs on words, but I don't know about English. From what I understand, they're going to score the actual music and not diction and such, but I don't know whether they expect me to sing in English. When I sing the English, I sound atrocious. I really hope I can "ooo" my way through it... I'll have to talk to Ms. B. about that.   "Three Ways to Vacuum Your House" is THE stuff. It is so incredibly cool, likely one of the most awesome choral songs I've ever worked on. It's super fun, and with work, I think I'll get that one all right. I have a lot of work left to do on the music, and I've only got a month. On that note, I should work on it a bit tonight.    I don't think there's a chance of my passing the AP Chemistry final examination. I'm still going to try it, for I suffered entirely too much for a year not to, but I am not sure I'll even pass it. There's just so much that I cannot remember that I need to remember.    SAT is coming my way entirely too quickly. There's something else that I need to prepare for... I'm worried about that, too. The stupid College Board (Satan)... how I despise them. This could make me or break me... moo...    However, there is a bright side to everything!!! First of all, we're on a five-day weekend, which should help me get some rest and things I need to get done done, and secondly, we're adopting a homeless kitten!!!  Her owner couldn't keep her, so she is currently at a pet shelter. She will be here tomorrow evening. Her name is Asia, and she's only a few months old. That's about all I know, but I'm still so excited. I really hope that Shah will accept her; I think he will. This is going to be great. Shah and Asia. He's going to have another kitty to collogue with. I hope that will serve to un-depress him a bit, since he still seems really down. Of course, we're going to have to be careful and be sure that there isn't a total shift of attention toward the kitten-- as long as attention is balanced, everything will be fine.  I just sincerely hope that we're not embarking on a new era of couch-peeing. We already went through that with Shah once, and that was enough, hehe.    Well, I have a pile of junk to get done, so I'd better get crackin'.  To all, to all, a fair, good... evening!!    "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega   I am sitting In the morning At the diner On the corner  I am waiting At the counter For the man To pour the coffee  And he fills it Only halfway And before I even argue  He is looking Out the window At somebody Coming in  "It is always Nice to see you" Says the man Behind the counter  To the woman Who has come in She is shaking Her umbrella  And I look The other way As they are kissing Their hellos  I'm pretending Not to see them Instead I pour the milk  I open Up the paper There's a story Of an actor  Who had died While he was drinking It was no one I had heard of  And I'm turning To the horoscope And looking For the funnies  When I'm feeling Someone watching me And so I raise my head  There's a woman On the outside Looking inside Does she see me?  No she does not Really see me Cause she sees Her own reflection  And I'm trying Not to notice That she's hitching Up her skirt  And while she's Straightening her stockings Her hair Is getting wet  Oh, this rain It will continue Through the morning As I'm listening  To the bells Of the cathedral I am thinking Of your voice...  And of the midnight picnic Once upon a time Before the rain began...  I finish up my coffee It's time to catch the train

      The braces are off.  I parted with them Monday afternoon between 2.00 and 3.00 pm. It was a fairly painful process but well worth it-- I don't miss them.   Today's been a completely uncanny day.   Went to visit my "friend" Dr. Morris first thing in the morning, an episode that resulted in his taking the freedom to prove me an utter historical imbecile. Of course, the fact that I simply passed out on my homework last night as opposed to studying the material that I was to be tested over in history today didn't help- hence, I really didn't know anything.  (So much for a "wake-up call" to help me stop procrastinating as badly as I've been doing lately.)  I am so going to bring him some advanced sight reading next week when I see him again. We'll see whether he really does know "everything."        I suppose the partial pleasant diversion that I acquired from that visit was talking to Jay, who was also liquidating supposed chemistry class time at the office. Collogued about Chemistry, of course, but it was great to see the humorous expression on a younger kid's face as soon as Jay left- he was looking as though he were trying to comprehend a different language- and, really and truly, it is.    Talked about death and calculus applications in relation to it in calculus. Fun stuff.  Mrs. Dunn thinks I'll do exceedingly well on my AP Calc final examination. But no pressure.    Today, choir was very depressing.  First of all, the song we worked on for the majority of the period was very grievious and disconsolate. It pertained to false love and the way young love can be unbelievably exciting, but as it grows older, it often fades away. Yeah.  Secondly, B really ruffled. I don't blame her; we don't have a very good choir at all this term, particularly as far as willingness to achieve anything meaningful together goes. The guys are awful; they're mostly sophomores, so that, I suppose, kind of serves to explain the problem, and some are just insanely obnoxious cases, although some of the seniors, who could set a good example, simply join in the immaturity. It's pretty bad.    B was extremely serious, and I don't think I've ever seen her reach that degree of anger in my 3 years of acquaintance with her. I actually pitied her.  By the time the end of class rolled around, I felt really odd as it was, what with the morbid day and the appalling piece.  In the last five minutes of class, we sang "May You Always Have a Song". As B played the introduction, she asked us to really think about what the piece was communicating. She played the music really well, too, and as B can't ever play piano parts well, I was impressed and realized that she had priorly been working on it.  Anyway, we started singing, and at one point I could hardly release any sound from how very moved I was. It really is an intense composition, and I was forced to battle the tears. So call me a crybaby.   It really reminded me of what music is all about, and B helped reinforce the concept afterwards while utter stillness settled.   She's a very talented woman, and she really cannot help the attitude of the group she has to work with. I can see why she gets so bitter and frustrated. Sadness struck as she vocalized the way she felt about music with a tone of disappointment after we finished "May You Always Have a Song". She said, "It brings everyone together, and we learn to live together... through music. And it's wonderful. That is what I wanted when I chose this path..."  I could relate to everything she'd said, including that disappointment. While singing the song, I realized that lately, I don't "always have a song", and I'm not always "filled with love", and the sun doesn't always "shine above". And while I want music to "be a part of the joy within my heart", it can't be because all sorts of crap-the craziness of things and the rushed pace at which everything moves, the pressure, the pain, solitude and its coolness- seem to stand in the way and never get out of it, lately.    On the bright side, walking outside for a minute almost stopped my breath because of the natural beauty surrounding me. I was reminded of God and of how I can't walk this walk alone.    I'm just tired.     I think I'll take a nap and get to work, as I have a lot to do and can't afford to ever fall asleep on my homework again.      "Stop Whispering" by Radiohead   And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do  Stop whispering, start shouting Stop whispering, start shouting  And my mother said let me spit on you son some more And the building said let me spit on your face some more And the feeling is that there's something wrong Because I can't find the words and I can't find the song  Stop whispering, start shouting Stop whispering, start shouting  Dear Sir, I have a complaint Can't remember what it is  It doesn't matter anyway It doesn't matter anyway

      After 10 years, a lot of things change. Her voice- her voice, you hear the difference. Why, ten years ago she was hypothetically the best ever; ten years ago I didn't know a word nor thing she was saying. Then she matured, while I grew. Still wonderful, and it's intriguing and blissful to run through it chronologically-and for the parallel rapport: to run through me chronologically. They were just words, just interesting words. They haven't changed. But I have. And my favourite stage is the intermediate. Why? I don't really know. The initial stage was just as intense though rather infantile. The latest stages were inspirational and resolved. Does this mean she's done? Perhaps publicly. Lord, I hope not. I get too much of a kick out of it. Too many relational possibilities on my end anyway.   6 years old- 20 years old.  16 years old- 30 years old-- do you realize guys she was born in 1974?  Wow. How the heck did  that  happen?   26- where will I be? What about  her ?  36- somewhere at least decently resolute. Will my handwriting keep getting progressively worse? How about hers? But I never saw her handwriting.  46- Let's call it satiation.  56- menopause?  Please  spare me? 66- that's half a century from the here and now, folks. 76- what an interesting number. Perhaps a grandmother.  By 86 I'll have spoken so much that my vocal chords will be fried. 96- I'll still jump around, maybe. At concerts. 106, I'll-- well, wait, I may not make it to 106; I drink far too much coffee for that. But at least it's not mary jane.   Mmmmmm... 2.49-am-rants. Slurp- too tasty.   All right. Onto chemistry- or bed?                               I think Shah was very glad to receive titanic amounts of attention (but he need not know).   --- But if there's one things that hasn't changed...                                  it's the  F  in my signature.       Oh, but I can't just give it all away!      My favourite.     " " by    Burn the books  They've got too many names and psychoses All this incriminating evidence  Would surely haunt me if someone broke into my house Suits in the living room Do you realize guys I was born in 1974 We've got someone here to  Explain your publishing We know how much you love to be in front of audiences  Hopeful you are Schoolbound you are Naive you are Driven you are  Take a trip to New York  With your guardian and your Fake identification When they said, "Is there something, Anything you'd like to know, young lady?"

      I think I can officially say that I wish I could not exist now.   Of course, a 35-minute cry-and-gripe-and-whine to yourself session is always yay so as to prevent other people's feeling sorry for you.   But I feel a little better, because mom totally rocks-- she bought me coffee creamer and lots and lots of those yogurt smoothies before leaving for Italy (she's leaving tomorrow evening).  Oh, and my grandmother's actual physical elsewhereness totally makes things better.  *Sigh* I need to go get ready for a stupid performance.    "Sweet Song"  by Blur  What am I to do Someone here is really not happy Put myself on a line It seems I never got through to you So I wean myself off slowly  I'm a darkened soul My streets all pop music and gold All our lives are on TV You switch off and try to sleep People get so lonely  I believe I believe I believe Everything's out to sea I believe I believe I believe I believe That is the way it should be I hope you feel the same  Everyone is dying Stop crying now here comes the sun I didn't mean to hurt you no no no It takes time to see what you have done So I wean myself off slowly  I believe I believe I believe Love is the only one I deceive I deceive I deceive I deceive 'Cause I'm not that strong  Hope you feel the same  And now it seems that we're falling apart But I hope I see the good in you Come back again I just believed in you

      Uhhh... uh.  I found something that totally kicks Starbucks's Frappuccinos' butts: just go to Smoothie Planet and get a coffee and chocolate smoothie (something Goat... Frozen Goat, maybe? I do believe that the name is something along those lines) and you will know what I'm talking about. Additionally, the smoothies have this empowering stuff that really gives an energy burst. I had even more trouble than usual sitting still at rehearsal yesterday. The main point I'm trying to convey here is that THOSE THINGS ARE SO GOOD!!!  SAT this morning... *shakes head*  Definitely retesting. Need I say more? I didn't think so, either.    Uhm. Yeah. Too much rehearsal everywhere lately *shoots self*.       I greatly thank all ye folks who are always there for me and prevent my chasing of school buses, my perdition in high school parking lots (which can be quite distressing), and my drowning in mere glasses of water. I love you!    Honorary quote: "Si! Si! Feo gato!! Gato feo! Si!!" --Philip, referring to the newly created aluminum foil turtle.    This song has totally described my life for the past few weeks/months/years: (I'm a Cancer, but both my sister's and mine work for me-- Ale's a Taurus)   "Your Horoscope for Today"  by Weird Al    Aquarius There's travel in your future when your tongue freezes to the back of a speeding bus Fill that void in your life by playing Whack-A-Mole seventeen hours a day  Pisces Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos with the Ebola virus You are the true Lord of the Dance, no matter what those idiots at work say  Aries The look on your face will be priceless when you find that forty pound watermelon in your colon Trade toothbrushes with an albino dwarf, then give a hickey to Meryl Streep  Taurus You will never find true happiness - what you gonna do, cry about it?

      Okay, so I missed a song yesterday. Here's one for today:   "Math Sucks" by Jimmy Buffett  If necessity is the mother of invention Then I'd like to kill the guy who invented this The numbers come together in some kind of third dimension A regular algebraic bliss Let's start with something simple Like one and one ain't three And two plus two will never get you five There's fractions in my subtraction And X don't equal Y But my homework is bound to multiply  Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) I'd like to burn this textbook, I hate this stuff so much Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks)  Sometimes I think that I don't know that much-- math sucks!  I got so bored with my homework I turned on the T.V. The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth They asked the new Miss America "Hey babe, can you add up all those bucks?" She looked puzzled then just said, "Math Sucks!"  Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) You don't even have to spell it, all you have to do is yell it Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) Sometimes I think that I don't know that much--but math sucks!  Geometry, trigonometry, and if that don't tax your brain There are numbers too big to be named (too big to be named) Numerical precision is a science with a mission And I think it's gonna drive me insane  Parents fighting with their children and the Congress can't agree, Teachers and their students are all jousting constantly Management and labor keep rattling old sabers, Quacking like those Peabody ducks  Math sucks (quack quack) Math sucks (quack quack) You don't even have to spell it, all you have to do is yell it! Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) Sometimes I think that I don't know that much--But math sucks!  Math sucks, math sucks, math sucks the big one Math sucks, math sucks, math sucks the big one    And yes, that does, indeed, reflect my current mood.

      Auditions Saturday went pretty well, and I even got a free coffee out of my mom for being a "good, hardworking kid" [insert twisted expression of disbelief and confusion here].  Today was mostly awesomenessitissity simply because I received my all state score: I made a 100 (on a percent system, indeed!)!!! I was so ecstatic, and still am pretty darn satisfied. Joel and I were the two 100's from our school. Wee!!! ^.^    Otherwise, I'm downright exhausted. I hardly have any time to live these days, and it's rather frustrating. SAT this Saturday= poop= do miserably= retake in June, definitely. Yeah. Okay. I'm about to zonk out, though, so I guess I should call it shower time and then crash indefinitely time (well, hopefully I'll scoowample to climb out of bed by 7.15-ish?)  And on that note, zzz...   *No lyrics today because I'm literally about to pass out... literally.*

      Wow. It's been a horrible week, and it's scoowampled to extract an extravagant amount of energy from me.   I slept very little this week, and no one's left me alone for a freaking second when I needed to be alone (save for the Chemsitry all-nighter I pulled). I suppose I could sum things up a bit.  a) The County Honor Choir rather sucks. I don't really like the music too much, and we don't seem to have too many great participants. Eh.   b) Took ChemOlympiad test today. Likely bombed it.   The food was good, though! =-D  c) Asia is pissing me off. A lot. She's very mean still, and she's tearing up the house and attacking Shah. I don't know what to do.   d) All State is tomorrow. I'm scared. My audition is at 10.50 am. Moo...  e) I feel like crap, and I'm tired. Life seems so empty and lonely lately, and I'm hating it.  f) Side, non related note: over time this semester (or maybe this year, in general), I have learned to appreciate some people that I was previously very closed-minded about. I feel like a real jerk for thinking so badly of them now that I have made up my mind that they aren't such bad/snooty/detestable people after all.    All right, there was my update. Sorry for no more and no happier, but I suppose that such things happen.   Adios, amigos/amigas.   "Let that Be Enough"  by Switchfoot   I wish I had what I needed  To be on my own  'Cause I feel so defeated  And I'm feeling alone   And it all seems so helpless  And I have no plans  I'm a plane in the sunset  With nowhere to land   And all I see  It could never make me happy  And all my sand castles  Spend their time collapsing   Let me know that You hear me  Let me know Your touch  Let me know that You love me  Let that be enough   It's my birthday tomorrow No one here could know  I was born this Thursday  22 years ago   And I feel stuck  Watching history repeating  Yeah, who am I?  Just a kid who knows he's needy   Let me know that You hear me  Let me know Your touch  Let me know that You love me  And let that be enough

      So yeah, it's a Meanie Monday all right.   I woke up and Asia had vomited all over my shower. She eats so much that she can't take down what she eats; consequently, the food takes a joy ride back up and out of her throat and onto my stuff-- namely, my shower and other various types of floors.  I was going to be on time for rehearsal this time, but given that I had to clean and disinfect the bathtub before I could take a shower in it, that didn't happen.  When I walked in, B wanted an explanation for my tardiness. When I explained that, if she really wanted to know, Asia had vomited everywhere, she didn't seem to believe me.   Honestly-- I always have valid unbelievable excuses. I really don't make any of them up, but they're all so strange that I'm pretty sure that she never believes me and simply always thinks I overslept. *Sigh*  The day dragged on all right, I suppose, until a minor meeting with a sordid, lanky senior shrew witch whose name I don't even know but who seems to hate me for no apparent reason, as every time I run into her, she's very mean to me. Maybe because I'm white. Maybe because I'm white and foreign (she's African American). What's up with the supposedly dissolved grudges still lingering? I mean, really. Some people just need to grow up. It isn't my fault that whites used to treat blacks like crap-- much less is it my fault since my ancestors  weren't even here.            Grr.  A seemingly depressed mood has fallen over the house today-- mostly because of my grandmother. I really do think she is ill, this time, though. She doesn't appear fine at all, and she's not. Besides, my getting the "you know I don't really hate you and I'm actually really proud of you" speech from her, an intonation that I've never experienced with my grandmother before, scares me. I'm pretty scared, indeed. I think she's really going this time, and I know it will be hard on my mom. Heck, though I never thought it'd be that hard on me, it'll be hard on me, too. But she's still here now.    I have to do piles of work tonight-- roughly 3/4 of the chemistry problems plus the homework for tonight, all because of that stupid honor choir rehearsal tomorrow. I sort of wish I hadn't committed now.    God loves me, on the other hand. I had discovered that B accidentally told me to learn Alto I for All State when it turns out that I was really assigned to Alto Ia (which is totally different), and I talked to B about it today. She said that I should be able to simply tell the judges of her mistake as well as how the part is more in my range anyway, and they shouldn't mind. What a relief-- I was about to worry there.   Okay, well, I think it's time for a conclusion. I think I've decided that I'm going to try to scoowample to remember to post an honorary quote or two daily, for some of the stuff that people tell me is simply too hilarious, and I wind up writing it down most of the time anyway. And the winners are...   "Life is a sad, sad place." --Ryan (in History, expressing his feelings in an inadvertently non coherent fashion)  "Tears, Francesca, tears! Salty, tear-shaped tears!" --Kayla (if you really want to know, you ask her. I'm not even going to bother.)   I'm so hungry. Mmmm... coffee...   "Coffee and TV" by Blur   Do you feel like a chain store Practically floored One of many zeros Kicked around bored  Your ears are full but you're empty Holding out your heart To people who never really Care who you are   So give me coffee and tv easily I've seen so much, I'm going blind and braindead virtually Social ability is hard enough for me Take me away from this big bad world and agree to marry me So we can start over again  Do you go to the country It isn't very far There's people there who will hurt you 'Cause of who you are  Your ears are full of their language there's wisdom there you're sure Till the words start slurring And you can't find the door   So give me coffee and tv easily I've seen so much, I'm going blind and braindead virtually Social ability is hard enough for me Take me away from this big bad world and agree to marry me So we can start over again  So we can start over again   P.S.: Regardless of whether you know or know her not, please keep my friend Heather in your thoughts/prayers. Her husband is in the army and will soon be sent off to Iraq. This is particularly hard for her because they have only been wed since November 2003. Thanks.

      a) Very nice to be out of school, was about dead-- party... *shakes head*  b) Asia peed on the large Iranian carpet. Yes- an original Iranian carpet... yes, I have to clean it... grr... but let me get to the point:  c) MUSIC MIDTOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!  This one's "oh-my-gawd"-worthy!  The selections this year are awesome. I want to go. Pretty badly.  Offspring, Foo Fighters, Switchfoot, and Damien Rice are the main reasons. Other good bands, too: Smile Empty Soul, Trapt, Story of the Year, Puddle of Mud ( though I don't care too incredibly much for them), Fuel (same as previous), Default, and this band that I don't know whose name I like, George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic. *Is about to download stuff and find out who it is*  But yeah, here's the whole lineup:  http://www.musicmidtown.com/schedule/index.cfm   W00t!!!   "You" by Switchfoot   There's always something in the way There's always something getting through But it's not me It's You  It's You  Sometimes ignorance rings true But hope is not in what i know It's not in me..me It's in You, it's in You  It's all i know It's all i know It's all i know  I find peace when I'm confused I find hope when I'm let down Not in me ... me In You It's in You  I hope to lose myself for good I hope to find it in the end Not in me ... me In You  It's all i know It's all i know It's all i know  In You In You It's in You It's in You  There's always something in the way There's always something getting through But it's not me It's You It's You It's You ....   I wish I could still totally relate to the lyrics...

      Whoa... Asia just jumped in my lap for the first time ever. She's purring, and she seems to think me a very comfortable cushion, too...  Good gosh, have I gained THAT much weight??  Ew!! She, too, drools!! Great. Now I have 2 drooly cats. Wondrous!  And her fur is black. So, now I'm totally covered as an eskimo-- grey hair for my black pants, black hair for my khakis (which I just happen to be wearing now)!!!!   Moo, I want to sleep but I have to go to a party... =-(          "I'm Only Sleeping" by the Beatles   When I wake up early in the morning Lift my head, I'm still yawning When I'm in the middle of a dream Stay in bed, float upstream (float upstream)  Please don't wake me No don't shake me Leave me where I am I'm only sleeping  Everybody seems to think I'm lazy I don't mind, I think they're crazy Running everywhere at such a speed Till they find there's no need (there's no need)  Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away And after all I'm only sleeping  Keeping an eye on the world going by my window Taking my time  Lying here and staring at the ceiling Waiting for a sleepy feeling   Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away And after all I'm only sleeping  Keeping an eye on the world going by my window Taking my time  When I wake up early in the morning Lift my head, I'm still yawning When I'm in the middle of a dream Stay in bed, float upstream  Please don't wake me No don't shake me Leave me where I am I'm only sleeping

        Quick update:    Asia's getting better. She's a lot nicer and stopped hissing (mostly-- she still hisses at Shah every now an then). She and Shah are still in the process of getting along.   Calculus exam today may have slightly kicked my butt. I wanted to kick myself after turning it in and realizing that I had made a very dumb integration mistake. Ugh.   Festival-- kinda sucked. Got in a huge fight with mom that day. Hasn't mentioned anything about it, thank God.  Went as class B (what the fry?) and made all 1's but a 2 in performance from one judge. While I thought we sounded like fishstix on the first piece and deserved a two there, the second piece was very nice. However, on the first piece, he gave us a two for the wrong reasons. All that we did well on, he said we did badly on, and vice-versa. Ehh... Most choirs' sopranos were uber-sharp. Good alto everywhere.   Kudos to NGHS's men. Nice performance. Oh, and I want someone to teach me that "Vive l'Amour/ Vive la Companie" song. It's been stuck in my head for a while, and it's awesome.    History exam tomorrow. Not going to make a high grade in the class for the quarter although it's supposedly my easiest. Worried about exam. Have yet to start studying. I hate history and having a crappy memory.   Forgot to ask B a tenth time for choir makeup work. Poo. Won't have a 100 in choir, and it's not even my fault. Rrr.   Did I mention that mom is indirectly evil these days?   Yeah.  Ok. Time to go study history, though I dun wanna.    Moo.   "Vive L'Amour" by somebody    Let every good fellow now join in our song, Vive la compagnie!  Success to each other, and pass it along, Vive la compagnie!  Chorus: Vive la, vive la, Vive l'amour. Vive la, vive la, Vive l'amour. Vive l'amour, vive l'amour, Vive la compagnie!!  A friend on your left, and a friend on your right, Vive la compagnie! In love and good fellowship, let us unite, Vive la compagnie!  Repeat chorus  Now wider and wider, our circle expands, Vive la compagnie!  We'll sing to our comrades, in far away lands Vive la compagnie!   Repeat chorus  With friends all around us, we'll sing out our song Vive la compagnie!  We'll banish our troubles, it won't take us long Vive la compagnie!   Repeat chorus  Should time or occassion, compel us to part Vive la compagnie!  These days shall forever, enliven our heart Vive la compagnie!   Repeat chorus    ---Although I'm pretty sure that NGHS's men sang a different arrangement.

      Once upon a time, there was a buffalo soldier with saliently long dreadlocks. He was driven from Africa to the heart of America, but little did he know that his dreadlocks carried the parainfluenza virus, a virus that serves to cause the common cold.   One day, while he was standing in line at his local coffee shop awaiting the preparation of the cafe mocha he'd long sought to buy and sip, one of his dreadlocks came in contact with a cup of coffee near him which was destined to belong to Joel, a successful businessman. Joel squealed at the sight, alarmed. The buffalo soldier apologetically said, "Don't worry, be happy, man!"  Joel growled skeptically, "Oh, well, I'll be late for work if I don't hurry, " and quickly gulped the cup of coffee.  Two days later, at the office, Joel started experiencing the symptoms of the cold. He sneezed vigorously and continuously, and when Matt, the fellow who worked in the office nextdoor, approached him with a pot of coffee, Joel was glad to receive him. The two commenced engaging in profound conversation when Matt exclaimed, "Oh! I forgot the sugar! I'll go get it. I shall return." Joel sneezed again, this time in the pot of coffee. He thought, "Don't worry, be happy, man!" and failed to mention the incident to Matt upon his return.   Matt poured himself a cupfull of the coffee, drank it, and marveled, "Boy, is this coffee great or what?!" His secretary Kimberly asked to try some, and Matt happily poured her a cup.   Soon enough, the vast majority of the 21st floor of the building had had coffee from the pot. There was a mutual appreciation for the coffee, and when Jay the psychic biochemist was told to have a mugfull, he felt an evil aura about the coffee. He obtained a sample of the coffee and analyzed it under a powerful microscope. After a few minutes, he remarked, "This coffee is loaded with dead white blood cells-- with snot carrying the common cold virus!!"  Panick-stricken, all who had drunk the coffee turned to Joel and, with clenched fists, gnarled, "Thou shall suffer!!!"   Joel initially had 6000 viral bacteria in him. Assume that 90% of the bacteria wound up in the coffee pot. Given that the bacteria grows exponentially from 2000 to 4000 units in 20 minutes, that the coffee party lasted 2 hours, that the individuals' immune systems were fairly weak, and that each person could only withstand an infection of 6000 bacteria before dying, how many people did Joel need to escape from in order to avoid being lynched and surviving?     Credits: Bob Marley and the common cold   And yes, I do claim a copyright on this. Don't steal my problem!! I have a mean cat to hurt you if you do!!!

      Asia is making me so mad that it's not even funny anymore. It's one thing to be terrified, but it's another to be a selfish snob.    First of all, she still hates Shah with all her might. He tries to stay away from her, and she follows him and starts hissing at him. Poor Shah. Then, she won't let him have anything that belongs to him. She has her own bowls for water and food, and she wouldn't let Shah get to his food, which was beside hers. So, I moved all of Shah's stuff to the other side of the kitchen-- I even gave her the nicer spot, by the window!!!- but noooooo, she wanted Shah's stuff, so she went back over to Shah's food, at which point I got mad because poor Shah was hungry. So, then, I fed them the EXACT SAME THING to make her happy. They are just like two furry children, for real. They ate quietly, Asia glaring at Shah from time to time and Shah returning the glares, and then they both proceeded to clean themselves at opposite ends of the living room, still glaring at one another.  Then, they started arguing again-- Asia commencing it, of course!   Besides the fact that she's stressing Shah out, I'm mad at her because she's a nosey mess.  Ale was painting today, and she went ON the palette-- STUPID cat-- full of paint-- I'm not even sure whether it was toxic!!-- and then walked EVERYWHERE with blule paint on her paws. It took me an hour to clean the trail of blue paint (she stained the ghettomachine), and when I tried to get the paint off her paws with cat wipes, she freaked out on me and tried to kill me. I chased her around for 30 solid minutes in attempt to clean her, and she hissed at me the entire time. So, then, I decided that if she wanted to keep licking her paws and die, that was her prob, and I left her alone.  Then, you can't imagine WHAT she did. She ate my homework!!!  Like, really! She went and bit a corner off my calculus homework that only took me, oh, say, an hour to do!!!?!!?!?! I was able to tape it back together, thank goodness, but still! And she scratched one of my BDB CD's.   I simply don't have patience nor time for this right now. The next few months will be hell, and she's already making it harder.  I'm really starting to think this wasn't a good idea. I'm going to let mom deal with the cat, because it was her idea, and anyway, mom's the only one who can approach her unharmed. I swear, I have only touched the cat ONE TIME. ONE TIME. In 48 hours. ONE TIME. She let me pet her ONE TIME, when mom was there. She's a little suck up with mom. She makes me so mad.   Honestly, I normally love cats, but this is the first cat to ever make me so angry and the first cat to ever hate me so much.   I'm afraid of wearing shorts around the house because she likes to attack my legs-- she hasn't scratched me yet, but she's come pretty darn close so many times.   Furthermore, I think she has fleas. Something's been biting me since she arrived. I can't even do anything about it, because I can't get closer than 3 feet to her, so I can't get the anti-flea on her.    I told mom that she should either a) take her to Petsmart and have her claws clipped off or b) buy me a leather glove (one of those that's used when training hawks), otherwise I'll never be able to get near this cat.   UGHH!!! I'm so frustrated, honestly. I so hope she gets used to it and quits being such a meanie. Back to calculus I go... and if she whines that loudly another time........................................................ *shakes fist*  }=-?   "Frustrate" by Flotsam and Jetsam  I want to kill, to throw against the wall  Hole in the glass to feel it all  A release to stay insane   I want to scream  Clenched fist, ground teeth  A bad dream, feeling so mean  Stumble across my piece  Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel  All of the sudden it feels so real  The bang, the smoke, the blood   Jump to the car, start it to the floor and while the engine's still in a roar slap it it drive  And leave behind a trail of anger a path to find   I want to scream  Clenched fist, ground teeth  A bad dream, feeling so mean  Stumble across my piece  Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel  All of the sudden it feels so real  The bang, the smoke, the blood   I can't feel my feet but I see em flyin  Never hit the ground, rising above  Looking down on you, down on the heads of the damned  Marching all right through into the crowd   I want to scream  Clenched fist, ground teeth  A bad dream, feeling so mean  Stumble across my piece  Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel  All of the sudden it feels so real  The bang, the smoke, the blood   I want to kill, to throw against the wall  Hole in the glass to feel it all  A release to stay insane

        Sector A: Mean Cats    Asia is terrified. And she doesn't like me.  Last night, mom went to pick up Asia. She brought her home, and while she was still in the cage, she saw Shah and started freaking out. She started hissing and growling and bouncing madly in attempt to kill him. Therefore, not knowing what to do about it, we put her in the art studio by the garage overnight. Shah was terrified and insisted on spending the night with me with the door closed. Poor baby.  So, then, this morning I woke up at about 11.30 when my mother called, asking me to deal with the issue. I locked Shah in my room and went downstairs to let Asia out. She was terrified and hissing at me more than ever. I was very scared, too. I called Emily and spoke to Ms. Kim and Em about it all. That was a bit comforting.   So, yeah, I spent the rest of my day pretty much trying to avoid the cat so as to keep my flesh, unable to get anything done out of fear I'd freak  her out even more.  She's a bit stupid, too. She managed to hurt herself quite a few times, and it was actually pretty funny. There is no accessing anything one needs without her fussing about it. I'm starting to be really irritated. I think she's bipolar; one moment, she's relaxed and observative and adorable-- the next, she's hissing her throat off. This being a crazy set of months that's approaching, it's a really bad time to have to deal with cat drama...    Sector B: Good Concerts    The Mercer concert tonight was very good. Northgate's men choir performed first, and they did pretty well. I liked the second piece they sang.  We did all right, but at one point during "Cantate Domino" poor Neris got really excited, I guess, and sang to prominence; Ms. B.'s mouthing to him that he had been entirely too loud throughout the entire piece seemed to put him in a disappointed/ ill mood. I think we went a little sharp on "O Waly Waly", but my mom didn't think so.   Ms. B. totally foot-in-the-mouthed herself. She was talking about two of her prior students who were currently in the Mercer choir and how proud of them she was, and at one point she said something like, "I really didn't want them to go to Mercer- sorry," and went on babbling. Initially, it seemed as though she were implying that Mercer weren't a good enough school, and later, it seemed as though she were implying that her two students weren't talented enough to go to Mercer... All in all, I was left with a big question mark in my head and never quite understood what on Earth she was attempting to convey. She probably should have never said any of it. Hehe.   B and I actually had a good, ten minute conversation before the concert. She sat beside me for a while, and we talked about choral music and the illegal processes I must go through to find the good stuff (downloading-- and I gave her some tips on searching, too-- is that bad?) as well as how odd it was that I'm almost a senior and almost graduating. That lead on to a college and career discussion; that was likely the most shocking part of the conversation. She said that she thought I could do everything I listed (you likely know the list by now, and it's kind of long and backwards as I'm that way), and she said she'd give me a list of good music schools and good people to contact. Besides all this, she thanked me for being on time. =.P   The Mercer Singers were awesome. They sang some really awesome stuff, and I knew most of it. I almost jumped off my seat over "Daemon Irrepit Collidus", which is a totally awesome, awesome, awesome, cool Latin intriguing piece. They also sang "Sing Me to Heaven", which was a pretty-- an uber-pretty. They sang other lotsa good stuff, and they closed with a hilarious Mercer arrangement of THAT song (I really cannot think of the title, but it's a traditional).   Good concert. I shouldn't have been so skeptical about it to begin with, but it was good, indeed. It was certainly a marvelous break from the cat drama.     Sector C : And Things like Confusion    B puzzles me. The cat befuddles me. My life confuses me beyond belief.   I'm kinda sleepy, but I likely need to at least clean my room, or something, as I promised mum I'd go watch  The Passion of the Christ   with her tomorrow. It surprises me that she wants to see it. I hope it will speak to her.   I hope it will speak to me, too, as I'm still in that Christian down that I've been in... for a long time now.      Furthermore, we had only instant coffee today. No coffee for me today. Had to have Chai instead. =-(                           And I think I've gained weight.    Maybe this should be "Gatton" instead:    "Cabron" by Red Hot Chili Peppers   Cabron cabron Cabron cabron I see you in the park You're always wearing  Dodger blue Mad doggin' me and  Anyone from any other crew I am small but I am strong I'll get it on with you If you want me to What else can I do Everyone would take a cue From anything you do If you want them to What else can they do  I don't want to fight  I want to get along with you This time of night's For singin' songs About the local news Cabron cabron Cabron cabron I'll come around and make peace  Get down have a barbecue  Let's keep the moon awake And do electric boogiloo I am small but I am strong  You see I'm just like you If you only knew That I'm just like you  All the world would Take a cue from Anything you do If you only knew That they're just like you  I don't want to fight I want to get along with you This time of night's For singin' songs About the local news Cabron  If you want me to What else can I do Cause i'm just like you  If you only knew Cabron

      You know, there's a creek called Wahoo Creek under the bridge on Macedonia Rd. (right by my house, in case you didn't know).   Today was awesomenessitissitely fun. The school day was an uneventful, dragging, and paradoxically lethargic nuisance, but at least lab was entertaining, even as Patrick and I argued jokingly (I think). We're getting along well, and I'm relieved. I was initially worried that we wouldn't get along because we are very much alike although the resemblance isn't easy to see immediately. Overall, though, I believe that there is a mutual liking of each other and each other's mind. We had a very good conversation about snot yesterday, as a matter of fact.   I'd like to thank both Kim and Mr. Coleman for the cookies. You can't begin to imagine how much better I felt after eating them (again, the Aleve wasn't too gentle on the stomach).   Anyway, I went to the Pottery room dopo scuola to wait on Lyndsey, who had to do some makeup work. Met a really cool girl, Leigh, and while we were talking and Lyndz was throwing on the wheel, I said, "Hey, I wanna do that!"  So I did.  To begin, I was doing pretty well. Eventually, Mr. Sizemore came into his room and helped me, too. He seems as though he were a really awesome teacher. He is one of the VERY few art teachers who believe in actual self-expression through art, and he is really nice, too. I would really like to take that class, but I don't have any room for it (not to mention that I am convinced that I would fail).   Eventually, I ruined the cool vase that I was creating, and I learned that one can't simply start over from a prior disaster. It is A LOT harder to do than it seems, this throwing on the wheel. I made a mess and soaked the throwing wheel area with clay water (which we then cleaned up well), and I had clay all over my jeans (still do), but it was so totally worth it and quite an exciting experience.  We left the school at approximately five o' clock, and we went to ATL Bread Co. to get  muchly deserved Cafe Mochas. It is really true that ATL Bread Co. Cafe Mochas make everything better, and the coffee was saliently good tonight. I had never seen the girl who made it before, but I doubt she was new. Perhaps, she may have simply worked when we weren't there (although that would be very little time to work, if it were so).   Had a good "no pressure over cafe mocha" (hehe) conversation about various stuff. 'Twas nice and muchly needed.  Went to Lyndz's. Talked to 'rents. Fun stuff. I love those people. Mr. Lee tried to show me how to thingy the bow, but my performance with it was very poor because I wasn't strong enough to pull it back. Lyndsey pulled my arm while he pulled the bow-- 'twas a tug-of-war between daughter and father, with my arm as a medium. Lyndsey pulled it spontaneously (without outside help, get it? Oh, stop giving my blog odd looks, Kim. We just finished the chapter, cut me some slack! =-P), but she is stronger than me. It was fun all the same.    We were on the verge of playing SC II when Kevin called about a fight that was supposed to happen. Lyndsey was, for some reason, excited about it, so I figured, "What the heck."  We went to the supposed there, and they decided on a different location, initiating a messy mission of follow-the-leader-in-your-car (which, by the way, is pretty interesting with the Noir song which plays during killing missions--"Canta per Me"), but then, they scoowampled to go elsewhere and eventually to a stupid high school party, a proliferation of plans we resolved not to catenate with them on. We returned to Lyndz's instead, and I'm very glad we did so. Kevin's a nice guy, but he seems like an idiot. Not a mentally challenged case, but simply an immature, fun-loving, idiotic high school kid. This isn't to say I dislike him (no sarcasm intended)!  When we arrived, her dad said, "I got some cans out in the yard for you."   I more than obviously grinned and took up the invitation to shoot without waiting to be asked twice. Lyndz and I shot a while. I think I'm getting better. ^.^          Only played with the rifle, though, and learned how to put it on safety.   Sat out on the cool swing on such a wonderful evening. Then, played some good, quality SC II. I've become sucky at it versus Lyndsey, but it's still fun. Then, came home.    I had a really good time and needed it, badly.   It's really good to be able to simply kick back and have fun, as I am still a kid and that's what I'm supposed to do. I'm glad it's good, (mostly) safe, clean fun although the idead of going out and impersonating an utter imbecile seems inspiring, from time to time. I'm really glad we didn't do that , though.   Asia should arrive tonight, finally. She's completely black with green eyes. I need to set up a kitty litter box for her.I'll do that in a bit.   I have a concert tomorrow at First United Methodist at 7 pm. If you have nothing better to do, feel free to come, but don't expect much-- the NHS choir sucks to insufferable extents this semester.  Ms. Bizarth got really frustrated today and walked out on our class. She said it was the most immature group she's ever had to work with, and I believe her. I do admit that I'm perennially whispering to Kim if I have a chance, but I try to respect B all the same. What it all boils down to is that the current sophomore class came in and totally screwed everything up. I remember when I was a freshman, the mixed choir was awesome. When I was a sophomore, it was a little less awesome, but we still kicked butt. Now, it's just trash. So, B gets bitter about it; I think I understand, actually. It's her life. Music is what she does. To see it all go down the drain because of a stupid little jerkoff who can't respect anyone and affects the rest of his section negatively (Grayson) would make me mad, too. So, she gets bitter and mean, and we, in turn, get bitter and mean (and start to detest Ms. B like I'm starting to do). There's a lot of hatin' going on in our choir, and that's a problem. One can't make music if he/she/it can't get along with the people he/she/it is making music with. Sure, it's possible, but it is nowhere near as majestic and rewarding an experience as it could be if there were harmony within the participants. There has to be a common love for music and feeling of relevance of the activity, or else it's trash. Right now, I feel as though I were totally wasting a class/credit, and that makes me mad. I wanted to be able to make music with good people daily with a good, sane conductor, but I'm not sure that'll ever happen again.  Oh, yeah, and I'm doing a County Honor Choir at some point soon. I think the performance is April 1 for the inauguration of the new Performing Arts Center, though I can't remember when rehearsals are and I don't have music yet. But I committed to it, and Kim's participating with me (w00t!).   I need to work on All-State music. That's coming up in 15 (14 tomorrow) days. Yikes! I may do that a bit tonight.   On a side note, I am mad at this: I have been trying to get 311 tickets for virtually 2 weeks now. While doing homework, I kept the phone right beside me when listening to 99X. I would so make up an excuse to take the History exam early if I could go to the 311 concert. But nooooooo! No 311 tickets for Fran no matter how hard she tries! Ughh!  All right, well, I leave you with a bow.  *Bows*   "No Pressure Over Cappuccino" by Alanis Morissette   And you're like a 90's Jesus And you revel in your psychosis  How dare you? And you sample concepts like hors d'euvres  And you eat their questions for dessert  Is it just me,or is it hot in here?   And you're like a 90's Kennedy And you're really a million years old  You cannot fool me They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots  And they'll stumble around like hypocrites  Is it just me or is it dark in here?   You may never be or have a husband You may never have or hold a child  You will learn to loose everything  We are temporary arrangements   And you're like a 90's Noah  And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things  And they wonder why you're frustrated  And they wonder why you're so angry  And is it just me or are you fed up?    And may God bless you in your travels  In your conquests and queries

      Everything's a little bit better now. Just a tad.    It's going to be one heck of a turmoil, this remainder of the semester.  But we'll make it through, somehow-- will do, will do!    "When the Rain Comes" by Third Day   When the rain comes It seems that everyone has gone away When the night falls You wonder if you shouldn't find some place To run and hide Escape the pain But hiding's such a lonely thing to do  I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again I can't stop the rain, but I will hold you 'till it goes away  When the rain comes You blame it on the things that you have done When the storm fades  You know the rain must fall on everyone  So rest a while It'll be all right For no one loves you like I do  I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again No, I can't stop the rain, but I will hold you I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again I can't stop the rain But I will hold you 'till it goes away  When the  rain comes, I will hold you

      I've been getting along well with Patrick- hoorray! It's been a pretty all right week so far, and I've liked the weather although it's bound to get worse soon.   Today my stomach has been incredibly acidic. I took some Aleve for pain relief, and though it worked marvelously, it was also so strong that my stomach's been acidic all day. I ate two lunches and ate more when I came home as well as drank lots of milk in attempt to neutralize it a bit, and my stomach's still burning. It's just as though I were throwing wood in fire.  And now, for the total release:  WHAT IN THE FRYING FISHSTICKS ARE THESE PEOPLE TRYING TO DO TO ME!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!  Festival next week.  a) We'll suck b) I'll have to miss all of the school day except first block on the day right before exams begin c) I'll very likely have to come home really late and pull an all nighter for the calculus exam d) The week after, I really don't feel like finishing this post anymore.   Quote of the day:  "Fran! Don't let the acid get to your head!!" --Kim (in choir, as I griped about my acidic stomach)    "Cigarette" by Yellowcard  Watching the days burning out like a cigarette, just a few drags to go You built me up and you broke me down, somehow Everything just seemed so clear to me, nothing left to know I'll love you right and i'll love you pure, right now  How can you say that it's too late To save us now  And I would wait for you if you would wait for me And I will wait for you if you will wait for me  Intoxicated, the edge is serrated, so easily torn from the core I blushed the first time, but you blushed the last time my eyes hit your mind Regenerated these feelings of hatred, I long for your love ever more You built me up and you broke me down this time

      Wow and bleah. Partly eh.   I'll elaborate when so inclined, but there's so much to worry about now that I'm back to Earth that the inclination is set to be postponed, perhaps.   I hate being on Earth.   Oh, and I looooooooooooooooooove Eric Nelson! (No, no, not that way, no, no. You know. And if you're you and that you particularly--yes, that you!-- you, indeed, my dear you, do know!)  Oh, indeed, the caffeine has worn out, it's been a long trip, and for once I totally adore Newnan as I relate the word to "comfortable bed--yay--woo!"

Shall be fun trying to study for AP exams during every break we get (lunch and dinner)... Mrs. Stallings is  driving us  down there. Oy me. Bizarth will come Friday instead of Thursday, which might be a yay in my case.   Well, at least Hinkle will be there... and Sara is cool, too...   And at least I'm having a very good voice day. On that note, I shall, perhaps, sing a bit ( in my range , I hate stupid stuff not in my range) and then get working on the pile of homework and studying that there is to do. *Sigh*  I like this song a whole lot:  "Float On"  by Modest Mouse   I backed my car into a cop car the other day Well, he just drove off, sometimes that's ok I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say Well, you just laughed it off, it was all ok  And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on anyway  Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands Good news will work its way to all them plans We both got piled on sadly the same day Well we'll float on, good news is on the way  And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on ok And we'll all float on   Alright, already we'll all float on Now, don't you worry we'll all float on Alright, already we'll all float on Alright, don't worry, we'll all float on  And we'll all float on Alright, already we'll all float on Alright, don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy We'll all float on  *Sigh*

      Break's over. Back to school Monday.      Wow, that really sucks.     This week was productive. I'm proud of that. Things I learned/realized this week:  1. Women's colleges are not for me.  2. Colleges located in small towns are not for me.  3. Colleges full of dopeheads are not for me. 4. Watch out for Greek life. Read between the lines. *puts on detective hat* 5. Community restrooms are a-okay.   6. Snooty colleges aren't for me, though I kind of already knew that.  7. I'm really graceless. Really really. But it's okay.  8. I know a moron.  9. Okay, maybe more than just one.  10. Pretty shoes are not always as comfortable as they seem. Do not be deceived!  11. Crap. Spring Break is over.    *yawns*

      Er, I typed an update on the *other* journal for the heck of it.   If you miss me incredibly and feel an urgent need to know how I'm doing, go to my deviantart site and read the journal there. I could just paste the contents here, but I'm too lazy.   Oh, and I'm too lazy to paste the URL, too, so just click on the link to the left over there on this page that says, "My Deviantart" (doh!)

      We all knew it was coming.   The tension building up between Bizarth and I finally took its course and exploded...  Today I was forced to miss all of rehearsal because I had to go into the Chemistry room to get help on that lab that I couldn't figure out how to write up. The plan was to get to school at 7.15 and just to be a little bit late to rehearsal, but unfortunately, I couldn't sleep last night and wound up  waking up  at 7.30, which was not a yay at all.   I rushed to get to school and got the help I needed in 5 rushed minutes before the lab was due, and it worked out pretty decently.   I dreaded seeing Bizarth all day, but nonetheless I needed to talk to her; so, at the beginning of class, I did.  I went up to her and started explaining my situation with the lab (omitting the fact that I overslept), and she asked me whether Smith would let me come in and make up the rehearsal time I was missing!! I just kind of looked at her like, "Wtf, mate? Rehearsal's not for a grade!!!" but restrained my sayings to, "Well, it was a homework assignment, and I couldn't do it and needed the help. It was assigned Friday, and I tried it at home and couldn't figure it out."  She then started lamenting over my general tardiness and related irresponsibility. She was being a real bitch, and at one point, I tried to defend myself by attempting to say that AP Exams were coming up and that I was really trying to juggle everything together-- it's not that I don't  care  about music-- that couldn't be farther from the truth, but I have to prioritize with my grades... She interrupted me, of course, and told me that  I needed to listen to her , at which point every nerve in my visage started trembling in order to refrain from bursting into tears.   Well, it didn't work.   She looked at me, said, "Oh, don't cry," and took me with her to her office (I'm sure the entire choir had fun guessing what on Earth was going on). So, yeah. She kept me in there about 20 minutes and confessed her concern that I was shoving music out of the way to make room for everything else and how much that bothered her.  I got my way as far as being able to skip rehearsal Thursday goes, as I have to take a Chemistry test at 7.30 am... Long story there, but B wasn't a happy camper about it. Anyway, at one point she surprised me by asking, "And what would happen if you failed this test? Or made a C in Chemistry?" I told her that I needed the grades and the scholarships for several if not all of my post-high-school ambitions, and she then proceeded to give me a "you don't always have to be the best, you know," speech. I mean, she made good points in that I won't die if I don't do well, but she still doesn't understand that it's not just Chemistry.   Everything's crashing on top of me, it feels like, and I'm trying to hold it together. Sometimes I just have to make some cuts and draw some lines. It's not that I don't  want to  do music-- heck, if I ever digress, it's very likely because I'm doing something musically related! I'm obsessed with music, and without it I'd long have collapsed, but sometimes one has to do what she has to do-- even if it's not necessarily what she  wants  to do. I would choose music over Chemistry or Calculus on most days, I'm pretty sure. However, I'm not sure that that's how I want to spend my life yet, so I can't just risk everything and toss all that I've been working on out in the wind in hopes that I won't later change my mind.    I tried to convey all this to her, but she interrupted me and said that I needed to listen to her-- this was about the point I burst out crying and wound up in her office.   She essentially concluded by telling me that I stress too much and need to calm down (because you know, I   love  stress *note sarcasm*). She then said to come back from Spring Break fresh and try to make a better effort to be a better musician by her standards, pretty much.  I don't really know what to think. I feel a little bit better about Bizarth, but I still think she's a bitch. I don't really know whether I truly can endure any more choir class with her. She has undeniably been really mean to me (particularly lately), and I don't like mean people, as simple a concept as that is...    Okay, well, it was good to get that out.

      Well, as you see, I coded a different template for this thing. It's pretty simple, but I spent a bit arguing with it. I took an already made one and turned it inside out and upside-down. Yeah, I'm not going to be a computer engineer anytime soon.  So, I still have to write up half of the stupid, unfathomable lab. And I've yet to start problems.  I think I'll have to test Thursday morning at 7.30 am instead of in class on Tuesday, as Smith gave us that option... I do believe I'll have to take it.   Here's my favourite Chemistry song (and I relate more than you could imagine):   "Chem 6A" by Switchfoot    Nothing but a chemical in my head It's nothing but laziness Cause I don't wanna read the book I'll watch the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else my age  I think I'd rather play around And I think I'd rather watch TV Cause I don't wanna face my fears I'll watch the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else I'm just like everybody else  Because I don't wanna be here I don't wanna see this now It's all wrong but it's alright And I don't wanna be here And I don't wanna study now It's all wrong but it's alright  I don't know what love is I don't know who I am And if I ever want to find out I'll watch the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else my age  I don't wanna change the world And I don't wanna be someone I don't wanna write the book I'll make the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else I'm just like everybody else  I don't wanna be here I don't wanna see this now It's all wrong but it's alright And I don't wanna be here And I don't wanna study now It's all wrong but it's alright

      1) Using band names, spell out your name.  Five for Fighting Radiohead Aha No Use for a Name Cranberries, The Eagles, The Strokes, The Coldplay Apex Theory, The   2) Have you ever had a song written about you? A famous one involving my name... and then an attempt to a song by a little-known individual *shakes head in retrospect*  3) What song makes you cry? Quite a few, but possibly "The Cadillac of the Skies" or "Your Congratulations" by Alanis Morissette  4) What song makes you happy? I know this is really backwards, but "Your Horoscope for Today" by Weird Al and "Life's Gonna Suck" by Denis Leary are in the list. Then, can't beat Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy". Then there's also "African Herbman" and "Buffalo Soldier" of Marley's, and can't forget "No Woman, No Cry" and "One Love". Then, there's "U R" by Alanis Morrisette... and "Steven's Last Night in Town" by Ben Folds Five, and last but not least, "Witch Doctor" by the Cartoons (what?! I like that song!!)  5) What do you like to listen to before bed? Depends on my mood, but often Radiohead's  Pablo Honey  or anything Badly Drawn Boy.  6)Name a song by Coal Chamber: "Empty Jar", though I don't remember what it sounds like. I never was really into that kind of stuff at all, but Renee used to be...   7) Who was/were your idol/s when you were younger? 12 years ago: Christian, a dude we knew who played the piano  enchantingly  10 years ago: Blur! Now: Blur, still! I know, odd. Uhh, well, I actually listen to a wide range of stuff, but I still love Blur, although I will have to include that Coldplay is an unbelievably talented group in general. For individuals, I'd have to say that the pianist of Ben Folds Five was unbelievable, the drummer of 311 kicks total butt, Graham Coxon remains one of the best guitarists in my book (Hendrix taken for granted, but I guess you know that), Joshua Bell- no words there, 311's bass, again, is awesome, and well, what can I say? I love Damon's voice...   8) First album you ever bought?  Hmmm... with  my  money out of my own pocket? I think it was Radiohead's  OK Computer , actually.    Okay, I've been digressing from my homework for entirely too long, although I still haven't a possible clue over how to write up that infernally stupid lab.

      Wow. I have a lot of crap. I mean a lot. At about 1 am I was hit with a "must clean room now" frenzy. My room really isn't that large, but it is now 5.12 am and I just finished.   Note to self: stop saving crap and start getting rid of it!!!  Earlier I called the dude at 99x (can't think of the name, I'm not sure I can think right now, it's so late (or early?)) because he said to call him because no one was calling him and we had a nice and interesting conversation about my cleaning of the room and his being up since 8 am. It was good.  And do you know what the greatest thing about finally finding the right college will be?   To be able to freely toss out all the college mail that infests every mere corner of my room-- well, maybe not the corners, but any plain surface that enables me to say, "it's not on the floor!" Honestly, I've got shoeboxes and shoeboxes and stacks and stacks-- my telescope is buried under a massive stack of college mail, as is my vanity. Bahh.   So now I'm super ranting about nothing and I think I'm going to head to bed so I can get up, finish my laundry (how did I manage to wind up doing my sister's boyfriend laundry, too, I wonder? I feel like a mom), vacuum, and get crackin' on immense mounds of work...   Furthermore, I hate DST. This whole one less hour to sleep deal is going to throw me off in an overly disgusting fashion.    Oh, and there is now a thick, burgundy red streak in my hair.   "Brain Stew" by Green Day  I'm having trouble trying to sleep  I'm counting sheep but running out As time ticks by  And still I try  No rest for crosstops in my mind  On my own... here we go   My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed  Dried up and bulging out my skull My mouth is dry My face is numb  Fucked up and spun out in my room  On my own... here we go   My mind is set on overdrive  The clock is laughing in my face  A crooked spine  My sense dulled  Passed the point of delerium  On my own... here we go

       Current mood:  glad and appreciative of peaceful solitude  Currently listening to:  Yeah Yeah Yeahs - "Maps"   I love this song.    Life (even out of the jungle!) has scoowampled to be pretty hectically busy even though summer vacation landed its long sought-after bum in my way finally; nonetheless, I've been having much fun. Yesterday I gots me butt majorly kicked at bowling, but 'twas very good times-ly. (SHUT UP. Yes, you know I'm talking to you if you're you, you.)  Today was Orlando Jr.'s graduation party. I'm copiously proud of him for round-about obtaining his diploma. His next intendment is the army; he's already set to leave on August 26, and I pride and respect him for picking himself up and realizing that he can make it through something in life. I honestly believe in him and think he will do great.   Otherwise, the baby rescued me... Although the food was ambrosial and I ate far more than I should have (even my aunt admitted that I have, indeed, gained weight *insert frown here*), the actuality of being present was asphyxiating. My nuisance revolved around innerving morons, mainly. Because this was a supposedly more intimate party than what things like these usually turn out to be, Orlando had but a few friends over, and their parental units unfortunately either decided to tag along or were officially invited. Certain witches that Aunt Juliana appeared to befriend were gossiping to no end. I realize it may sound as though I were doing the same right now, but I was highly irked because they were nettlesome without minding their own flaws and businesses. A guy present, likely 22 or 23 years old, had a 7-month-old baby. They criticized him in any way possible behind his back, and that really angered me. First of all, the guy was incredibly nice, and secondly, I thought he was doing a good job. The baby is healthy, and he takes care of it and his significant other he had the baby with (I don't know whether he's married). I respect the simple fact that he and the girl are working and sticking together, and he really seemed as though he were a good dad. It was brilliant in the literal sense of the word to observe the light that infested his face every time he saw Riley, the baby. The witches ridiculed his job and his decisions on raising the baby and anything that could eventually catenate onto such topics. Grrr!!!  Therefore, the only other alternative was transfering to the scorchingly hot inferno that was outside-- anything but gossip!! There, the one thing that I truly despise for people to do to me was done to me. The present group of "adults" seemed very good at patronizing me and crushing any idealism I might have managed not to lose priorly. However, they didn't succeed in the latter beyond an extent. I feel as though I shouldn't listen to anything that comes out of their mouths as they all screwed up their lives. Besides that, they flat out told me that all I should be concerned with is making money, which is against anything I've ever believed. Surely, money is nice, and I do want to be able to sustain myself, but it is absolutely not the most important thing to look out for. Call me crazy, but I maintain that it is possible to find something to do with one's life that can truly make one rejoice. Here's an even crazier idea: I'm going to find something that applies to me so,  and  I'm going to embrace it. So, ha! There is a dedication on an AMV: "For everyone who never learned to give up hope". It's too bad that so many people learn to give up hope. I'm trying really hard not to be one of them.  Anyway, things got a lot better once the plethora of ignoramuses started departing. We and the fellow with the baby were the last to leave. The baby was one of the coolest babies I've ever come across! She is very intelligent and interesting. She loves food, and she investigates things more than "normal babies" seem to. She doesn't cry a lot, and she is relatively happy. Finally, she is a tryer. She almost started walking and actually succeded in standing up on her own as we were cheering her to try, an idea she was fast to seize. Yay for clever babies!!!      I might should could would maybe attempt cleaning the jungle a bit more, maybe. Ren Fest with a Kat tomorrow! Yay!

I think I was about 6 or 7 years old. First pet: Campanellino the fish (transl: little bell... don't ask! I was 7!!) First piercing: my ears used to be pierced, but that's a tragic story which resulted in my never wanting to have any sort of piercing again.

First enemy: Stefano Raiola, this guy I went to elementary school with. He thought he was so smart... I WON!!! Mwahahahhaa... well, wait... when I was in first grade, there was this jerk I beat up...  First favorite musician: I'd say Blur because I still love them...  Lasts  Last car ride: I came in about 20 minutes ago... Ale and I went to get coffee and meandered about various stores, the last one being Hastings, where I completed an order for my AP books that I have to read this summer. I got a nice deal, too. Cheap, cheap, cheap!!!  Last kiss: does my stuffed bunny count? Last library book checked out:  Cracking the AP Chemistry Exam  by the Princeton Review... Last movie watched: some ABC family movie... it was good, though! Last beverage drank: a Starbuck's Grande Cafe` Mocha   =-D Last food consumed: I think a slice of watermellon... man, I'm hungry. Last phone call: Heather called me!!!! She's ALIVE!!! No, really, I was so incredibly happy to finally hear from her.  Last time showered: 6.00-ish... (yes, pm... It's summer!) Last CD played: Blur's  Think Tank  Last website visited: Matt's blog  Now  Single or Taken: as single as single can be, and appreciating it, I think! Sex: uh... well, I'd like to think I'm a female... Birthday: July 14, 1987. I wasn't aware that changed often. Sign: the disease of the zodiac, Cancer Siblings: Alessandra, 24 Hair color: dark, coffee brown Eye color: dark, coffee brown Shoe size: this is a very complicated subject. It really depends on the shoe, but my foot is generally huge, and sometimes 11's don't fit... However, I do own some 10's here and there... eh... go figure! Height: 5'6"... Matt Jackson, are you really 5'8"??  Right now what are you  Wearing: Dark blue jeans, black fitted tee, socks... Thinking about: college, what will happen in the next year, whether I will bomb the SAT again next week, how much I love this song, all the memories it brings up (meaning the one listed as "currently listening to"), how much I'm going to miss my hair... yes, I think about too many things at once.

       Current mood:  undescribable  Currently listening to:  Badly Drawn Boy - "Cause a Rockslide"  It amazes me how many things happen in one single month. It seems as though the month of May were a blur... Essentially, all that actually took place was, indeed, a blur.   A blur, you ask? No, I mean not massive listening of the music of the favourite band, I only mean a Blur.   I'm not sure this month should have even happened, save for the fact that the end of the school year created a solid mezzanine to stand upon as opposed to a desperate spiral moving in reverse from what I'd like it to.   Hmm... how about that?

       Current mood:  satisfied  Currently listening to:  Bob Marley - "No Woman, No Cry"  Weee! Grades came in today!!!! I am SO excited!!! It went a lot better than I  had even hoped!! I made a 100 in AP Chem for the semester and therefore the year *insert really huge smiley here* and a 100 in AP Quackulus for the nine weeks and semester and year, which was MOST CERTAINLY UNEXPECTED!!!!!! I'm so satisfied!!! Of course that crap class of Coach Morris's gave an A but not a 100 though it was such an easy class, but it hopefully won't have altered my GPA nor rank too much *crosses fingers and knocks on wood*. I guess we will see when I go back to school and need my transcript for colleges, eh?   Nonetheless, I'm really pleased. I feel like I've worked hard this year, and I got the results I worked for.   Today I spent time with Sela for the first time in virtually three years, and it was really good and fun. I think I might have tanned a bit, too, which is a yay as I was pretty pale. This summer has been odd in the sense that I'm not getting much done thus far; I always say to myself that I'll get things done, and then people call me complaining that I haven't done anything with them all year and I more than gladly admit that they're right and do stuff. Don't get me wrong, I'm loving it because I missed seeing my friends and having a life, but I really should start trying a little harder to get things I need to get done done. On that note, I'm going to go clean my room a little... maybe...

       Current mood:  exasperated  Currently listening to:  Badly Drawn Boy - "File Me Away"    If you speak Spanish, mi abuela tiene una gana de hoder unica!!!  If you don't speak Spanish, let's leave it at the fact that my grandmother is driving me insane.  I cleared any outings for the day so as to be able to get more things done in peace. I wanted to stay home because I've been out entirely too much since school let out, and I haven't had time to rest yet, but rest at home simply doesn't seem like an option. Yesterday the idea was equal, but my mom was driving me insane, so I ended up spending most of the day out. Today, my grandmother is being a hypochondriac to the fullest, and she's driving me insane.   I'm trying to compile an Italian phrase book for Mr. Sizemore and the group from NHS going to Italy as they asked me to do it and I said I'd do it, but I have a terrible headache. My grandmother just needs to freakeding GO AWAY!!! Why can't I be in peace on my darned summer vacation, dead gummit?? The only way to have any bit of peace is to lock myself in my room and pretend to be dead... agh!!!   Otherwise, I've been working with paperwork all day, and I loathe the Italian Consulate evermore.   Anyhow, I just needed to vent on that.    I scheduled my senior pictures for October, and I feel old. At least they're scheduled, though! I think I will go for the simplest package possible, as I am truly not a picture person. I wasn't even going to do them, but then I realized that I don't ever really get professional pictures done, and these might just turn out good for a change, maybe. *knock on wood*  I have a hair appointment for the 10th of June at 1.15 pm... to cut my hair. Yes, I'm going to donate it finally, which means it's getting *gasp* cut. I'm already having emotional struggles about it, so I'm sure I'll cry a storm when it's actually time to let it go. My drive to get through this thing is simply the fact that I'll make a little girl very happy (or maybe 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 little girls-- my hair has gotten so long...).  I hope it won't look like crap once it's cut. I think I want to try a shag, but I'll follow the hair stylist dude's advice, for he did a very nice job advising my mom and cutting her hair, and besides, he's gay. Gay guys tend to give really good advice about stuff like that. Even if the hair looks like total schmite, it will grow back, so everything will be okay. I suppose the hard part is parting with an image of myself that I've become so comfortable with and used to.    I'll get over it eventually, really. Well, I'd better get back to the Italian writing... toodles!  Hey, blogger has photo hosting now! Duuuude!    urlLink    Testing 1-300. This is a sample picture from my computer. You can probably figure that out

       Current mood:  sunburnt  Currently listening to:  the television   I find it kind of sad that now I actually seem to have the time to post (even though I still should be doing something else).   Anyhow, 6 Flags was pretty fun, I guess, but it's amazing how, as you get older, rides get more and more unexciting. I rode the Superman for the first time ever, though, and that was quite a wow. Although I'm a regular screamer by reflex, I'm normally pretty relaxed, but, from what I recall, I think I said, "I want my mommy" more times in a row than ever in my life as we were getting near the first freefall (and I was never really prone to saying the phrase growing up). The ride was, indeed, very awesome. I rode in the front, and it really did feel as though one were flying.   Otherwise, I'm slightly sunburnt and have developed flip flop tan lines *shakes head*.    I also learned that the only thing that doesn't get old is, indeed, coffee. Tee hee.

       Current mood:   heavily  pensive  Currently listening to:  Jason Mraiz - "The Remedy"  Tired and much to do, but both Mrs. Smith's and Kim's parties were loads o' fun.   Today I need to clean up a bit and then spend the night with Jessica so as to awaken early enough to arrive at Six Flags early enough for a fun day. W00t!  My back hurts incredibly, and I don't know why. I don't recall ever pulling the muscle that's bothering me oh-so-badly. Ehhh. It's been hurting since yesterday afternoon in the early, and it's starting to worry me a bit. I just hope that super roller coaster riding tomorrow won't totally crack my back in half. If so, everyone's invited to attend my funeral!    Italy paperwork is still to be finalized... *boils with anger at the mother* I said I'd do it if she needed me to, but nooooooooo! "Oh, don't worry about it, I'll take care of it!" Yeah, right! I should have known better than believing her. So, I guess I'll need to do that very soon as I still do want to leave the country.    I'm confuzzled as always, and suddenly I'm in a state of utter "oh-wow-I-have-no-idea-just-what-I'm-thinking-or-doing-help!!!". It's never too pleasant. I just hope I can figure something effective out very very very soon, as I am copiously uncomfortable with the current situation. I'm sure I confused you beyond belief by this point, but this was a selfishly typed section for my simple relief, and I must be utterly taciturn about everything and anything around it.   My house and room and bathroom and fish need help, so I'd better go, as I haven't much time left!

      Dudes and dudettes, I'm a senior. Yes-sir-ree, a senior senior. W00t!!! I only have 178 days of torture left!!! Maybe even 176 if I can manage not to be out and ill!!! WHOO!!! I'm excited. Gradulation yesterday was good times. Jumped and cheered madly for all the fortunate fellers that I love oh-so-much that are leaving. It'll be my turn in a year! That's really exciting.   Though I was envious, it really hit me last night, and I just thought, "Whoa."   Indeed, whoa. I feel so old yet so young, and it's actually a pretty good feeling. I'm not sure what I'll be doing with my life, but I have a few ideas to try out, and whatever will be, will be. I have a life to go to decide.   "Everything is gonna be alright."  Well, I have two parties to go to and another shower to take as the five minutes I spent outside grossened me. Tada!

       Current mood: Ridiculous  Currently listening to: Jimmy Buffett - "Pina Colada"  I am such a dork. Or maybe in this case the better word is goober?   I was supposed to wake up now, but because I'm so used to getting up super early no matter how tired I am, I woke up an hour ago thinking it was now. So, I go up to my mom's room ten minutes ago and ask if she's ready.  She kind of looks at me and says, "Now? It's only 9:00." "No, it's not." "Yes it is. Look," as she points at the clock.  Then, it finally dawnes on me that I hadn't really heard the alarm clock as I thought and that I had, indeed, screwed myself over to one less hour of sleep. Eh. At least it's not as bad as that time that I woke up at 8 pm thinking I was super late for school. That time, I actually got ready, walked in the living room to see my sister and her boyfriend watching TV, and interrogated them about what silly reason would cause them to be up together at 8 am watching TV. Then they elightened me, and I felt stupid. Hehe.  Well, I've got about 40 minutes to kill, so breakfast it is! Yum! And then off to school for 2 pointless blocks and a Crackulus exam (wish me luck!).   Arrivederci!

       Current mood: Disappointed  Currently listening to: Jimmy Eat World - "A Praise Chorus"  Wow. What a day.   It was boring, boring, boring, but it wasn't going so badly until the end. I finished all possible Calculus extra credit, and that was a yay. Upon my return to Chemistry, I discovered that the class was viewing  Lorenzo's Oil , and, though I'd seen the movie a million times, I paid attention to it anyways... It's a depressing movie, so I guess the odd feelings started there.   Today was a general intentional or unintentional Francesca-bashing day, for whichever unexplicable or logical reason. Nearly every person I spoke to said something not nice to me, and, when that happens time after time after time in a short span, one starts to be irritated or maybe even a bit depressed.   The worst was choir, of course. Ms. Bizarth called the usual All-State auditioners up for a conference and started blabbering that she had looked up in the rule book that, in order to be able to audition, a student who is only in choir one term would have to do every single mere performance with the choir during the term he/she/it was skipping. Why, I wonder, did she have to go look it up? Likely because she's Bizarth, and her favourite hobby lies in complicating peoples' lives.   Anyhow, she successfully talked Mary Anna into dropping AP Psychology for Choir and Grayson into something similar. When it came to my turn to be spoken to, she bellowed, "Well, you already know what I've got to say to you." She rambled on and eventually articulated, "Even if you were not to change your schedule, your schedule is insane! You're going to kill yourself! I mean, I don't... I don't know. You've become a basket case, and I feel sorry for you..." and then she continued. Although I know I shouldn't care what the old, fat witch says, that still hurt and partly angered me. I realize that I've had my downs and, indeed, barely circumvented a breakdown, but I did make it. Not only did I make it, but I learned a lot in the process--more than any single year so far, actually. I feel as though I can handle let downs and the typical hectic life a bit better now, and I dare claim added maturity.   I finally felt like I had things together, and she just sort of put me down for no reason... and it hurt. Her belief that she knew just how my entire life was going based on the one and only time that I burst into a million tears because she was being her old, mean, witchy self to me also aggravated me. Just who does this woman think she is?  She yapped something about worrying about my mental health, but I can't say I believe her in that respect (not that I really do believe her in any). If she were sincerely worried about me, wouldn't she be a bit more nice and understanding? And wouldn't she try not to put me down every occasion she had? Wouldn't she stop telling me I'm crazy?  Well, I'm not crazy, for the record. I just really need to graduate.    Bleh. I'd better study a bit for the Calculus exam tomorrow.

       Current mood: Vacant  Currently listening to: Badly Drawn Boy - "The Shining"  Currently reading:  Dove Nascono le Stelle  (transl:  Where Stars are Born ) by Margherita Hack    And so it ends, nearly.   I technically no longer have to attend Chemistry class, as today we turned in a lab as our final. I might sleep in Thursday, but tomorrow I'll work on Calculus bonus during Chem class... Yeah...   Calculus is almost over, and that's a yay. I hope the exam won't be too bad... the last thing I need is a grade dragger-downer.   Coach Morris is being totally unfair in his grading in US History, and though we tried to appeal and stand up for our rights, he wouldn't listen nor quiver. Bah. I just sincerely hope that his stupid class doesn't drag my GPA down to ashes!  Choir's all over and vacant. No more Kim... *sniffle sniffle*  Today Kim and I had our cafe smoothie that was planned a few months ago, our last junior-senior get-together. It was rather fun. We meandered about consuming massive amounts of caffeine, smoothiness, and super energizing stuff and jammed out to a music sampler at Target. An action that none other than we, the Waiter Thugs, would complete, indeed. (Peace,   By the by by, we have a fish now. It's a fighter fish dude, and it's blue. I named it Giotto (after the artist). Of course, I didn't ask for a fish, but apparently it's my fish now, as I obviously got stuck having to take care of it. I feel really bad for him because he's stuck in that stupid tiny tank. I am very much against the trapping of fish in fish tanks. Although I'm not sure the lives of fish are much fun anyway, I bet that being stuck in a little glass bowl with, perhaps, a little plastic castle must be infinitely obnoxious.  Shah and Asia are super fighting these days, and I can't stand either one of them. Although I generally love cats, I'm not sure I'll have any as an adult when I move into my own place.   School has gotten unbelievably pointless. I really, truly, and honestly cannot wait for it to be over.   Miss Katherine thinks I should date around, and I might actually give the idea a momentary shot. She evidently has a list of set-ups, and I figure that I'm young, at an age where most normal people date, and I'm not sure I have much to lose by trying it. Besides, I might be bored for a week or two!   Well, maybe I should go to bed and shower, or, rather, shower and go to bed, since I should get up for school tomorrow, even if it is a bit pointless... Oh, I almost forgot!! Today Mrs. Smith gave us super-packets of stuff for making it through AP Chemistry, and it was really exciting. The folder contained: -3 sheets of freshman rocket paper -1 sheet of goldenrod -1 sheet of equilibrium shift paper -1/8 of a sheet of ashless filter paper -1 scratch and sniff sticker -1 certificate for completing the ChemOlympiad competition in March -1 mole dollar -1 periodic table of the elements with pictures of each (yay! Now I have TWO periodic charts to go on my wall!!!) -1 bumper sticker-- mine was particularly awesome because it looked cool and said the coolest thing: "I'm undersaturated-- I can take more!!!"  I   Well, I should go to bed at some point.

      This entire "having nothing much left to do" deal is unusual to me. Today, I went to my locker and put all my books in it, consequently realizing that I'm not going to need a backpack anymore for the rest of the schoolyear (all 6 days of it)... That's never happened to me before.   Mrs. Landreth stopped me as I was approaching the lunch room, likely because I must have had a most stupid expression of disbelief on my face, and, when I explained my dilemma to her, she laughed and said I should keep bringing my backpack anyway... Hmmm... nah, let's not do that.   All that there is essentially left to do is to take a US History 9 weeks exam and a Crackulus one.  I slept so much today. I literally arrived home, ate because I was hungry, and went to bed and didn't get up until 9. I'm going to be going back to bed in about 2-3 hours. It's beautiful. I feel like such a bum and I should have been cleaning the jungle (my room currently), but I feel so rested!  I can't believe the year's practically over. I'm excited about it, but I'm also really going to miss people. Props to me for minimal tears at the choir concert, though! (Kim, DOON'T LEEEEEEEEEEAAAAVE MEEEEEEEEEEE!!! *sob sob sob*) Well, at least now that I won't have anyone to complain to about Chemistry anymore, I won't really have Chemistry to complain about anymore, either.    I feel like I've learned a lot this year, and I feel as though I've grown and matured much along with other folks. All the same, at this point, I also feel like I've learned to be more immature, and I don't know how I feel about that. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened, too. I guess you could say that this year was just... there. A year of hard work and butt-busting, a year of minimal mother-fighting (although not totally nonexistant mother-fighting), a year of depressing good music, a year of dancing (or, rather, attempts to dancing), a year of sorrow, a year of cracking up into laughter, a year of coffee, a year of getting pissed off at losing SC II battles but rejoicing at Tekken-Tag butt-kickin', a year of not keeping in touch with people I love even if I saw them every day, a year of learning to be open-minded and accepting... a year of feeling apart from God...    An exhausting year, indeed. I shed no tears as I salute it. Well, maybe a few, but anything for Kim, even if it's undesired public speaking... =-)   Of course,    "Seasons of Love" from Rent   Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear FIve hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes How do you measurea year?

      Rain and humidity oddly don't go well together.   Let me rephrase: rain and humidity and hot weather don't go well together. Except for at night, when the hot isn't oh-so-bloody-hot anymore and feels nice instead.   Nonetheless, I like rain.  I'm rather glad it rained today.    I'm always hungry, and I cannot walk a straight line.  I feel relieved because the AP Chemistry exam is over. Pass or fail, it's over. I am such a happy camper! It was a hard test, indeed, and one of the two lab questions was totally written by a crackhead (read: I bombed one of the lab questions), but overall, I didn't feel unbelievably terrible about the whole deal *KNOCK ON WOOD*. I was really nervous initially as everything that could have gone wrong the day before and the morning of the test did, in fact, go wrong, but once I started actually taking the darned thing, apathy kicked in--that was extremely helpful in getting through it all right.    Choir concert was decent. Extremely disorganized, but fun as always. Got to see Justin. Yay for Justin! Got to see Laura and Sierra and Jonathan, too, and that was also "yay!"  I cannot wait for school to finally end (save for the fact that I only have a week to bring my Crackulus grade up!!!) I really sincerely cannot wait to get out of here, although there's a possibility that I might not be able to go to Genova after all due to mom's odd fears... I'm really happy to simply be leaving the country, but I really wanted to go to Genova for various reasons...  First of all, I haven't been there in five years, and that is a long time. Secondly, I miss it. Thirdly, I really want to see people. Fourthly but absolutely not leastly, I want to go back to my old church...   I really want coffee. Is anyone up for a profound conversation over coffee?  (Call me anytime)   I'm always hungry, and I c-a-n-n-o-t walk a straight line.

Could we go downtown To the middle of the world? You were always such a pretty girl And you told me I was beautiful "There's no poetry between us," Said the paper to the pen, "And I get nothing for my trouble But the ink beneath my skin" If your clothes are getting weary And your soul's gone out of style Blame the miracle mile And the bottom of the ladder Paint your eyes and hide the tatters What's the matter baby?

      Ahhh. There. All coded.   I just got back from a Chemistry study session at Mrs. Smith's house. I'm incredibly relieved because the entire time I was there counted as extra credit, which is wonderful in every aspect as all I needed were 65 minutes more, which was due tomorrow after school, and there was no way I could have done it what with Women's Ensemble rehearsal. So happy!!! Yay.  Otherwise, I will really miss Mrs. Smith. She is truly one of the best teachers I've ever had in the long run. She's certainly ticked me off many times and made me cry with her assignments, but, regardless of how well or badly I will do Tuesday on the AP test, I feel as though I've learned a fair share. Besides this, I've also acquired some life lessons from her; every now and then, while I'm thinking about stuff, I think about things she's pointed out about life, and it helps a lot.    Met Katherine's boyfriend- excuse me, best friend- (=-) ) from New York. He was really quiet and seemed nice. He was really hot, too, but that's besides the point.   I had too many brownies. I think I'm going to go do what I haven't done all weekend save for the last 3 hours and study some chemistry, mayhaps.   Adieu!!

      You search, but you know not what for.   You just search. And you wonder whether anyone else remotely contemplates the same things you do, unlike the fellow who goes and names an idea as though he were the only one to ever think of it-- how egotistical! And then you realize that it doesn't really matter, after all... Nothing really matters, and it's not really a bad prospect to live at all. People make it out to sound as though it were a bad thing, something terrible, but it's actually the best thing that could happen to you, to follow that line of thought.  And you fear criticism for unknown reasons, since you inadvertenly pour out your own criticism on the unaware's head from day to day, regardless of whether they stop being unaware or continue doing so. You do care then, or do you? Do they, really?  And then another day goes by, and another, and another. And you find yourself, you think, but you don't really. And then you might have. What do you need? Maybe to go back and see what's remote, what's been left behind that you never even knew you had. Will it work? Worth a shot, indeed. Are you sad? No. Are you happy? No.   What are you?  "I'm a human, that's what I am!" bellows your head, flapping its internal yap, but it's unheard-well, maybe not completely, but mostly so. But are you really? Or are you just a sheep reincarnated into a human by some mere and odd chance, for neither is related to the other in any earthly nor unearthly way? Well, I suppose they could be related, somehow. Still, I maintain I didn't come from monkeys nor sheep. Sometimes I wonder where I came from, and that's supposedly a shame, a sin. Why? Insecurity is frightening very often, but then, it opens your mind to everything, and that's not so bad a thing. It can be unpleasant, however, particularly when you're so open-minded that you're not sure what you should believe in. And then you're in trouble.   There again, who cares? It's amazing how you can go to sleep and think, "You know, I might never wake come tomorrow, mate," but then, if you do know for a fact that you won't, in fact, awaken, suddenly it does matter. It matters a lot, and it's not all right anymore. Sometimes I think I'm really selfish and nonappreciative, and you know what? I am. But it's normal. It's human nature to want something. It's often inadvertent, but that's why I'm not God.   Mizar's waiting on me.

      Here's someone to admire:   http://www.civicworldwide.org/blogger.htm   I think I found what really matters.  Shoo my unfluctuating, bratty lamentations.         Shah's doing better yet again.  Time to study.    "And Nature Smiled" by Allan Koepke    On the hillside grew a lovely rose,  a beauty to behold The sun and rain did bless the rose, and nature smiled, it was told  Proud was the rose midst the widowhood, its fragrance pure as finest gold All creation understood and bowed, as its petals would unfold  Soon the weeds did gather 'round the rose "Share with us your beauty," they asked in coy repose "Give us each one petal, for then we all will be beautiful and worthy, to stand with dignity"  "Run from the beggar's ticks, run from the horsetail, run, run away, " was the cry of the loon "Stay," cried the shepherd's purse, "Stay," cried the thorn tree "Listen to your heart, " came a plea from the moon  Then a stillness settled on the land The rose, in all her widsom, stretched out a gentle hand and touched each one around her; none was to be denied She knew the secret of their beauty came from deep inside  "Each of you is part of a plan from above.  You give life to others, there is no greater love Be strong inone another, and then you all will see you won't need any petals, you have your dignity"  On the hillside great a lovely rose,  a friend amid the wild The sun and rain did bless the rose, and nature smiled  And nature smiled.

      Shah's all right. He came home today. He's very weak and we have to super vigilate him, as well as the whole special diet factor, but I am just so happy that he's alive.   He's sleeping right now, as I just had to give him a bath as he'd peed all over himself. But at least he's peeing!!!   Now I need to clean the bathroom. And then take another shower. And then study.   Yeah, that whole studying thing didn't exactly happen this weekend. Pretty much the whole weekend revolved around the pet hospital, but at least Shah's alive, and he's more important than a stupid College Board test on any given day at any given time.   I'm a bit worried again, but I suppose that had to happen. It'll be almost over in two weeks and totally over in four. *Sigh*  Shah and I had a 15-minute "purr-meow" conversation. He told me everything he had to go through and cried about it, but I was glad to hear him open up.  In case you're wondering how I talk to my cat, it's simple: a bit of English, a bit of Italian, and a bit of Shahlang.  A sample conversation such as today's: Shah: "Purrrr meeeeoww mooo muurfle!!! Purr!!!" Me    : "Purr purr purr I knoow! Ti voglio bene!! Purrr purrr mooo moo purr murfle!!"  (Although today's involved no English nor Italian really, as we were at extreme conditions)  Okay, back to work now.

So far, in 24 hours, my cat's bladder nearly broke, my washing machine broke, my toe nearly broke, my computer's half crapped even though it's pretty new, and I've yet to start studying.

      Shah's very ill. He's in the clinic right now, possibly to be transfered at the pet hospital in Fayetteville.   Yesterday he was feeling very ill and mom and Ale took him to the clinic to find out that his bladder was superfull and he couldn't urinate. He may have kidney stones. Actually, the doctor thought he was set to die. They called yesterday, and I was informed of the whole situation when I got home, at about 11.00 pm. Cried loads, but today I called as soon as I woke up, and the doctor says he's doing a little better. Not by much, but any step further from death is a relief.   Evidently, his bladder was the size of a grapefruit, and he's urinating more blood than urine. He's been on IV's and fluids all night, and they have run some x-rays. He has a [insert word that I cannot think of in English right this very now] in him, and it's going to stay there until his urine starts clearing up a bit.   I really hope he keeps getting better. We're all extremely worried and teary about the whole deal... I don't know what I'll do if Shah dies... I mean, we've had the cat for almost 9 years. His birthday is May 5. He's like a family member, and he's very treasured. I just feel so awful that I've been so busy that I haven't bothered to spend time with him nearly all semester-- particularly not this entire week.   We're going to go see him today before going to Kim's graduation tea; just *whimper*           =-(      "Everything's Not Lost"  by Coldplay    If you ever feel neglected, If you ever think all is lost, I'll be counting up my demons, yeah, Hoping everything's not lost, Everything's not lost, When I'm counting up my demons.

       Current mood:  blank  Currently listening to:  Sugarcult - "Crashing Down"    98% of the teenage population does/has tried pot. If you're part of the 2% who hasn't, copy this in your journal.   Whoa. I feel special.    For the past few days I've been up to saying hello and goodbye to friends and becoming ever more excited about my trip to Italy. I can't wait to see so many people and do so many things, and I can't wait to go through the old attic at our home up there and see what I can rediscover or actually discover-- Lord knows that uprooting and rerooting across the globe meant leaving so very much behind...  I have seen essentially almost everyone I had made plans to see, and that was very nice, considering that once I'll return I will be directed straight to hell (school, of course) and won't have time to do anything enjoyable for the most part. I even spent time with Ale. Whoa.Her life and mine have not exactly been coinciding in schedule very well lately. By the way, not only is the sucker going to see 311 without me while I'm gone, but also she may be able to get backstage passes. I'm happy for her and yet so very envious... hehe.  I'm having many mixed feelings about her tentative semi permanent move, but it had to happen sooner or later. It is really weird to realize that in only five years each one of us will have her own life and likely live in a different state or country than the other and spend only holidays together because that's all that life will allow. It happens. It's just that I love my sister so very much, so the aforementioned parting will be a little difficult, even if I have complained muchly about our relationship lately. I lied-- I don't honestly want her to go.   I have been packing, too. I haven't gotten very far, yet, either. Kind of not really as fun as it sounds.  My mother is getting on nerves more than she has been the past month, and I am glad to get away from her for a little while.  I'm not even there yet and I already fancy the idea of not coming back muchly. Furthermore, I am paranoid and think that something will happen between now and Tuesday at 4:30 p.m....  yes, I know, I know. I worry entirely too much... but I can't help it... and you honestly can't really blame me.    Whew.    I thought this would be semi-appropriate. Two more days, babay.   "Stuck in America" by Sugarcult    Today, I changed It's too late Cause everyone stayed the same I'm gone, so long Break out, cause I'm better off on my own  Today, I changed It's too late Cause every town feels the same I'm different and you're distant Add it up and it makes no difference  Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood Everybody's gonna break it up today Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood Runnin just to get away  Stuck in America Stuck in America I'm lost in America Stuck in America  Today, I changed New town with the same old face One way to shake this place that I can't escape  Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood Everybody's gonna watch it burn today Everybody's talking about waking up the neighborhood I'm still trying to escape  Stuck in America Stuck in America I'm lost in America Stuck in America  Today, today  Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood Everybody's gonna break it up today Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood All I ever wanted was to get away  Stuck in America Stuck in America Stuck in America Stuck in America  Get away, get away, get away, get away (all that shit that you put me through)  Today, I changed

       Current mood:  happy and excited  Currently listening to:  The Postal Service - "Nothing Better" (imagine that!)  I did it!!! I got the hair cut this morning!! It looks so good!!! I love it!!!  It was one heck of a strange feeling seeing my hair lying on a tabletop in front of me. Odd stuff, I tell you, but I didn't cry at all. O'Neil, the feller who cut it for me, was so awesome. He was so very excited, too, because he thought it was great that he could turn my long-haired head into a short-haired one (he likes short hair a lot). Oooh! All the assistants and other hairstylists at the studio kept walking by to see the progress, and I had an audience by the time O'Neil was done. Hehe... everyone liked it, and I love it!! I feel so much lighter, honestly.   I think it actually looks better than the long hair, maybe, but I am so happy to have helped someone. It feels really good to fill out a Locks of Love form... and I even get a certificate in the mail for it!!! How cool is that?!  I can do flippy stuff with the hair if I choose, but it's so much work that I doubt I'll choose to a whole lot. The cut should be easy to style within 5-10 minutes, which is a yay, because as you know I'm always running. W00t!!!   Well, as all of you probably know by now, I hate taking pictures, but I compromised and took a quick picture with the crappy camera so you could see *the haircut*...    urlLink    This is it!!!

       Current mood:  tired  Currently listening to:  The Postal Service - "Such Great Heights"  Check out The Postal Service. I like these folks... they're interesting. Good stuff. I think you'd have to have a certain kind of taste to appreciate them, however; just check them out!  TIME WASTER!!! W00t!!  I am:: not necessarily, for "all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream" (Poe) I crave:: my bed I regret:: being an idiot at times I cry:: fairly easily. It's a good way to release stress, in a way... I hate crying around people, though, although sometimes it just happens I care:: too much; about most people and my cats... and the fish, too I feel alone:: even while immersed in crowds, sometimes I listen:: when I don't have a badhead (headache) I hide:: my unopened shaving gel (my sister takes it) I know:: a few languages I need to know:: whether I have to take the TOEFL or not... lots of other things would be helpful, too I wonder:: whether there will come a day I'll understand I give:: coffee and as much support as I can offer I feel:: in pain; my back hurts last cigarette: I've never had one and don't really want to ever have one... yuck last kiss: does my stuffed bunny count? last good kiss: n/a last good cry: no cries are really good, come to think of it... I cried a storm when I got in the wreck, so maybe that'd be it... but perhaps the most releasing crying session came on the last day before spring break this past school year last library book checked out: uhm, I think  Cracking the AP Chemistry Exam  by the Princeton Review... last movie seen: on video,  The Truman Show ; in theaters,  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (excellent, go watch it!)  last cuss word uttered: I've been pretty good about breaking the cursing mode I'd been getting into, but I called myself a "f---ing moron" many times after the wreck Last food consumed: a few cookies with coffee  last phone call: The Hair Salon to remind me of my appointment tomorrow... before that, Heather last tv show watched: likely either  Just Shoot Me  or  Mad About You  last cd played: Jimmy Eat World -  Jimmy Eat World  last soda drank: uhm... a Coke, I think last word spoken: "Give me your laundry. It's either now or never!" so "never" last amused: likely yesterday when I took my fan apart to figure out what was wrong with the light and when I put it back up and saw it didn't work daddy came by, pulled the string, and there was light... hehe... forgot about american fans doing that last time wanting to die: probably after the wreck  last time in love: "what's love got to do, got to do with it? What's love but a second hand emotion?" (Tina) last time hugged: I hugged mom because I was so excited about the trip. It was a thank you for sending me. last shirt worn: well if you count what I slept in, it was some white undershirt/tank top...really comfy; otherwise, an oversized Converse College comfy t-shirt because I was home last time dancing: I dance around all the time even though I can't dance. If you mean clubbing, I can't do that yet. And if you mean party... ehhh... a few months ago! current clothes: my pj shorts with cats on them and a Centre of the Performing and Visual Arts t-shirt... yeah, I'll go shower and get crap done soon... promise... current mood:: lazy current music: The Postal Service  Current Song : "Nothing Better" current taste: coffee current hair: reaaaaaaally long... and I got out of bed a few hours ago and never did brush it yet... it gets cut tomorrow, so I'm spending my last hours with it down! current annoyance: having to miss the 311 concert and Clint's graduation current smell: uhm. nothing really... I'm just sitting here. current thing I should be doing: cleaning/running errands/making phone calls/such current refreshment: V8 (I love this stuff! Poo on all ye people who think it's gross... mmm... tomatoes!) current worry: AP English-- getting those boring books read, college, getting in, getting scholarships, such stuff Would you ever date someone younger than you?: well, I'm at an age in which it's not really easy to find anyone decently mature at my own age, so, right now, probably not... maybe when I'm 25, but even then, I tend to always like older guys for one reason or another (not that much older though, 4 years is my uber limit... honest!) Ever been drunk? not quite... more like buzzed. Only twice. With my parents. On New Year's... at home. Been in love? infatuation- most definitely; love- I don't really know  Loved someone who you knew you couldn't have? I probably thought there was a chance if I even bothere, so likely not Broken a bone? more than one... I'm me. Of course I've messed up joints and broken bones! Had your heart broken? something like that, maybe not quite that Last time you said I love you to someone: hmmm... last night? Last time you laughed: likely earlier today. I laugh a lot. What age do you see yourself married at? that's waaaaay not something I'm really thinking about currently... let's get into college and graduate from there, too, first-- how about that? Do you sleep with a stuffed animal? of course How many homes have you lived in total? something around 10, I'm not going to start counting One pillow or two? two Do you get along with your parents? not really. Daddy isn't easy to communicate with anymore since the stroke although we used to be very close, and mom and I just can't get along if we're together for more than an entired day. We've been getting along okay, though, because I try to distance myself when I feel it's time to do so Whats your favorite color(s)? blue Do you work? I'd like to, but no-- I don't have a job, that is; I work a lot on stuff usually, though. Whats your favorite food(s): I love it all!! (save for very few things) Do you have braces? not anymo-ore!!! Mwahahahhaha!! I have nice, braceless teeth now! Going on 5 months!! *smiles* HAVE YOU EVER: Kissed your cousin: ew. no.   Ran away: no- snuck out to go to rehearsal, once... Broken someone's heart: probably so Cried when someone died: yes Wanted someone you knew you couldn't have: perhaps, but not too seriously Lied: yes. Everyone has. Cried in school: quite a few times-- in actual CLASS, the only two instances I can recall are that test over complex division in second grade and then the time B made me cry this year WHICH IS BETTER Coke or Pepsi: Coca Cola!  Sprite or 7UP: hmm.. tough... I like them both Girls or Guys: well, because I'm straight, I like guys, but then most of them turn out to be jerks anyway, so my trust for them is already nearly worn thin and tends to lie in a few close girl friends who can understand a lot better Flowers or candy: candy is a bad thing on so many levels, but I like it. Some flowers are good! Let's go with flowers. Honeysuckles, any one?  Scruff or Clean shaved: it really depends on the guy; some look good one way, some the other Tall or Short: I wish I were a little taller, so tall Pants or Shorts: pants THE LAST TIME: Showered: 4 am (yeah, I know... but I had to get some stuff done and play some Final Fantasy!) WHAT IS (your favorite):  Person You Hate Most: I don't really hate anyone; I dislike some people severely, but I don't hate them.  Movie:  Yellow Submarine  Ice Cream: depends on the country Season: again, depends on the country (and state) Breakfast Food: coffee...  WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON... You touched?: probably Ale, to get her attention or something to that extent You talked to?: my grandmother You kissed?: n/a Who broke your heart?: I plead the 5th here Who told you they loved you?: likely Heather

      I may not remember everyhing I pondered over last night, but this is one thing I recall...   Why do we wish for a normal life? I realized that, many a time, I have wanted nothing more than a normal life. I have complained because my life was so different from what everyone else's seemed to be, and I have wanted to be just like them. I have felt bad for having a completely odd and twisted story to tell that may get uncanny looks thrown at me, and I always seem to have a completely odd and twisted story for anything worth telling...  Why?!  A conversation with my sister and a good look in the mirror helped me remember that, fundamentally, diversity is what makes me me. And, after that occurrance, I am very glad that my nose was broken ten years ago and never quite returned to looking straight and that I don't often look like a photocopy of someone else... that I have oversized ex-soccer player legs and four cheeks when I smile, and, more importantly, that I cannot match my life to any book that's been written (that I have read thus far, anyway, technically), or that I can't relate to most stories published on Seventeen magazine and such others...   This is what it means to be different.

      Ahhh, the joys that come along with last-minute planning for a trip across the globe.  Well, if you didn't already hear me complain about it, I'm pretty irritated with my mother. She had told me the paperwork was done and sent off when it wasn't, and, as if lying to me weren't bad enough, no flight was scheduled and paperwork just got back. Now the finding a flight part.  They're all expensive, and they're all unclear. We seem to have found a pretty decent deal for more than a ticket should cost anyway, and now there is the issue that it is unsure whether it's a direct flight or not. I'm scared. I really hope this turns out to be a direct flight, because if not, I may very well get myself lost somewhere in the world...  There was, of course, the option of the body pass that my Aunt Juliana decided to throw in there last week; as she works for Delta, she offered daddy and I body passes. Now, while that isn't an issue for getting up there, the getting back is a real issue because we may very well get stuck in Rome, which would NOT be a good thing. Mind you, I'm only seventeen and this is my first time going across the globe on my own (daddy's mind can't help me). Actually, it's my first time flying on my own. Now, should I get stuck in rome, I could probably manage to find me a hotel and be all right in one way or another, but then there's daddy, and that complicates things more than you could even begin to imagine.  So, now I'm a bit frustrated, because I may very well be leaving exactly one week from today (next Tuesday) and be coming back 2 days before the beginning of school (school starts the 6th, I come back the 3rd), which is frightful in the sense that I will be exhausted, and just CRAP. AGHH!    Oh, and don't forget the family drama, of course. It is a long story that I shan't recount in detail on here, but what it all boils down to is that my mother hates my dad's family, and they hate her. Not only that, but also my aunt and uncle have their share of land and share daddy's share between them (farm land that there is profit off from), which, although we were always able to go without, is still unfair and all that jazz. Oh, and they're also battling over my family's house in the south, which is extra land, so of course they'd want that too (although that's a lot harder to snitch). So, all throughout my vacation, I will have to vigilate and make sure that they don't somehow convince daddy to sign anything that allows them to completely hoard whatever is there. And, although they love me, I know they very well may do that because even if I love them back, they are greedy people.    All I wanted was a break from this and a relaxing trip home. Is that really all that much to ask for!?!!?!?!?   EDIT: FUCK!!! They're bought. Atlanta-Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Rome. TO GET THERE. And to COME BACK: Rome-Cincinnati, Cincinnati-Atlanta... *cries* I'm gonna dieeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is sooooo nooooooooot faaaaaaaair!!! I'm so scaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaared!!!   Please pray for me. I mean, like really. I have NO earthly idea how I'm going to do this. I get lost IN Newnan...

       Current mood:  confuzzled  Currently listening to:  Tupac & Dr. Dre - "California Love"  I feel old just listening to this song. It's catchy, though... who could forget it?! *Jams out*  Hmmm... the past few days have been absurdly fun and fairly exuberantly recreational but relatively physically and cerebrally exigent (w00t for the proverbial cup!!). For essentially half the weekend I, so to say, congregated with a Coty for the first time in aboot a year, or something to that extent anyway. It was generally her first appearance in this home, and the first time in likely three-or-a-decent-enough-such-estimate years that she had been yonder over--here anyhow... 'twas fun. I nearly cannot believe we're seniors. Coty and I used to be inseparable at age 11-- she was fundamentally my first actual friend when I scoowampled to move to the USA, and I find it amazing that, out of all the folk I befriended back then, she is still in contact and good rapports with me. The fellowship of the long-haired foreign-or-close-enough two (soon-to-be long-haired one, however) actually managed to survive and maintain itself decently afloat to this day. I hope we'll be able to keep in touch throughout college as well although I know that she has no intention whatsoever to attend either of my potential scholastic choices.   Any-with-a-how, 'twas fun. I still ache from excess swimming and kids' toy expropriation missions that we effected at her house. We're talking five consecutive hours of unrelenting motion, kids... Fran here is getting a little too old to do that easily (I never thought it would come to this!).  Today we went bonkering--shopping, that is, and that was strictly amusing (figure it out). My mom did her share of nuisance for a while, obviously, but once she calmed down, all was better. I got some stuff... 's interesting. I'm not really one for hours and hours of shopping, so I'm really tired, but it was fun nonetheless, and I fit into some stuff I actually liked, which is nearly unheard of and yay.   Life right now is so sporadic, and I hardly have a clue of what's scoowampling to happen. There are very many things left to do before leaving, and, on top of that, I have no earthly idea exactly when I'm leaving yet!!! This is going to be interesting, to say the least. Be aware that, if I suddenly just depart from the continent and you knew nothing of it, it's no personal issue between the you and the I. I just may not get to telling you. So, yeah. That. Hmmm. I have to do a whoooooooooole lot of phone calls and laundry, I do know that fo' sho'. Loads to do! Hmmm, I may just go read a bit more of that morbid Jane alien's story now... although the plot is truly agonizing to read. I will give Bronte props for writing intriguingly enough to keep me awake (I even have to look up a word here and there, and I actually find that a good thing ---I'm foreign).  Oh, and I do believe I'll have a poodle cat sometime really soon (very likely this week). Shall snap a photo if I get a chance. ^.^

       Current mood:  apprehensive (in all meanings of the word)  Currently listening to:  Fool's Garden - "Lemon Tree"  The prior post was about the fact that I'm an idiot, that I'm human, and that I "screwed up". I let down my guard, acted like the idiot I can at times be, and made a mistake. The mistake wasn't as tragic as I likely make it out to sound in the sense that no one was harmed, and repairing my mistake will not be catastrophic. I am fortunate because I have the opportunity to get away with it; my mother actually does not have to know what happened. This saves my head... literally. Perhaps, she wouldn't physically tear off my head as I fear she would, but rest assured that I would likely be grounded until age 27.   The truth is that I am still immature and have more growing up left to do than I ever could have imagined. This is kicking in today, and, even though I wish I had never been such an imbecile, I am glad that this incident helped me realize how irresponsible I really am. I had instituted a form of idea in my head that I was a fairly responsible and mature person; why I allowed this thinking, I don't know, but the truth is that I really am not very much either one of those things.  Surely, things could be very much worse, and I could be a horrible person on so many levels. I am not. Nonetheless, now I realize that althought it is acceptable to be a disastering tornado, I should really guard against... well, myself. Although I am often told that I worry too much and am too alert about some things, I do need to worry that much because I am me. Although that sounds terrible, it is not so bad. It just means that I have to pay close attention, which is something that I obviously don't always do. I am ingrateful for so many good things that happen to me, and I suddenly realize that, too. I suddenly realize how easily I am able to get off the hook when I make mistakes and how little responsibility I really have to deal with.   I'm almost seventeen-- so young, and yet approaching adulthood. Rather, supposedly approaching adulthood. So, maybe it's time to appreciate utter deflation, and I think I do.   Eh. "Every little thing is gonna be all right," me thinks... in time-- all in due time. There goes another chapter in the book, and there goes its end, although it was a really helpful chapter in the long run.

So I guess screwing up is the most practical way to grow up, eh?   The best thing God ever gave me are people that love me so much... sincerely love me so much...

       Current mood:  exhausted  Currently listening to:  Jimmy Eat World - "Hear You Me"   I've been in cleaning frenzy mode all day, and I'm right down tired. I WILL start re-puzzling my room together, though! I also need to get back online later and go frame-hunting... does anyone know a good place to get simple frames for good prices? Also need to book hunt... I've yet to buy 3 of my AP books. I'm trying to shop very cheaply, as I will have to buy twenty or so more books throughout the year, and I'd really rather not spend $1000 on an AP class that I don't really sincerely want to take anyway. I really need to start reading, too... I only have a month and a half to read all five, and I'm sure that, once I'm out of the country, I'll be happily busy since I've been happily and unhappily busy even while stuck on this continent. There just aren't enough hours in a day! I say we move to a 48-hour day; I'd really need that. This is when the power reading course I never did get through would come in handy... wish me luck.  Side-notely, wow! I hadn't realized just how much hair mousse, hair spray, hair gel, and makeup I had left over from my legendary years of marching band (colorguard, if you didn't know). I threw most of it away as I am no longer required to transform my head to rock with the aforementioned chemical-infested liquids/semi-liquids so as to keep the hair in place while jumping around madly nor to mask myself as a clown with makeup to create a dramatic effect from the field!!! I'll give the experience credit for teaching me how to do all sorts of relatively difficult makeup including eyeliner, and, even better, how to do makeup well on a moving vehicle in the dark (Kim can even testify!)!!   And that, my friends, is definitely a part of the deal I do   not   miss.

       Current mood:  decently rested  Currently listening to:  Joni Mitchell - "Send in the Clowns"   I'm back in my rooooooooom!!! I am so happy!!! I have my hiding place again!!! Besides, it's a wonderfully deep blue, and I'm happy with the colour (which was what I originally wanted anyway before my mom had to come stick her nose in my business). My mom has been getting on my nerves in many ways-- mainly the fact that all I asked for was a new bookcase and love my room the way it is otherwise but she wants to do everything else to my poor room. Egh.   I'm feeling pretty good, but my voice is super funkifying. It's all blah. One can tell I haven't done any singing in a month... bleh!   Lastly, but absolutely not leastly, Shah peed on my English Bible-- the one I use most often in English. I don't know whether to throw it away. It's a good thing it wasn't my dearest Italian Bible that was given to me when I left, though, or else I'd have grey fur for sale!

       Current mood:  pleased  Currently listening to:  All State (Men's and Women's choirs)recording    All State CD arrived today! Because I never did produce an account of the experience nor the Nelsonisms I promised the choir cronies I'd post a while ago, here we go.(Hinkle might be the only one who can make it through this entire post-- bear with me if you dare! No penalty if you can't.)    Sector A: All State Commentary    (N.B.: Being a dedicated alto, I am unequivocally inadvertently slightly biased and tend to prefer altos and basses...sorry for any who might care or take these things to heart?)   Women's Choir:     urlLink       It has a nice sense of style and pretty good diction. 'Tisn't very exciting, however. Not as exciting as it had felt on stage and at rehearsals, that is. Great accents. Overall a good job; it's disappointing not to be able to hear very well the faux male opera man section that the Altos had the honor to sing *sigh*... excessive Soprano there with too high a note in contrast... thanks a lot for stealing our scene, Sops! (Just kidding... kinda.) Good final consonants mostly.    urlLink       All right, all right-- it is an extremely challenging piece; therefore, harshness is uncalled for. Nearly every part in "The World is Full of Poetry" seems to be written for Soprano I, and this problem is reflected in the bit of struggle and tension that is heard in the Alto parts throughout the splendid composition. Even soprano II's and I's have trouble spots here and there. GOOD dynamics... too bad that the diction is almost bad and we sound like Giogia peaches. "Braht-ness"?? *sighs* Super props to Jon Marc, our pianist... if there is someone that put feeling into this one, it is he we speak of. Overall all right, I suppose. I think we could have done a better job with this wonderfully light piece had we had more time to perfect it and more people who cared about diction (this isn't to say that the diction should have been stern at all). Essentially, we didn't sing the piece simply enough; it is, indeed, a passage that is to be sung very simply and harmoniously and heart-felteadly, and something similar is what the composer had told us in his notes, anyway.     urlLink       First measure: WOW. Very enchanting... one gets lost in time. The diction is pretty good for a choir of mostly American senior girls; it is actually really good, mostly. Alto-- YAY! The powerful mezzo forte intended for the Alto solo really turned out to be what it was supposed to turn out to be. Altos rock. Overall, very nice. The performance overall brought out the splendor of this prayer, which was pretty well reflected in the voices.     urlLink      Okay, I really liked this one... Really really. A lot. It was my favourite piece, so minimal bashing follows. Very, very nice dynamics, good pitch-- props to sops, those were some woah loud and high 'doh's. Altos unfortunately don't have a very good unison in this one. DICTION!!! Ahhh, man... it still kicked butt, but this would have been not just da bomb, but an atomic bomb had we not gotten so lost in the playfulness of the piece and minded diction more. Some parts sound like a single vowel and some consonants are unheard. Some sound childish--think east-and-west singing going on here and there. Overall, W00t!!!    urlLink       Horizontal singing--bad, bad, bad, but not very terribly. This was supposed to be a very stricly, vertically dark piece. Good consonants, and great dynamics and slides. The ending-- wow. Sopranos did a wonderful job with a very dark and strong tone on the first round of the finale. I found it a pretty hard ending, as, if you don't know, it is a series of rounds separated by single rests at a 104 (per quarter) tempo-- which can get pretty darn confusing as it is definitely almost impossible to get back in once one's out. Overall, very nice. The audience agreed.     urlLink       My mom told me this was our worst one, and, as I often say, she doesn't understand anything. Beautiful... it was by far the deepest, and one can hear how heart-felt the song is without any trouble. The problem (which causes the song not to be our best)? DICTION!!! Just because it's Georgia All-State choir, it should NOT sound like it. Gah. "Lahst"... "Blahnd"... "Ah"... so forth. Whatever happened to inward singing, in some sections? Nonetheless, even though the bad diction does subtract from the majesty of the piece, it is still very moving... very much so. *Sheds a tear*    urlLink       Go Altos!!!! Pretty good diction, but it could be better. Nice mature sound throughout... All discordant clashes sound wonderful. Good dynamics-- they make the piece very exciting.  Great  ending. Optimal final slide. Nonetheless, I thought it would be better.    Men's Choir:   8. "Listen to a Jubilant Song"--Pretty nice. Good harmonies-- one can hear every part distinctly. Diction is all right but could be better... I can understand what Hinkle meant when he said the whole thing was a competition to see who had the most developed hormones. Overall, nice.  9. "El Yivneh Hagalil"-- one word: w00t!!! This one is mighty wondrously intriguing and well sung. Excellent dynamics and tempo change from double to single. Overall, I love it!  10. "Swing Down Chariot"-- overall nice, but it's a bit rushed, and lots of consonants are therefore accidentally cut off/ just dropped there. Good vowels, though. I must admit I don't really like the song, too. We had to sing a similar arrangement with K Bizzle (Ms. B), and she forced it upon us, and it sucked very badly and everyone pretty much loathed the song after that.   11. "When I Hear Her"-- *cries* I nearly cried/melted at the concert... just wow. Very expressive, stupendous, and emotional, and just wow... sing it to me? *cries some more*  12. "Send in the Clowns"-- beautiful. Great consonants and good vowel diction. This piece is very employing both for the listener and the performer. Tenors, watch brightness. Likely my favourite, along with, of course, "When I Hear Her"... great job, guys.  13. "The Awakening"-- What an exceptional and phenomenal composition. Another wow for that. Props for the director for putting this on the repertoire. Good performance, and special props to Mr. Anderson, the accompanist.     Sector B: All State Accounts     Well, this was a while ago, but overall, I learned a whole lot. Aside from the initial trouble I was given for having learned the wrong (but vocally appropriate for me) part, once that was settled, it was a rather enjoyable experience (save for having to deal with the few that retained impressing everyone more important than making music together, but I guess those are everywhere. There was a competition on who could slide more in "Three Ways..." between Molly (the girl who sat beside me) and I, though, and that was actually pretty fun). Dr. Nelson, the conductor, was amazing. He taught me a lot about different modes of singing and that silence can be so beautiful. He also taught me that talent is nearly nothing compared to imagination.  All State gave me a great opportunity to get to know the people I went with a lot better. I'm on good terms with all of them now-- even Grayson, whom I had previously thought unbelievably obnoxious and disrespectful ofeveryone- it turns out that he does  behave decently or even well when he really tries, and he does try, as unbelievable as that seems. I am very glad that I went with the group I went with and would have had it no other way-- I hope we all make it again next year, guys. Savannah is fun and beautiful, but I guess you already know that, particularly if you know that it is my favourite US city. Good food... mmm... good ice cream... mmm... good coffee... mmmm...     Sector C: Nelsonisms     urlLink       Unfortunately, I didn't record any of our rehearsals and am not a computer, so I don't remember every little Nelsonism there is, but here are some highlights that I wrote down out of amusement.  1. "How many of you want to go doo doo? *thoughtful pause* I did NOT just say that." (during "Three Ways...") 2. "It's nuclear fusion... no, wait, fission... no, wait... what's the difference again? Mah, it's nnnnn--uclear ... SQUEEEOOSHION!!! *super exploding hand motion*"(discussing dynamics and blend of the last 6 measures of "Go Where...") 3. "Give them a gift." (what we should do for the listeners) 4. "LET ME DRIVE!!! *whimper*" (for all the times we got ahead of him) 5. "It's a schwab, that's what it is!" (describing the sound for the hybridization of two other sounds) 6. "I want legatissimissimissimissimissimissimissimissimissimissimo (How many misses was that?)" (self explanatory) 7. "Stop time." (giving directions for "Salve Regina", first measure) 8. "Bad flat. Flat bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad flat. Bad flat. Flat bad. BAD FLAT!!" (Flats are bad if they're not intended to be there) 9. "You're being petulant... you're not ticked at her!!" (explaining that "Salve Regina" is a prayer for mercy and should therefore be gentle and full of piety) 10. *makes duck-mouth hands and starts flapping them toward one another in the middle of the piano intermission for "The World...". The pianist stops and looks at him* "What?! We're conversing!! Keep playing!!" (Dr. Nelson's hands and the choir conversing?) 11. *Reenacts housewife vacuuming* "I wish we could do this at the performance while singing... if we only had the space..." (during "Three Ways..") 12. "Be UNREASONABLY emotional!" 13. "Be stupid... be an idiot." (describing how we should sing the "ah"s at the end of "Three Ways...") 14. "Get lost." (referring to what we should do with the depth of "Amazing Grace") 15. "ALTOS ROCK!!!!" (obviously, we do. If the best agree, then hey...) 16. "Talent is not what matters. The key is imagination... you can have as much talent as you want, but if you don't do anything with it and it's nothing but God-given talent, there's nearly nothing."  He gave us a final speech that was very deep. I hope to work with him again.    Okay... I'm done now. *hears and sees nothing but crickets*

       Current mood:  idle  Currently listening to : Aha - "Take on Me"  I had to move the hair appointment to two weeks and a day later than it was supposed to be. I was supposed to have it cut this Thursday, but something came up in mom's schedule, so I rescheduled both of our appointments. I'm kind of happy because I was starting to be in a bit of a freak-out stage regarding the loss of inches and inches of hair. Phew. Now I have a bit of extra time with my hair! W00t!  Egh. There are some real jerks and morons out on the web. DA is turning rotten what with morons posting practically porno and calling it art. All the snapshots are are simple Kodak film with naked poses. The photos fit the definition of porn, and I don't understand how DA can allow that kind of crap to be posted on an art community. Although I'm not a very active member and have only posted a few pieces of crap from a long time ago, it still bothers me. But a year ago, that kind of stuff wasn't going on on there.   Then, there was this other feller on lj that completely bashed Christianity. He went off on a terribly harsh criticizing rant and concluded it with, "I'm not bashing" when that's all he ever did. Even the title was a call for an argument-- "Attention so-called Christians..." Many people commented, and I think I and maybe one other person were the only ones to stand up for what we believed in. I wasn't picking a fight, but I was very deeply offended. I'm not the perfect Christian and I falter a lot, but I still think He does at least exist. Even if I haven't communicated with God in a long time and am at weird odds with Him right now, I still thought the feller was very harsh and incoherent. Half of what he said doesn't make sense. I felt like his reply to my comments was mean as well, and all my comments did were stir up more trouble. So, I left a final comment and said I wouldn't be checking back for his answer.   He is an atheist and formed an online community called the church of something. It's like a forum for Christianity because he thinks it's stupid that different religions of Christianity disagree. Well, guess what, dude? Man always disagrees. And for another point, Christianity isn't religion, but a way of life. I told him so, but I'm sure he's so dense it went nowhere.   I know that everyone screws up, but man, hardly anyone remembers that Christianity is based on love. Everyone seems to relate it to an attempt to escape death, a way not to be damned for eternity. I admit that I've been scared, too, and sometimes I've forced myself back in there for fear of what is to come, but that's why I'm taking time off of church to ponder, partly. I don't want it to be like that. I want to find a good place to worship with communion with other people who aren't afraid or seeking power in the church. I know that that has to start with me, though. I never wanted my relationship with God to be based around fear; just love.   I've probably gone off into a completely different rant by now. Sorry if I confused you, but I suppose that, even though this entry should have gone in my handwritten, private journal, typing did make it a lot faster to get my thought out.

       Current mood:  highly annoyed  Currently listening to:  Garbage - "When I Grow Up"  I'm annoyed with today. Actually, I'm kind of ticked off at today.  Actually, it all started with a lack of sleep. I went to bed (or, rather, to couch) at 11.30 pm because I thought I'd get some sleep before the darned beast (SAT). Yeah, RIGHT! I miss my room terribly. The paint job just needs to get done and be over with... There is NO privacy in this darned house outside of my room. I was on the brink of slumber, that calm feeling of utter drugless ecstasy one reaches, when my dad came flip-flopping into the kitchen although I'd priorly explained the issue to him and asked him not to do so. "Whoops, I didn't realize..." MRAH!! Sometimes I get so incredibly frustrated with him. I understand that he can't help the matter most of the time, but it's still annoying, and he never leaves me alone when I'm at home (i.e., if I'm locked in my room, he will knock until I am forced to come out because I can no longer withstand the thunderous "bang, bang, bang" that is easily innerving).   Then, my mom came in to go to the kitchen while speaking obnoxiously loudly. She, too, had forgotten. She moved downstairs and spoke just as loudly to my grandmother, likely thinking she wouldn't be heard. Well, WRONG! Then, my grandmother came to the kitchen and commenced cleaning dishes. On her journey up the stairs, she carried on this annoying thing she regularly does; it's a bit of a song-whisper-whistle, but, trust me, it is HIGHLY annoying. So, by this point pissed and by this point the hour being 1:20 am, I asked her to just clean the dishes in the morning. This lead to one of her rants about how she doesn't have rights to do anything and that I have no respect for her, which just made things worse. I fell asleep about 2:00 am or so and literally jumped when the alarm clock went off at 6:00 am.  I had a good breakfast consisting of eggs, bacon, cheese, fruit, and coffee, and I prepared it myself, without *gasp* burning anything. This was more than likely the highlight of my day.   Needless to say, the SAT was pure crap. The experimental section that they tossed in my test was a math one, as there was an extra math. Of the three 30-minute sessions, there was one that I was pretty positive I gained most points possible on, but I bet you that that was the experimental section. Just watch it happen. The whole test was pretty yucky, as I found a few possible tricks within some math questions and couldn't decide on a few which trick not to fall for--not to mention the fact that I didn't even GET to a total of about 6 or 7 math questions out of the whole test.   The verbal kicked my butt. This was mainly the readings' fault. Only one of them was enjoyable and coherent. The rest were a large mass of crap slapped together. One passage regarding DaVinci contradicted itself, every other sentence. The author would claim DaVinci a genius in one sentence and an idiot in the next, and I'm not exaggerating. It was confusing, and, lo and behold, 10 questions out of the 30 in the section covered this passage only. Once again, I didn't even get to 5 or 6 or 7 or maybe even 8 of the verbal questions. Yeah. I don't think it's worth canceling the score over because my last chance to take the SAT will be in October, which is the next test date. Therefore, I might as well see how this one went. There's really not much to lose but thirty dollars (if I canceled, that is). Grah.  Home. Daddy annoys me. House is a mess and I can't really do anything much about it until I can return the contents of my room TO my room. Grandma annoys me. Ale annoys me. I check my inbox and discover that Kathryn, a student whose email was given to me by Mrs. Smith, her AP Chemistry teacher from two years ago (and mine this year, if you didn't know) has replied. Mrs. Smith had noted several congruities between our intentions for college and thought it'd be appropriate that I communicate with Kathryn and hear (or, well, read) what she had to say/advise. So, I emailed her. She responded that, first of all, I was mistaken regarding the possibility of a music minor at State. I could have sworn I read there was a music minor, but she revealed to me that she had attempted to do the same but had been told that all possibilities with that included but a music major.   She did, however, tell me a bit about Music at Tech. They do presently offer a minor, which is new, and they like to entwine scientific views and musical, which is, quoting Kathryn, the "Techy" way to approach it. She did say that it was a pretty good program regardless of what many said and that Tech is working on obtaining a major in music program. She advised that I not do the dual enrollment, as music at State is tougher than it seems in the sense that very much time, even in a minor, has to be invested in music (an original thought of mine confirmed). She doesn't think anyone'd be able to handle such a task in concurrence with GA Tech's Nuclear Engineering major, and I understand what she means as I had kind of been fooling myself into believing that will can get anyone as far as he/she wants to go.   So, I'm yet again puzzled over what to do. My mother is of no help, as always, and simply thinks I should just join a choir and leave it at that. She just doesn't get it.   I figured I could cheer myself up with some coffee and Noir; I had burnt a few episodes on CD and, for some reason, this stupid computer has ceased to want to play videos from file. Winamp video works online, but I can't get it to go back to the default settings that allow it to play video files. I am almost positive that this was accidental action of my mother, as she doesn't know how to handle computers, makes messes, and later washes her hands clean of the issue by claiming I did it and must fix it. *Sigh*  Anyway, I watched Noir on the Ghettomachine, where it worked perfectly, which tells me that there is, indeed, something wrong with video on this computer. Grah. I don't feel like dealing with that right now.   I think I will go waste away and complete a few other useless actions somewhere else in this messy, horrendously messy, home.

       Current mood:  mildly pissed  Currently listening to:  the sound of the air conditioner  I just got in a huge argument with my sister. When things like these happen between the two of us, exceedingly venomous things always seem to come out, and today the traditional- if not worse- moral-bashing occurred.  This seems to be happening a lot lately; as odd as this may sound, I really do think that it's time for her to move out and the two of us to part ways for a while. Sometimes I wonder whether it could be possible that there ever exist a feud so huge between us that we may not speak to one another for months or years or decades. It's kind of frightful how I can imagine that happening.  I love my sister, mind you, but what she said today hurt because it was true, and the truth hurts. I, of course, returned the favour. Pointing out each other's weaknesses to this extent makes it worthy of description involving "fire", "missiles", and "severe, disgusting wounds"...   Nonetheless, she verbally confirmed some things I've been thinking about and fearing, so that's sort of yucky. I wonder whether I did the same for her.  We almost always fight so badly the day before any important exams of mine... coincidence? Well, one question's answered: where will I sleep tonight? Not on the floor in my sister's room. That leaves the couch or a pain-in-the-bum transportation of the bed to somewhere else. We'll see.

       Current mood:  amused  Currently listening to:  Modest Mouse - "Float On"     I Am A:  Neutral Good Elf Bard Ranger    Alignment:   Neutral Good  characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.    Race:   Elves  are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.    Primary Class:   Bards  are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.    Secondary Class:   Rangers  are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.    Deity:   Oghma  is the Neutral Good god of knowledge and invention. He is also known as the Binder of What is Known, and is the Patron of Bards. His followers believe that knowledge reigns supreme, and is the basis for everything else that is done. They wear white shirts and pants, with a black and gold braided vest, and a small, box-like hat. All priests of Oghma are known as Loremasters. Oghma's symbol is a scroll.

       Current mood:  worn out  Currently listening to:  Coldplay - "Crests of Waves"   Paint infests my room, myself, and parts of the house accidentally.   We've finally come around to buying the paint to paint my room (the original idea was to do it last year), so I've been painting. My mother has been the other party in the process, and my sister helped for five minutes and then scoowampled out of the deal, the sucker.   Anyway, it's been pretty fun. We've got one more coat to go, and that will be applied tomorrow morning. The primer took a good 6-7 hours to apply yesterday, and the room actually looked good simply after that application (because the blue we're painting is rather deep, we needed a primer that was 50% the actual colour-- in our case, a pretty, lively smurf blue). The first coat of the actual planetarium blue isn't very nice, but hopefully once it dries better and the second coat, which will be easier to  handle, will be over it, it will look good.   I'm generally giving my room a gradual makeover, me thinks, and the room's excited.    I tried to talk my mom into utilizing the storage room besides the garage to build a laboratory, but she doesn't like the idea. It was originally supposed to be an art studio, but Alessandra is moving out for good, I think, so it'd be useless to convert it to an actual art studio at this point. I really did want a lab, but my mom believes I'd blow up the house, for some odd reason. Eh. I guess I'll have to wait until I own my own home to build me a laboratory. It will be fun-- I can invite friends over to play!  Anyway, SAT: Decent Score Attempt Mission #2 is Saturday. I haven't studied a single bit, and I just realized that I don't have a graphing calculator anymore as I'm no longer in Calculus thanks to summer vacation (yay for Christmas/barfday gifts, even if they don't help me much right this very now), so I've already got bad feelings about it. *Sigh* I hate this stupid test. It's but a test over how well or badly one can take the darned thing, and I just happen to be a decent but not great SAT taker. I may be in advanced mathematics courses of all sorts and have a fairly good vocabulary, but I'm just not good at taking this test. Although my first score wasn't very great, it was almost decent and good enough to get me into both Tech and Mercer, I do believe. My issue and focus currently is obtaining scholarships. Hopefully, I'll still be okay if I don't do well on the SAT again. I have nearly everything else scholarship donors like to aid me, so maybe they'll like me anyway! Eh... They say it's very rare for SAT scores to jump dramatically from one try to another, but I guess I really haven't much of a choice but to give it a shot.   If you pray and if you love me, you know what to do. ^.^  Anyhow, my next rant includes how much I want to leave the country and graduate. Italy paperwork is still undergoing processes at the Consulate, but hopefully I'll still be able to get some decent amount of time in vacation *super-knock on wood*. Otherwise, I can't believe there's a year of high school left. UGHH.   Well, wow, I came, I typed, I ranted.  Oh, yeah, I really need to get crap done this month. Adios for now!

       Howdy yo. This is obviously me. I figured that I hadn't actually really typed much in here lately, so I might as well do so now. Well, first of all, I didn't feel like making a new template but wanted a change, so I'm sure you see that effectiveness taking place. My blogback comments don't count on here, so comment and pretend to like me if you don't. Secondly, school started again, and I am beginning to return to misery again.      Today was ignore-Francesca day. And then eventually yell at Francesca day. But I'm okay.       The AP English work load is already looking evil, and economy is retarded and evil. This will be fun. But I'll just keep trying to think that this will be a good year, for it has potential to be a good year.     I went to the cardiologist the other day, and he told me I should start drinking less coffee so as to improve my chances of escaping the plague that is high blood pressure that runs through my family. I have been needing coffee lately-- not for pleasure, but to stay awake. We'll see how this will turn out.      I think that's really all I have to type on here, really actually. Miscellaneous stuff has been going on, and Ale's moved out. Randomness every where. Eh. Such is life. It happens. Stuff happens, and I'm not sure why I find it oh-so-fascinating to keep track of nothing here.       The wind blows through and bellows and sings and all that fun jazz, and I'm not swept away in any literal nor figurative way. Maybe because there isn't much wind blowing, anyhow.

       Woy yoy yoy, what the crap happened to my webpage? Whatever that is, I'm not going to bother to fix it right at the now because I don't feel like it.       While I may have missed some people, I did not miss the States one bit. As a matter of fact, I cried my heart out as soon as we flew back into them. *Sigh*   Nonetheless, the past month was a dream and I was the happiest I have been in a very long time.       On the way from Germany to Italy I flew in a little plane, a nice 50-seater Alitalia Express. That was likely the best flight I have ever embarked on; I had a beautiful view of the Alps and various beaches and towns. The flight back was miserable because I did not by any means want to come back, but we did fly over Greenland and that was beautiful. I jotted down a description on the plane:     There isn't a cloud in the sky, so here is Greenland. Rather gorgeous stuff. Masses of mountains scattered like sharp and jagged pebbles in limpid waters with white icing and that dandruff that the sea has floating around. Icebergs are beautiful. It's about 4.40 there... we're halfway back, and oh-what-sorrow.         So there was Greenland.      The airport in Germany was terribly huge and I was mocked by some German jerks, but it all floated on okay. The airport in Cincinnati was tiny and I was treated like solid excrement by a rude bastard and then robbed by the intelligently deficient US Security services of my sausage (which was partly my fault because I wasn't bright enough to consider that the US would feel a threat at the knowledge that I was carrying some form of meat into their stupid country, but then again I was also exhausted and hadn't slept in two days).       There was a Via Amore in Santa Croce-- meaning Love Street. The earthquake of 2002 had greatly ruined it, far more than practically all other roads, and there were wooden trusses supporting whatever was left standing. One section of the road was outstandingly well, and there I heard a couple in a home carrying on a rather tempestuous fight. Let's just say I was disappointed.      I miss the place, I miss them all. However, it really was a wonderful month, and if circumstances don't want to completely and oh-so-rudely crack me open and suck my guts out and will actually allow me to return next summer, I will do so. I have some pictures, but unfortunately a lot didn't turn out any good.       I am tan, or decently so. I have learned a lot about my family and what I am made of, and I am a lot more like what my mother used to be than I ever knew. I am rather proud of that, and I am very proud of what I am, whatever that may be.       Lyndsey and mama agree that I have gained back my accent a little bit, and I am actually glad. Ahh.      Pics will be a mess, but I'll fix it later...
