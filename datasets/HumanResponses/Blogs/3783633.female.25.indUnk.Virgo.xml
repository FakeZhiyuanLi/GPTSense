       Something I do not like are the stupid McDonalds commercials (sorry MaScola). I don't understand what this whole "feed the rivalry" thing is. What, am I just supposed to see dirty White Sox fans playing mean tricks on Cubs fans and go, "Oh, hey... that reminds me, I want a Big Mac!" And why are the ones where the Cubs fan does something to a White Sox fan so lame? I'm sure the marketing exec. who came up with those commercials is a White Sox fan. It's pretty obvious. Joe had a good point about the Subway commercials. At least they're advertising Dusty and Ozzie's favorite subs, calling them Northsider and Southsider subs or something like that. That's creative. Go Subway! Now, McDonalds doesn't even have any special sandwiches or anything. Like we Cubs and Sox fans need anything more to fight about. Like we need to "feed the rivalry." Give me a break. I live with a White Sox fan, and that's bad enough. I don't need to see commercials about it. Hmmmm, that gives me an idea. I should put catpoop in her shoes or something worse, and tell her that the commercial told me to do it, then she could sue McDonalds for ruining her shoes or whatever else I destroy. Remember the coffee scandal?. Ha! I have come up with the perfect plan!!! Oh, the power of influence is strong. Hey, if people can sue fast food restaurants for making them fat... imagine what I could do with this!    urlLink

       So in addition to this nice public blog that I've started, I also have started a private online diary. It's private because I'm not going to share the location of it with anyone. However, there's something cool about having a diary that anyone can read, but no one knows it's me.  I got a call today from a school district in Waukegan. They want to meet me for an interview. I'm going to have to call them back and tell them that I've already found a job for the fall. I can't believe that schools wait all the way until almost July to start calling people for interviews. I sent my stuff to them so long ago. If I were still sitting here not knowing if I have a job or not, I'd go crazy. I'm so glad that is all over, and I'm happy with the job that I accepted.  Joe comes home tomorrow. I'm picking him up at the airport. It sounds like he's having a nice vacation, and that Jackie's move is going well. I miss him, though and I can't wait to see him. XOXO

       Okay. I like my instant messenger. However, I really only actually use it to talk to one person. Other than that, I don't actually talk to anyone over IM. Now, I do have a few people on my list, and that's cool. There's a little "knock knock" sound when they come online. Every once in a while they send me messages. I'm not complaining. However, I used to turn on the option where no one can send me an instant message unless they are on my buddy list. This is fine, of course, but then what if someone needs to send me a message and they aren't on my list? I guess they could email me, of course, but it's so fun to IM. Now the problem is that I turned off that option so every dork in the world who sees I'm online decides to send me a message. And I'm way to nice to not reply to them. I could just pretend that I'm not around... in the other room or something, but I have such a problem being blatantly rude to someone. Geez. Of course, I could go invisible, but then how will the people I want to know I'm on know I'm on? What a dilemma. So, whenever my computer is on, I've got my Yahoo! Messenger up and running. I like to be alerted when I get mail. It makes this crazy gunshot boi-oi-oing sound that I love. It startles Stacy. I love my instant messenger. I think everyone should have one. Then we could talk online all the time. So to all of you who don't have an instant messenger:  urlLink GET ONE!  Okay, as for the rest of my day, I did a whole lot of nothing. That's two days in a row, count em, peeps! Tomorrow I'll be calling the store to see what's up. Stacy and I also have to go over to the leasing office to resign. I'm sure I'll be stopping over at the 'rents' place too. I've gotta pick up all my paperwork for school. I'll be adding school dates to my calendar soon. Here's an idea that I was thinking of for all the girls. We should have a Sex & The City party. Everyone could come over once a month say on a Sunday, and we could watch a season at a time, drink wine or whatever, eat sandwiches, and the like. We could start doing that in say September (I know how crazy everybody's summer schedules are). Well anyway, let me know what you think.  Gwinny is sticking her whole paw into the watering can that has some water in it. She doesn't like to drink the water out of her water dish... she likes to get it everywhere else. Now she's sitting up on the breakfast bar watching Patty eat. My life is so exciting.XOXO

        Well, since I already started my other diary format, I'm not sure if I'm going to switch to this one or not. It is kinda neat, and since other people can comment, that's cool. However, I'm not really excited about changing the format on my site. I'll see how it goes. Let me know what you think.

       Joe left this morning for Boston. He's driving out with his sister. She got a job out there since her husband's band is relocating. He's the drummer in a band called  urlLink The Kissers.  They're an Irish rock band, so moving to Boston should greatly increase their popularity. They're a really fun band, and I suggest checking them out if they're ever in your area. Now, I didn't really see Jackie that often since she lived in Wisconsin, but I'm going to miss her. I'm sure I feel this way because she's going to be even further away now. But on the bright side... I'll have an excuse to take a trip out to Boston on long weekends! So needless to say, my Sunday was spent doing just about nothing. Joe has sent me updates everytime they enter a new state or stop for food or to use the facilities, culminating into the most exciting parts of my day. He'll be back Wednesday night. Yea! Stacy (roomie) brought home dinner from Ruby Tuesday. I had a cheeseburger. Yum. And that was my day.

       Today was a full day of family, friends, and fun! First, Joe and I went out to his cousin's new house for a housewarming party. Then we headed over to the Bloomingdale fest where we met up with Jamie and Naomi. We walked around for a little while, and the boys won Naomi and me stuffed animal flowers. I'll be putting mine in my classroom when the school year starts up. Then we headed over to where they had live music. The Cryin' Shames were playing tonight. We listened to "Sugar and Spice (and everything nice) and then took off. But not before Joe bought me a funnel cake. Those are the best part of summer and fests. Yummy. After the fest, we headed up to Cousins for some darts and drinks. The night ended with the four of us hanging out at Joe's apartment, listening to Dark Moor and chillin'.

       Here it is! These are the very first beginnings to my very first webpage. I'm so excited. Hopefully you'll be able to check out pics of my friends, my rockstar boyfriend, and my kitty-kat Guinevere soon. For now, you can check out my calendar so you can see what I'm up to. Then you can sign my guest map. I'm sure this site won't be global or anything, but I think it's cute. It's like a guestbook with visual aids. Have fun!!!

      I've been trying to work these two jobs as effortlessly as possible, but it's rough and I don't know how much anyone understands. I'm not asking for tons of sympathy or anything. I know there are millions of people out there who are working harder than I am every day. I just don't like it when people expect a lot out of me when they know that my heart's not in it. Obviously, my priority is the department store since I plan to keep that during the school year. I like the job a lot, it's one of the more fun jobs I've had. However, it is so draining. We all know that I hate cleaning my room, and this is pretty much the same thing. I'm constantly picking up clothes and hanging or folding them. Cleaning out fitting rooms is tons of fun too, let me tell you. Then there's the waiting. The standing and waiting is what really gets you. Hours will go by and not one person will walk through the section. It's agonizing trying to remember the reasons why I'm there. I just walk around and start straightening stuff, or look at the clothes and estimate how much I will be spending from my second paycheck once school starts. So by the time I get home, the bottoms of my feet are raw, my ankles are stiff, my calves are throbbing, my knees feel like bricks and my back is killing me. It takes me five minutes just to crack it. It's been a while since I've spent so much standing around time on my feet, and I'm still getting used to it. So cut me some slack. I know it's not the end of the world, but if I have a hard time getting up at seven to be at work by nine to alphabatize photo files, try to understand. It's just that it's taking me a little while to adjust to this whole job thing. I know what you're thinking... and you're right. I'm a princess. I'm a big, bratty, pink wearing, sparkly loving princess, and when it comes right down to it, I don't want to "work." I want to teach, which to me isn't work. I can't wait till the schoolyear starts! Last night I went over to Joe's where he worked on fixing Steve's computer and I worked on getting my Madonna album up. I have to give a shout out to Rich for giving me the info on creating a photo album. It's much appreciated. It makes everything cleaner and A LOT easier! Anyway, as much as I love Madonna, I don't want to look at those pictures for another year, at least. Unfortunately, by the time Joe and I were done with what we were working on, we didn't have any time left to work on the new stuff. I'm really excited about it. I asked Joe if I could help promote his next gig. I have tons of ideas, and I really want to get more people at his shows. I have concocted a whole slew of methods to get the band's name out there, and I will stop at nothing. Hopefully, I'll get to work with Tom on a lot of it, but when it comes to poundin' the pavement, word of mouth stuff, I'm all over it. So watch for it... The Storm is out there!

          This weekend we visited the  urlLink Bristol Renaissance Fair . Joe and I met up with Christine, John, Jayme, Tony, Mark and Amber at the fair around 2:30 p.m. We walked around, watched a joust, saw the Queen, talked to the ever knowlegdable lady at one of the armories, had dinner, and just goofed around. They guys fenced each other. Tony and John won their matches against Joe and Mark respectively. It was a really good time, and hopefully I'll have some pictures up on my website soon. I seem to keep saying that in all my posts, but I mean it. It'll happen. XOXO

            photo courtesy of   urlLink  Madonnalicious.com         Last night, I was blessed. I was fortunate enough (thanks to THE BEST MOM IN THE WORLD) to see the greatest show I have ever seen. I was in attendance at Madonna's third Chicago performance of her Reinvention tour. Stacy and I left at about 6:30 to head down to the United Center. On the way, we jammed in the car to a soundtrack of Madonna's Immaculate Collection and GHV2. We found parking easily, and maneuvered our way into the stadium with ease. Once inside, we stopped briefly at the souvenir stand, but they were out of the shirt I was interested in. They did have it in another color, but it was priced $20 more than on her website, so I decided that one day (when I have money) I will order it online at  urlLink Madonna.com . Once we found our seats, we patiently waited for the show to begin. About an hour later (with no opening act) the lights went out. On the two large screens were projected images from her photo shoot with Steven Klein that were featured in a 44 page portfolio in W magazine in April 2003. It's too bad that I couldn't understand the voice that was clearly Madonna's, accompanying the imagery. It was so loud, and the crowd was going crazy. The screens separated and settled at the sides of the stage, framing the large middle screen that would take on the role of a backdrop later in the show. Madonna emerged from the center of the stage. It rose up, creating a pedestal high above the stage. She proceeded to pose on the pedestal, on her head, with one knee bent. I can only assume that this is one of her yoga moves. It was fascinating. As the music started, and the "snaps" from the backup dancers began, it was clear. It was Vogue. The show went on, featuring hits from a career spanning more than 20 years. The show was fiery, vibrant, inspirational, and beautiful. It was spiritual and patriotic.&nbsp;From the pop hits to the ballads to the rock guitar, the pulses of the audience raced. She country line danced, played guitar, twirled around as if in a field of sunflowers and even did the tango. Madonna is by far my most treasured idol, and I can now say that I sang along with her songs. Sure, this is something I've done countless times in my 25 years, but never before in the same room. For that, I am blessed. Thanks Mom! XOXO   &nbsp;  I'll have more about this concert, including pictures, on my website soon, so check back!!!

      My goodness! It is only mid-afternoon, and I have so much to rant about! Let me start by explaining that I quit my last waitressing gig in January, after being told that a situation I had with a guest, "isn't worth getting an email over." This was said to me by a manager who refused to go to the table to straighten out a misunderstanding. This same manager was constantly talking about how he pleasured himself the night before, or what he likes to do to women when in the bedroom. Definitely not job talk. I guess at a restaurant anything goes, but I was fed up. So I quit. Well. Today, that manager's incompetence got my roommate fired. It is his job to check up on all tables that come into the restaurant. Instead, he was probably sitting in the office watching television. So when two women sent an email to complain about Stacy's service (she thought she had handled the situation) she was fired. If the manager had been out on the floor, checking on tables, they could have told him about it then and there and the situation could have been squelched. Can you believe she was fired over an email?!? She wasn't even allowed to explain her side of the story. The general manager said to her, "My day would be perfect if I didn't have to do this." I'm sure Stacy was glad that Jen has such a perfect life that nothing in the world is a worry unless she has to fire someone. Stacy has done nothing but act as this woman's slave for the last three years, and Jen is just going to take Stacy's dedication, throw it on the floor and spit on it. Well, POOP ON HER! And another thing... I'm tired of all this stupid stuff about English. All these idiots saying, "Hey, if you see a bumper sticker and you can read it, thank a teacher, and if it's in English, thank a soldier." English is not the official language of the United States. Weird, huh? It is only "presumed" so in matters such as legislation, etc. This is evident in courts throughout the US. I noticed when I went to traffic court that they had a Spanish interpretor there. If English were not the official language, she would not have been needed. Citizens of the US would have to speak English, and would not be provided a state funded interpretor. I'm surprised at the number of people who have no idea about this.  If anyone has any information suggesting otherwise, please let me know. If you're curious about it, check out this link.  urlLink http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_in_the_United_States

         I was checking out the McDonalds website the other day to see if I could find any information about those commercials, but I couldn't find anything. However, I found some information about Neopets. They are these cool little virtual pets that you can play with. You get to play games to earn neopoints. Neopoints buy you food to feed your pet, books to read to it to make it smarter, and even a neohome. I'm working on buying Clilla (my Shoyru) a house in Fairyland. Check it out  urlLink www.neopets.com . It's fun, but time sucking. I've just been sitting here tonight playing the game. It's two years today since mine and Joe's first date. He has practice and then is going out with Steve. That's okay, though, cuz we're going to celebrate tomorrow. Well, back to Clilla!   Oh, and if you check out Neopets, and decide to join, you can add me as your neofriend... just search for Clilla or sunschyne8. XOXO        And to whomever signed my blog "anonymous," I'm sorry I don't have any pictures from fourth of july. We didn't have any cameras out. Sorry:(

        So it's Fourth of July! Last night Joe and I decided to have a BBQ at his place today. We went to the store and got all the fixins for a great party. He made beer brats, hot dogs, and burgers. Stacy came over, and then John and Christine. Jamie came upstairs, and Mark stopped by next. Cece called, and she was in a bum mood, so I told her to stop by for some dinner. Tony and his friend Jeff came by on their bikes while the guys were outside cookin'. They yelled to each other and then the guys came up for some eats. Then Cece got there, and we all ate and talked and laughed. We put the Cubs game on and watched that for a little while before takin' off for the fireworks in Lombard. We found parking spots right away and walked into the park, set up our blankets and waited. It was definitely worth the wait, as the firework display was one of the longest and best I've ever seen. The guys were funny, making comments throughout the show. We also heard a lot of funny things from the groups surrounding us. Overall it was a great time. As we got up to leave, Cece and I had a short discussion about our situation in Iraq before we were distracted by two men dragging a blanket behind them, on which a child was laying. The kid was laughing and having a great time. Cece and I mentioned how cool it would be to be little kids and get to ride on a blanket like that. I have to admit, it did look like a lot of fun. July 4, 2004... a success!! Let me now move on to complaining about the gig the guys had last night. First of all, it was a benefit for the family of a man who died in a bike accident a few months ago. It really was a very nice idea. It was at this great bar called Scoreboard. It's right off the highway, and highly accessible. There was a nice covered stage with an open air seating area, and an outdoor bar that was nicely covered as well. The bar indoors was small, but welcoming. All in all, it would make for great live music. Of course, it's no one's fault that it rained, but there was close to ZERO promotion of this show. The band didn't even have all the information necessary to promote their own appearance at this particular bar. When we got there, there were maybe six or seven people standing around in the bar area while a couple guys sang "oldies" on stage. We went into the "gameroom" where the guys' manager handed out pocket sized fliers that the owner of the bar/promoter had printed up. On one side of this little orange notecard was the story of the man who died. On the other side was a lineup of bands. The whole thing was full of misspellings and had no order or times listed, except for where it said that from 3-9 p.m. the show was all ages. Then at the very bottom of the flyer, in very small letters, it said that the show was until 3 a.m. An advertisement for something like this should be nice and big, with times and dates clearly and largely noted. The way the bands were listed was a joke too. There were descriptions of some of the bands but not all. For instance, it said nowhere that The Storm was an 80's rock tribute. At 9:30, as the guys were getting ready to go on, the sky was nice and clear. The chairs were wet, and the barmaids were making absolutely no effort to dry them off, but the sky was clear. The guys went on and gave a superb performance. Lightning was flashing in the sky as TJ Roxx ripped into the opening vocals of Dio's Rainbow in the Dark: "I see lightning...." It was poetic. The rain continued to hold off until after the band was done playing and had loaded their equiptment back into their vehicles. The next band went on then, and about half way through, the rain started to come down. Poured. We relaxed at the bar, where the staff decided to just hand out all of the "raffle prizes" because none of the winning numbers were still there. I walked with three Napoleon Dynamite shirts, one Miller Lite shirt, and a Napoleon Dynamite chapstick. Oh yeah, and an Ashlee Simpson demo CD. Somehow, Mark E. Metal got a whole picnic table umbrella out of the deal. As bad as things were, The Storm did have the biggest crowd of all the acts. They rocked hard, and did a phenomenal job. TJ Roxx even broke a table trying to jump onto it, which then inspired members of the crowd to break tables too. Some guy named Pit Bull seemed to really enjoy the show, banging his head profusely the whole time. I'd hate to be his neck in the morning. It was fun, and we can't control the weather, but it could have been so much more if the owner didn't have his head up his you know what. XOXO

       Gosh. When it rains... it pours. I want to laugh at all the towns that decided to have fireworks today instead of on the actual Fourth of July, including my own. I'm glad that the weather was so nice last night when Joe and I went out to Naperville for the Ribfest. We caught Lynyrd Skynyrd there. It was a great show. Of course, we were waaaaaay back on the lawn, but they had a nice big screen so we could see what was going down onstage. The speakers kept cutting out too, but hey, I didn't care... it was Lynyrd Skynyrd! A grand piece of Rock History, my friend! Joe was a little upset that they didn't play "Saturday Night Special"... but I was thrilled cuz they played my fave, "Gimme Three Steps." Overall, it was awesome. We didn't partake in the rib-eating because we're both a bit wary of BBQ sauce, so we had hotdogs and cheese fries. Oh, and jalepeno poppers. Yum. We like the cream cheese filled ones over the cheddar filled ones. Joe made a few observations about the people of Naperville.  They are as follows:   1. Everyone in Naperville looks alike.   2. They all like to yell things out their car windows.   3. They will threaten to have your car towed if you park too close to their driveway.   I would like to add:  4. They all like to stop walking in the middle of a big moving crowd, and most will even walk backwards.   Weirdos. I don't think I need to return to that town for another five years, at least. Tonight, The Storm is playing a big benefit concert in Bridgeview that I have to now go and get ready for. I feel bad for all the Harley riders that are gonna be there. It's raining! XOXO

      Okay, we watched two movies from Netflix this weekend. The first was  urlLink Paycheck  (***), which I really liked. I didn't realize it utilized so much Science Fiction. It was one of those movies that I was a little wishy washy about wanting to see, but it really is worth watching (even though Ben Affleck is in it). The second movie, which we just finished watching, is  urlLink Miracle  (*****). I was very excited to see this movie, and of course, I cried. Go USA! I remember when Titanic came out and my Mom didn't care to see it. Even though it was a blockbuster hit, she said she knew the ending, so what was the point in watching it. Everyone knows that Team USA beat the Soviets and went on to win the gold medal in the 1980 Winter Olypics, but it's the story that makes the movie, not the ending. This is a fantastic movie, and the elements that went into creating it make it one hit movie that will not let you down.

      I have only one week left before I begin my New Teacher Orientation! Then only another few days before the school year begins! I have so much to do to get my life in order before then. I have to give the whole apartment a real good cleaning. That place is a mess! I have so much laundry to do, I'm going to have to go out to the store and get more detergent! But I have to get all my teacher clothes in order so I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear each day. So Stacy, if you read this, I call the washer/dryer all next week...MINE! I also need to see my classroom so I can figure out how I'm going to decorate it and arrange it and everything. I'm so excited! I have my VERY OWN CLASSROOM!!! YEA! Anyone who wants to help decorate is more than welcome (provided I know you). Well, instead of typing on this blog thing, I'd better get to work! XOXO

          Tonight I created an Evite for my birthday! I'm so excited. I love Evites and I love birthdays! I picked out a really cute design, and I even created my own "party page" that I linked to from the evite. It's a really nice way to manage who's going out that night. I can see who is going and when. My "party page" has a tagboard on it, so people can arrange rides, or talk about whatever. It's so cute. I love it.  Birthdays are the best! I love to go out and celebrate my friends' birthdays. Last year I threw Joe a surprise party. It was Superman themed. I think he liked it. We had a blast. It was too bad that more of his friends couldn't be there. It was an odd day, and a lot of people couldn't make it. This year, I'm taking him to the zoo. He likes the phellyphants. Neither of us have been to the zoo in so long, I thought it would be cool to go. We were born six days apart, so his birthday is on Sunday and then mine is the following Saturday. We'll have a whole birthday week!   The best was when we went to Howl at the Moon for Cece's birthday a couple years ago. I have tons of pictures from that night. That place is a riot. It was really nice cuz everyone was there. Nydia, Cece, Beth, Amanda, Jenny, Dan and Sean. We requested a couple of songs for Cece, such as Kiss by Prince. And the piano player actually played it! Then we all went back to the hotel where we ordered a pizza and then fell asleep before it got there. Eventually, we woke up, got the pizza, ate it, and then passed out again. Woooo! That was a fun night. I can only hope that my birthday is as eventful (in a good way) as that.XOXO

      Joe subscribed to  urlLink Netflix . Not a bad idea. It's especially good for Joe since he watches movies every night when he goes to sleep. He picked out a ton of movies that he and I want to see. He got the first three in the mail this weekend, and we watched two of them already. First  urlLink Eurotrip  (**) and then  urlLink  The Butterfly Effect  (****). By the way, I'm rating on a scale of five stars. TBE was great. A real thinker. I liked Ashton in this movie. I had read somewhere that the movie starts out kinda slow. It does. But it's necessary. So it's definitely excusable. I liked Amy Smart in this movie too, and I usually don't like her so much.   Back to Netflix. It's so cool because today Joe took Eurotrip to the mailbox in the "postage paid" envelope. Now he'll be getting the next available movie on the list. So fun! Cece mentioned something about it being the "Blockbuster for the Lazy Man." I do agree to a point. The great thing about Netflix is that you can browse their list of movies and check off which ones you want. This way, you don't have to wander up and down the aisles of Blockbuster wondering just exactly which movie it was you wanted to see last time, but forgot. Oh yeah, and NO LATE FEES! Blockbuster really sux about the late fees. They way overcharge. Well, we still have  urlLink Paycheck  to watch, so I'll post my rating on that one after I see it. XOXO

      Well folks, unfortunately, I've had to alter the way I run my site for a little while. I went ahead and disabled a link on my site until certain individuals stop harassing me about it. What it all boils down to is that this is my website, and I will not stand for threats in my guestbook, blog commentary, or email. I'll disable all of those as well if people can't grow up and mind their own business. I'm not talking about my business that I'm upset about people getting into. What I'm saying, is don't start coming to the defense of others before you're sure of the whole story. If you're not involved, either butt out or take it up with them, not with me! I'm not answering any more questions on here about that stuff, and I am not going to honor any posts or email requests related to the matter. Items received from such persons will be deleted upon receipt to avoid further complication in this matter. I have a life too, people, the world doesn't revolve around you. And if you don't like it, start your own webpage. Have a great day!

          Today, Cece and I packed up my car with canvas chairs, salad, chips and guacamole, ourselves and some beer and headed out to Plainfield for a Sigma Sigma Sigma, Epsilon Omicron reunion. Thrown by Kim (the chapter president when I was in the sorority), in her beautiful house, the party was a blast! Gone are the days of frat parties, dancing all night, and gossip till dawn. They've been replaced by day care, midnight feedings, and mini vans. Bottles of beer have become bottles of milk (okay, you got me, we were all still drinkin'). We gathered, chatted, caught up, and reminisced. It was great to see Laura, Alison, Heather, Heather, Rebecca, Shannon, Stacy, Kelly, Barb, Carrie, Jen, and Trish. Everyone who had babies brought 'em, and I was so happy to meet all of the little ones. Jamie and Jeffy had their two, and I got to meet Amie's little boy. It was so good to see Jamie and Amie, it's been so long. Stephanie came out too, it was great to see her. I was ultra excited to see Marni. I always had so much fun hanging out with that chick, and tonight was noooooo different. Kim has a beautiful house, and her neighborhood is great. It's going to be awesome once they finish all the building. I'm so happy for her. She is so happy. Oh, and her daughter is absolutely beautiful. The late-stayers, Cece, Jamie, Amie, Stephanie, Marni and myself chilled with Kim on the deck as the remaining girls' husbands tossed horseshoes. The talk turned from, "So what are you up to now," to, "Remember when," then moved on to, "Next we should...." I HOPE there are more Sigma outings. It's too bad more of the sisters didn't show up. It was awesome to see the women that came out though. I miss my Sigma sisters, and I can't wait to see them all again. XOXO

      So tonight, after work, I went out to Applebees with Cece and Carolyn. It was nice. I haven't seen Carolyn in a long time, and I miss hanging out with Cece. My dearest sister, she is the most understanding of all of my friends. We sat and chatted about Ali's wedding and life in general. I am so glad that Cece and I have kept in touch all these years. I wish I saw her more often. It's harder these days. The older we get, the more responsibilities we have. But I miss the days of driving up to Evanston for coffee, trying to avoid the weirdos from the psych ward nearby.  I had a bad night last night. Things were going fine, I was having a pretty good day. Work was fun and easy. For the first time, my feet didn't kill. I got home and made plans. Of course, just as I'm about to relax after dinner, the news breaks. Not good. I'm disturbed about it. So it was a nice relief to go out with the girls and relax. No drama. Just fun. I miss that. Feeling comfortable in your own shoes, not having to watch what you say or how you say it, because they love you no matter what. No matter what. Sure, Cece and I have disagreed about things before. We even went a short time without talking. I've never fought with one of my friends like that before and come out okay. I don't know if Beth and I really survived that one. I can't really remember, it's been so long since we've talked. It was at her wedding, last year in fact, that I talked to her last. She said we should get together...  So of course, I come home tonight to more drama. I'm done. For someone so willing to dish it out...   I can't say I'm happy at all about it. Who would be happy about losing a friend? Why does it always happen to me? Maybe we weren't friends to begin with...  One step forward, two steps back. Now I have to apologize to someone else. And that person's feelings are of more concern to my own roommate than my feelings. She says he's probably really upset about it. Of all people. This is getting ridiculous. All because of one person. I meant everything I said. And it IS the truth. Like it or not...  This is the last I'll speak of this. I've done my part. The ball is no longer in my court. And if it doesn't get passed back... then I guess I didn't have anything to lose in the first place.
