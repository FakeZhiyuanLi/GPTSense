       (THE PRINCESS BRIDE)      I call this one the princess bride due to the ending so pay attention.     So once again it is the night shift. Why every thing usually happens at night, well I guess the freaks come out at night. So me and my partner C-LOVE are chillin mindin our own business waiting for our shift to end so we can get some much needed sleep. When somebody comes to us and tells us that there is a man crawling around in the bushes out front, well not bushes shrubbery yes shrubbery. To paint you a picture there is a brick island out front about 1ft high and 8ft wide with shrubbery in the middle. So me and C-love go to check it out with a few other patrolman, so we go around the corner to find this guy who is military crawling through the shrubbery so we tell him get out of the bushes to which he replies yelling  "I CANT I'M   STUCK!"  to which we reply get out of the bushes! So he yells and screams as he tears through the shrubbery fighting the shrubs by kicking and ripping his way through them he then stands up and jumps from the shrubbery with a loud  ARRRRRRRRRG!  So it was obvious he was intoxicated or on something. So I tell him "your not in any trouble just come with me so I can get you back to your ship safely." To which he replies  "CUFF ME OR KILL ME!"  to which I reply "your not in trouble just come with me" to which he replies again  "CUFF ME OR KILL ME"!  So while I distract him 2 of the patrolman from behind bring him to the ground and bounce his face of the pavement and cuff him. We then bring him into an office and question him . So we have him facing the wall and he decides to spit on the (UCMJ) witch is the uniform code of military justice for you non military folk. So I yell at him "YOU DON'T SPIT ON MY UCMJ"! To which he says something in German like  IEEE  and licks his spit off the wall. So I then ask him what command he is from, and he replies with the  "U.S.S.S.S. BUSH!"  So we find out what command he is from and as I go to take him to the van I took him to the wrong van by mistake where the k-9 was at (my bad) and the dog barks at him to which he replies  "FEED ME TO THE DOG   AND LET HIM TEAR MY FACE OFF!"  So I put him in the right van and me and C-LOVE take him back to his command . When we get there the people from his command come and get him and we go to take the cuffs off him he starts crying like a newborn baby "I tell him stop crying be a man." to which he  "replies as you wish",  I then tell him to bend at the waist to which he replies  "as you wish".  I then tell him to keep his hands behind his back as C-LOVE takes off his restraints to which he  replies 'as you wish."  So the Princess Bride gets turned over to his command and we call it a night.          I always wondered what this guy was on did he clean up his act or go do it again. But we are not in the bushiness of following up with people, we are only here to protect and serve. I wonder if he even realizes we actually tried to help him and if he saw us would he recognize us. But in the end    "if you do the crime your balls are mine."

       Let the superficial games begin . So one day me and my buddy are at work and we start talking about who is the better looking man. How we got in this conversation I don't really remember so I decide that we put up or shut up by posting our pictures on the most superficial sight in the universe known to man  HOT OR NOT.COM  .  So here we are in all our glory like  Gods of MT   Olympus  that say " gaze upon me and worship me" . Maybe it was just the fact that we were in uniform that makes the ladies swoon I don't know but if you were to knew me you'd already know I'm a pretty cocky guy so when I check hot or not to see that I am a rated 9.3 witch is  92  percent hotter than supposedly over a gazilllon people you could say my cockiness went through the roof specially since my competitor that was so sure that he would beat me, and is at a lowly  8.5  witch is like  82  percent hotter than everyone else, but wait hold on you may say what is the point mister I'm so good looking look at me Mr  93  percentile. What's your point well I do have one and it is this before I was this  God O Strength and Glory  I was the skinny 120 pound no girls having weakling the ugly duckling the catapillar so  I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE COCKY!!!!     But what is this to say about society are we so caught up in our looks that we will let a group of a gazzillion strangers judge us on a 1-10 scale of injustice. What about the ugly women who just wants to be pretty who constantly has a score of 3 on the sight does it make her think less of her self until she spirals out of control. Does it cause the kids who find out that she is on the sight cause to tease her more making it more tortures than fun. I know it is all in good jest but please think before you drink and think when your randomly judging people on hot or not that ugly girl that gets a 3 maybe deserves an unforgiving 10 .
