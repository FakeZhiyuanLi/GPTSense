So fathers day has passed and i cant stop eating the spice cake i made ^_^ my dad went out fishing with my mom and brought back some delicious felays (i cant spell that and neither can spell check), but uh somfen wierd happend when i woke up that morning....i looked out side and our little pond was almost empty....it was really wierd and when my parents came home they checked it and they couldn't find a leak or anything, the water just went bye bye.  I sugested our dog was reallllllllllly thirsty that night but no one bought it. hmmmmmmm i wonder what it could be................................... Dude!!! i HAD THE CRAZIEST DREAM LAST NIGHT ya know the show queer eye for the straight guy, yes i LOVE that show, well last night i had a dream that i was the straight guy they were doing over, it was sooooo cool, but my dream was doing that dream thing were its not really the reall people but your dream still says it is....yeah well so that was annoying cause i dont remember there ever being a carson in my dream....kinda sucked but whatever.....anyways they were all prettyfing me and i was like cool....then one of them went through my underwear droor and that was kinda embaressing.....but it was cool cause one of the guys i dont remember.....it was probably the interior desighner or the dude who does all "how to keep clean" dude, i wish i could remember thier names....well anyways one of them like told me there deepest darkest secret...he was bi(this comes to play later in my dream)so i was like cool and then i told him i wasn't completley straight either ya know *wink wink*...so anyways he later told me (while they were showing me how to corectly put on a hat)this horrible thing that happend with him and the other dude, like had gotten married and adopted kids once and one day like they were out walking in the park when one of the kids ran ahead of them and got lost, so they were looking for him and stuff and meenwhile like the dude who owned the park was like hey man better find your kid soon cause im going to blow up this park soon.......ya i know thats wierd but its a dream........so like they are searching and searching but they cant find them and so they are outside the park gates hoping the kid will run out of there before everything blows up when suddenly see the kid and there other kid that was with them is so happy tat she runs in to see her brother but right when they hug the park blows up and little kid body parts and guts are flying around...twas very sad....then the day he tells me this like its the 1 year anaversarie of this tragic moment(the two guys arn't married anymore by the way)and for some sick twisted reason they have a renactment of the day and i have to watch it....well its really sad and we cry and i hug the dude and then that dream thing happens were one thing turns into something else like it was never that other thing ya know....so now im a chick and that piece of info the dude told me(he's bi) kicks in and we are about to kiss and stuff when i wake up........very odd dream i must say ^_^

I didn't do bed because the wall space that i would have to paint it on would paint on the murals....so yeah, tis cool
