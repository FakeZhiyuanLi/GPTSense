      Donya had me and some friends over for a dinner party. It was a bit of a house warming.  Unfortunately she didn't have enough chairs, so I had to lend her the chairs in my bedroom.  So here I am, typing on my knees.  I went to Sylvian's house the other night.  We watched a movie.  Well, it would be considered an honor to call the Truth About Charlie a movie.  This movie was horrible!  Sometimes bad movies are the best mentors.  They enable you to clearly identify what you dislike, and what you consider to be poor filmmaking. Sometimes we learn more from these examples.  Even when I watch a bad movie, I try to find something of interest.  Sylvain was so pissed that Hollywood's depiction of France included old cars.  "we haven't had cars like that in the past ten years," he exclaimed.  Sylvain couldn't get over the cliche depictions of American France.  I posed the following as an answer and refute to his statement.  I don't hold too many expectations of the American public.  Especially when it comes to films.  I told Sylvania that had the classic old French cars and cliche idiosyncrasies not been presented, that the American public would forget what city we were in.  That's literally how bad it is.  We are told what to believe and how to feel.  Editing, music, mise en scene force us to feel the way a director chooses.  This power is something I admire and idealize, but it becomes interesting when it crosses cultural boundaries.  We have to trick our own audiences by giving them stock resemblances of a lifestyle that we can only imagine through the eloquence of film.  Its fake, and it's real to us all at the same time.  We know what we are watching, and we are told how to feel.  What an incredible art form.

      If I knew the actual title of this film I would have written it.  I don't though.  I would like to start this post by pointing out how excited I am that the last post inspired so much discourse.  I can only hope for the same kind of attention in future posts.  Despite what you might think, I don't go to the movies that often.  There is never really anything that I want to see. In a state of depression, I tagged along with my friends to see Harry Potter 3 (HP3). During one of the previews I remember leaning over to my friend Monica and saying, "I think I'm going to change my career."  It's frustrating as a filmmaker to see previews for what I consider to be crap and realize that these are the kinds of films that get funding.  I was worried as to what the film itself would be like.  I'm not much of a Harry Potter fan.  I can only hope that my films will one day inspire the kind of loyalty in that of a Harry Potter fan.  As far as the film goes, I could care less.  I'm told that the books are great.  I'm told that if I read the books I'll love the films.  In my opinion, a film should stand on it's own.  You shouldn't have to bring anything with you, like already reading the book.  There are no prerequisites in movie watching.  Harry Potter 3 does seem to stand on its own; it's just not my kind of movie.    I've never made it through the first two Harry Potter movies.  I fall asleep midway every time.  I made it through Harry Potter 3, so it must be the best film of the three.  I suppose what I am really trying to say about this film is that my opinion is indifferent.  If you're into the books and the first two movies, you're going to like the film.  So go and see it if you haven't.  If you're among the 1% of American's like me who could care less, then rent Sunset Blvd.  You'll be much happier and have the luxury of seeing the old lady who threw the heart of the ocean overboard when she was 40.    "The china had never been used, the sheets had never been slept in, Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was."  I have no idea where that came from.  Back to Potter.  Even when I see a bad movie I manage to come back with something that I liked.  HP3 is not a bad movie.  It's just not for me.  It's very standard, which is fine.  The audience is not there for symbolic imagery or theoretical editing.  You're there to see your book come alive, and I'm told the film does a great job at that.  What I find to be the films best feature is Act 3.  The entire resolution comes via time travel.  Now I would normally say that the screenwriter painted himself in a corner and came up with time travel as a way to get out, but I'm letting it go because it was so well written.  I've been obsessed with time travel ever since Back to the Future.  I tried to remake the film with a time traveling bike in sixth grade.  The footage was sadly lost.  The way HP3 was different was that before the time traveling occurred several events took place that were a bit odd, all of which were explained when the characters went back in time.  For example, Harry and that sick girl hear a noise from the forest... later we find that it was them traveling back in time looking on themselves.  Did that make sense?  I don't really know how to write this for it to make sense so you may have to watch the movie to know what I'm talking about.  It was very cool though.  They really drove it home with a ticking clock in the score and images of clocks throughout the entire movie.  This is a bit obvious for the average viewer but is quite satisfying to find.  Do I recommend the film... sure.  If you have seen one and two, then you are going to see three.  That's the way it works.  You will most likely love it.  If you haven't seen any of the films, then I wouldn't bother.    While the film has three distinct acts, it is very episodic.  Every film has the same plot line.  The kids go back to school and have to overcome something using their magic and Harry always saves the day.  My question to you is how many times you will buy this plot line with different actions substituted?  Did you like the film?  Why?  Has anyone seen all the films but not read the books?

           I had my gay friends over last night to watch a movie.  Most of the night was spent talking, catching up, and comparing Toby to the gangly character in  All Over The Guy .  This is a movie that I really like.  It's a gay romantic comedy that lends itself to clever wittacisims and smart dialog.  When the movie is funny, it's really funny.  But when the movie is cheesy, it's almost painful.  In this respect it really is just like any other romantic comedy but with gay characters.         Did the boys like it?  Not really.  Sylvain moaned and said, "when is it going to be over?"  Jared was counting down the minutes.  Toby and I found it romantic when one character made breakfast in bed for the other, while the other boys proclaimed that they would run out of the room if a guy ever did that for them.  It's interesting to me to see this kind of perspective.  Identity is so important in cinema.  It's how we relate to the film.  It's what keeps us there for two hours.  In the case of standard Hollywood movies, especially in the case of romantic comedies, us gay folk, have to assimilate the roles of the straight couple being depicted on screen.  This is something that doesn't usually cross the mind of the average straight white person because they have never had to assimilate to any Hollywood film.         For a gay male, or female for that matter, we have to pick one of the characters in the romantic comedy, the one with which we most identify, and assimilate their feelings and perspectives.  Something to think about.  So wouldn't tou think that five gay guys watching a gay romantic comedy would be pleased?  Chris said, "it's gay so we almost have to like it."  But most of the boys did not like it.  They just thought it was a bad movie.  I happen to really like the film.  I own it.  Perhaps we have become so accustomed to assimilation that we are somehow removed from the gay characters.  We picked them apart and laughed at them, instead of with them.  I find this paradox very interesting.         So would I recommend the film?  Well, before last night I would have. :-)  I still think the film is worth a watch.  Most of my straight friends who saw the film seemed to really like it.  That could have been a rouse in an effort to support me, but hopefully it was not.  After my experience last night, I'm more interested in the straight assimilation of the film.  I'm curious to know how a straight audience would view the film.  Would they think it bad as well?  Would they like it because they feel like they are supporting a cause?  Or would they set aside the cliche attitudes of popular American culture and isolate the story for what it actually is?         In reality, most romantic comedies are cheesy.  The chick flic, or the weapies as they used to be called, are sometimes painful to watch because they push the cheese factor.  Usually they have their strong points, and we all hope for the idealism they portray in our own relationships, but have yet to find.  If you know what the film is, you can really enjoy it.  You can't go to see  How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days  and expect to come out talking about Oscar.  But if you know what the film is, you may actually like it.  The same is true for this film.         I could go on about this some more but I won't.  I don't feel as if I've even made a point yet, but I wanted to offer some perspective.  If this is the kind of movie you are in the mood for then it is certainly worth a watch, otherwise, you may want to pick something else.

      It's nice to have somewhere to place your thoughts where others might be inspired to comment.  It gives you a sort of journalistic feel, while at the same time allowing the public to either make retractions for you, or embellish your thoughts.  The most fulfilling aspect is when a comment perpetuates an idea and gives you the freedom to go somewhere you hadn't anticipated going.  This is the first, of hopefully many blog postings on foppish films.  While the site is still not fully functional, I think it is important to have a forum where people can see what foppish films is all about, directly from its creator.  So I suppose this is an informal mission statement.  I hope to give you insight on current films, as well as foppish films.  I hope that you can introduce me to new film ideas as well as your insight to films that you watch and admire.  Until next time...

      Did I ever tell you about the time when David Copperfield made me disappear live on stage at Caesar’s Palace in Tahoe?  I was just on the phone with my friend Donya, and I don’t know what made me think of it but somehow the topic came up.  Donya is still bitter because I haven’t told her how the trick actually worked.  If you are only reading on because you think that I am going to disclose that information then don’t bother.  I haven’t told anyone, not even my mother.  Well, I guess there are a few things I could tell my mother about certain other magic tricks that I like to perform but this is the wrong forum for that.  When I was a kid, David Copperfield was my idol.  He wore tight black pants, trendy velcro shoes, and shirts that revealed his chest.  On top of that he would dance provocatively with gorgeous women and then make them disappear, or cut them in half.  I too wanted to be a magician, but thought the likelihood of me actually finding work was slim.  I found filmmaking instead.  Filmmaking is magic, and most of the time people just watch and enjoy instead of constantly trying to figure out the trick.  Furthermore, I often find myself dancing with gorgeous women on stages and wearing tight pants.  So I suppose I got the best of both worlds!

      Sound had once been said to be the downfall of cinema.  A once mobile camera was now limited by cumbersome sound recording equipment.  Technology has drastically improved over the years and sound has become imperative.  I mention all of this because I recently watched Fahrenheit 9/11.  Early on in the film there is a brilliant use of sound.  The scene is of the planes crashing into the twin towers on the morning of September 11th.  Michael more, chose do leave the screen black and just play the sound.  The theater shook as each plane hit.  You could hear people screaming and the event suddenly became more real than if I had seen it.  Sometimes imagination is our best visual aide.  This was such an interesting time for our country and the event really hits home to all of us.  I found myself crying as the following shot was of a grey city in a rainfall of ash.  People screaming for their loved one who were now gone.    	This is a really liberal film.  I know there are a bunch of people who won’t see the movie specifically because of this, but it’s well worth the watch.  While most of the film is light hearted and comical, there are many parts that left me wiping the tears from my face.  This movie inspires a range of emotion that I have not seen in a long time. Michael Moore really outdid himself with this film.  This is one of the best movies I have seen this year.  I highly recommend it, no mater where your political beliefs lie.

      Two of my friends Jondi and Spesh just released their new album with great success.  One journalist, however, didn't care for the album.  Please visit this link to read his article.  http://www.sfweekly.com/issues/current/garrett.html  Then you can read the following e-mail which I sent to the journalist.  See below.  Dear Mr. Kamps,   I recently noticed an article of yours in SF Weekly entitled "Party like it's 1999."  I read the article and couldn't help but feel offended.  The article evoked such a mean spirited feeling I felt it necessary respond.  I hope my retort carries the same cynicism as your article as I try effortlessly to emulate your "style."   "Maybe it's the mix of beer and Red Bull in my system, but I am finding it hard to be cynical on a recent Wednesday evening at the Virgin Megastore on Market Street, where local DJ's/producers/label owners Jondi and Spesh are celebrating the release of their third full-length, The Answer."  I had trouble getting past your first sentence.  I'm not familiar with your column which I think suggests something about your fan base, but for some reason you feel the need to make the comment, "there's a generous helping of fans, maybe three dozen or so, and their exuberance makes up for the low turnout."  I'm trying to figure out what your column is about.  Are you a music critic?  In your first line you mention that you are "finding it hard to be cynical," so it seems more like your column is about poking fun at people.  Is this the case?  In order for me to take you seriously then I am curious to know wherein your credentials lie.  Are you a dj? Do you spin?  I myself am a filmmaker.  I'm sure you are aware that film critics are well studied, if not filmmakers themselves, they therefore have the intelligence to critique others work.  By this notion I assume you are a dj, and have created music of your own.  If not, I find it hard to swallow that you are so quick to make outlandish claims about Jondi and Spesh's new album.  Therefore, if you are not a dj, or cannot make music of your own, then your article is based solely on opinion and not a critical analysis at all.  I just want to be sure.   I assume, and only feel that I have the right to do so as you have done in your article, that you are a journalist.  So you must be well studied in journalism and the ethical treatment of free speech.  You've probably taken more classes than you ever wanted to on the subject.  If that's the case, then I find it odd that you have such an easy time quoting people out of context.  Isn't that a journalist rule?  I'm not well studied in journalism, so I really can't say.  I'm not familiar with the journalistic code, but I am sure that it is broken all the time.  I wouldn't bother then by holding yourself to it.  If you have not studied journalism, then again I'm curious to know where your credentials lie.  Based on the two inferences that I have made I still can't comprehend what your column is about.  If your not a critic, or an ethical journalist, then how is it that you are able to have your own column in SF Weekly?  Is this just an opinion column, by an unknown, self appointed opinion maker?  It must be.  I'll continue then, knowing that is where your credentials lie.   Your next attack seems to be on your unflattering description of the fans.  What did they do to deserve such treatment?  I would love to see what your fans look like.  Do they look like you?  I'm not sure what you look like but if you have to hide behind written word maybe you're not so easy on the eyes.  Do your fans wear stickers on their back that read, "We Love Garrett?"  I doubt it.  Would you reach for one of those?  It appears that most of your reaching is done in the gross generalizations that you make about the crowd, the album, qool culture, and it's creators.  Do you pat yourself on the back for that?  Perhaps this hits home for me as I was wearing one of those stickers.  But maybe I shouldn't take that personally, you must not have been referring to me since "no one at 'Qool' looks younger than 25."  I'm only 23, so you couldn't have been talking about me, or a good helping of my peers for that matter.   We're you welcomed when you floated up the escalator?   Jondi explains the concept behind the new album and you state, "it was a bad idea."  This is, obviously opinion, unless you have electronic musical experience of your own.  I can respect any opinion you may have of the cd but what I cannot entertain is your arrogance in telling someone that their idea is "bad."  What are your ideas?  Are they good?  They must be fantastic.  What are they about?  You intrigue me.  What is it you create that gives you the right to make claims about ideas being good or bad?  When you studied at the school of creativity did they educate you on what equates a good idea and what constitutes a bad one?  Please let me know where you received your degree in creativity because I would love one.  I have found from my education in film that creativity cannot be taught.  It is something that comes from within.  Something that can be measured, if you like, by success.  You write an article about a two people who have seen great success in their creativity.  If you don't mind, I'll trust their opinion on what is a good idea over yours, unless you can provide me with a list of your creative endeavors that have been received with more success.   You continue to perpetuate your judgment of the album by juxtaposing a quote from Jondi with your closing line.  "God, I'd have to say that since I'm so musically ignorant -- I didn't have years of training  -- it's always fascinating to me.  I'll never be able to become cynical about music, because I just don't know enough.  I'm constantly surprised by what happens with sounds and notes and melodies and harmonies.  Maybe it's because I'm not sophisticated."  You then write, "The Answer, indeed."  This is perhaps the most offensive part of your opinion column.  Perhaps you have an issue with the fact that Jondi will "never be able to become cynical."  Maybe that is what hits home for you as your column is based entirely off cynicism.     Have you received many responses from this article?  An article like this seems to inspire nothing but aggravated fans who send you hate mail in response to your bold claims.  You are the meter maid of journalism.  But I guess you have a job to do.   Sincerely,   Michael S. Harris   p.s.  I will be posting my response to your article on my blog.  Feel free to check it out, I welcome your comments and ideas, even if they are "bad."  www.foppishfilms.com/blog.htm

      Does film imitate life, or does life imitate film?  The topic is highly debated.  I find that my life  is  a movie. It's just on going, and you don't know how the end will be. I have a weird feeling that when my life has ended it will have the ability to be broken into a three-act structure. Furthermore, I consider all of my downfalls, not only learning experiences, but installments in my E True Hollywood Story. People like myself have to plan for such events. So if life is but a play and all the people merely players, then we are constantly having new characters come in and out of the scenes of our lives. In the past few weeks a new character entered my film.   INT. ANDREW’S HOUSE - NIGHT        A tall and slender AARON GREEN sits on a chair across from Michael. Michael had previously heard about Aaron but they had never met. Actually, Michael had no idea that the person sitting in front of him was Aaron.                                                                                               Dissolve to:    I find it interesting how quickly people can become connected. Sometimes friendship takes a lot of work and sometimes they just work by themselves. Both are rewarding in different ways. Aaron is similar to me, most likely why we get along. Most likely why he asked that I write about him in my blog. I'm sure that if he reads this he'll be moved, if not, I was bored anyway. Aaron and I were supposed to watch  Barbershop  tonight at his house but time slipped away and I don't feel like riding the bus all over town, so we rescheduled. Instead, I called Gunita and asked her to listen to Celine Dion and make sweet love to me. She declined.  I’ve come to terms with the fact that I may have to check Gunita into a home soon.  Gunita and I spend all of our lunches together. We recently spent a day with our friends Martin and Chris celebrating their son Sebastian's second birthday. What a fantastic day! On the way home, during a period of silence, I explained to Gunita that you know you have a good friendship when you can sit with a friend in silence and not feel uncomfortable, especially on car rides. On road trips people seem to have conversation for a while and then have a long period of silence to reflect or think about other things. Then the conversation picks back up again.  Our lunches are like this. We were eating at one of the design centers by our work, a place that looked like a hospital. Gunita and I were not talking, experiencing a comfortable silence, when I noticed a large glob of Dijon trying to become an icicle on the tip of her chin. I took my napkin and wiped it off calling her a senior citizen. We laughed uncontrollably, and then returned to silence. If these comfortable periods of silence become too long, I may have to check her into a home. Here she'll have the luxury of spontaneous exercise in front of vending machines whenever she chooses.  That lunch with Gunita was just once scene. Some scenes are worth remembering and some end up on the editing floor. We take the good scenes with us, and leave the bad ones behind. Sometimes we take the bad ones, but it's important to remember that only so much can be done in editing. Sometimes, we need to make the edit and move on.

      I've been getting a lot of flack from people because I haven't made a posting in a while. What's that all about? Here I thought no one even read this damn thing because my last posting, which was in my opinion hysterical, received only one comment. Apparently there are loads of opinionless people reading my blog so I need fulfill my commitment and write about something. I like to keep my postings about films as this is a film website but sometimes I need to post about life. This is where I vent, and where I breath. So here goes.  I have watched a few movies lately. I've been trying to lead a more low key lifestyle so I have been watching a lot of movies. Last Friday night I watched Life as a House. I love this movie, but it's sad, so if you don't like sad movies, I wouldn't recommend this one. Then on Sunday I watched Welcome to the Dollhouse, another funny movie. This movie is amusing but I don't feel like the main character has that much of a character arch which leaves you feeling pretty much the same at the end of the film as you felt when you started the movie. I don't really like that, I like to feel differently after watching a movie. I usually sit down to watch a movie for a reason, and this movie doesn't seem to have much reason. On Monday I watched Amalie. This movie is spectacular. If you haven't seen it then you really need to get on it! Then on Tuesday I watched Misery. This chilling film still gets to me and I have seen it so many times. Very good, but it's a bit twisted so if you can't handle that sort of thing, I wouldn't watch this one.  That pretty much it for movie stuff. As for life... well that a whole other posting. I went to 111 Minna last night and hung out for a while. I think it was Beth who said she could write a book about that place. I think someone should. Or at least make a pilot for a sitcom. Beth and I amused ourselves by playing the straight game. That's basically where I try to pretend that I'm straight. I can't talk, cause that ruins it, so really it's a sort of stance that I was working on. Every time Jackie looked over I was trying to check her out. The illusion was ruined quickly because every time I would get my stance convincing enough I would laugh, clap my hands a lot, and jump up and down. I suppose that's not really a straight male quality but it certainly gave us a hearty chuckle. By the end of the night Jackie was checking me out. She was moist. I know it. Maybe I need to make a film about life in San Francisco. A movie about me and all of my hopelessly single friends. None of us can figure out why we are single especially considering we always seem to have the answers to all couples problems. Are we too smart to get into a relationship. Obviously with the knowledge that we already have our relationships would be very successful. They would be like power relationships. We would all attend couples parties and couples dinners and answer for each other. This posting has really taken a turn for the worse so I'm going to stop.  Screw it. Stop reading if you're bored, I'm going to keep going. The week before at minna we were talking about how guys try to remove a wedgie. Imagine, if you will, that a man is walking down the street. Then, an uncomfortable sensation begins to grab at his under carriage. A situation that could be easily resolved by placing your hand at the base of your jeans and tugging downward, is over powered by public embarrassment. Instead, the better option seems to, in mid stride, bow your legs out as if you just got off a horse. This movement opens the butt cheeks and releases that caught material that has caused the undesirable sensation. Once released, normal walking resumes and the wedgie is just a thing of the past. Ridiculous how this walk makes us laugh so hard. We walk around Minna trying to perfect it. People who don't know us must assume that we all have some sort of disorder that prevents us from walking like normal people. Yeah, sure, we're the weird ones.  So I saw this guy at the bank, and he was at the teller window, and he did the wedgie release, but while he was standing still. Can you imagine? I look over and the man lifts his right leg in the air out from his side and makes a motion like he is doing the breast stroke upright and out of water. Good thing he choose that option. You wouldn't want the teller to see you pick your wedgie. That would be embarrassing. The smarter option is to let a line of waiting people watch this little indulgence that I consider social suicide. I laughed out loud.  Laughing out loud is one of my most favorite things, when you are by yourself and you see something so funny that you can't help but laugh out loud. Everyone around you will assume that you're some sort of crazy person. And only you will know what is so funny. These are little games that we can play with ourselves to keep entertained. Try it sometime. I promise, you won't be disappointed.  After Minna I foolishly attempted to go to Anu. Why? Everytime I go there Gunita manages to make me stay while she mingles and I try to figure out where I am. "Michael, come with me, we are going to take Cece home." What? I'm in the car on the way to Milbrae. What the hell is Milbrae? I have no idea, but it's nearly midnight and I'm there. Gunita's sharp driving skills left us circling the domestic terminal at the airport. Do I have to check bags in the United terminal to get back to Anu? I'm confused. Suddenly we were on luxurious 6th street homeward bound. I was back in the bar before I knew it trying to figure out where I was. Jeffrey Allen came over and said, "are you ok? SMILE." Was I not smiling? I had no idea. I think people are used to me smiling because on the rare chance when I am not smiling, eight million people have to ask me who died, or what's wrong. That's annoying, isn't it Jackie?   Ok, someone give me a topic and I'll tell you what I think.
