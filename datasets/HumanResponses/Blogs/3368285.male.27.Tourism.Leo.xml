      i guess i'd say one of the stupidest defense mechanisms that we ever made was intolerance... me , i'd rather hurt than be hurt... that leads to being hurt more... a very vicious cycle. i wish mine would end... i'd have better relationships then. i really wish i could go back in time... specifically a month ago... everything was calmer. i hate my freakin pride. sometimes i just hope i could be peaceful, even for once... haa, that is a load of bull...

      as i was on my way to work, this old lady noticed that i was drenched in sweat... she offered me tissue. i didn't know her, she was just a face in the throng of strangers . imagine if everyone would just be like that. we start off being inherently kind, but somewhere along the way , we get jaded. that is so so sad, we should never compromise principles. they're the only thing we can hold on too in this life. try to search for that which makes you happy... and content.

      i guess mine is really eating me up. had three hours of sleep, almost no food... and probably have been staring into the ceiling most of the day. it really does hurt. and i thought i was strong , haa. i guess that wasn't true. i really would do anything, anything... ha haa, i guess. but of course , rationality and logic should always be a part of everyone's decision making process. somehow i wish i wasn't so rational at all...

      "sorry . i don't know why this is happening. all i know is, i miss the times that we were happy. we were. i guess the situation really wasn't on our side. i hope i could just go back to the days when you kinda missed me too. you know, it's so funny that i know i need you now more than ever but i have to go because you want me too. i want you back , but i don't know how. i need you that much i know. again i am sorry, for i can't help myself missing you..."   i recalled this letter. i probably just don't know ... or maybe i know better.

      hah, finally, i am cynical. another company called me up... gave me a phone interview, and guess what? the cynicism in the air was as thick as the smog in san fran. i thought nothing would ever make me feel that way.sigh, i wish everything was as before... everything was calmer, more serene... ever thought of reading catcher in the rye 12 times straight? that should give you an idea...

      stupidity is the theme. in my work, the people i know... i guess for everyone else. i am not self righteous or anything but i just can't help notice that. i hope this stupid phase would just end. it's so like a contagious disease.... and life goes on....

      my last post was probably portentious. the time has come to make a decision. and i have made mine. i can't honestly say this would not pain me... i am choosing the least painful path. at least i'll have more time for me, and my son... i can't help but just feel envious of people who could be so very selfish. i wish i could be .... my day started when it ended. i raise a glass to love , for once again it has won the day...

      familiar? of course... choices are hard to make. some lead to eternity, and some lead to ruin. some people choose using their reason, and some by emotions. i used reason a lot in the past. but now, i don't know... perhaps this is just a phase. did someone really say i'd rather be a king in hell than be a servant in heaven? i guess so. the choices ones make are a measure of their soul... i wish when the time comes, mine would shine, as bright as the sun.

      called and talked to her ... i really notice how my heart would go thump-thump when i'm with her. also this mona lisa smile that creeps on my face , ha haa. maybe it really is true that love is temporary insanity. it went well... she is happy , i am happy , i guess. that's all that matters now , does it? i hope things would always stay this way. but , knowing me... i'd probably start doing something to ruin something perfect, ha haa. but i do want to stay in this temporary bliss forever.

      sticking with my no angst rule... is great here. i guess i'm wasting my talent here, sitting down. working from 9-8. i leave home 6 even... probably the only reason i'm here is her , ha haa... lately my routine was work, home, play with my son for an hour or so, wake up ; wash, rinse, repeat. i've gotta do something about my sleeping habits. have been sleeping for only 6 hours tops lately.

      it's raining hard. cold too, perhaps too cold. i can't help myself from thinking of her, dang... there is something amiss. some psychoanalists say that when you fall in love you suffer from temporary insanity, haa. probably the control-freak side of me just can't accept that. ha haa, i kinda smile when i can't stop thinking of her with me , through rain or sunshine. i pity people who love. oh yeah, here's something to think of "the greatest thing you'll ever learn; is to fall in love , and be loved in return"

      called her up she was asleep. i told myself i would never express any angst. but why do i feel this way? i really miss hearing her voice... i really don't know what's happening, feel like i'm falling too fast, too hard. i thought i knew myself. a certified control freak, i never should have let it come this far... heck i can't even decide if i want to go through with this or not... it's as if she's slowly taking over me, ha haa... i kinda missed this...

      okaay, i met this girl. she works for the e mail arm of our company. initially it was just small talk through im. message here and there. which ended in me walking her home twice, seeing here at her office once, dinner (if you would call it) once, a stuffed toy and a boquet of stargazers. i start falling for her, maybe coz she bared out her soul, and started talking about personal stuff. and she is so responsible, something i'll never be. and yes opposites do attract. i guess she is my exact opposite in every way which makes her even more enticing. i hope you get the picture because i would never delve into any particulars. and it is SO SO hard to talk without specifics. let me see, fri we had a tiff... haven't talked to her since yesterday. where we sorted out our differences. and , apparently were making progress. she is something else, i am falling for her... i hope i could weather this though....

      how apt to start my blog with hi. and probably introductions are in order as well. i am francis nor capule, a heterosexual single dad of a three year old son that works for a call center somewhere in makati. twenty seven years old, single, poetry dabbler , conversationalist , and bull-shitter-par-excellance. i even tried selling the sun to one my former trainors, which i did , technically, he hee. i'm gonna have to think of ways so my blog doesn't become an angst filled, psychoanalyst' treasure trove of discontent. welcome to my world...

      i came across this on a forum i frequented  I hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair.  I hate the way you drive my car.  I hate it when you stare.  I hate your big, dumb combat boots.  And the way you read my mind.  I hate you so much it makes me sick –  It even makes me rhyme.  I hate the way you’re always right.  I hate it when you lie.  I hate it when you make me laugh – Even worse when you make me cry.  I hate it that you’re not around.  And the fact that you didn’t call.  But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you  Not even close, not even a little bit, not any at all...   yes, it's from "10 things i hate about you" kinda made me smile, and reminisce... but things has been set in motion that couldn't be taken back... everything is so surreal now, it's like i'm living a day-to-day existence... this is the best recourse, the best option... when would i find a unicorn to call my own?
