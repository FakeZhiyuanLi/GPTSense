       Day dreaming could be so much fun...   Seeing as to how you Smile and say nice things to me I wish that I could try not To act like a drug addict Or a child that's been caught Doing something bad behind your back But I guess the way I act like that Is the stuff that brings humor To our relationship You and I complementing each other Like birds of the same feather And I wish that I could make up For all the times I've let you down When I couldn't keep my word  At times when I say "promise" "Cross my heart and hope to die" And I look forward to a day When I'll be able to hire  F16 jet planes just to write your name Above the blue skies Saying I love you And I hope I've made your dreams come true

       The sight of Tom DeLonge playing an acoustic guitar in the rain on the "There Is" video of Boxcar Racer somehow got me caught into a frenzy where I imagine myself in the same situation where I'll be singing a song in the rain to my girlfriend and so I ended up spending the night playing the chords C-G-Am-F in my Kramer electric guitar which eventually evolved in to the song that it is now.   Nevermind the bad times That we've gone through It's all in the past Let's just make the best Of the blue skies And the bright sun Shining right above our heads Your hands clingging to my arms I'm so happy I could die Because you're here by my side And I know you're confused At this moment in time But I guess the world Could get cruel sometimes So just lean on me And I'll give you that nudge Don't you know that I find you sexy In a Meg Ryan kind of way And the way that we talk Reminds me of You've Got Mail Where I'll be Joe Fox And you will be Kathleen Kelly And I'll find you in your wizard hat With a wand in your hand Reading Jules Verne To the kids on the floor mat Down at your place Called The Shop Around The Corner That's where I'll see you  With your smile that embedded in my heart Oh don't you know that I was lonely as well But you came and I fell In love with you And all that you do The sight of you Pulls me into the blue That's where I'll call out your name On the top of my lungs As I stand here drenced in the rain Starring at the cracks of ligtning Thal illuminate the dark night sky Like Chinese fireworks on New Year's Eve

       This was originally posted at a forum in  urlLink indiefilipino.com  discussing the 911 attack, which I later on posted as a solidarity message for the growing anti-war movement on  urlLink infoshop.org    October 5, 2002  This is a message to all Filipino’s all over the world to oppose the wide-scale agression of the United States of America against the free-world. This is a call for solidarity to all Filipinos and other nationalities that have been or are still exploited by the United States and its institutions that are part of its neo-imperialist mechananisms. For so long the United States have deceived my countrymen with its so-called ‘American Dream’ and its neo-liberal brand of Democracy which was adapted by its local pupets during the Commonwealth Government era of my country. And the outwright support of the Macapagal-Arroyo Administration has stirred concern from various radical political formations in the Philippines to oppose the pupetry of the President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to GW Bushs’ call to arms against so-called global terrorism. Let us join the ranks of all the peace-loving who oppose the wide-scale call of the Bush Administration to declare war against almost (if not) all countires that are hostile to its foreign, military and economic policies and branding them as terrorists. It saddens me that my government is forgeting the injustices that the United States have done to our country and to other neighboring 3rd world nations. After seeing how the US Government used the 1st year comemoration of 911 has seized the opportunity to manipulate the trend of opinion and to rally more allies on its so-called war on terrorism, which poses the threat of a full-scale war in the Middle East has compelled me into writing this exposition as a voice of opposition and as a call for solidarity against all forms of wars of agression and retaliation. Don't get me wrong I do mourn and feel sorry for the victims of the 911 WTC incident. But the thing is that in a way the United States deserved it. They deserved it for the millions of people that died in their hands. Countless people have already lost their lives because of the imperialist interests of the US of A. The victims range from different walks of life, some fell victim to the economic sanctions that the United States and its other financial and economic institutions imposed on so-called members of the 'Axis of Evil'. Others are victims of the foreign economic and socio-political policies that it has imposed through the GATT-WTO, others are victims of its multinational and transnational corporations that plunder the natural resources and labor force of 3rd World Countries. And lastly others are victims of the United States countless wars of aggression towards people that dared to stand up to its tyranny. How many people did actually die due to the Agent Orange that they dumped on the water systems of Vietnam during the Vietnam War? How many of our early Filipino Patriots died during the Fil-Am War of the early 1900's? Did they ever thought about the waste of lives that they brought about in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the ending days of World War 2? Or did they ever felt guilty for those who died out of poverty due to the economic sanctions that they imposed on North Korea, Iraq, Cuba and Libya? How many indigenous cultures have been eliminated of the face of this planet because of the cultural imperialism of its common goods and commodities, that came in the guise of industrialization, assimilation into the market economy and forced migration. Aren't they also the ones who placed their so-called dictators into power? Who do you think gave Ferdinand Marco's the guts to declare Martial Law and suspend the Writ of Habeas Corpus during the height of the Anti-Communist hysteria of the First Quarter Storm here in the Philippines? Didn't they used support Saddam during the Iran-Iraq War to topple the leader ship of Ayatollah? Why do you think is the reason that everytime the Peso-to-Dollar exchange rate rises It is because of our economy's dependence to the US Dollar. Weren’t Osama Bin Laden, his Al Queda and the Taliban once pawns of the United States during the Cold War against the Soviets? How many Palestinians have died or became refugees because of their support to the Zionist Fascism of Sharon in the Middle East? Have you read the news lately a number of Red Crescent volunteers died because of the miscalculations of their so-called ‘smart bombs’ and this incident wasn’t the first one a few weeks before that a number of Afghan civilians lost their live when a smart bomb accidentally bombarded a wedding banquet in Afghanistan. How many people exactly have died because of their race, political affinity, skin color, sexual orientation, and beliefs under the hands of Good Ol' Uncle Sam? How many Muslim’s have been victims of religious sectarianism that have been promoted by the United States right after the WTC bombings? To get to my point the United States act as if the blood of the victims of the World Trade Center bombings is not in their hands. They pretend to be fighting for Democracy, Liberalism and all other forms of moral self-righteousness at the expense of committing genocide daily. What’s even worse is when GW Bush drew the line between good and evil. Yes I do condemn terrorism in all its forms but I condemn acts of vengeance that are disguised as moral crusades for the greater good. To look at it at a revolutionary's perspective I would quote the words of a Filipino rebel leader that has always been a target of each puppet administration that have seated in the Philippines after the 1986 Edsa Revolt: "The terrorism of those responsible for the September 11 attacks is horribly unjust, but it is also unjust for the US government to engage in far larger acts of terrorism by using the...attacks as the pretext or license for misrepresenting as 'terrorists' the highly principled revolutionary forces and movements of national liberation, democracy and socialism." To conclude the issue of Global Justice is a sham under the pretext of the 911 incident, to support any act of war out of the pity that you felt for the victims of 911 is not justifiable and does not make you any different from the perpetrators of the WTC bombings. So let this be a call to arms to anyone and everyone that agrees with what is stated above regardless of their political affinity, race, class, sex, and religion to dare to stand up against the full scale war of agression that the United States will be launching against Iraq or any other nation for its imperialist intrests, it has been a known fact that the United States has the greatest reserve of arms in the whole world, and that its economy has always been based on the industry of creating nuclear, chemical, biological and any other form of weapons. It could be said that the real nature of the US declaration of war is the fact that a war would be a good jolt-up its withered economy that has been sinking due to the continuing crisis of global capitalism. FOr this I implore all peace loving citizens of this country or any country let us not be fooled by Uncle Sam's trechery as this band called the Jerks once put it let us no... "...Go not gently into the night. Rage against the dying of the light! Sing a song against this terrible sight.Rage until the lightning strikes!"

       Looking back at the earlier part of 2003 makes me remember the tension that the US-led war on Iraq has brought about, and almost (if not) everyone's consensus was for or against the war coming from a very anti-imperialist background I was compelled to write this which in turn I e-mailed to everyone in my  urlLink yahoo  addressbook, which as it turn out got in the hands of my friend Agee from the Acid Cow Collective who was at that time organizing a DIY anti-war gig, which I later learned that this piece was the primer that they reproduced and distributed to the concert goers.   March 2003  In the wake of the September 11 attack on the United States paranoia has been the prevalent temperament among the Bush Administration.  By declaring a global war on terrorism the United States have put itself on a pedestal that denounces notions that do not go along with their interests.  And with that pronouncement has lost a majority of the goodwill that it received in the rouse of the WTC bombing.  With the first leg of their global war on terror the USA unleashed its military might on the people of Afghanistan, under the pretext of liberating the Afghan people from the clutches of the Taliban who are also said to be harboring the Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda Terrorist network the United States along with other countries such as the United Kingdom sent troops to flush out the Muslim extremists from Afghanistan. Keeping in mind that the said attack is a rhetorical form of retaliation, the USA liberated Afghanistan from the Taliban, and made the political climate of Afghanistan into a somewhat free-for-all condition, thus making the country and its people prone to other forms of exploitation that ranges from the Northern Alliance, which is basically a resistance movement made up of Afghan warlords who want to further their control of Afghanistan as well as from the remaining vestiges of the Taliban regime.    It has been a known fact the Taliban themselves were formed and trained by the United States Central Intelligence Agency as an organized opposition against the former Soviet Union, that once occupied Afghanistan. And upon the withdrawal of Soviet troops gained control over the Afghan people and installed a Fundamentalist Muslim state under their rule. Thus making them a friendly country for Muslim extremists that are against the evils of the Western World.  But if we look at the history of the United States we will not help but heed and understand why so many people hate the United States.   In the local context wasn’t the United States who bought our country from Spain, in the Treaty of Paris? And upon their occupation of our land under the guise of ‘benevolent assimilation’ have committed genocide of Filipino patriots that fought in the Revolution of 1896.  During World War Two weren’t they the ones who deserted us and a number of their troops upon the arrival of the Japanese Imperial Army, and then declared Manila as an open city, making our capital free for the Japanese Army to plunder?  Well, sure they returned but a bulk of their victory against the Japanese could be attributed more on the collective victories of guerilla units all over our country.   Weren’t they also the ones who dropped the atomic bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed thousands of Japanese civilians, and have caused the other remaining survivors and their descendents to suffer from cancer and other genetic alterations in their body?  In the wake of the Red Scare weren’t they the ones of declared wars of aggression against North Korea and Vietnam? And in turn condemning a number of their youth to their deaths for a war that was never worth fighting for. More so was the effect of the Agent Orange and the napalm bombs that they dumped on Vietnam, so that they could exterminate the North Vietnamese guerillas, as if they were mere insects.   Does any one of you still remember their attack on Panama, against Noriega? Can anybody still remember why such an attack was made? Nor weren’t they also the ones who backed Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War?  To look at it in a non-sectarian manner the Communists of the now collapsed Soviet Union or in the People’s Republic of China, or the Nazis or even the Islamic Fundamentalists also committed a score of human rights violations but none at the scale that could be compared to that of the United States have committed, against a number of countries all over the globe.  Moreover is their continued manipulation of the global economy along with their cohorts under the WTO and the other financial institutions that emerge under the guise of the IMF, WB and ADB have continuously caused economic collapse in the 3rd World.  With their slogan of globalization, and the notion of the ‘free market’ domestic economies that are dependent of backward modes of production such as farming, fishing and herding of livestock, have died and that countries with economies such as those mentioned above have, become stockrooms of corporate surplus and other decadent by products of capitalism such as electronics, fashion clothing, jewelry, accessories and fast food chains.   Not to mention their encouraging of the ‘morality of spectacle’ which blinds our minds with the patronage for designer clothing, over priced athletic shoes and the pollutive meat industry. The face of globalization has also razed rainforests into herding grounds for cattle gazers that fuel the demand of Mc Donalds and other fast food chains. And that the farmlands of 3rd World countries are systematically being converted to their sad fate of becoming factories or subdivisions. More so is the recent upsurge of urban sprawls within the cities.  And in the context of the 911 attack on Manhattan the Bush Administration along with reactionary bunch of republican dimwits, dare claim that America was innocent. But we could look at the issue in both ways, America as a nation controlled and manipulated by their so-called democratic aspirations was guilty, but the American civilians who have been blinded by the impression of freedom and liberal-democracy are innocent and that the terror attack on their land is indeed unjustified as it was also night right for the Japanese Imperial Army to launch a pre-emptive strike on Pearl Harbor, during World War 2.  But to put the September 11, attack, as a pre-text for declaring a full-scale war, surely is not a war that is worth fighting for. Especially for a country that has a long track record of manipulating world events to fuel is financial mechanisms and encourages the fascist tendencies of countries that are bounded under the yoke of poverty, self-evidently has not the moral ascendancy to do so.  With the recent presentation of Collin Powel of their evidence of Iraq’s amassing of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons at the United Nation’s Security Council meeting indicates the war mongering tendencies of the United States that it no longer recognizes International Law, nor do they have faith in the capabilities of the UN Inspection team to deem findings that are in a sense more conclusive and more un-biased than that of the United States and its monarchial puppet Great Britain.   It saddens me though that the Macapagal-Arroyo regime has been so blindly playing a puppet for G.W. Bush. It saddens me that despite the global anti-US sentiments that has been rising all over the world she chose to side with the United States and chose to blame the outbreak of a full-scale war in the Middle East on the hands of Saddam Hussien, without going into a consensus with here administration, who have been constantly lambasting her for her militarist attitude towards disenchantment that comes from the revolutionary Left and the secessionist Moros.  She speaks in front of the TV camera as if it is the national unanimity of the Filipino to give their support for the sham war that the United States is declaring Iraq, she even points out that it is the national interest of the government and that she even sites the Gulf War of 1991 as the rational response to America’s call to arms against Iraq.  With regards to President Arroyo’s pronouncement, does she not know that for her statement to become of national interests she must follow the Constitutional provisions which are provided by our rule of law, nor that her statement is a pathetic contortionist statement given to her by her Red, White and Blue Masters, it is evident that a majority of the Filipino are against war, and why shouldn’t they?  War after all means death, destruction and the promotion of the sentiment that men should give in to their savage tendency to kill anything what they perceive as their enemy without given a just cause. More so was that in one way or another our country will be affected if in case we a war breaks out in the Middle East, given the fact that more than a million of our countrymen are there working.    As for the Bush Administration and its war mongering tendency we dare say that their incisive paranoia against Islam, might lead to an eventual declaration of a Holy War against other religions mainly upon Christianity which comprises the majority of the world’s populace, given the fact that most Muslims who believe in Islam have the notion that they are assured of Allah’s piece of heaven if they die for their religion.  To resolve this we all cannot deny the fact that Iraq is not an idealistic and peace loving country. It is common knowledge that they invaded the country of Kuwait way back in 1991 and have committed deplorable crimes against humanity, we also cannot deny the fact that there is also that strong possibility might really be stocking up on weapons of mass destruction, like North h Korea but it is also common knowledge that the United States too has an arsenal that makes Iraq’s arms seem like toy guns.  And that the idea of Iraq’s non-conformity to a number of UN’s directives on their nuclear weapon’s program for the past 12 years, doesn’t put them in a pedestal. But the same argument could also be raised against the United States the mere fact that it does not recognize the actions taken by the UN, does not make them any better than Iraq.  But we should also focus our attention as why does the impending war must be resisted, it is for the fact also that more than a million Iraqi civilians have already died due to the economic sanctions that was implemented by the United States on them right after, the war on the Persian Gulf.   More so also is the United State’s biases towards the militarist response of the Israeli people to the disenfranchised Palestinian people, in the Gaza strip. And their all out support for the blatant attacks of the Israeli military against Palestinian civilians.  It is also worth considering as to why hasn’t there been much of a huge resistance within Iraq against the government of Saddam.  If justice means the removal of Saddam Hussein from power let us let that initiative come from the Iraqi people after all is not their nation and aren’t they the ones who’ll be directly affected if in case a war breaks out  As for the United States the war mongering paranoia of their government has caused their populace to live in fear and that it now encourages religious, ethnic and racial sectarianism within its people more so is that the people of America now realizes that the good old US of A is not the guardian of liberty that it claims to be. Shouldn’t they rather work upon the making their amends for their previous felony against their rivals and former rivals rather than rally support for a war that might mean the absolute annihilation of our planet’s denizens.  In conclusion is it not the absolute aspiration of all sentient inhabitants of this planet is peace and unity. So in response to this issue, let us chose not the attitude of fault finding which the United States is doing right now. Let us all chose neutrality, and peace as a solution for this predicament that faces this planet. More so we should also stretch our hands in solidarity with all movements that are against this war, and lastly resolve it within ourselves that we should pray that the growing hatred of the United States and Iraq against each other be met with a genuine resolving of their differences and a more sincere attitude towards implementing a lasting peace agreement between the Arab and Western world.

       Again this has been written during the first leg of America's invasion of Iraq. I was looking for news regarding the war when I suddenly came across a petition that was being utilized by  urlLink Greenpeace  &  urlLink Amnesty International  regarding the  urlLink Uniting for Peace  resolution for the  urlLink UN General Assembly  since the  urlLink Security Council  failed miserably to prevent the US from perpetrating such an act of agression. And the deal was there has to be at least a million signatories for the petition so what I did to help is I wrote this statement and attached it with the  urlLink hyperlink to the petition  and then sent it via e-mail to everyone I knew who has access to the internet.   May 2003  Although the war has started this does not mean that we should give up.  For the past few days, more than 27 thousand people from 119 countries have sent letters to their UN ambassadors asking them to support a "Uniting for Peace" resolution in the UN General Assembly to make clear the world's opposition to a devastating and illegal war in Iraq waged by the United States and a small group of allies.  The Uniting for Peace resolution has stopped wars before, even after they've broken out. The United Nations should not accept being relegated to a strictly humanitarian role when it could still play a powerful role in stopping this conflict.  Because more than 30 million people have been out in the streets to say "No" to this war. More than half the Security Council, given a chance, would say "No" to this war, as would the overwhelming majority of the UN General Assembly. But the Security Council has failed us. It's time for the General Assembly of the United Nations, which more thoroughly represents the voice of this world's people, to rise up and demand that Iraq be disarmed peacefully, and that the slaughter of innocent Iraqis cease immediately.  It is with high hopes that I am urging you to promote the awareness to this resolution by spreading the word of such a resolution which is presently being pushed by the UN General Assembly. In 1950, the United Nations agreed a way to address impasses at the Security Council. The "Uniting for Peace" resolution (resolution 377A) was designed to bring the entire General Assembly together to address a "threat to peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression" when the Security Council failed to reach agreement. For this reason also I am writing to you as this war takes its course in Iraq to express my concern at the potential use of indiscriminate weapons that may not sufficiently distinguish between military and civilian targets and which will thus contravene customary international humanitarian law. More so because I believe that by their very nature nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and anti-personnel landmines cannot be used in a manner which does not violate the principle of distinction between civilian and military target.  Although some high-ranking military officials would claim that some weapons such as cluster bombs are designed to be targeted at military objectives, the fact that five per cent and sometimes a much greater proportion fail to explode on impact means that unexploded bomblets are left behind on the ground. They can then be triggered by civilian victims, functioning in exactly the same way as anti-personnel mines, which have been banned by the 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty. I urge you to support a moratorium on the use of cluster bombs.   The Pentagon should attest their claim of the preciseness of long-range missiles that are inaccurate, such as long range Scuds, which has just recently killed a number of Iraqi civilians when they landed on a market place Basra. Nor should aerial bombing from altitudes of above 15,000 feet, since recent experience in Kosovo has shown that this does not allow for full adherence to international humanitarian law requiring parties to make every effort to distinguish civilians from military targets.  Moreover, given the continuing reports of health and environmental damage that may be caused by depleted uranium, further independent medical evidence should be published showing that uranium-tipped weapons are safe before use of these controversial weapons continues.  Opposition against such should be advocated because it promotes carnage and violates one of the basic rights of people, which is to live and more so to live a life of peace. Mainly because the American and British invasion of Iraq is both illegal and immoral: illegal because the Iraqi government did not launch an offensive strike against America and Great Britain which doesn't give it ground as a defensive action moreover it is also a clear violation of resolution 1441 which was passed by the UN Security Council to address the issue of Iraq's, alleged harboring of weapons of mass destruction which is as claimed by the US and British government as their primary rationale for launching such an attack.  And immoral because it purveys a self-righteous assertion that promotes violence against a particular race and religious tenet. The military action that we are witnessing right now is called aggression, which is a manifestation of their imperialist interests. Foremost for the rich oil reserves that Iraq has kept on hand.  Their moral claim of liberating Iraq from the clutches of Saddam and his tyranny is not worthy of the cause, because genuine liberation comes from the people who are subjected to tyranny not from some foreign self-proclaimed messiah of democracy. Let the initiative for freedom from the dominion of Saddam come from the Iraqi people not from G.W. Bush, Tony Blair or whoever it is that claims to be the savior of the Iraqi people from the bondage of tyranny. We cannot entrust the fate of the world from leaders whose perception of war are from that of a Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay motion picture. Let not be the blood that has been shed and is being continuously being shed be in our apathetic hands as we sit idle in front of our television sets! Unite for peace! No blood for oil!

       This was written after having just graduated from college four months earlier. The second leg has attracted a unified anti-American opposition the then Secretary of National Defense Angelo Reyes issued a statement that a number of State Colleges/Universites nameley  urlLink UP  &  urlLink PUP  are high-risk schools which means that they are harbouring potential terrorists since they encourage the pressence of progressive blocks in their campuses. Having graduated from a state university I myself was enraged by the said statement which lead me into writing this personal rebuttal which I originally wrote in a piece of yellow paper that I later on typed in my  urlLink old office .   August 2002  There is nothing new about the issue of campuses as the nesting ground for future terrorists.  Awareness, absolution of thought and the inalienable desire for national liberation, democracy and equality, has always been a cause of alarm within the ranks of the reactionaries especially those in the armed forces. Their misguided sense of preserving peace and order has been one of the many reasons why the campuses of certain state colleges and universities (SCUs) as well as certain private schools that encourage freedom of thought and expression within its college grounds are branded as high risk colleges that harbor future terrorists.  Their sense of order that is founded on the principle of blind obedience and enforced order has always made them think that they are morally upright because of their snappy disposition, glowing aesthetics, and manly built-up. As opposed to those campus radicals who wear secondhand patchy clothes, rubber sandals, worn-out sneakers, red shirts with printed insignias of Che Guevara, a hammer and sickle, a red star, the phrase serve the people or even the "A" logo that stands for anarchy, that seemed to fit well with their thin built-up and that bad haircuts that they sport.  Those people in the military have always been made to believe that order can only be maintained by means of force in the sense that violence catered as punishment is the only good reinforcement for imposing self-discipline. They have always believed that only the leaders have the right to think.  They are afraid of such campuses because it encourages its students to think, not in the academic sense but in the sense that the young has a social responsibility to aspire for excellence and for the upliftment of the exploited segments of society and the need for sustainable development in an environmental context.  For whose right do these so-called 'student terrorists' fight for anyway?  Is it not for their right for quality education?  It is a sad fact that the government allocates funds that are supposed to be given to education to the military. Preserving peace and order is a good cause, but not if its pretext is for making our country friendly for multinational and transnational corporations to plunder (MNCs & TNCs) our natural resources.  Besides what of those hundreds of thousands if Filipino out-of-school youth that are deprived of state-subsidized education, because of the higher-quota in the sense that the cut-off for entrance examination of SCUs are very much higher that only a very small portion of high-school graduates from underprivileged families are able to enter college. And the very reason for this is the implementation of budgetary constraints, for the reason that a huge sum of the budget that is supposed to be given to the SCUs are instead given to the armed forces so that they can implement their long-running modernization program. Does this mean that our government is not interested in investing for our country's future?  We sure hope not.  It is also a sad fact that a majority of SCUs and other colleges and universities are aligning their curriculum to the standards of the so-called globalization. It saddens me that so many subjects in college nowadays are shelved to make way for more studying of the English language, more mathematics and more skills development subjects. It is indeed a cause of despair for a majority of educators within the academe who teaches such subjects as Filipino, Semantics, Humanities, Philosophy, Sociology and other subjects that delve with seemingly metaphysical areas of study.  At present our government and its branches of service within science and technology are encouraging most of our young ones to patronize courses in engineering, accountancy, nursing and other skill based education programs. In fact it persuades the youth to enroll in computer schools, vocational learning centers and business schools rather than to enroll in traditional colleges.  The idea behind it is the whole globalization concept where it is centered in free enterprise and liberal trade. But the bottom-line is that our government would rather have our college graduates to work as computer programmers, engineers, nurses in other countries rather than here. They are more interested in the foreign currency that they'll bring rather than improving our domestic economy.  Another thing that our government feels threatened by student activists is because of the fact that they fight for such low segments in the societal strata such as the workers, farmers, women, drivers, fisher folk, ethnic minorities, indigenous people and the urban poor.  And again we say why not?  Majority of the students studying in the SCUs and other schools listed as high-risk are children of blue-collar workingmen, who try to get by with minimum wage. Now tell us if it is wrong if we aspire for them to have higher wage, so that they can pay the bills buy food, and provide us money for our tuition fee money at the same time?  Would the government still brand us as terrorists if we understood the true plight of our farmers and fisher folk who are constantly exploited by landlords and who are always subjected military speculation that they are communist insurgents? Is it wrong if we join our hands in solidarity with them when they resist forced dispersal because their farms are sold or leased by their landlords to be converted as factories of MNCs and TNCs; or to develop into subdivisions for the financially gifted who are tired of urban living?  Is it a crime if we know that the rice that our farmer's plant and the fish that our fishermen catch are sold to other countries, and that our country imports the very rice that we eat are bought from other countries? Then the government should might as well consider us as criminals for understanding that genuine food security is rested on the belief that the food we eat is produced and distributed by our own country.  Now don't get us wrong if those high ranking military officials really do care about women, then they should stop making sexist remarks about them during ROTC, perhaps its customary for such people to make grin jokes about women. More than enough of this has been exhibited in the ROTC. Second is that is it a sin if women aspire for equal rights with men, or if they seek justice from chauvinism, beating or seek defense from petty sexual bigotries that are prevalent in our country.  We consider it a sham to dismiss the legitimacy of transport groups' call for a rollback in the price of oil and gasoline, especially in the context that the cartel of petroleum companies that always conspire to hike up the price of their products to meet the so-called demands of the international market.  How indigenous and ecologically harmonious people and cultures are dispersed from their ancestral lands and from the face of this planet because of forced migration or assimilation into the market economy? Is it wrong if we have a vision of paradise that is not based if concrete roads, factories, shopping malls, high-technology and urban sprawl; if we want to breathe air free of carbon monoxide or drink water without any lead content or water that won't cause amoebiasis, or eat food that is not made of genetically modified organisms?  Tell us if we would be counted as anti-socials if we would side with the urban poor at times of demolitions?  How long has it been since the government embodied the highest aspirations of its populace? Has it lost its touch of reality concerning the understanding of the basic pre-requisites to the building of a just and strong nation?  Now tell us if our cries of action, reform and revolution are not justified by our cause. Would you rather patronize the fascist mechanisms of the state that harm its people whom they have sworn to protect?  Their continuous existence under the pretext of preserving national sovereignty is a sham because of the continuous intervention of the United States and other 1st World countries in our domestic politics.  So for these above mentioned reasons we ask this administration not to make a mockery of itself, by considering the youth of those specific SCUs and other colleges as up and coming terrorists.  If indeed our government is a government that is by the people and for the people why doesn't it act like one?

      The anarchist Do-It-Yourself ethic has succeeded in creating a flourishing counterculture. The scene excels at developing low-tech solutions to the consumerist, petroleum-based mainstream, simple designs based on recycled materials that aim at being user-friendly.   However, I think this success comes at a price: passionate activists put so much time into specific projects that little thought is devoted to critiquing how the entrenched countercultural lifestyle actually meets - or doesn't meet-people's needs. This scene is, undoubtedly, a scene, and it is not particularly open or inviting to new people. The scene takes on mythological proportions, and people feel they have to live up to certain standards in order to participate. Everybody is different, but people censor and mold what they show to a scene in order to fit in. This perpetuates the myth of homogeneity, and turns off people who can't or don't feel like doing the work to fit in.   Many people don't want to take on the emotional trip of feeling like the odd one out. It is a struggle to attend events where you feel like you're the only person representing, where you are perceived as 'different' and either fetishized or considered dangerous, scary, complicated, and thus ignored. It hurts to feel like you have to put on an act, to go into the closet, in order to be comfortable in a group. A scene where people feel bad for not fitting in is little more than a mimicry of the mainstream, one subculture out of many. The folks closing people out of the scene are the same folks who are shut out of some aspect of mainstream culture. At some point, everybody puts on an act in order to fit in.   In reality, all kinds of people are doing all kinds of different things, whether they are underground or out about their actions. People are much more complex than this model of homogenous subcultures. People do take risks, make decisions and go places they're not 'supposed' to. Unless you talk to somebody and they choose to tell you, you can't always see that 'white' boy's Mexican dad, that 'straight' girl's lesbian parents, that able-bodied person's disability, that suburban punk's welfare childhood. Perhaps you have not 'seen' that person of color within 'the activist scene', even though they have been at every major protest for 20 years.   The energy and time required to (re)build organizations and physical infrastructure from the ground up means that this type of revolutionary actions comes most easily to certain people, who are able bodied, young, frequently white and from middle class backgrounds, and with few commitments other than this radical lifestyle. Many do-it-yourself activists do recognize the limited potential of a homogenous scene-but people seem to be forgetting that homogeneity is the very nature of a countercultural lifestyle!   Sharing a lifestyle, particularly one based on political convictions, is a way of finding support in the midst of a callous world. What is a lifestyle, but simply a set of actions folks take to meet their living needs; a radical, political lifestyle gives political purpose to fulfilling this particular set of actions. However, everybody has different needs. Placing too much importance on living a lifestyle as a political act means that folks are judged as 'less revolutionary' when they make decisions that aren't in line with the political rhetoric-- or simply that there is no room for them within the scene.   Overt judgments come down hard when people are open about making decisions not in line with prescribed do-it-yourself anarchist rhetoric. People are judged for the kind of healthcare they use, the kind of job they get, the projects they take on, where they choose to live. Few decisions are easy when you're trying to balance political connotations and personal needs. To me, it's important that people question the models they're given-whether within the mainstream or within the counterculture-and make decisions that truly reflect their needs, rather than struggling to fit their life into a box. Talking about motives behind a decision may lead to positive, even revolutionary personal change (for everybody involved), while dissing a decision will more likely piss somebody off and make them feel unwelcome.   Other folks struggle within the DIY scene, or are simply not there, because the entrenched DIY lifestyle doesn't meet their needs. People running the scene engines are too self-focused, too passionate about the current state of things, or to politically rigid to think about changing course. For example, flier-makers rarely think about noting whether an event is wheelchair accessible-and resource-poor DIY organizations end up holding events in inaccessible back rooms or fixer-upper houses, rather than prioritizing accessibility. In a culture where few own cars, many ride bikes, and parties often happen up rickety stairs or in the middle of an abandoned factory, people with different mobility situations going on have to put more effort into getting to a DIY event. If events are not accessible, some folks might not even want to go to them.   Even with lipservice supporting the working class, families, and immigrants, the culture is not set up to meet their needs. People are often surprised to hear that somebody is working long hours to support their family or because they don't have the financial cushion to take on major financial investments (transsexual surgery, overseas travel, equipment costs, etc.) while still "living for free".   Events are not always child-friendly in the traditional sense, and coordinating getting a sleeping child home on bike is difficult! With creativity, energy, and good humor, so many things are possible. But people have only so much energy to devote to 'creative struggles' like getting themselves or their kid to some far away place in a rickety bike cart.   People who do have options should carefully consider their actions. Folks have certain backgrounds, certain abilities, etc., that make some things come easily to them, in the counterculture and without. In other words, people have privileges that go hand in hand with the mainstream hierarchical social system. These privileges give options and choices-the option to be sexist, the option to shop at Walmart, the option to fit in and be 'cool'. Not exercising your option is only half the process of breaking down the institution. The pressure to fit in, the option to be sexist, is still there-you're just not participating. Privilege and social hierarchy will exist as long as the system that perpetuates them exists, and attacking the root of the privilege, the system, is necessary to eradicate the privilege.   Everyone fits into both mainstream and the DIY counterculture differently. People change, and lives include contradictions. There are no perfect anarkoids. When we are open to hearing about what other people are doing, we see that the 'scene' is actually a lot less homogenous than we perhaps thought, and we are more relaxed about hanging out with people who we thought were different than us. At this point the scene changes into a movement.

       After realizing that the rest of my bandmates have decided that Life Is Trying is the least of their priorities has stabbed my like a jagged knife that went straight into my entrails, and the only outlet for my angst that was very much available at that time was my PC so I sobbingly typed away my frustrations and later on saved it on an MS Word file named:  RIP Life Is Trying   >	 So what do you want to know? 	To start with Life Is Trying is in a very devious way a completely uncomplicated group. They were at their time just a bunch of single-minded punk rock-loving dudes who just so happen to have the endowment to write singular thoughts and ideas that are translated into seductive songs of love, hate, longing, anarchy, mortality, revolution and belongings all of which basically germinated of the very heart of suburbia which is conveniently located at 35-B Malingap St. or M35B as they would like to put it. All information above surely gives you somewhat of an idea as to who exactly are these devious uncomplicated punk rock group once were, certainly it would apparently give you the impression that they are one of the most secretive band to have come around in recent times, yet at times they could be the most surprising. >	 What is this all about ?		This is a history of substance, apparent success and of moving on with our lives; a biography ghosted by the group themselves, the very best of irrational rock music, a question of identity, confessions cut with dry wit, a deflecting adventure in thought and space, a question of style, a parting of ways; the end and the beginning; a celebration of alienated consciousness; a sincere sellout; a voyage into the present; a full stop; a semi-colon; a question mark. Part punk. Part emo. Part indie. Part rock. And part whatnot. It’s the start to stop start; from QHS to PUP, from teenage innocence to young glory up to their apparent discharged college life anxieties, and to the eventual parting of ways caused by the sudden realization of Chuck Baclagon that his band mates no longer share the same passion and dedication that he once shared with them; from movement to movement; from the formulating and the shifting of priorities; from fate to wasted fortune; from Jaded to The Sane Side of Insanity to M35B to Life Is Trying and to the obscure nothingness of their wasted existence; from Jarme Mondragon to Mark De Guzman; from Christopher Villarante to Cedric Buenviaje to Reginald Unigo to then again Cedric Buenviaje; from Laixander Naguit’s guitar journey from Jim Croce’s broken chords to Billie Joe Armstrong’s distorted palm-muted power chords. It’s the putting together in a perfect new order the light and heavy public and private lazy and intense calm and frenzied concealing and the revealing of the hit and miss songs of Life Is Trying. >	 What was the question ?	Here’s one answer. The anti-social ranting of Holden Caufield the infamous protagonist of J.D. Sallinger’s The Catcher In The Rye; Punk rock, emo, indie, ska, hardcore, straight edge, crust, rhythm times and technological agility and new wave music and computer mistakes and dynamic sensations and noise filled suspension and beside themselves and many meanderings and shy purpose and lyrical caress and remote vision and great crossing and clashing and trembling and splintering of the mind and a battered acoustic guitar and the sound of feelings and melodies falling from the sky or blasted to your ear by a resounding distorted electric guitar and shadowy beauty and grave ecstasy and inexhaustible restlessness and looking for life and stoned perfectionism and imprisoned perceptions and a low key engagement with a world of perplexities and uncertainties in which one can hope at best to achieve the small satisfactions a kind of innocence that surrounds the enigma and what was the question? >	 Who are Life Is Trying ?	We may never know. >	 Where are Life Is Trying ?	They’re at home I presume. Or they are flying across the ocean. Or they’re right in the middle of a jamming session inside a cork-filled box called a studio infamously owned by the notoriously grumpy grouch that has become an institution of Philippine rock music commonly known to your average twenty-something rocker as ‘Mang Jun Alberto’, which is basically their home from home, their flight from flight; the only place where for a brief 60 minutes in their life they take the center stage; step into the spotlight to indulge themselves and their guitars into a spiritual experience that cannot be expressed into words; an hour of feedbacks, static hissing and rapid drum rolls. Or they’re still waiting for their drummer to show up for their gig that’s scheduled two hours from now. Though there are some certain hints that I could give you to point to you where they are right now: One is teary eyed with his tears dripping on his bony hands as he types his thoughts on a battered keyboard comforted only by the fact that he has given himself to God's lordship and has finally found a partner whom he can share his life wholeheartedly with. Another is spending his time studying some boring stuff about engineering and the likes. There is also one who’s presently happy at home with his two kids and his pregnant wife. Another is contentedly reading the Good Book memorizing every passage with the conviction displayed only be the Filipino television evangelist that we have come to either love or hate. And another is presently head over heels with the fulfillment of his dream to be actually involved in the making of a comic book. But wherever they are right now, they are in their own special way telling right from wrong, and indulging in slight extravaganzas. >	 Where do they come from ?	1) The late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and a pinch of the year 2000  and beyond or so they say. 2) The North; the north of everywhere including the North. 3) Greenday, The Cure, MxPx, Blink 182, NoFX, Rancid, The Offspring, Saves The Day, The Ramones, The Clash, Pennywise and Dashboard Confessional; Anarchy and tackiness, machines and glitter, apathy and sympathy, war and peace, ordinariness and extraordinariness. 4) The Sane Side of Insanity. The badly drawn prototype that would become one of the (sort of…) longest incarnations that is centered on the intellectual and musical collaboration between Laixander Naguit and Chuck Baclagon, and the apparent drum playing of Jarme Mondragon who still doesn’t know how to play drums at that time which was also hallmarked by the irrevocable departure of their friend Christopher Villarante as a member of the musical ensemble and as a friend of the band.  5) M35B. The most devastating imaginative rock group between Greenday and The Cure. There are some saying that all of the curiously naïve, deeply biased and fundamentally instinctive music made up of Life Is Trying, their puzzling centerlessness and their edgy incompleteness, the question mark that surrounds their motives, reputation, presence, absence, it all comes from trying to escape their very self-righteous notion that they have the in their feeble minds that they are an underground super group that never was. 6) The tortured frustrations of Chuck Baclagon to prove himself as someone who isn’t a loser to the mediocre world, which utterly fell into oblivion with the realization that Laixander Naguit and Cedric Buenviaje never really shared the same love and dedication that he had for the band and to his vision of sharing his tortured rhymes to the unsuspecting public who would rather listen to cheap senseless rage manufactured by hordes of dreadlocked, Addidas wearing, hip-hop infusing, rap-influenced, metal-zone guitar effect dependent  corporate rock bands who retail their ‘packaged rebellion’ on MTV Rockd’. >	 So what’s the point of all of this? 	Nothing. Other than the fact that this is a very biased description of Life Is Trying as a working unit and as a set of friends who suddenly lost the innocence in the music that they make, mainly because of the fact that they’re no longer geeky high school kids who can’t even find the courage to talk to girls and to face a crowd without saying “I” and “we”. This is the frustration of Chuck Baclagon materialized into words, to give himself poetic justice of the emotional turmoil that he felt when his band fell apart with the shifting of interests and priorities and the constant assaillance of the Freedom Bar concert organizers, backed up with the realization that there were really people who would take the time and effort to really go there, pay for the ticket and order a drink or two to watch them play their music and sing their hearts out, and that for the first time in their long lived existence as a band they would finally get paid for doing it. But sad to say his other comrades would rather go out of their way to pick up lousy discs of mp3s containing downloaded punk rock songs at nine o’ clock in the evening. And how it all doesn’t matter anymore because as Greenday once put it: “nothing good can last.”

       This is something I wrote for my Creative Writing class during my college years    Time	> 7:05 AM Date	> 9/25/00 Place	>Quezon City  	The radioactive glare of the television screen illuminated the dark living room that I am sitting on right now. In front of me is the fat ugly face of President Estrada justifying his all out military attack on the Abu Sayyaf as a step in fulfilling the country’s goal towards a globalized   national economy. 	What on earth is a globalized economy? 	From what I’ve read in the papers, and what I’ve seen in the T.V. it is the bulwark of making some sort of a one world economy and government by the means of using international economic, political, and humanitarian organizations to manipulate the globes’ macro-economy, political structure and society a contraption that will inevitably eliminate one’s individuality. . As seen on the Seattle riots at the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) general assembly it is unambiguously opposed to by political activists that follow the Marx, Engles and Leninists socialist ideals because of its capitalistic control of the populace; as well as the anarchists, punks and nihilists, for its ambitious and arrogant attempt to manipulate the free will of man.   	If Karl Marx were alive today he would certainly be alarmed by this disturbing trend in the planets’ socio-political economic structure. It would be very possible that he would band with anarchists like: Bakunin, Kropotkin, Proudhon and all their followers to oppose this impending consumerist invasion.  	Meanwhile, as globalization continues to be one of the main slogans in international politics, but it only manifested itself in economic matters, and its impact in political developments was hardly visible to the naked eye. There was only limited collaboration between nations even with regard to confronting dangers menacing all of them, such as ecological disaster, organized crime, and international drug trade. Terrorist operations continued in many parts of the world. A peaceful settlement was found in Chechnya, and in Ireland negotiations were under way, not for the first time, between the Irish Republican Army and the Protestant loyalists of Northern Europe, with Spain, was relatively free of terrorism, but elsewhere, especially in North Africa and the Middle East, there was a new upsurge. Attacks elsewhere, from Peru and Columbia to Sri Lanka and Kashmir to Mindanao and East Timor, revealed that this was not a specific Muslim problem but that ethnic and religious antagonisms were likely to express themselves in guerilla warfare and terrorism rather than full-scale military operations, which had become too costly and too risky even for large and powerful nations.  	It could be probable that we are just waiting for ‘apocalypse’ to come. 	Now as I wait for ‘the end of the world’ I could not help but feel fear at the thought of the seemingly impending annihilation of all life in this planet. 	Want to know why? 	Well… 	…During the time that I was reading the gathered materials for this research I had read of nothing but: alliances of Western 1st World Countries, the rise of Communism, the Cold War, the United Nations, the Euro-dollar and the Internet, not to mention the fact that all these chaos are also prophesied in the Bible, but that’s a on a different context.  	Now I somehow see myself as a futurist, like Karl Marx. 	People say that Karl saw the future. 	A splendid vision of sunlit egalitarian Karl Marx was probably the greatest visionary futurist of the 19th century. 	But Karl got it all wrong. 	The Soviet Union was a 20th century futurist society. If the streets, bridges, and railroads could be engineered, then economy, society and the human soul should all be engineerable –it only makes sense. Bring on centralized state planning, the magnificent ultramodern vision of Leninist scientific socialism. Free the economy from the bizarre whims of top-hatted Rockefellers and Bill Gates and the senseless petty greed of the bourgeoisie. Bring the full grandeur of the scientific method to bear. Analyze, reduce find the basic principles. Identify the trends. Anticipate the future demands. Channel the productivity of the best in the service of the rest. Put the full might and wealth of the State behind promising futuristic technologies like aviation, rocketry, electrification and nuclear power. The result? 	Judge for yourself.  	The Cold War. The Space race.  The Nuclear Arms Race. The Vietnam and Korean Wars. Etc. Karl Marx dream of utopia was a complete failure as opposed to Vannevar Bush. 	He was a classic American futurist. 	He was an electrical engineer, not a politician, but he told politicians what to do and they believed him. 	Bush ran the Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II, turning 6,000 head-scratching Yankee academics into the world’s first organized coherent military-industrial complex. He pushed the Manhattan Project. He founded the National Science Foundation and provided not only its intellectual underpinnings but also its political rationale. Bush even foresaw the personal computer-or, rather, the “memex,” the personal hypertext databank. 	Vannevar Bush probably had more influence on the growth of 20th century science and engineering than any other single human being. 	Come 1995, and Vannevar Bush is profoundly out of intellectual fashion. The enormous big-science Rocket State superstructure that grew from his vision is under unprecedented political and economic attack.   	I wonder… 	…If Bush showed up in Estrada’s Congress, he’d be despised as a goofy liberal highbrow. The country’s State Universities and Colleges (SCUs) were the nation’s premiere futurist outfits. Their services were deregulated and subjected to commercialization like OPEC produced oil. 	Estrada’s Congress deliberately closes its eyes to the future, you can get it won’t have a lot of time and energy for anybody else’s visions Like for example Mister President himself, he thought of globalization, so he declared war on the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf. Very off tangent if you ask me.  So now what do we got? The stock market collapses; dollar exchange is soaring at the rate of one dollar for forty-six pesos; withdrawal of foreign investors; continuous demonstrations of leftist radicals, feminist movements and labor groups. That’s a pretty good, first step towards globalization. Ever notice how the terrifying bogey of the Arms Race has simply vanished from the cultural radar? It skunk off with the same embarrassed reticence as its big shiny futuristic cousin, the Space Race The biggest political idea on the planet today is the vision that people want to live for and die for, the vision they truly believe in their heart of hearts, is reactionary Islam. The trend today is apocalypse now. The End of History  - A code term for the across-the-board annihilation of progressive social visions-is at hand.		(Still remember the Y2K Bug?) 	We flatter ourselves when we think we’re putting an end to history. 	The end of the world and the death of the future are always popular across the spectrum. James Watt left power, but lo! There was no Rapture. Just our national forests looking a tad more dusty, battered and acidic. 	If we can’t control the future- 	If we can’t make it do what we want 	-What is there left to say or do about it? We’re all hip to nonlinearity –anyone with two brain cells knows that the future is unpredictable, even in principle. Science fiction writers still like to jabber about it, and they are more reckless than a lot of other basement prophets because they have so very little to lose. 	But why say anything? 	The crystal ball’s as cracked and clouded as the ozone layer. 	Who are we kidding? 	Why bother to gaze into the future? 	In 50 years the world changes completely –but everyone who could notice and comment is shell shocked or dead. 	These things aren’t a joke. Here’s why: >those who don’t know the past will repeat it. > A vision of absolute power is absolutely corrupting of vision. > Of the facts seem to fail you, try historical analogy. What the heck, at least it’s vivid. > Practically anything beats depending on Scripture. > Demographics really count. All the people who are going to run the world in 20 years are alive right now. > The future is always overplayed in five years. This is known as hype. 	This is known as “history.” 	If the topsoil goes, it all goes. 	The classic Mayan civilization (now long extinct) had a superbly pampered class of brilliant astrological futurists. 	When in doubt, wear more feathers, eat more peyote, and pierce your tongue. 	Listen to Limp Bizkit, dance to Britney dress up like Marilyn Manson. 	If the future were really predictable we’d all hung ourselves right after killing our children. 	APOCALYPSE ALWAYS SELLS. 	It sells like lipstick. Because it flatters our vanity. 	When H.G. Wells, was dying, he somberly predicted the imminent collapse of all human civilization. 	Real futurism means staring directly into your own grave and accepting the slow but thorough obliteration of everyone and everything you know and love. 	Does this sound like fun? 	It can be. 	Just don’t expect it to move a lot of product.

      July 2003    Pardon my French (I don’t mean fries), but tangna talaga yan si Bush. I hope he chokes on a smart guided pretzel. Make no mistake about it, Junior is responsible for this simultaneous rape of Iraq, the United Nations, and centuries of carefully nurtured international law. He is the one who pieced together the cabal of ‘chicken hawks’ in the Pentagon and the White House who planned this war. It is precisely Junior’s addled Texas brain which has reduced our world to the intellectual confines and the morals of a street fight.    I’ve worked at removing hate from my arsenal of emotions. I will make an exception for Junior. I hate him and this war of his. I hate it because all the things I can wish for to lessen the arrogance of Junior’s foregone ‘victory’ have victims. I can wish for more American casualties so more lovers, siblings and parents can learn to hate Junior too. I can wish for more determined resistance from Saddam’s forces but I don’t like Saddam so I can’t root for him. I can root for Iraqi soldiers and civilians who are fighting the Americans simply because they do not like being invaded. I can wish for more oil wells to be torched so Junior’s oil industry friends don’t benefit too easily from this war for oil plunder. But we will be victims of an increase in oil prices too. I hate this war because it makes me feel so powerless, so trapped.    Make no mistake about it. This is not a war about ‘weapons of mass destruction’ or Saddam’s human rights violations, or building democracy in Iraq. It is, pure and simple, about American bully rights. It is Junior’s America sending a clear message to the world: ‘We have the military power to attack anyone, anytime, any place that we choose. If, for whatever reason we find an individual, a government, or a whole country a threat, we will attack them. We do not recognize limits to our power from the United Nations, from any other international organization, agreement or treaty.’   Saddam’s Iraq has the singular misfortune of being a ‘target of convenience’ for Junior and his cabal of war freaks. It is a small, militarily weak country, with no strong nearby ally. It has been bleeding economically and militarily for more than a decade, since the Gulf War in 1991. The US and the UK have been bombing the so-called no fly zone in the North of Iraq during all that time. The US has openly helped anti-Saddam Iraqis. Iraq was picked because it is militarily and politically vulnerable. Junior’s rationale for war, the military threat of Saddam, is pure unadulterated bullshit. Iraq is being attacked not because it is strong, but because it is weak. We are all supposed to be in ‘awe’ of American military power. But Americans cannot be ‘shocked’ by casualties so Iraq was picked because it does not have much capacity to kill American boys.   One week after the start of the war, the Americans are beginning to realize that the Iraqi’s are not so easily shocked. The Americans and their British lapdogs have been surprised by the extent of Iraqi resistance. They are avoiding cities and the dangers of urban warfare where their air superiority and armor will be less effective. They rushed to Baghdad only to stop to reassess whether war freak Rumsfeld’s new military doctrine might just be wrong. The problem is not whether Junior’s smart bombs have ‘degraded’ Saddam’s modern military capability. The problem is that there appear to be enough Iraqis willing to fight the Americans firing only handguns atop jeeps and pickups.   Gains and Costs  In the end the Americans will ‘win’.  What is unclear is at what cost. The longer the war lasts, the more American casualties, the greater the political cost to Junior. The new American military technology, the ‘smart’ bombs and missiles and the Rumsfeld ‘doctrine’ of using massive bombing and quick movement are all geared towards lessening American casualties. The American ruling class is all too aware of the damage caused by the 50,000 American dead of Vietnam. The longer Iraqi resistance lasts the more American casualties. Junior may still end up having to rehire the Filipino consultants who secured his victory in Florida in next year’s election.   It is also unclear exactly what Junior will ‘win’. The Americans are so arrogant they have not bothered to hide their colonial goals: postwar Iraq will be run by an American general, only much later by Iraqis. They have explicitly said they will control Iraq’s oil. Even before the war is over, the Americans have already claimed the US$8 billion of Iraqi oil money controlled by the UN. Iraq has the second largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. With Iraqi, Saudi, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates oil under American control the US can not only make billions, they can use oil as a strategic weapon against Europe and China.   If  Junior cannot ‘shock and awe’ Iraq, it cannot do this to countries it cannot rain bombs on.  The anti-Saddam Iraqi opposition has declared their opposition to an American colonial government in their country. The Arab League and even close American allies such as Saudi Arabia will be emboldened to oppose the Americans the longer it takes for them to subdue Saddam. Most of the members of the United Nations including the major powers who blocked Junior in the Security Council are also opposed to American plans for Iraq.  Even Junior’s lapdog Blair is already questioning American plans to rule Iraq as a colony.   What is at stake here is a lot more than Junior’s political future. He can go back to Texas and pick cotton for all I care. What makes the American war in Iraq pivotal is that Junior and his cabal of war freaks are challenging the whole post WWII superstructure of organizations, treaties and other agreements. The international order in the past 60 years was anchored on bipolarity, on MAD (mutually assured  destruction) between the US and the USSR. For the US, the United Nations and other multilateral arenas provided political venues for isolating the USSR and the other socialist countries. Bush Senior was president too close to the USSR collapse to use it fully or even to realize what his “New World Order” really meant. Clinton was preoccupied with the US economy and other private ah…interests.  To insure unchallenged US military domination of all regions of the world, the reportc advocates a much larger military presence in addition to the roughly 130 nations in which U.S. troops are already deployed. "The United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia," the document warns, "as well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment of U.S. troops." More specifically, the report argues that the US needs permanent military bases in the Middle East, in Southeast Europe, in Latin America and in Southeast Asia, where no such bases now exist.  This is where the Philippines comes in. Junior and his cabal believe that China is the main potential strategic threat to US hegemony. In the aftermath of the Afghanistan war, US military bases have been established in former Soviet states bordering the Chinese Northwest. The US already has temporary access arrangements (VFA and ACSA) with the Philippines, but it clearly wants to reestablish more permanent basing arrangements. None of the other Southeast Asian countries will allow US military bases.  The Philippine military wants to give the US what it wants. Balikatan and the attempt at securing a combat role for the US in Sulu are precursors of US plans. Pres.Arroyo allowed ‘doves’ in her cabinet to stop Sec.Reyes’ plans for the Americans in Sulu. She has also stopped Reyes’ plans for all out war against the MILF. But Pres.Arroyo’s ‘moral and political support’ for US aggression in Iraq keeps the door open for American ambitions in the Philippines. The peace movement has its work cut out for it. It is a difficult, high stakes challenge.

          It was another one of those mornings when I realized that I was born in the wrong century.  The chattering of fully engaged jackhammers shattered the pre-dawn serenity, as a literal armada of construction workers marched their way down our old community park to make way for a new neighborhood commercial center. As the sound of the last ancient trees in our city were being reduced off to their certain fates, as toothpicks or furniture reverberated between my ears, it suddenly became clear that this was the punishment for the sin and debauchery of being apart from the norms. Damn…ethics, or the lack of thereof, can be so cruel.  I slid out from under my cozy blanket into the morning air. Not a good day to be me. A full blown, Catholic guilt styled hangover from the liberation of Carlo Rossi a full day of drudgery from my Economics professor's voice telling me that I might flunk, her subject for disagreeing to her personal perspective on globalization, and now this, the synchronized dance of the bolo's chopping down on their senseless fiscally unstable mission to destroy their last native vegetation-based ecosystem on this town didn't send a fellow reeling with optimism. What a shitty day.  You were born in the wrong century. You and everything you believe in are 150 years out of date.  What the hell does this mean? Was this the lingering ghost of high school guidance counselors trying to tell me to abandon my pre-industrial anarchist beliefs and grow up? Was this just the passing panic of every fanatic who suddenly realizes that they might just maybe, be wrong? A wise philosopher Wittgenstein (or was it Hank Williams?) once noted that one's subconscious was always in tune with the truth in our minds or our hearts. He had better be wrong on this one.  You were born in the wrong century…It is strangely ironic, bizarre even that while the rest of the world is doped up on the possibilities of the "information age," the global free market, and accompanying consumer oriented, macro-megapolies, most of the more dedicated anarchists folks on the punk, skate, hippie, gothic and rave subcultures have turned to the other direction. While the rest of society revels the fact that they can e-mail people in Germany, that the new Star Wars has better special effects and the economy is doing so well as to promise them a computer with better memory to power a complete Counterstrike Compendium, or perhaps a new cell-phone, a large number of us in the fringe have become enthralled with the idea of living apart from the blessings of capitalism and focus on the communal life of the early 18th century. While the rest of the world is thinking bigger, we are thinking smaller.  So, perhaps this isn't so odd. All of our subcultural niches were founded on the disbelief and denial of existing societal standards, actualizing this through an often-fanatical opposition to everything and anything proposed by the MAN. Perhaps it is our natural, liberty spiked punk response to the 'global community' and the plans of transnational enterprise, as Robert Hoyt (a famous Earth First musician) put it, "slam on the brakes and make a U turn from the brink."  But I think there is something more to this neo-back to the land, punk-farmer thing than mere nonconformity and opposition. For one thing, we are not the only fringes that are making the move away from global servitude and towards simple, yet self-sufficient living. Christian Fundamentalists, Black, Latino, Muslims Indigenous Peoples and Native nationalists, the intellectual Right and Left, and just about every rural people on earth are likewise attempting to reclaim whatever liberty and autonomy they have left through lifestyle transitions back to basics. Here in the Philippines it is visible with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front's (MILF) instigation. On other countries people are literally fighting and dying to retain their autonomy in this age of expedited economic exploitation and cultural imperialism. From the Zapatistas in Mexico to the Native Polynesians in the South Pacific to the indigenous fisherman on the coastal periphery of Norway, to the militias of the Western United States, out battles and strategies are the same. As funny as we are in our little secondhand patchy clothes/bad haircuts/guitar playin', skateboardin' subculture, we are truly part of something much larger.  Secondly, if you take a look at the folks that are making these moves away from the suicidal servitude of urban life, it isn't your run of the mill street punk with a 40oz glued to their lips and a needle stuck in their arms. From my point of view, today's punks seem to be more experienced (it ain't so much a matter of age as what they've done and seen) folks that have been punks and activists for a long time have come to the conclusion that to live free, we must have unrestrained personal access to the means of survival: to land. There isn't an adolescent sense of smash everything nihilism or a naïve posi-core "the world will change if we can unite the punks and skins" element. There aren't even typical jaded parasites one would associate with drop out culture in any form.   Today's punks are environmentalists with a good sense of what has to be done.  They are like authentic Filipino leftists that migrate to the provinces to wage their battle against the capitalist swine system on the frontline. This is punk truism at its finest, an anarcho-individualst statement similar to that of Che Guevara. Rural migration to launch an 'anarchist primitive communal' region.  Aside from rural migration there is also that statement of diminishing the greedy, corporate ideals promoted by globalization by utilizing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).  Waging battle against those two local industry-killing menaces has had its share of minor victories. The Battle of Seattle is one good example.  I guess you're probably asking why I am littering this piece of paper with all this self-righteous anarcho-punk shit?  For starters I am opposed to capitalism.  I strongly reject a socio-economic system that is fundamentally based on private ownership as its primary means of production and exchange. I think that a system that is driven by an exploitive logic that sees human beings as capital, as well as ecosystems, natural resources and culture simply as commodity is absolute garbage. I refuse an idea, which implies that the world is only valuable in terms of profit, competition and efficiency.  Did you know that the capitalist system has destroyed more than 80 per cent of our natural ecosystems and is preparing more annihilation for its commitment to development. It has commited genocides to thousands of indigenous, ecologically harmonious tribal cultures, ranging assimilation to the market economy to physical forms such as involuntary displacement, and mass murder. It created the fundamental need for fossil fuels, powering cars that kill humans and animals, and road construction that levels rainforests and promotes urban sprawl. It gave birth to the pollutive meat industry, which commits everyday the slaughter and suffering of numerous animals for food. Moreover it tears down rainforests to level more ground for cattle gazing. Now it claims to solve humanity's hunger (which they made in the first place).  In the Philippines alone, only 18.3 per cent of the archepelago are covered with forests in 1999, off the 70 per cent in 1900. Only less than 4 per cent are the remaining virgin areas. These ecosystems did not disappear into thin air, but of various, but of thin air, but of various human methods of resource extraction namely: logging, minning, factory farming and land conversion for human housing industry and tourism.  I want to live in an environment that is free from the overabundance of carbon monoxide. A world where people do not plunder their natural resources for profit. I strongly believe that it is substantial to establish a society in a clean environment where pollution, high radiation levels and extinction of species do not exist. I believe that a clean environment would intensely be beneficial for development.  I think that there is an existing class struggle between the vast majority of society (the working class) and the tiny minority that currently rule. Thus a direct action should then be taken to balance the scales.  I actively oppose all manifestations of prejudice within all circles of society. I contest racism, sexism, (religious) sectarianism, and homophobia. It is vital that respect should be put into practice towards the diversity of people that walk among us.  Furthermore, I reject the ideology of 'neo-liberalism', whereby corporations and investors are exempted from all political and social measures that interfere with their so-called "success:"  Moreover I am anti-imperialist, I am opposed to patriarchy and I denounce all forms of exploitation and oppression. I assert a worldview based on the respect of our differences and the autonomy of groups, individuals and peoples.  What I'm saying here is to hear out and appreciate the alternative lifestyles of the so-called 'lowlifes' of society. Support the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethics of the different deviant subcultures. And promote a more cleaner and environmentally anodyne standard of living by patronizing non-corporate forms of consumer products.   Support the campaign for a change in the government's Memorandum of Agenda in the context of the Muslim problem and military operations, which had become too costly and too risky for our country's budget (Food not Bombs!), or by boycotting products of the bizarre whims made up of top-hatted Rockefellers and Bill Gates and their senseless petty greed that is very much bourgeoisie in nature.   If you are fond of veggies then why not try being a vegetarian and prevent the senseless deaths of innocent swine, cattle and other mammals that are to be served as 'Cold-Cuts' to the Cancer promoting business of fast food chains.  There are also more uncomplicated ways to help out in preserving the environment like: turning of the lights and other electrical appliances when they're not being used; by recycling paper, bottles and tin cans; or by applying a more specified procedure of garbage segregation; we can also help by halting our use of hairsprays and aerosols that emit Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) that harm our Ozone layer; or by simply being kind to your pets is enough to prevent the destruction of our planet.  So I guess the rudimentary concept that I'm trying to imply here is that we must refuse the greedy, capitalist system if we want to save our planet.   Meanwhile, as globalization continues to be one of the main slogans in international politics, its has only manifested itself in economic matters, and its impact in political and humanitarian developments are still hardly visible to the naked eye.   Isn't it time now to consider our alternatives?

      I don't know really why, but as of this moment I don't feel that old to say the least I mean just yesterday I celebrated my birthday with Jeanie, as well as with my family and my buddy Laix and I must admit that the idea that I have been celebrating my 24th year of existence here on this tiny blue planet called Earth has made me realize that I am really that old. And that I am already way on my way to becoming 30 years old and so on, and as strange as it may sound I still somewhat feel that the day that I started out in high school very much still seemed like just a few ago and the day that I graduated from college seemed like yesterday and that don't feel that old at all though that may be a problem especially for those of you who are among the dogmatic crowd that says I ought to act my age and that the way I am living my life right now does not reflect my age as well as in the way that I dress or view the aspect of life in itself, I mean I still dress the way that I dress when I was still in college I still pretty much sport that sort-of 'punk' look which have been somewhat bastardized nowadays no thanks to Simple Plan, NFG and all those lousy New School Punks on Drive-Thru Records. I still adhere to the DIY ethic whereupon I live a life that is opposed to the norm that is dictated by the capitalist powers that be which is one of the reasons why after two years of living in the corporate world and at the same time becoming a part of its free trade mechanism I have still continued to presserve myself from being assimilated into the irrelevant oblivion of the yuppie culture that sorrounds me. And that is why I guess a lot of people are continually trying to drive their nail of 'you ought to act your age' into my thick skull. After all I still don't like to hear pop music, even if its what I hear all day here in the office, I still don't dress the way that the yuppie scums do though I wear the tie and coat but I can still manage to stand out by me constant refusal of wearing the torturous leather shoes that they all wear and instead show favor to my trusty sneakers and skate shoes. I still buy my clothes in second hand shops in Cubao, and I still haven't entered a disco even a beer house nor a pub. So if people would be basing the acting of one's age to those abouve said standards wouldn't it make sense that those are the exact reasons why our country is so down on the drain right now we are all under the spectacle of hedonistic self-gratifications and corporate market values as dictated by the mainstream media? We have all ceased the idea of youthfull innocence and replaced it with a misguided value system of merely trying to compensate ourselves with the notion that we control our lives and we can live it as much as we want to at the expense of defining it as maturity. But if we'd look at it closely we are no less than mere victims of the powers that are making us live our lives to be merely drifting to any tide of fashion, lifestyle, culture and the like. And right now as I look at the event that transpired in my birthday yesterday I find it no coincidence that God allowed me to obtain two such meaningful Christian books C.S. Lewis', The Great Divorce and Paul E. Little's, Know What You Believe, which as I belive are two great doctrinal books that could help us in assessing how we are living our lives right now in a manner that is more profound than Rick Warren's Purpose Driven since the two books are more grounded in the aspect of Biblical Scriptures which is basically the only revolutionary book that has ever been in existence and since those two books speaks more on doctrine rather than appeal to our emotions, and since this country is a nation that boasts of its identity as a Christian nation I guess these two books are worthy of our attention because it appeals to the Christian side in everyone of us who seeks to affirm what we profess to believe in but also to question the way we live our lives at the present. And if you ask me now that is a sign of maturity, so I guess those two books would be of greatest relevance now that I am starting out on living my life that's worth of my age.

      M35B has been around for quite a while now and I am not sure how many of you are wondering what it is about. For starters it is an address, you see this is the address of our house down on Teacher's Village where I experienced many of the fondest moments in my life, it is Malingap Street, 35-B the place where I grew up and shared my life with the people I grew up with. Where I have seen my brothers one by one leave the house to part ways and establish families of their own. Where I played with my nephew, (Gato and now Arno, Ciro, Gabriel, Julian and Linus), my niece Lea Grace, my dog (Odie)  and occasionally my cousins, (Kuya Joey and Ate Yayi.) The place where in the idea of forming a band came into order, when I first learned my first chord progression of guitar chords. Where I've had countless conversations about anything and everything with my father. Where spent the afternoon with my mother picking fleas from our dog's infested back. When I first received that life-changing phone from Jeanie and most importantly where I prayed to accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior. M35B is also a relic, in the sense that it is merely a venue for the comings and goings of events that have in their own way contributed to the person that I am today. And to think that there are people in my family who are quietly scheming to sell this 'priceless' relic for money makes me shudder enough to write these lines from The Little Prince, all over my room:  "Whether it's a house, the stars or the dessert; what makes their beauty is invisible." As a silent sign of protest to what might happen to such a rich treasure of memories that could only be found here in the heart of M35B. And that this blog was subliminally birthed out of the fact that the beautiful blue apartment in front of our house is has now been demolished and that it is my perpetual wish to spend my dying days in this richly laden box of joys and pains. Another is that it is a band aptly called M35B which was basically the name thought off since it is the greatest common denominator for the music that I have come to play with Laixander Naguit, Cedric Buenviaje and Jarme Mondragon. It is the band that was to play the soundtrack of our lives and the anthem of our anxieties during our phase nihilistic teenage rebellion. And lastly M35B is about me manifesting my hopes struggles and victories in this miniscule space in the World Wide Web, screaming at the nothingness and pondering the meaning of life in light of Biblical scripture, practical experiences, and cultural preferences. It is my personal Book of Eccleciastes where I would start out with the pondering of the meaningless of it all and where I would end it with the exhortation to, "remember our Creator in the days of our youth." So as to voice out a positive statement to live our lives fully in light of God's grace and gift of salvation but also of encouragement to make something out of our lives while we still can because truly life is for us to live. So if I were to ask you what M35B means to you I guess you'd better hasten my tongue and ask yourself whether you still find time to look into your own personal M35B.

       Every musician has his or her muse and most of them would give us the safest and obvious ones like: Mariah, Micheal Jackson, John Williams etc. Or if ever you'd be asked to name a late singer, musician that has affected your music most answers would be bordering over the so-called norm like: Frank Sinatra, Kurt Cobain, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Fredy Mercury etc. But if I were to be asked I'd have to say: Sid Vicious, Joey Ramone, Joe Strummer, Darby Crash and Dee Dee Ramone. These people serve as a great inspiration to me with their cool nihilistic outlook towards music. And for the benefit of those who are not so familiar with them yet try to check this out:    Sid Vicious      John Simon Ritchie (May 10, 1957 - February 2, 1979), better known as Sid Vicious, was an English punk rock musician and member of the Sex Pistols. He died from a drug overdose at the age of 21. Vicious, whose stage name was allegedly named after his friend John Lydon's (aka Johny Rotten) pet hamster, was born in London. During his early years he moved with his mother to the Spanish island of Ibiza where she made a living from selling drugs, although they later moved back and again settled in London. The nickname was also important because his group of friends, including Johnny Rotten, were mostly named John and because of his often vicious personality. Vicious was initially part of the Bromley Contingent, the group of followers and fans of the Sex Pistols that consituted the fashion avant garde of the early UK punk rock movement. He began his musical career as a member of The Flowers of Romance along with Keith Levine and Jah Wobble, who later went on to co-found John Lydon's post-Pistols project Public Image Limited. Shortly afterwards he was recruited to Siouxsie and the Banshees, playing drums at their notorious first gig at the 100 Club Punk Festival in London's Oxford Street. Described as being "the ultimate Sex Pistols fan", Vicious joined the group after the departure of bass player Glen Matlock in February 1977. Legend has it that manager Malcolm McLaren wanted Vicious in the band because of his looks and punk attitude, it was said "If Rotten is the voice of punk, then Vicious is the look." This "punk persona" counted far more than any actual playing ability. In fact Vicious was notoriously inept musically, and according to Jon Savage's biography of the Sex Pistols, England's Dreaming, most of the bass parts on the band's later recordings were actually played by guitarist Steve Jones, and at live performances his amplifier was often switched off. Reportedly, Sid asked Lemmy Kilmister from Motörhead to teach him to play bass. He said "I can't play bass" and Lemmy's reply was "I know". According to Lemmy, Sid Vicious was a hopeless student. Although "deep down, a shy person", according to the band's photographer Dennis Morris, Vicious was renowned for his violent streak. At the aforementioned 100 Club punk festival, a glass was thrown which shattered against a pillar, causing a young girl to lose her sight in one eye. Vicious is widely believed to have been responsible, but this was never proven. At the same event he also assaulted NME journalist Nick Kent with a bicycle chain and on another occasion threatened BBC DJ and Old Grey Whistle Test presenter Bob Harris at a London nightclub. In November 1977 Vicious met and soon after began a relationship with American Nancy Laura Spungen, who, legend has it, had come to London "to sleep with a Sex Pistol". Spungen was a heroin addict, and inevitably Vicious, who was already believing in his own "live fast, die young" mythology, came to share this dependence. Although deeply in love with each other, their often violent relationship had a disastrous effect on the Sex Pistols, with both the group and Vicious visibly deteriorating throughout the course of their 1978 American tour. Things finally came to a head at their concert at the Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco on January 14, when Johnny Rotten walked out of the band. Vicious also left shortly afterwards, and with Spungen acting as his 'manager', embarked upon a short and ignoble "solo career". By this time Vicious and Spungen had become locked in their own world of drug addiction and self-destruction. Contemporary interview footage shows the couple attempting to answer questions from their bed: Spungen is barely coherent whilst Vicious lapses in and out of consciousness. Vicious also came very close to death following a heroin overdose, and was, for a while, hospitalised. On the morning of 12th October 1978 Vicious awoke from a drug-induced stupour to find Spungen dead in their apartment at the Hotel Chelsea, Room 100 in New York. She had been killed by a single stab wound to her abdomen. Vicious was arrested and charged with her murder, although he claimed to have no memory at all of the previous night's incidents. Bail of $50,000 was put up by Virgin Records at the request of Malcolm McLaren, and in February 1979, a party was held at the home of his new girlfriend Michelle Robinson to celebrate his release. During his time at Rikers Island prison, Vicious had undergone drug rehabilitation therapy, and was supposedly "clean". However, at the party, he was able to obtain some heroin (supplied by his mother, Ann Beverley, herself an ex-addict), and was discovered dead the following morning, having taken a large overdose. Speculation has persisted that Vicious, unable to live without his beloved Nancy, took his own life. He wrote the following poem about her: You were my little baby girl,  I knew all your fears.  Such joy to hold you in my arms  and kiss away your tears.  But now your gone, theres only pain  and nothing I can do.  And I don't want to live this life,  If I can't live for you.  After his death, his mother phoned Nancy's mother to request that Sid be buried next to Nancy, and she declined. So late at night, Sid's mother jumped the graveyard fence where Nancy was buried and scatered his ashes over his beloved for them to be together for all time. Sid Sings, a solo album, was released posthumously by Virgin records. This was largely a collection of poorly recorded cover versions of rock-'n'-roll numbers such as "C'Mon Everybody" and "Something Else" by Eddie Cochran, and material by Iggy Pop and Johnny Thunders, as well as a rendition of the Paul Anka / Frank Sinatra standard "My Way". Striking footage of Vicious' performance of this song provides the closing sequence of Julien Temple's film The Great Rock and Roll Swindle. A fictionalised film account of the relationship between Vicious and Spungen, Sid and Nancy, was made by director Alex Cox in 1986.    Joey Ramone      Jeffrey Hyman (May 19, 1951–April 15, 2001), better known as Joey Ramone, was the vocalist for the legendary punk rock group The Ramones. Joey grew up in Forest Hills, Queens. His mother, Charlotte, encouraged both him and his brother's interest in music. Joey was a fan of The Who, among other bands. He took up drums in his early teen years and was originally the drummer for the Ramones. Upon realization that some particular parts of the band didn't work, he became the vocalist. Both Joey and future bandmates attended Forest Hills High School. After the skyrocketing success of the Ramones in the early seventies and throughout the 80's and 90's, their eventual end led to Joey's brief solo career, which included his album, Don't Worry About Me. Joey died of lymphoma on April 15th, 2001. On November 30th, 2003, Joey Ramone Place was officially named a new street in New York City. It is located alongside the block where The Ramones got their start at CBGB. His birthday is annually celebrated by many.   Joe Strummer      John Graham Mellor (August 21, 1952 - December 22, 2002), better known as Joe Strummer, was the co-founder and lead singer of punk rock band The Clash, and later The Mescaleros. Before forming the Clash, he played in the Vultures and The 101ers. The Clash were the most musically diverse and overtly political of the original English punk bands. Strummer was involved with controversial Anti-Nazi League and Rock Against Racism campaigns. He later also gave his support to the Rock Against the Rich series of concerts organised by anarchist organisation Class War. The Clash's London Calling album was voted best album of the 1980s by Rolling Stone magazine. After the disbanding of the Clash, he acted in a few movies, recorded movie soundtracks (notably "Love Kills" for the film Sid and Nancy) and experimented with different backing bands with limited success. Finally, in the mid- to late-1990s, Strummer gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called The Mescaleros. Strummer signed with the Californian punk label Hellcat Records, and issued a stunning album co-written with Anthony Genn, called Rock Art and the X-Ray Style. A tour of England and North America soon followed; sets included several Clash-fan favourites. Following the release of Global A Go-Go, Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros mounted a 21-date tour of North America, Britain, and Ireland. Once again, these concerts featured Clash material ("London Calling", "Rudie Can't Fail"), as well as classic covers of reggae hits ("The Harder They Come", "A Message To You, Rudie") and regularly closed the show with a nod to the late Joey Ramone by playing The Ramones' "Blitzkrieg Bop". They also toured Australia in 2000 with the Big Day Out concert series, to a very warm reception. Shortly before his death Joe Strummer and Bono of U2 co-wrote a song, "46664", for Nelson Mandela as part of a campaign against AIDS in Africa. Strummer had been scheduled to play at Mandela's SOS fundraising concert in February 2003 on Robben Island. Strummer died on December 22, 2002 in his home at Broomfield in Somerset, England, the victim of a heart attack. His untimely death at age 50 shocked and saddened a generation of fans to whom he had been an inspirational figure. He had especially been a massive influence on all of the members of Manic Street Preachers as listening to The Clash had inspired them to form a band. At the time of his death Strummer was working on another album, which was released posthumously in October 2003 under the title Streetcore. At the Grammy Awards in February 2003, London Calling was performed by Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Steven van Zandt, Dave Grohl, Pete Thomas and Tony Kanal in tribute to Strummer. In March 2003, The Clash were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to his music, Strummer was instrumental in setting up Future Forests, an organisation dedicated to planting trees in various parts of the world in order to combat global warming. Strummer was the first artist to make the recording, pressing and distribution of his records carbon neutral through the planting of trees. Many other artists such as Foo Fighters, Coldplay and Pink Floyd have followed suit and fans can visit the Future Forests website to buy trees to be planted in their favourite artists' forest. His 1975 marriage to Pamela Moolman ended in divorce. He married Lucinda Tait in 1995. He had no children with either wife, but had two daughters by Gaby Parker. Strummer also dabbled in acting, and had some major roles in some minor films.   Darby Crash     Darby Crash was born Jan Paul Beahm in December 1959. He had a very rough childhood, with his biological father leaving him, his mother being a devotee of Scientology and his older brother dying of a heroin overdose. In 1972 he set out to find his true father, tragically to find he was also dead. In 1976 he met Pat Smear and thusly formed Sophistifuck and the Revlon Spam Queens. They then changed it to The Germs. The Germs became a huge Los Angeles punk band, known for their chaotic live shows. Crash broke up the Germs (who once included future Go-Go Belinda Carlisle) only to die of a heroin overdose in 1980 on the same day that John Lennon was killed.. His legacy has carried on past the release of The Germs (MIA): The Complete Anthology, in 1993.   Dee Dee Ramone      Dee Dee Ramone, born Douglas Colvin (September 18, 1952 - June 5, 2002) was a founding member of The Ramones, a heavily influential punk band. He was the bass player with the band until his departure in 1989 (though he did continue to write songs for the band). In 1987 Dee Dee started a brief career as rapper Dee Dee King, and then formed The Chinese Dragons as well as several other bands. He reunited with The Ramones one last time in 1996. Dee Dee was found dead in June 2002, by his wife. A heroin overdose was the official cause of death. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood, California.   Ian Curtis    Ian Kevin Curtis (July 15, 1956 - May 18, 1980) was an English singer and songwriter, born in Stretford, England. Curtis lived most of his life in Macclesfield, England. Ian Curtis is notable as the singer and lyricist with the band Joy Division, which he helped form in 1977 in Manchester, England. Curtis developed a unique dancing style, which mirrored the epileptic fits he experienced late in life--so much so that at times audience members were unsure whether he was dancing or having a seizure. He also possessed an eerie baritone voice, which he used to great effect in the songs Joy Division created. As well as suffering from epilepsy, his life was plagued by depression. He committed suicide by hanging in his kitchen the night before Joy Division was to embark on its first American tour. Curtis' death led to the creation of New Order by Joy Division's remaining members. Curtis was cremated and buried in Macclesfield, with the inscription on his memorial stone reading, "Love Will Tear Us Apart." The epitaph, chosen by his widow Deborah Curtis, is a reference to Joy Division's best-known song. In the mid-1990s, Curtis' widow Deborah Curtis wrote Touching from a Distance, a biographical account of their marriage, in part detailing his infidelity    Text Courtesy Of urlLink  Wikipedia

      Today is indeed a day that's fitting for celebrations. I know that it has been quite a while since I've posted since I have a ton of work to do and that I also don't have access to the net on weekends, but nevertheless I'm back here spilling my guts to all of you whom I practically continue to bug with my rantings and loathings in life. As for celebrations. My father's celebrated his birthday just yesterday and as of 2:oo AM of June 20  urlLink Pinay Blood Rush 's gears have come into full swing as with the publishing of its posts here at blogspot.  I tried to look at the dictionary meaning for the term 'blood rush' to my surprise there isn't one none that I know of anyway. But instead the dictionary querry came up with the definitions of the two words namely: Blood & Rush Blood taken in the abovegiven context basically translates to this: temperament or disposition. While Rush given in light of what is written above could be defined as  the swift release of a store of affective force. And what does this mean basically since this is a blog this translate to the personal extasy that one experiences at certain points in their lives, and as some would say they are very few.  But I would beg to differ, perspectives may vary when one's life basically goes through the motions of routine and adheramce to the consistent patronizing of linearity, but one must come to grasp the idea that everyday is not as relative to the day before as it would be to the day after.  It makes your head itch doesn't it? Well it should I meant it that way so that we won't just go with the motions, though I know a lot of you who are reading this as of the moment are irritated with the notion that I am manipulating you to change your viewpoint of the world to one that is akin to mine. I apologize for that, but I guess the real reason behind all this is that I just want to remind all of you that each day is unique in itself and that we need to look at things in light of counting our blessings, and looking past the notions that contemporary society and the norm has set up for us, because we often busy ourselves with merely goingh through the flow of living our lives one day at a time, aimlessly drifting to the tide of fads, and routine we might as well secede from our humanity and forfit our free will for we are no better that robots. Now what does this have to do with 'blood rush'? Think about what you're feeling right now? Didn't I mention earlier that this is supposed to make your head itch? Well don't you get it? The itching of your head is basically the sensation of blood flowing to the cervixes and nerve impluses of your brain, due to a sudden rush of information.  Thus the itch is the immediate result of a rush of blood stimulated by the stuff that you're reading here and I say that to feel that itch is good because it reminds me of being human and that's exactly how I feel when I glanced at  urlLink Pinay Blood Rush  which is authored by my beloved Jeanie who for obvious reasons is way better than I am at translating her thoughts into words so if you have the time please do visit her blog by clicking here----->( urlLink Blog ) and try to ponder the thoughts written there in light of what I've written here.  Today is 12 noon here at the office and another 12 hours from now would be the dawn of another now think about this would you view tomorrow as another day to go through the sequence of going through the husstles and busstles of everyday living or would you welcome it as the beginning of the rest of your life?

       I once encountered a discussion of sorts as to how the people in that forum are disgusted by the 'jologs paradigm' and as the discussion took its I course I was also asked to give my take on it and this is what I came up with...  The idea of jologs doesn't disturb me much but it does alarm me. Since the safest deffinition of what jologs is what is prevalent in the twentysomething crowd. What alarms me is the fact most of the people who fall under the jologs crowd are so pretentious in the sense that they always try so hard to dress like, act or be like those people whom they emulate.  It sickens me everytime I see kids who try to rap like Salbakuta without taking seriously the sexual undertones of the lyrics. Or how kids try to dress up in like Ghetto kids, but the fact is that they're not African-Americans and they don't live in ghettos. Do you get where I'm getting at here?  We could also site poser-skaters as jologs in the sense that they copy the get-up of Pro-Skateboarders. They call themselves 'Thrashers' well in fact it is actually a title of a magazine. They wear skateshoes because Fred Durst wears them, not because skate-shoes have a good grip on the grip-tape of skateboards while those non-skateboarder kids who wear skateshoes don't even know what a griptape is. Another thing is that they make Steve Caballero, Chad Muska, Willy Santos and Tony Hawk look like they learned skateboarding in a day by wearing their shoes to look cool. Another thing that I can't get with those people is that they always try to wear skate-shirts what with the skate-shirts anyway? Non-sponsored skateboarders don't wear them so why should non-skateboarders wear them?  Another good example are the so-called 'rockers' I mean if they're really into rock music they should see it as a form of rebellion to what is accepted by the affluent society. So why is it all of a sudden turned into some exclusive cult of sorts. I mean you can't be called a rocker unless you listen to NU107, or read PULP, or put laminated pictures of your favorite band (preferably Slipknot) in your JANSPORT backpack, or wear TOP-40 t-shirts that has a picture of CHE GUEVARRA, or is it mandatory for rockers to regard METALLICA as the best band in the world, Or to form bands that fall under the ALTERNATIVE POP ROCK genre, or is it very cool if your band practices at ALBERTO's, or your band buys your tabs at BENJIE'S or at FADE TO BLACK. I mean rock and roll is supposed to be absolute disregard to what normal people call cliche. So why are you people making your own rules anyway.  I know I sound a little bit self-righteous but the fact is: IS THAT I'M ALREADY VERY PISSED OFF BY THE WHOLE IDEA OF CATEGORIZING AND DRAWING THE LINE ON WHO'S JOLOGS OR NOT!  I know the reasoning I that prevailed in what I've written above is somewhat shallow, but the thing is that however much I try to remove angst in my arsenal of emotions towards such people I still can't help but ask myself 'why are they so concerned with how people would look at them as if they're begging for compliments and praises for their purchased poser-rebellion?' I mean if they're really so into the counter-cultural niche that they claim to be part of they ought to start reconsidering their motives for projecting their rebellion as something that is cool. I cannot be fooled by such I grew up with kids whom I remember to once slam-dance to Nirvana's Smell's Like Teen Spirit, but as to my surprise they're also now part of the crowd who are now waving their sissy glow sticks to the deafening backbeats of techno in those sweaty meat-truck smelling places they call discos, I know better when it comes to posers and I am sickened by the fact that they're in abundance nowadays.

         Yesterday I got the chance to watch the Hey...Arnold! Movie with my nephew Arno on HBO its basically about Anold from the Nicktoon Hey Arnold! A fourth grader and his best friend Gerald as they set out to stop an industrialist from bulldozing their town. The movie is sort of interesting by the way but what really got stuck in my mind was this eerie post-apocaliptic scene there where  Mr. Scheck's (the industrialist who's intent was to bulldoze Arnonld town) face is projected on huge viewscreen strategically place atop an old apartment bulding monotonously saying "change is good." ala-Big Brother from Geroge Orwell's 1984. Too bad I can't find an image of that scene on the net, anyways the question is what does that have to do with my blog? The answer I guess is that over the course of last Friday and earlier this day lots of changes have been put up on my blog, for starters I've finally got my links portion posted and just this morning I've already finished posting and organizing all the links I've had in hand. Another is that earlier this day I've also finished activating my  urlLink bravenet  account so that I could generate this blog a free guestbook and hit-counter and I've already finished annoying everyone I know who's got an e-mail regarding the changes set on this site. And now I ask all of you who are reading this would you agree with Mr. Scheck's assertion that 'change is good'? If you ask me honestly I don't know, but if it would mean that the change is for the better I guess only time could tell if 'change is good'. By the way please do feel free to visit the links below as well as take the time to sign my guestbook. Thanks. God bless you all.

      I must confess I am currently losing a battle with the sleepy sensation that I am feeling right now and the coffee I am drinking isn't helping. Good thing though I have finally set up the links section of my blog though its not quite finished yet since I still have a truckload of links that I have yet to post but I hope that it'll be of good use to anyone who's interested with the stuff I've put up there. And by the way I must say that majority of the links there are Filipino stuff since I have yet to see such a comprehensive Filipino sight with an abundant source of information regarding the Philippine Underground scene and I hope that this site would be a good contribution. By the way if there's anyone of you who would like to have your site, blog, collective, org, church, band and the like please do keep in touch with me you could e-mail me the hyperlink plus a brief description of your site at m_3_5_b@yahoo.com Thanks.

       Rarely would I post stuff here that I didn't write myself but I suppose this one is an exception since this has made a lot of difference in my blogging especially here in the office since I am constantly palgued with the probability that I might get caught by my supperiors, so I hope this would be of worth to those who are forced to keep their blogging activities a secret. I found this from  urlLink Bulatlat.com  written by Pio Verzola Jr.   You could say I’m a mouse hater and a keyboard addict.   BY PIO VERZOLA JR. Northern Dispatch Posted by Bulatlat.com   The mouse as a pointing tool may have solved the problem of how to move the cursor or select objects more precisely on the screen – tasks that can be done with the keyboard, but often too laborious to be practical.   However, the mouse is somewhat difficult getting used to, especially for older people whose motor skills are no longer as pliable as those of children. Left-handed people also find it hard to use the mouse at first, unless they are lucky to get left-handed mice. (Actually, the mouse settings can be reconfigured to reverse the left and right-button functions. But how many of us know how to do this?)   There are other problems.   First, mice are terribly good at picking up dust. (All electrical devices build up static electricity, and so attract dust, lint and other small particles.) The dust builds up into crust-like layers on the mouse rollers. After a while, you may notice that your mouse moves are jerky and sticky, and the cursor hard to position on the screen.   If so, don’t easily rush to the computer shop to buy a replacement. It won’t take you 15 minutes to remove the small manhole-like cover on the mouse underside, take out the ball (don’t lose it!), and use a cutter blade to carefully scrape off and blow out all the crusty particles inside.   Second, a mousepad takes up additional desk space. Not a big problem, really, but if you have a small desk like mine, with stacks of papers and books competing with my coffee mug for extra space, the mouse can only maneuver in cramped surroundings.   If there was another, more intuitive and more ergonomic pointing tool – that is as cheap as the mouse, of course – we should go for it. Some people seem to find the touchpad (that 2” x 3” rectangular surface found in laptop keyboards) easier to use. Others use an optical mouse, which solves problems #1 and #2, but the device is more expensive. I remember having the privilege of using a touchscreen back in ‘96-97, but that’s even a hundred times more expensive. I suspect a much cheaper, more portable (maybe even wearable) version of the touchpad or touchscreen will reach the markets – in five years’ time maybe.   So, in the meantime, while we are stuck with the combination of keyboard and mouse, might as well learn some tricks about still being able to use the computer when the mouse refuses to cooperate. The idea is to use the keyboard shortcut equivalents. Actually, in my case, I tend to use these keyboard shortcuts more than their mouse point-and-click counterparts.   Just a sample listing, for us to see the utmost usefulness of keyboard shortcuts:   1.     You boot up the computer, and then realize that the mouse is not working. So that you can change the mouse, you need to first shut down properly. But you can’t use the mouse to do it. The keyboard solution: Press ctrl-esc to activate the Start menu. Press U to select the Shutdown menu. Select the shutdown option, then press Enter. In the more recent generations of keyboards, there is also a Start key (the key with the Windows logo between the Ctrl and Alt keys).   2.     In the same manner, you can also use the same quick Ctrl-Esc + P (or Start + P) key shortcut to display the Start > Programs menu, then use the Up or Down Arrow keys to select the program you want to run, then press Enter to run.   3.     Want to close some windows quickly? Just press Alt-F4 once per window you want to close.   4.     Want to minimize all open windows, so that you can display the whole desktop? Press Start-M.   5.     Want to quickly shift from one window (one running program) to another? Press down Alt, then press the Tab key as often as necessary to select the icon of the program you want to restore or maximize.   6.     In almost every Windows-based program, if you press the Alt key, focus goes to the program menu (typically at the top row of the screen), and thus you are able to select among the various menu items by just using the Up, Down, Left and Right Arrow keys. To focus back on the program’s work area, just press Esc.   7.     In almost every Windows-based dialogue box, you can move the highlight cursor from one item to another by pressing the Tab key as often as necessary. When the highlight cursor is on the item you want, just press Enter to activate.   8.     Most if not all programs that rely on mouse point-and-click operations are also thoughtful enough to provide the equivalent keyboard shortcuts. If working with your program requires you to type a lot of words and numbers on the keyboard, you will soon find out that some commands are easier to invoke via keyboard shortcuts rather than their point-and-click mouse counterparts. For example, to save your document in Word, you will use a mouse to point at the File menu, select the Save command, and click. The keyboard shortcut is much quicker: Ctrl-S.   9.     In Word, you can print a list of the most useful shortcut keys. Press F1 (by the way, pressing F1 in a Windows-based program will display the Help file of that program). On the “Type keywords” input box, type the words “print shortcut keys.” Just follow the dialogue box until you have the printed list. You can also do this with the other programs you often use.   10.   Okay now, for a little exercise. Run your Photoshop, or Photopaint, or whichever you use as your image-processing software. Then find that key labelled PrtScr or PrtSc on the upper right corner of your keyboard. Press it. Then, select File > New on your image program. When the new blank image file is displayed, press Ctrl-V and see what happens. There are just some things you can do with a keyboard that you can’t do with a mouse.   Happy keying!

      I don't know if you people have noticed but I think there is a bit of parallelism betwine Avril and The Sex Pistols mainly for the reason that they serve as fashion models for some studpid fashion fad that corporate know-it-alls conceptualize to be cool so that they could earn more money from the allowances that the parents of fashion kids give to theit children.  From the very start the Sex Pistols were a joke in the punk movement, mainly because they were created by Malcolm McLaren to model his line of fetish clothing which he sells in his fashion botique called 'Sex' the same shop where the band was named after. Their stab at dissing the Queen and their use of anarchism was just a scam to stir controversy and to promote the band. So many lives were ruined by The Sex Pistols namely: Sid Vicous who serves as a poster boy for anti-social nihilism that one would associate with jaded messed up youth culture. Another one was that of television host Bill Grundy, who the same person who gave the BEatles their first break on national television, was the same person who was ruined by Steve Jones' uttering of the word 'Motherfucker'.  Unlike the CLash whom I respect more, they recently lost Joe Strummer by the way if ever you're intrested.  But sad to say what sucks more are still the kupaw bands that dress up like skateboarders who model over-priced skate shoes, lousy purchased rebellion T-shirts and give Che Guevarra and Bob Marley a bad name. Plus the utter stupidity of wearing a Guerilla Wear T-shirt that says guerilla, but has the picture of a tank, which has nothing to do with guerilla warfare by the way because tanks are used in this military tactic that the Nazis used in World War 2, which is better known as Blitzkreig.  But who am I to correct them? So all I can say is that kupaw bands suck mainly for the reason that they manufacture their anger out of petty things and that they exploit social issues to make money out of youth rebellion.  I mean what's so rebellious about singing against the corporate system and how it abuses you, and still model addidas shoes (Fred Durst I'm looking at your direction) or how rebellious is the wearing of 2000 peso plus shoes, 300 to 400 pesos worth of T-Shirts, Rasta hats and Studed bracelets? I know a lot of people out there might get offended but if would really take the time to think of it what's wrong with that it might seem that there really is something downrightly wrong about the rebellion the're preaching.  So if you're one of those new school punk rawk kids out there I suggest you check out this lyrics from No Use For A Name... ..."Sitting Duck" I read the morning paper, someone had just died In big bold letters so it comes as no surprise Im looking at a story 'bout violence, a word from a lawyer in his defense this time we got the jury by the throat I turn the television on to get away a quick reminder that we have to swallow every word they say learned another lesson in history, written like a murder and mystery to me it's just another way of disguising the past Fear is not the way to make it work and be as one it's too late the damage has been done so fly your flag and make your statments, hold on to your pride and live your life for others that have died This is the end of what we know, Where do we go? don't look for solace in some shallow ignorant late night talk show think about your problems every now and then discover that we're limited in the end sometimes you've got to close your eyes start thinking for yourself

       urlLink     emo game rules!!!   It serves as an existential retribution for people who have been so bored or otherwise been disenfranchised with all forms of consumer based nonesense and whatnots of the present MTV generation. Where else could you play a game where you could get nasty with Mandy Moore or get the chance to kill Kelly Osbourne, Creed, Simple Plan, New Found Glory, The Used, Fred Durst, Skelletor, Courtney Love etc, or get the chance to kick facists like Hitler, Saddam, and the most definitely evil and war mongering G.W. Bush, or get the chance to team up with you childhood heroes like Hulk Hogan, Mr. T, The GI Joe and not to mention Bob Saget.  Moreover there are at least four games available on the site and they are as follows:  urlLink Emo Game 1  where The Getup Kids get kidnapped by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith and its up to Cedric Bixler of At The Drive In and the gang to save them.  urlLink Alkaline Trio Vs. Hell  The band dies and goes to hell right after meeting Rose McGowan, God gives them a second chance at life provided that they kill He-Man's nemesis Skelletor.  urlLink Emo Game 2  Continuing the saga of emogame one features our heroes battling Enrique Iglesias & the cast of Friends.  urlLink The Anti-Bush Game  The title says it all I guess, plus as a bonus this game can also be downloaded and played offline provided that your PC has a Macromedia Flash 5 installed in it. All in all the game site never fails to give a sense of power to its players especially if you've experienced being called a geek, square, nerd, queer etc, this serves vengeance for those who've deprived you of justice. Plus there is also this cool name that emo song portion on the Get Up Kids game where the show is hosted by Cobra Comander of GI Joe. It also has this cool soundtrack from Alkaline Trio, The Anniversary, Hot Water Music, Reggie & The Full Effect Among others. Another thing about this game is that it makes you stand out from the Ragnarok rippoff victims when you play it at Internet cafes.

       Nowadays its no longer that special to hear a punk band playing covers of old pop music, New Wave and folk but and come to think of it, way back when I was still in college it is a very rare phenomenon and that even playing punk rock doesn't merit at that time since almost everyone I know that listens to rock music would easily dismiss punk as some sloppy musical genre that desrves to be shelved in the history books, they'd rather listen to Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slapshock, Cheese and all those other growling moronic jocks at that time than listen to simplistic punks who could get by with three chords and a hook. Going to cover songs I remember it a couple of years ago I got into a forum in  urlLink indiefilipino  discussion concerning cover songs that was then when I realized that a lot of the music that I love are mostly cover songs, and anyways here's what I posted there:  I love seeing and hearing you punk bands playing classic punk anthems.   For example  Blink 182 played GenerationX's "Dancing With Myself" in the Five Years on the Streets sampler of Vagrant Records Face to Face played lots of classic punk covers from the Ramones, Fugazi, The Pougues among others in their Standards and Practices album, but I really loved their take on the Descendents' "Bikeage" on their Big Choice album . Same goes with MxPx's cover of the Ramones' "The KKK Took My Baby Away." on their At the Show live record. Or Greenday's cover of the Who's "My Generation" from their Kerplunk album or The Offspring's cover of "I Wanna Be Sedated" again from the Ramones. As well as that NoFX and Rancid split CD where they covered each others song I really find that stuff cool.  As well as those cover songs done by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Bodyjar's take on SImon & Garfunkel's "Hazy Shades of Winter" could be noted as a good cover of a classic song.  Same goes also for the following covers of these artists:  Pennywise (Surfin USA, The Beachboys) from the Music For Mother Ocean Compilation vol.2  Mr. T Experience (Is There Something I Should Know?, Duran Duran) from The Duran Duran Tribute Album  Riverfenix (Ordinary World, Duran Duran) from The Duran Duran Tribute Album  7 Seconds (99 Red Balloons, Nena) I forgot the title of this album...  The Lemonheads (Mrs. Robinson, Simon & Garfunkel) from their Its a Shame About Ray album  Reel Big Fish (Take on Me, A-Ha) from the OST of Baseketball  Save Ferris (Come On Eileen, Dexy's Midnight Runner) from  The Sex Pistols (My Way, Frank Sinatra) from the OST of The Great Rock n Roll Swindle  Mest (I Melt With You, Modern English) from the OST of Not Another Teen Movie  A New Found Glory (The Glory of Love, Peter Cetera) on their From Their to Your Stereos  Goldfinger (I Love You More Today Than Yesterday, Spiral Staircase) from the OST of The Waterboy  Smashmouth (Why Can't We Be Friends?) from the OST of Baseketball  Buck-O-Nine (Pass the Dutchie, Musical Youth) on the Barfly EP  Down by Law (500 Miles, The Proclaimers) from their punkrockacademyfightsongs album  The Hippos (Always SOmething There to Remind Me, Naked Eyes) again I forgot the title of the record  The Muffs (Kids In America,) from the OST of Clueless  Ghotti Hook (Walking on Sunshine, Katrina & The Waves) from a mixtape that I got from my friend  NoFX (Vincent, Don McLean) on the Survival of the Fatest compilation of FatWreck Chords  Hi-Standard (Kid's Are ALright, The Who) which I downloaded from the Internet  Counting Crows (The Ghost in You, Psychedelic Furs) from the OST of Clueless  What I don't like is when metalheads (i.e. Metallica,Megadeth,Biohazard, Slayer) cover Ramones, Sex Pistols, Stooges, DRI and Misfits songs and then they putt some complex guitar riffs on them thus destroying the classic back to basics element of the original song.

       As I reflect on it extreme legalism is one of the most dangerous things that causes other Christians to become a stumbling block to their young fellow Christians so this is just a word of encouragement to those Christians who've been mistakenly branded as worldly by their fellow Christians.   How could you stay so stagnant  You said you’ve learned the truth  Yet you live your life in bondage  To utter fear and guilt  If the truth shall set us free  You said so yourself  Then why does you soul shiver  Like a death row convict?  Why won’t you look beyond this cheap trick  Of the legalistic scribes and pharisees  That still follow the Levitical creeds  We’re above the law because we’re under grace  Walk not in slavery step into the light  Its not the rituals and traditional cannons  That set you apart for life everlasting  Its the grace of God that makes us heirs to his kingdom  Why won’t you look beyond this cheap trick  Of the legalistic scribes and pharisees  That still follow the Levitical creeds  We’re above the law because we’re under grace  Its not a talk of religion or of denomination  Its not about Mary and the Pope who’s in Rome  Its not about being good or being sincere  Its not a point system and we could be sincerely wrong  Its all about having a relationship  With the Father in Heaven  By claiming the victory of His only Son  Who died for our sins and rose up on that great Sunday  Why won’t you look beyond this cheap trick  Of the legalistic scribes and pharisees  That still follow the Levitical creeds  We’re above the law because we’re under grace

       The origins of this Life Is Trying song came from my old-school Pentium 2 Dell PC at my old office, the melody eventually came out after I handed the lyrics to Cedric Buenviaje who composed the song's basic chord progression which was later on developed by Laixander Naguit and Mark De Guzman.   We stood face to face  But I can't see you  Look the same way  As you stared down  Awkward attraction A case of infatuation A melodramatic feeling Of love and affection  I can't speak the words That I long to say to you My mind always splits in two Everytime I look at you  Maybe this is love Or am I just strung out With a chlidlkie respones To the nearness of you  You look so beautiful And I look stupid With my stupid hair And my rundown clothes  Side-winded love songs And basement poetry Are all I can give In thought and in theory  I can't speak the words That I long to say to you My mind always splits in two Everytime I look at you  Maybe this is love Or am I just strung out With a chlidlkie respones To the nearness of you

       I'm really looking forward to this weekend since not a single one of them has been quite much of a dissapointment for the past few months. Anyways I hope I'll find the time to workout on the development of this site's link portion as well as in the overall appearance of it. Another is that this post is also a cause for celebration since non bloggers can now post their comments since louie of louiboi.blogspot taught me how to finally activate hy haloscan account which I have also installed at Pinay Blood Rush which is good because I've heard a lot from people who are visiting the blog who are interested in posting their comments but cannot. By the way I hope you aren't tired of browsing at my quiz results since I am a self-confessed addict of proving my intellect online so by the way just see them for yourself.   By the way please visit by monday because I'll be posting the best stuff (I think) that I've posted for the month of July since I've just established this 'tradition' last month.      You are AS LOVERS GO.  You're in love with someone who either has no clue or is overly cautious. It's not that they don't like you -- they're either scared or unaware, so either reassure them or let them know.   urlLink     What Saves The Day song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You are Hold. You love/loved someone very much, you find yourself lost without that person. However, you are a deep thinker and often find yourself needing to be alone. You are smart enough to know that life is beautiful but all you want more than anything is for that someone to love you.    Hey Dude! Start your horse and come along, you're one happenin' dude. Don't get lost out on the range.       urlLink Which "Saved By The Bell" Character Are You?       You are "Cute without the 'e'"   According to the   urlLink Which Something Corporate Song Are You?

       People have said that pictures speak more than a thousand words and that it also serves as ones window into the past. Though I have written the stuff here previously here at this  urlLink link  the only problem is that I still don't know how to post pictures during the time I posted it.  I'd like to post it then again in light of the fact that I've been long itching to post these photos of Life Is Trying in all its incarnations so that it'll give you some ideas as to what the pictures are about anyway. Another is the fact that I'm really finding it hard to write stuff recently my head doesn't seem to be functioning as it used to, I guess I just haven't gotten a lot of rest recently.  But despite of all that nonesense I'm currently in the process of doing another (sort of...) overhaul for the links portion of this blog so I hope you'll keep posted another is that I'd like to urge you also to please do find time to sign the  urlLink guestbook  located below of visit the   urlLink photo album  because I've just been notified by its host that it might get removed because it doesn't generate enough internet traffic.  Thanks and I hope you'll find the post below interesting and worthwhile.    (Click on the thumbnail to see the entire picture.)    urlLink       So what do you want to know?  To start with Life Is Trying is in a very devious way a completely uncomplicated group. They were at their time just a bunch of single-minded punk rock-loving dudes who just so happen to have the endowment to write singular thoughts and ideas that are translated into seductive songs of love, hate, longing, anarchy, mortality, revolution and belongings all of which basically germinated of the very heart of suburbia which is conveniently located at 35-B Malingap St. or M35B as they would like to put it. All information above surely gives you somewhat of an idea as to who exactly are these devious uncomplicated punk rock group once were, certainly it would apparently give you the impression that they are one of the most secretive band to have come around in recent times, yet at times they could be the most surprising.  > What is this all about?  This is a history of substance, apparent success and of moving on with our lives; a biography ghosted by the group themselves, the very best of irrational rock music, a question of identity, confessions cut with dry wit, a deflecting adventure in thought and space, a question of style, a parting of ways; the end and the beginning; a celebration of alienated consciousness; a sincere sellout; a voyage into the present; a full stop; a semi-colon; a question mark. Part punk. Part emo. Part indie. Part rock. And part whatnot. It’s the start to stop start; from QHS to PUP, from teenage innocence to young glory up to their apparent discharged college life anxieties, and to the eventual parting of ways caused by the sudden realization of Chuck Baclagon that his band mates no longer share the same passion and dedication that he once shared with them; from movement to movement; from the formulating and the shifting of priorities; from fate to wasted fortune; from Jaded to The Sane Side of Insanity to M35B to Life Is Trying and to the obscure nothingness of their wasted existence; from Jarme Mondragon to Mark De Guzman; from Christopher Villarante to Cedric Buenviaje to Reginald Unigo to then again Cedric Buenviaje; from Laixander Naguit’s guitar journey from Jim Croce’s broken chords to Billie Joe Armstrong’s distorted palm-muted power chords. It’s the putting together in a perfect new order the light and heavy public and private lazy and intense calm and frenzied concealing and the revealing of the hit and miss songs of Life Is Trying.   urlLink      urlLink      > What was the question?  Here’s one answer. The anti-social ranting of Holden Caufield the infamous protagonist of J.D. Sallinger’s The Catcher In The Rye; Punk rock, emo, indie, ska, hardcore, straight edge, crust, rhythm times and technological agility and new wave music and computer mistakes and dynamic sensations and noise filled suspension and beside themselves and many meanderings and shy purpose and lyrical caress and remote vision and great crossing and clashing and trembling and splintering of the mind and a battered acoustic guitar and the sound of feelings and melodies falling from the sky or blasted to your ear by a resounding distorted electric guitar and shadowy beauty and grave ecstasy and inexhaustible restlessness and looking for life and stoned perfectionism and imprisoned perceptions and a low key engagement with a world of perplexities and uncertainties in which one can hope at best to achieve the small satisfactions a kind of innocence that surrounds the enigma and what was the question?   urlLink      urlLink      > Who are Life Is Trying?  We may never know.   urlLink           > Where are Life Is Trying?  They’re at home I presume. Or they are flying across the ocean. Or they’re right in the middle of a jamming session inside a cork-filled box called a studio infamously owned by the notoriously grumpy grouch that has become an institution of Philippine rock music commonly known to your average twenty-something rocker as ‘Mang Jun Alberto’, which is basically their home from home, their flight from flight; the only place where for a brief 60 minutes in their life they take the center stage; step into the spotlight to indulge themselves and their guitars into a spiritual experience that cannot be expressed into words; an hour of feedbacks, static hissing and rapid drum rolls. Or they’re still waiting for their drummer to show up for their gig that’s scheduled two hours from now. Though there are some certain hints that I could give you to point to you where they are right now: One is teary eyed with his tears dripping on his bony hands as he types his thoughts on a battered keyboard comforted only by the fact that he has given himself to God's lordship and has finally found a partner whom he can share his life wholeheartedly with. Another is spending his time studying some boring stuff about engineering and the likes. There is also one who’s presently happy at home with his two kids and his pregnant wife. Another is contentedly reading the Good Book memorizing every passage with the conviction displayed only be the Filipino television evangelist that we have come to either love or hate. And another is presently head over heels with the fulfillment of his dream to be actually involved in the making of a comic book. But wherever they are right now, they are in their own special way telling right from wrong, and indulging in slight extravaganzas.   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink   urlLink        > Where do they come from?  1) The late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and a pinch of the year 2000 and beyond or so they say. 2) The North; the north of everywhere including the North. 3) Greenday, The Cure, MxPx, Blink 182, NoFX, Rancid, The Offspring, Saves The Day, The Ramones, The Clash, Pennywise and Dashboard Confessional; Anarchy and tackiness, machines and glitter, apathy and sympathy, war and peace, ordinariness and extraordinariness. 4) The Sane Side of Insanity. The badly drawn prototype that would become one of the (sort of…) longest incarnations that is centered on the intellectual and musical collaboration between Laixander Naguit and Chuck Baclagon, and the apparent drum playing of Jarme Mondragon who still doesn’t know how to play drums at that time which was also hallmarked by the irrevocable departure of their friend Christopher Villarante as a member of the musical ensemble and as a friend of the band. 5) M35B. The most devastating imaginative rock group between Greenday and The Cure. There are some saying that all of the curiously naïve, deeply biased and fundamentally instinctive music made up of Life Is Trying, their puzzling centerlessness and their edgy incompleteness, the question mark that surrounds their motives, reputation, presence, absence, it all comes from trying to escape their very self-righteous notion that they have the in their feeble minds that they are an underground super group that never was. 6) The tortured frustrations of Chuck Baclagon to prove himself as someone who isn’t a loser to the mediocre world, which utterly fell into oblivion with the realization that Laixander Naguit and Cedric Buenviaje never really shared the same love and dedication that he had for the band and to his vision of sharing his tortured rhymes to the unsuspecting public who would rather listen to cheap senseless rage manufactured by hordes of dreadlocked, Addidas wearing, hip-hop infusing, rap-influenced, metal-zone guitar effect dependent corporate rock bands who retail their ‘packaged rebellion’ on MTV Rockd’.  urlLink      urlLink      > So what’s the point of all of this?  Nothing. Other than the fact that this is a very biased description of Life Is Trying as a working unit and as a set of friends who suddenly lost the innocence in the music that they make, mainly because of the fact that they’re no longer geeky high school kids who can’t even find the courage to talk to girls and to face a crowd without saying “I” and “we”. This is the frustration of Chuck Baclagon materialized into words, to give himself poetic justice of the emotional turmoil that he felt when his band fell apart with the shifting of interests and priorities and the constant assaillance of the Freedom Bar concert organizers, backed up with the realization that there were really people who would take the time and effort to really go there, pay for the ticket and order a drink or two to watch them play their music and sing their hearts out, and that for the first time in their long lived existence as a band they would finally get paid for doing it. But sad to say his other comrades would rather go out of their way to pick up lousy discs of mp3s containing downloaded punk rock songs at nine o’ clock in the evening. And how it all doesn’t matter anymore because as Greenday once put it: “nothing good can last.”    urlLink      urlLink     urlLink

       I haven't got the chance to blog recently and the sad things about it is that I've had a lot of fun and meaningful things going on for me since last Saturday sad thing though is that these days are dangerous times for me to go blogging well anyways I was supposed to write about those stuff that happened and the things I learned during the weekends sad thing though is that I can't seem to get my thoughts organized. For the meantime the post below is something that I wrote yesterday and it basically speaks for itself. By the way check out the new online test results that I posted below. Thanks.   I know that I am not to complain and that I am not in a bargaining position here but based on my observation I cannot help but think that contemporay professional life as in "IT" employment that come in the guise of business process outsourcing (bpo) has sort of not made me think that I am no more different than cattle who is required to just merely meet a given quota. Same way that cows are required to produce a specific amount of milk where later on they'll be lead into their final fate as burgers. And I really think that I am just a commodity in this job but nonetheless I'll still continue to endure this for the meantime, because I know that there's more to this job than meets the eye and that this is just a part of God's work in building my character.    Bye for now. By the way check out the new posts at pinaybloodrush. Thanks.

        Yes. After a couple of weeks the Iraqi militants that have taken custody of Angelo Dela Cruz has finally released him and that goes to show that our prayers have not been in vain and also of how such a single man would be used to a change of foreign policy here in the Philippines, may those who prayed and those who have engaged in the militant assertion of opposing our country's support for US-imperialism look at this event as a signal to rebuild from the ashes of a tragedy that by God's grace ended in triumph.     On a sadder note, for those of us who grew up in the 1980s some of us might have heard of the name Falco. If in any case you don't know him he is more famous for this song called 'Rock Me Amadeus', which goes like:  Rock me Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus  Rock me Amadeus   Well anyways this song was one of the very few songs that I could still remember from back then when music videos can only be watched on Casey Casem's America's Top  10, Video Hit Parade and Video Hot Tracks and it was the video of this song that I could still remember as one of the the very few videos that were made just for the fun of it and for that matter made it cool, and I could still remember me imagining myself as one of those party crashing people composed of mohawked punks, goths, easy riders, freaks and ghoulies marching over to this silly sort of medieval tea party, chanting: 'rock me Amadeus'. And that when I was still in high school I'd purposely watch MTV Classics just to catch a glimpse of that video as well as other notable videos from The Cure, Madness, The Clash and Human League simply because I would want to relive the happy music of my childhood courtesy of my older brother's  Hitachi tape deck.   Falco died last February 6, 1998 due to a car accident, just as I was about to finish high school. This requiem may be late to serve as a tribute for such a now considered New Wave/New Romantic artist that have influenced groups such as New Order, Electronic, The Petshop Boys and The Bloodhound Gang (they even had they're own version of Rock Me Amadeus). But I know that it is not yet too late to say that I am grieved by the fact that a part of my childhood died also, but rest assured that the legacy of his influence in the way I enjoyed music as a kid would never be forgotten.

      Tasteless jokes could be quite offensive. If you don't believe me then try going to this  urlLink link , and see for yourself whether its funny or not. I don't know about you people but I really think that there's something wrong about the stuff that abounds on the web today.  I cannot fully comprehend how some sites, specifically rotten.com are allowed to propagate such slanderous statements against anyone who ever dared to stand up for making the world better. More over it also gives veneration to such tastelessness, so as to reserve numerous portions of their site for the sick art of making someone else's tragedy as a source of one amusement.  And it has recently come to my attention that the biography section has been spreading lies and slanderous statements against a lot of people, and thoughtlessly hurling insults at a lot of prominent people not because of the evils that those people have done but because of the controversy that the actions of such people have stirred.  The list covers wide number of people from Popes, piliticians, revolutionaries, serial killers, pornographers, televangelists and even deities.  I won't even touch their entries on the other portions but instead I'd merely concentrate on the site's item on religion where it makes fun of almost every organized system of faith and has subjectively given us the impression that belief in a God is irrational and fanatical.  Just imagine how they'd deal with the idea that they do not even examine the context of their hearsays nor do they try to focus on the theological constructs of doctrines that the religions they're making fun of, nor do they even backup their argument of the inconsistencies about the Gospel accounts of the Bible with a critisism of the Biblical contents of their supposed arguements, I know this was meant to be fun for some but the sad truth is that fun is also relative to the object of who you are making fun off, I am a Christian and I must admit that I feel sick of all the references that this site has used for Jesus and of how their apparent counter-thesis against Christianity wouldn't even amount to merit in answering the question that why is Christianity still here if it were a lie (one could argue that such is the same with Communism, but the sad thing about it is that Communism has indeed change the world in its image but so did Nazism but did it outlast Christianity? the same goes with every other existing ideological systems and fads not to mention the idea that in almost every country there is a thriving community of Christians whether it be under persecution); and why would there be countless Christian martyrs in its 2 thousand years of existence; nor do they counter the reality of the changed lives that have been touched by the Gospel of Jesus' death and ressurection on the cross.  One could also see that such statements also has no substantial proof of Scripture to point out their supposed inconsistencies and that they never even bothered to study religous contest with their argument of Judaism's misinterpretation of the prophesied messiah.  But despite all of that we still merely conclude that maybe they do not know of that maybe they just lack knowledge but still I find it insufficient because those people have the knowledge of typing html codes that eventually turn out into the complex site that they have now, but why is it then so that they could not even try of attempt to verify their illogical juxtapozing of Christianity at the very least convincing to the intellect?  Another thing that makes me very dissapointed with the site is the fact that it blasphemes and 'name-calls' Jesus and it deviates His deity and humanity by lining Him up to the same level of Anton LaVey, Alister Crowley&nbsp; and David Koresh.  So what are we as Christians to do of such sites?  Simple have nothing to do with it. (2 Cor. 6:13) That's really the very reason why I wrote this because we need to understand that as Christians it is our equal responsibility to live our lives in reverence to the God that we worship and that we are no longer part of this world that thrives on malice and controversies.  Let us examine the things that we see on the net on the basis of this questions:  Does this speak of my identity as a Christian?  Does this glorify God?  Does this edify the Church and does this encourage me in continuing in the faith?  To end it like us all to keep in mind that as Christians we are supposed to shed light on the darkness and on the context of this is on the abundance of sham on the Internet, make it your goal to use your time on the Net as a means to spread your Christian testimony to the secular society of the world wide web.  Fight the good fight of the faith.1 Timothy 4:12

      Just yesterday me and Jeanie went out to visit Cubao after a long time of absence in the area.We visited it to shop for second hand clothes where we were able to be there just in time for its 50% off sale on all garments.We later on visited Ali Mall which basically no longer has the shops that we used to visit and that it has mostly clossed down a lot of the shops there that have in their one way played their parts in our lives once upon a time.But all that changed when we visited the new Shopwise located at the former building of fiesta carnival and well it also reminded me of the fondest childhood memories I've had at the Carnival when I was a kid, but at the same time I've also found joy in it now that its been converted mainly because of the fact that as me and Jeanie explored the place we were able to see a lot of happy families that are there together doing their grocery and we both had a lot of memories to share to you with regards to our memories of going to the grocery with our parents when we were kids.And I am glad that in these times that there are still places that are accessible to parents and kids where they could enjoy each other's company without one of them compromising their fancies. And that its nice to know that more people are benefiting from the conversion of the old carnival into a grocery since before the carnival moved to its new location&nbsp; (just a few blocks away from the old one), the place was a mess and that the only ones hanging there are scumbags and other people and that it no longer makes itself safe for kids to go to so I guess now more people are benefitting from it, but it could also be considered that a lot of childhood things and that other people have lost income in the conversion of the place, and for that I have mixed emotions about its conversion and also on the present rennovation of the Cubao area.So again if it were a question of whether change is good I guess for those of us who grew up with the old Cubao we better visit it ourselves and see the difference.

      I don't know about you but just this Saturday I got the chance to a dear friend of mine to the Saturday service of VCF, where later we also had the time to get together with other friends to eat pizza.And after a while we and another friend that I was discipling were about to start our regular Bible study the dear friend that I invited suddenly came into a frenzy of excuses and reasons why he shoudn't be in that place with us at that moment to cut the story short he was sort of frightened when I grabbed the Bible from my bag so as to start the Bible Study, so I just let him leave me and my other friend to our study, and though I said it that its okay, I must admit that I was offended not because of the fact that he left but because of the fact that he so easily dismissed the action to be by his standards I guess 'corny' or not his thing.And I cannot help but marvel and at the same time feel sorry for such since it they blatantly dismiss the Gospel without any hesitation of their refusal to heed it and yet chose continue to live in the confusion of their lives, the Bible does not speak of a special formula or of criterias and standards and of initiations it basically just speaks of the fact that we are all bound to die someday and that our present decisions have eternal consequences and that we are separated by sin from God who in the first place created us, but at the same time gave us the freedom to have 'free-wills' knowing that one way or another we'd end up making wrong decisions, and that the Bible also tells us that our wrong decisions could be justified in the eyes of God by giving us the gift of salvation, which has no secret formula other than to believe in our hearts that Jesus died and rose from the dead to rescue us from our previous wrong decisions.Now is that so hard to comprehend but then again, there are other invisible powers that blind our minds. This is just a simple case of having to relate to a good new and the bad news, but sad to say we'd rather just choose to listen to the bad news and dismiss the capability of the Good News to restore us from the pits that we are dwelling in right now.So how does this then apply to the event that I mentioned earlier, well very much this is just a part of God's working in me so as to build character and to elevate my dependence on Him to a higher level, and for that reason I hope that everyone who's read this, who've ever encountered harsh opposition of the Gospel message be encouraged to pray that the Lord will open the eyes of the hearts of those whom we are trying to reach out and also to admonish ourselves to continue in contending to live a life that can backup what we preach. May we all continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord.Thanks.

      &nbsp;I know not a lot of us (I included) rarely get the chance to read other comic books other than Spiderman or Superman, but in a sense we have also just been negligent to the fact that apart from super hero comics the genre of comics does not only span the realm of superheroes.  And for people like me who have been rummaging through the sale bins of P50 comics at Filbar's there is that wonderful line of comics under the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics.  Titles like Sandman, Hellblazer, Swamp Thing, Animal Man, Doom Patrol, Shade The Changing Man and The Invisibles have been great influences in the penchant that I have in writing. I know a lot have seemed to ignore these titles since they're don't have covers done by Todd McFarlance, Rob Lifefield, Jim Lee and the like, and this was way back in high school when everyone that I knew who read comics was so into Spawn, WildCATS and all those other muscle bound freaks in so-called "enhanced" comics I was then contented to reading obvious DC books like Batman, Robin, New Titans and Giffen-Era JLA.  But all of that changed sometime in 1995 while I was rummaging through the sale bins of Filbar's (that was a time when you could still buy a comic on sale for the price of P15) I was by stroke of luck able to grab a copy of Skin Graft, Children's Crusade, Shade and Doom Patrol, and I guess that was it for me I've come to abandon the super-hero genre altogether and replaced it with the habbit of scouring through old issues of Shade, Doom Patrol, Sandman, Swamp Thing etc. on sale bins, and on grocery store magazine racks. Where after a while of collecting I was able to amass quite a number of Vertigo comics that would qualify to be called a collection.  Being a long time reader of comic books there are quite a number of writters that I've respected for their craft.  Among them are:  Neil Gaiman, of Sandman and also the creator of Tim Hunter from the graphic novel Books Of Magic, the character that JK Rowling ripped-off for Harry Potter. (I'll resserve another post for my point regarding this); Pete Milligan of Shade The Changing Man, and Enigma; Marv Wolfman, (creator of the Teen Titans, and author of Crisis On Infinite Earths), the team of Keith Giffen &amp; JM DeMatteis (the comedy Justice League); and John Orstander (creator of Oracle from Birds Of Prey).   But above them there were only two who seemed to have written at an intellectual level that is more superior thus proving the point that comic books were no longer just kids stuff.   Those two were Alan Moore and Grant Morrison.       For a lot of people Alan Moore wouldn't even remind them of something but to be certain his influence has gone way beyond the bounderies of comic books. A lot of us have watched LXG, The Road To Predition, From Hell and The Swamp Thing. And factually speaking he wrote all of them. Another war the fact that the Vertigo Imprint was created by DC in honor of him.  That would certainly merit him as a genius.  But for me the reason that I see him as a genius is because of this single Batman story that he wrote way back in 1988 called The Killing Joke, a very introspective story about the relationship of Batman and the Joker, which basically explains that to some degree both of them are the same and that it proves a point that it only takes one bad to drive someone into insanity. But apart from that the reason also that I loved the comic was the fact that Moore was the one who made the Joker into a villain that's worthy of the Batman, this is not the Joker that one would associate with Cesar Romero from the Adam West Batman show. Another is the fact that this story is of groundbreaking relevance which up to now affects the continuity of DC Comics, this is where the saga of Oracle started though it was not Moore who created her this was the starting point wherein John Orstander would pickup the broken body of a Barbara Gordon that was shot in cold blood by the Joker and afterwards taken pictures off to drive Comissioner Gordon insane and then left to be crippled for life. And later breathe life into her by turning into a cyber vigilante that maintained close ties with the SuicideSquad and a host of other heroes. And all that could be credited to Alan Moore.   Another was Grant Morrison.       Has anyone every heard of Grant Morrison?   Maybe I better re-phrase the question, has anyone ever read a copy of any of the following:   Animal Man      Arkham Asylum       The Invisibles       JLA       New X-Men       The Filth       St. Swithin's Day      Next to Alan Moore I think he's a heck of a genius. I loved the way that he wrote Animal Man and Doom Patrol. I haven't got the chance to read Arkham Asylum which he did with Sandman's Dave McKean. But that Invisibles series that he wrote was absolutely thought provoking, that comic changed the way I used to think about a lot of things concerning politics, culture and society.       And during the course of collecting there was this one comic book that got my head to tick: The Invisibles a saga about a team of anarchists terrorists who supposedly dwell in a battle to liberate the world's minds from an age long conspiracy that stretches all through out history and to my surprise the author of the comic was the same one who've written other comic books that I've also come to be a fan of, it was Grant Morrison a Scottish writer imported by DC to write for their mature reader's line of comics. Now considered a genius since he's brought the "big guns" back to the Justice League and has remade the X-Men to his own image (which is sort of like how he used to write Doom Patrol).  But before all that there were just a few who've really taken him seriously. And I am glad that I was one of those.       I can't afford to buy his comic books now but given the chance I'd gladly read them, but reality check, we all know how expensive comic books are here in the Philippines, and I think kind of sucks.

      There must be something darn wrong with the airconditioning system here because it has been a week that I've been constantly whining about how the coldness here seems to be freezing my fingers and not to mention putting certain parts of my body sleep, well anyways the reason I posted this is that I'd like to show you a picture taken here from work and I hope you'll find this post not a waste of your time. Here it is:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      It's quite comforting that just yesterday I finally was able to have my salary, since I've been living in such a low budget for quite sometime now, and its again nice that I got the chance to have a nice meal with Jeanie, Meg and Aga. Where we shared a pizza meal at Pizza Hut, where as we enjoyed each other's company they Jeanie, Meg and Aga got the chance to brainstorm about their planned youth camp for their cell group in Adamson.  Where later as they left to stroll on the mall I was also able again to have my weekly Bible Study with Aga which got on hold for the past two weeks due to our hectic sched but it was nice to see that we are back on track again, so on we went with the study, I shared to him about the doctrine of salvation which centers around Christ's death and ressurection on the cross of calvary, which was very timely since I've just finished Paul Little's Know What You Believe where I got a far more deeper understanding of the above said doctrine. Then again as it have been on the past it was as far as I'm concerned another working of the Holy Spirit since I was again able to shed off my natural introvert complex as I discussed the topic with him as well as I got to explain and expound on answering his questions pertaining to what I am teaching which I am not so as good at most of the time. And it was nice to know also that Aga has also been doing his own personaly study with regards to church doctrine since we got to talk about the 95 Theses of Martin Luther that led to the Protestant Reformation. I belive that there are more meetings to come where we'd both be learning something new from the Scriptures. After the Study me and Jeanie boarded this old taxi cab with a driver whom I later came to learn was a freelancing news correspondent to DZRH who also thought of sharing his anxieties towards his wife with me and his most unlikely proposed solution, to get a new wife via asking me for celphone numbers of "chicks" that he'd be textmates with which I find kind of creepy since he's a man way past his testosterone overload for crying out load, but then again who am I to judge him on that, and apart from it I also learned that he is somewhat colorblind since he finds it hard to distinguish whether it is stop or already go in the traffic light not unless he'd see other cars overtaking our cab. But nevertheless the ride was pleasant and I was able to get home in time to watch NYPD Blue with my father and got the chance to help Jeanie on the phone in writing a memo for her friend. So I guess yesterday ends well and is worth writing about.  I hope you've found this piece sort of enlightening. THanks.

      Again this is another post about the coldness of this office.  My hands are freezing and I want to leave this place but the time keeping system of this office forbids me and I just posted here because then again I need to distract myself of the coldness that I feel I might need to wear mittens tomorrow.  Oh and by the way if in anycase you open this site and there's a pop up window saying that you should vote for Chuck's Blog please do find the time to do so. Thanks.

       I know that this would hurt a lot of those counter culture buffs but with regards to the vanity promoted by Pulp Magazine what is written here must be said.  First of all I am not a fan of Pulp, their magazine is too expensive for my budget. Plus I think they're so into hyping up artists or music fads among others, not to mention their lousy reviews of records that can only be bought at this overpriced record bar called Tower Records which I find to suck because they always try to cash in on kids who want to hear stuff that aren't released here in the Philippines. I don't find their articles worth reading in a sense because, they at times  inconsistent and they only write about the NU 107 rock-culture. I hate their use of explicit photographs becasue it makes the struggles of women who want to empower themselves seem like a sham, another thing is that I find the photograph of people there with mutilated if not decapitated body  parts of dead animals kind of disturbing. ANother thing is that what is it with the oily skins of everyone who's photograph was able to grace  its glossy pages? Call me biased or whatever but I really think that a majority of mainstream magazines in the shelves right now lack substance and lacks stuff that are readable.

       As most of us knwo there is such a line that divides artists between pros and cons with regards to their view towards piracy this is of course in the context of the music industry while most of us have already heard the side of those who are against piracy spearheaded by Eminem, Metallica and almost every other pop artist in the mainstream side of the music scene few of us have ever took into consideration the underlying aspect of those who are for piracy.  And I'd like you to take these following considerations with regards to piracy.    On The Artists' Side   Music piracy is not really an issue from my point of view. The real issue behind music piracy is the idea that artists believe that their song is private property hasn't it occured to them that by the act  broadcasting, performing and introducing their songs they have already denied the exclusiveness of his or her song to himself, the song now become a part of the lives of his listeners it no longer caters to his or her own it becomes somewhat of a soundtrack to someone else's life. And to claim that it is his own and that people should pay him for introducing his music to others is a betrayal of his purpose as an artist. Another thing is that why are they submitting themselves to the greed of record labels who merely want to milk them of their talents. Lastly my observation regarding this issue is that a majority of the artists that are crusading against piracy are pop stars that merely invests in their  aesthetics, voice and pressence to make up for their lack of skill in composing their own songs.   Has Anyone Ever These Questions?  Q: Why do punks create bootlegs of their music?  Q: Why is everybody whining about the imminent death of the so-called  music industry?  Q:Why do you buy pirated music?  Q:Is the money gained from the royalty of one's songs the only means  for a person to pay the expenses for his work?   A: Punks create bootlegs of their music to spread what they have to say  regardless of the profit.  A: The idea about this is that music has already ceased to exist as a  form of self-expression in the affluent society. The tem 'music  industry' itsel conotatiates the idea that music is a lucrative form of  business and that songs and artists are merely commodities.  A: check the other entries for answers,  A: Has anyone ever heard of DIY punk ethics?   By definition DIY punk ethic refers to the idea of 'doing it yourself', i.e., making and promoting music without major record label backing, and without any great level of "selling out". A popular slogan of the DIY movement is "DIY not EMI", an explicit rejection of the major label of that name.  For more on this click  urlLink here    Would Music Die If The Industry Goes Bankrupt? Whose Benefit Does The Anti-Piracy Campaign Benefit?  What I don't get with those who are against piracy is that if it would  ever be the cause of the music idustry's demise it would not mean that  the passion to make music would die, since it is only the industry that  is killed the industry is just an institution it rests on something  that is tangible, while on the other hand the passion to write music is  somewhat of a drive which basically rests on the mind which cannot be  tarnished not unless you kill the physical body, and I guess what I am  trying to say here is that would it be a complete loss if the music  industry would die? I mean mainstream music that is being pirated in the past  3 years could be regarded as crap anyways I mean isn't  Britney,Aguillera, the twentysomething monster rock acts, the silly balladeers, the  sexist rappers, boy bands, girl groups among others are the ones that  dominate the pirated shelves? But despite the fact that they are pirated  they still earn millions and that their pressence still flood MTV and FM  radio stations and their loyal following still buy their original stuff  as well as some pattented apparel, and there are a number of their fans  that cannot afford their original merch and perhaps if they could they  would have bought the original but their monetary standing doesn't make  that a reality for them so think of piracy as the mainstream music's  charity to the people who love them but cannot afford their charge.  And so what if these mainstream blokes lose their jobs I guess it would  be stupid for them to use up all their money on their silly bourgoise  lifestyles. Wouldn't it be nice that again the music industry would have  a fresh new start on the grassroots and that it would be a free for all  to every aspiring musician, performer and composer.  What also saddens me is the fact that the government spends too much  time on destroying piracy to go to the extent legislating laws, creating  legal and police arms to fight it all for the protection of foreign  corporate record companies who in the first place are dictating what we  should listen to. The money spent on that could have been used to  reinforced existing projects that develop legitimate needs of the masses.  And come to think of it this phenomenon is basically just an example of  the chaos theory at work since the whole music industry is so to well  organized anyways.

      We talked about God When you fixed the PC That I was using One December afternoon Then I asked your number And then your e-mail address That's how I text you And shared my life with you A few weeks ago We sat on a bench To waste our time You laughed as I spoke You told me I fulfiled a wish We drank on the same cup of iced tea I find you kind of cool What is it with you That makes us worlds apart You fix computers  I write letters  No common thread to bind I hate the thought of losing you Because I still relish the tought Of me and you side by side Slowly walking in the mall Or when we both enjoyed That elevator joy ride one time You're sight's still vivid When you waved goodbye And cracked a smile As I descend from the escalator But I don't know What has happened  When the weeks  Have come and gone You looked so tired Don't know if you noticed The times I gave a smile Maybe you're just busy But I just can't see The whole point of this You just ignore me Like I am nothing But a carbon based particle Now I try so hard To keep my pain and angst All to no one but myself SO I hope you got to cook  The recipe you asked for Alt Print Screen that's how we started Please don't let it be a Control Alt Delete

      An hour from now I'll be going out of the office and I am amazed that I haven't died of hypothermia yet its so cold most of my body feels numb and I can't seem to feel my arms, and that is why I'm exercising my fingers to rid my arm of its stiffness.  That's it I guess, I still have a lot of work but I just need to say something about the coldness and to exercise my thoughts and not to mention my fingers anyway thats it for the meantime I guess.

       I took this test just this lunch break at  urlLink http://www.politicalcompass.org/  it tells of my personal political stance on certain issues if it were to be represented in the form of a compas.  Below are the stuff that explains the concept of the political compass.  I find this really interesting.    About The Political Compass      If we recognise that this is essentially an economic line it's fine, as far as it goes. We can show, for example, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung and Pol Pot, with their commitment to a totally controlled economy, on the hard left. Socialists like Mahatma Gandhi and Robert Mugabe would occupy a less extreme leftist position. Margaret Thatcher would be well over to the right, but further right still would be someone like that ultimate free marketeer, General Pinochet.  That deals with economics, but the social dimension is also important in politics. That's the one that the mere left-right scale doesn't adequately address. So we've added one, ranging in positions from extreme authoritarian to extreme libertarian.    urlLink Click here for diagram    Both an economic dimension and a social dimension are important factors for a proper political analysis. By adding the social dimension you can show that Stalin was an authoritarian leftist (ie the state is more important than the individual) and that Gandhi, believing in the supreme value of each individual, is a liberal leftist. You can also put Pinochet, who was prepared to sanction mass killing for the sake of the free market, on the far right as well as in a hardcore authoritarian position. On the non-socialist side you can distinguish someone like Milton Friedman, who is anti-state for fiscal rather than social reasons, from Hitler, who wanted to make the state stronger, even if he wiped out half of humanity in the process.  The chart also makes clear that, despite popular perceptions, the opposite of fascism is not communism but anarchism (ie liberal socialism), and that the opposite of communism ( i.e. an entirely state-planned economy) is neo-liberalism (i.e. extreme deregulated economy)    urlLink Click here for the diagram  The usual understanding of anarchism as a left wing ideology does not take into account the neo-liberal "anarchism" championed by the likes of Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman and America's Libertarian Party, which couples law of the jungle right-wing economics with liberal positions on most social issues. Often their libertarian impulses stop short of opposition to strong law and order positions, and are more economic in substance (ie no taxes) so they are not as extremely libertarian as they are extremely right wing. On the other hand, the classical libertarian collectivism of anarcho-syndicalism ( libertarian socialism) belongs in the bottom left hand corner.  In our home page we demolished the myth that authoritarism is necessarily "right wing", with the examples of Robert Mugabe, Pol Pot and Stalin. Similarly Hitler, on an economic scale, was not an extreme right-winger. His economic policies were broadly Keynesian, and to the left of some of today's Labour parties. If you could get Hitler and Stalin to sit down together and avoid economics, the two diehard authoritarians would find plenty of common ground.  Following is where you stand on our political compass. Thanks for visiting us and be sure to tell family and friends, It should spark off some lively dialogue, and you may discover that you didn't know them as well as you thought you did.    My political compass   Economic Left/Right: -4.00 Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -3.85      International Chart A diverse professional team has assessed the words and actions of globally known figures to give you an idea of how they relate to each other on the political compass.    urlLink Click here for the diagram

         News reports yesterday showed violent dispersal in Plaza Miranda.   Police from the Western Police District shoot water canons and draw battons at the protesters campaigning for the pullout of Filipino troops from Iraqi soil, for the sake of Angelo Dela Cruz. It is a saddening thought that such rhetorics would again be responded with state violence since from the newly elected Macapagal-Arroyo Administration that had previously dispersed protesters that questions the legitimacy of her election to president.  A number of the rallyist are presently detained for being so-called "threats" to national security, while a host of others including a woman are undergoing treatment for injuries that were inflicted when police and para-military forces seiged the protest yesterday.  It could be said that the course of action taken by the police yesterday reflects the real stance of the government regarding its policy on supporting the United States and its imperialist interests, and it is also sickening to think that then again it has been evident that the state is using goons to attack/disperse those who do not share its sentiments in policy making, just like the same method once used by the same regime on street clearing operations of the Metro Manila Development Authority, footages of the dispersing units showed armed civilians holding batons and stricking it on the unarmed rallyists.     But it could also be said that such action of the state is what led to its sudden change of heart with regards to the pullout of our troops from Iraq, and that this could be said that the value of the parliament of the streets has again showed its worth at affecting the weak reactionary state. At the cost of the militants' harrasment a change of policy was acheived and not to mention the progressive forces involved in the campaign has also won the hearts of the Dela Cruz family who also lambasted the police's violent response to the protesters' solidarity to their plight after the government has failed to its earlier promise to resolve the crisis last July 11.  As of this morning the Philippine Government has finally decided to finally pullout the Philippine Contingent out of Iraqi soils, according to new reports that were given by CNN and Al-Jazerra. While it is also said that the militants will be releasing Dela Cruz any time soon by the Islamic militants.  We may look at this as a victory for militant assertion then again to contribute for pro-people mandates within the framework of a reactionary bourgiose regime.   But the fight against the injustices of US imperialism still continues and that it is also worth keeping in mind that there are other foreign nationals that are still held by the Iraqis and just yesterday 2 Bulgarians have been beheaded. Let us share this victory of uncompromising assertion for a just cause be shared to inspire others to give out their voice of opposition against imperialism. So that terrorism would no longer be the only visible means of airing out greivances among the oppressed.

       I was kind of wondering since I grew up in the 80s and all I'd just like to give you some of the observations that I've seen from old-school Filipino movies the observations by themselves are still quite limited please do find time to add your own obesrvations, read on...   You'll definitely know if its a Filipino movie if it has:   A song and dance number where the lead character sings ala-Sound of Music in places like Luneta Park, Balara and Parks & Wildlife. (e.g. Maricel Soriano's Diyaryo Bote Garapa and Chichay's Lola Basyang)   IF there is a part where its characters stumble unto a haunted house filled with ghoulies thay look more comedic than scary. (e.g. Any Tito, Vic and Joey Movie.)   If there is a scene where the love team runs towards each other with the sunset as their background thus making their silhouttes appear ala-Voltes 5 on the end part where the Armstrong borthers run towards their father. (e.g. Any Gretchen Barreto movie or any Tina Paner and Chris Villanueva love team movie.)   If there is is dramatic scene where the action brings a bag of pancit to his street children friends, take note of the pancit placed in a brown paper bag. (e.g. any Ace Vergel and old-school Robin Padilla flick.)   If ever the action star always wear a leather jacket, just remember that this can only be seen in the Philippines. (e.g. Any Bong Revilla flick)   If the movie has a gay comic relief character namely Roderick Paulate, its definitely a pinoy movie. (e.g. Petrang Kabayo)   If the big villain boss of the movie calls his goons "mga bata".  Don't forget the profound dialogs also. (e.g."Hindi ako kumakain ng Bigas sinasaing ko muna.")  In case you're wondering who is the gratest pinoy actor of all time there can be only one answer...Bomber Moran. check any flick that has a  hoodlum you'll definitely spot him on the movie.   But the gratest signature of a filipino flick is the idea that every protagonist in its movie tries his or her luck in politics, and funny thing about it is that they win.

       I hope these two pieces written here would be of value to those who are into the last post that I placed regarding emo. Thanks.   point 1 What Genres - Sakin siguro more or less anything that has to do with punk rock ayos sakin. WHether it be old-school, emo, ska, hardcore (not that Slapshock immitation), crust, oi among others cool sakin.  Ok din goth pero yung not related sa metal na goth yung Cure-type di Type-o-Negative.  Saka indie in vein with Blur, Stereophonics among others.  Cool din Christian music tulad nina United Live, Hillsong, Matt Redman, DC Talk, Delirous, Sonicflood, Vineyard saka Passion.  Last din mod saka raggae kool din.  Ayos na po ba yon?   point 2 On Punk Rock's Contribution To Metal Music  - Yes indeed metal is one of the most complex styles in music today. But  we must also understand that it is also because it is somewhat of an  amalgam of other genres that fused metal with their own specific genres.  Like how Slayer gave such imolation as to how punk rock influenced them  specifically DRI a Houston band that developed the term crossover by  infusing Judas Preist riffs with traditional LA Hardcore punk.  Or how Metallica paid homage to Discharge an early 80's British punk  band that crossed over to thrash metal territory along with the  Exploited.  Or how Industrial and black metal is one one way or another influenced  by such gothic bands as The Sisters of Mercy.  Or how Megadeth's screech is influenced by Johnny Rotten's Sex Pistols.  Or how the Ramones paved the way for Motorhead's fast paced in your face beats.  Or how these so-called Nu Metal bands musical style could be traced to Aerosmith's collaboration with Run DMC, or how they could be also traced down to Tool, Biohazard and Faith No More.  I suppose you already understand what I'm trying to say here.  I don't know if what I'm saying here really makes sense but I can say that I like punk rock more than any other style in music.   point 3  On Contemporary So-Called "Punk" Rock Or Power Pop To Be Exact - believe the term power pop started with that cheesy classic rock group called Cheap Trick, which basically laid the foundation for that.  Though I suppose the power pop genre originated with those late 60s garage bands like the Sonics, Dead Boys and MC5, which later on progressed into punk rock where in time the Ramones in the USA and the Buzzcocks in the UK eventually laid groundwork for a more melodic movement in punk called pop punk which basically became the trademark sound of such bands  as the Descendents, Screeching Weasel, and all those other punk bands that played melodic songs.  The Simple Plan, Busted or Avrile Lavigne phenomenon was for that matter in one way or anothre could be blamed on Blink 182's incorporating of Travis Baker former drummer of the ska-punk band Aquabats. Who  basically replaced Scott Raynor Blink's origial drummer and played drums for their album Enema of the State which is basically very different from the  original Blink 182 sound that has this edgy, fast and somewhat emoish structure similar to that of MxPx and Face to Face's Big Choice album more over its drumbeat became somewhat more complex with the addition of slow breakdowns and peculiar works on the cyballs making the song appeal also to those who are into pop music plus it also had this big  mindless hit called "All the Small Things".  Which as of this moment makes any song from Sum 41, Simple Plan, New Found Glory, FenixTX, Good Charlotte, Lit, and American Hi-Fi remind me  of Blink 182's All the Small Things in fact it got so big that even early 90s punk band The Offspring tried to get into that power pop-punk bandwagon with their song "Want You Bad" in their Conspiracy of One album.  So I suppose all this Simple Plan, Avrile Lavigne mess is all Travis Baker's fault he may be a good drummer but he also produced a legion of pop bands who augment poser-punk aesthetics and anti-social packaged rebellion on their songs.   Please do forgive me for the angst.

       It has recently come to my attention that Emo is sort of coming into the limelight after more than two decades of its existence and it saddens me that a lot of people who consider themselves emo, really don't know a thing about emo nor do they really care about going deeper to what emo really is.  Just recently I've come accross these two responses that I wrote below pertaining to questions that were posted at an internet discussion board that I'm in pertaining to emo and I hope these responses that I gave to those in the discussion would be of great contribution and enlightnenment to those who'd care enough to read what emo is all about.    On Bossa Nova, Indie & Emo  I'm not that much into Bossa Nova and Indie but I'm definitely into emo, in fact I have an emo band.   So in this aspect let me just share a thing or two about emo, I guess emo was popularized by the hardcore icon Ian McKaye and his post Minor  Threat outfit Fugazi.   Basically its roots can be traced down to Punk Rock and the HArdcore punk scene in the 1980s its all aboutemotions... I'm not saying that punk rock isn't all out... it's just some punk bands have humor and happy go lucky attitude... I guess you don't see hc kids singing happy thoughts and all of that... right? so I think hardcore is related to emo.  The thing also is that its not called emotional for nothing which in turn brings out the beauty of it helps people to keep in touch with their  sensitive side.   Good examples of emo bands are Fugazi for starters, Rites of Spring, Embrace, Dashboard Confessional, Farside, Texas is the Reason, etc... and there's also this new wave of emo... aptly called screamo... I guess they're emo but a bit harsher in the tonsils...  ________   On the Difference Of Emo & Indie   One must understand that emo and indie are both archetypes of music that are not just derived from a single genre, but both are brought out of the amalgam of various styles that incorporate it into some sound that we so happen to label.  To start with, indie like alternative music is not a distinct style of music but just like this site is a myriad of various influences that is beyond a basic definition, take for example the bands that supposedly fall under the 'indie' banter: What sound or subject matter do they have in common basically?  Does Pavement have anything in common with a group like the Stereophonics, by all means no! Pavement sounds more like country music in contrast to Stereophonics reminiscent Mod sound. Or is there a common sound denominator between Beck, Buffalo Tom, Husker Du, My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, Super Deluxe, and Superchunk? I'm not quite sure, but  certainly we can distinguish their sound from one another as opposed to the sound of traditional established genres like punk rock and metal which  has this very signature sound that establishes an artist to fall under it. Like how an average rock music listening bloke would carelessly mistake Simple Plan with New Found Glory because they both sound alike or Deep Purple with Led Zeppelin.  But as opposed to indie music, the only common denominator that they have is that they all adhere to the DIY ethics that was popularized by  such proto-punk groups like Velvet Underground, MC5, Television etc. And another thing is that indie from the word itself is an abstraction of the word 'independent' which basically connotes something that is in a way exclusive or for a marginal group of people only as opposed to 'pop'  which is derived from the word popular and can be defined as something caters to people of all walks of life. It is somewhat like the post-modernist art movement in music so to speak.  While with 'emo' basically it is basically short for the word emotion or emotional, it is basically a relatively new movement in punk which was spawned out of the first wave of hardcore bands like Ian McKye's post-Minor Threat band Rites of Spring and later on Fugazi, which basically dwells with honest to goodness emotion induced music as opposed to Acid  Rock which is LSD induced that basically is because of the fact that McKye is one if the forerunners of the Hardcore Straight Edge movement which advocates intellectual and physical freedom including freedom from chemical substances like drugs, alcohol and GMOs.  But in the context of the emo music that we hear from the likes of Saves the Day, Promise Ring, All American Rejects etc this brand of emo could be traced back to Jim Enright's Sunny Dale Real Estate, whose other famous member is Nate Mendel of Foo Fighters and Jawbreakers one of the first bands that popularized the use of octaved chordings and  Descendents like singing.  But as of now emo has become sort of a huge phenomenon in music similar to the New Wave and Grunge music exploision in the past which has paved  the way for numerous groups that fall under the emo repertoire without any distinct sound but as a general rule I guess emo is basically about  passion, passion that is way beyond the Johnny Rotten like snarling of the word 'destroy', or Kurt Cobain's boredom rhetorics. It is basically about singing your heart out in reference to certain things, events, beliefs or relationships and the like without any signature sound though some of the artists under emo still have draw their song writing  structure to its punk rock roots. Whether it be about relationships (Dashboard Confessional, Bright Eyes), principles and ideologies (Snapcase, At  The Drive In) Religious Faith, (Juliana Theory, Further Seems Forever) Growing up and coming of age (Saves The Day, Weezer, Getup Kids) and other stuff that makes someone's head or for that matter heart tick it all connotes to something that is very intricately personal to the artist who is singing the song it is sort of like an artists way of giving  poetic justice to whatever emotion they've felt during the time that they wrote the song.  Another thing I wrote something up there about alternative music not being a genre I'd just like to take the time to correct that error that most of us (even I) make in using the term. Basically alternative music is a collective term that defined music that were off the Top 40 radar during the 1980s, songs from bands whose music were released on small record labels or played in college radio stations. But by the end of the 80s most of those college kids have already graduated from college and  tried to make their way to the 'real world' but a handful of them tried to established their own record labels, radio stations, music magazines, direct their own music videos etc. And one of them is Steve Albini more popularly known as the guy that produced Nirvana's Nevermind album, which by the as early as 1992 have brought the Alternative Music  phenomenon which at the present are collected in CD Compilations like Alternodaze and Contagion. I know that most of you already know this but I just can't stand the way so many people blatantly speak of alternative music as something as if it were interchangable with modern pop rock like those who still consider Matchbox 20 or Linkin Park or Korn or Incubus as alternative when well in fact they aren't since you average bloke sings about them and you'd even see some teen idols singing tham in medleys at noontime shows, when in during their time it was way  unimaginable.   I hope I have made any sense in this thing that I wrote, because now that I'm looking back at it I can't help but feel like such a self-righteous geek but I hope this has been of value to whoever wants to know. Thanks. God bless.

      Oops... Again mainstream media has fallen prey to the trap of misinformation, broadcasted. Such was the case when 10 pm of July 10, 2004 the ANC reported live that Angelo Dela Cruz was already on his way to a hotel room after being released by the militants that captured him. But then again its just to darn good to be true, that its spell of disinforming the warring public has even afflicted major broadsheets except for Today. I just arrived home at around 11 PM when the news of the 'apparent' release of Dela Cruz was broadcasted live by ANC as a breaking news, and after hearing the said report I was glad because I have been proven wrong in lacking faith in the government to resolve this crisis but dissapointment came when I got home on the following Sunday of July 12, apparently the supposed relative of Dela Cruz who got the alleged call from President GMA was unverified and in fact false, and that the present state of Dela Cruz was still unkown to the government and that the only success reached since Friday was that the deadline to pull out the troops were extended for another day, but as of this moment I am still in a haze of heresay since I've yet to know the outcome of this crisis since I've no access to the television. But still I'd like to express again my dissapointment on the media for its lack of competence in carrying out the task of reporting their so-called breaking news and for giving false hope and assurance to those that care for the plight of Dela Cruz. And again I'd also like to express such disgust over the present administration's reactionary response to the present plight of Dela Cruz under the hands of those who presently have custody of him. We must understand that for whatever reason it may be the government still stands proud to be hand-in-hand with the USA on their supposed war against terror, but the sad thing is that we as a 3rd world country is also being an imperialist in itself by milking out the absence of Saddam by bringing our corporate contractors to monopolize on the task of nation building and for encouraging our citizens to go there to work. Let the task of nation building be in the hands of the Iraqi citizens and moreover let those work be given to the deprived Iraqi people. Lastly we must understand that our voice of opposition of such interests perpetrated by the US and its allies, must be heard and that we must come to recognize the fact that US hegemony does not translate to democracy, the whole idea of foreign pressence in Iraqi soil is immoral and is in violation of a whole lot of treaties, international laws and agreements that have been legislated in the context of the post-cold war global spectrum and such actions merely promote injustice which violate human and devine law.  Continue to contend with the struggle against imperialism in all its forms.  Unite-Resist-Refuse US/RP Bullying Rights Over Iraq. Boycott yellow journalism in all its forms. Contend for the people's right for journalistic integrity from the corporate media. OUR UNIFIED OPPOSITION IS OUR COLLECTIVE ACTION

      I can remember the time when I was in elementary when I'd be happy come wednesday since it signals the approaching of the weekend. Though it wasn't that way last wednesday I could still say that this weekend (again) was worth writing about. Saturday was one of the coolest days though I didn't get to spend that much time with Jeanie, but still it was day where I was able to put my life to praise God and spend time to hang out with my friend Laix who to my surprise has really taken the initiative to go to the youth service that we attend on Saturdays, which basically led to a realization that God gave me to continue to persevere in my walk with Him. After the service we both went to Tandem to pay a visit to our punk cohorts there where we got a chance to see of cool new records at Radiation Area. And later on we had a glass of ice water in Ever wherein also I begged for a glass of ice at the Jollibee there. Which we later topped by walking from Recto to Nagtahan where we got to talk about stuff concerning our faith. Where later on I got the chance again practice bass guitar at church which ended quite fine, and I was also cheered by the fact that we now have a saxophone player with us. But the downside there was that I lost all my money that on my way home I walked all the way from Anonas to Sikatuna which measures about 1.5 kilometers. WHen I got home I was greeted with the apparent release of Angelo Dela Cruz whom I dedicated a post earlier. But the apparent serenity ended when a fire broke out a this house accross the street where it took 3 hours for the firemen to put out. Which ended up with me being late for the praise & worship at church I arrived and they were already half-way through the songs that we practiced the day before and I was quite ashamed of myself since it reflected the fact that I wasn't giving God that much of a priority in my life, but all went okay again when I attended Sunday School where a lot of things concerning the doctrine of repentance was cleared to me thanks to the discussion given by Pastor Lito & Pastor Jong who were there filling in for the absence of our teacher Kuya Ponch. Later I had lunch at Jeanie's house where I also spent the afternoon to eat qiquiam and mojako chicharon while talking with Jeanie and her cousin Tutoy, and also she popped my zits that same afternoon and to top it off I got a chance to take a 5 hour nap. And later on I ate supper watched an HBO movie and had a latenight talk with Jeanie and again slept. Which eventually led me to sitting here right now.

       It's been quite a while since I've posted here and to start with a lot of things happened to me just this weekend which I would try to give you an account of at a later post which hopefully I'd be able to accomplish. But for the meantime here's a statement worth reading:   ONWARD WITH OUR STRUGGLE  FOR P3,000 ACROSS-THE-BOARD SALARY INCREASE!   	Fare prices have already gone up. In a span of 6 months, oil prices have increased 6 times already.  But, after three years, the salaries of government workers remains pegged without a centavo of increase.  Under such dire economic condition, it is only just to ask for immediate relief and salary increase.  	Our campaign for a P3,000 across-the-board salary increase started in 1999 when the monthly basic pay of a salary grade 1 employee is P4,400 and the cost of living for a family of six is P13,674.60 a month.  YEAR SALARY GRADE 1 (MONTHLY PAY) COST OF LIVING (NWPC-DOLE) COST OF LIVING (IBON) 1999 PhP  4,400 PhP  13,674.60 PhP  14,239.50 2001 PhP  4,840 PhP  15,900.30 PhP  15,317.10 2004 PhP  5,082 PhP  16,860.00 PhP  16,975.50 (Feb)  	A 10 % salary increase was given to government employees under the Estrada administration in response to our collective mass action in 1999. In 2001, another 5% increase was put in to effect in July of that year.  Under the Arroyo administration, not a single cent of increase was given to state workers.  	Before the May elections, Mrs. Arroyo promised to certify a bill allowing a 10 % salary increase if she’s elected as president.  This increase is not acceptable to us. Besides being meager, this tends to increase the disparity of salaries among employees and it doesn’t address the need to increase the salaries of the lower rank and file employees who needs the increase more urgently.  	The usual official response to our clamor for salary increase is that it would only worsen our budget deficit and cause inflation.  We must not forget, however, that government workers working under extreme economic hardship have always been a steady source of taxes. Studies also show that corruption and lavish spending mostly done by higher officials account for about 40% of the depletion of government fund.  It is also important to note that the P52 billion needed to fund the salary increase is not even more than 20% of the yearly payment by government for foreign debt. 	 Year NAT’L BUDGET Debt servicing (interest) Debt Servicing (principal – excluded in the budget) Military /Defense 2002 PhP 742.0 B PhP 185.9 B PhP 172.1 B PhP 38.9 B 2003 PhP 811.5 B PhP 230.7 B PhP 195.0 B PhP 40.6 B 2004 PhP 804.2 B PhP 325.0 B PhP 270.7 B PhP 43.2 B  10 % DI SAPAT, P3,000 DAPAT  As the union of employees in the DSWD, we declare that we are not in favor of the 10% increase.  What we want is the P3,000 across-the-board salary increase.  We call on our members and fellow government workers to continue our just and legitimate struggle.  The key to our success is our collective strength and action!  	On July 14, 2004, let us join our fellow government employees in a nationwide mass action to show our unity for this call.  We ask our chapters to coordinate their actions with other government unions in their regions while our chapters at the National Capital Region shall join the government workers rally from UST Espana at 10 AM and then march to Mendiola, Manila in the afternoon on this national day of protest of government workers.

       I didn't post anything yesterday since I thought it was best if I'd leave my birthday greetings to Gato alone for the moment so that there won't be any distractions. By the way I'm also glad that my niece Lorie visited this blog and has already signed my guestbook. Another is that I just submitted this and Pinay Blood Rush to the Philippine Blog Awards and I hope they'd find consideration to this site. On a more serious note I've reserved a greater portion of this post for current tragedy that has happened here in the Philippines, please read on...     One of these days we knew it was coming but we were just too stubborn to consider the possibility.  Yesterday, pan-Arabic television station, Al-Jazeera broadcasted the image of one of our greatest fears.  Angelo de la Cruz, a truck driver for a Saudi Arabian company was abducted in Fallujah after his convoy was attacked by a group of insurgents.  The broadcast shows de la Cruz in an orange shirt as presented by three masked and heavily armed militants. The militants demand of the withdrawal of Filipino troops in Iraq, and has give the Philippine government to withdraw its 50 man 'humanitarian' envoy on Iraq.  Up to this moment no one knows the fate that awaits de la Cruz, but one thing is certain. For its consistent lap-dog response to US Imperialism the newly re-established Macapagal-Arroyo administration will once again seek out help Westward to the direction their yankee masters.  It's not really difficult to comprehend that such an event was already sealed to its fate, eversince the Philippines joined the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing', (i.e. US Pupet Allies). Which has since then gone under fire from all fronts for supporting such an unjust war since it goes under the pretext of waging a war to respond to the USA's alleged discovery that Iraq harbors 'weapons of mass destruction'. Needless to say it was merely an act of agression since it goes under the reasoning of waging a war as means to prevent Iraq from utilizing its nuclear capabilities. So then again its merely a war agression. In other words the war is merely a ploy of the US to 'shock and awe' us of their capabilities to dispose of any regime that does not adhere to their notion of "democracy." Its not about a just cause its about American bullying rights. And no matter how we look at it a preemptive war is still war and the sickening thought about it is that preemptive wars are basically just the same as an act of  terrorism, which is no different from what happened in 911.  It is not surprising that there is such a growing opposition against foriegn pressnce in Iraq even after they have disposed of Saddam, since almost every country that maintains their ties with the United States have been constantly scouring Iraqi soils to look for business opportunities and such is true for the Philippines, in fact you'd be surprised of how long the lines are at the Overseas Employment Offices, for Filipino's trying out their luck on landing a job anywhere outside of our country, and what's even more surprising is that our own government really does give its all out support in their endeavor. I guess they'd rather have our human resources be exploited by others rather than keep them here to strenghthen our domestic economy. They'd rather have them give them dollars, than keep them in their talents for our own country's use.  But who can blame those who want to land jobs elsewhere on the world. With the onslought of neo-liberal globalization on 3rd world countries, anywhere but here in the Philippines would seem like greener pastures anyway. What do we have here anyway? Job security is a very far flung dream for many since the Herrera Law was sanctioned to favor contractualization among companies. The cost of local utilities continue to rise and the prices of fossil fuel continue to become a burden for everyone, making the cost of living here financially intollerable. So the best way to be done with all these problems is simply to just leave this country and hand ourselves to our foreign masters. As the popular saying goes "if you can't beat them join them."  Don't get me wrong I don't blame people for finding jobs outside the country, but what I'm driving at is the fact that if we really would like to make our country better we better give it all by working here despite the low compensation since this is still our country.  Now going back to the capture of Angelo de la Cruz, its sad to say that such would happen to our fellow Filipino, but to think about it is not enough and whatever might transpire in the coming days is regretable, but what would be more regretable is that if ever such a thing might happen again, take not that this has been the second time that a Filipino has been taken captive by Iraqi militants, and take note also that already a handful of Filipinos working there have died due to the violence errupting there.   To merely feel sympathize with the plight of Angelo de la Cruz would mean to simply seat on the sidelines and continue to live our lives apathetically in tolerance to the reality that the event of dela cruz's capture is the by product of our government's support for the USA's imperialist interests and that like other countries in alliance with the US our government is also just there to simply milk the resources of Iraq at the expense of its people. And it is really questionable as to why our country still sides with such imperialists despite the recent discovery of human rights attrocities and widespread torture conducted by its troops. If you sympathize with Angelo Dela Cruz's plight or if you are against the continued pressence of US and Filipino troops in Iraq let your voice be heard, to shut up is to agree with the injustices presented. Do something you need not be part of a political movement it is your initiative let the truth be known, let not the shadow of apathy continue to cover our thougts.   And lastly is to pray for the safety of Anelo dela Cruz and for the peaceful resolve of this conflict. Lastly pray for lasting peace and a change of ideas among countries since present conflicts are merely brought about by the prevailing economic interests of every country to improve its economic stability.   Let not your mind be covered with the dark shade of ignorance, if you do not favor the continued pressence of our troops there or if you do not favor the advancement our the US and Philippine economy at the expense of the Iraqi people speak up let your voice be heard.

       urlLink    Being the youngest of a family that boasts of seven siblings it was only now that I realized that I am one of those (sort of...) unfortunate kids who were never given the chance to have a kid brother (or sister), for that matter though it may seem obscure of me to think of such you just got to wonder how it feels like, seeing as to how my nephew Arno would stand up for his little brother Ciro whenever I come to the verge of beating him to a pulp whenever we'd be wrestling ala-WWF in my parent's bedroom, really just makes me wonder what it would have been to have a little brother.     Now you may be asking why didn't I have a little brother, well to start with, my mother gave birth to me at a ripe old age of 46 years old and in medical circles that qualifies me as an menopause baby, which at that time made my family kind of nervous that I might turn up with autism, mental retardation, and the likes, but thank God that I turn out normal in terms of my physiology. So basically I grew up with my family where at the time live in the Republic of Cogeo Antipilo, where later on we moved to where we are now to this all normal looking house down the street of Malingap, Teacher's Village Quezon City where I spent most of my existing life with my parents, my sister's family and my Kuya Gerry who is twelve years older that I am.      Well, as I was saying earlier my childhood was almost as typical as any other kid would have lived it, though it wasn't that graced with typical Filipino games like text (which I most hated up to now because I really abhor the idea of gambling for children since I was raised in a very Christian home), tanching, patintero and a whole lot of other twenty something Pinoy games that I see from our gates as well as every time I would watch Batibot. Instead of text I collected those cards (especially the Marvel Super-Heroes series) and insted of playing tanching I played with action figures (GI Joes to be exact) and in place of patintero I would play dumbass soccer and Kamias Jevellin with my nephew Gato.      Yes, it was Gato, Arno's older brother who was only 5 years younger than me who lives just right behind our house, he was sort of for me a little brother since my closest brother was Kuya Gerry who was already way on his twenties during that time. What I remember with Gato is that we never ran out of things busy ourselves with every summer afternoon where we would bum ourselves with silly games, and 'comedy times' together with my dachshund Odie on my Kuya Gerry's bed, as well as when we'd both gather up our angst towards those fat bastard twins at AngTV and how I would hurl Odie at those two fatsos as if Odie were giving them a flying-kick; as well as to how we'd course like sailors whenever we'd see Pudong, Ginoong Boman, and Miss Minchin harass the protagonists of those cheaply dubbed cartoons in Channel 2, and how we both cried when we saw the death of Nelo and Patrash, and on that Christmas episode of Garfield where Odie spent his Christmas on the dog pound. Yes indeed it has always been Gato who'd be there with me during those countless afternoons where we'd be singing our hearts out to the Eraserheads' Ultraelectromagneticpop album, where it would eventually lead us (along with our dog Odie whom I try to give a voice by making Gato believe that it was really the dog who's talking by the way I would blurt out the dumbest stuff I could think of in that Weng Weng sounding voice) to our short-lived DIY recording career as standup comics (sort of like Porkchop Duo) aptly called Comedy Hodie & The Blackout Combo, where we'd be singing our favorite rendition of Oki-Doki Dok's theme song, complete with scratches and badass keyboards and rough guitar playing. Other than that we'd also make stupid mix tapes of that come from a single record that we'd often listen to and we'd pretend that it was a concert or something like that. And not to mention the times when I fondly get a copy of Gato's new homemade comic book that catalog's the continuing saga of Black Dogja, who is our personal adaptation of the Ninja Turtles, by merely twisting it to suit the characters of our two dogs Jiggy & Odie; other than that we also had the chance to bond and talk about the stupidest things ever like that time we thought of putting "Le Ar" after the names of our dogs so that they'd be like Fuma Le Ar of Shaider. And how fun it is when we'd play WWF where I'll be Bret "The Hitman" Hart and I'll be blurting out the silly phrase: "I'm the best, I'm the best in the WWF" and he'll be playing Coco Be Ware. Or how we'd buy Mr. Fruit for the Ultraman cards that came with it and how we'd mix our Mr. Fruit candies with Sprite or how we'd stir our glasses of Coke with lollipops. Or how we'd purposely mismatch the vowels of specific words and names just because we thought it was funny like: the way we'd call our Uncle Gene, 'Uncle Jim' and then we'd replace the name Jimmy Santos with 'Jinnie Santos' or how we'd call a Genie a 'Jimmy', or how we'd mismatch the name of my niece Lea Grace with her dad Leo so that we'd call her 'Leo Grace'. Or how we'd never ran out of names to give to his dog Jiggy who as it turned out is also called Diego, Pupu, Huhu, Memeng, Eeng, Buakulaw and so on. As well as when we both cried when the vet have to put Jiggy to sleep because of his viral infection.     Or how he accidentally launched himself from the window towards their bed, wherein his head accidentally got struck with a Matchbox toy car, which really freaked out my Kuya Benjie who was watching over us at the time and how Gato fearlessly had his head injury stitched by some grouchy doctor. Or like how we spent a day bickering with our neighbor Miguiling just because he got hold of our toy airplane. Or how he stood up for me when Lea Grace's little brother Ejay called me a fag. Or how he stood up against our Tita Yoya because he knows that not everyone in our house agree with her decision to expand their place and build that monstrosity of a construction at our house's backyard.     I must admit I'm a little watery around the eye area right now since I really cherish those good old days when the world weren't that complicated and the only thing that matters at that time was just about making the most of the afternoon brownouts and the idea of Odie being able to get out of the gate every time my late Tita Yoya would arrive in our house at around 3 PM. And the fact that I'd never ran out of stories to tell about those afternoons really brings a lot of nostalgic memories during those innocent times. Well sure it would had also its share of downfalls when Gato and I would fight over Trading Cards, Toy Soldiers and GI Joes especially over that particular Hydro Viper figure, which really brought out the worst in us, and how sorry we both felt for each other when Gato accidentally flushed it on the toilet bowl. And we would fight over who owns which Matchbox and how we'd fight over that particular blue landroaver matchbox. Or how I hated him when I was blinded for two days when he chose to let go of the tennis racket that was attached to rubber band that we stretched from one end of the house to another.     And if I were asked with questions pertaining to who Gato is, all that I could say to them is that I see him as a guy that's driven with passion, from way back to being a 3 year old kid that's into dinosaurs so much that he's memorized each of them by heart, as well as to the diet of each dinosaur; Whether their are carnivorous or herbivores; up to his breakthroughs of finishing Megaman, Keen 4, Duke Nukem Mortal Combat 4 and X-Men: Children Of The Atom  (take not that he could do all the fatalities and make the hidden characters appear on the two latter games) way before me or Kuya Gerry were able to go advance to level 5 or something to that effect; or how he learned basketball which I utterly never learned and how he would mimic the dribbling technique of Kobe Bryant when we played it at church and on the basketball court in Claret. Up to the dude that he is now who's getting himself featured on TV for his unquestionable skill in skateboarding. Other than that is also the mere fact that I shared most of my first things with Gato, I got my first chance to go to Star City (for that Lost World of Dinosaurs Exhibit), Megamall (for the book fair); the first time to be a cartoon figure in one of the children's magazine that my sister was working on (I was featured as an explorer wearing a pair of glasses and Gato plays himself in the Gato at Gata comic strip); Robinson's Galleria and my first rock concert where we were able to watch the now obscure Claret band called The Weed and True Faith; as well as when he amazed me and my high school classmates with his impressive collection of NBA cards; not to mention the time when we both learned how to roller skate way before roller blades were the in thing. And how we both got to learn to love the sport of skateboarding and how he taught me to pop my first ollie on his Chicago skateboard, and how he first taught me to log into my brother's Internet account by typing this particular password that he deciphered by merely watching my brother type it. Another was the fact that he believed in me and had faith with what I do and can do, he was one of the very few loyal fans of Life Is Trying, and also of the silk screen venture that I did with Jeanie and my other friends; he was the one who took silly pictures of me and my friends on afternoons with his parents' camera, and how he never failed to listen and believe the most stupid stuff I said to him ranging from my stories about Dragonball Z to my silly stories about the kids at church and my elementary school classmates (especially of Ruel), to the stories I would tell him about a couple of guys named Juan, Pedro and Pepe which were also told to me by my classmates in elementary; to my adolescent rebellion in high school, to my adventures as a punk rocker in Tandem Recto, to my stories of slapstick skateboarding with my friends, and to my fling with student activism. He listened and never failed to hear out what I say. Another is that he always gave me a feeling that saw me as someone who dared to dream groundbreaking stuff and do it for kicks. And I find it at times flattering that whenever we'd encounter his skate-buddy Gino at Alberto's Studio, he'd tell me of how much he learned of me all because of the stories about me that Gato told him.  I also remember why it is no wonder that every time we'd play those role-playing games in high school he'd always be the front man and I'll always play the sidekick: he'd be Batman in his costume and I'd faithfully play Robin in my briefs; when we'd play The Wonder Years he'd be Kevin Arnold and I'd be Paul Pfiefer; when we'd play Parker Lewis, he'd be Parker and I'll be Parker's geeky four-eyed friend; and when we'd play Doogie Howser MD, he'd be Doogie and I'll be Vine Del Pino. And if you'd ask what this would mean to me is that because of the fact that I've always seen such potential in him when he was six years old he's already been publishing Black Dogja comics under his Vavi Comics line, while it took me the start of my second year in college to put out the first issue of my zine. When I just started learning Francis M's lyrics he was already well on his way rapping "Meron Akong Ano"; and while I was struggling to lean how to do a running ollie on my skateboard he's already struggling on how to do a running kick flip on his skateboard. And how astounded I am by the fact that God has always blessed him in whatever activity it is that he decided to pour his heart into. Lastly I would also like to say that I've been told by a lot of people I know that he kinda looks like that pro-skater Bob Burnquist and come to think of it he really does look like him,     And right now as I see him going off to college, I see that there really is a lot in life in stored for him and though I may not be as close as I am to him nowadays I truly know I my heart that I wouldn't be much of the person that I am now if God did not allow Gato to play a special role in my life as a nephew, friend and as someone who's the closest to a little brother that I got, and I know that I have a lot of misgivings to him and that I wasn't as available as I am to him when he was growing up, and how I also became a bad example for him by making him a witness to all those unspeakable wicked deeds that I've done in the past, and how at times I'd be irritated with the way goes about in my room, I still really thank God for him, And also of how proud I am of him that he grew up to loving punk rock and not those twenty something hip-hop and lousy metal acts and for being himself and I hope that as I look back now I really want to thank him for all the memories and for whatever worth they may have all I can say is that it was worth all the while.

      Well, as you may again I've tried to give this blog a new look mainly this is for the reason that the last background that I had made it difficult for me to read since the color scheme that I used doesn't match and to my standards I think its an eyesore. So I hope this new scheme would be cooler than that of the past few days.

      Anyways I have nothing new to post here, I'm so wrapped up with the workload that it suffocates me and my coffee break would be meaningless (since I've already ran out of coffee) not unless I rest my head for a moment and maybe type something else for a change. Anyways I am also glad that there are a lot of friends that are getting into the blog nowadays. Well, how time flies my breaks almost over I got to go. Lastly I've now switched my search function from Tanikalang Ginto to Google since the latter is far more superior than Tanikalang Ginto and since its search function no longer works eversince last week.

      It's really kind of sad that such a very meaningful weekend has to end, but what can I say all things are really meant to reach its end anyway. I know you might be asking why I am feeling sorry that the weekend has ended for starters it means that I would have to go back to work again and at the least endure another 5 days of grueling editing jobs. Another is that I would rate the past weekend as one of the most memorable and most meaningful weekends of my very existence.  The past Saturday was very much like any other Saturday where I would go with Jeanie to attend VCF's Youth On Fire Service where later on we'd be going about whatever it is that we'd find profitable to do later, that (is provided that I would be available bacause Saturday is also the day where I'd be practicing bass guitar for the praise & worship team at our church.) But nevertheless this Saturday was an exception since I am not scheduled to play bass on the Sunday service so that very much leaves a lot of free time for me.  The day started out quite great to be honest since I started it with a devotion time that I was actually able to concentrate on, without the distractions of minding the time because I might get late for work and without the distraction of randomly falling asleep in the middle of the passages. Where it was also kicked off with a sort of long telephone conversation with my Kuya Benjie whom I mostly get to see only on Saturday nights and in Sundays, anyways the conversation was really great we talked about a lot of things and it was really the idea that we're talking again in a carefree manner that really touched me since I never really had the time to just talk to him and share my life with him eversince he got married and eversince I went cold in my walk with God, I've always had that indifferent attitude towards the people I care most about but, lo! Here I am again talking to him about my life and about the books I'm reading, the movies I've seen my present struggles and everything in between, and it was only now that I realized that it was one of my faith goals earlier this year when I participated at a prayer and fasting campaign at church, and I am as equally gracious to God for that for heeding my prayer goal. So on with the day I was also able to spend my free time to bond with Jeanie via going to get our hair cut together, where I got this haircut that sort of looks like the haircut of Yellowcard's singer, and we also both topped it off with going off to meet my best friend Xander at PUP before we set off to VCF. From there we went on to the service where I really enjoyed the praise & worship because it was one of the very few instances that I get to sing worship songs as part of the congregation instead of being part of the worship leaders. Well anyways the same day is also the day wherein I promised to treat friends and Jeanie's disciples to Likha Diwa for my birthday. And so after the service we went there and I am glad that they all enjoyed the meal, since the place serves mostly vegeterian meals, and later on came the part where I would be speaking to share a message from the Bible, well, to be honest I was really nervous, since I'm better at expressing things through writing instead of speaking and even though I have already prepared my message a few days before I am still at a lost with what I am about to share.  But still I decided to share the Word since the night would be a complete waste if the Word of God was not spoken I mean after all that's actually God's word and that what He would've wanted me to speak about rather than my rantings about how life works and so I started with a word of prayer where I asked God to guard my lips and to open our hearts that His word would enter it and later on I just spoke. And to my amazement I was just speaking out words which up to now are a mystery to me that I could explain and expound on Scripture and that I could fluently convey my thoughts to the people I am with at the moment. Truly it was the Holy Spirit that spoke since I know for a fact that I am not that great as a speaker. The message was that I spoke was about the question: 'what am I living for?' and so it went on for I think about more than an hour but it was worth it I have never seen the Spirit worked with such in my life that he turned my weakness in speaking a strength to speak up and it was one of the things that I also asked my kuya Benjie to pray for earlier the boldness to speak up and as it turned out it was God who chose to speak His word through me. After that we all decided to go to UP Sunken Garden and on our way there I also had a very in-depth talk with Xander with regards to his question with regards to his faith and his relationship with God and I think it the talk really did clear a lot of things for him. And until that moment I am still at a state of amazement that I could answer his questions in light of Scripture, and later on I was also able to talk with Jeanie's students concerning Christian stuff, and I must say it was really quite an experience since I have never talked so much about God to a number of people.  So as the talk went on one of Jeanie's disciples asked me about my question with regards to what am I living for and in surprised I just gave her this answer which actually came from the apostle Paul where I just said I chose simply to live for God using this passage: "To live is Christ to die is gain." I wasn't quite sure if it was the best answer that anyone could give here but that was what I just spoke there, but as the night ended and as I got myself ready to go to bed the question still lingered to me since what I answered was really vauge and not as specific to pertain to the details of my life. 'What am I living for' anyway? When I was in college I was living to advance a lot of good causes, but now that I am 24 and have already been assimilated into the system that I used to oppose a lot, what really am I living for? Then as if out of nowhere it a phrase that I believed I saw a long time ago at a bookstore shelf, suddenly poped out of my head. The phrase reads like something like this: "Secular work is fulltime ministry." And come to think of it its really true God gives us ministries where he predestined us to be effective and my work right now is involved involved with website maintenance and development, which I suppose that's where I ought to make my life a witness to others. And in this case via using this blog, since it really is about me giving away stuff about my life, and therefore I chose to use it and I know that this is this one place where I could be as transparent that I could get to you people since as I've said earlier I am not good at speaking but in writing so I guess this secular 'thing' that I am doing is the means that I must use to be a witness to the world and therefore I chose to use it.

      I find it hard to believe that there are still ground breaking music  out there that has yet to be discovered. I think the good old rock and  roll formula has reached its terminous. Nevertheless there are still some  artists whose music are still worth checking out.   One of them is this band called Refused who's album The SHape of Punk  to Come clearly blows my mind.         Another is Snapcase mainly because of their sheer wierdness and utter  disregard for mixing styles that range from formulaic punk to bad hair  metal song structures.      There is also the Dillinger Escape Plan, whose music I cannot find any  words that would describe it.      Lastly there is the International (Music) Conspiracy whose situationist  punk style mixed with funk and their adherence to Socialism really  gives me utter bliss upon hearing their songs.       I do not know about you people but I think these artists are still  worth hearing despite the fact that they're not that groundbreaking. Though  I don't know really there is this thing called paradigm shifts maybe  this is also applicable in music. What do you think?

      It's not that I am over-reacting or anything, but the pics.xs site is still down and I am starting to worry that I might have to start all over again. Anyways this is my lunch break and I just so happened to have found this old composition that I wrote here in the office when I was still on night shift and I hope you'll find the heart to enjoy it. Thanks.  Peeping down the Venician blinds  I can see the cars go passing by  From way up here they radiate  The dark night sky     Its way past midnight  And its only my lunch break  I'm hearing silly pop tunes  From a top 40 radio station     I don't know exactly why  I cannot help but feel this way  That in each time I think  It makes me wish it was Sunday     Where I could here Your Word  Sit down with the guys  Turn to chapters and verses  Partaking at each word     But now is a Friday  Two days more to count  But it doesn't have to be  No reason for nostalgia     I know you're right here  With me by my side  With Your words kept hidden  In my once weary and broken old heart     I don't know exactly why  I cannot help but feel this way  That in each time I think  It makes me wish it was Sunday     Where I could here Your Word  Sit down with the guys  Turn to chapters and verses  Partaking at each word

      People say that its nice to type words in the computer when you're feeling down and all and that when you feel just like that you'd begin to wonder when you've finished whatever it is that you're writing because somehow by some stroke of luck you'd never know in your wildest dreams that you might come up with some great piece of writing and you'd think that it is a prose that's worthy of a pulitzer and that you might even discover that you're such a great writer and I wonder if such is true for me because right now I'm not even sure what on earth it is that I am writing about other than the fact that I just want to keep on typing and that I am presently supposed to be busy with what the world considers as work but to my surprise I am here sitting in a reclining gaslift chair in a brightly lit room hearing nothing but the seemingly harmonic sound keyboards tapping in in unison to some sort of melody that I could not distinguish I've been typing now for about 6 minutes and I think this is enough I have to get back to reality, get back to work I've already spent an hour here in the office and I only have 8 hours more left in my 9 hour work day, I have a quota to meet; a deadline to catch; a productivity standard to comply with I hope this amounts to something; I don't know should this be posted or not or should this be considered worth something at all? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

      I couldn't believe what was before my eyes when I opened my blog, all of the images that I uploaded at pics.xs.to during the past 2 weeks were all on 404 status which means that they're not online at the moment. So what I did was look it up on the host's site and as it turned out the host server at pics.xs.to in Hongkong is down and that all the images stored there are 'temporarily' unavailable and there is this tiny probability that they might be lost but hopefully they won't because if indeed they get lost I might just have to upload all of them images again and hopefully in a new and better free photohosting site, but according to the site I just have to give it a few days to be back again and I sure hope that by that time I'll be able see the images again in the blog as well as in Pinay Blood Rush and at luiboi's blog I just hate the way that this thing makes me feel so helpless and I know that this is way to shallow for me to whine about, but nonetheless I hope that the images that I have at pics.xs.to will be back soon.

      	I must admit that this past few days have then again been quite a powerful testimony of how awe inspiring God works in our lives.   	Just this past Friday I was able to attend a youth service where former MBA superstar Alex Compton delivered a testimony of his conversion, which really moved a lot of us out there in the congregation mainly because of the fact that for such people like me I have become so familiar with Christianity in general that our own personal experiences of salvation have somehow almost faded into the back of our minds already and that no longer do take the time to really think about the full extent of God's work in our lives.  	And looking back at it I could still remember the preplexing thoughts that I had then which were better expressed with Aga's teary eyes as I prayed for him during the closing of the service. He said that like me he also regretted the loss of time that we both spent as "armchair christians". As I listened to his words such thought a feeling of remorse also entered my mind and that indeed for me I've almost spent both my years in high school and in college merely as a silent type of christian who discuss God merely in an intellectual level rather than out of genuine concern for the souls of the lost that are around me.  	But the thing is that despite of that I also felt a sense of comfort since I am here now talking about such with a fellow believer that have also grown cold in the faith, but to look at it in the present context one will ask where am I right now?   	I'm here at church praying for God's comfort for this weary bretheren. So later on I spoke to him of how I also fell to the same fate as his and that how wonderfully amazing it is that God still by His grace sought to restore us.  	The rest was all in all history.  But then again, I later spent that night on a walk with Jeanie along Ortigas wherein we spent the time talking about how God has worked so awesomely in her life and that she still can't fathom the extent of her joy in her newfound relationship with Jesus Christ.  I think we were already in San Miguel Corporate Center when she told me that she feels that we should totally submit our relationship to God, and that would mean that we would choose to forgo with its intimate aspects and settle ourselves as very good friends at the moment.  When I first heard it I must admit that I do not fully share the same sentiments as hers, but as I paused and took the time to think about it I realized something that God revealed  during that certain point in time as she said that though she is really that much on fire for God she still feels as though she was not giving a hundred percent of her life to God's Lordship, and in fact the same is also true in my life since I as well.  To cut the story short I agreed with her proposal, and chose the path of friendship. Knowing that it is God who is in control in our lives.  We did this because we loved God, above ourselves and that we both know that its either all or nothing when it comes to submitting our lives to Him.  It is really hard to imagine that we chose God over the almost 6 years of having such close ties, and that it is more so that a number of our close friends cannot believe it either but true enough we did chose it, and that despite of that we could still look back and smile at the memories that we had back then. And that I just know that for whatever those memories were meant back then whether it be good or bad, for what its worth it was worth all the while. If it wasn't for those tapestry of memories we would never have found our place in God's will.  As I look back not once before that decision did I ever thought about such submission to God, since we were not as earnestly seeking His favor then. And is it not such a great comfort that such a thing happened to us because we were only practicing our free will into doing what is right in the eyes of God.  So I guess the terminus of whatever it was that we had back then that we no longer have now, is not such a reason for mourning, because those moments that we spent back then were the best times of our live, and if ever I am a romantic novelist I would defintely include those things that we shared in my novel.   And the mere proof that this decision of ours is of God's will is because of the fact the blossoming of our love did not die nor does it lie there in the ground rendered with the foul deterioration of emotional rigor mortis.    I thank God that He allowed us to stumble into one another's orbit, and for allowing us to grow together for almost six years straight. Given the chance I'd be more than everything else be thanking Jeanie and speaking this lines: "Because of you I am a better person."  Another is that I'd linke to give her thanks for the memories, and thanks for the understanding that she shared and for the happiest moments in my life that she have shared with me, and I hope that I have been used as a channel of blessing to Jeanie and her family.   I believe it was this pastor named Dennis who said that the perfect picture of human love is not the sight of your beloved one standing right in front of you but the idea of both of you standing side by side looking towards the horizon and seeing what the world has to offer for both of you.  I hope that there are new horizons for us to explore as we travel along life's twists and turns as very good friends.   This is not the end but a mere beginning.  	By the way other highlights of the weekends included me being able to play again with the praise & worship team of our church. And that I was also able to have more extra time with Laix and Micheal when all three of us visited the art gallery at Megamall looking at paintings. Another is that Laix also spent the night at our house and we were able to talk a lot about how God has been working in our lives and on the following day he was able to attend the church service at GBC where we both learneed that behemoth and leviathan are both according to biblical scholars are indeed dinosaurs. And that I was able to play United Live's version of Now That You're Near & All About You with the praise & worship team after the service ended. 	Lastly I also had a lot of fun spending the rest of the day at this place already bordering to the Southern Luzon area of Parañaque along with Jeanie, Laix and Jem at Chit's house for their town fiesta.  	To look back right now I cannot help but feel overly exstatic by the fact that God is making His face shine upon me and all of my newfound friends.   Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart . -  Psalm 37:4   But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.  -  Matthew 6:33

      Oh great, then again I've fallen to the lure of coming in to work late. I really ought to leave earlier but I can't seem to find the perfect time to ride the MRT for the reason that (based on my experiences) I've never been able to ride the train  upon my arrival at the station because of the hordes of people within proximity that are also dying to get to work in time, and at times I'd have to go to roundtrips so that I'd be able to catch a train only problem is that it delays my travel time for about another 20 minutes. Oh well, I suppose there's always tomorrow.   By the way I hope you've already taken notice of the new pages that I've added and please do find the time to visit them, thanks.

      I couldn't believe my eyes when I got to see who just signed my guestbook... ...It was Señor Rotten or John "Rotten" Espiritu formerly of the legendary 80s to mid-90s punk band Philippine Violators. Apparently he was able to find his way through the site and I think was quite pleased with its contents.  Well to most of you the name wouldn't ring a bell or anything but I must admit to me this means a lot because his band was one of the very few local rock heroes (along with Yano, The Youth, Eraserheads, The Jerks and The Wuds) that I had when I was still a teenager, way back then. Another is that I was also one of the chosen few to have been given the chance to partake of the record releases of his label RMD. And though the band might have faded into obscurity to many nowadays. I'd still fondly remember the songs: Dawn Celia, Sikat Na Si Pedro, Hoy Hoy Hoy etc.  that during that time made my day whenever I'd listen to LA 105. Or how I'd smile and think of their faded pictures that are published in Hot Hits Songhits whenever I'd see their Tone Def releases on the sale bins of record bars and whenever I'd be visit the cooperative store at PUP where their album 3rd Offense is still on sale.  And come to think about it...its really nice to know God has His own way of making us smile since I am really under a lot of pressure here at work right now he still manages to make me crack a smile. Thanks John.

      I was quite disappointed when I first placed the hit counter a few months back because during its initial week of existence in the blog it has only reached to a total of about 20 hits. But as to my astonishment in just a span of two months it has reached to more than a thousand and I hope that the people that have taken time to contribute their hits to this blog have in return gained something out of this. Thanks.  By the way I have yet to setup a couple or more new pages for this blog the only problem is that I can't seem to make the floppy diskdrive of this PC to read my disks. But hopefully that will be resolved soon.

Please visit any time soon. Thanks.

      Last Sunday afternoon I was caught unaware when I checked this blog's email. I couldn't believe my eyes that m35b was nominated for the Philippine Blog Awards, and I couldn't give God more than enough credit for looking at this blog with favor. Anyways, I wasn't able to publish a post yesterday because of a luncheon meeting here at the office so I hope this makes up for the delay. I've recently finished putting up these link exchange icons for m35b and pinay blood rush and I hope you'll find the time to post them in your blog/site as well just copy the corresponding html code below the following image. Thanks.   urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m35b.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/m35b_linkexchange1.jpg" alt="m35b - where collective thought & action germinates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m35b.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/m35b_linkexchange2.jpg" alt="m35b - where collective thought & action germinates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m35b.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/m35b_linkexchange3.jpg" alt="m35b - where collective thought & action germinates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;          urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m35b.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/m35b_linkexchange4.jpg" alt="m35b - where collective thought & action germinates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink            &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m35b.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/m35b_linkexchange5.jpg" alt="m35b - where collective thought & action germinates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://m35b.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/m35b_linkexchange6.jpg" alt="m35b - where collective thought & action germinates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;       ____________________________________________   urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pinaybloodrush.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/pinaybloodrush_linkexchange_1.jpg" alt="where coming of age is daily routine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pinaybloodrush.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img  src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/pinaybloodrush_linkexchange_2.jpg" alt="where coming of age is daily routine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pinaybloodrush.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/pinaybloodrush_linkexchange_3.jpg" alt="where coming of age is daily routine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pinaybloodrush.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/pinaybloodrush_linkexchange_4.jpg" alt="where coming of age is daily routine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pinaybloodrush.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/pinaybloodrush_linkexchange_5.jpg" alt="where coming of age is daily routine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink           &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://pinaybloodrush.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.xs.to/pics/04082/pinaybloodrush_linkexchange_6.jpg" alt="where coming of age is daily routine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Anyways I hope this would be of your interest. By the way hopefully I'll be able to post my best of July by the end of this week. And while the updates on the links portion before the end of August. Please do continue to find time in visiting this blog. Thanks. God bless.
