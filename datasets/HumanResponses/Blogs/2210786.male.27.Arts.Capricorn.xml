      Innocent queries are questions that are asked by people, unknowingly. They are like those things that you blurt out of your mouth when you are staring into empty space after lunch with a couple of colleagues you dont really like ( except maybe the pretty one with the big tits and nice bangs ) and the sudden voice of the same "        " calling which is supposed to get you back into the 1 hour lunch break ( .." so now what do we do? we have 35 mins to go..") thang but instead you reveal your most naive and obligatory. a gasp. a burp. or the innocent query. Today's innocent query comes from a poor Austrian girl living near the outskirts of our polluted beaches. Damn the government and their conservation plans for labrador park. The last time i heard anyone having a good time there was Smelly "F" who was lost in Halitosis abyss ever since puberty and finally met a girl at a random party in school so he brought her there on one particular night and experienced "tiny screams" projecting from her shrivelly...ok too much information.Hear this:  Why is the Mac in Macdonald pronounced as Mac whereas in Machine it is pronounced as Masheen?--- Jorgvall Klaustern, 26, clerk  There are various ways the term Mac can be expressed as in Macintosh, Mac Daddy, Daddy Mac, mackerel, macabre, macikkau etc, but after some in-depth research and careful analysis of the history and origin of language and words ( the academic term is elocryptimiology) we can derive the fact that the Mac came from the spoken language of  the natives in Southern coastal town of Macswabbie, Scotland. There are a couple of clans back then, who are into bagpipes and vermouth and skirts and all and they sort of have a way of putting people into places . its like a caste system where people are actually respected and equal and the only thing they can make fun of each other is by the colour of the kilts they wear or lousy bagpipe music and so forth. So each clan is represented by the Mac plus something something and we can safely assume that Macdonalds must be from there. How did it get to America? Now we have to go way back in time when there was no atlantic ocean but trust me our understanding of time is pretty finite or we can maybe accept the truth that our beloved hamburgers came from Macswabbie.  Alternatively, Jorgie, have you considered the letter H that comes after the Mac so when that happens it becomes a bit Gallic so to speak?

      Scenario: I just discovered this thing called the flow enhancer that works wonders on paint, and yeah so i was painting for the last three hours pondering yet again about mankinds greatest inability ( maybe just mine) to express itself to a coherent extent to which people will finally understand how difficult it is to actually think of something or something handy or worse yet to utter it in a single breath. I realised even in my own "rented" freedom ( of five hundred plus plus) I am suffocating the likes of bedridden patients in a dark corner of the wards and its like the prison cell Megs was supposedly in on his own and I am starting to believe that maybe it's all in the mind. Not a day goes without me thinking of a thousand things to do, even if am sitting in my office staring at the monitor or waiting for some hack software to load for the longest time, or anxious me getting all excited about writing softwares even though sometimes I find it hard to even string a good sentence together. ( sorry had to go inspire some lazy ass to do work) But how can i blame myself when these softwares come with attractive tags like " ..solve your creative problems..." or " mindmapping made easy.." or " ..to put all your good ideas into one.." and at this point in time people here are really really desperate about getting something out of the head and onto something.   Things I Will Invent This Century  1) The One & Only Halal Japanese Sushi Bar 2) A brush that is mentally connected to the brain via osmosis  3) A full sized pregnancy test cubicle equipped with anti-foetus flushing device 4) the ultimate scent that translates your personality into smell 5) we can do with another microsoft i guess 6) and apple 7)a hyrid pig-cow aptly called Controvers-C that blurs the line btw halal /non-halal creating an F & B scandal to haunt the years to come 8) some wedding invitations ( i got a brother and a sister) 9) a more accesible GUI for music making where it works like a painting and not some techy SB 4170 telephone operator 10) free education. i mean really free education. like you dont have to pay money that kinda thing. ah what do u know

      Something came to my mind when i was sitting on the train on my way back to the studio. It felt like something hazy, but i know i was going to recognize eventually,so i tried damn hard to keep it in my head until i get back and put it down in words. But i was distracted by this strange behaviour of a couple standing right in front of me, facing each other. They were facing each other but they were not looking, they seem distant but i heard them communicating which made me jumped into a conclusion that they are simply dodgy. Bangla worker VS Filipino Maid. What would be the chances of true love taking place? We'll never know but it is simply irritating to be distracted by this sort of content.  In another story i read today when i got up at 4pm, (the plan was to get up at 1 pm , get all my stuff and leave before my mother gets back but last night i watched 3 VCDs in a row and slept before 5 (( before she gets up)) so u know..shit) from an assorted piles of books and magazines next to the Mattress, a certain footballer claims to have invented his own shuffle, Sharpey's Shuffle, which he has been using as a celebratory gesture when he scores in matches. That got me wondering if it was actually possible to invent our very own personal shuffle because I am certain there s probably a dozen shuffles out there but the only one I know and actually seen is the melbourne shuffle at this party a month ago. Its a dazzling display of mindboggling precision and finesse, ok i am exagerrating but its the kind of footwork that makes kids below 10 think you are actually cool and i mean why not? Maybe I should starrt working on my own shuffle. Maybe i should organize a shuffling competition and then start a shuffle workshop and start marketing it to churches, CCs and other mushy community thingies. Shuffling is definitely a whole lot nicer to see, ok am not so sure if its the same when ur sober but hey come on) than say line dancing and shuffling is not necesarrily for everybody so that would mean it wont be so popular and leave the stools at home where they belong. say goodbye to lines!!  Possible Names For Shuffles I Create:  1) The Muffle Shuffle - if u ask me it just sounds right 2) The Mat Shuffle 3) Fluffle 4) Rizzie Shuffle 5) Jah-vel ( as in juffle get it ?get it?)

      Scenario: My fingers are coated with spray mount, a form of glue in a pressure-can which sticks to you like a bad hair day rep a few million weeks ago and doesnt work with water or saliva or anything at all, a colleague is motherless for 2 years now but that will not stop me from talking about her turtlenecks, daily combos and this sudden shrill that she somehow can project out of her Minah limbo into the an already abysmal office environment, my boss is on crutches after a wicked muscle pull in Penang last weekend and wears hawaiians still, and to be on cue, i missed some show at Fort Canning this evening.   After 7000 heart attacks, I am finaly done with this current project am working on and it feels so terribly good. Looking back I know i spent like 50 hours on that piece out of the 650 that was available to me and i spent an hour sitting on my desk wondering why. And to make matters worse I started toying with the idea that it was not of the kind of quality I so expect from myself. like Vidal and his wiggies when he was starting out, and that made the present reality harder to accept and obviously, in light of this, i was rewarded with an explicit fervour that cried to this weak and deprived body to dont mind the mind and "do your thang". for 5 minutes i was truly convinced. Then unexpectedly, and for this to be rationale i have to take a short breeze through history a few weeks not so long ago when, in true Dilbertian fashion, i offered my intelligence and knack for computers as a novelty to that prized moment when somebody, dont remember who but it was not shrilling, needed help in printing documents. I believe that might be the clincher of an act that made everyone in the office thinks I was the One. The so called tech support. The email application launch expert. The appletalk guru. the desktop utility diva. the default printer commander. the supreme network overseer. the network demon. ok enough. So my intangible focus sphere was being intruded by persistent calls for technical support and all that jazz and i think thats where the other 550 hours went to. its alarming.  what would be more alarming than this? maybe this one. after a brief, i looked at the bemused AE solemnly, obviously whatever she said went spinning in my head, and said" You know, our society values things different-ly and th...." when i reliased neither her nor me have any idea where thi sis coming from and at that moment i wish that Mcdonalds Happy Meal toy on my monitor would instantly fly over and kill her with its nose. or kill me. its easier. the minute after was awkward, like bambi in a disco gyrating on illuminated floors, and i sought refuge in tech support even when no one needed  it.  bleargh.

      Scenario: A newly burnt ( that sounds bad ) CD-R of a Glasgow band who call themselves Franz Ferdinand is out of its white envelope, they are named after the Duke of Austria who got tragically whacked during a ceremony 56 years ago this very day on the country's national day and sparked a war that left an impact on the world for several years and more years, a badly scribbled free notepad that came with the expensive purchases at our favourite art materials store whose cashier is a snappy bitch snapping at people for membership cards, a girl with a long runny nose sitting on the floor cutting a overbrownish printout of a shopping bag I made a few sleepless nights ago, a can of spray mount hiding under the coffee table, a song called trouble, a wind called mariam and a sneaky stillness in the air denounces the upcoming zen-parallelism moment a tired soul is almost always expecting. I am just thinking about why the hell did i put the conditioner before the shampoo and where did the bathtub plug go to. I havent been able to get my usual hot afternoon bathtub session for ages now and i kinda missed that.    I also miss the smell and taste of a certain flavoured cake i used to eat when i was a boy, it doesnt taste like anything fruity, or woody or savoury or french, or vanilla malt or caramel or soaked in rum or the smelly tapai or berries and nuts or artificial. I miss the joy of nintendo,  the surprise in snakes and ladder or LUDO, the greed and wealth of monopoly, or poker and wet bills and odours of filthy pockets and fingers, and the sight of wide open spaces, green fields and climbing angsanas, and eating wildflowers like they are supposedly edible and harmless, and buried treasures or found eggs in the bushes, or sliding down the green wet slippery slopes on corrugated cardboards, or plastic water guns with special homemade blend of onion, chilli and ginger which blinds the eys of your enemies, and older buddies who fuck up first in life before you, or older buddies who beat you up when you pissed them off and you run back home crying to an empty house where your neighbors keep staring at you but they are too poor to give love, and neighbourhood stray cats that make a home of drains that seem to collect nothing but disease, waste and larvae which must have disgusted everyone except mother nature so right during the day and so cold when it matters. i miss the waking up to nightmares, that physical buzzy feeling that gets to you when the tv is nowhere in sight but you know its turned on, i miss the black and white noise, the colour bands, and waiting in vain for my favourite TV shows because i couldnt read the tv listings nor am i aware that it exists in the first place, the remote controlled car that s attached to the remote control by a grey wire, the stolen toys, the lost toys and the new ones that only come in good guys.   i also miss an awful lot of chances, avoided some by choice and i miss assembly for one whole year when i was in secondary 4.  i miss sinalco, cherry ripes, that pyramid shaped kueh and dark chocolates.  to be continued

      1) Putting white text on black background 2) Putting photos of you and friends in bracket sequences 3) Background music. Its like stuffing your bras with tissues. 4) Putting pictures of your pets and calling it baby or " I love you baby". We get it. 5) Putting photos of your partners and doing the exact same thing. We dont get it. 6) Drunk writing. 7) Using complicated layouts that load text first and images in the next ten years 8) Putting white text on black background. Oh I said that already? 9) Put dictionary terms for meaning of words when you have nothing to say. Theres too many terms la 10) Put a list of top ten things of whatever. Who do you think you are?

      Scenario: Prematurely ended bath after a sudden realisation jolted the self into a minor adrenalin driven belief to conquer a certain goal in mind, a bottle of peach tea at the bottom of the table, used cotton buds strewn all over the table where the mousepad used to be, a fallen promo calendar made of cheap paper fails to live up to its design, a blank written CD-R remains anonymous, and more of it as the trail leads up to a tied up plastic bag containing Hand Brand peanuts, I am cold and my hair is colder i think but last i looked at the rack i must have used up over 4 towels in a period of 3 days. ANd thats probably just for drying hair and they are dropping bit by bit. I must stop wearing white. I feel lousy looking at the mirror. I have a project I probably cannot finish on time and my boss is the devil who refuses to live in the 90s or the millenium or whatever. this place still stinks of whatever i had for dinner a month ago and my cups are breeding fungus and something colourful. Brrr..I am cold. This is the life.  Everyone I assume try to live quite single mindedly about everything they live for and priorities are just different so to one fella this other fella whom we shall call Babs, is just a lazy ass waiting for god knows what and probably he feels when he rests his smelly feet upon the IKEA coffee table that he amazingly fixed himself not so long ago, when they couldnt cos he would nt pay them, but then thats him i suppose, capturing that single snapshot of a moment and willing it into the twilight of his life that he s time to act is the thing of the future or his future and for the other fella, whom we shall call Megs, is living it now rather sorrowfully blaming himself for worrying about the least important things in life everyday. I feel a certain affinity for this Megs character because he is sort of unwaringly enslaved to an innocent. foolish and dangerous creature of habit. This maybe to a certain extend is comparable to Narcissus staring but at an empty pond thats been dried up for days by the sun leaving a messy pile of sea creatures, weeds and botched love letter in a bottle attempts by seafaring homesick young men, and Narcie this time thinks the beauty of all this monstrosity found at the bottom of the pond, that maybe no one will attempt to discover unless, like him, they think nothing of seeing themselves as remnants of a destructive cycle of nature. Maybe Megs only finds truth or am aware of his daisy chain existence when he's on the brink of some bitter consequence, can be accumulative or just when he 's riding on a cause that has totally nothing to do with anything that will ironically make him more aware.  Meg's reflections become counter productive as it weighs him down with the guilt and expectation or the sheer realisation that he s ( cliche no:2136) " a prisoner in his own cage" like Betty Lee who think s the world of Enid Blyton but cannot write beyond that level of imagination because to her everything else is incomparable to the one and only perfect prose she had known by heart and had written her stories to be each as close to the magic of the Faraway Tree  and its equally delightful neighbours. But the good people of cambridge think otherwise and she flunked her GP, running away from the cheers and jubilation of the students at the hall, in tears and never to be seen again. I guess for both Megs and Babs their cages are apparent to themselves and even the damage done to them.   Can you imagine living life everyday wishing, expecting, urging for one moment you are going to make happen to end all of the things that you are enslaved to? Megs probably hear voices calling him day in day out to tell him about what to do, where to eat, what to wear and what will happen if nothing is happening in the next few minutes and what he is not going to do about it  and for some people like Melvin Ong, it just tears him apart at the very depth of the mind even though on the surface nothing seem to change. The creatures of habit and tendencies that they are, they probably forget everything about what they come to realsie the day before and I guess for Megs, that is the kind of life intended when you live right here right now. cliche no:343

      Scene: Studio after 10, aircon blasting, no music, in boxers and sweater, papers lying all over the floor, half-read yesterday's news on the litterbin, copy of the latest TOKION, a plastic ruler, a dirty white quilt, a sleeping bag, hangers partially hidden under the sofa, a page of the EURO 2004 tournament fixture, halfway filled (apparent disinterest in who s winning), empty merlion logo prints plastic bags overlapping each other . The neighbours are sleeping but the chinese boys opposite are having fun washing their laundry and maybe a bit of those loud irreverant noises that yours are sort of prone to.   Like on the edge of something. Like right now I am on the edge of the end of  a short boring week and the weekends arent that great. weak but things got sorted out with the packaging project, my brother turned 30 ( god bless him) ( and he s goin gout with a fat girl) (fat) , finally finally got my ass to exercise but truly truly disappointed when the blades broke apart tragically 5 minutes into it and I had to bail out and get fat at a dinner. jeez. i wish all of this meant something in that ominous cooky white marble toga blindfolded oracle sorta way. but it doesnt no. the simplest truth you and i can derive from this cosmic karmic roundabout schemy brainwashed to the fullest power of 10 is that I am just overweight ( not fat) ( no way) and I just need some more ( am not) hours of exercise before i return to my richard gere meets johny depp at Fight school best. its a long way i know.   positive things. i might start a top secret secret business with someone and i am not going boast about it or anything because its nothing new or mind blowing but i have a feeling that it will work. now that feeling is the most important factor you have to take into account when making a decision. same if it fucks in your face but hey the road is too long to be saying " NO its not going to work. we are all going to die!" i just have to tweak my focus ring sphere to make it even bigger so it can encompass more things and just let the energy flow and sapped into the veins of anything that it comes across wit h my spirit and electricity. woohoo. seriously i think for me its time to own up to being responsible for my own life, and maybe for me it mean s that I have to try and do something else or whatever that i can to make whatever i want and have been dreaming of happen. it s like the 5 years before the phase " Living the dream" begins and all it takes is some toil and a lot of commonsense plus an even wider focus sphere. The thought of doing setting up my own business just appeals to me even though its not in that moneygrubbing sort of way but more to social experiment with a hazy outcome. that truly excites me. like i said top secret secret. so hush for now.   •Right now, I wish I knew… the 6 winning numbers for tomorrows TOTO lottery draw  •Right now, I feel I’m missing…some old feelings from a latter phase of my life which I will never get to experience again  • Right now, what’s keeping me going…are the dreams that i often conjure in between the sketchbook and sleep  •Some of the things I know for sure are…that there is someone better than me out there  • For the past six months…I ve been living a dodgy life in the middle of a red light district  and doing laundry at my mom's ( SELLOUT)  • Within the next six months…I will move to another place with an attached bathroom and more space to paint the living daylights out  • 5 years ago…I was young and foolish  • 5 years from now…I will be old and foolish  • I had the best time when…I am working too hard on something  • I don’t understand why…all women dont have equally big tits  • Nothing is gonna stop me from…finding out why  • The only thing that’s holding me back…theres too many women  • In a perfect world, I’d be…not talking abt tits 24/7  • If I were to be a bastard, I’d…be talking abt tits 24/7. wait a minute...  •  If there wasn’t this thing called consequence, I’d…have 50 tits on the same day  •  I can’t seem to stop…thinking abt tits can I?  •  My favourite word of the moment is…TITS!

      Our dear south african friend Steve left abruptly this morning stating that he wasnt happy working here and all that jazz and he's going back to south africa to start a mini restaurant at the edge of town selling liver pate made from freshly killed gazelles or depending on how but kind donations from the dreary hunting parks of the town where he came from is always welcome he said and I barely knew him well enough to say anything about the matter lest judge him on his attitude to leave without saying goodbye.of course bearing in mind i am not exactly an honest or nice or both person someone can easily adjust to, to start of a flying career with (there s always beavis the cat) and i kinda leave that option alone cos i need to feel courageous to get through this sketchy day, so i suspect that the reason Stevie The Boy Wonder left is because of differences in our working and active culture and in some ways it made him a bit smaller than the person that he is. And maybe a litlle less creative and blablabla and we know how creative ppple alway get personal about things and things that are not theirs and so my conclusion is that at that age of 67, Stevie Nicks probably have done it all and a good grasp of both design and thinking faculties which means that he don't have to deal with whatever he had to this week to make a living. we can probably blame him for being inflexible with the way we are( and we did last night over prata ) but i think we are as inflexible as he is ( because of this opinion i had to pay for dinner last night) and it is so suprising when you think about rationally. This i have always argued over in my mind when I felt that the company somehow stopped to exist as the overbearing entity that I am loyal to. I feel that the company should sometimes turn on that mommy personality to accomodate to different personalities that work under it and if it wants me to bleed for it i want it to bleed an ocean for me to make me believe that it s worth the pain and the hours and the rejections and whatever thats similar to working in another industry for the same amount of money and rigor.so maybe Steve Jobs feels the same way about work and I assume that in South Africa, the folks work and end at 5 and get drunk by 10 and still get enough sleep or sex to work again the day after and the world still moves on. And i think thast what s happening at europe or america and they re still so much better at work than us. which makes me wonder why we re doing it the way we are over here and think that it's alright to do it when rest of the world has shown that its not. I will end this with a stupid artist quote: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- " I'm interested in portraying puppets, and sometimes I turn it around to have puppets controlling humans. I just like puppets, carnivals and fantasy themes. Artists I'm inspired by include Briton Stanley Donwood (who has collaborated with Oxford-based band Radiohead on its artwork) and Paula Regu (a Portuguese-born painter)." -----------------------------------------------------------------------  I think there s more.

      When i was a boy, the most distinct and cruel memory I had of myself besides innocently slipping into a dark bedroom where a couple was having sex, bad sex now when i think about it, was me running after a kitty cat with a dusty coconut stick broom and somehow cornered it into an unoccupied garbage collection area. So there i was, broom in hand, planning my next step, and i swear to god it was all instinctive, if you assumed I was already thinking by then. ( i started in the 90's and experienced a sudden decline near millenia and things haven't been the same since then) and it didn't help at all that i had 5 older boys behind me urging me to do something nasty. Now i dont want to go into the pitfalls of peer pressure or lame peers or having no peers like Faizul Ramli from the next block, who I was told grew a beard and wears baggy pants to work everyday and still listens to heavy metal in the likes of King Diamond ( we love him!!) etc etc and who regrettably was accused of looking suspiciously terrorist even though he started it way before them Afghan Whigs..or Daniel Day Lewis no to mention Brad Pitt in that movie with Han Solo. Still my point is, at that tim ethere was only one path to take and when you think about it in the absence of conscience, it was a fair route to take to propel a growing up boy with all the accollades that he couldnt envisioned himself receiving later in his adult life ( and still not ) and so he did what he had to do. The kitty cat went blind that day after the BROOM swept a pile of cement powder into its eyes. The little boy went home and cried for years.

      right on. There should be a better term to celebbrate my return to blogging but "celebrating a blogging event" is not on the cards yet for the people at Oxford Press, them , with their long sleeves folded, sweaty arms akimbo, pondering the next big word to add on to the ever thickening, which might remind some of you about dental hygiene, capillary tubes or lingering debts from high school years, sorry, if not fully blowned killer of a book I have often sought counsel for the wrong reasons. But what attracts me most to do this on this particular night is not  because of my fascination for fat books, or the fact that my house tripped up, sit down pearlyn, for like 67,890 87 times tonight. Which in the event afterwards, I started feeling some kind of warmth knowing that Krusty and her brain ( they work together sometimes) got the small, and now trusty, torchlight at Mustafa. For a good price at that.  I must have gone through several failed relationships with blogs, some richfully despaired or otherwise forgotten, probably lost  in that internet thing, or at least in my dour mind, and to think of a worst case scenario, ending up as some extremely pleasurable evening read-up for some poor soul who came unscathed from all those interstitials.  > Again I am feeling a bitt oo apologetic for being an irresponsible writer, who is unwittingly not talented but wilful and full of surprises and your fair share of skirmishes whereever skirts and halternecks are in dispose, but also i try to remind time and again that it is not entirely wrong or old to forget. But as much as a forgiver of mistakes the internet and all its bloody apps are forgetting passwords is not so as a good man i should just learn to live and let live and move on to another relationship and maybe do justice to this one.   will try without saying i love you
