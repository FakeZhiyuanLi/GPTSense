      Well, today sucked.  I had to march in the christmas parade.  I hate marching.  Though, it is the last parade that I will ever have to march in again.  So that is good.  That is all.  See ya.

      Thanksgiving was fun.  We did not do the traditional thing and have turkey, we had pork roast instead.  Pork roast is better than turkey anyway.  Though, today we did have turkey.  It was a trash can turkey.  This is a really cool way to cook a turkey.  When the turkey is done, it is jucier than turkies that are cooked in the oven.  It also is done a lot quicker.  No matter what size the turkey is, it will be done in 90 minutes.  My dad found this in a camping cook book.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya!

      Well today I went on a hike in Shades State Park.  It was fun.  It was a really nice day to go on a hike.  It was not to hot for when you are hiking, but when not hiking you are not to cold.  It also is not to long of a drive.  Yesterday was horrible though.  I had to spend my whole day doing things with the church, and have a million pictures taken of me.  I hate pictures!  Well, this week of school will be cool, because I have only 2 days of school.  I get the rest off for Thanksgiving.  I also get to go on my first varsity meet on Tuesday.  It will be fun!  Well, see ya.

      Well, today was an awesome day.  AT first my coach wasn't going to let me wrestle for a varsity spot, but then toay he told me that he was going to let me.  So, I wrestled this other 160 pounder and i pinned.  So, now I get to be the 160 pound varsity wrestler.  That was the highlight of my day.  It may not seem that exciting, but it is to me!  Well that is all for today.  See ya.

      Life is going good.  I am still doing wrestling, but my idiotic coach is not letting me wrestl for varsity until after Thanksgiving.  Oh well, I will just have to wait, because I need to wrestl varsity this year.  School is going well.  I have good grades.  Not much is happening in my life, so I don't have much to write.  So, see ya'll.

      Well, my day was horrible.  I had get up and go to school, which sucked.  Then I had to got to wrestling practice which sucked.  Mostly, because a kid decided to jump onto my back while I was getting up.  Now it really hurts.  I also got into trouble for sleeping most of the way through my algebra 2 class.  Oh well, algebra 2 is way to easy.  That is why I sleep through it.  Well, that is all that I have to say.  See ya.

      Hey.  This is a great day.  School was closed, and so my coach didn't hold practice.  I did have to shovel the drive way though, oh well.  I know that I will have to make this day up, but I really did not feel like going to wrestling practice.  Next weekend I will be at Hamilton Heights for sectionals, if anyone wants to come they can.  I am hoping to get at least fourth place, so that i can go on to regionals.  This weekend I took the SATs.  They were boring, but I think that I did ok on them.  I hope I did well enough to not have to take them again, so that I can get into Purdue.  That is all that I have.

      Hello everyone!  My day was pretty darn good.  School was boring, but then I went to a wrestling meet.  It was pretty cool.  It was one of our best ones yet, we only lost by 10 points, which for us is a huge accomplishment.  I only lost by one point.  I almost beat him, but we went out of bounds with five seconds left.  Oh well, it happens.  That is all for today.  See ya.

      Went to the Mid-Winter dinner last night.  It was pretty cool.  Got to see people that I had not seen for a while.  That is always good.  Had decent food there, the food is the reason that went.  Got up at 11:30 this morning to go to the staff lunch thingy.  It was fun.  I got to see Laura, which always makes me have a good day.  Had goood food there.  Saw a lot of people from last night, and some people that I had not seen for a while.  After that I have just been sitting around at home and reading blogs.  That is all for today.  See ya.

      Hey, i'm back from Minnesota.  It is really cold up there.  I had an ok trip.  I learned a lot of things.  Like i learned how to cross-country ski.  That is really hard to do, but I have gotten pretty good at it I think.  I also learned how to snow show.  I hate using those things, they are so hard to use.  Well, i am glad to be home though.  That's all.  See ya.

      Today was awesome, because it was a half day.  I love half days, they are so awesome.  I also had a worthless day in school.  None of my classes did anything productive.  Works for me.  I don't need to learn.  I can't wait for camp to start.  I also want to see Passion of the Christ, but i never am able to get out to the mavie theaters.  Oh well, I will end up seeing it at some point in the future.  Man, i am actually posting like everyday, this is crazy.  Never thought it would happen.  That is all for now.  Will probably post again after teaching wrestling.  See ya.

      Well, I just got back from teaching the kids to wrestle.  I wish that it would go on for more than just one week.  It is fun to do.  It is so cool to be able to see how much they have really improved from the first day.  It's crazy.  Oh well, at least freestyle will start next week.  That will be fun.  My day was normal, except that it seemed to last forever.  I almost fell asleep in all of my classes today, oh well.  That's all for now.  See ya.

      Hey everyone.  I am thinking about actually posting almost everyday, we will see what happens with that.  I am teaching little kids how to wrestle this week.  My school does this program for kids that are in K-5.  It teaches them the basics of wrestling, so that if they want to join the wrestling team they will already know some things.  It is fun.  I am also teaching the camping merit badge in scouts.  This is an easy merit badge to teach.  Well I have to go and teach some wrestling.  See ya!

      Hey everyone.  I know i haven't does this in a while, and eveyone is starting to complain about it.  So, i have decided to update my blog.  Friday night I was going to go to the state finals, but my mom decided that the weather was going to turn to bad, so I didn't.  So now Laura is saying that I ditched her.  It was my mom's fault, i wanted to go.  So, instead of going to state the next day I went down to Fairland to see Laura, only I got lost and got there really late.  She got mad and went shopping with her mom.  So, when I got there she was not home, and then I went home.  My mom made go back down and apologize to her, so we went out to Greenwood.  It was ok, Greenwood isn't much fun.  I also learned that Fairland truly is little.  I was happy to see Laura.  Got home around midnight, the traffic was horrible.  That is all.  See ya.

      Today i went to regionals.  We did alright, we had one person go on out of two.  Oh well.  Last night i went to a regionals sucks anyway party.  This was just all of the varsity wrestlers who did not make it to regionals.  We stayed up late drank mountain dew and played 8 person halo.  It was fun.  Then, when we were at regionals, four of us went out to find food, and i was driving and broke almost all of the rules of the road.  Good times.  Then after regionals we all went back to the house where the party was and ate chips and played some more halo, then we went home.  That was my day.

      Yesterday I had to go to sectionals, I almost made it.  I lost the match that I needed to win by 3 points.  Oh well.  Now my season is over, until I start doing freestyle wrestling.  That should be pretty soon.  Today I went to the Firecrafter council commitee meeting.  It was ok, I guess.  That is all.

      Hey, i have had a great weekend.  Yesterday I went down to Fairland to talk to her troop about the basics of caving.  It was pretty cool.  They actually listened to me, or at least prtended to.  Then I hung out with Laura.  A whole bunch of people wanted to meet me.  I had to go talk to her best freind and her grandparents.  It was cool, I kind of wanted to meet them anyway.  Then we went back to her house and just chilled there.  I had to leave her at 5 though, because I had to go see my uncel.  He is the coolest uncle in the world.  To start he manages 4 comic boook stores, and will end up owning the chain.  His comic book stores just got arcade games, and he invited us down to one to play them for free.  So, after he closed down the store he made it so that we could play them for free.  It was awesome.  Then I went to an Eagle Court of Honor today.  It was ok.  Then I just have sat around the rest of the day.  Well, that is all.  See ya.

      Hey everyone.  I went to the Del-Mi district award banquet.  I got recognized for getting my Eagle.  I also saw Jeremy Brown there.  That was cool, he was getting recognized for his Eagle also.  I also saw Mr. and Mrs. Byer there, I talke to them a little bit.  Then my dad got two awards.  He got the soutmaster's key, which was a lot of work for him to get.  He also got the district award of merit, which he did not know that he was getting it.  The wife of the recipient gets a call, and so one of our freinds that was going took my mom after my dad and I had left.  It was cool, and i think that he really deserves it.  It was a pretty good night.  Not really interesting, but goood.  Well, i will talk to you all later.  See ya!

      Hey everyone, as Jimmy pointed out I again stopped updating my blog, so here is my updated blog.  School is fine.  It is really boring, and I always fell like sleeping in school.  I try not ot, but it still happens.  I am happy, because freestyle has begun.  It is a lot more painful of a sport to do, but it is also a lot more fun.  There are alot of really cool moves that you can do.  You also do not have to worry about hurting the person, because in freestyle the rules are not as strict.  You can basically just throw people into the air, and not get in trouble.  It is awesome.  Well, that is all that I have for now.  See ya!

      Hey, I know that I have been really lazy and haven't updated in more than a month, but here I go.  This weekend I went to prom with Laura.  I had fun there.  I learned that I can't dance worth crap.  Oh well, I never expected to be good at it.  Then after prom when we were trying to find a starbucks I ended up racing the car that we were with.  It was fun, mostly because he got pullled over and I didn't.  Then we just decided to go to whitecastle.  After that, Laura and I went back to her house and changed.  Then Laura and I spent all of saturday together, it was fun.  As of right now I only have one free weekend until the end of school, thanks to scouting.  I will probably end up doing something that weekend also.  I can't wait till school ends.  The end is so close, and then I will only I have one dumb year left in school.  I want camp to come also, I miss the waterfront.  We are going to have no one experienced there this year though.  I really want to go to the Blink182 concert on June 1st, but I do not think that my mom will let me.  Who is goint to the spring fellowship?  Steve and I will be there late.  Well, that is all I have for now.  See ya.

      Hey everyone.  I went caving wiht Laura's troop yesterday.  It was fun, but they complain a lot.  So, I don't think any of them are going to become future cavers.  Then I spent the rest of the day just around her house.  I got home at midnight.  It was an awesome night out though, it was warm and pretty bright.  Then, I spent today doing nothing.  I have got finals all next week, but it is only three days, and two of them are basically half days, which is aweesome.  So, I have three days of hell left, then I am out of there and a senior.  Camp starts in two weeks, and that is awesome.  I can't wait.  Well, this will be my last post until next year.  See you all at camp in two weeks.  I'm out of here.

      I had an awesome weekend.  The first part wasn't so good, when I was at my band concert.  We did horrible, or that is what I think.  Oh well.  Then, as most of you know, I went to the staff weekend.  IT was cool.  I did a little work, saw a lot of people that I haven't seen in a while, and had fun.  It is always good to be able to go back to Ransburg.  I can't wait till summer starts.  I want to go back to camp so much.  I have one and a half weeks left of school.  It will be awesome when school is finally over.  Then I will be a senior and have only one year left.  Stephen's Eagle Court of Honor is tomorrow, and Will and I are doing basically the whole ceremony.  It should be pretty sweet.  So now all of the Crayner's have reached the rank of Eagle, that is pretty cool.  Now all that Stephen has to do is get all of the merit badges, and he is really close.  He has 90 and only needs 30 more.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya!

      Hey.  I had a great weekend.  I went down to see Laura.  It was fun.  Then Sunday I just sat around all day.  That was pretty cool.  Yesterday I went to the Fermi Lab in Chicago for a physics field trip.  It was pretty cool.  For lunch we went to this restaurant where they take pride in being mean.  It was crazy, though they did have good food there.  On the Fermi Lab grounds there were buffalo, we did not really know why they were there, but they were cool.  I got home from that at 9:30.  Then I spent the rest of the night bullshitting a project, that I did better on that I thought I would.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya

      Hey.  The spring fellowship went well.  I got to see some people that I haven't seen in a while.  That is always good.  I got to do things with fircrafter which is also always good.  It is awesome, Friday and Monday I get to go on field trips.  That is sweet, two days where I get to do nothing all day, the only thing is make-up work, but it looks like there won't be that much.  Life is good.  Well, not much is going on in my life right now, so not a very big post, but no one likes reading a long post anyways.  Got to go.  See ya.
