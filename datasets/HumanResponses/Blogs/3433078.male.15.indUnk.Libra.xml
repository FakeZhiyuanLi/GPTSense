      Wooooo its saturday, i just finished my 50 notecards!! :-D How schweet is that!? For debate of course, were debating renewable energy sources! Did you know that if 1% of the worlds deserts were coverd with solar panels they would create more energy than all of the burning of the fossil fuels that occurs world wide in one year?? Or that every year the US spends 500 billion on energy, 20 billion alone on buying oil from overseas!? Or that in 1996 over 57 million tons of materials were recycled? And These 57 million tons saved enough energy to power over 4 million houses with energy for a year!!!  Hahah ok enough of my eco-sensitive ranting! Im gonna go get ready to nadamos con nick y stu a el gran festival cierre del piscina whitehurst. Voy a completar mi debata a un otra dia    Adios

      Ok well ill start out on friday.   Friday:        Me and nick went swimming with erika and brooke, it was pretty awesome! After the adventure of them trying to get changed in the bathroom with all of the   bugs    But the swimming was   awesome  , and i hope they come again sometime!!! On the way to the beach we saw an ALMOST-fight....that was cool...Yeah but we swam over to the spit, and just sat and talked for a while. Then nick threw an old rusty beer can at me, and i blocked it, but it caught on my finger and took 2 nice chunks out of my finger pad...Looked bad, but didnt really hurt all that much. Then brookes step-dad came and took them away, so me and nick came back to my house and whipped out some GTA: Vice CITY!  Saturday:         Got up at about 8;30 sharp... Hah about 8;30 sharp...it doesnt make sense! but anyways, i mowed the back yard, and worked on the pool some. Then i went for a run, sprinted down to 7-11 from my house, stoped bought a slurpy and WALKED home!! Yeah, that was my kinda run. Anyways i dont remember what happened alot of the day, but then at my sisters play   i saw alot of people i knew! First i helped jen and hannah with some ladder, and suzie was there, and so was ally! So i talked to them all alot.. But then about 1/2 through the show i went backstage and found ally, so then we talked for liek an hour and a half. And THEN i went to get some gelato (after the show was over) and came back like 30 mins later to find ally STILL There! lol her parents were at a crokket party   and hadnt come yet, so i talked to her for a while more, and then went home.  Sunday:        HOMEWORK all day...Oh and i mowed the lawn and worked on the pool....And talked to people on the computer, but nothing eventfull... Oh well tomorrow is the MSA's for geometry, and after that i get to sleep in for the rest of the week!   Rating- Overall a pretty awesome weekend id give it a B+  Highlight- DEFINATELY swimming with brooke and erika!!!!
