      Please allow me to take this opportunity to apologize for such a long period of silence!  I have a few archived blogs from the original "carthsis" from my catharticramble.blogspot that will hopefully show up on this new page.    More to follow. Don't you fret!

      Well it is Friday and I took the day off from work.  It feels GREAT to just have the day to myself. I am slightly lonely, though.  Of course, I am getting a lot done. I have done three loads of laundry and separated the rest into piles. I have cleaned the living room, put away dishes, eaten lunch, and contimplated burning the paper garbage.  I was watching  Gone in 60 Seconds  but then I decided to be productive.  The family is coming tonight and staying across the lake.  My house is far from that but I should have figured I wouldn't have found a closer camp ground for them.  Oh well.  They'll be able to come and see my house, too! I am excited. I want to clean up some more so I am not staying online long.  Basically, I felt the need to check and make sure nothing earth shattering came through in my e-mail since I am not at work checking it every five minutes.  I do, however, want to print out the stuff about NYC but I cannot do that here because I have to open it in Netscape.  No biggie.  Okay, well, I am distracted by the chores I want to finish up.  I am going ot vacuum and then clean the bathroom.  Laundry is fun! Oh, the joys of no work.  I will begrudgingly go back on Monday and have an oh so exciting day.

      Two things...  I was going to write about how it's after 9pm and I am still at work for at least another hour and a half and I was in at 8:30 and didn't take a lunch and worked through dinner...  Then, though, I read the CNN headline on the Microsoft IE main page before opening blogger.  It said that there are two "terror suspects at large in Buffalo probe."  That is just fucking weird.  Sorry, can't help but use that word.  Okay, so that is just literally too close to home.  Talk about September 11th making people look at things differently.  Yes, of course I had.  Yes, of course it was a horrible thing.  However, now, mind you, most of my family lives near Lackawana.  Near enough that I find it totally bizarre that there are these "terrible, awful" people "at large" right near where my parents, grandmother, cousins, aunts, uncles, and brother live.  Yes, it is weird.  It is also closer to home (where I live, that is) than NYC or DC or that field in PA or any of the other places that have been on the news for a year.  I mean, yes, it would still be weird if there were "terrorists" discovered hiding out/living/working out of Buffalo.  Although, I tend to wonder if it would have made the news.  I tend to wonder if I would find it as heart stopping weird.  I tend to wonder if it made me stay awake for a few extra minutes each night.  Wondering.

      My other blog http://catharticramble.blogspot.com still allows you to read the archives and my posts up to July 12th but nothing after that works.  So, I have cut and paste from that last page and will use this from now on.  I have not yet cut and pasted the archives from catharticramble but will shortly.  I might make a book or some kind of journal out of them.  I have to go now and eat Chinese with Melissa.  I should have done work.  HA HA HA!

      Right now I am at work for the 12th hour of the day.  It is quite silly that I work so much. I never do anything else, it seems. I have no life of my "own" yet I am okay with that sometimes. I want to achieve perfection yet I can't quite let myself get there, it seems.  Really, I am hungry and thirsty, and too tired.  Melissa is meeting me at Ling Ling's so I can gorge on poorly cooked and unhealthy food while trying to figure out the nature of my day tomorrow...Wednesday...Thursday...and my DAY OFF on Friday that is creating more of a headache than if I just came in!  Grrr.  I have SO very much more to say. I never have the time to blog anymore, it seems.

      [7/30/2002 12:48:22 PM | Jenna Logue]Well, I am back from the funeral--worst week of my LIFE--and Boston. I will discuss the funeral, I am sure, throughout the next few weeks as I gradually process the information and emotional processes that I went through. Boston, though, was phenomenal! I had an excellent time and learned quite a bit about Jumpstart and myself. I went around alone on the first day there. It was the first time that I have ever felt truly comfortable with myself. It was quite an experience. Also, meeting new people and interacting with them went just about as smoothly as it ever has for me. That made me feel very good. The self-confidence is building and that is such a relief. Well, I surprisingly don't feel like blogging right now. I just wanted to have a little posting letting folks know that I was back. [edit] [7/16/2002 3:54:40 PM | Jenna Logue]My mom's brother died very unexpectedly last night. It's horrible. He just turned 50 in March. Everybody is shaken. It's horrible. Just a posting in case anybody wonders where I have gone for the next two weeks. After I go home today for the rest of the week, I have a training in Boston that I need to do for the new aspect of my job. I was looking forward to Boston but things don't seem to matter much anymore.

      So, I don't know what I feel worse about:  abandoning my students during their first AR session or the fact that I have not really organized my files yet today.  Of course, I can also throw in all of the other half assed things I have done this semester.  Graduate school, here I come!  Don't get me started.  Basically, I just don't know what's wrong with me. Nothing, probably.  I just want to get some sleep and things will be better!

      So, there's this huge event on campus/in our city on Saturday.  Members of my office staff (okay, so EVERYBODY in our office) are involved in the planning committee and we're all (okay, SOME of us are) here tonight working on various menial tasks and some that are not so menial...  I am honestly dead tired but at the same time, it isn't that bad.  My office space is relatively neat right now and I have done most of the things I need to do for my actual directly related to me project. As usual, I am in charge of the kid stuff.  Literally!  We're doing this huge Kids' Service Festival in honor of the 10th year of this Day of Service.  It seems like it will be a great time... if it goes like it is supposed to, that is.  Anyway... I will definitely keep up to date on here as much as I can.  I am taking a class.  It's not anything overly in depth but it is really thought provoking and I truly enjoy it.  We're looking   Oops..left this open on my screen.  Lovely.

      I was in NYC this weekend. It was a wonderful opportunity to explore the city during what little time the fine organization with which I was training provided us with "free-time."  Of course, that is okay because basically, the less time I had, the less money I could spend!  Ha!  No, seriously, though, NYC was nice. It was good to have somebody else doing all the thinking and I was on my toes only when I was looking over people's heads to watch the spray paint art man do cool things with spray paint, a water bottle cap, and a scraper.  I am impressed and half contimplated giving up my fine job as a college administrator to make such beautiful pieces of art on a street corner over-looking the beautiful Hudson River.  Then, after that experience, we walked to the infamous "Ground Zero."  It was breathtaking.  Approaching the corner where St. Paul's Chapel is heightened my senses because, I soon realized, there was very little sound.  I am not sure if there was literal quiet or more of an internal kind of quiet, the kind where my brain shut out all other extraneous sounds so I could dedicate all my energy to the emotions that burst forth from somewhere deep within.  The wall with all of the various items of clothing, paper cranes, hats, fire helmuts, teddy bears, dried flowers, signs, pictures, notes, drawings...the list goes on, was the most immediate vision.  Then, after I took in all of that, first noticing the paper cranes by the 1000's, I noticed the vendors.  They were selling pictures, computer programs, NYPD/NYFD hats, t-shirts, postcards, books about 9/11, and many more seemingly morbid items.  The 9/11 version of Enya's "Only Time" seemed to be coming from the air.  The song was truly was everywhere.  Until we made our way down the block and across the street.  Then, the flood lights.  Silence.  No crowds.  A pretzel vendor.  It was truly NYC.  The silence was eerie because the city had been bustling everywhere else I had been. One of the other people at my training, a girl who attends Barnard, said that she avoids Ground Zero; most New Yorkers do.  I don't blame them.  Of course, I am not a resident of NYC and I almost feel guilty that I had not seen Ground Zero until now.  I feel kind of un-American.  Not anymore, though, I have now shed my obligatory tear on the ground where so many lost their lives.    I couldn't help but take pictures. I felt like I needed to have them.  I want to share them with everybody I know. Everybody who didn't have the chance to get there and see.  I want to keep them. I want to frame them.  To remember.  I don't know why.  I just feel this need.  I also felt a need to find the name of the member of my graduating class who died in the World Trade Center.   There were three Hobart graduates.  None from William Smith.  I am obsessed with the name of the student from my year.  Scott W. Rohner.  One of the banners that listed every name caught my eye and so I found his name and wrote.  I left my mark.  We also put a Jumpstart pin on one of the NYFD t-shirts. We wanted to make sure it stuck to something.  It's not to feel good about ourselves. It's just to do something. Anything.  To make sense of it all.  I have to work now. I will add more later.

        And I'm PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN WHERE AT LEAST I KNOW I'M   FREE  ...     I don't know what I think about this shooting thing. I think it's related to the terrorists. I mean, duh, how could it  not  be?  They're creating terror in the minds of all Americans who are doing just what our beloved leader told us to do...goinging about our daily lives and doing our normal thing.  So, if I were a terrorist with any brains at all, I would do something like start shooting people at random in normal, everyday places like the bank, post office, etc.  Also, the two that didn't die, probably were intentional because this person or these people (the snipers) are seemingly perfect shots.  They would be able to kill if they intended to.  Of course, I am NOT a terrorist and I wouldn't even fathom shooting anybody for any reason. SO...I don't know where that came from.  I am just frustrated. I am always afraid to go to the gas station and the bank because of normal American morons who hold such places up.  Now I have to worry about terrorists doing the same thing only in a much more calculated yet random fashion.  Go figure.  So, enough about that.  It's too depressing.  Okay, so life... I am at work and it's nearly 5 but I have tons to do because I am taking two days off and having a FOUR DAY WEEKEND!  I am so excited.    Today:  I am going to finish working until about 5:30.  Then, I will go to my car and drive over to the lot near where my class is tonight and read ...  OKay, it's 5  CRAP... I just got "delayed" by a somewhat important phone call.  It frustrates me when I cannot do what I want to do...when I should do it.  ANYway...  Time to get work done and then fly like a moron as usual.  Peace.

      So...I am at work "late" but at least it's not to do work. I am going to organize things in a bit but I wanted to set up my new work laptop. This thing rocks.  I love my own laptop but this one is the most amazing yet.  It's got a bigger screen and it's the normal screen, like mine.  It's silver! It's got a Pentium 4... Very impressive. I also will have more room on my desk.  The only thing is...I have to get used to typing on a laptop keyboard again. I miss using mine. I will have to play at home.   Anyway...This sniper thing is getting out of control again. The quote about children not being safe anywhere, etc... I wondered why there were cops outside of the schools here. I mean, we're like 800 miles away from the DC area and everything.  Of course, I am still convinced it's "the terrorists."  Duh.  America is not immune.  My medication is out and I haven't taken it in two days so I get light headed and nauseated and confused. I feel like I am floating above myself if I don't drink enough water. Basically, it sucks.  Let's see..what else...I need to purchase something to keep this up at a much higher level.  I can't wait to organize the desk so I have a great office space.  Ah life. Sometimes I like my job.  I don't know what else to talk about but I have so much I could do right now. I have to organize so many things on my desk. I could go shopping and purchase a thingy to raise this up about a foot so it's at eye level.  I have to go tomorrow to the preschool center and drive somebody so I should clean out my car. UGH.  This not having my pills in me thing screws me up major.  I want to just go get them but I can't because my bank card won't work for some stupid reason. I still think the woman at Friendley's typed $140 instead of $14 and that's why it wouldn't work.  I have more than enough money in the bank so I won't ever understand why it comes back like that.  Grumble.  Let's see...I guess I am boring.    Work or drive home?  That is the question.

        Agony!    (Gotta love  Into the Woods ...)   Oh, the  agony ... On so many levels, in fact!!  Well, let's see...I woke up feeling drugged and I don't know why.  It's not like I am! I gave blood yesterday and that's not supposed to have anything to do with it but of course, I am now convinced that it does because it's the only thing that I did differently yesterday as opposed to any other day.  That's the personal level...one aspect of that, anyway.  Professional:   Endless Agony  So, let's see, I work for somebody who is a wanna be jack-ass but is a nice guy deep down.  It's annoying and right now I am sitting here listening to him meet with the most obnoxious student in the world.  A druggie, sex-crazed, stupid, manipulative, jack-ass sitting here acting like he's the fucking central of the universe and my supervisor practically kisses his ass. I wouldn't want to be this guy if you like paid me to be!  It's sickening.  Honestly, he's an ass!  This guy is just one of those people that makes me want to scream because he is so pretentious. BEYOND pretentious.  $1.2 million apartment aspirations and all.  My one new "baby" is driving me crazy.  I have to just take a chill pill, sit down and actually relax, organize some more files, and just calm down.  It's not really that bad, when I think about it rationally (whenever I allow myself to be rational).  Of course, at the same time, I am constantly forced to wonder how exactly I allowed myself to talk myself into this crazed schedule of employing 120 people and still doing other miscellaneous tasks on top of it all.  It's NOT that I do not appreciate the extremely wonderful experience that I am gaining from having this job. That's not it at all.  I just cannot stand the thought of burning out, running myself into the ground, or running half assed programs.  I am at risk of all three and unfortunately, I am only able to watch it happen from my sleep deprived, constantly unmotivated state of not eating or drinking enough on a daily basis.  Hmmm...healthy am I?  I think not.  So, what else is agnoizing these days?  I dunno.  Some of the interpersonal relationships that I am dealing with are quite frustrating.  Of course, when I sit on my couch and spew nastiness, what else is to be expected? I have the desire to set people off, I think. Of course, that's healthy!  Ha ha.  NOT.  That's agony on an entirely different level.  I shouldn't be nasty.  It's nasty and self-depricating.  Well, work is work.  My lunch break at the computer is over yet again.  I should eat during lunchtime instead of sitting in front of this lovely new laptop and writing my deepest thoughts and feelings down for the entire world to see if they wanted.  Of course, the big brother software in my computer is probably broadcasting this to the entire campus comptuer center and contributing to the log against me that will falsly accuse me of spending time online all day.  Kind of like how Eva was falsly accused of the same thing. Funny how that works, isn't it?  I would love to have them try and accuse me of not doing my job and of being unprofessional.  That's the largest load of bullshit they could ever pull.  Bring it on suckers.   On second thought, please don't.  I just want to live a happy life. Besides, if I get fired for blogging during lunch, that's ridiculous and I would get the ACLU after them for discrimination based on sexuality.  It would be a viable case.  I could be the patron saint of lesbians.

      Hello world...  I am exhausted and have a TON of work to do so I shouldn't be here or online or anything. I should be at home with the new book I am borrowing from a co-worker/mentor of mine.    Anyway, I just wanted to share my pride with posting this exciting new little meter thingy on my blog.  Nadia had one on hers so I decided to post it on mine.  I like this. I am now going to play with posting more fun things on here. My blog now owns 25% of me!  Ha ha.  EEEK meeting in 15.

        Happy Halloween!!    So, as I was saying last night... I wish I had more time to enter things into this journal.  Right now, I am at work, as usual at this time of the day.  I am just so down about life that I need to take this time to write for myself.  I don't get a lunch break so this is it.    I find the CNN.com site to be interesting that it is covering the slaying of a rapper over anything else.  I haven't read the circumstances so perhaps it is truly that newsworthy.  Anyway, times, they are a changin'.  It is a sad day in the world of Run DMC fans, I am sure.   Moment of Silence.   So, as I drove into work this morning, there were a lot of dead animals.  I bless them with the sign of the cross.  It makes me sad that so many animals get hit by cars and thus die such a horrible, public, bloody death.  It must be quite a distressing way to go, I would imagine.  Seeing all of those dead animals makes me sad but it also makes me appreciate the living ones that I see.  Living out in the country as I now do gives me many chances to see animals that were previously only viewed during family vacations to Allegany State Park.  I don't know why this is something so very thrilling to me (seeing "wild animals" so close to my home) but it is always a huge high when I see them.     The Thrill of the  Wild   So, a few months ago when it was still so hot that we had all of the windows open at our house, we heard  coyotes .  I was beyond thrilled.  It made me practically elated, in fact.  I have seen one coyte in my lifetime (all 23 years) and it was quite a few years ago, probably nearly 13, in fact.  We saw it walking down "Thunder Rocks Road" and we threw peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to it from the car windows.  It was so exciting for us! We had all been coming to Allegany for our respective lifetimes and hadn't ever been graced with seeing such a unique and uncommon site.  Even then, I felt blessed.  It is a moment that is frozen in my mind.  It is something that I go back to whenever I am outside or see something special.    Needless to say, then, when I heard them at my very own home while sitting in my bedroom writing in my journal and then writing a letter to Eva, I was giddy.  I was brought back in time 13 years and became that excited 10-year-old all over again.  If it hadn't been dark, I probably would have run outside, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in hand, to see if I could catch a glimpse of the beautiful creatures.  Imagine! Coyotes where I live.  Was my new home now up in the ranks with the special, immortal Allegany State Park?     The Bluebird of Happiness  The other day, I was driving down Goose Street and there, to my left, was a real live actual bluebird.  The kind with the pink stomach.  The nearly extinct kind.  Not a bluejay.  A real live bluebird.  I was, again, elated!  Renee was in the car with me and she smiled at me like I was a little girl who had just seen Santa, the Easter Bunny, or some childhood fantasy character for the first time.  True, I probably did act nearly as excited as if that had been the situation.  Of course, I was justified!  I remember once on a trip with either middle school or high school I saw one with binoculars but nobody else saw it.  I am still convinced.  I remember that my mom was always excited at the prospect of seeing a bluebird.  Of course, I think my mom has finally seen one in (you guessed it!) Allegany.  They had been on the endangered list for quite some time so spotting such a magnificent creature was a special treat and a goal for many nature lovers.    Seeing this bluebird reminds me of two other things.  My uncle, Nick and the movie  K-Pax .  My uncle just died in July. It was unexpected and truly a horrible time in our family's history.  We have not yet recovered, probably never really will.  He had a great piece of land on the top of a hill.  For the 4th of July we'd go and watch all of the fireworks in the distance.  Sometimes, with binoculars, we could see Toronto from his hilltop in East Aurora.  It was his dream come true. He had birdhouses that were meant for bluebirds but were overtaken by swallows. I can't remember if they had any bluebirds or not (in the beginning) but in any case, I remember he was excited to see them when they came. Sometimes, he'd even call my mom just to tell her he'd seen one.  He had the excitement of a boy and the energy of one, too.    K-Pax  was a movie about a possible alien.  Kevin Spacy came in on a light beam and intrigued many in the psychologica/psychiatric world with his non-human ways.  The film was truly a good one and I do think seeing it more than once is something everybody should strive for.  One of the scenes involved the entire "patient-body" of the residential psych hospital looking excitedly out of their windows at the so-called "bluebird of happiness."  Prog had told one of the patients to look for the said bird but nobody really took this mission seriously (i.e. the staff didn't).  When, finally, one day there really was a bluebird outside, the entire place was elated.  Practically hysterical, but in a good way, of course.  It was a beautiful moment in the movie that was filled with such moments.     What is to come?    I ask myself this very question daily.  Should I?  Probably not. It can be said that it is a waste of energy.  Of course, I am never sure what I should do and what I shouldn't do in order to keep myself sane, stable, and slightly less depressed than I could be.  Lately, I feel just about drained all of the time. Nothing really gets me excited.  I do like my job but I do just an adequate enough job to keep myself looking busy, accomplished, and not too out of the loop/my mind.  Usually, it works.  When it doesn't, whatever goes wrong is easily repaired or ignored or brushed under the preverbial rug to be dealt with another day or never.  I am going to give blood today.  Or, at least, I am going to attempt to give blood.  I am on my medication now and I haven't had anything to drink or eat today (except chocolate) and I have high blood pressure and my normal body temperate is elevated. So, the declination factors are numerous.  I will, however, try.  Okay, well, I need to get out of here.  Oops.  So, the day goes on....and will go on, and on, and on...  Perhaps I will write more later.  As Avril says...   "Life's like this.  Uh huh.  Uh huh... Life's like this.  That's the way it is..."

       "Life's Like This.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.... Life's like this.  That's the way it is..."   Well...It's like this...     Mortimer  We have a mouse in the house.  We saw it yesterday walking in the ceiling on the clear panel for our light.  It was cute!  I am, of course, paranoid about many things mouse, now.  I am afraid of finding one in a state of non-living somewhere in the vicinity of my bare feet someday.  I am also afraid of finding teeth marks in something that is supposed to be my food.  Of course, as long as it doesn't scare me or kill me, I think I will be okay.  Besides, it gives our lazy cats something to strive for.  Carnage.   Sleep Deprived  Well, I had wanted to talk about a ton.  Of course, I am not exhausted because instead of typing productive things in here, I was on IM with a friend of mine from when I was a little girl. Of course, I haven't seen her since I was probably ... 6?  I don't know...maybe I was younger when she moved out from the house across from ours in VA.  In any case, her brother just got married and she is recently graduated from college.  Very cool.  Time flies.  Good night. Hopefully, hopefully... I wish I could write more now.  Anyway, I am off to sleep with Melissa because I can't stand the thought of the couch and my bedroom looks like a tornado or a burgler struck.

       So, I picked up the group just fine. I drove the van just fine. Everything is A-Okay.      What Would You Do (ooo ooo) For a Klondike Bar?   Probably nothing. It's too damn cold right now!  I went out to do an errand and had to walk back... HOLY MOTHER OF FREEZING!    It's Not What You Can For the Morning.  It's What the Morning Can Do For You.  Tomorrow.  7:15 AM.  Me.  Two students.  Driving.  An hour.  I am not necessarily going to dispise the experience.  It's just that it's so damn early.  Why oh why must I be an insomniac?  I also have to remember to get breakfast for the group to eat on the way.  Group. Ha! There're three of us.  Oh, shit, I also have to clean out my freakin' car tonight in the dark, freezing, probably snowing night.  Oh well. That's the price I pay for the love of my job.  It's time for me to go.  I am going to read a little bit and then go over to my class. It's the night when we get to go to dinner. That is exciting to me. I am hungry. Today's the first day that I haven't had breakfast and lunch.  Bad me.  Oh well. I get dinner and then I get to go to my house and watch a movie and then go to bed.  Enjoy the weekend, faithful reader.  I will update you on Sunday or Monday about how Angela Davis inspired me.  Hopefully, I will not be writing from a jail cell.    Peace.

      F R E E  F L O W  of  I N F O   Finally, my page is back up.  I want to add a site meter to this but I don't think I will bother because it will give me another addiction and distraction.  Not like I need either of those!!  I have to drive one of those unsafe 15 person vans today. I am going to drop them off and then pick them up because I don't want to stay for three hours. Does that make me a bad supervisor?  Probably not. I need to let them feel encouraged to do their own thing and confident that I trust them.  Of course, two of the girls are sick. That means all of the kids are probably sick and then all of the rest of the staff will be sick and the kids at the other center will probably be sick and then all of my other students, too.  That means the elementary schools in the three districts are probably contagious in some way, too, and then the other 85 of my 120 will get sick, too.  Isn't that lovely?  Maybe I will get sick.  Maybe I am a carrier of everything and I get other people sick without really getting sick very often myself.  Of course, there was that time last year around this time or maybe in the winter. I don't know when it was.  But anyway, I got strep throat really bad and I was puking and everything and I was freezing and sick and it was horrible and I shudder just thinking about it.  My doctor didn't give me antibiotics right away because she thinks I am a hypochondriac (which I am not, thank you very much) so she just let me out into the world, sick, dying, and everything in between.  THREE DAYS LATER I was finally put on anti-biotics when my throat culture came back. She only took one because I had told her I was exposed to it.  I think I lied about that because I knew I had it and wanted to make sure I was properly diagnosed.  Whatever. I never get sick and when I do, I GET SICK.  I also know my own body and can tell you what I have when I am sick.  Thank you very much Ms. MD.  10 minutes until I have to walk over and get that stupid van.  I hate driving that stupid van.  I really hate driving that stupid van.  It is a pain in the ass when I have to leave the comfort and distraction of my office to go into the world and become human again.  It's even a sunny day today. NOT that I mind the sun, usually, but it's been so dark and gloomy for so long that my seasonal affective disorder is kicking in and causing me to become depressed and agitated at the mere suggestion of different weather or changes in the weather. I am a weather watcher. A junkie for the meterological report on the news. A www.weather.com addict.  It's not hypochondria.  Thank you very much.  I get to go out to dinner tonight.  Hopefully it won't be too traumatic and it won't take too long. It's not on my office budget so I should be excited.  Of course, I am; I just have to get worked up.  When I actually get to the place I have to be, I don't usually mind it.  Of course, today when I have to drive the group, I am not staying with them because that's annoying to spend 3 hours when I should be here preparing to be gone tomorrow all day from the office. Of course, I am getting more comp time built up tomorrow and Saturday. I leave campus at 7:15 tomorrow morning and won't get back until 11 pm and then have to leave at 8:30 Saturday morning and won't get back until 9pm.  Um, yeah. That's just how I want to spend my weekend.  Makes me tired just thinking about it.  Of course, I shouldn't complain too much. Free food is involved and I will get a mileage check from the deal.  Of course, I also have to clean out my car, get up before 6am, lose a relaxing weekend (because I haven't done that enough already this year), and be "on" representing my fine alma mater/employer.  But, I also get to hear Angela Davis speak.  That'll be cool and motivating.  Of course, I am still not sure if it justifies the other list's existence.  Okay, well, walking over to get the damn van I am.  I am dropping them off, spending 2.5 hours in my office, and then picking them up.  That will make me happy.  Um, happier.  Um, less depressed.  um, whatever.  I wish I knew how to put links to the blogs of my friends.  My friends link to this page and the one that died when the template didn't get reinvented.  I should look into that. Not now, though.  Now I am walking over to get the death trap and then driving up to the school, dropping them off, driving the death trap back here, parking it somewhere illegal for 2.5 hours, and then picking them up again.  Oh, the lovely thoughts. I am also going to have to get gas in it.  Grrrrrrrrrr-eat!

         Good Morning   I slept on the mattress on the livingroom floor again because my bedroom is still in the cleaning stages.  My floor is fine but my bed has the clothing piled high.  Finding clothing for this weekend is going to be a bitch because I have um, nothing clean.  Really.  I have a conference on Friday and Saturday that I need to dress for and I have a Jewl concert on Sunday that I want to look appropriate for.  I think I have a pair of jeans that are wearable but not the ones I would decide to wear to a concert like that. Well, this is pointless information.  I am at work right now preparing for the day.  I have been here for over an hour, I got in on time.  It feels good to get things done.  I cleaned out my portfolio.  Yesterday I finished creating a filing system for one of my drawers.  Oh, the joys.  Last night when I got home, I actually finished the book I am reading for my class that meets on Thursdays.  Well, I have like the last 25 pages left but, well, that's okay.  But, I felt so productive!  I read for about an hour and a half. Then, I went to bed to the sounds of the Barbara Walters interview with the Osbourne family.  Wow.    Lately, I have been having such awful nightmares. They all make me feel so uneasy and they're all very random combinations of people, places, and events.  My mind must really be working through severe issues.  I wish I could figure out if they actually mean anything.  Perhaps they don't, though.  Still, they're getting scarier and leaving me feeling much more "out of it" when I wake up from them.  The one I remember the most vividly from last night is very strange.  A very strange combination of people was in a tour bus with my supervisor driving.  The bus tipped over and fell partially over a drop off that went down to the ocean.  We were dangling there for a few minutes before they came with a tow truck to pull us up.  When they pulled us over, the bus fell onto the parkinglot and I (only I was not myself, I was this girl Emily) broke my collar bone.  Everybody was fine except for me.  When I was in the hospital, this other girl came to visit me. She was allegedly my girlfriend except she's dating a different Emily than the Emily I was supposed to be in the dream. VERY strange.  Anyway, I don't even know where that all came from.  One of the other dreams that I remember vaguely (from a few nights ago) involved the ocean, too.  In fact, a lot of them have. I should look up what that could mean.  Anyway, one of the school vans was driving on the beach (maybe I was driving, I don't remember) and got caught in the current and kept washing up and being pulled back into the sea. It was weird.    So, that's the randomness in my head.  No song lyrics for that title...at least none that I can think of.  Well, work beckons, as always.  Tonight I have my class and we're going out to dinner. I want to find a piece to share with the class before then but I doubt I will find the time.  I should get things ready for this conference tomorrow and Saturday.  I have to realize how much it actually involves.  I need to also remember to take pictures of some aspects of it so my supervisor can live vicariously.  He's at the national version for three days. I am at the state version for two days driving 1.5 hours each way from my house instead of staying at a hotel.  The 4-way mileage check will be more or the same as one night in a hotel!  Oh well.  It's not my money, it's the office's.

        Welcome to the Real World She Said to Me...  Condenscendingly...     So, I voted yesterday and hoped that maybe my vote would actually make some kind of a difference.  Well, I should have known.  Our country is now completely controlled by the Republicans and their pocketbooks.  Very Encouraging.    I have the right to complain;  I VOTED .  These two women in the gas station this morning were all like "What difference does it make who is in office?  They're all the same these days.  That's why I don't vote anymore."  My skin was crawling because that is the attitude that gives Americans a bad name.  That is the reason why only 1/3 of eligible American voters botherd to show up to the polls yesterday.    Don't even get me started on Florida's situation.  I was driving to work yesterday with my usual NPR on the radio.  I was running late so I was still actually in the car when  Democracy Now  came on the air.  They discussed how this voters' rights NPO was monitoring the polls and had already witnessed some obscene number of illegal scenarios.  Not to mention the fact that they themselves weren't allowed to stand the legal 50 feet away from the actual ballots themselves.  It is either Florida or Federal law that poll monitors can stand 50 feet away from the actual spot where the ballots are cast but some of the officers were forbidden to be that close.  Thus, another illegal action was taken.  I could go on.  I don't, however, have the time.  NO TIME ONE HOUR LEFT AT WORK WILL NOT STAY LATE MUST GO NOW

         TGIF    Today I volunteered myself to be the staff person accompanying a group of students in the college vehicles to Rochester for an event they're staffing as volunteers.  So, woe is me, again, because now instead of hanging out tonight, I have to galavant around Rachacha by myself.  I won't work with them, not just because they're not being fed, but also because I don't want to get all gussied up and look pretty.  Blah.  Perhaps I will go see  Harry Potter Two  or perhaps another film.  Perhaps I will shop 'til I drop or perhaps I will just drop.  Ha ha.  I might even see if Alex is available to hang out but I doubt that.  We'll see.  They best part?  They're not done until midnight.  Grumble.  SO, that's my life.  Life as a person who is too nice.  Saturday we're going to Koshare, the annual student dance show. I am going to insist on getting there early enough to get decent seats.  There're a few things this weekend that I want to go to and I just have to decide.    Right now, I am trying to stay awake.  I can go home between driving them there and driving them back.  Or, I can just make myself even MORE tired by hanging around all night in Rachacha.  We shall see.  Okay, back to finish my grant proposal.  Then, interview with the girl from the paper about my program........then where?  Home to sleep?  NOPE...Off to Rachacha to play with the kiddies or something like that.    Joy of joys.

        Woe is me.  I wonder what Thursday's Child is.   Since I was born on a Sunday, I am ... hmmm, wonder what the Internet says.    Okay, so here's what I found.  Interesting.  Notice what it says for Sunday's child.  On the site I took this from, they had "happy" in parentheses.  I opted to remove that because I like it better this way...                                                      Monday's child is fair of face                                                    Tuesday's child is full of grace                                                   Wednesday's child has far to go                                                    Thursday's child is full of woe                                                   Friday's child is loving and giving                                                 Saturday's child will work for a living                                                 A child that is born in the Sabbath day,                                             Will be handsome, good, rich, and gay.  So, that's that.  I am procrastinating again.  I will be here 'til nearly 7pm tonight because Renee has my car until then. Grrr.  I wish I had my reader's college but instead there's a meeting at 6:30 that I should go to but don't want to force Renee to wait longer, though I had to wait for her today.  Whatever.  I have tons to say but will save it for home if I blog later tonight.  I am so tired right now. I am also sick to my stomach because the guy in our office that comes in occasionally to bitch at my boss ... he (the boy) smells like cigarettes and bad cologne and something else.  It's gross.  More later.

       I was reading Melissa's blog (http://opportunity.blogspot.blogger.com) and realized that she wrote "Hooray for sex."  On the day that she and I had sex this past weekend. Aw, I feel special now.  She cared.  Now, don't get me wrong, I had intended to keep this site clean as I don't remember who has the link and who reads it regularly...  Taking a walk and eating lunch.  More later.

        Oh Wednesday's Child, you have proven yourself Wrong.  Though, I do feel exhaustion...   That's my cheesy subject line for the lunch break, as opposed to my pre-work blog.  I just got off of a phone call with all of the people at my secondary employer.  I am just overwhelmed with all the crap they expect from me.  Considering they're coming next week, I should get working on updating files, etc.  There is just so much stuff. I feel bad for my larger program and for my personal life.    My poor personal life.  Poor, poor, poor, personal life...  I am over-stressed and over-worked.  I don't know how to say "NO" to offers of "fun" activities with friends or co-workers or my boss and his family. Although, none of it will kill me.  Besides, that which doesn't kill you will make you stronger.  Okay, there's a girl coming at 3 for a meeting. It's nearly 2. I have TONS of shit to do so I will go now. Blogging occasionally keeps me relatively sane and keeps me feeling productive because the act of typing makes me feel like I am doing something important.  I should write my book soon.  Just keep up with a page or so a day.  That would be fun. I would be published before grad school.  I should also research grad school. Icky.  Love to the world.  Peace.

         Wednesday's Child is Full of  Woe ?    It had  damn well  better not be!   So, this day has started off pretty well and I do hate to jinx that by blogging so early along!  Of course, it might help me get it all out of my system.  I have to be on the phone with people from my  favourite  organisation today from 11-1:30 practically the entire time.  Can you sense the excitement that I radiate?  I had breakfast. Renee got me a bagel on the way to drop her off at work. I feel so bad for her because her boss is nuts and is essentially gaslighting her and Renee feels helpless and there's nothing I can do.  It is ridiculous and nobody should work under those circumstances.  So, hopefully next week things will improve for her. Of course, that would mean finding a dream job in less than a week and interviewing for it and getting it so she can give her two weeks and get the f&$*# out of the other pit.  Melissa is depressed and is trying to get us all to feel guilty because of our so called privilege.  Um, yeah.  That hurts when somebody you care deeply for feels so alone and feels like she is persecuted by everybody on the planet and truly believes it. I do realise that she is coming from a difficult background but at the same time, she has no right to tell me that Renee and I have no right to be depressed because we grew up with different kinds of lives than she (Melissa) did.  Um, just because our mothers aren't druggies who have been married to 4 ass holes and abuses her children emotionally and occasionally physically does NOT meat that we haven't had our share of hard times and family related stress.  She has no right to claim any kind of hierarchy of oppression.  Audre Lorde said it herself.  I guess Melissa must be so depressed that she doesn't realize that her statements are unfair, hurtful, and truly ridiculous.  Of course, until she seeks therapy/counseling, she will not be at a point where she can realize these things ...  Okay, work beckons.  We're listening to Les Miserables (I wish I could do accents!) so now I am happier.

         Tuesday's Child is Full of Grace     Oh, it had damn well better be...   Okay, guess I lose.  I was going to write about how it sucks to watch my best friend so down because she hates her boss because her boss in insane and makes her life miserable because she lies and makes up stories and people believe them because why would somebody in her position lie?    But...  Now...I am going to briefly bitch about this fine Tuesday morning that just got better with the phone call that interruped my starting lines...  I wish that students and staff and faculty and everybody loved this place as much as I do. I wish that everybody was as responsible as I am.  I wish that everybody was able to take responsibility and I wish that not everybody was so freakin' stupid about things. I wish that people didn't make my life hell because they can.  I wish that I didn't have to deal with stupid people.  I wish that the world was a literate, cultured place full of people who have a love of learning and a love of life.  People who are miserable suck.    Now, that said.  I guess it could have been worse.  At least the woman who called me didn't bitch me out. At least she doesn't have the authority to like, get me fired.  Also, it's not me...it is usually my students that cause the problems so all she has to do is tell me about it. She doesn't have to deal with it.  Okay. Better now.  Okay, lots has happened. It's 10:30 already.  Grrrumble.  Gotta work.

      Monday.  Today is Monday and it lived up to all of the horrible stereotypes of Monday.  Especially Mondays that are following a long weekend due to time out of the office for work-related purposes.    I left on Thursday to go to my class and then go to bed early because we had the weekend conference at 7:15 the next (Friday) morning. I haven't seen my keys since 9 a.m. on Thursday.  That sucks.  BIG time.    So, this weekend, I was key-less (TGFSK--thank goodness for spare keys!) and tired.  The highlight, yes, Renee, I mean it, was the Jewel concert yesterday night.  Not only did she wear leather pants but she sang her best stuff and I was so glad to have had that experience.  Very thrilling.  This morning, I was greeted with the reminder that I didn't have my freakin' keys.  Then, I was greeted with unpleasant e-mails.  Then, yes, there's more, I was greeted with time sheets STILL IN THE OFFICE because I forgot to sign them.  Just one god damn thing after another.  I can't believe it.  I just can't win!  I am leaving now.  To go home.  I am bringing work with me.  I have too much to do. I am not getting myself down, though. HAHAHAHA...I might just go crazy, though.  How in the world did I get so behind?

      So far I don't feel too much like shooting myself, yet.  I am still at work, though, and should go home. I think I will. I am tired and hungry.  I want to talk to somebody about something mindless.    Tomorrow more of the same.  site visit day #2...dun dun dun... (Ominous music playing...)  I promise more when I am less frazzled and stressed.  I think Friday night will definitely call for a drinking binge of some sort.  Sorry, Renee, I know how you feel about such things.  :-)

      Today I discovered the blog that Renee created long ago and I had never read.  It is found at:   http://soupalphabet.blogger.com   and is very thought provoking.  Today I also discovered that I want to go home RIGHT NOW and cannot stand the thought of sitting at this desk, working at this job, visiting one of my teams, and then going home, too drained to really do much of anything.  Thanksgiving is upon us very soon and I just want to go home and see my family and have good food.  I wish I had a real break instead of this quick, glorified weekend version of a break that teases us into complacency for a few days until we are reminded what the daily grind truly feels like.  In Renee's blog, she wrote about "Good Friday" and it has made me think about holidays and what our society defines as such.  Take Thanksgiving, for example.  Native Americans (North Americans, mind you) were exploited by exiled Europeans for a few acres of land and some fishing space.  Let's all give thanks that we are free now because of this brave act of heroism.    Two sentences.  The cynic's perspective.  The Pilgrims were expelled from Europe by evil zealots who wanted nothing to do with this "religious freedom" business.  They landed on a land occupied by animals and savage natives who had not yet seen way of the Lord.  The Pilgrims saved these savages, mind you they infected them with diseases and stole all their food in the process, by showing them "the way."  On the last day, they sat down, broke bread and gave thanks....  Hey, wait, that last line, it sounds familiar...  Some white dudes and dudettes came to the New World to attain religious freedom.  They discovered that their precious land was already inhabited so they decided to live in harmony with them and share food, land, and women in a glutton-like way. Hmm...That version sounds interesting.  Did the males and females share the women, or was that a prize reserved especially for the most pious of the males?  Were they really trying to attain religious freedom or did they get kicked out for being wack-o, even back in the day of other zealots?  Did they really live in harmony with the Native Americans as we were taught in school?  Or, did they kill and brutalize the Native Americans, like we were also taught in school--sometimes within the same week as hearing the other version of the story?    No wonder Americans are conflicted with truth and untruth, good and bad, good and evil, right and wrong, morals and sins...  My goodness... whatever shall we make of this Thanksgiving thing, anyway?  I mean, where do we start?  Who do we believe?  Did anything of the sort ever happen?  Why do the Canandians all of a sudden have their own Thanksgiving?  I mean, what is up with this creation of a holiday?  Is the principle behind it anything more than just reminding people that they need to concentrate on the good in their lives, for at least one day?  Is it anything other than a forced excuse to sit down with those we love and share our thanks and love and appreciation?  Is it anything more than that?  Why does everything have to have a place in history in order to be legitimate?  Why do people insist on creating stories upon stories upon stories just to make up reasons to be thankful, happy, and giving?  I mean, is it that bad to just be thankful, happy, and giving because you WANT TO?  Do you really need the country to give you permission by creating some story from years upon years of truths/lies/etc. and boiling it down into one day where all kinds of people sat down together and gave thanks for the harvest?   Wake up and smell the turkey, folks, it didn't happen like that.  Feasts of thanks have been going on for years and years in all parts of the world.  Yes, they happen in the fall quite frequently because, gasp, that's when many countries in the world experience the end of the growing season.  Imagine that.  People being thankful for something as simple as having food to eat (or sell or export to those "less fortunate" (um, more fortunate) or feed to cows or feed to chickens or burn as waste when it isn't eaten ... while people starve to death...)  Imagine that.

        Happy Thanksgiving (belated, of course)!  Happy December!  Well, it's been a weird day.  I got home yesterday from a great weekend with my family.  Truly a nice time away from my life of work and all that goes with being an adult.  :-) I hung out with Renee, played Monopoly--kicked her ass!!, watched something on TV, and then went to bed.    This morning, I slept past my alarm but didn't care.  I called work to let them know that I would be in between 9:30 and 10 because I had errands to run--bank to deposit the check my parents gave me (finally they're almost finished paying me off!!!) and to the post office to get stamps.  The holiday stamps this year are snowmen. I am not sure how I feel about them, though.  At least I have them so I can send my 50+ Christmas cards soon.    Well, anyway...I got up and was JUST about to get into the shower when Renee screamed my name from the livingroom.  I walked out and she said "What should we do with it? It's right there and they're knocking everything down."  I was like "What is it?"  Well, it was a baby mouse. Yes, lovely, right?  It  was  adorable, though.  Anyway, Maya was trying to catch it and she just wouldn't give up. She was about 6 inches too short, standing on the speaker on her hind legs, stretching her front legs all the way up, towards the ceiling tile.  The mouse was sitting with its little tail hanging down from the metal part that keeps the tiles together.  We have that cheesy kind of ceiling that's made up of those icky white tiles and we have the flourscent light panels.  Yummy...anyway, it was strange.  The poor little mouse was just making itself as small as possible.  It was so adorable!  Anyway, we now know that Maya is definitely our little "mouser" because Yuki and Max were ignoring it.  Max was asleep on the tower and Yuki was sitting, watching the situation unfold, occasionally bathing herself.   So, I finally managed to get Maya away from the entertainment center and into the diningroom to forget about the baby mouse (it was just about an inch and a half or MAYBE two inches and it had fur...the tail was longer than the mouse!!) ...  I tapped on the wall and it ran, but the wrong way (towards the part of the ceiling tile that met the metal part again) so, I then tapped the side behind it.  Finally, the little thing turned around and had its little face towards us (whiskers twitching and everything!!!) and then made its way back into the ceiling, where, I am afraid to say, it was met by a family of at least 2 other mice.  I saw little heads and tails greet it and then they ran together.  So, we definitely have to get ourselves some canisters.  Metal or glass.  We can coexist with them but I am telling you, it makes me kind of nervous.  I don't know why. I mean, they're cute and I hate the thought of killing them or trapping them. So, the first two casualties are probably now survived by at least 10 others.  Isn't that a fun thought?  Our walls will become invested.  Um, at least they're not bugs, snakes, or rats.  THAT would make me truly disgusted and nervous.  So, the mouse situation was solved.  I took my shower.  I then went to the post office and bought stamps and to the bank.  First, though, I got gas. My tank was empty on the way home!  Oops.  I arrived at work to check my 63 e-mail messages.  I read one from Melissa saying:      Hey... I just tried calling you guys at the house like a million times but no one's picking up (no answering machine either).  I just got back from ICU at UMASS Medical, where my father is.  He got into a car crash at 2 a.m. yesterday morning.  He's on a ventilator and everything.  More later, I guess, when I get back.      Whoa.  That freaked me out to no end.  She's not exactly close to him but it's still her father, you know?  Wow.  That poor girl.  I can only imagine what it must be like.  Poor, poor thing.  Okay, well, I checked my other messages.  Nothing huge.  Okay, working, working, working...la la la...  Just about to start my blog during my mini-lunch break. Phone rings.  It's Melissa.  My stomach dropped.  Rightfully so, it turns out.  I asked her how she was and she said she'd been better.  Well, her car went off the road outside of Syracuse and she doesn't have AAA (yet).  THANKFULLY she and her car are both okay and no other cars were involved.  I can't imagine.  At least Renee gave her the cell phone to use in case of an emergency.  Poor, poor Melissa.  I think I should take her out to dinner tonight.  Somewhere nice.  Of course, I don't know what time she'll get home now that she's waiting in the snow for a tow truck to come and help her.  I hope there isn't any damage to that car. That would be the last thing she'd need.  If her father does die, I would take her home for the funeral.  I would hope that work woudl understand.  It's so sad.  Poor, poor Melissa.  Well, that's that.  Back to work.  It's still snowing here. I am going to check the radar to see what time to expect her, i.e. how much snow is falling between Utica and here.

       It's Tuesday.  Do you know where your brain is?  My is on overdrive right about now.  This week will be insane and next week, even more so.    I have the rest of this week, then next week, and then January 2-3 in the office before next semester starts.  SO...that makes for a fun filled, short period of time.  I am taking my laptop to CT for that week I will spend training, etc.    Grumble.    Back to work.  Just wanted to spend a minute to myself, typing something other than budgets, etc.

      Well, here we are, one week after my last post.  Nothing much new to report, I guess.    It's a Rich Man's World  I saw  Mamma Mia!  in Rochester on Saturday.  It was splendid and I am so very glad I had the chance to see it, even if we were in the second from the last row in the balcony.  Row X, not the Roman numeral for ten, that's the 24th letter of the alphabet "X."  $27.50 got us those seats.  Had we wanted to shell out a few more bucks, we could have been, as Renee said, close enough for the "actors to spit on us."  I had never really known much about ABBA except that the song  Dancing Queen was theirs.  This musical featured 22 ABBA songs and they were very well woven into a coherant story!  Very exciting show.  I now want the soundtrack...not an ABBA CD, though; somehow, I think that wouldn't be quite as appealing.  My parents are going to see the same show, same touring group, on the 21st.  They open in Buffalo on Tuesday, as in tomorrow, but my parents couldn't get tickets until the 21st. I don't know how much they're paying but they're undoubtedly sitting almost as far away as I was.      I do! I do! I do! I do! I do!  So, Nadia's wedding is soon.  I cannot wait to go!  Weddings are so much fun and I haven't yet been to one as an adult.  I was in one when I was 5, though.  A flower girl in a dress made my Mommy.  The pictures are adorable. I don't really remember much of the details from the actual day, though.  Nadia's dress has been ordered.  I wish she'd tell us about it.  Just because Jose isn't supposed to see it/know about it dosen't mean that none of us can know what to expect!  Actually, a surprise it will be anyway because a description won't exactly be like the real thing and a picture wouldn't be an actual representation of her in the dress.    I wish she'd register soon so I can get the gift.  I am such a nutcase about this wedding. You'd think it was my own, no not really. I would be an even bigger nutcase were that true!  We can't forget to get one of those pictures of all of us together so it can go into the  Pulteney Street Survey  under marriages!  There will be quite a few alumnae there and the bride is an alumna so...  Simone, Renee's friend, is getting married in August and Renee's going to be in the wedding.  I am jealous but, that's okay, I guess. I won't even be invited to that wedding so I won't be there to see Renee all bridesmaid'ed up.  Poor thing. I hope the dress isn't too frilly; though, knowing the bride, I tend to doubt it.    Back to work.  In ten minutes I am supposedly having one of my bi-weekly check in calls with my friend and yours...

        Sometimes I Feel Like I Don't Have a Partner   Yes, I realize that is a Red Hot Chili Peppers song from years ago but it just came into my head earlier and it's been there ever since; I just can't get it out of my head!  So, I figured since I can't sleep and am in the mood to socialize or do SOMEthing relatively exciting, I would go online from home, on my own personal laptop, later than I have been up and active in a few months.  What is this world coming to?    Anyway, I kind of feel like just rambling on tonight, ruminating on my heading, free flow of thoughts that come into my head, whatever, you know...  So, I have not technically been AT work doing actual work related to my own responsibilites in a week.  That does indeed make me extremely nervous and stressed because I have two days this week and two days at the very beginning of January to do a lot of random crap.  Spending a week in CT at a really cool resort place will not seem like a vacation at all if I have to bring work to do!  I mean heavy duty crap, too.  Only the best for yours truly.  My cats are taking decorations off of the Christmas tree in the diningroom.  The one in here is okay because I yelled at Max already.  Now, he thinks that just because I am typing and Melly is reading and Renee is sleeping, he can do whatever he wants.  Cats.  Renee is sleeping, has been since before 9.  Melissa is reading and grumpier than usual.  Max is attacking the Christmas tree and I don't know where his cohorts are.  Probably egging him on from the sidelines, only to appear completely innocent should a human enter their playfield.  I get to go home for Christmas soon.  That makes me immensely happy.  I wish I could spend longer but no, I have to get to CT for  a week and then, SCHOOL STARTS already.  Three weeks for winter "break?!??!?!"  Um, hello.  That is NOT healthy for the students, let alone the staff!  We don't get three weeks and can't really afford the time to take the entire week off after Christmas anyway because they're coming back so soon anyway.  So, I just lost the desire to blog.  I had somethings of consequence to say, I guess, but I lost them in my mind. Perhaps I am, imagine this, tired.

      Merry Christmas a few days after the actual day.  For those who celebrate Christmas, I hope you had a happy holiday and spent it with your loved ones close, healthy, and happy.  This year, my Christmas was happy.  Actually, I was thinking a lot about it and I don't think I have ever had an unhappy Christmas.  Really.  I am going back to my house the day before New Year's Eve.  I would go on the 31st but I have to clean up a lot of random crap, do laundry, clean my room, pack for CT, and prepare to spend two days at work doing about three weeks' worth of actual work.  I hope I can manage without falling into some deep, dark depression.  That reminds me...I need to find my prescription.  The cats came to my parents' house with me for Christmas. They've been really good. I have been letting them wander around upstairs except for in Matthew's room (allergies).  Yesterday and today, I left the door to the downstairs open for a few hours. They sat at the bottom of the steps while Kramer barked and whined at them from the other side of the cracked open door. Weird animals, they are.  Maya doesn't mind Kramer at all, really. She sat nicely on my lap while he snortled and sniffed her, trying to lick her ears off in the process.  Then he chased her into my mom's room and she hid under the bed.  My poor father was already asleep but had to be awakened because the cat can't stay there due to Mom's allergies.  Cats.  Right now Max is trying to commit suicide by jumping off of the ledge that is above the stairs.  He'd probably require emergency vet treatment.  Hopefully there's one around here that's open at this time on a Saturday morning/Friday night.  Cats.  We died my hair today.  It's not that drastic.  It's the color of blonde that it used to be when I was little.  I like it. I was going to do red but then chickened out.  Mom was excited in the store when I blurted out "Let's die my hair tonight."  She is so funny.    Now, Max is pleading with me. Meow/I'm dying.  Meow/I'm abused and neglected. Me-OW/pay attention to me or I will jump off of this ledge, taking some family heirloom with me so it can shatter to its/my/our death on the stairs below.  Me-OW/I am deaf.  Okay, she's ignoring me.  Moving over to the dresser where more glass family possessions are located.  Me-OW/evil laughter/this is GLASS.  Sniff. Meow.  Meow/I am going to do it.  Knocked over a vase.  Nothing is broken, except for his plan.  Little F*&%er.    Maya is on my lap now, purring sweetly. Max decided to fall asleep on a rug outside my brother's door.  He still looks slightly possessed so I oughten't get my hopes up that he'll sleep soundly tonight.  Let's see...I haven't done much except shop and hang out with my family.  The Christmas thang went well. I am happy with my new possessions.  Nobody went overboard and my grandmother only bought a few weird things--of course, I think most of them were for other people.  As I remember, most of my stuff from her was actually useful/normal/on my list!  Oh, Max is on the dresser again. A different one.  Wants to climb the wall.  I swear.  He is cunning.  Pretends to be deaf (and "special") so when he does something naughty, he will be forgiven more quickly.  Doesn't work with me, buddy.  I am on to your games.  Clever little thing...don't forget that I am very intuitive, though, and have you all figured out.  So, other than personifying my cats, I have cooked today. Shopped for tomorrow's family gathering (that will take place here).  Died my hair blonder.  And, now, will soon go to bed.  I have slept in a lot this week.  Anything past 8 is sleeping in and I have been sleeping until at least 9 am every single morning. This morning, somebody came home and played his guitar at 4 am because he was a temporary brain surgeon and thought that would be a good idea (turns out he was drunk, we won't go there, though). Needless to say, it woke me (and the cats!!!) up and then I (and the cats!!!!) couldn't get back to sleep so I slept until 11.  Oops.  Whatever, though, Mommy was off today (and is tomorrow and Sunday, too!!!!!!!!!!!!!) so we got a lot done in the late afternoon and early evening.  She's fun to shop with when she's in a good mood. Thankfully, today was a somewhat good mood.  I think she's in need of a new anti-depressant that focuses more on anxiety, though. Prozac is over-prescribed and other drugs are often ignored by doctors who are more familiar with the older ones.  My professional oppion.  HA!   So, once I get back to my house, I will have a ton of shit to do.  The girls and I are "doing Christmas" on New Year's day.  Should be fun.  I hope that Melissa didn't get me the Lord of the Rings boxed set.  Matthew did.  If she did, it's okay, though, I will probably never read either. After looking at the set I have (that the poor child payed too much for), it looks slightly annoying to read.  Unfortunately, I have now seen the first two movies and will have a hard time accepting the books as "real."  Of course, I can just separate them in my head and think of them as pleasingly similar.  The only HUGE disappointment that the books will bring...Liv Tyler isn't in the books. OH MY GOD SHE IS SO HOT.  The second movie took my breath away during her scenes.  My cousins were with me so I couldn't verbalize my excitement ... It's exciting thinking about it now.  HA!  Soon it will be 2003.  I can't believe it. It's just such a weird year.  I don't know that I have ever thought about it before but I know that 2003 isn't a year I thought much about when I was younger.  What will I be doing in 2003?  I mean, I probably wondered at some point about my 24th year on this earth but not in terms of 2003.  Actually, I think I focus more on my age than the year anyway.  Whatever.  My ability to think philosophically/deeply tonight is limited ... to what? I don't know.  But, limited it is indeed.  Hot girls.  Perhaps that is what it is limited to.  Doubtful.  I just have to say that lately I have been thinking a lot about women who are out there wanting to find the perfect someone.  What if I am the perfect someone for somebody who I don't even know?  What if we never find each other and both live out our lives with wonderful people who also never found their perfect someones?  I mean, this train of thought is definitely going to get me in a ton of trouble if two very wonderful, special, beautiful people read it and think too deeply about it.  Of course, I just have to wonder and I am seeming to pick this space as a place to wonder about this topic.  I am thinking a lot about what happens after a person dies. Where do they go? Is there somewhere where their soul goes and thus their consciousness?  Where? What is it like? Can they see or do they just feel/imagine? When our bodies die, do we just vanish and cease all everything?  What happens??????????  I don't want to know yet I just need to know for some reason. Just about nothing scares me as much as the thought of death and being alone after I die.  I mean, it's just weird to think about it.  I don't want to be buried. I do want to be cremated and perhaps sprinkled somewhere. Once place, though.  BUT...is my body it? When the brain goes does it send something out there that then becomes me?  Or, does the "me" cease existance when the physical heart stops beating and the lungs no longer fill with air?  WHAT makes us us?  Where is my "self?"  Do I remember my past? I don't know what to think, though, because what if my soul is indeed recycled from a past body's existence?  Why don't I remember that?  Will I forget the people that I have loved in this lifetime if I become a part of another physical space after this body dies?  Is that how it works? Or, is it like the movie What Dreams May Come?  I mean, what happens?  Then, there's Aida (modern day musical)... The two main characters come together at that museum and then remain together for eternity but in different physical bodies.  It all fascinates me completely.    Forgive the lack of proper punctuation for film and book titles. I am lazy tonight and don't remember the right html codes and I am too lazy to even highlight and select bold or italics for things that need them.  Okay, exaustion setting in.  I could go on forever but I am falling asleep and the cats are quiet so I should get to sleep now and hopefully remain that way until at least 9 am.  Peace.

       NATO may prepare Turkey defense    This is the CNN headline that comes up when I open my e-mail window.  This is just so laughable for many reasons... I will let you figure out your own reason to laugh at it.  So, today is Thursday but I won't be in the office due to a conference tomorrow.  So, today is Friday as far as being in the office but not really for the week because this weekend I will be babysitting on Saturday.  WHY did I agree to that?  Oh well. It will involve cute children and cats.  One of the children is even a BABY!  I love babies.    Right now I am craving Chinese food.  Hmmm...neither of my roommates will be home when I get there and I haven't been alone in ages.  So, if I go to eat, I will be eating what I am craving and I will be alone, sort of, but I will also risk getting home and finding one or both of them there.  If I go home, though, for dinner, what would I make?  I don't know what there is because things disappear in our house somehow.  Oh, the decisions.  Tomorrow, I have to be here with a cleaned out car by 7:45 a.m.  We're going to this conference.  Sometimes, the only thing I like about conferences is the free food.  Yummy!  During the spring break, I will be in North Carolina working at a school with some of the students from here.  I am not sure if I am going to play the role of "removed adult" who sort of appears to supervise every so often and doesn't jump in to work alongside the students or the "gung-ho adult" who excitedly participates as an equal.  Last year, I was participating with them, doing the service and working with the kids at the school, etc.  I did, however, pull the age card a few times and not do things that I didn't feel like doing.  I think that was a nice balance.  Of course, they lost all respect for me when I cried the entire way home and threw a fit about wanting to drive faster. Yeah, I think that is when I knew how much I needed those anti-depressants and the therapy!    So, let's see...it's 5pm.  I need to make a list for our students who are working tomorrow so that they have tasks to do in our absence.  Lovely.  There are only so many things I can come up with because of my own sloppy desk and messy filing system.    Too much to do to blog.  Figures.  Okay, to work and then to...um...somewhere.  Oh the decisions!

       Amazing Grace   This is working for me.  Happy, happy, joy joy.  Now I can write about my innermost feelings, etc.  Typically, I can't talk about what I really want to talk about with anybody because I have begun to censor myself with my therapist.  That's okay, though, we talk about more important things, I guess.  It's good that she doesn't think I am truly certifiable, just a little nutty.  Dating.  Hanging out.  Hooking up.  Seeing somebody. Getting together.  Um...the list goes on for this particularly interesting concept. Two people, independant, in their own bodies, at different points in life, on different paths, perhaps of different races, genders, economic classes, etc. meeting each other and eventually forming a special connection of a variety of strenghts and perhaps even coming together in some way--physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually...  Truly, I would have to say there are several definitions for this peculier concept of two people "finding each other"  ... again, the list goes on.  Many terms can qualify the special relationship that these people have and these relationships can look very different across cultures, etc. Sometimes, it just boggles my mind all of the different ways that people can come together in a way and they consider it to be one thing and to another, the relationship might mean/appear to be something totally different. Trust.  Love.  Friendship.  Honor.  Companionship.  Passion. Excitement.  Romance.  Sex.  Lust. Enamoration. Admiration. Sharing.  Longing.  Yearning.  Compassion.  Truth...  ...  ...  ...  Now, let's just do a little definition of what I would consider the ideal circumstance.  Okay, obviously, the ideal circumstance for me.  Two people meet somewhere and form an instant bond which turns into a friendship that seems to never have been  not  in existance.  These two people trust each other and have FUN together. They like to be with each other but don't have to always be with each other.  They share secrets and can understand facial expressions, body language, inuendos, implicit messages, mind-reading begins to happen (to an extent)...there is an inexplicable connection.  Love?  Friendship?  Whatever you care to call it.  There is a connection.  Who are these people?  It doesn't matter as long as they respect each other and trust each other with their very souls. Women, men, whatever.  Two people...three?  Who knows.    Love and sexuality do not have to go hand in hand but sometimes they do.  People find pleasure in the touch of another's hand, mouth, skin.  People find pleasure touching another's hand, skin, body.  Pleasure comes in many shapes, sizes, scents, sounds...  One day, probably when I was driving in my car, it just hit me... I want to grow old with somebody.  I want to KNOW somebody.  Is that somebody in my life right now?  I am going to have to say that I don't know.  There are some people who I have come to care about very deeply but I am beginning to lose some of those crucial elements of what I think makes an ideal partnering, relationship, whatver you call it.  There are some days when I just want to sit and cry because I wonder... What is to come of this friendship?  What is to come of these years spent together?    The answer, I am afraid, might be more painful than I would like; however, perhaps it is time to move on.  Time to grow.  Time to take a step outside of myself or a step inside of myself to see what I need.  What I want.  What I feel.

      Hmm...Is this working again?  It appears to be so.  That would absolutely ROCK if I can post again to this because I have missed it.  There isn't anything overly exciting going on in my life, really.  Nadia's wedding is getting closer and closer so that makes me happy.  I would say more but she might read this!  Ha ha.  Work is work.    I am sick.  Blah.  Um, that's that.

      Oh, and one more thing...I DO NOT HAVE ANY IDENTIFYING FEATURES THAT WOULD TELL ANYBODY WHO I AM!  Oh, the frustration.  For those of you who have no idea what I am talking about, I hope you do not lose respect for this fine cathartic ramble.  I hope that you remain an avid reader of this and other fine literature.  I hope that you move on and forget this even happened.    Unless of course, you're the one to whom I am directing this fit of nasty outrage.  Good day.

      Recently, I read a friend's blog and she said that I write too much about other people's lives.  Um, well, I am sorry.  So, I guess that I will take issue with that here.  Who reads this?  Perhaps mostly random people who probably don't even know the people I am talking about anyway.  I also rarely use identifying characteristics when referring to people because I value personal information and privacy and all that jazz.  If there are no random people reading this and it's only friends of mine... well, most of you know us and probably read the blogs that other people keep on themselves that I find a lot more offensive and personally revealing (not about me, necessarily, but about themselves) than anything I would ever write.  Yes, I am being immature and slightly out of character for my typically meek mannered self; however, certain things just irk me.    Anyway, that's all I have the time for, really.  Work beckons.

      [2/16/2003 9:47:44 PM | Jenna Logue] Today I went shopping and spent money on lots of things made of polyester. Beads, too. I bought necklaces and a bracelet, too. Yes, that required money spent. Oh well.   We saw Chicago, too. It was very good, excellent even. Inspiring. Catherine Zeta-Jones is hot. Renee Zellwiger is mildly obnoxious. Richard Gere singing was funny. Queen Latifah was her usual amusing self. The costumes were amazing and I loved the way they mixed the real with the imaginary. I think I will purchased it as soon as possible. The soundtrack, too.   I also bought travel books for Ireland. Of course, that is probably the final straw to break the camel of not going's back. Oh well. I wish I had thought to ask Rachel. Maybe it wil work out better if it's last minute. Hmmm. Whatever. It would be amazing if I get to go. Especially since it won't cost me much, if anything.   Right now we're watching The Music Man on ABC. It's okay. Melissa is reading her book about Europe that she bought today. It's sort of sad because she's all hopeful. We'll probably get blasted out of the universe before either of us get a chance to leave the country again. Even to go to Canada.   Yesterday I babysat. It was a lot of fun. The kids were good and neither of them cried, screamed, or got injured. It was a good time.   Of course, I didn't get anything done today or yesterday. This house is even more of a disaster than it was yesterday...or the day before. Melissa did the dishes yesterday. She'll be home all day tomorrow because she's one of the lucky ones who gets that NATIONAL HOLIDAY off from work. She'll sit on her ass on the computer and read about Europe all day, mark my words.   Maya got stuck in a plastic bag today. It was sad. I was afraid she was suffocated somewhere when I couldn't find her after she ran away after doing mad dashes around the house! Finally we found her behind the bar, hiding. She was stuck. It was sad. When I freed her, she ran upstairs and was puffed out. Max is a wuss because he was puffed out and hiding under my bed. He's so cute right now, curled up next to me. I love my cats. I wish I could sit home and do nothing all day long, watching movies with happy endings and playing with my cats.   I wish I was happier. Instead of doing anything about this, I sit and mope and cry and act like a moron. I am just a nut.   Matthew Broderick is weird looking...kind of like a perpetual little boy. There are a lot of men who look like perpetual little boys. Like they're playing dress up in somebody else's clothing, no matter what they're wearing. It's kind of weird.   Of course, at least he didn't gain 70 pounds since starting college. I have been out for two years so that's six years...seventy pounds. I am pathetic. Disgusting. Lazy. Fat. Pretty gross, actually. I bought clothing today, yes. It'll further enable me to not do laundry except for every 4-6 weeks. Yes, that. It will also enable me to feel at least somewhat comfortable when sqeezing my fatter than fat ass, stomach, arms, legs, boobs, neck, etc. into clothing. Hopefully I won't look overly disgusting.   Max is so sweet. He's black and cuddly. Maya is sleeping on Melissa who is on my couch using Renee's comforter that I was using when I was sick and now have to wash along with the laudry I still haven't done from the last TWO times that I did laundry. I wonder what I have that's so important if I haven't noticed that it's gone this long.   Oh. Well. It's almost 10 and I have to get up tomorrow morning. Just like everyother morning. Unfortunately for me, I am not one of the luckey ones. Oh well. It's just not fair. I mean, a week off to do NOTHING is nice.   What do I do with my money if I don't have any? I think I do spend it like it's water. Think I would have learned my lesson by now.   The phone cord keeps coming out of this stupid computer. We're too lazy to get a new one that isn't broken. Gonna sign off now, to mope around the house some more, of course.

We saw  Chicago , too.  It was very good, excellent even.  Inspiring.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is hot.  Renee Zellwiger is mildly obnoxious.  Richard Gere singing was funny.  Queen Latifah was her usual amusing self.  The costumes were amazing and I loved the way they mixed the real with the imaginary.  I think I will purchased it as soon as possible.  The soundtrack, too.  I also bought travel books for Ireland.  Of course, that is probably the final straw to break the camel of not going's back.  Oh well.  I wish I had thought to ask Rachel.  Maybe it wil work out better if it's last minute.  Hmmm.  Whatever.  It would be amazing if I get to go.  Especially since it won't cost me much, if anything.  Right now we're watching  The Music Man  on ABC.  It's okay. Melissa is reading her book about Europe that she bought today.  It's sort of sad because she's all hopeful.  We'll probably get blasted out of the universe before either of us get a chance to leave the country again.  Even to go to Canada.  Yesterday I babysat.  It was a lot of fun. The kids were good and neither of them cried, screamed, or got injured.  It was a good time.    Of course, I didn't get anything done today or yesterday.  This house is even more of a disaster than it was yesterday...or the day before.  Melissa did the dishes yesterday.  She'll be home all day tomorrow because she's one of the lucky ones who gets that NATIONAL HOLIDAY off from work.  She'll sit on her ass on the computer and read about Europe all day, mark my words.  Maya got stuck in a plastic bag today. It was sad. I was afraid she was suffocated somewhere when I couldn't find her after she ran away after doing mad dashes around the house!  Finally we found her behind the bar, hiding.  She was stuck. It was sad.  When I freed her, she ran upstairs and was puffed out.  Max is a wuss because he was puffed out and hiding under my bed.  He's so cute right now, curled up next to me.  I love my cats. I wish I could sit home and do nothing all day long, watching movies with happy endings and playing with my cats.  I wish I was happier.  Instead of doing anything about this, I sit and mope and cry and act like a moron.  I am just a nut.  Matthew Broderick is weird looking...kind of like a perpetual little boy.  There are a lot of men who look like perpetual little boys.  Like they're playing dress up in somebody else's clothing, no matter what they're wearing.  It's kind of weird.  Of course, at least he didn't gain 70 pounds since starting college.  I have been out for two years so that's six years...seventy pounds.  I am pathetic.  Disgusting. Lazy.  Fat.  Pretty gross, actually.  I bought clothing today, yes.  It'll further enable me to not do laundry except for every 4-6 weeks.  Yes, that.  It will also enable me to feel at least somewhat comfortable when sqeezing my fatter than fat ass, stomach, arms, legs, boobs, neck, etc. into clothing.  Hopefully I won't look overly disgusting.     Max is so sweet.  He's black and cuddly.  Maya is sleeping on Melissa who is on my couch using Renee's comforter that I was using when I was sick and now have to wash along with the laudry I still haven't done from the last TWO times that I did laundry.  I wonder what I have that's so important if I haven't noticed that it's gone this long.   Oh.  Well.  It's almost 10 and I have to get up tomorrow morning.  Just like everyother morning.  Unfortunately for me, I am not one of the luckey ones.  Oh well.  It's just not fair.  I mean, a week off to do NOTHING is nice.  What do I do with my money if I don't have any?  I think I do spend it like it's water.  Think I would have learned my lesson by now.  The phone cord keeps coming out of this stupid computer. We're too lazy to get a new one that isn't broken.   Gonna sign off now, to mope around the house some more, of course.

      It's only Wednesday and I feel like it should be Friday.  Tomorrow is going to drag just like today and yesterday dragged on and on.  Joy. Something to look forward to!  :-)   So, let's see, what's new?  I am waiting for things to come from half.com and that excites me.  I also ordered something from the HRC website.  One of them is a CD and for the life of me...oh, the bear.  Then I can tell Melissa that I have a gay bear, too!  She has this frilly bear from her mom and she named it Gaye bear but we mean it as gay bear.  Oh, we're mature in that house, let me tell you!  So, I have spent over $100 ordering stuff online over the past two weeks.  If you count back more, the number goes up.  Wow. I sure am a shop-a-holic!  That must be where my money goes--to online shipping fees!!!!!!!!!!!!  That and interest on my credit cards.  Shit, that reminds me, I need to pay my capital one bill like now.  Dammit.  So, back to work I should go.  It's only 4.  I might have a student coming in at 5pm but don't know why she'd be coming in and when I tried to call and ask her, she wasn't there. I guess I could e-mail her?  I know she's been sick, so perhaps she's still sick?  If she doesn't come, I have to go to a meeting for "15 minutes" with other students because my boss can't go.  Well, it's 4pm.  I have an hour or possible more left in this place.  I am hungry and want to go home, wave a magic wand, and have the house be clean and dinner be waiting on the stove.  I will probably drive through BK or something sickening like that on the way home.  Maybe I should get a pizza? Nah. I shouldn't spend any more money this week.  Whoa...it's not like I don't have it but I should learn to spend it less.

       Happy Monday   I just realized that I get Billy Joel and Bruce Springstein confused.  Yes, laugh at me.  I just did.   Only the Good Die Young  is on right now and we're listening to a Billy Joel CD.  Bruce Springstein was singing on TV last night and I asked Renee if he sang  Only the Good Die Young .  Silly me.  My aunt's sister is getting worse. She has Cancer.  Her body is apparently shutting down, my father just said in an e-mail.  She was taken to the hospital this weekend via ambulance.  I think this is the end.  What a sad thing.  Cleaning off my desk is about the only thing I can deal with today.  I just don't feel well.  Hopefully I am not getting sick again!  That would absolutely stink.  This weekend I surely slept enough and had a relaxing time.  Sure, I did laundry and dishes but that's not exactly strenuous activity!  If my body is wiped out due to those routine chores, I am in worse shape than I thought.  Guess it's time to start exercising!  Ew.  Spring can't come soon enough.  I love spring. It's my favorite season, weather-wise.  Each season has it's pros and cons but spring really doesn't have that many cons as compared to summer (heat/humidity) or winter (ice, cold, snow, dry air, cold, cold...)  Of course, the passing of time is a fascinating thing to consider, especially as one gets older.  The meaning of 5 minutes has changed drastically.  I remember once in VA (I was about 5 or 6) when my mom said she'd be coming back to bed in 5 minutes and it was FOREVER!  Imagine 5 minutes seeming like a long time.  Sheryl Crow was on the Grammy's last night and they said she won (what, I forget) in 1994.  Well, I nearly lost it when I realized that was almost 10 years ago and I remember it clearly.  When I start remembering things that happened like 20 years ago, that's when I am freaked out.  I remember choking on a hot dog when I was two.  That was 21 years ago, nearly 23.    Friday is payday.  Allelujah.  I am also going to submit my reimbursement sheets to get myself some serious money.  Hopefully they'll be in so I get them on Friday along with my paycheck.  If not, I will have another thing to look forward to next Friday.  We also have to pay the rent this weekend.  Oh, the joys.  Hmmm.  I am going to pay my loan rignt now before I forget.  Okay, that's my update.

      Well, this weekend I was in NY City.  I couldn't talk about that on here in case my friend who I was going to surprise at her wedding shower read this.  The shower was so much fun.  I truly enjoyed it and am glad that I got to go.  It was great to see some of the people I graduated with and haven't seen since, meet her family, his family, and some of their friends.  The wedding will be so much fun; I can't wait.  Today I have decided that I don't want to do anything productive at all. I want to go buy an RV and travel around the country and Canada, living like a true traveling woman.  The cats will learn to like the RV and as long as I have enough good music to throw in the CD player, I will be excited.  Who needs people?  Honestly. That is how I feel today.  Sitting here at work realizing how much of myself I am giving to my job is depressing.  At the same time, that is what live is for the majority of our society.  If you want to live the American Dream, you give yourself to your job.  You need to deserve what you earn.  God Bless America.  By the time I get home, you know, the place where I could feasibly have time to myself (who's that?) to do whatever it is that I like doing (what do I like to do, anyway?) in a comfortable, organized place that is surrounding me with good feelings and happiness.  Um...  The only good thing about my house lately is my cats.  I can't get into my bedroom without stepping over random piles of crap.  I can't find the time to clean it up (or to do the dishes, for that matter).  Weekends? You ask.  What about the weekends?    Let me tell you about the weekends.  This past weekend was a wonderful weekend that I spent in NY City.  That is the only true, real, relaxing, fun weekend that I have had in a very long time.  I spend them working or well, working.  This weekend and next I will be driving with vans full of students to and from North Carolina for a spring break trip.  Oh, yes. Excitement exudes from my being.  Not.  Relaxation?  Forget it.  I am the type that won't be able to just let them go with the flow because I know that they won't be able to.  I am going to play up the adult thing, I think, because I just need time to myself. I have a ton of work to do and I need to relax.  Of course, I will feel mildly out of place working in the church all day so I don't know what I am going to do.  My boss thinks that I should cement the relationships with the townspeople so we can continue going to this particular set of cities to work during our spring breaks.  Well, that's all well and good but, well, I don't wanna.  Sure, marketing, networking, people skills are great skills to have but when push comes to shove, I have them, dammit.    I am just worn out. Worn down.  It's nothing I can avoid or control, it seems. I am a robot.  I am a zombie going through life like it is just happening to me.  The things I really want to do are considered pointless or immature, or irresponsible...that's the one I like the best. Irresponsible.  Why should it be considered irresponsible to do what you want in life? Who are you accountable to?  Why shouldn't I do what I want to do?  Why is society set up to make the majority of people unhappy?  Seriously, it is.  I am trying to get myself motivated to change that.  I am. Lesbian activists are fascinating.  Peace activists.  I just wish I had the GUTS.  Where does one acquire guts?  I haven't seen any "Need guts?" classes.  Ho hum.  Well, there are too many things to do today so I think I will start writing a book.

      I am in North Carolina, safely.  We're working in a school with different age groups. My preferred group is, of course, the kindergarten class.  Today, though, I am going to a preschool class to play. I am learning by exposure to different things.  I want to talk to the literacy specialist but don't know if she's approachable.  Ha!   I am going to be home for a few weeks before leaving for the much anticipated wedding in NYC.  Then, apparently, my aunt is truly planning on sending me to Ireland with my cousin. I will believe that when I am on the plane, no, when I am on the ground in Ireland. Guess I ought to get my passport soon, eh? I miss the kitties at home.  Roommates, too, yes. I just miss the kitties. We're going to Cirque de Soleil on Friday. Very unexpected. Pretty good show, I am thinking, so it will be worth it. The trip budget, no, the Jenna's pocket budget, is paying for $5 of each ticket plus my own. They won't know it's my own pocket money, though, and that's okay with me. I just kind of wish I weren't the grown up on the trip so I could go without guilt that two of the students refuse to go. I do think, though, that they'd be the types to have to be muzzled during the show and then complain. We're leaving early the next morning. Fun fun. Well, the other thing that gets to me this week will remain untyped until I get home.

      War.  I just can't understand why.    Spring has spring and the rain is falling.  If April flowers bring May flowers...what to March showers bring?  April snow?  Probably.  Gotta buy a dress for the wedding.  I thought I had enough in my closet to make something pretty to wear but I have decided that I need a nice new springy wedding appropriate dress.  And new shoes.    All the fat lady stockings at Walmart are on sale, assuming that they're being phased out, and it's the brand/size that I KNOW fits me well and they last through more than one wearing and more than one washing--in the machine.  Oh well. Perhaps the other Walmart I live 7 miles from will have them.  Yes, you know I must live in a field because there are TWO Walmarts within 7.8 miles of my house.  Oh, yeah, at least until June.  My roommates both announced in different conversations on Monday night (Happy St. Patty's Day!) that they're moving in June. Not together, ha, that would be funny.  So, I either have to move a year or two sooner than I ever thought I would or find three (or two) roommates to move in with me and the cats.  Wish me luck.

      It's the end of the day now.  I am going to leave my office and embark on a journey home.  When I arrive at my home, I will be greeted by three feline friends and a terrible mess.  Cleaning that terrible mess, doing laundry, and cooking for my loyal roommates should be on today's "to do" list; however, sitting in front of the TV and eating cookies is probably what will happen.  Reading isn't even fun for me.  I started to read  The Hours  last night so I can see the movie and feel educated about it.  Well, I read the first few chapters and then the last few.  That will suffice. I can't bother with the middle.  Of course, there is a hint of lesbianism and perhaps some blatant lesbianism so I might just keep reading.  If only for a few moments of peaceful solitude.    Spending life alone doesn't bother me much anymore.  I know that we might not even have long left in this world so I shouldn't be concerned about how I am going to live my life, just that I will.  Living each day like it is my last sure isn't fun.  I feel tied down, suffocated, overwhelmed by my job and my comittments.  I feel lonely and disconnected from the people who matter the most.  I feel as though my existence is shallow and pointless.  Nothing matters.  Well, I have a few more minutes here, should stay late but what would that do?  I wouldn't get anything else accomplished, I would just sit and stare at random Internet pages.  Nothing bad, just random stuff that may or may not be work related...  I guess I can pay bills or go out to dinner by myself or go to Walmart and buy things I don't need or go home and mope.    Oh well.  Another day over and another will begin in a few hours.

      Spring has sprung.  And with it war.  With that, depression.  Uncertainty.  Today I am at work and I plan to be here all week.  Of course, it is very difficult to do anything when all I can think about is how uncertain life is.  What if this is the end of the world?  What would that mean, anyway?  Would we all just blow up and poof be gone?  Would we have immeasurable pain, agony, and suffering first?  What would happen?  Would the world be taken over by "madmen" who want nothing more than to torture Americans, no matter what their political beliefs, etc. might be?  No matter how innocent?  No matter how far from Bush's thinking they are?  Will I see my family again if I don't go home anytime soon?  Will we have to hide, terrified, in the basement while who-knows-what is happening to our country?  Will I be taken captive one day when I am driving to or from work?  Will there be a microwave bomb that takes away all of the connections to news media?  What is possible?  How much of this is just created by somebody who wants to keep Americans submissive...just in case? Is it somebody's sick joke?  Cruel playtime?  What does this all mean?    Right now I am waiting to sit in on a program call with my colleagues across the nation.  I doubt I will have anything to contribute, rarely do.  Oh well.   Oh, here they are.  Excitement.  I just shared a tid bit about our spring break experience.  Hey, when I have anything that is positive, I share it with the group!  They're all high on themselves so why shouldn't I be high on myself and my site?

      Back at work, I am.  It's a nice warm St. Patrick's Day and I found something green (and longsleeved, of course) to wear.    I cut my own hair on Sunday morning. It's about 8 inches or more shorter, more in the front because I layered it around my face.  I also gave myself bangs for the first time since I was about 9 years old.  Wow.  I figured, I can't lose weight over night so in order to make a change to my appearance, the hair's the way to go.  I also spent so much time in the sun during my week in NC that it got lighter (my hair).  Yay me.  Currently wondering who I will find to impress.  Nobody seems interested.  Guess I need to get out more.  Where, though?  Hate the idea of going to war.  Sucks.  Went to a peace vigil last night. Plan to go to more and plan to protest the war.  I am also e-mailing/faxing/calling Congress so it's not like I am just protesting without trying to actually talk to people/make them know their constituents are opposed to war.  Um, that's about all the time for updates.  I spent over 200 getting minor tune ups made to my car. They replaced all friggin' three wiper blads when I only asked them to do one! Bastards.

      So, I just checked the weather channel.  It's going to be back down into the below freezing range on Sunday and not pop back up into the spring temperatures until later in the week, as in next week.  At least we'll have good weather until Sunday.  It had better not snow for the wedding. I remember Easters that we've had snow.  One sticks out in my mind in particular...walking into church in the new sandals I was so excited to wear...freezing my feet off because the parkinglot was covered in snow and more snow and more snow...ah, the joys.  Okay, that's all. Time to play games and then try and sleep.    zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  That's me, trying to sleep.  Okay, one more time...  zzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

       Yes, we have no bananas.  And  It's 3 o'clock in the morning.   So, I can't sleep for many reasons.  One of which is, I have indegestion/acid reflux and it's killing me.  Another of which could be the worry over the site visit tomorrow.  One of my programs is being scrutinized again to make sure I am compliant with the grant's stipulations and all that crap.  Honestly, I think I am running a wonderful program and the majority of my students would agree as would just about all of the other people you would ask/who would be concerned.  Of course, the woman coming to do the visit is rather "by the book" which is all well and good but I don't feel like I have a "book" to go by.  I don't have the exact specifications of our state's grant and every single time I ask her for them, she doesn't send them. So, in my mind, if she says one thing about my files or anything specifically grant related and not programmatic, I can just play the game right back at her.  I personally shouldn't be sitting up at three in the freakin' morning worrying about this woman's visit.  If she decides to recommend taking the grant away, I have no reason to be personally offended.  Plus, if she makes the motion to take our grant away, there are about ten thousand other people to go through before anything is actually done about it.  So, I would be able to find another job and bail on them.  NOT like any of this is even a possibility but I always jump to the most extreme case scenario and believe it until ulcers form in the pit of my stomach and wherever else ulcers can form.  I am convinced that my entire stomach is eaten away by ulcers and I function at some miraculous biological state of stomach-less-ness.   I am typing in the dark and I must say how impressed with myself I am that I can type numbers and symbols without having to look at the keyboard. I just never realized that I have become so adept at typing.  It's probably because I spend the majority of my days in front of a computer typing e-mails or random crap...I mean, stuff for my job.  So, whatever, I am annoyed with myself for getting so worked up and causing physical ailments to result from my work-related stressors.  I just wish I wasn't so sensitive. It's just that I have never been good at failure or criticisim (or spelling, for that matter) and this job is bringing all of those feelings to the forefront of my being/existence.  I have a really supportive network of people on campus who would still let me work and would trust my work if we were to lose the grant. I am not really worried about losing the grant, I am just convinced it's going to happen when I know full well that I can't make myself sick over something that isn't going to happen and if it did would not happen for another year and the program would still run...besides...I am only the assistant director, my supervisor would also be responsible because that's his job.  Ah, hierarchy.  Well, let's see. What else is worth typing about?  I got the dress I am going to wear for the wedding. It's two pieces but will look like one because I have a blazer or sweater to wear over it.  I also got shoes and stockings to match.  The dress is a light pink with off-white flowers on it...they're small understated flowers outlined in black.  Then, I got a blazer to match and an off-white, short-sleeved sweater to wear.  The top is sleeveless.  I also got off-white/pearly shoes. They're closed toe and have a sling back with a buckle fastener.  I think the outfit screams "wear pearls with me!!!" so I think I will wear the necklace and earrings that my uncle gave me after my aunt died. They were hers.  Were it later in the summer or an outside function, I would find the perfect hat to go along with the outfit. It does scream "wear a hat wit me" but only if I wore the sweater...no, perhaps the blazer, too.  I am wearing it for Easter so my family can see it on me.  I have to get the pictures developped soon after returning from the wedding and then show them to people.  I am SO BAD with pictures.  Shoot. Speaking of pictures, I forgot to bring the film from work to get sent out so the students stop nagging me about the film. Dammit.  Oh well. Another six years won't kill them.  No, it's just been um....well, two weeks now.  Oops.  Well, I posted the plea for roommates at human resources and with some trusted colleagues at work.  So far, two names have come up.  If either or both of them turn into reality, I potentially have it made before either of my roommates bail.  Excuse me, move out.  I would comment more but will refrain in lieu of upsetting anybody or saying things I don't really mean.  I am good at that, or so I have been told.  I just checked my e-mail and have one from a student who is all pissy about this other student in the group.  Won't go into it in public forum but it's just one of those situations that makes me cranky.  I am under stress to drop her from the program but can't just do that because of the grant's stipulations.  At least I think that's how it works because I only have the general guidelines and not the state specific guidelines/requirements/procedures.  I also trust this student and think she means well and want to give her the chance.  I am ultimately in charge and what I say goes so ... suck it up girls.  Well, I am running out of things to say that don't start the paragraph with "well."  Suppose I were to ramble on all night and then take a shower and go to work?  Wouldn't that make for a fun day in the office?  My poor students/colleagues.  Oh well. Such is life.  No, I will just play games until my eyes fall out of my head and then I will sleep too late and Renee will have to kick my ass to get me up in the morning. Good thing I have them as roommates. What the hell am I going to do when they bail?  I mean move.    One more thing...oh, now I forget what it is.  Must not have been important.

      Well, it's Tuesday.  Feels like Monday to me only it's not.  Yippee!  This weekend I saw  Footloose  at one high school and  Honk!  at another. Both shows were good in their own way.   Footloose  had really good dancers and a more engaging story;  Honk!  had great voices and a perplexing character/portrayal of the cat. Both were worth sitting through.  I also watched the Academy Awards on Sunday night.  I must say how happy I am that Michael Moore won for Bowling for Columbine.  He makes people think and I like that.  He's really in your face, as demonstrated by his tirade on stage during his acceptance speech.  Also, I must admit that I was rather shocked by Eminem's song winning.  Who'd have thunk it?  Eminem at the Academy Awards--he wasn't there, some hippy/rapper/gangsta dude accepted the Oscar.  Weird.  Well, back to work. More later.  Oh, I got the dress for the wedding.  It's pink.  More later.

      Why can't I think?  Why can't I focus?  Why can't I just sit and be productive and do what I need to do without feeling pulled in ten million different directions?  Why can't I just be normal? Why can't I focus?  Why can't I just sit in front of the TV or read or play computer games all day for just ONE day of my life?  Why can't I just win the lottery or find a billionaire to marry me so I can be a "kept woman?"  Why do I like what I do one day and hate it the next?  Why can't I just focus my mind on one task and not think about ten million things that I would rather be doing?  Why can't I sit still without my mind wandering?  Why do I have no organizational skills?  Why am I a slacker in the eyes of so many?  Why am I always hungry?  Why can't I buy a house?  Why am I afraid to get my PhD?  Why don't I have somebody to spend my life with?  Why does nobody show me affection?  Why can't I just admit that I can't do this job alone and not feel like I need an assistant that I know I can't have?  Why doesn't my student staff come to work?  Why didn't I go to work when I was a student?  Why can't I just stay focused?  Why can't I just go out to lunch and let somebody else do my job for the rest of the day?  Why can't my boss stay home all day without feeling like he has to come in?  Why can't people have babies without husbands?  Why can't I have a baby now?  Why do I want a baby?  When will I find myself?  How many times a day do I need to sit and stare into space before I will see something different?  What am I looking for when I stare into space?  How often do I need to find something else to worry about when I already have ten thousand things floating through my head?  When will I have my priorities in order?  What are my priorities?  How long do I have to get them in order?  When do I know what my purpose is?  Who will hold me and tell me it will all be okay?  Who will walk beside me and hold my hand while I wade through the wate--neck deepr? Will I drown?  What will happen to me if I quit my job and travel around the country?  Why does money mean so much to so many people?  How can I stop worrying about and focusing on money?  Why can't I just stand up for myself?  Why can't I sit here and do my work without drifting off into never never land?  Why can't I just clean my room when I get home?  Where is my motivation?  Why have I lost my motivation?  Why am I sitting here when I should be doing thousands of things?  What should I do if I am not doing this?  Why shouldn't I be doing this?  Who says I can't?  Who says what I should and shouldn't and can and can't do?  Why should I listen?  Why shouldn't I listen? Do I listen? Does anybody other than me tell me what I should and shouldn't and can and can't do?  If nobody else tells me, should somebody else tell me? Why can't I just tell myself?  Should I be the only one telling myself?  What time will I know when I will become a billionaire?  Why can't I just win the lottery?  Why don't I keep in touch with more of my friends?  Why do I just sit home and do nothing instead of hang out with fun people?  Why does everybody have somebody but me?  Why can't I get married this weekend?  Why can't I take three years off from a responsible life and travel the world?  Who says that's irresponsible?  Why does money matter so much?  What will happen to my cats while I am in Ireland?  Will somebody watch them?  When I am in Ireland, will we be okay?  Will I really get to Ireland?  Why can't I just move away?  Okay, time to go to lunch.

      It's almost April and it's snowing.  Oh, yeah, I live in upstate NY... it's supposed to do random crap like this.  Ha!  Silly me.   The weather for the wedding is supposed to be a bit better, anyway.  It'll be sunny and 55 as of right now (on Saturday) but I anticipate many changes between now and then.  Of course, I have an outfit that has the potential to be layered or not, depending on the weather conditions.  My shoes are also appropriate for rain, snow, or anything, really.   Well, they're open on the sides but, well, my feet don't mind.  Of course, it's not my wedding so I should not obsess about it so much.  The bride has a blog and I love reading her updates.  It's such an exciting process!  Someday, perhaps I will have a party that is all about me...or something like that.  I want to get dressed up...like a wedding for me or something for me.  It sounds like so much fun.  Shoot, time to go.  More tomorrow or later from home.

      This weekend was my friend's wedding.  We all stayed in a hotel and got dressed up pretty and went to the church and cried and then to the reception and had fun.  Yay wedding.  She looked beautiful.  Her family was happy.  He was happy.  Our friends got to have a mini-reunion.  I can't wait to see the pictures.  Perhaps I will develop the film soon.  Imagine that.  We brought home one of the table center pieces.  I am going to paint the glass bowl that it was in.  They'll be moving soon.  All the new stuff from the shower and wedding should help out quite a bit.  That's nice for them.  They deserve it.  When we got home after the lovely drive with 5 people in my car our house had no electricity.  There had been a lovely ice storm and knocked out all the power everywhere around.  Ours was out from Friday until Monday night at 9p.m.  We only had to deal with it for 24 hours.  The poor cats, though, probably didn't like it much in silence when they were alone.  Cruel owners that we are.  Tonight we get to throw away all of our food.  Should be oh-so-fun.   The campus was without power on Friday and Saturday nights.  The students couldn't stay in their dorms so they all had to sleep in the library or the gym.  Ha! What an adventure. I would have liked that at one time but now, things like that piss me off.  I have become an old lady, stuck in my ways and not happy about unusual circumstances.  I spent more money today.  I ordered a ring from a gay website.  LIKE I need a $50 silver ring that says equality in Latin inside the band.  I crack myself up.  Perhaps I was thinking that if I wear it, I will be noticed by others who know what it "means."  I am pathetic.  How pathetic, I will spare you, fair reader.  Speaking of reading...okay, never mind.  Gotta go.

      I am leaving to go home for Easter. I haven't seen my family in I don't remember HOW long and it's kind of depressing!  I don't think I have been home since February for Grandma's birthday.   Bringing laundry with me is a hopeful act. I don't know but I think I will be able to get it done if I start it tonight.  Tough. I am leaving. I can't sit here any more.  I don't care if it's an hour and a half early.  I will leave at 4 but what's 25 more minutes?  Enjoy the weekend.

      I need to find things.  I need to find a lot of things.  That would require organization.  That would require time and energy.  Those would require sleep and healthy eating habits.    I have no money. I will say that I am not saying that as an exaggeration.  I just got a reimbursement check today from my programs and promptly lost it and now can't put it in the bank.  I am also waiting for my damn tax refund checks, which total nearly or just over $400!  Those would come in handy right about now.  My paycheck on the 9th is spent on the new house.  Money.    Of course, I have to stop spending money and I have to stop wanting to always spend money.  My plans for this weekend involve money.  I think I am going to have to call my friend and cancel due to significant lack of funds.  How sick is this? I am making money at my job but I can't save for the life of me.  Isn't that just sick?  I mean, I am an adult who should have the brains and means to save my money.  I understand how important it is.  I know what it's like to not have money.  I know what it's like to owe money.  I know what it's like to well, not know how I am going to make ends meet.  This shouldn't happen!  It's sick.  Were I motivated, I would sit today and organize my desk so I can be productive in the next few weeks.  Of course, then there's Ireland.  HOW the hell am I going to afford that?  I don't know what I am going to do.  They've ordered the plane ticket but I don't have my passport and I don't have any savings.  Hell, there's more in my savings acct. than in my checking acct. right now and I nearly fainted when I heard that on the phone today when I called...

      It's Wednesday and almost May.  Guess what May 16th brings?  Another move.  Yes, another move.  Oh the excitement never ends in my life.  This will be the third move after college. One year in an apartment and now this year in the house with the girls and now a town house with one of the girls.  Perhaps this, the third time, will be a charm, as the saying goes.  Look, I can only hope!  It's a nice place and they take cats (2, Yuki will go "live with Renee's parents" cough, cough, wink, wink).  There is a dishwasher.    I am going to Ireland for two weeks at the end of June/beginning of July.  At the beginning of August, I am going to Seattle, I think, for a Phi Beta Kappa conference. I am excited about that.  All expenses paid. Hell yeah.    Well, that's the extent of the excitement in my life.  There's a Phi Beta Kappa dinner tonight and I got dressed up for the occasion.  It isn't even a free meal, either.  $16 bucks a person!

      A lot has changed since I last blogged.  First of all, I am no longer so worried about money.  I need to just calm down!  Everything will work out.  Oh, and I also discovered that my tax refund checks had actually been deposited on April 4th and I never noticed. Oops!    I need to consider what is important in life--health and happiness.  As long as I am healthy and happy, that is all I need.  People I care about are, for the most part, healthy and happy, too.  That's what matters.    We're signing our lease today! I am very excited and want to move in right now!  Of course, we're gradually bringing things over this weekend and the course of the week.  On the following Saturday, the U-Haul comes and over goes our furniture!  The only thing that I wish we could do is paint.  That's okay, at least the walls are clean and interesting--they have a textured treatment which is kind of neat. We can hang anything we want to on the walls as long as it isn't wallpaper or border that sticks.  I will most definitely have my Renoir in the living room.    This new place is going to be so much fun!  Renee's family is bringing us some of their extra plants/bulbs/seeds to plant in our garden.  I am going to do something in the back by the patio and then garden out in the front, too.  I want to plant along the walkway and near the door.  It will be beautiful!    I saw Melissa's new apartment the other night. It's really cute!  She will be happy there, I think.  She is taking my old couch, even though I will REALLY miss it.  I never thought I could become attached to a couch.  She's also taking my old TV stand from my bedroom at home.  Nobody used it this year and I used it in my apartment but not since.  She's buying a new TV.  I bought her old one when she moved to Chicago and will just keep that instead of selling it back to her; she wants a 27 inch, flat screen TV...and a DVD player!  Renee had a DVD player and I have a VCR (so does she) so we're set.  We will also have her TV upstairs with the Nintendo and one of the VCRs hooked up.  Today, when we go to sign the lease, we'll choose bedrooms.  Work is work.  I am organizing, somewhat.  I am leaving today at noon to get my hair highlighted.  I wanted to wait until closer to my departure date but, well, my roots are pretty bad.  Since I have never had roots, I kind of find them icky on myself--as I do on others.  I am going to tell her to make it so I won't have to re-do it as the new hair begins to grow in.    Well, back to work.  Just needed to blog.

      Wow.  Time flies.  It's June already.  Imagine that.  Let's see.  We're moved and relatively settled into the new town house. The cats are okay and seem to have adjusted nicely.  None of my clothing is put away in closets or drawers; I am still living out of suitcases and plastic bins.  Ireland is exciting.  I just cannot wait to see all of the new places and try new foods and meet new people.  I am looking forward to a very exciting experience. One thing that I need to do is get myself a camera.  That will be a huge expense if I do it right but will be well worth it.    Well, nothing much new to report in my own life.  I am going out to see a play tonight at The Hangar Theatre in Ithaca.  Fun times.  The subscription was my Christmas present from mr. boss-man and family.  :-)

      Funding.  No funding.  My salary is at risk of being cut.  Oh yes.  We are happy campers this morning.  I was running late as it was because nobody was home to force me to get up.  Yes, I admit it, I can't get up without a kick in the ass!  So, I took a shower, dried my hair, got dressed, fed the cats, put down extra food and water, packed to go home this weekend...and then left for work. REALLY late.  I got here, buckled my shoes, and came in to read an e-mail that said our program's grant wasn't funded by the government agency that funds it and so we're basically in a state of not knowing what this means.  At my own institution, the program funding from the grant increased my salary.  So, being selfish, if they can't maintain my salary at what it is, I don't know how loyal I will feel.  Graduate school...  Oh this day.  This day.  It's appropriate that it's Friday the 13th.  Oh how appropriate.

      The end of the week draws near and I am excited more and more about my upcoming trip to Ireland!  Though I have about a week and a half until I go, it is still the most exciting thing to look forward to in my life--and how exciting it is!    This weekend I will be home for Father's Day and then back at work Monday through Thursday.  I have a doctor's appointment on Friday and then on Friday evening we're going to a play--musical really.  I have to find those tickets...yes, I have lost something else.  Imagine that.  I just got back from lunch with Melissa.  She is okay. Renee was there with her colleagues, too.  It's the last day for their boss.  Celebration of sorts.  Two hours left to work. I guess Rachel isn't calling me today to do something later on after work. That's okay, I have to get things done at home anyway.  The cats will miss me enough tomorrow and Saturday during the day.  Good thing Renee is coming home on Saturday evening.  I won't worry so much about the babies.  They're so good.  Sweet animals.  I wish I could rescue them all.  Tonight I will empty the dishwasher and load it again with the newly dirty dishes, though there are not many.  I will also do some laundry and hope it dries okay in this humidity.  Then, I will organize some of my things.  Perhaps put clothing away in drawers/closets finally.  That and books.  For all of the excitement I had about settling in, I sure have managed to let it take forever!  Work is draining so the last thing I want to do at the end of a busy day is break a sweat.  Call me lazy.  Lazy.  The sky is gross.  If it just would RAIN and get it over with I would appreciate it.  Of course, the massive thunder storms are going to scare me to death tonight at home all alone.  I wish I had someone (human) to cuddle up with.  Not that if Renee were home she'd cuddle with me or anything.  Quite the contrary.    Someday my prince(ss) will come.  Maybe not today.  Maybe not tomorrow.  But soon.    Or something like that.  I got my dad Hillary Clinton's new book for Father's Day.  It's more of a Mom appropriate gift but I figured it was something he'd probably read and then she can read it and then they'll have it to add to their bookshelves.  I got myself one, too.  NOT that I should have spent $30 at BJ's last night.  I also got myself a book of short stories by Irish women authors.  So far, they're all really cheesy.  Romantic (heterosexual) bullshit.  Oh, and one really creepy one that was mildly disturbing...and perhaps romantic but more creepy than anything.  Perhaps I can pay my bills.  I have car insurance due by the 16th so that might be the first priority.  Then, credit card(s) and then...well, I have to leave a check for Renee to pay the utilities and rent while I am gone.  I will leave it blank and made out to her.  I wish the electric bill would come.  I will leave a check made out to NYSEG and then she can fill it in and mail it accordingly.  Then, when I get back, everything will be paid and I will be broke!    Not literally, of course.  cough  cough   The garden is just about complete. I forgot to send the rest of the cedar shavings home with Renee to give back to her parents.  That's okay.  I will use them since they're there.  I have to put some around the little circular garden at the base of the satellite dish.  Then, I will build up the others out front and the one on the side.  I will ask my dad if I can put cedar in a veggie garden.  He'll know.  Hum.  Being at home alone tonight is going to have the potential to creep me out a lot.  I will try and be brave but well, I am a wuss by nature.  I just think I have to give myself over to the wussy side; I must have been born that way.  Oh crap. I didn't bring anything with my car insurance policy number on it so I have to just pay that bill tomorrow. It will post in time.  If not, I have a grace period.  My loans and credit card aren't due until July 2nd but, well, perhaps I might just pay those now and get it over with.    Okay, that's all the witty fun for today.  My mind is tired and so are my eyes.

      I blame George Bush himself.  I hold him personally accountable for my potential loss of salary/cut to part-time.  Although the decision is not yet 100% final--as in we're still fighting it as an organization and have faith that something will pull through--I am keeping myself in check by realizing what can happen should we definitely lose our funding.  It's all good, though.  I will just have to get through.  Day by day. Step by step...etc.  Tonight I might go to a t-ball game.  I am not sure, though.  The weather is nice and Renee won't be home until late.  I am going to go out now and buy a camera and a watch at WalMart.  Fun times, spending money!

      I just got back from Ireland. It was wonderful. Honestly, I didn't want to come back except I missed my family and cats.  Perhaps I missed my friends, too.    A lot is just making me sort of depressed and well, I don't know what to do about it.  I need to grow but I am limiting myself.  It's true and others see it but, well, I just can't grow because I feel connected to what I know. Branching out is appealing but I am lazy.  AH well.  Anyway, Ireland.... I will post later. Just wanted to say I am back, a year older, and doing laundry.

      I didn't clean the house last night.  I did, however, sleep a lot and read some of my belated birthday cards and a letter that came in the mail from my grandmother.  I responded to hers and wrote a thank you letter to my parents but know that neither will be mailed for six zillion years.  Tonight, though, I need to at least deal with dishes.  A friend is coming to spend the weekend with me (part of the weekend) and so I don't want the house to be a complete disaster.  That and it would be nice to have people over soon.  It's quite a disaster and nothing is organized at all.  At least when I came back from the wedding/my birthday party weekend I put books on the shelves in the front room.  Soon, that will be decent.  I want to decorate and get things really nice for when my roommate comes back from her friend's wedding/vacation week at home.    Let's see...what else?  I don't know.  There is a lot going on at work but I get to take a lunch break and will leave at 4 p.m. anyway as summer hours are 9-4!  Then, I have some time to REALLY clean tonight. I can't sit in front of the TV for 6 hours; it is just not healthy.   The weather smells good. Um, that was a sentence.  No, the weather is nice today is part of what I meant to say--i.e. it feels good. Then, I was also thinking of the stench from the stupid construction vehicles that are constantly outside of my basement window so of course their fumes pour in.  So, it smells bad.  Hence "The weather smells good."  Wow.  Special.  I wish this had spell check! I have to remember to use spell check on Excel documents so I don't look like a fool. I realized that today when I was filling out a grid.  Okay, finish up a project and then go to lunch.  Free hamburger for my birthday!  Not that it's still my birthday but it's my birthday month!  :-)

      Well, back to work...  I have had a great few days here, really, because I am busy doing projects. I enjoy having all of the learning experiences that I have had these past few months and truly, I enjoy my job.  That makes me one of the lucky ones, I think, especially among my group of friends.  Ireland was fabulous and I want to go back--forever!  There is such beauty. For the most part, everybody we met was kind and honest.  The cities were not as "city like" as our US cities. Dublin was crowded but had great navigability (if that's a word) and wasn't too, too expensive.  My favorite part was the west coast and random ruins on the side of the road or in the middle of somebody's field.  Having such a past makes me nostalgic. I know the US has had an interesting past but I think Ireland just takes the cake.  It was untouched by Romans so maintained its own religion and language, etc. for longer than many other European nations.  It had its own trouble with England and their empire once that came to be but managed to escape relatively unscathed. True, Cromwell burned down and destroyed several castles and abbeys.  True, before that the Vikings had found their way into the country.  Overall, however, there are just some places with magnificent history.  My goal tonight is to truly clean my house. For real.  Last night I sat in front of the TV, moving only to get food and go to the bathroom, from 4:45 until midnight. Actually, 11:50 when the stupid rain made the damn satellite dish lose reception. I hadn't experienced that until last week and then last night. Of course, it made me desire cable in all its dish-free glory.  I was watching a lovely show called  A Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  on BRAVO. There were two in a row. It is a new show and I had been dying to see it as when the ad came on, I thought it was a spoof.  No, it's a real show. BRAVO is also having some gay reality dating show start at the end of the month. Only, some of the guys are straight and the bachelor/looker doesn't know. That's bizarre but yet, I find myself getting hooked at the thought of it!  Oh, time for lunch.  Fun times.

      I am going to Allegany this weekend. I wish I could stay longer.  I need to lose 70 lbs.  No, not want to; no, not for vanity.  For my life.  We won't talk about that.  Well, it's the weekend.

      Guess what I finally did?  Cleaned up the downstairs!  True, I haven't washed the kitchen floor or organized the front closet... BUT the place looks lived in not "being moved into."  I haven't quite decorated but I did put some little things around to make it look less sparse.    My goal is to get the car cleaned out before I leave for the weekend.  I had planned to wash and wax it and I still might do that, just not tonight as I have to go to a musical.  THAT is one of the reasons I have the downstairs done; the girl I am going to the show with is meeting me at my house first.  Can't have people see it the way it was, can I?  Blah!!  The cats are a riot lately, they're just so confused about where the other cat is...Maya was meowing and meowing at the storage room door last night. I don't think it was leaking again; I think she truly thought Yuki was in there or something.  Max is just clueless as always.  As I post here, I think of the movie  The Net  and am slightly nervous to have my information all over the web for the world to see.  Well, at least I have copies of who I am and people know me. She was slightly removed from civilization and she didn't think to keep her important documents on her person, not in her purse which she flounced around.  Besides, I don't have any knowledge of illicit activities...  Well, back to work. One workshop redesigned and two to go!

      Hi. I had fun in Allegany this weekend. We played Rummy with my mom who is, if you know her, not a fan of cards but it was her idea so when she said "let's play cards" my dad and I (who love to play cards and are very competitive when playing games) flew a the chance. It was good natured fun and I loved it.  It makes me want to move home and live with my grandmother after all.  Yeah, I just said that.  Do I mean it?  Probably.  Probably not.  It depends on my mood.  Last night I did it. I ordered something from a late night infomercial.  Yes, that's right, I ordered something from a late night infomercial.  I called within the 10 minute special to have one of my payments cut off! Oh boy. Do you sense the excitement?  I have plans every single night this week.  None are really with the person I wish they were with, though.  No offense to any of you who might read this and be one of those people.  Not that anybody reads this anymore.  It's okay, though. It's cathartic and that's the point.   Hi world.  This is my dirty laundry.  I am airing it now.

      Well, it's been a week.  Let's see...nothing has really happened.  It's been hot and humid. Right now it's pouring and there are flood warnings.  I am at work, closing up shop.  It's been busy.  That's pretty much it.  Busy.  Tomorrow I am leaving at 5 am to drive out to the airport to fly away to Seattle at 7am.  I will be there for a Phi Beta Kappa conference.  The convention of smart folks.  Scary stuff.  I have a new outfit.  Because they'll care/notice.    It'll be cool to have time by myself in a nice hotel.  I might just find myself a "handsome man" like my grandmother said I should. She's been so good about it, too.  Oh well. I thought I had it too lucky without anybody mentioning men ever again. It was bound to happen.     Well, I guess there's nothing new or exciting to report. My own life is dull, really.  I am going to leave here and go home to clean my room and pack.  I will probably end up sitting in front of the TV instead.  I should have done ten thousand things here at work but didn't so now will leave the office messy...

      Seattle is a beautiful city.  Expensive hotels are pretentious, though.    I am at work right now, after hours, though.  I am organizing my desk and recycling random crap.  I am also trying to just focus. I don't want my students to come back to this disaster and it's  only  my job to keep my  own  things organized and I am not the adminstrative assistant in the office so I am  not  responsible for other people's shit. They don't say I am but it's so messy that it's  impossible  to work.  Whoa.  Anyway, that's how I feel about that.  I am also sick of relationships.  My own and other people's.  I wish it was as easy to live in the version of reality I have created in my head as it was to live in denial.  I have such a great picture of what I want to be and do...I just can't lose sight of it.  I have to focus on it and I need to keep focus.  Oh, I just realized that I don't particularly feel like sitting here anymore. It is too humid.  I am also hungry.  My wallet is at home so I have to rely on my roommate to have prepared dinner but I told her not to because I have to be self-sufficient.  She isn't my girlfriend anymore.  I need to move on.  I think that means staying late at work more often.  This is officially my last year.  I need to end on a high note, though.  I am trying like MAD to stay positive and organized and do things right.  I have to keep myself in the good graces of everybody concerned.  I have to leave here on the same good note that I came in on.  Oh, I can't mess up.  I am trying. Staying late today to organize my stuff is the first step.  I don't know what the second is.  Well, off to organize and then go home, hungry!

      I am still at work. I am working on my CV, though, and researching more graduate school programs because I am determined to do this the right way and get into my first choice and have my first choice actually be THE perfect school/program for me.  It's a goal I think is important to strive for, don't you think?  It's fun to work on my CV except I don't know if I am providing too much information...I will ask several people for their opinions before I consider it complete.

      Well, today was spent rather productively but I felt kind of disillusioned for some reason.  I feel lonely lately and don't know why.  It's like I am disconnected from the world, you know?  Oh well, though, I haven't got a choice in how I spend my time because it is so important to me that this year begins on a HIGH note. I want to be organized, up-beat, prepared, excited, enthusiastic, and able to commit to following through on what is expected of me.  My students are starting to return in preparation for Orientation and I am getting more and more nostalgic. Orientation always makes me a bit nostalgic. This is going to be my 7th here. I have worked all of the 6 that weren't my own!  Imagine that.  I truly feel connected to this place.  I do.  Unfortunately, right now I am in the middle of start-up but have to think about the next year in terms of both current moment and future.  I need to think of things in terms of what is needed to have my replacement ready to hit the ground running...with a clue.  I have so much in my head from living and breathing this place for so long. I can't belive this is the beginning of my 7th year. It's not long compared to some people but, honestly, it's one of the longest times I have been in one place. That is probably why I am more attached to the campus than any of the places where I have lived. I guess my home is where the heart is and that is with my family and on this campus.  Of course, the cats, too, but never really in the physical space that I occupy as my dwelling.  The apartments/house all represent different periods in my life and honestly, each of the years of my life is as different as the three places are...if that makes sense.  Let's see, now, it's 5:30 on a Friday evening and I have no plans to go home anytime soon because what's there for me?  Laundry. Hungry, hot, lonely cats. Laundry, bills to pay (some overdue), the reminder that I live with somebody who is a good friend but I wish could/wanted to be more to me, the cat box that probably needs cleaning, the dishes that need to be put away and the dishwasher that will then have to have the current piles of dirty dishes loaded into it, laundry, an empty bird feeder, my messy room...the list goes on.  I just like the office b/c everything has a purpose. No, not really, but, well, I spend SO MUCH more time in this office than anywhere else.  I am also in love with my computer.  I love having a speedy internet connection. Having information at my fingertips is so appealing to me. I think I am addicted to information and communication.  Well, I guess I should get back to work and then do some graduate school business. Perhaps start my statement of purpose...oh wait, that would require knowing which program I want to do.  That's sort of daunting.  Lovely. Just lovely.  Okay, I am hot and sweaty and stinky...the office is going to still be here on Monday.  I am going to do some graduate school stuff now.

      God bless America, land that I love.  Stand beside her and guide her...  Yeah, that's been running through my head today.  I don't know why, really. I just don't know why.    I think I am getting my period b/c all I want to do is cry. You needed to read that, yes?  :-)    Nothing really alarms me but everything is a chore lately.  Truly, everything.  Students come back to school soon and I am beginning to fear that I will not be prepared.  I am much more prepared at this point in the summer than I was last year and I am doing it all for the 3rd time; that should help.  Oh yes, the joys of life.  I am beginning to get ready to do this graduate school thing.  Oh the joys!

      A friend of mine has to be away tonight into tomorrow so I am picking up her 2 girls at daycare and staying with them tonight and tomorrow night.  I will take them to daycare, of course, but you know, be "mom" for tonight, tomorrow morning, Thursday evening, and potentially Friday morning... Yeah.    Along with that, life is life at work (ORIENTATION, can I say? Start of the program year, can I say? End of the grant year, can I say?) and home (roommate didn't get job she should have so needs another one ASAP so she can tell her current "employers" where to go as soon as possible...I won't be home until Friday evening and forgot comfortable shoes to wear Thursday and Friday...day before and day of Orientation...I have food that my roommate won't eat so I should but won't be there to eat it and forgot to bring it...I will miss my cats... um, the list could go on).  Yeah, that and the reason my friend has to be out of town isn't a pleasant one.  It involves court and stupid people.  Nothing she  did  but stuff that  happened to  her...no more will I say on that except that it's just an unfortunate situation that NOBODY should have to face.  Ever.  Never, ever, ever.    ANYway...I just wish I could sleep, uninterrupted, for 8 hours and wake up rested, refreshed, and ready to start the day with a smile.  I think that  might  happen tonight. UNLESS the children are wild... I can honestly tell you I don't know what to expect... Kids. They're 3 and 4 and adorable but ... yeah.  There's always a "but," isn't there?  Especially with children.  They don't care if you've had a bad day at work and want to sleep in.  They will miss Mommy and want HER to tuck them in.  Can you blame them?  I can't.  I will keep you (faithful reader, if you exist....out there, somewhere...perhaps...?) posted.

      Well, the students will soon arrive and life will begin anew on campus. This is my 7th beginning of the year. I have not missed one Orientation in as many years.  It's one of my favorite times of the year.    I think back to all of my days on this campus and become very nostalgic. SO much has happened to me in this place and I have grown, watched others grow, had my heart broken, broken others' hearts (or at least, an other's heart), learned so much, taught so much, had great times, horrible times...I was here for 9-11-01...survived an earthquake in '98...so many things. Little things, HUGE things, funny things, tragic things, memorable things...Seen famous people and people who will be famous someday...Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Madeline Albright, and MANY MANY others...many others.  I have worn many hats...student, teacher, mentor, facilitator, manager, disciplinarian, trouble maker, peacekeeper, lover, loved, friend, girlfriend, audience member, honored...the list goes on.  Right now, I am sitting in my office working on a goal setting project and thinking about a training I will co-facilitate tomorrow... Thinking about what I wore when I matriculated... jeans that I would DIE to fit into again and my Hard Rock cafe Orlando t-shirt that is now so faded and worn that I am contimplating making it into rags!  Time passes. Things change...somethings, though, stay the same.  It's those things that are harder to identify.  Truly.  I know I have gained so much (75+) lbs in my time here.  I know I have had different hair styles.  Different students have come and gone, lived and even died...HWS babies have been born, several, in fact.  Marriages have been made... SO many differences and changes...the flow of time.  What stays the same, though?  Even this office is moving soon.  Moving to a remodeled building...the 2nd oldest building on campus.    It's symbolic in a way...that building.  It's the 2nd oldest yet the most recently remodeled...housing offices that have never before been together but do timeless work...Offices that touch the lives of so many across the GLOBE, really.  I will be there for the first semester of its use but then, I will move on.  The plant I got under the Orientation tent 7 years ago died recently because the cats chewed it.  The plant that I got during my senior brunch 26 months ago has doubled in size over the summer.  I cried when the first plant died.  It really made me sad.  Knowing that this is my last year here is difficult.  I find myself trying to rationalize staying...staying in my home...my comfort zone.  Moving again is traumatic, yes...living SO FAR from my family will be extremely difficult, I know...meeting new people will be exciting...learning new things and becoming a Ph.D. will be a dream come true.  Yes, a dream.  Ever since I knew what it meant, I have wanted to become a Ph.D.  A dream I will live.  I will make sure of it.  Dr.  Two letters and a period.

Anyway, I was in the mood to type so I thought I would try this but perhaps I ought to do my graduate school statement of purpose instead.    Okay, bye.

      Well, I survived the children and I survived the weekend and I survived the first day of school.  So far so good.  Life isn't bad, really, I just need to sit down and take a few minutes to myself.  Of course, I don't plan things so they'll happen that way.    I also taught my first class today. I am excited about that, really, as it's great experience and I get to meet new people, etc.  Oh, life.  So many things.  I just realized today that I have to sit down and write something "scholarly" to submit with my graduate school applications because I haven't written anything lately and the stuff I have written before isn't really that super. UGH. More time spent on this shit. LOVELY.  I just want to register for my GRE soon but keep forgetting. I need a million dollars and a week off.  Ha ha ha.  On that note, off to my friend's house to see her children -- the ones I stayed with the other night and took care of and who didn't want me to leave b/c they wanted me to "stay forever with them."  Yeah, that was a special one.  How do you respond to that when coming from the most adorable 3 and 4 year old children ever?  It wasn't easy, I will say that.  Okay, bye!

It is quite a process.  Oh, okay, well, going to close this down and do AIM and grad stuff.  Prepare for the hurricane if you have to!

      So, I have had a very interesting few days.  Definitely a time I will never forget.  Feel like I'm floating on air.  *sigh*  Work hasn't been treating me too horribly and I feel slightly caught up but never really can get ahead.  Chalk that up to "senioritis" I guess.   Whoops! Students coming for a meeting at 4:30.  Good thing she's early or I'd have been gone...want to go home.  Well, I don't want to go home but I am going home. I really would rather be...um, somewhere else.

      So, it's Friday and I am sitting in my basement office thinking about the weekend.  My life is just so fascinating right now. Everything is new and exciting. Fun times.  My boss has a new laptop and it's nicer than mine.  It's faster and the programs look different and it's thinner. Of course, mine has a cd burner in it and I have yet to figure out how to use it. Today we're going to install all the scanner and digital camera software onto Ave's computer so we can have students scan things and actually make use of the two pieces of newly acquired technology.  I am going to organize my desk and little corner of the office today after I go shopping for my exciting scrapbook materials. It's the only time before the class on Tuesday. The only pissy thing is, I don't have my BANK CARD or CHECKBOOK so nobody can cash a check for me and I SO wanted to go shopping today.  :-(  Oh well. I will just get the scrapbook stuff.  Ooooh...my student assistant is finished so I can be on my own computer now. Lovely.

      Life is grand.  Life is busy but grand.  Life is busy, grand, and fulfilling.  All that said, I am tired. A good tired.  This week I have had something to do each evening and it's been all good so far and I anticipate nothing overly dramatic in the days to come.  Monday:  I worked on preparation for "next steps" like graduate school personal statement, job applications, CV creation, and resume update  I also hung out with a friend of mine.  Until quite late.  Tuesday:  I had my last class of Literacy Volunteers  Wednesday: (today) I was supposed to have the first GRE study group that I started but I have to have dinner with somebody instead and finish up a proposal we're working on together for a conference in April.  Then, at 7:30 there's a Fisher Center talk about cyber censorship.  Interesting.  I was going to skip it and hang out at somebody's house instead but I think I really want to go.  Thursday: There's a PRIDE potluck at Community Service House and I am going with Lisa.  Should be, um, interesting.  Friday: Hanging out with Michelle at Big Lots and Wal-Mart then going to the school's play.    Saturday: Presenting at a conference/workshop day for local childcare givers.  Then, babysitting Nathaniel and Chamberlain.  Sunday:  ThE oNLy DaY to Do NoTHinG in FoREveR  Monday: Back starts the week through Wednesday and then Thursday, flying to NC for my weekend of conference fun. Sunday is a day off so I will study in the hotel and hang out in Chapel Hill. FUN TIMES.  Okay, back to work. It's stinky in here and I don't know why.  Smells like a hamster cage but not dirty, just natural woods or something like that. It's weird. Strangeness never ceases around here, I guess.

      Well, I just found out that I am going to have to drive out to CT with a friend tonight.  I don't want to do this.  It's horrible.  I just don't know what to do.  I'll have to be gone on Wednesday and tomorrow... Poor Ave. My boss is going to wonder what the hell is going on.  Life is just throwing things left and right.

      So, it's snowing and windy and the power was on and off at home.  The office was okay, thankfully.  The snow, though, is funny.  Sure, we're used to it but some schools closed early, etc. I swear.  It's insane.    So, on Tuesday, Renee and I are driving out to Cambridge!  Well, Braintree.  I'm going to the open house on Wednesday evening at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.  VERY exciting.  We're going to spend Wednesday hanging out in either Boston or around Harvard Square or both and then going to the open house.  Then, we'll drive back REALLY early on Thursday morning so we can be back around 1pm.  Yes, to go to work.  I am very excited to take a mid-week trip and miss a day of work and go somewhere fun and look at my potential new home for next year and hopefully the future.  We'll see.  So, that's my life.  Very exciting to me, perhaps not to you.  In any case, that's the latest.

      Well, it's been a crazy day.  I got up late.  Pretty late.  So, then, I was late for work and I had to pick up leaf bags at the waste water treatment plant and then came to the office where I was greeted with a message that my friend was in the ER with her kids and she needed to have somebody pick up the older one there at the ER and then drop her off at school.  So, from 10-12 I was sort of but by no means really a kind of "mom."    So, then, I spent the afternoon procrastinating at work.  Then, the computer tech man came and made my computer go over to the new system and now I don't like it.    So, then, my friend who is fighting a nasty custody battle found out some information that is making her sad.  I think I might send her flowers.  Truly.  So, then, my happy friend who I haven't seen in forever and I made plans.  :-)  Yippee.  I might get to go to Harvard next week for an open house.  FUN times.

      So, I am sitting here with my cat curled up in the crook of my knee on the couch and my other leg elevated with the laptop resting safely above the sleepy cat.  Typing with a 14 lb. cat on your hands is nearly impossible, trust me.  He meows every so often to make sure I am still paying attention "only" to him and if I don't respond with a promp pat on the head, he looks back as if to tell me he's just about ready to jump on the keyboard that is taking my hands off of him.  How dare I.  Why, you ask, am I typing at 5:15 AM on a work day?  Good question, friend!  Good question indeed.  Well, I haven't slept very well and when I woke up at 4:30 with indegestion and the desire to write my graduate school personal statement, I took advantage of that, went downstairs, hooked up the computer, and began typing. True, I have a paragraph and have spent the past 30 mins online and am now typing this but I have a start and I am in the zone, so to speak.  There's an open house at the HGSE next Wednesday and I think I am going to go.  I want my mom to go but if she can't will ask my grandmother. I doubt Renee will be able to but if she wants to, she can. I'd rather share it with my MOMMY though. Isn't that funny?  Graduate school and I immediately want my MOM there.  Interesting.    So, if I end up going out to Cambridge on Wednesday morning, I will just miss two days of work. Actually, I would probably go to work on Thursday afternoon, depending on what time I get back home.  I don't know if my mom can take time off of work to do this. She'd have to drive out here on Wednesday morning early so we can leave here by 9:30 AM and that would mean missing Wednesday. Then, we'd stay over-night on Wednesday and drive back Thursday. I'd LIKE to make trip of it but reality forbids such frivolity.  Whoops.  I didn't respond soon enough to the demands of my cat and he is climbing on the keyboard ... ooh... he's now on his way to the kitchen.  Okay...time for him to cause trouble and meow his brains out.  His departure, though, gives me the mobility to type much more efficiently so, I bid you, faithful reader(s???) adieu.

      Well, life is strange. Just when you think you know what is going on, you find yourself sadly mistaken.  Well, at least you think you find yourself sadly mistaken.  Or, maybe you don't really know and one moment of freak out ruins something that had GREAT potential.  Or, maybe this is a necessary break in something that you think might happen again someday.  Or, maybe it was a mind-game and the other individual involved had NO idea what she was doing either and decided to just take what she could get (and boy...did she GET) and then when she wanted to move on and play with the next unsuspecting individual...bye bye.  The vibes I am picking up are so strange and I can't figure anything out.  Life just kicked my ass over the past few weeks and I didn't deal with things very well.  I guess I am a wuss.  Or something like that.  So, then, when you decide that what is the best for you has been under your nose the entire time, does that mean you are truly aware or that you freaked out and went to what is the most comfortable?  So, then, if you decide what you thought it was that you wanted (you know, the thing under your nose the entire time) isn't really what you want...what then?  Or, well, what if you just want to leave it all behind and start over?  How can you do that without being a complete and total bitch?  I have been led astray because I KNEW what I want and knew what I was getting myself into and so, the other individual didn't realize that I was truly serious about that and thought I couldn't be taken seriously.  She then, well, either realized that I was serious and SHE freaked out or she had been using me all along.  Am I that gullible?  Should I just wash my hands of the entire thing?  Do I still want her?  That life?    Truly, sitting here all day with NOTHING to do except constantly check my e-mail, waiting for a response... it sucks.  That and, well, I just don't know... I just don't know.  Confusion shouldn't mean drama and why does it have to?  Why should my age matter?  The pivotal point that I am in right now is scary.  Just so scary.  Truly...  Graduate school is going to take me out of the area.  Syracuse and Cornell are close and I could apply there. I could get in there.  I should go there.  I wouldn't have to move but moving is a good thing. What if the living situation isn't well, the best thing for me?  What if I need to get out of there.  Oh, and then this entire new relationship thing... Well, now, here's something... I knew what I was getting myself into and I wanted it.  I said things--all of which are true.  I just freaked out.  I freaked out because I saw what I wanted and knew at some level that it wouldn't become mine.  That's it.  That's it.  Unbelieveable.  So, yeah. Life goes on. Graduate school is closing in on me and I am afraid that I won't get my recommendations in on time.  I am a loser. I am truly a loser.  Okay, well, that's my little rant.  What the hell am I going to do? I need to take care of myself. MYSELF.  What is "my" "self" anyway?  That's a topic for another rant.  And another.... and another...

      Nobody must read mine anymore b/c nobody has asked who is pregnant.  Of course, my blog shouldn't announce who it is so maybe I shouldn't have mentioned it.  Hadn't realized that I did, actually, until just now when I went to post.  Whoops.  Anyway, I am writing to the president (of the school) asking him to write on my behalf for graduate school.  Everybody says I should so, I am.  I don't want to but it might help. That and the 5.5/6 on my GRE analytical writing.  I am really excited but the cost of living near Harvard kind of intimidates me. The name, though, you can only beat that by a few schools... That, and the program is pretty much exactly what I want.  Oh, the excitement.  My girlfriend, or as she calls herself, my "mistress," just came down to visit me in my office.  Her secretary just called her away.  That's okay, though, I have work to do and she's leaving soon to go home to get ready to leave for Thanksgiving.    Speaking of Thanksgiving...  I am excited! My parents and brother are coming to get me by 4:30 (I/they hope) so we can drive as far as we get on our way to Grandpop's.  It'll be fun b/c the Oregon girls will be there, too. I haven't seen Liz since Ireland so we'll get to share our stories/my pictures.  Fun times.  Jen's in college and just turned 19 so...whoops on the no mail to her ever.  Bad cousin that I am.    We might be going to the Christmas village on Friday! I am psyched about that but also annoyed b/c the weather was supposed to have been warmer than it appears it will be in reality.  At least I found my winter stuff. The only thing, I just realized that I forgot my cuddle duds.  Oh well.  Cold legs happen.  Let's see, then on Saturday, we're taking Jen back to school at American then looking at the U of MD @ College Park.  My 2nd choice program.  Ugh... this grad school business truly dominates my life.  Well, right now I am going to finish the president's email.  Scary but necessary.

      Well, since I last posted, I have been through a lot.  I did NOT go to CT with my friend. She didn't go, either, because of the weather and her kid was sick.  SO, that was a bit of a stress-free moment when I realized I was not going afterall.  What I did do, though, was go to Harvard last week for an open house at the graduate school of education.  It looks like a great program and I am excited about it.  So, my applications are going well, I hope.  I am still applying there and to the Ph.D. program in WMST at the University of Maryland.    I got the GRE official scores in the mail and I earned a 5.5 out of 6 on the analytical writing sample.  Since that's a better measure than the other two parts of my own work, I feel slightly less cranky about taking the stupid test. I still wish that it didn't have to exist.  Oh well.  So, that's that.  Let's see...what else can I talk about...?  I don't know.  SO many choices.  Tonight I am going over to a friend's house with pizza when I should be at home cleaning my room and packing for Thanksgiving.  I might end up sleeping there but, well, I don't think that's a good option. Who knows.  Honestly, relationships are just freaky things that happen between two people and then are thought about too much.    I mailed off two letters for people to write for me today and e-mailed a third. Ave said he'd have mine done before break (which one? probably Christmas) and I have Lisa's.  She'll tailor it for me, I am sure.  I don't know who else to ask... Everybody said I should ask the President and I should ask the dean but keep forgetting...or chickening out...I am a wuss.  Let's see...it's 6pm and I am picking up dinner in another hour and a half!  Then, going to you-know-who's for dinner and whatever comes next.  Then, tomorrow I have work and Wednesday I have work and well, then it's Thanksgiving.  I should write my graduate school stuff right now.

      Well, I thought I posted yesterday...whoops.  I just read Nadia's and she's in the Christmas spirit... I was going to type about how I am in the Christmas spirit!  How funny.  Well, it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas because...well, we have a ton of snow and it is frigid.  Yes, frigid.  As in below freezing... in the teens and twenties... during the day...with the sun out.  Yes, that is frigid.  So, my update is complete.  Christmas shopping on Thursday to a craft store b/c I am making most of my family gifts this year. :-)  Lucky them.  Lucky me.  Oh, and maybe lucky you...I am contimplating making my Christmas cards, too.

      I can't believe Malana didn't choose Adam.  It just made me want to cry.  The look on his face!  Ugh.  Anyway, yes, I admit it ... I watched  Average Joe .  Not all of them, no.  Just the last three...so, that's more than half, I guess, as I think there were only 5 episodes.  I don't think I plan to watch the next one. It'll lose the excitement for me.  See, I was thinking about it last night and I have watched the last two or at least very last episode of several "reality" shows over the past few years.  Back in the day, I think I watched a few episodes of  Survivor --one of the orginals, if not the original.  I watched the last episode of that stupid show that Monica Lewinsky hosted where the guys wore the masks.  I watched a few of  The Bachelor  episodes at different points and I watched a few of the last episodes of one or two of  The Bachelorette .  The first  American Idol   with Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini (whoa, can't spell) wasn't something I ever thought I would watch but the last two episodes got us so hooked that we watched the entire second season and called in more times than I would like to admit on more phones than I would like to admit.    I always liked  The Real World  back in the day (Boston is one of my favorites and the first New York) and even watched it as recently as New Orleans ... no, actually...as recently as part of Las Vegas.  I don't know what attracted me to it but whatever it was is probably what made millions and millions of Americans watch it and then the networks created all of these so called "reality" TV shows.  It's just interesting to me that they've become so popular but they're not really reality now because people have become used to them and know the culture of watching them and so when they're on one, they act a different way.  Renee was teasing me last night that I should be the first one on a Lesbian Bachelorette.  I don't know what they'd call it but it's only time until that happens. There was a gay one. I watched a few but didn't really make it to watch more because of the time slot, I think.  It must have competed with something else or, Renee just hated it so much that I lost the battles?  I don't know.  What was that called? I forget... Oh well.  Another show that I used to watch was  Road Rules .  I liked that show because of the places they'd visit and the RV.  Those were some pretty great shows.    Well, enough reflection on my TV viewing habits. Back to work I go.  I have a busy day today and in less than two hours, I have to leave the office for what could be the day.  Meaning, all the work at my desk will be delayed...again.

      MERRY CHRISTMAS (if that's your thing)  Last night I had to go because my dad wanted to go to bed and the computer (even though it's  a laptop) is in the living room where he has to sleep because I am in his room with the babies.  Anyway, it's weird being home but it's okay.    Today, Matthew and I are going shopping. STUPIDity but it's his need, not mine so I feel like my own early (ha ha ha) shopping wasn't put to waste.  I think we're going to surprise the parents with a printer.  He's getting mom some water filter, or something and he has to get something else...I forget what.  Right now, I have to wrap his friends' gifts, clean up the kitchen and dining room, and the living room.  Then, shower time.  He's sleeping, of course.  I'll wake him when I am finished.  OH man, stop showing us the poor cows with MAD COW!    OH man, stop showing that horrid picture of Michael Jackson.  Ugh.  News.  So many sad things...  Well, the dog is jumping around right now.  He's all happy that both of his kids are here.  Of course, he'd love to play with the cats, too, but he scares them...well, Max.  Maya likes dogs, I think.  They're not as pink as she is so they don't threaten her beauty status.  No, she's not that superficial.  Poor cat.  -------------  Back to what I was talking about last night...  I am frustrated because I can't really talk about my own life with people because it's so "controversial."  Part of me says to suck it up and just force people to listen to expose them...but that's not easy, either.  So, I've taken to talking about other people's lives.    Frustrating.  Oh, how cute! They've got preschoolers talking about santa. They're so cute!  babies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  sigh...I want kids.    Okay, better stop thinking about myself...back to work...   MERRY CHRISTMAS!

      Well, I am home now at my parents' house for Christmas.  It's weird. The cats are upstairs in my dad's room and that's where I will be for the week.  My mom has to work just about every single day. Daddy works tomorrow and all the non-Christmas days.  We're going to church tomorrow and then to the family celebration which will be two families combined because Aunt Peggy's family is getting smaller. Then, Christmas will be at Grandma's house with EVERYBODY, literally.  It's going to be sad...but fun.  Mommy works, of course.  So, when will I be able to talk about my life the way it really is instead of leaving things out? It's getting harder and harder.  Well, at least I haven't found somebody who I plan to live with forever and ever. That's when I will have to start figuring out how to talk about well, my life.  I am thinking that I am the only one who isn't straight in my immediate pool of cousins.     Um, I am going to have to go now.

      It's 11 a.m. on the day before Christmas Eve and I am supposed to be packing the office but apparently, my motivation is gone today.  I'm sad because I miss the women in my life.  Ugh.  Being in love sucks.  No, not really. I just miss them and neither have called me or anything.  I guess I am never going to find the ONE.  Okay, going to finish packing.

      Happy 2004!  Well, I am officially torn...  The crises in my life are so "lame" compared to what they could be and I recognize that but since they are my "tragedies" I will bask in them and treat them accordingly.  So there.  I left my parents' house and got here and decided not to go to work.  The only reason I was going to go was so I could see Lisa.  I want to stay here and I want to stay here because I want to be home and settled.  The only way it appears that I will get to see her is if I give up my tomorrow and spend it at the mall with her and the girls.  As tempting as that sounds, I want to stay home.  I don't know if I will work on my graduate school stuff, spend time with Renee, or what but, well, I feel ... torn.  My stomach is in knots...   Hey, it's the Real World Hawaii after Ruthie left to get her drug shit taken care of...  I didn't watch it at this point... She's playing with this half naked woman right now...Um, weird...um, now they're naked in the pool... Yes, I remember this...she walks around topless.  Yes...Ick.  Perhaps I ought to change the channel.  Okay, enough of that ... back to the real issues...  I am trying to get myself settled down but it's just getting worse.  I feel like I am right back in the middle of this (well, I am) but I don't want this anymore...  I am seriously in love with (and attracted to...and all that) with two women and well, it's sort of something that I thought I could handle but I have just started to give up myself too much so I need to take myself back, establish boundaries...not jump when I am asked to--even if I really want to...The possibilty of becoming frustrated is seriously there...but, if I don't jump, I am giving it up...or at least risking giving it up...She's crazy.  Real World San Diego looks stupid...it hasn't be aired yet but there was some rape case...oh, nd Holy crap...yes, I didn't change the channel...oh, cats...they're cute...I will have to watch now...oh, and maya is climbing on me... the lesbians on Real World are happy together...oh, and the third one... Wow...okay, sorry....new topic...  So, what ... I think I am signing off now... I have to sit still and get myself sorted out... Jesus.  Okay...

      So, that movie...it ended up being sort of good. My mom didn't like it, though, because it was "artsy" and "made her think."  My dad said she doesn't like movies that are heavy and that it had nothing to do with the gay theme that emerged all of a sudden.  I have to finish it at some point but it's due tomorrow by noon. Oh well.  We'll see if I get to finish it...gay theme and all.  In her words..."I love mindless movies."  So, that says it all.  When my dad and I went to Blockbuster, I bought three tapes that were buy 2 get 1 free so they averaged $6 each!  Very exciting.  I got  Bread   and   Roses  (GREAT Italian film about a woman who is left behind by her family on vacation and explores Venice by herself and then finds happiness there...),  Miss Congeniality  (which I don't think I own), and  Bend it Like Beckham  (sigh...very good film).  So now I own them.  Very exciting!  Oh, great...Another one is getting married.  My oldest friend (from VA, when I was 4 and she was 3) is getting married in June.  Just found out on IM.  I won't tell my mom because she gets all funny.  Ugh...someday....someday maybe I will make her happy. No matter what I do...she'll have an empty feeling, I know it.  Harvard or not...Sheesh, I guess I do things for her more than I realize...trying to make up for not being the perfect daughter that she dreamt of...sigh.  Sorry, Mommy. I am sorry that I am a gay disappointment.  That brings me to the graduate school application process.  Ugh.  It's my fault that I let it get this far. I am so nervous about it that I just put it to the back burner and, well, leave it there.  So, now I pay the price and type like mad...about god only knows what.  ARGH.  Both Renee and Lisa want to read it and have offered very kindly...I just am not really into sending it off to them, even though I KNOW I need some serious guidance because I am procrastinating.  Blah.  I just want it so bad so I feel so guilty about letting this happen but I have this sick expectation that I will get everything I want and then I know I will be stupid if I count my chickens before they're hatched.  Ugh...I hate using expressions...but it's fitting.  Well, let's see...TODAY, I saw The Return of the King.  It was cute. Liv was in it slightly more than she was in the others...which is always fun to watch.  That blonde chick didn't do it for me.  She was good, though.  Ahhh...actresses.  Sigh.  So, enough about that.  :-)  Let's talk about love.  Let's talk about how my stomach feels whenever I see the kind of car Lisa drives, NC plates, the kind of car Renee drives...or either of their names.  Let's talk about how my stomach feels whenever I think about...well, right now, I am just smitten for Lisa.  I am.  It's just the way I feel and I can't explain exactly what it is.  I wish I could just settle down in a nice home with the perfect woman and have perfect children and...find the perfect job...and make decent money...oh GOODNESS it's frustrating to think about all of the possibilities... ARGH.  Hmmm...I wonder what people think about me.  I'm 24 w/o a boyfriend and have never dated or brought a boyfriend around.  I've even brought girls around for things that would be reserved for the boyfriend...holiday, etc.  None of my family members pester me about boyfriends and none of my out of town friends ask me if I have a boyfriend.  Do I exude lesbian vibes or something?????????????????  Seriously, I just wonder.  I guess Jennifer's mom asks her if I have a boyfriend and even though Jennifer always says no and then proceeds to talk about the various women in my life, her mom "hasn't caught on."  Whatever.  It's just something I wonder about because well, I am always curious about what people think of me and how I am perceived.  Would anybody ever have the courage to ask me?  I don't know.  I just don't know.  Grrrr...now I am obsessed with marriage.  Maybe Joshie will marry me.  Poor Joshie...he's my boy toy...and my only hope for a male partner...who wouldn't be a partner...and is shorter than me so the wedding would be funny looking anyway...grrr....but the funniest part would be my family (the uncles and beyond, not immediate family) reacting to me marrying somebody who isn't white.  Hey, I'd love it!  It would be a MAN but not a white man so ... yeah, I'd just laugh.  Anyway, enough of this...back to IM and then upstairs to type my graduate school bullshyte.

      Have you ever really KNOWN and felt the meaning of "out of sight, out of mind" and wished you didn't?  Of course, I am also in constant sight of another and seemingly "out of mind" at the same time.    Lately, I just feel "blah" and wish I had some spice in my life.  No, that's not true. I have plenty of spice--new office...um, well, maybe that's not spice and maybe that's not plenty.  In any case, I am feeling a bit lonely in the relationship sense of the word... Of course, since I was reprimanded for using this inappropriately (by my roommate), I guess I am going to have to stick to my non online journal.  But...there is something appealing about just venting quickly at work and then moving on with my tasks.  I just want a girlfriend who isn't insane, who likes to have sex, who can have fun with me, who wants to be with me--no, not all the time, but, well...somebody who calls me to set up plans and who wants to ... basically, I want myself cloned.  Strange, yes, I realize.  I don't really mean that...I just mean that I want somebody who is like-minded about time spent together--how much and how.    Right now, I am in limbo with TWO people. Hey, whatever.  It's just getting old and I am ready to move away. Of course, I didn't send the second graduate application because I want the first program so much.  I am a bit lazy and everybody would KILL me if they knew I didn't send it.  Whoops.  So, if I don't get in...I don't know WHAT I will do.  Honestly.  I am fairly stupid for not sending the one...  OH WELL.  Spiting myself...what's that expression...that's like the nose spiting the face? Yeah, that one.  Oh, an e-mail...probably just something lame.    Gotta play work now.

      I am writing from my beautiful new office!  If you've ever had a beautiful new office after living in a crumby, windowless basement office for several years...then you know my excitement.  I have a window; and if I lean the right way, a lake view!  I have a door--frosted glass.  I have enough (extra) space to put everything away so it's not cluttering my desk.  I hope this space is a beautiful space.  Right now, I have to go out to shop but need to take my boss home. D'oh. Guess I have to fly back to a store after getting home. Grrr.  Okay, time to go.  Just wanted to blog from the new office. If you know me and know where it is and are around, come and vist!!!

      Oh, I forgot the point of the blog...  I don't like not being home all the time.  I want to figure out where I will settle and then I want to find somebody to settle with and then I want kids. That is it. I am officially convinced of that.  No, maybe not.  If I had kids, I couldn't travel...who says?  Oh, I am never sure of anything, am I?  Oh well.  I am sure of one thing but I won't write about it here b/c then I would be accused of something by somebody somewhere.  It's not inappropriate to profess my lack of a certain enjoyable activity b/c my two options are...well...one is crazy, sick, and doesn't live here.  The other ...  whatever.  Hey, leave Brittney Spears alone.  I'm glad she got herself some...if getting married in Vegas was the way, good for her for thinking of that.  Go Britney.  I would like to say that I own and listen to all of her CDs.    Um, the man on TV just said "shit" and it wasn't bleeped.  Oh, and the other day, in that Pink song, they didn't bleep out the part where she says bitch.  Whatver.

      Well, I think I am officially 100% certain that I don't want a job that requires much travel.  I just got back from a Wed-Sunday stint in MA.  I missed the cats and my roommate.  While I would have rather been sleeping in the hotel bed, I did miss my own space. Unfortunately, I have decided that I would rather live in a hotel that was neat all the time, not by my own hand, than in my house.  Of course, I like my own stuff and I am not lazy but...it's nice to have a place for everything and have everything always in its place.   Wow, my cats are adorable.  They love the cat beds I bought them for Christmas.  It's too cute.  Jim Carey is ON something. I am convinced of it.  We're watching him on an awards show and he's just a freak.

      I need to vent. I am doing this during work and I am going to just go crazy.  I got a message ON MY WORK VOICE MAIL from Lisa when I got here this morning (WHY the HELL she didn't call me at HOME, I will NEVER know) just telling me to call her...So, this morning, I called her and she was all evasive and "it wasn't a good time" because she was at the dance class. UM...she's told me in the past that she just waits in a waiting room area...anyway, she acted like she had told me this stuff before but she's "having babysitter issues" so she's ... Oh, I don't care.   I'm just going to have to focus on my work right now and not think about the ... other crap ... right now.  So, if I have to use my two free tickets for MYSELF, I will just go alone.  I am now, at this moment, officially DONE with her.  NO MORE. She's crazy.

      Just wanted to blog this week...before February started and I hadn't typed since mid-January.  I just muted my computer and wondered why the music stopped.  That's where my brain is today.  Well, my view (from the beautiful new office) has become more interesting!  Today, I noticed a "port-a-potty" left over from the days of construction.  I also saw a student out on the fire escape smoking. Thankfully, he was fully clothed and was only smoking a regular cigarette.  When I get my glasses, I will probably be able to see into the windows, which I don't want to do.  Oh well.  Speaking of glasses--I made TWO doctor's appointments yesterday.  I'm getting my eyes done on the 13th and then on the 16th, I have to go to my regular doctor for something else.  I won't bother detailing it here but let's say ... well, no, nevermind. It's not a big deal but, I find it funny to say "If I didn't know any better, I could be giving birth in 4 months at the rate I've been NOT getting something I should."  :-)  Yes, I know, "TMI" but, it's news.  Or something like that.  I'm excited because there's a fun speaker coming tonight.  His books are a riot! I have one of them  Life's Little Deconstruction Book: Self-Help for the Post-Hip  and it's got 365 one-liners that CRACK me UP.  The little blurb on the front says "Po-Mo to go!"  That just about set me over the edege...calling "Post-Modernism" "Po-Mo."  I will share them with friends forever and ever.  I nearly put it on my nightstand so I could wake up and have a po-mo one-liner to live by each day.  Nah, I thought, that's too "orderly" for the nature of what they are.  What else?  I want a baby. That's now news, though, so I won't elaborate.  Just so many cute babies and children lately, that is distracting me from the focus of GRADUATE SCHOOL.  I only sent one application. That's okay, though, because I am moving to the Boston area in August (or September if I get into school--which starts at the END of September).  That's where I want to be.  Of course, somebody asked me if I would move to NY and I didn't automatically say "NO!" like I thought I would. Hmmm...the possibilities are endless, for me, because I am fun and competent.  What else?  I guess nothing.  Notice, though, that the above paragraph started with "I want a baby" and ended with talk about jobs...Yes, I am all over the place.  In just over an hour, I am going out to lunch.  Yummy. I need to get cash.    I love our student workers. They're so cute and funny.  They've GOT A CLUE, too, which is so good for Ave and me--we don't have to kick their asses or overcompensate for stupidity.  :-)  Time to work again.  Planning for Saturday.

      Okay, now, I am going to perpetuate the talk about this breast business.  Only, my take is...ENOUGH ALREADY!  You don't want kids to see it, STOP showing it on morning TV...and the noon news...and the evening news...and all times between. So, if you didn't see it at the moment it happened, you've defintely seen it now (unless you live in a place without TV, bless your soul) about ten thousand times.  Drop it. Enough Jacksons in the news.  Of course, it takes the focus off of wack-o and puts it onto Janet's boob...but STILL.

      So, did anybody else see Janet Jackson's boob fall out of her "shirt" during the halftime show tonight?  Just wondering.   Let's see, scholarship application boo boo keeping me stressed.  Getting up early tomorrow and going to work to finish what was due on Friday and I worked on during Christmas but not since then...  I also have to get a birthday card and baloon for tomorrow.  Lisa's birthday is Tuesday. Going to mail her card.  I have to go to the post office and mail Christmas gifts, return something to my mom (or I could take it this weekend?), and get tax forms. I need to do my taxes so I can finish the FAFSA so I can finish my financial aid application which is due on Friday.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Time for bed. NO LOUD CATS TONIGHT OR I WILL SCREAM.  Tomorrow, I will continue my search for the answer for whether or not Janet's boob flew out.

      I formally came out to my boss today.  Not a bad thing, he pretty much knew.  I just had to give him the details of this latest thing b/c I knew he'd appreciate them and then I would be sure that he had the story straight.  (heh heh, I said  straight )  So, it's funny but a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, one I didn't even know was there. Of course now I am worried that he'll act funny.  Probably not.  Not like he doesn't act funny anyway... Oh, whatever.   Let's see... EVERY little thing that happens to my body now scares me b/c of my potential disease--or syndrome--whatever.  I will be a bit more relaxed when I have had the blood work and sonogram to verify that it's treatable and nothing more serious than what my doctor said.  BUT still...that's nothing to be sneezed at.  The part about going to a dietician is daunting b/c I don't like dealing with weight and I am lazy and well, basically, I have a LOT of weight to lose and changes to make in my lifestyle (I hate that word).  I just need somebody to kick me in the ass about it and keep on me on a regular basis.  Okay, so now that I am officially not even somebody's "bitch on the side" (which is what I have taken to calling myself affectionately) it sucks to know that I am completely unattached--but not.  Yes, I have a very open marriage and can always count on Renee but...well, she even knows that she cannot give me the kind of relationship that I apparently want/need.  It is frustrating.  Very.  Valentine's Day is on Saturday.  I had big plans for something I was going to do for Renee but now, I don't know. I should probably just clean the house.  That would be nicest of all...slacker that I am.  What a stupid day, Valentine's Day.  I think only a very small handfull of times have I actually spent a nice, romantic day (or portion of a day) with my Valentine.  I always like doing things with my family...  Speaking of my family, I think I might just go back home if I don't get into graduate school.  Honestly, I would have to give up dating as I am intimidated by the largeness of where I would thus live.  Finding gay people would intimidate me...  Okay, it's snowing. I won't be home for FOUR more HOURS and I am cranky, tired, hot, and .... grrrr...

      I don't think I have ever been "dumped" until today.  Not that it really feels like I was dumpted b/c I wasn't really in a relationship per se.  But I would have to say that it's the closest thing to being dumped and I kind of hate it...probably not for the reasons you'd think.  Pouring my soul here...  Over lunch, I was told that the woman I have been seeing is dating somebody else.  It wasn't a shocker or anything but the relationship with this new woman and she are in the beginnings of what will most definitely become a public relationship.  The relationship she had with me, she wanted kept quiet b/c she wasn't sure if she was ready, blah blah blah.  Sure, she's going through a custody battle with a crazy woman...she didn't want her kids hurt...she didn't want whatever.  So, things got funny and we just fizzled but she kept doing stupid things to try and make me think we were still together in whatever form of together we had originally been... I didn't fall into her traps except when most convenient for me (sex) but when she pulled her shit last weekend, I was officially finished with her and knew she is, indeed, crazy.  So, this brings me to my reaction today. I was very mature and knew she'd say the name she did. Oh, and I also could have given her the easy out many times and called her up or told her that I was finished being involved with her as anything other than friends...  I didn't, though, b/c I wanted it to be her call and I didn't want her to have anything to ever, well, I don't know. I guess it was a power thing on my part.  Again, back to lunch.  She said that a few weeks ago she was going to tell me she didn't want to be with anybody and I, again, wouldn't have been surprised (in fact, I think she DID tell me that and that's where we'd left things...but, who's keeping track? Obviously neither of us...).  Then, well, last weekend she got into it with a professor ... a very butch woman who is a scientist --which is TOTALLY her type, as in, just about everything I am not.  :-)  Anyway, I wasn't surprised, I am not hurt or mourning what she and I had.  The thing that gets me is this... she never publically told anybody that she and I were together. She kept it all secret and maintained a lesbian life with all these other gays on campus and it didn't include me.  She totally maintained herself as this single damsel in distress to lure in the butchy types. And, bingo, she got one.  The president has "seen them together twice" ans so she figures it's going public, if it hasn't already, so she wanted to make sure I heard it from her.  How kind.    So, good. I'm glad she's go her public gay thing to go back to.  I was convenient.  That's fine with me.  I guess writing this has helped me enough.  I'm just peeved b/c she's all public with this bitch and I wasn't good enough to parade around with.  Hey, this other woman's reputation is scary so at least we all knew what was around each corner with me.  Her call.  But, nobody can ever say that I ditched her.  She left me behind and what a good thing she had.    One thing, though, I will definitely miss her children.  They are great girls.    So, that's where I stand. 100% single, officially, no sex in my future. No long distance relationship when I go off to graduate school.  Oh, and she'll NEVER let me forget that she introduced me to this program. DAMMIT...I wish she didn't have that on me.  OH well...it is what I let it be and if I treat it as nothing, it's nothing.

      I'm not thrilled right now b/c everything just makes me cranky.  I don't know why.  Things are not necessarily BAD, per se, but I am not thrilled.  I need to, in the words of Emeril, to "kick things up a notch."    I'm presenting at a conference on Saturday. Exciting.  Of course, I am mildly intimidated but I cannot let that continue. There is no reason that I should feel intimidated or inferior or anything.  There will be a professor and two students presenting with me and that's impressive for a panel--a professor, two undergraduates (sophomores even), and me, the mere administrator.  Good times.  Tonight's  American Idol   will be very exciting. There is a lesbian. Well, backing up...she looks like and presents herself like a butch-y woman. There very well could be other lesbians but they don't necessarily look like lesbians...this coming from me, I know, I know...  Anyway, I am rooting for her!    Let's see...what else?  I made meatballs last night.  They were good.  The ones I made last time were better--we now know that it's better to over-cook them.  :-)  Anyway, I am just down.  I don't know what it means or where it comes from... I'm just down.    There are so many variables right now...so many...that are out of my control.  I am not one of those people who lets life happen to me so when I am in a place where I have to do that...it's difficult.  Anyway, I am going to get back to work right now. There're always things to keep me busy...and then some!

      Well, I was officially a cranky bitch on Valentine's Day.  I guess I was a bit better yesterday and was definitely nice on Friday.  Ooops.  Yesterday, we saw a "rock opera" about a botched sex change operation.  It was funny but a bit too melodramatic for my taste.  The songs were good and so was the music and it had good-looking people in it.  Not a bad 90 minutes of my life, in the greater scheme of things.  Well, work is keeping me on my toes.  Tired today. Can't wait to get out of here.

      I have decided to create a list.  OKay, so you know what annoys me?  - ever since I was "dumped" by that woman, my primary (um, only?) source of campus gossip has disappeared  - I don't have Showtime so I can't watch  The L Word   - I feel like I don't have a life but I do if I could just get over the negative attitude I have developed  - BLOGGER doesn't have spell check  - forgetting to take my pills and then feeling the dizziness and nausea  - not knowing whether or not it's a good thing that my doctor hasn't called me today...  - that I don't have an, in Rachel's terms, "S.O."  - That I am annoyed by the above item  - pantyhose that aren't the size I should wear (if they're big, they fall down at my ankles and if they're small, they hurt around my waist)    I am annoyed. It's my mood lately--annoyed...can't be bothered...grumbly...cranky...distant...  Sometimes, I wish I could sit around and read, paint, crochet, shop, watch movies and even TV... It's settled. I need to find a rich, rich, rich woman who will "keep" me as her...whatever...and support my habits. I could lose weight with a personal chef and personal trainer...imagine... YES, I am a lazy bum.  That's me!  I miss my friends. I miss college. I miss the carefree days of undergraduate life. To think, the worries I had!  Oh man.  Being "dumped" by that woman...I miss the time she and I spent together.  I miss her kids. Oh man, it's kind of killing me and I can't talk to her about it because I don't want to be the wussy "younger woman" that I am convinced she thought I would be...at the same time, though, I hate thinking of her with that person she's with. Ick. I am nasty, yes.  I just wish I could say something to make her well, "take me back" or whatever other cliche statement I could fit in there.  I hate relationship stupidity.  I am CONVINCED that she and I would be ABSOLUTELY perfect together. PERFECT. It makes me sick to think about it...actually...and I should stop. I have a bunch of crap to do before the thing I need to attend tonight. HOPEfully it won't be a classic "nobody comes" event...I hate those.

      wow...it's been a while.  Well, let' see... I am definitely missing a lot on this site... Hmmm...  American Idol is no longer quite as much of an obsession as it was b/c I haven't been around to watch it...I didn't make last week's and I won't make this week's.  EITHER episode.  Oh well.  Nothing really exciting to report... It's warm, though! The weather is beautiful.  I got my car washed a few days ago. Nice.  Wow, students just crack me up. The things I hear.  The lies that are told.  Oh, life.  Ugh, right now, I have a headache...probably because I didn't take my pills lately...I did last night...or yesterday morning. Or something. Whoops.  Okay, eating dinner before my thing at 7. I hate staying on campus late when I don't feel like being here at all.

      I have been cleaning the house. What a chore, and then some. I bought a Swiffer wet jet and it's a blessing. I hate mopping like you wouldn't believe so having the throw away pad is wonderful--of course, it's like a diaper so the envrionmentally friendly part of me cringes when I use it--but not enough to make me not want to use it!  :-)  Right now, there's a student and her fiancee out in the office and they speak Spanish to each other. He keeps whispering. I want to yell out and say "I don't understand Spanish, so don't bother whispering!" But figure that's stupid.  So, I just ignore it.  Tonight, I am working until 7pm and if nobody shows up for the meeting that was going to be at 7, which I changed to 5 and 2 people out of the 7 came to...  Well, if nobody is here by 7:05, I am going to leave and go home to watch TV and eat dinner. I think I am going to treat myself for dinner because I can. I have been VERY GOOD and have been walking and moving, etc.  Obviously, I won't have something BAD for dinner, just something from not my house.  I need to cook dinner for Renee tomorrow night. She's coming home from a conference and will be happy to see the house clean.  I need to finish all that business tonight.    I also have to pack for my trip. I have a lot of packing to do and don't particularly want to go on this trip. It's going to be fun, and all, but it's such a chore to get ready. I had to buy clothing that can get dirty b/c I don't fit into anything anymore.  :-(

      Wow, it's been a week.  I haven't posted in an entire week...guess that's a testiment to how busy I have been.    I still wish blogger had spell check.  OH well. I guess I could type in another document and cut and paste into this. Or something like that.    Naw, too much work.  Let's see...what's new in my life?  Not much.  My family came to visit on Saturday. We met half way between their house and mine and spent the afternoon eating and shopping.  Fun times. I was sad when I called on Saturday morning and so they said they'd meet me half way. I was too lazy to drive all the way out there and I had things to do at home and couldn't spend the entire weekend with them but I missed them a lot. A LOT.  Oh, my doctor basically said all my results were normal except cholestorol and testosterone. Both idicating that I do have polycystic ovaries.  Hence no period--no ovulation.  It causes all my symptoms...excessive weight gain, et. al. SO, the way to naturally treat it...lose weight. THAT's fun...lose the weight that I thought I was crazy for putting on...the weight that the thing I am trying to get rid of is the cause of.  Ugh.  I see a dietician on the 26th...fun times.  In the mean time, I have been eating on a normal person's schedule and walking at lunch time. Yesterday and today both I took a long walk at lunch time. Something I wouldn't do alone so thankfully had two different friends who were around who said "sure" when I suggested a walk.    Hmmm...not much else, really. Right now, I am thinking of leaving to go home and get ready for spring break. I have to wash t-shirts and sleeping bags.  I also have to finish cleaning my house.  The entire thing.  I am trying to make it so that when I am gone it can then stay neat. If I get back and it's a mess, then, I will know that I am not the cause of our disastorous house. And that is what it is, a disaster.  Of course, instead of sitting on my lazy butt, I should have gone to pre-school today to observe/interview. Lazy butt. At least, though, I have gotten a lot done today.  More than I planned.  :-)  I remembered important things, even.   When I get home, I have to check my mail.  I have to make sure I don't have over-due bills. ARGH.  I am bad at that bill paying business lately. When I live somewhere more permanant, I will have a regular place for bills.  Honestly, I feel like I life in temporary housing all the damn time. I can't settle where I am and don't know where I am going to end up so I can't get excited... I WANT MY GRAD SCHOOL DECISION LETTER...ARGH.  So, hum, what else can I do today to work?  I don't want to do anything, really. I am in the mood for a week off.  ha ha ha...I get a pretend week off for spring break--taking the student to play but it's a group I don't know and a bunch of stuff I don't like doing...outdoor labor...lazy me.  Ack.

      I spent a week in the woods and it was fun. The group of students was amazing and I was glad not to have to play MOMMY or POLICE the entire week.  Thankfully.  The work was hard and challenging but physically challenging not mentally. That was a good thing.  I got into my graduate program. Harvard here I come, baby.  It's sinking in gradually but I am still not making a huge deal. Other people are, though, and it's funny.  Nice, though.  My job as 16 applicants as of right now. That's a lot and I am sure there are more.  Wow...what a search.  Some of the people are stupid, though.  Many levels of stupid.  I am getting excited about losing weight. Yippee!  I go to the dietician on Friday so that should be fun.

      We're watching  Gothika  right now while we're cooking.  Renee is making chili for dinner with tofu and kidney beans. I'm making lentils for various concoctions that I am making this week.  My dietician gave me several good calls about what to do so I can lose weight.  Apparently Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is much like diabetes in that I have high levels of insulin and have to thus lower my carbohydrate intake.  I have good stuff, now, good ideas... HOPEfully, the weight will start coming off and I will get motivated by that and well, we'll see what happens.  I am beginning to become more and more excited about living somewhere different. It's difficult that I will be so far from home, that makes me kind of sad, actually. I will visit, though, and my family will definitely visit me because it will be a fun place to come with the kids, etc. Of course, the kids aren't that young anymore... Everybody gets old.  So far the movie is pretty good.  Renee made me watch  Duplex  last night and I kind of thought it was stupid. She said it was VERY funny and she "laughed her ass off" so with that build up, I was psyched...Drew Barrymore...can't go wrong, right?  Nope.  It was okay, I guess. I am just glad I didn't see it in the theater.  Renee's good with dinner tonight. I am taking my time with the laundry I have in...Oh, the lentils needed draining and the laundry switching...  Okay, going to go back to the movie now, I think. Everything on the stove is there for the long haul.

      Haven't posted in April yet.    Happy April.  I am taking a trip next week.  Well, this Thursday through next Friday, really.  I am leaving to go home for the weekend for Easter. Then, on Monday there is an admitted student event at Harvard.  Mommy and Daddy are coming to that with me. Then, on Tuesday, they're dropping me off at the hotel for the conference that is on Thursday and Friday.  I will essentially have two days in a hotel to relax and get work done.  I love hotels.  Sure, I will miss my cats but I love hotels.  I get to go home and spend Thursday evening, Friday, Saturday, and part of Sunday at home with the extended and immediate family.  Then, on Sunday night, my parents and I leave to drive to Albany where we'll stay at the hotel.  Then, Monday we'll drive out towards Cambridge, probably to the hotel and leave the car at the subway station lot or drive to the hotel and have them take us in the shuttle so it's free...then we'll either walk around Boston or Cambridge or both, depending on time, before the event at 4pm.  Afterwards, we'll go to dinner (probably), or back to the hotel...or both--dinner at a place near the hotel.    Then, on Tuesday we'll get up and have breakfast at the hotel, drive out towards Worcester, and my parents will drop me off at the hotel there. I will hang out and relax/exercise/read until everybody comes on Wednesday night. Thursday and Friday are the conference days.  The pre-conference workshops are on Thursday and I present on Friday.  Oh, that reminds me. I have to write what I am going to say.  That'll be fun.  Actually, it will.  I also have to apply for some scholarships that will help me with my college expenses. I have a great financial aid package but it doesn't cover living there...ugh...it just covers (well, not "just" b/c it is a GREAT package) tuition, the health fees, and books.  I am excited.  Books!!!!!!!!!!  The health fee covers Harvard's campus services and a health insurance (BC/BS) plan, too. It'll be just like having a job. Part of me thinks I will need to get a job, too.  A part-time job...ugh...and full-time student status...I also have to get a work-study job...I am eligible! I want to do Jumpstart.  :-)  As soon as I have my address there, I will submit an online JS application!  I don't particularly want to be a team leader, just a Corps member.  :-)  I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then I can do the PTF!  Oh, the joy never ceases.  It's only 3:45.  I want to go home now. I think I will go grocery shopping on the way home. I have to pick up a prescription at Wal*Mart.  Oh, I can leave before 5 b/c I have to pick something up at the campus health center, too.  On May 4th when I have my doctor's appointment so she can see how much weight I have lost (I haven't a clue, actually, even though I bought the scale from Renee...I need to start weighing myself once a week) and how I am doing...anyway, when I go to the doctor's office, I will give her the form to complete that she has to mail to the HUHS.    Okay, back to work.  More after I get back, or while I am gone if the chance presents itself.  Right now, I am going to write a "to do" list and start checking things off of the one I have already.  I want REAL SPRING WEATHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I am hungry.  There's a gay dinner tonight that I am going to at 7pm so I will eat then.  Ugh...can't wait...must eat...drinking water....  Go and support the students.  Blah.  It's the thing to do...  My biggest concern is that you-know-who and her new squeeze will arrive and be all cutesy...  I will gag.  Truly.  No lie.  It will make my head spin and all that.  Of course I will be civil to their faces and in public...but in times like this, it makes me wish my roommate were not so grumpy at night.  The support will come from nowhere.  I have to move. I hate moving but what I hate more is packing up and preparing to move.  I need to get all kinds of SHIT thrown away and given away and just away.  There is no reason for a person my age to own so much stuff. STUFF. I have clothing, furniture, and STUFF.  I have more stickers than most stores. I have stationary items to write ten letters a week for the rest of my life (maybe). I have candles that would light the entire Titanic.  I have more books than some school libraries and I have more movies and CDs than some school libraries.  I don't have A LOT but I have a lot.    My biggest task right now is getting thigns cleaned up. Of course, I am NEVER home to do these things.  Then, I get frustrated.  This weekend, for example. I have yet another out of town engagement--the third in as many weekends.  I will be in PA for my godson's first communion. Great time, good to see family, etc. but the timing sucks.  Oh well.  Next weekend is the end of the year celebration for my programs where the kids and their families come...goodie.  Then on the following weekend...oh, wait...am I free?  Oh, nope...Mother's Day...gonna go home.  Then it is Commencement and I am booked up on both days. I have been asked to be the student marshal--i.e. lead the WS students in the procession.  I am honored and very excited.  THEN after that I might be free...hmmm...  Finding a place to live without being there is crappy.  I am working a lot online and have a few leads but they're so scary for me as it's online...UGH...this is driving me batty.  Oh, now I am preoccupied with what if you-know-who and her new squeeze show up.  UGH...shoot me.  I will arrive late so I can have some breathing time and not have to sit there and wallow.  :-)    My boss is making the initial contact with those who he's doing phone/preliminary interviews with.  It's scary to have my job going bye-bye.  HOPEfully we'll get somebody in who the students will love as much as they've loved me.  I'm not being cheesy there, they are getting anxious about me leaving.  They've said, many of them.  It's touching, really.  I'll be a basket case all during their last days and my own.  I don't expect good-bye "stuff" but anticipate there will be something, albeit small.  I know, whoops, that one of my JS teams is doing something b/c I happened across the TLs agenda for her meeting the night before and on it was "Jenna's good-bye present/party" which made me pause.  It is real.  Having an official role in Commencement will really make me...nostalgic.  It'll be the 9th one or so that I have gone to and hopefully not the last. I love Commencement.  I might travel up from Harvard for next year's.  B's wedding is the weekend or two after so I will be up her way in mid-May...see!!!! The travels for next year have already begun rearing their heads!  Sheesh.  The JDS always does something little for those who are leaving after however many years and that will be weird... It'll be shortly before I leave, or in late May. I don't know.  They'll plan it so those of us who are leaving can attend.  It's usually a nice time and I hope to be thin by then.  Hell, I hope to be thinner by Commencement...  I am trying...the exercise piece is killing me b/c I don't do it.  I LOVE walking so should just bring my sneakers to work and do it for an hour or so every single day.  I could also walk when I get home at night b/c it's still light out.  I wish my beloved roommie would walk with me. She is truly a party pooper.  UGH...20 minutes until my gay dinner. I don't wanna go...I'm going late and my boss is going to his meeting early so that way, I won't walk in alone.  I will hang out with random people and PRAY that if you know who and her new squeeze are there that they aren't overly obnoxious...and that I don't get stupid and look like a deer in headlights. I can be stupid sometimes...albeit, I can definitely be suave most of the time.  This is one of those times where I will kick myself if I do/say anything stupid or goofy.  Practice it in my head...gear myself up...so when they're NOT there, I will be almost disappointed.  :-)  I wonder which of the people I have come to know on paper will become my replacement.  It'll be neat to see.  I will leave my number as a resource for them and will hopefully get a call every now and then.  Speaking of calls...I should go and look at apartments so I can write down information for calls/e-mails.  What a process.  I'll definitely post soon to let you know how the gay dinner went and if you know who and her new squeeze were there or not... and if they were...how stupidly I did NOT act.

      Well, lots to write...I suddenly don't feel like writing, though.  I am hungry and should eat. Blah.  I need to go grocery shopping but shouldn't do that hungry so that leaves me...where?  Sitting here, of course.  I am sick of being w/o a girlfriend.  It's stupid, though, because I am moving soon so what would the point to that be? Having somebody to leave?  Ha.  I am tired all the time and realize it's probably partially due to the fact that I have been drinking pepsi... way to keep myself up at all hours of the night.  Not again.  Work is busy but I am leaving soon. I can't believe it.  I have been at this job so long and at this school so long...wow...this hits me every so often.  Well, this is pointless. Not making me feel better, only feeble b/c I am hungry.  Maybe more later--if I can find the time.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  ha ha.

      I need to vent for 3 seconds...  or 3 minutes   My dad is not helpful with issues that he could be helpful with when he gets the slightest hint it might be related to anything gay. EVEN IF IT IS NOT.  Now I know where I get my paranoia from. Or whatever it's called.  Fake intuition?   The issue I have is one that I would love to blog about so people could e-mail me from all over the world telling me that I am right. BUT alas, it's a friendly site that ppl I know might read and thus, I would look bad in the eyes of peers.  Even though I am right.  Okay. I feel better-ish now.  Time to go figure out how I will find thousands of dollars to pay for sixteen different apartments at once.    It must be nice to quite one's job and live off of one's tax return while running home to mommy and daddy.  I wouldn't know.     AND YES, I realize that saying this will probably mean it'll come back someday and bite me in the ass.  That is a risk I am willing to take.

      I need to find a place to live.  There are many, many great places but my finances are just about non-existent. Sometimes, I wonder what I was thinking choosing to go to an expensive city.  Hopefully it's all going to come together.  I just feel rushed even though I don't have to move until August/September.  Ugh.  On Thursday, I had a surprise party thrown by my students. I was so happy. Many people came and it was touching.  Ave made a speech and cried. Lisa came and brought her girls. So many students were there. Hugs were given all around. I didn't cry b/c I didn't read the cards until I got home...it's all sinking in slowly.  I can't believe 7 years are coming to an end... Oh, and I got a chair. One of the captain's chairs with the WS seal on it. I have always wanted one of those. I am just so touched and moved by how many people are reaching out to say good bye/show appreciation...etc.  I mean, I am not surprised but am, in a way...    The candidates...  OH MY GOD! How funny...the cheerleading championships are on TV.  I can only think of "Bring it On" and laugh. Um, the caption just said, "more all girl cheer...next."  Oh, captivating.  Um, oh yeah... The candidates for my job started coming yesterday. There are four more in a row MondayTuesdayWednesdayThursday...  I get breakfast with them each day. It's weird to interview my replacement. I want to just stay. I have started to just get sick of looking for a place I can afford to live that I just want to stay here, learn to fly a helicopter, and fly myself to school everyday at Harvard.  OH MY GOD again...."chix filet" is the sponsor of this competition... sickening.  "chix"  Anyway, busy weeks coming up...so much to do to close out the year and get everything ready for the replacement. I hope they don't come into a hostile take over or whatever. I am also, of course, worried that the students will like the new person better than me and forget about me.  Yes, I know, I am nuts.  Um, yeah...I am in a mood today. R's home for m's day and so I have been cleaning up and doing laundry. I have also been sneezing and feeling like I am going to puke. Right now, I am ready to figure out what to eat...but worry about my stomach.  Ugh.  Oh, and getting fat...I could get fat if I am not careful.  Figures, this cheerleading business is on FOX.   Maya insists on sleeping on my stomach. She's making me sneeze. Poor cat.  I am excited about our trip to Yellowstone this summer. I want to pack today--I have enough clothing that I could probably leae things packed for 2 months and not miss them.  I won't, though, because I have to seriously get rid of clothing. There is no reason for me to have as much as I do. I have four bags ready to go to goodwill or wherever. I should probably cut my clothing in half.   OHMYGOD...little children cheering...um, wow.  It wasn't in the competition. I wish the commentators would SHUT UP so we can hear the music. That's what I like best.  Yeah, right!!!!  ;-)  No, seriously, I do want to hear the music. Stupid commentators.  I got a friend's engagement announcement in the mail on Friday.  They're getting married in Key West, FL next May. Guess if I want to go...I have to start saving money now.  I didn't realize they were choosing that...I thought they were going to get married in NJ where they live. She said on the beach at sunset but I didn't think of the logistics of "which beach" near NYC they'd choose...I guess I should have thought about it more...or asked her...the last time we talked on IM.  Anyway, I want to go so I guess I have to save my money and work on that weight loss.    Um, there's nothing else to say, I don't think.    Southern Methodist University...cheerleading--isn't that irreligious?  I mean, they're showing SKIN and dancing around like jezebels...scandelous!  Wow, they have a maximum number of men for "small co-ed schools."  I wonder what other gems I can pick up.  Maybe I will start writing my novel today.  Oh, first I need to get my computer fixed. Figures.  Maybe if I sneeze on her enough, Maya will move.  Uh oh...she just woke up, looked at me, and meowed...one of her little cute meows..."love me" she says.  I love TLC. It's my favorite channel and I have to make sure that when I move, I don't have cable or I stay at school to work. I am afraid that I will become a slacker.  No, I won't pay all that money and go into all that debt and slack.  NO WAY.  I need an apartment.  Off I to go search.

      Yay new baby!  I want to go and visit but money prevents me from just up and leaving. Booo.  but...  YAY NEW BABY!    Two friends getting married and I anticipate a 3rd is soon to announce her engagement...I just have a gut instinct that the question will be popped on her birthday.  Another friend is jobless and soon to be homeless.  Whoops.  I need somewhere to live and need to figure out where to live...oh, and when to move...  More immediately, though, I need to figure out where I am going to sleep tonight!  I threw all my crap up onto my bed this morning when I started cleaning and now, it's late and I didn't finish like I said I would.  I got wrapped up playing the game Renee got me for Christmas (for the first time, whoops) and then watching Pieces of April--which I highly recommend---and then the mini-series on NBC about the 10.5 earthquake...  and now the 11 pm news.    And then, well, after I figure out where to sleep, I have to get up and go to work anyway. Boo. There's a dinner tomorrow night.  It's okay but I just want to get home and clean.   I don't know what to do about Mother's Day. I should go home but think I'll go for the day on Sunday. Show up and surprise everybody at the party...  I want to loose a bunch of weight before my 10th high school reunion.  That's not the only goal but it's the most distant. And after looking at my last day of high school and prom pictures...I didn't remember being so cute and thin.  Can't BELIEVE that I thought I was fat then!  UGH.  okay, tired...need to adjust the couch for sleeping....it's 4 ft and I'm 6...wonder how that'll work!?!?  It's my own fault. Sheesh.

      Well, it's just about 8:30 and I have arrived at work on time only to realize that I have a 1/2 hour before a meeting and then afterwards, will spend some of the rest of the day delivering clothing to various places in town. There aren't as many bags as we've had in the past, which is good.  But, still. It's not one of my favorite parts of the job. I need to write recommendations for how to get it done sooner--i.e. when the STUDENTS are here to do it. Frustration.  It's not going to kill me, really. I just complain too much, I think.  Tonight I am doing a presentation at a daycare center for an hour and then will sit with Ave's boys for about an hour and a half or so. I'm tired already so hopefully the day won't be too, too long. Perhaps I should take this hint and EXERCISE more--um, at all.  I need to get a place to live. I want to go next weekend but can't find anybody to go with me. My mom was going to go but now needs to get ready for a party the following weekend. I guess I could wait until the 12th of June but in case I don't find anything this time, I want to have future dates available. Of course, the other thing about going out there next weekend is I will need a place to stay. I have two friends in the area so will ask them, of course. I just prefer my own space--i.e. hotels. Money is required for trips and I can just about swing the two tanks of gas that will take me there and back... oh and the subway fares. HOPEfully I can find a place to crash and a friend to accompany me on my visits--for nothing else but safety, really.  Man, I am tired. I should get more sleep and eat healthier. When I was eating right on the diet, I was so good about sleeping regular hours, etc. BUT, now that I have gone back to my ridiculous ways...sleep suffers. I truly need to get my butt back in gear with the diet. I had done so well! 15 lbs and I think I have just about gained it all back. Figures...I think I have an unconscious self-sabotaging gene or drive...something. My will power is practically non-existe(a)nt.  I can't spell...forgive me.  I want a new e-mail address and my harvard course catalogue...I can't wait to start school! I'm pretty excited.  Oh! I just thought of something to take up my 20 minutes until the interview thingy I have at 9 am.  I'll do my job application for the Federal work study job I want to get.

      Well, well, this new format for Blogger is pretty spiffy.    I might play around and change my profile and settings, etc. Of course, that might erase everything I have posted...all 125 of them. The original blog I created only has 25 b/c when I tried to change the background, it erased it...or something. I don't remember, really.  Anyway, I am trying to find a place to live in Beantown.  Trying. I want what I can't afford, I fear.  Living with strangers is scary but if I have to do it for a year, I'll manage. I just need to find cat lovers who won't make me nervous... I've actually e-mailed back and forth with two guys.  Imagine that! Me, living with a boy!   I'm psyched about graduate school. Have I said that recently? Probably not because I have been preoccupied with how I can't afford anything. Literally. Anyway, yeah, I am excited about starting new things and meeting new people and needing to buy books and read them and talk about them and do projects and papers...um, whoa there, buddy...papers? I don't know about that one.    Someday soon, I need to get all the stuff that I need to sell out from the various boxes and closets that house it and set them FREEEEEEE...for a price. I want to sell my large TV but Renee reminded me that I mightn't be able to hook up a DVD player to an older TV. Well, that's okay b/c I don't have a DVD player and I don't want one if it means having to keep a huge TV... I really want to make a few hundred bucks at a yard sale. I need to figure out WHAT and how much I can sell to people... I can't part with books or CD's but, well, we'll see! Maybe I'll have to. Ugh.   I'm doing a training on Thursday and will get $100 for it. It's coming at a good time. Phew. Yeah, I am really strapped for um, cash...coins...just about any form of MONEY. Renee said that I should get an evening job...Yeah, but I think I value my sanity and freedom more than my ability to live in Beantown on no income.  Then, what about the month of August for a job? Um, again...sanity!?!??!  It'll all work out.  Whoa, darkness sets in quickly!  Maybe we'll get an impressive storm!  Fun times...NO MORE POWER OUTAGES ON CAMPUS!! Noooooo!!!!!!! Of course, I could work from home...  You know, I was thinking yesterday that there is NO reason that I can't work from somewhere else and HAVE to sit in this office each day. I have so much stuff that I need to do on the computer and really, until it's time to pack up ... why can't I just move to Beantown now??!?!?!  I'm excited about my family trip to Wyoming and back this summer, though.  I want to live somewhere longer than ONE YEAR or 9 months...seriously.  Um, okay... I could start writing and selling my novels. I could sell my afghans. I could take up the oboe again and join an orchestra. I could sell something art and crafty. It'll be fabulous..... I can see it now!    Well, time to get back to work!  Until next time...

      I have a job. Thankfully I don't have to really get frantic about how I am going to pay for everything once school starts. I'll be back on the good ole' school payroll again in September for a job working with the Boston internship program.  It's actually a DREAM job. Exciting.  I'm going out to MA this weekend to look at apartments and meet potential roommates, etc.  CROSS YOUR FINGERS that I find something reasonable and safe.  Um, tired...good night!

      Well, it looks like I might get to meet the baby sooner than we thought! They're coming home in June, possibly the beginning of the month.  Of course, that still requires travel out to NYC. At least that's cheaper/closer than Minnesota!   First, though, I need to get to MA to look at places to LIVE for my big move. That's kind of overwhelming me so I tend to not think about it. Is that bad?  Probably. No, I look at the web sites everyday and until I know FOR SURE when I can actually get out to MA, I don't want to get too excited. I will probably want my own studio so will call one or two of the real estate places. I could tolerate a place that was 5-10 minutes walking to school or a Red Line T stop. I could tolerate a place that was 5 minutes from a bus stop that goes directly to Harvard Square... I don't want to commute too, too much for a few reasons...my anxiety about public transportation...winter weather...safety at night...laziness (i.e. my inability to leave my house on time for ANYTHING)...  I haven't talked about the kitten that visited my office a few weeks ago!  One of my students had a kitten and she brought him around with her all over campus. For two days, she left him with us during the day at work! He slept on my desk near the kleenex box, curled up in a little orange ball. So adorable. He learned to hang up my phone and did it twice while I was talking! Once during a conference call and once during a check-in. Thankfully, during the check-in, I was in mid-sentence so she knew something had happened but during the conference call, they thought I was there and talked to me and then I called back in and had to say I had hung up the phone accidentally.  Whoops.  Thinking about moving, again... I have to have a yard sale. There are many things that aren't even sentimental that I have and so can just get rid of...to make money and to save space. Some of my stuff *will* have to go home to my parents b/c I won't have room anymore. The bears and the (broken) bear cabinet need to be put somewhere safe/dry and some of my sentimental things (pictures, the t-shirts for the quilt I WILL make someday, etc.) will have to go home, too. I will take books, music, clothing, bedding, movies (bad idea but will do it anyway), and the cats and their stuff. Pretty much, that's it. Oh, and the furniture that will fit wherever I end up. Of course, w/o a couch, I am tempted to get a futon for a studio apartment so I can have a couch and a bed then my two chairs and the rest of my bedroom set, just not the bed until I have a house/apartment big enough for it (not that it's huge).  Okay, enough rambling. Back to my work at hand...whatever that is today...

      Haven't posted in June!  Can't believe it...   The apartment hunt is still going on. Surprising?  No, not really.  This time, though, I will NOT leave w/o signing papers, writing a check, and impressing future roommates into loving me. :-)  NOT that I think the other potential roommates didn't love me...I just think it didn't work out for whatever other reasons. Those places were not meant to be.  My brother is leaving for Europe today! I am so excited for him because by his age (oh, the ripe old age of 20) I had been to many, many places.    I am glad to get away this weekend but will miss Renee. At least I will be back before our brunch with our married friends on Sunday. Well, two are married and two are engaged. I am glad, though, to get the chance to see them before leaving. I bet this will be the last time I see them before I move to MA. Wow.  Work is work.  No replacement yet. Surprising? Again, no.  Nadia and her baby are home in NYC. I wish I could visit. That's gotta be so weird... having a baby.  Okay, back to work.

      Renee is in DC. I am glad she got off to a good start with her first time flying.  We got to the airport early...left at 4:40 AM. I slept when I got home instead of going out like I had planned. I fell asleep at 7:30 and woke up at 2:30 so now, I have had a full night's sleep. I feel good, actually.  Actually, my plans for today didn't involve sleeping so much but, I guess that's good. I really want to go see MM's new film. Michael Moore, that is. We're on an "initials only" basis. Yeah, right.  Maybe I will do that later tonight...it's in Syracuse, Rachacha, and Ithaca...not around here, really.  Hmmm...I just did a new yard sale poster and like Renee's better. Oh well. We'll figure it out. Mine has little things at the bottom to tear off. Hers is good for hanging around here or nearby where people know where our building is.  Britney Spears is engaged again. Sigh. Pop-culture.  Hey! A man on TV said "boughten" and it made me laugh.  Whoops...it's late. I have to do something. Anything...um...yeah...

      Well, everybody, I have a place to live. No thanks to the people who didn't call me back. I am sorry, but some level of civility must have been lost there. Certainly I am not so bad that you can't even call me or e-mail to say "We went with somebody else." Or "We aren't letting the room after all."  Or "I don't think things would work out."    Anyway, I have a studio about a block up from Davis Square in Somerville. VERY exciting. No worrying about living with weird people. Although, I have learned that people you meet who seem sane and kind of sweet might actually be weird, rude, or something else. Go figure.  So, I will get to furnish a cute studio. A friend of mine looked at it for me and approved it.  So, that night, I called the landlord and took the place. Mailed the check and sent the application the next day. We'll sign the lease in July and I will move in August. Perfection.  I might even get to store my boxes in the basement until I move in.  That is good news.  Makes me feel better.  On a different note, Renee is flying for the first time tomorrow morning. I get to leave here to take her to the airport at 4:30 a.m. Figure, all the times she's done similar things for me...I owe her, big.  So, she'll be in DC this weekend. I get to prepare myself for the yard sale next weekend. She's insisting on having it here instead of on a busy street. We'll see...maybe I will be proven wrong. We can only hope.  Um...OH yeah! I got my chair today! I am very, very, very excited. I left it in the car, though, in the box. I am not sure where it'll fit in the house and I am not unpacking it until I move. Very exciting.  !! I am watching  While You Were Out  and the host, Evan, took a chunk of his finger off on a saw and had to go to the ER so Lesley is taking over as host. How funny! I just love when things go wrong or whatever. It's funny.

      I want a place to live. Is that too much to ask? I am beginning to take it personally.  Maybe I should wonder if people are reading this somehow and deciding they don't want to live with me. I am perfectly sane. Sheesh.  Well, keep your fingers crossed, dear readers.  I just want a nice, safe, fun place to live that is inexpensive and close to school.  That's all I ask. I was out there again this weekend and really will start taking this personally if I don't hear back. I mean, at least tell me the status of your decision making process or have the ability to call and say "no, because..."  Argh.  Other than that...I can't think...focus...it's getting me nervous and that's not fun.

      Tomorrow is July. With that comes my birthday. Exciting.  Today I managed to get most of what I wanted to do accomplished. I packed winter clothing and my videos to send home on Friday with my family. I packed some of my books. The boxes in my closet were opened and sealed back up to send home. I have done 3 loads of laundry so I can pack for our trip and put all the clothes I won't wear before I move into bins/bags. I made an appt for the vet next Thursday and confirmed a U-Haul for next Friday. I ate lunch.   There is more, yes, but at least now, now I can sit here ant not feel guilty. There are boxes in the front room that need sorting and well, that'll come with time. None of it is to sell, thankfully.  The yard sale pile is set, I think. Mine at least. There is more than I thought. I hope we have good luck.  Tomorrow I work and we have a party. Friday the family comes and then after that, I will price stuff. Maybe after I babysit tonight I will price stuff to start with.  Ugh. THANK goodness. The stupid show is over on TLC...that wedding story business makes me gag sometimes. SOME of them are neat but some are gag-worthy. I missed a make over story. Um, baby?  Nope. I think I will change the channel or...go upstairs and sort. I don't particularly feel like sorting anything else. BUT, alas, 'tis life.

      I bought laundry detergent today so I can do laundry. When I got home, I realized that we also need dish washer detergent. Oh well. I guess that means one of our dirty piles will get reduced. As I said in an e-mail, I suppose I could do the dishes in the sink. Ugh.  Lately, I have experienced rejection more than I am used to. Not only have people not accepted me to live with them but now, I have not been accepted to be a pet-sitter. I think it's because I live a bit far away for their liking. Oh well. There goes $200. That, adn the dogs were sweet.  That's okay.   My birthday is on Thursday. It's weird to think about that. Just another day, I guess. Ave is having a party for me with some of our students and Renee. My parents can't come. They might come the next day, though. I hope.  I want to have a good weekend...considering we have the confounded yard-sale. Ugh. NOT that I am not looking forward to trying to make some money but, yeah.  Well, I guess I can go back to work. The cats are in the windows... except for the poor girl who was brutally attacked by her brother before I left the house. God help us.   I can't believe I am moving AGAIN. UGH. That's once a year for 3 years... and college before that! ALL the time...move a year.  The yard sale might be exciting. I just have to consider selling CDs like Renee is. She's making money but, well, I am attached to material possessions. That's one of the many ways she and I are different.  Okay, it's only 2pm. I was awake just about now yesterday. That means I am already ahead of the game, or something like that. I have to sort clothing, do laundry, and clean the kitchen. My goal is probably too much but I want to have all the stuff I am selling set aside as well as put together a load of stuff for my parents to take if they come up on Friday.  TLC has reruns on that even I have seen now. Time to change the channel.

      Yard sale complete.  Packing commenced.  Moving date approaches--2 full days left and on the 3rd, the truck.  Lease signing and first viewing of apartment on Saturday. Yes, another trip out there.   Things are going nicely.  Lunch tomorrow with the...well, sort of ex.  Should be interesting.

      Well, let's see... I feel drugged! I don't know why...could be the humidity and heat that have been oppressive all day long. Or, could be the lovely dinner I put together tonight. Stuffing and candy. No lie.  I feel bad right now. Renee is going to be here two weeks longer than I am so she will get stuck cleaning all the crap we're supposed to do for the apartment folks. I can't get over it! Sure, they want a clean place but I know for a FACT that they hire a professional cleaner anyway so what the heck. We keep it in good shape...ugh.  Anyway...  I don't really...well, I am watching TV so...again, get distracted. I just wish Bianca and her friend (can't remember her name) would kiss. Call me crazy.  Crazy.  I have a headache. Perhaps sleeping on the floor will help. Oh, wait. NOT REALLY.  Oh well. I slept in Renee's bed last night because she was not around. It was nice to have a bed. Mine is, well, out to the curb in my parents' yard. The frame is in their garage. I am trying to figure out a futon that is comfortable and inexpensive. I wouldn't mind  putting it together, either. SO, we shall see what I am going to sleep on. :-)  What the heck is that girl's name?  It's driving me crazy. They could have at least said it by now on the show. Sheesh. 10 minutes to go and they probably won't say it.  Maggie? I don't remember.  Well, Renee is off to bed. Tomorrow is the last time I get to spend with her before I move. Guess we won't really get to have much time before I move. I anticipate the day will be spent much like this one. I get home, she's on the phone for 2 hours and then comes down for two hours before going to bed. I understand. It's just that we've been so close for so long...Either she's bad at saying good bye or she doesn't care. Can't tell.  Anyway...guess I could figure out how to clean. Considering I don't have anything to distract me but the internet and that gives me a headache.

      Ch Ch Ch Changes  My stuff is at my parents' house, in the garage. I have a very small bit left here. It's sad, really.   Friday, after the truck was loaded up by my parents and brother, my dad and I drove to MA. Saturday, I signed my lease for the new apartment. My apartment is cute!  Yesterday, Daddy drove the truck back to their house. I slept on the living room floor. It was strange.  Today, I cleaned out my room and closed the door. No more.  That's the short version.  The thing that's the weirdest about all this is Renee. I will miss her so much. I can't really get over that.  She's at home now b/c she needs to go to a funeral tomorrow morning. A friend from high school died in a car accident the other day. Wow. I can't get over it.  Right now, I am distracted b/c it's a behind the scenes show of  Trading Spaces  which I have been waiting for. Ugh. Anyway, I was planning on writing more so maybe later after this show.
