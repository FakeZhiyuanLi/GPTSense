      i'm going to be sending out my cd on monday. you guys better like this cd because i've had to spend about 30 bucks just to get cd's and cases, print the sleeves and buy the envolopes and stamps to mail this stuff out. crazy.  anyway, what's asher's address? i have everyone else's but his so if he's going to get a cd, i need his address.

      I'm here in Nashville with Dave *(this is Asher writing).  We agree that, regardless of burner accessibility, coordination, and/or speech impairment, tardiness on CDs is unacceptable.   If you got flat feet, you can't be in the army.  (Or a wooden eye, says Dave......) ?  Also, Dave has chronic body odor.  This is a great quote i just heard...  "It's nothing personal.  It's just music." -D.M. Woodall, 2003, in conversation (referring to his own brother's dilinquency)

      I'm voting that Mike Woodall be put on Afterburners probation.  I know this sounds rediculous, and it has never been done before but if I end up taking another turn(I was the first person to go) before he ever puts out a mix then I vote he be put "on hold".  That means he will not be recieving anymore cd's untill he puts out.  So let's say that if your late a third month then you get probation, that's more than fair.  He's missed one month and is most likely NOT going to make it for Dec. 1st(Matt, that's you) so he's got untill New Years to produce or he's cut off. Now, of course, I'll need a majority vote on this issue...so....Yay or Nay? Sorry I've gotta come down hard like this but that last email was my breaking point.

      When a family member is put on probation, only a family member can choose if the delinquent family member is to remain on probabtion or be "subsituted" by another equal or more compatable family member.  (Since it is only fair that it will be the active family member who has to impart the ruling of dissmissal to the deliquent party.) 000000000000000000000section C/09er  My subsitution will be the admission of the first female in the club: Esther Bumbier (to go  9/1/04) 699 Ponce De Leon Apt. 319 Atlanta, GA 30308

      yeah, scott. i'd say you nailed it with #4. in my opinion, that was one of the disc's strengths - it offered some work from a few bands/artists that I've been meaning to check out but haven't been motivated enough to (i.e. - jurassic 5, ryan adams). so thanks to this disc, i've been more appropriately introduced to said acts. i think the J5 song is probably my favorite on the disc, which is unusual b/c i don't normally choose hip hop over rock, but in this case i do. it was better than anything else on the mix, at least of the stuff that was new to me. death cab and postal service still reign. i only had one real complaint about the mix. the whole time listening to it i was looking forward to hearing a coldplay song i'd never heard and then it turned out to be "help is around the corner", a tune which i have been quite familiar with for awhile now. still a great song, i had just got my hopes up for something different and then they were kind  of popped and flew around the room in loops and esses, leaving nothing but a wake of farting noises behind before dropping to the floor motionless and completely deflated. ok, that was a bit overdramatized. i'm just joe king. i am still having a hard time deciding if the mix is more nashville or chapel hill, though...i think the latter. speaking of the nash, i'm heading home for the holidays this week (tues-sun) to visit the old man and the rest of my kin.  i'll miss you all very...very much while i'm gone.  so, anyway, when i get back, i should be expecting no.7 already from matt bubar. am i right or am i right? yeah, i thought so. anyway, good job, asher. hey asher...one more thing. i was looking at your acrylic portraits, which are very good, i must say. but i came upon one that looked very familiar by the title, "Jessica". it looks just like a girl that went to my high school. it wouldn't happen to be a girl named Jessica Gallup, would it? just curious. she dated my best friend for a few months senior year. anyway, that would be weird if it was. it would be weird if it wasn't, too, cos it looks just like her. i know, guys. i'm abusing the afterburners team blog. veering off topic. sorry.

      1 - you immediately listen to the first track twice. 2 - you recognize a few songs that you love, and look forward to re-discovering 3 - you recognize bands that you like, but songs that you've never heard of 4 - you recognize bands that you've "been meaning to listen to" 5 - you don't recognize all of the bands on the list, all the while thinking that you were the authority on most independent music  most of you know that asher and i got off to a rocky start with him offering up ways to evangelize me (if you didn't know that now you do) - ha.  anyway, i was unsure how well we would recover from that situation, but now i realize that we have so much in common.    nice work asher.  are you going to DW's wedding?  if so i hope to chill with you and knock a few back and possibly have some good talks.  nice work on the ABCD!

      I just got Asher's cd in the mail today.  Nice Job Asher!  Although I do have 1 question:  track 17 you have listed as Richard Ashcroft, I've seen both The Verve and Richard(solo) live and that track sure does sound like The Verve.  It's really no big deal either way but I was just wondering if you knew for sure if it's just Richard.  I must say it's a good mix.

      Hey Scott, I(Ben) like The Gloaming!  Not MJ. And I would have to agree with MJ on the single issue.  There's no way I'd plunk down $8 for a song I already have, a remix of another song I already have and maybe one new song.  It's insulting to the fans.  I still have quite a few single from when The Verve (if they'd only get back together!) was making music and they are quality singles, with great b-sides.  You just dont see that much anymore.  Maybe that has something to do with Napster and Kazaa, because the last time I bought a single might have been before I discovered Napster.  Or maybe bands just stopped making quality singles because they knew fans would just download the stuff for free since it's only like 1 or 2 new songs?

      hmmmmm ... you guys are pretty hard on GTS.  i did not think it was all that bad of a choice, although i would agree that 2+2 should be a released single eventually.  mass appeal, etc ... i kind of like the song.  but something that MJ said:  he could not get away from the gloaming.  i feel the same way about backdrifters.  when thom comes into the song with the "ahh ahh ahh aaaaaaaaa"  it makes me want to scream and dance every time.

      You may actually be the last one to see things. I never saw it on MTV - MTV doesn't show music videos except during TRL, and I don't stay up late enough to see videos that aren't hip hop on MTV2 - but I do remember seeing this video somewhere at least a month or two ago. I think I found it posted on the internet somewhere...probably on Heavy.com. So, anyway, don't get excited about seeing this video get any attention. It's probably already missed its chance.  One other thing; I'd also like to add that I've never liked the single anyway (in general).  I think a band should only release a single if it's a non-album track that didn't fit on the album or something. The idea of me going and buying a disc for almost the same price as the album I bought, just for a song that I've already got on a full album and maybe two b-sides (one being a live recording and one being a demo recording of another song on the album) is ridiculous to me. I used to justify it when bands like Oasis and the Verve were actually putting quality b-sides on them that I could listen to. In fact, Oasis' "Whatever" single is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. That's what singles should be like. New song and three new b-sides (some call this an EP, but in the UK I guess it's still called a single). Everyone loved it. If bands would do that, I might actually buy singles. Even if one or two of the songs turn out to be mediocre, at least it's new and fresh to my ears. So to hell with singles!  I actually read somewhere that Thom Yorke said he's unsure if Radiohead will do the album thing anymore. He'd like to release only EPs from here on out, because putting together an album has put way too much pressure on them and become quite a daunting thing. Hmmm...

      Yes I would have to agree with the last couple of posts about Radiohead.  However, Am I the only person that thinks The Gloaming is an amazing song?  I'm not saying it should be a single or anything but damn!  I love the way the lyrics are done, repeating itself like that, and sonicly speaking it just lovely.  When that base-line comes in...it's like {in Neo's voice} Woooh.  It's hard for me to say it's my favorite song on the album but it's the only song that I just can't get away from.  Love the video although it kinda reminds me of a modern day version of that video from the 80's for "Money For Nothing".  Remember that?  "Money for nothin and yur chicks for free"

      I'd have to agree with Matt that "2+2=5" and "Where I End and You Begin" would've made better picks for a single, if only because they're more accessible songs that could appeal to more people. That's why I agree with that statement. And if I had to choose between the two, it would be  W.I.E.A.Y.B. . But I also feel that it's good when a band that has such great attention from the media releases something that doesn't fit into the mold that MTV and popular radio use to filter everything through. Radiohead have the ability to stretch the boundaries a little, and they're utilizing it - maybe paving the way for more bands with styles and sounds that don't have such broad appeal to see some success, too. Might not see it immediately, but...who knows. The video's pretty cool, technically speaking. The idea doesn't interest me all that much, but I thought it was executed really well. It's really amazing to see things like that done. It makes me feel pretty bad about myself, though, since I'm soooo not even close to being able to do stuff like that. Thanks again, Radiohead.

      i thought that the first single, "there there" was a good choice. as for "go to sleep", i would have picked almost any other song on httt other than that. but if i were to chose the next single, it would have either been "2+2=5" or "where i end and you begin".   on another topic, i have the go to sleep single and the import go to sleep single and i thought the b-sides on that were way better than the b-sides for there there.   oh and i thought the video was kick ass :)

          i have no MTV, no cable, and do not listen to the radio.  the person that turned me on to this suspected that i already knew about it, but i was amazed!  is this all over MTV and the radio yet?  does radiohead have another single in mainstream rotation?    go  urlLink here  and click on the radiohead story.  you might not see the almost hidden link at the side that says "to see the full video click here" you definately want to click that.  (don't read the story until you watch the video).  and please:  wait for work for the high speed access if need be.  let's get some posts going here at the afterburners blog.  topics:   radiohead mainstream singles:  good or bad? this choice for a single:  good or bad? the video:  kicks ass, or i suck ass so bad that i don't like it :-)

      So you all know, I saw Mike Woodall this past weekend and he said he's not ready to go for Jan. 1st so I'll be jumping him in line and he'll move to Feb. 1st.  So keep in mind, this will activate Mike's probation starting on new years.  If you still want to send him a cd that's up to you.  Once he sends a mix out he'll be off probation and free to recieve abcd's from everyone.  On a side note:  I had the opportunity to see Mike in green tights as he pretended to be Peter Pan.  It was quite a sight and it is sure to leave me  urlLink scarred  for life.  If I can find a picture it will no doubt be posted on this blog. peace

      Dave...I seem to remember somebody saying that they only wanted 1 CD a month, so they could fully absorb it. Am I remembering wrong??? Ben, on the other hand, shared the same feelings as I had about that issue. That's why he gets a bonus.  Too bad, dude. :(  Hey, I'm just kidding. But the amount of music I go through, I couldn't possibly afford to mail CDs out to everyone everytime I found something good. So let's all share. Perhaps you could try hitting up Ben and maybe he'd be kind enough to send you a copy.

      Yeah, drink lots of Pepsi...so that you can get ONE free mp3 download from the iTunes music store. Like, whoop-de-freaking-doo. I'm sick of these companies thinking we're all idiots and that we can't see right through these pitiful attempts at product promotion. As if I'm going to start buying cases of Pepsi so that I can win "100 Million Songs". There's a small chance I could win just one. Anyway, I just quit drinking soda. If I drink even a sip, I have to pay Matt Pamer $20.00. So I don't think there's a single free mp3 worth that, at least for me. Now, I must go. I must return to downloading my songs for free...later.

      It's not a rumor, actually. It's true. They developed their own language that they call "hopelandic" - some sort of fusion between English and Icelandic. I'm sure they didn't come up with an ENTIRE language. My guess is that they just took their songs, looked at the lyrical content of the songs in both Icelandic and English and kind of combined them and manipulated them however they wanted to get them to sound "just right" alongside their wonderful, wonderful music...and then, yes, probably sang the same lines multiple times on ( ). Anyway, whatever it is, it works really well and DOES end up sounding quite beautiful. Everything they've done astounds me. And to have made such gorgeous music at such a young age...it's pretty amazing. I hope you have all heard 2000's "Agaetis Byrjun", too.

      Yeah I noticed that too about ().  It sounds like they came up with a chorus line and then sang it over and over again, changing the music obviously.  But I also heard that they developed their own language/code that everything is sung in, it's english and it's not icelandic(isn't that were they're from?).  Has anyone else heard that rumor? That (album) is so good though, it doesn't matter what language it's in!

      i thought abcd 8 was pretty good. although i've heard a few of the songs already, the rest was new to me. andy zipf was in circadian rhythm, right? i also thought there was a good mixture of songs in it.  also, if anyone is interested. i stumbled upon this band today called  urlLink godspeed you! black emperor . these guys are like sigur-ros a little bit except some of they're songs are twice as long. but i think it's great. they have a lot of mp3 samples on their website. i'm not exactly sure, but i think it's all instrumental.   and while i'm talking about sigur-ros, is it just me or on the album - (), it sounds like he says the same thing over and over again on every song. either way it doesn't matter, i still like this album. just curious if anyone else thought that too.

      Just wondering if you all have gotten a chance to listen to ABCD#8.  What do you all think?  Likes? Dislikes?  In hind-sight, I have come to realize that there is quite a few radio-songs and/or MTV songs on the cd.  If that really is the case I had no idea.  I really do not listen to the radio and haven't seen a minute of MTV in the last year or so.  So I apolagize for any excess mainstream stuff, I didn't mean for that.  Hope you are enjoying it.

      I think his vocals sounds ALOT like The Violent Femmes' vocals.  Maybe that's why I dont mind it so much.  Maybe, secretly, I'm pretending it's The Violent Femmes' new album...that rocks! But I totally agree with you about OUT HUD.

      I can't figure it out. Everything around me is telling me to like the Rapture - that they're just, like, wicked awesome and can make you get up and shake yer arse around once or twice. And I do dig their music. It totally makes you wanna do that. Except I can't get past Luke Jenner's vocals, so I don't think I'll ever like them that much. Maybe I just have to keep listening and get used to it so it doesn't bother me. Does anybody else think his vocals are just, like, way way obnoxious? It's just caterwauling, in my opinion. If I could just get past it, then I might like the Rapture a lot. But for the time being, it just ain't happenin' for me. Sorry. And #1 on  urlLink Pitchfork's Best Albums of 2003 ??? I don't know about that one...     But I do know about Out Hud. Now that's music that will make you get out yo seat and shake it. And someone in the band thought it best to not ruin the songs by injecting wretched howling at the moon. Seriously, everybody needs Out Hud's "S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D."

      The last time we had a relative of Dave's in Afterburners we never got a mix from them EVER, so before we all agree to have Esther join our little cult let's make sure she has a computer and a cd burner, or at least 24/7 access to one.  That's all.  Other than that, I'm all for her joining!

      I'll agree to disagree with you about Sting.  Except for his new album, I dont like it all that much and the single is kinda gay but the album before that (Brand New Day)...that's a great album, i dont care what you say.  But whatever, your too cool for Sting.

      Man, I think I struck Ben in his soft spot. Anyway, about Sting...the Police were good. I would agree with you there. I have, in fact, owned a Police record (no longer have it, though). So, so much for that hasty judgement. Anyway, they did have some really great songs that I enjoy[ed]. But let me clarify what I was trying to say. Sting sucks  now , as a solo musician. There's no doubt about it. Did you not hear his latest single? It's horrible! What is he trying to do??? It sort of makes me wonder about all that "talent" he has. Hearing this crap he spews out now, I gotta believe maybe Sting owes a lot of credit to the other guys in the Police. I don't know. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he has  no  talent. It's just been steadily depleted over the years...a lot - a  whole  lot! It's that, or else he's totally surrendered it to those around him in the studio and production room. And where's the integrity in that?  I could not disagree with you more about Sting having "more talent in one finger than 1/2 the people in [my] iPod."

      What!  dude, I'm standing my ground on Sting!   He definitely does NOT suck!  Yeah maybe this last album isn't as good as his others but the guy is a world class musician and song writer.  How can you deny that?  Let me guess, you dont own a single album of his, do you?  I'll even count the Police, anyhting?  Ok, then you can't say shit about Sting.  Yeah so Sting might not be the "cool" or "hip" music act that he once was but he's still got more talent in one finger than half the people in your i-pod! C'mon, somebody get my back on this!

      Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sting, Bryan Adams, Seal, Shmeal - whatever...they all suck. Hey, I'm glad you had a good time, though. Really, I am. In fact, I'm jealous [chortle, choke]. Well, maybe, I'll get lucky and being able to at least see one of them live...on Oprah - Aw, snap!

      That might have been funny if I had just seen Sting in concert but since I saw Bryan Adams it's not!  Actually I've seen Sting in concert(a few years back) and it was great!  In fact, I'd go see him again!  Bryan Adams, on the other hand, was a New Year's Eve show that I was given free tickets to...so why wouldn't I have gone?  And leading up to the show I was making fun of it cuz he's kinda laim but I left the show saying "hey, he's pretty good live and I was familiar with just about evey song, that was fun".  I checked my musical pride/taste at the door and had a good time despite the performer. So SHUT UP JONES!!!!

      Dave send me an invite to your church clothes thing and call me about that stuff. I finally got #9, glorious. I like the outkast. Some of the rest of the stuff, I don't know. I guess everyone else in the club has like a girlfriend or something but I feel like a fag driving around downtown with buddies listening to whimpery sad stuff. I guess my musical tastes are a little more upbeat and when I do get down on like sad time music its usually like the white stripes or brmc. I don't get sad,  I get rocked out. It was nice to hear vaseline again though. It would also be cool to try and never have the same band as anyone else has had until we get into like the third year or something. I'm gonna end up being able to put together my afterburners cds and compile the entire streets, pearl jam, radiohead, and ryan adams albums.

      no no no no no! nobody's cuttin' ahead of me again. i'm tired of waiting. i'm up after josh and that's it. and to tell you all the truth, i really don't want to add anyone to the club anymore. i feel very strongly about that. i feel if we add anymore people, we're gonna lose our grip. i already can't stand waiting six months between mixes. i'm telling you. you guys are already missing out on so much from me. let's cut it off, alright?

      Dave, how many times do we need to send out addresses?  Let me guess, you lost them in the move.  Well, because we love you so much we'll go ahead and send them to you AGAIN....but dont go losing them this time.  Since Esther is joining the team officially(right?), we'll need to get all the needed info and decide where she'll be placed in line.  Does she just fall in at the end of the line?  Or, does she go right away, like after Dave?  What do you all think?

      i'm going through the emotions of the typical "former college athlete." you know how when they "were great" and they could excercise more than what a real life schedule allows them to do.  the reason AB was founded, was b/c i was loosing my musical edge w/ the ALLbusiness life. I've recruited the finest men i can find to help a brutha keep his edge. so don't be suprised if I don't contribute the same quality  magical mike,  sexy scott, brillian ben, magnificant matt, Juicy Josh, or Ashy ash bring to the round table.

      Scott, if you liked Sage Francis...here's some others you should check out: cLOUDDEAD, Aesop Rock, Why?, King Geedorah, DoseOne, Buck 65, Atmosphere - just to name a few. Trust me...it's not for everyone, but if you liked SF, then it might be worth your time to look into some of those names. I probably dig cLOUDDEAD and Why? the most out of those I listed. But most would think it's pretty weird. The others are more beat driven, where those two can drift into the abstract. Some more underground hip/hop that's good but hasn't had the "emo rap" tag slapped on it: any of MF Doom's incarnations (Madlib, especially though), Mr. Lif, El-P...hmm, that's all I can think of right now. Out of the mainstream stuff, I'm really liking Kanye West a lot, and anything that the Neptunes do is magic. It sounds like I'm a big rap listener, but I'm not. I just get in that mode every once and awhile, where some beats & rhymes is just what I need. This stuff's what I turn to to satisfy that craving.

      The same way you post pics on any blog site or website for that matter.  You need a host....A place to upload the images to.  Mike, maybe you could direct Dave to one of the many free image hosting sites on the web. Dave, Once the image is uploaded to the host you need to write the code that links it from the host to the website or blog entry in this case.  This( ) is a basic line of code for an image, only thing you would do is put the image's name between the quotes and remove the space between  Hey I'm a real novice at this so if someone else has a better solution for Dave that's great.

      I love that album.  But it took me alot longer to say that for "Human Condition", I dont know why, maybe I was expecting something different from him musicly, so I let it sit for a while.  I've since then rediscovered it's greatness.  That album is so spiritual and honest, it's not even funny!  It's a beautiful thing to hear a man cry out to God and even question him and himself.  I think it's been an exciting journey to watch so far.  That is, if you've been following him since The Verve days, he's a different man now for sure!  Although, every time he comes out with something new, part of me is wishing for a song like "The Rolling People" and those wild Nick McCabe guitar riffs. "Dear God, please let Richard and Nick get past their differences and reform The Verve, Amen".

I liked the Sting vs. Sean Paul performance last night too.  They played Roxanne the same way(w/o Sean Paul of course) when I saw him a few weeks ago, reggae style.  Very cool. 4.  Good mix Scott, sorry if it sounded like I was coming down on it.  Oh and I like that Streets song too.

      1 - ben:  did you ever think that maybe, just maybe, you were the first to get it, and thus should not ruin the suprise for everyone else? hmmmmm  1.5 - yeah, jack white blew the walls off the place.  i can't believe bb king (handing out the next award right after the performance) did not mention it.  1.75 - what about sting and sean pual?  i thought that was pretty dope - but maybe i'm the only dancehall regae fan in AB, that's understandable.  MIKE JONES STAY OUT OF THIS ONE ;-)  2 - gheeze matt, of course you can get it all for free.  i'm not sure how much of that i actually bought.  i just "discovered" it on itunes. like i discovered the exclusive ep's from siguor ros this week.  3 - there goes my TFlips history award.  i thought it was new.  are you sure it's the same songs / same EP? or is it old songs re-done.  have you seen cool hand luke? and why did i hear all of the buzz about plastic jesus recently (i think matt also told me about that track - which is one of the reasons i started listening to it. )  PS:  go and get the japanese version of "yoshimi battles the pink robots"  -it's mas bueno.  3.19 - bowtie.  whoops for some strange reason i thought "happy v-times day" was on ben's, and bowtie on mine but i got mixed up.  4 - was there anything you liked on ABCD nine ;-)

      Hey, did anyone else see Jack White blow it up last night at the Grammys?  I mean, he tore shit up on the guitar!!!  That was an amazing display of guitar geniusness.  They should have just given him an award for that performance alone.

      I'm pretty sure "She Dont Use Jelly" & "Plastic Jesus" is NOT exclusive to iTunes.  As a matter of fact, I remember hearing "SDUJ" like 10 years ago.  I think it was probably the first Flaming Lips song I'd ever heard.  Yeah, both of those songs are on the cd single that came out in '93.

      Woodski,  checked out the page and I'll have to get some more info on some of those  bands.  I just mailed out my first disc today.  We're called the "Disc  Junkies."  Very much kin to the Afterburners.  Grab some silky waves in  Diego and tell Danae that I say what it is.  I'm heading to Snowbird this  weekend.  Trying to get some fresh snow as Denver doesn't have too much.   I'll stop by the Artic Circle for you and then chase it down with some Hogi  Yogi.  Hayes

      Ursus says about Elbow's new album:  "#9 is probably the catchiest song on the record, “Buttons and Zips”. It begins with a really cool guitar progression and a few doo-doo-doo-doo-doo’s. I’m already sold, but by the time the chorus sneaks in so naturally, saloon piano and handclaps in tow, I’m absolutely won over. This is the melody that I find coming to mind hours and days later, stuck in my head in a good way".  Thanks Mike, you SOB.  I swear, if it was not all wrapped up and postage paid, i would immediately open up ABCD9 and re-burn all of the cd's without that track on them!  grrrrr...  ABCD9 is wrapped up and sitting on my desk.  I am waiting for josh's address.  someone email it to me (scottgravatt@yahoo.com).  In the morning, after i take an unexpected trip to the dentist for my daughter ( urlLink picture ) i will be at the post office, and they will be in the mail.  2 things.    1 -  look for it in the mail.  i mean really look, you might miss it :-) 2 - i have a tracklisting complete with links, commentary and liner notes online, but i don't want to reveal the link until you get the CD.  so i'll post it monday / tuesday am, or give it to you when you email me for it, whichever comes first.  enjoy!

      Alright, boys. After a weekend toiling away, I finally narrowed down the field to 18 tracks and an hour and nineteen minutes of bonafide brilliance. I created the blog for the  urlLink tracklisting , but I don't have access to the template for this page. As such, I can't add the link to the rest of them. So Ben, if you could do me the honors, I'd appreciate it. Following suit, the link is: http://ABCD11.blogspot.com.  CDs should ship tomorrow, so be expecting them in your mailboxes soon. Enjoy.

      Hey guys. I just got fired from my job yesterday and then, last night, my house burnt down to the ground along with everything inside it...including my computer. So I don't think I'll be able to step up to bat for Afterburners 11...'cause I don't have a computer...even though I'm on one now. Can someone else go next and give me another month to come up with another excuse? Thanks. Oh, by the way, I'm kidding. 11 will be undergoing construction this weekend.

      sweet.  this "team blog" is really working out.  i'd like to propose a future afterburners get together.  like a short weekend centered around a music festival.  the winter music confrence here in miami, or what's the name of that one in new york, or SBSX in texas, or even sundance.  that would be so sweet if we could all meet up and get some nice tickets.    it's cool how you can get to know someone by a mix CD.    i've got some sweet hook-up tickets to the Strokes tomorow night.  yeah!! yeah!! (the last time she told me they were hook-up tickets" it was like 8th row center radiohead), so i'm expecting something nice.

      fellow 'burners,  i am now officially registered as a blogger.  #10 was superb.  super.  supa.  i love nada surf.  never heard them before.  always thought their band name was clever, but not anything that reliable friends put into my hands.  i now question the validity of several friendships.  wait, no.  but i DO like nada surf.  very nice.  kent is always a favourite, and "quiet heart" is one of my favourite songs.  the rest of the tunes are cool, too, flowing together nicely with my faves.   i could have sworn that the turin brakes song was a ween track...  dude, but no.  aieet,  asher

      as anticpated, my attempts to impress the omnicient Jones failed. I should just bow out.  that braddigan was great when i was stuck in my room all day last fall hacking away at cxc and freelance work. i was rarely out of the apt. much longer than to see the sunset. so i needed some upbeat good music. that hit the spot for me. can't say i have any idea what's going on w/ the O.C.

      Got mine last week - Friday, I think. You may have cause for concern, Bubar. It's alright, Dave. The mix, I mean. I'm always up for some Spoon. I was surprised to find that on it. I didn't know you'd heard of them. But, yeah, they're great. I urge anyone that likes the Spoon songs to search out more of their stuff. "Girls Can Tell" and "Series of Sneaks" are my two favorite albums of theirs. Also glad to see some Nada Surf on the disc. They're pretty cool, even though they won't ever get out of the wake of "Popular" no matter how hard they try. There was a great moment on last week's episode of "The O.C." at the end where Anna was leaving to go back to Pittsburgh and Seth didn't want her to go and they were playing Nada Surf in the background. It was awesome. A cover of "If You Leave" by Orchestral Maneuvres in the Dark. I seriously almost cried. It was heartwrenching. Anyway, next time less Braddigan. And more John Ruebens.

      the gary allen song was a last minute entry. Danae was listening to the cd and I overheard this song. it was so funny i had to add it. It starts off sounding so "spiritually" encouraging, but listen to the words especially him talking toward the end.

      i was going to make this a complete suprise but i've realized that it's better i let it out now.  ABCD#17 will be composed entirely by myself. i have been using garage band 3 months now and i'm hooked!!!! i would love to see the evolution of AB into everyone contributing their OWN music. if you're skeptical that we'll all put out the "same stuff", you're wrong. this program is as deep as photoshop is. it will go as deep as your creativity will take you. to quote my good friend hayes:: "it's better to play in a bad band, than listen to a good one." i'm hoping this gives you all time to think and prepare for your next disc. i have 3 songs done, hoping for 10 by 10/1/04 who's with me!!!

      I like this discussion - here are my top three from each disc in the Afterburners catalog, thus far:   v.1 : 3) Ashcroft - The Miracle, 2) Radiohead - Where I End..., and 1) Herbie Hancock - Rock It   v.2 : 3) South - Here On In, 2) Seahorses - Love is the Law, and 1) John Reubens - Hindsight (purely for it's tremendous humor value - I can now drop this one whenever I want to blast Dave's mixmaking skills)   v.3 : 3) Bright Eyes - One Foot In Front of the Other, 2) Postal Service - Sleeping In, and 1) Aqualung - Strange & Beautiful (I Put A Spell On You)   v.4 : Impossible to pick just 3 - no filler ANYWHERE!   v.5 : 3) Death In Vegas - Scorpio Rising, 2) Modern English - I Melt With You, and 1) Primal Scream - Autobahn 66   v.6 : 3) Jurassic 5 - Concrete Schoolyard, 2) Death Cab - I Was A Kaleidoscope, and 1) Frou Frou - Hear Me Out (SO GOOD in the "Garden State" trailer!)   v.7 : 3) The Faint - Total Job, 2) The Darkness - I Believe In A Thing Called Love, and 1) Cat Power - He War   v.8 : 3) Outkast - Bowtie, 2) Travis - Midlife Krysis (perhaps a reference to Canadian CCM'ers "The Kry"? - eerrrrr, I think not!), and 1) Chemical Brothers - Get Yourself High   v.9 : 3) Elbow - Buttons and Zips, 2) The Shins - Young Pilgrim, and 1) Polyphonic Spree - Light and Day (Reach For The Sun)   v.10 : 3) ----, 2) The Verve - Two Step, and 1) Spoon - Don't Let It Get You Down   v.11 : Once again, too many to narrow down the field. Exquisite compilation! Who is responsible for this one!  I'm out!

      Guys, it's great to see the positive response to my mix. I had such a hard time whiddling it down to that. I had more I wanted to share. Thought about doin' a double-disc, but nixed it. Anyway, I'm psyched that you're all enjoying it so much. I admit I have been enjoying it very much myself. Now to field some of your questions/comments: Ben: the Wayne Everett disc. Ordered it straight from his label,  urlLink Northern Records , last year. It's a quality album. Course, I've been a sucker for all things Prayer Chain and Lassie Foundation-related for years. All those guys have the Midas touch. Matt: I didn't notice the similarity to  Under The Milky Way , but now that you mention it, I can sorta hear it in my head. I'll have to go back and listen to it to fully realize what you're talking about. That's cool...cos that's a great song. You know what would be really sweet would be if he transitioned into it when performing the song live. Anyway, cool. Josh: The Cure do rule. Join the Dots box set, baby. B-sides, b-sides, and more b-sides. It's a treasure trove. Well, the set has got it's fair share of less than mediocre songs, but it's worth the price for the good ones. Disc 3 is the best. This Twilight Garden, Play, Halo, The Big Hand...great tunes. I'm convinced the Cure were the best thing - musically - to come out of the 80s. The best thing, musical or non-musical, to come out of the 80s was a two-way tie between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Yeah, you all know what I'm talking about. Dave: Yes, I can be commissioned for a comp. Call me. We'll talk numbers sometime. I'm seeing six figures...

      yeah, i agree. the mix is really good and i haven't heard of a lot of the bands on there.   one thing i thought was interesting was the song "reality check" by schneider tm has the same beat to it as the song "under the milky way" by the church. i was singing under the milky way to it. i thought it was kind of funny.

      I couldn't possibly have heard him(Josh) right when he said that abcd#12 was late(3 weeks) because he was working on the art/liner notes.  So I take it back, I have no idea why he was late.  It doesn't matter now anyway.  The mix on the one disc labled abcd#12is great, i really like it.  Love the new UNKLE stuff on there.  The other disc, which I'm assuming is the older one, is classic Josh. Nice job compiling the songs....btw, a cd insert is 4.75 inches square.

      Josh(ua), you must really want us to hear that song.  It's made it onto both of the abcd mixes(#5 & #12).  Is there maybe some sort of hidden meassage in the lyrics that we're supposed to hear?  Oh, i know, it your favorite song, right? Agh, i'm just bust'n yur ballz! Good on ya to give us 2 discs this time around, your a good man.

      check the sidebar:  it's really simple, but it just takes a little work to get it there.  asher and josh(ua) still need to fill in the profile (that's only important b/c it's got a space for a current email address, in case someone needs it, for a mailing address or something)  other than that, don't use images in your posts, unless they are smaller than 400px wide, post your tracklistings as you mail them out, ben and i can do the rest.  please leave suggestions / opinions is the comments box of this post.  peace!

      I just got an email from Josh, he says he has 2 discs to send out and that it took him this long because he was working on the liner notes and art work.  But he says they are done.  Better late than never.  He needs everone's addresses though.  So email him with you address. I'm out.

      Are you going to finish the changes to this blog?  Like the cd track listings in the side bar(i only see abcd 1), and the names of the members are all out of order.  Before they had dates next to each person's name as to when they were going next. Does anyone remember who's going after Josh?  It was whoever was going in June.  I know I was August.  Maybe it was Asher.

      some neat things happening at blogger, and this website gets an instant *free* update.   a couple of highlights:  1 - comments!  hell yeah!  no more adding new posts just to respond to the old ones.    2 - profile!  the next time you log in please create your profile.  make sure under the section for your home page *do not out the afterburners site*  put your website.  if you don't have one leave the website questions blank, but please fill out your profile, and keep your email address current.    3 - one of the coolest features is that now blogger keeps every single post that you make on it's own archive page - this means that from now on, when you send out a mix, it is your job to log in to the website, and post the tracklist.  - cause then ben and i will be using that post to keep a permanent archive on the sidebar.  that also means that later this week, you will notice a string of posts with just old tracklistings.  that is so i can start to create the permanent links for them off to the left.  please leave suggestions in the comment box!  i am totally open.  thanks!

          FEBRUARY 2004 Mixed by Scott Gravatt  1 - jus' a rascal - dizzee rascal from the album "boy in a corner".  i heard about dizzee last year from a friend's blog that lives in the uk, and is pretty hip in the club scene.  i would have loved to be the first one to introduce you to him, but alas, everyone seems to have beat me to the punch.  he's shown up in every major music magazine and website as of this month.  damn.  i was almost cool  2 - kill the band - ours from the album "precious".  this is not the best song on the album, it's just one of my favorites.  i chose the first track off the album, 'cause ben (abcd8) chose the last track.  if you like these, you should hear the stuff in between.  3 - young pilgrim - the shins from the album "chutes to narrow".  this should have made it to my favorites of 2003 list, but i didn't get to it in time.  4 - this is not - blonde redhead from the album "melody of certain damaged lemons".  ok here it is.  this is the track to impress your friends with.  just mosey up to the bar, say hi to your friends, and say "how about that blonde redhead album, huh?  then you can say "what? you haven’t heard of blonde redhead?  let me burn you the album"  instant indie-music idol status for all.  5 - she don't use jelly - the flaming lips from the itunes exclusive ep of the same name.  i've been into some of the exclusive stuff on itunes, so this is the first of a few.  6 - light and day/reach for the sun - the polyphonic spree from the album "the beginning stages of".  i included this track, on the off chance that some of you have committed the unforgivable sin of not listening to this.  tps is probably the most original sound in a decade, and besides:  it just makes you all warm and happy inside.  people say that the live shows are like a really good religious experience.  7 - give me my lighter back - the streets from the exclusive itunes ep of the same name.  8 - bowtie - outkast from speakerboxxx / the love below (the album that you will be tired of hearing about after the grammy's).  you got to hand it to them, this is what good american hip-hop is supposed to be - pushing limits and boundaries, evolving, and creativity.  9 - ******** (plastic "jesus") [porch version] - the flaming lips from the itunes exclusive ep "she don't use jelly".  i heard this story about how wayne (tfl) gave jack white (twstripes) some sort of dashboard jesus that lights up, and then wrote a song about it.  i disregarded the story.  i have since seen the movie "cool hand luke", and realize that this song is a cover of a song in that movie.  more than that;  the movie is not the original song.  apparently it is an old negro spiritual song that came to represent rebellion against oppression.  i've now watched the movie about 25 times, and i have all kinds of elaborate theories about cool hand luke, and the gospels that i would love to share with you all sometimes.  the gist of the theory is that the movie is one big allegory for the gospel of luke.  anyway, see it. and here's the song.  10 - love is hell  - ryan adams from the ep "love is hell volume 1".  love is hell.  11 - leaves (edit)  - ours from the album "precious".  here's a song from the middle just incase you didn't believe me.  12 - mary's in india - dido from the album "white flag".  there are more obvious choices from the album, but this song sticks with me b/c of the lyrics.  give it some thought, listen to the hook at the end, and go ahead and feel sad, it's ok.  13 - wonderwall - ryan adams from the ep "love is hell volume1".  a word to the wise:  skip ryan adams latest album "llor dna kcor" that's rock and roll backwards btw.  these ep's (love is hell volume1 and love is hell volume2) were released at the same time as that album, and while they are getting absolutely no press play, they are 10X the album that "llor dna kcor" is.  take for example this version of the popular oasis song.  14 - 11:11 - rufus wainright from the album "want one".  i vowed never to listen to him after that shrek debacle.  but i caved in, and i am glad i got over my homophobia.  i really like it, i don't care what anyone else says.  this song has the hooks, the gay references, the pretty music, and the message.  15 - buttons and zips - elbow from the album "cast of thousands".    16 - avalanche - ryan adams from the ep "love is hell volume 1"   17 - political science - randy newman from the album "the randy newman songbook volume1"  i was introduced to randy newman from all of the soundtracks from my kids dvd's.  he's done complete soundtracks for toy story, monsters inc. and a bunch of other stuff, including a lot of songs that are used as introductions to tv shows.  he has an unmistakable voice and ragtime (i thinks it's called ragtime) style.  nice to listen to.  so i bought the album not realizing that he has this uncanny ability to tell a story in a song.  i love the whole album.  he covers themes such as racism, marxism, and prejudice.  i chose this track b/c it's so appropriate to where america is right now.  regardless of what you think about gwb, iraq, israel, etc.  the truth of the matter is that americans come across as arrogant know-it-all rednecks, and i wish it was otherwise.  18 - somewhere over the rainbow / what a wonderful world. - israel kamakawiwo'ole from the album "facing future".  i guess i'm a new-age nerd for owning anything classified as "world music", but after you listen to the undisputed master of the steel guitar genre you will understand.  while you are listening to this, try to imagine a 500 pound hawaiian in traditional garb with this beautiful voice.  I listened to this on repeat about 5x in a row one day.  19 -  i shall be released - jeff buckley  from the double disc "live at the sin'e" deluxe edition.  fyi:  this is an old hymn, it is not his song.  does anyone else find it uncanny that jeff buckley sang about his death so often?  this song made me cry the first time i listened to it on my ipod sitting on my back porch well past midnight.  20 - redemption song - johnny cash with joe strummer  from the 5 disc special posthumous "selections" album.  johnny cash, joe strummer, bob marley.  i don't need to justify this one do i?  and it's such a fitting way to close a mix cd.

      fellows of the post-fuego,  all apologies for being out of the loop.  i just got back in town from a few weeks of being out of town on a sculpture installation.  could not get online while gone.  and definitely could not get to my computer to make the CDs.  the final draft is compiled too...  tragic.  anyway, there are no excuses, i should've had this done in may... but... dude but no.  again, this is apology.  also, this is announcement.  this thursday, i compile the copies and mail them out fri or sat.  for real though.  thanks for patience.  and no worries for lack of it.  you all deserve more than my slackitude.  and hopefully, my mix will deliver the goodz.    talk more soon,  asher    "most art is revenge on the world anyway." -thom yorke

      so remember when i said that i wanted to replace brother w/ my cousin? well now i have her address. Esther 699 poncedelon ave #319 Atlanta, GA 30308  she's got the skills and will have that female touch.  also, I met a good buddy of Tim russo's this weekend. Tim was working at a record label, loves music, the whole nine yards and he introduced me to Tyler. Tim introduced him as "the guy i get all my music from" so we started talking ABCD and he laughed and said he already does it, but not in a club. just one offs to good friends. so i asked him if he'd like to join. he said he has about 2,100 songs in his ipod. he replied to my email today:  >>i checked out the afterburners cd club page. there where a lot of bands i knew of and a lot i had not. i'd be stoked to jump into the mix and share my passion for music as well.  so what do you think? He'd bring in some more west coast flavor.

      okay maybe i spoke a little to soon. i got all hyped up on my garageband and i'm still excited about it but i got kind of busy to keep on that project. so i'll probably be putting out a combo of sorts. i mean i don't want to be late seeing the intensity of this crowd.

      Asher + Matt, Has the June 2004 edition of Afterburners gone out in the mail yet? I just gotta get on your case, because as a founding member, I cannot encourage a spirit of complacency by sitting idly by. Last month's was late (by a whole month). And Matt Bubar, how's "14" coming? I'll be expecting yours the first week of July, too. Just cause the last couple have been late doesn't mean all the others get pushed back. I'm not saying yours was going to be, by any means. Just wanted to clear that up in case there was any question. I hope I don't sound like a total dick. Just wanted to remind everyone. I expect the best out of each and everyone one of you. Don't disappoint me. This hurts me far more than it hurts you. I take this club VERY seriously. I hope that you will, too. If not, I'll get the dobermans on your asses.  Jonze

      Hey everyone, I hope you don't mind but I took the liberty of utilizing my administrative priveleges on this blog. I added artwork for all of the Afterburners discs that came with artwork. I had them all scanned in for my iTunes artwork window anyway, so I thought "what the hell." I stuck them in the posts that Scott did last month and then i changed the  links in the template to go to those posts rather than the individual blogspots they were at before. I didn't like how you clicked on one of the "previous volume" links and then you were taken to a page that looked totally different from the new Afterburners Blog page. So now it's all uniform. Like I said, I hope nobody minded me doing that. Check it out and let me know if you had problems with it. It was just bugging me, so I had to fix it. By the way, no artwork for volumes 5 (josh) and 10 (dave).

      I was just thinking...I can't believe I won't be making another Afterburners mix until November. You guys have no idea what you're missing out on. I've been made to feel like I'm not allowed to send you stuff unless it's my turn. And for fear of being ostracized (sp?), I just tuck my tail between my legs and wait.

      I am just wondering if Esther is really in or not.  She still hasn't posted or signed up to post on the site here.  Just wanted to know if she's committed or not.  I'll hold her's until I hear otherwise.  "Esther are you there?  Just wave you hand."  And I'll also be holding Asher's mix untill I recieve #13.  Sorry dude, but 2 months is too long.  For real tho'.  Other than that, ABCD-XV went out today so be on the lookout.

      doubters, believers, naysayers, himhawers, g-force, brethren, and betrayed,  &nbsp; i am full of muchos apologies for tardiness, and a desire to explain and display all the art that has been created in the last month at the expense of the timeliness of this schaweet CD.&nbsp; but, i will save you all from my verbose stumblings and shameless self promotions, and will just gird up my loins and dish out a "thirtEEn."&nbsp; technically it's not CD #13, but i guess the 14th floor in buildings is also technically something else...&nbsp; that begs another question:&nbsp; with 12 apostles, does that make jesus #13, or #1?&nbsp;  &nbsp; anyway, i will publish the track listing in a couple days, giving this time to mail out...&nbsp; thanks again, to peepz with patience.&nbsp; i resolve to live, with all my might, while i do live. &nbsp; more soon.&nbsp;  for real tho', &nbsp; ash &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Hey, guys. Guess what... It looks like a copy of Afterburners 15 has leaked and found its way into the filesharing networks of the world. I found it yesterday on Soulseek. Ben, I wouldn't trust your friends so much and I'd keep an eye on that computer of yours! Anyway, if anyone wants an advance copy, let me know and I'll pull some strings.

      Didn't we decide a while back that each member is only allowed to invite one new member into the club? I invited Matt a while back and Dave didn't you invite someone already?  So, what I'm say'n is, do we all agree that it's ok for a member to add multiple people at once?  I'm still not sure if this is fair.  I mean, I can think of plenty of people, that I know, that would be great for this club, but do i add them? No, because I've already used my invite.  I can't remember 100% but didn't Dave use his invite on Asher? Dont mind me, I'm just being a legalistic pain in the ass!
