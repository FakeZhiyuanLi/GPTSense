      Bureaucracy is one of the few things I really,  really  hate with a passion. I'm not sure where this pathological hatred stems from, a fair guess would be my internship at our version of the IRS (I'll refer to it as the IRS from here on after for simpleness' sake) when I was in 9th grade. A despicable place filled with aging narrow minded hags who were trying to quit smoking by chewing that nicotine gum... whatever, I'd rather continue smoking. When asked what I did for a hobby I said role playing games, which I played back then (and still do from time to time I'm afraid). Their reply to that was something along the lines of "doesn't that make people  violent ?". That wasn't really a good start, and the fact that the job in and of itself was about as fun and stimulating as staring into a brick wall didn't make things better. There I shoveled tax returns for two weeks before they let me go with slip saying I did a nice job. They also made me sign a paper saying I shouldn't leak any of their "business secrets" (whatever the fuck those were). Amidst this ocean of misery, boredom and overly complicated filing systems I did however manage to have some fun. In their IRS database they had some entries of dead persons, who recently perished. So, I changed the "dead person" acronym to such rich titles as "eliminated", "taken care of", "liquidated" etc. Ha ha ha! Eeeh.  This doubtlessly started, or probably spurred, my already vigorous mistrust of papershovelers everywhere. It's not just the work which I loathe, it's the whole aura that surrounds these dull, grey concrete institutions. The hollow government drones that work there, their bankrupt lives and their to me completely uninteresting pastimes. Naturally, they every coffee brake they get they must also discuss their snotty offspring to which they have given the misfortune of living in this world.  Moving on; a year or so ago I took a computer course at the local community collage, and because of my studies I got a student loan. That to me seemed almost like a "proper" income, with an influx of cash I wasn't used to... ah yes, student loans are nice, until  they want the money back , that is. After the completion of the course I got a bill in the mailbox so I could pay back the money the educational board so graciously had bestowed upon me. So the slips arrived from time to time, days turned to weeks and weeks into months until it reached the point where I saw the logo on the envelope and thus didn't even bother to open it. But come on, it's a  student loan , I mean, you don't can pay those back pretty much whenever you want to don't you? Eh? So a few days ago I got a slip in my mailbox that basically said "pay back your student loan or we're going to open up a can whoop-ass on you, i.e. involve a certain authority that  WILL  collect the said amount." Fucking hell, doesn't anyone have any respect for people who doesn't open their letters anymore? I have a plan though, and theoretically things should work out... I'll update the situation on this later... but for fuck's sake, paperwork combined with hostile minded government agencies depresses me to no avail. It's like a cold war era terror balance or some sort of hellish symbiosis, society can't function without it but oh how I hate it.  Today's question: If you were a hotdog and you were starving, would you eat yourself?  Wow, I actually wrote something.

      Might as well update this bitch.   - I think that people who are opposed to abortion are generally fucking stupid. Ever tried squeezing out a kid through your lower abdomen and then raise it on a minimum wage? No? Then shut the fuck up, nitwit.   - I don't believe in God, ghosts, astrology, UFO's or the supernatural. I fully respect people who believe in such things, as long as they keep that crap to themselves that is.   - I think that organized religion is a good example of how painfully morose humanity can be when the pack mentality kicks in on a large scale. Anyone trying to impose their (pseudo) religious beliefs upon others should have their Achilles tendons sliced off and thrown into a pit filled with hungry hyenas. Might as well nip it in the bud before we start killing eachother en masse over such a silly reason as which invisible man you should pray to. I mean, really... who the heck would do such a stupid thing? Oh wait, we've been doing that non-stop for the past&nbsp; couple of thousand years .&nbsp;   - I think that 99,8% of all sports are the pinnacle of boredom to watch. Unless there's a passenger airliner crashing into the stadium during the local baseball game, I'm not fucking interested.   - Music piracy is a-ok with me.   - I like France. I like their culture, their food, their music and their language.   - I have never understood rap music, nor have I cared for it.   - Metallica fucking sucks.

      Today must have been one of the shittiest days in my life lately. I tried run banking errands today and ended up feeling like a fucking rubber ball being bounced around to different institutions, none of which could help me. I'll spare you the details because I don't want to bore you more than I already am. So death, pain, angst, misery, damnation etc. The world was against me today. And to top it all off, I had to walk home through a fucking rainstorm and pay off bills with a shitload of money. I'm usually not an easy guy to piss off, but they should thank their lucky star(s) that I don't have access to  urlLink firearms .  That was a fun read, no?

      Movie night last night with beer and unhealthy food. I got rather tipsy and had a generally fun time until the inevitable hangover headache awoke me around 9am. One of the movies I had the privilege of watching last night was  urlLink Buffalo Soldiers , a flick which I thought was pretty damn good, painting a less than flattering image of the U.S. army. My favorite scene in the movie would be when the crew of a M1 Abrahms tank, all high as kites, rampages through town. The other one we beheld was  urlLink The Fear 2  which we watched purely to get some laughs (note the grade it got). I also found  urlLink this picture  over at boners.com. I found it to be highly amusing.  While on the subject of movies,  urlLink Marlon Brando  gave up the ghost yesterday. I want to be like him when I grow up... a young, dashing movie star turned obese, creepy old man. Oh well, if you substract the movie star part I'm basically halfway there. Adios, I really liked your movies... well most of them, anyway.  Earlier today something happened. In a rarely seen spectacle, especially since I was more or less hung over, I ventured outside the apartment. Went to buy some cigarettes, and the store clerk handed me a completely different brand than that I asked for. I don't know, apparently some people can't tell the difference between the phrases "vanliga Prince" and "Marlboro!". I brought my digicam along when I left the apartment, and then proceeded to wander aimlessly through town taking snapshots of random crap. The result of this photography spree you can see  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .   Feels like my head is about asplode now, damn migrane. I'll take something that knocks me out and hope that the sleep will cure it. So cheerio for now, I leave the last word to Mr. Brando:      "The more sensitive you are, the more likely you are to be brutalized, develop scabs and never evolve. Never allow yourself to feel anything because you always feel too much."   1924 - 2004

      Told the authorities that I wanted the necessary (shudder) paperwork so it'll arrive in a couple of days. So right now I can only wait.  Drinking tonight it seems... I probably need it.
