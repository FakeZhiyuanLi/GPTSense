      (Statutory Warning: You may encounter extremely exaggerated description of seemingly uneventful and harmless occurrences and situations below. At any point of time should you feel acrimonious towards any living entity, please abstain from reading further.)  Forbidden apples always find their devourer(s). &#8220;Devourer&#8221; might be too superlative a description (devourest?), portraying greed, sin and gluttony, but substituting it with &#8220;eater&#8221; would make matters too frivolous. However, it is not the person or the act that&#8217;s under scrutiny, but the infamous, tempting apple. Delay it or succumb to it, don&#8217;t you try avoiding it because its there, waiting to gobble you up. Wonder who is eating whom, huh? My apologies for making metaphors this redundant, but I am jolly confident that the readers are not as clueless as I am, neither with metaphors nor about the point I am trying to make.  &#8220;Corporate Life&#8221;, I am thankful to you for making me appreciate artworks of Sir Scott Adams and understand the Axioms of Prof. Murphy (with corollaries). For a major part of life, before stepping into the C-world, I was largely indifferent to the feelings of and in &#8220;Dilbert&#8221;. Now, not only do I derive masochistic pleasure out of reading the comic strip but I, at times, am forced to make-believe that I am staying right inside one. So its here, where I fulfilled one of my childhood fantasies; that of living in a &#8220;toon-world&#8221;, albeit it was so real that I wondered what real world for real would look like.    So going back to the frenzy days of final year placements in the Engineering College, I am reminded of how my peers romantically involved their selves in keeping options up their sleeves. One cannot help but admire their indefatigable faith in their versatile capabilities. GRE, CAT, MINPAT, AINTREAL, GATE, DOORKNOB et al, you name it and you will find at least a dozen amicable blokes flashing their illustrious scorecards for it! But for some humble mortals, &#8220;life&#8221; after graduation found a different noun-adjective-prefix: &#8220;Corporate&#8221;. And to a miniscule part of that &#8220;some&#8221;, such as yours truly, another exciting yet dreaded proposition accompanied it, &#8220;Mumbai&#8221;!  Not many would question the popular belief that, in India a successful &#8220;Corporate life&#8221; would ideally culminate to a lifestyle that implores you to drive down (preferably in a Merc) through Marine Drive, to your office (preferably a multi-storeyed-building) at Nariman Point, from your residence (preferably a Penthouse) in the South of &#8220;Mumbai&#8221;. Judging by the definition, many of us have right now accomplished 3/29 (3 = Mumbai + Corporate + Life) of what it takes. Please have mercy and avoid generous extrapolations. But what is the real challenge in life? It is all about finding a firm footing, especially if you happen to travel in the local trains amidst the unrelenting deluge of honorable fellow citizens. I personally administer local anesthesia to my lower half of the body whenever any unavoidable contingency invites me to use this popular means of transport. It is here that I discovered the other meaning of the term &#8220;square feet&#8221;, which otherwise is popularly used to measure (in SI units) the area of any planar expanse in the expensive real estate dealings of Mumbai. Any further attempt to describe the adventure would only make it trite, for there are a million people who have a similar emotional attachment and better linguistic aptitude to do appropriate justice. To cut a long story short, Mumbai greets and treats one and all alike, although, if you are too critical about &#8220;greetings&#8221; and &#8220;treatings&#8221;, you may not endorse my opinion. Cities like Mumbai are full of people. And People I did meet, lots of them.   Then, there are some People who think they manage &#8220;rest of the people&#8221;. The figurative herdsmen minding their sheep that madly run helter-skelter. The toughest nuts (Voila! pun?) to crack in any corporate tree of nuts. The word &#8220;people&#8221; when used in certain contexts, such as &#8220;HR-people&#8221;, presumably refers to a less endowed predecessor to Homo Sapiens, with a negative Grey Matter count. &#8220;Ripley&#8217;s Believe it or not!&#8221; once reported that the famous Ancient Chinese tortures are a refined form of Modern HR policies and practices. Ripley believed it but was fired and was dubbed a blasphemer for his alleged erratic interpretation of HR tortures. He begged to be strung up by the thumb instead, but they took away his LTA. That&#8217;s History but the sad legacy continues. The greatest oxymoron to ever strike the planet is &#8220;HR-Initiative&#8221;. One such initiative, in a famous Zambian Multinational Co., aimed at improving the quality of food at lunch. The result was stupendous. People really liked the food but they strongly felt they would rather appreciate if they could eat it as well. Very aptly put indeed. Food is better off if it suits the gourmet&#8217;s palate rather than resembling an aftermath of Picasso&#8217;s colourful palette. And then there are some who devote a lifetime specializing in these torture techniques. Growing horns, a pointed tail and developing a reddish complexion is an occupational hazard that they risk. And what is life without a generous seasoning of risk? Even Socrates profusely preached about the advantages of &#8220;Risk-Taking&#8221; in life before he himself took his first risk (Hemlock ensured that his risk-list doesn&#8217;t grow). How true! A Radio-Jockey should not quit complaining of too much radioactivity!    Not all chores call for a huge appetite for risk. Darwinian theory talks of survival of the fittest and mutation as the natural mechanism for adaptations. And that is how diverse species evolved. But there is a brilliant species, that not so long ago emerged from the soil of this country: The &#8220;Softies&#8221;. No, I am not referring to genetically engineered ice cream. They are the outcome of a boom, the martyrs of a bust, victors of another boom, survivors of another bust and so on; collectively called the IT Revolution (pardon the recursion)! And then came the BPO sweepstakes. The lifestyle of the 5-day-working, weekend-partying, JAVA-mouthing, fat-paycheck-pocketing, offshore-visit-dreaming and heart-melting softies is pretty much talked about highly in the intellectual circles. A softy&#8217;s life is bed of roses, as it seems to us: the &#8220;Hardies&#8221; (non-software, non-MBA, non-NRI). Even a careless glance at the matrimonial section of any daily, painfully reminds us of our insignificance:  &#8220;Wanted groom / SOFTWARE professional ONLY / settled US / looks don&#8217;t matter / USD paycheck does&#8230;&#8221;  And not to mention the self-pity that involuntarily gets aroused when the glossy job advertisements in the same daily appear at the turn of a few pages. Plethora of acronyms (XML, SQL, ALPHA Q, to name a few) flood the chaste ambiance and the dagger of obsolescence sinks deep into the psyche, leaving behind a gory trail of dented morale. Well, it is not as bad as it sounds. Thanks to the Murthys and the Premjis, Uncle Sam and his Euro-Dog are on a reluctant source-searching spree. Sniff-sniff! It&#8217;s a game of sources now, be it cheap-job-outSource or indigenous-human-reSource. Businesses that keep the coffers ticking and the workplaces stinking! Sniff-sniff again.  One can go great lengths talking about businesses and the morality of wealth accumulation. But to ignore the contribution of the Modern Messiahs would do their selfless, sprightly spirits grave injustice. The MBAs add the much-needed glamour to the corporate world. Give them a laptop (the gizmo) and be rest assured that they would work their way up for another laptop (you know what!). And make no mistake; their superb articulation prowess is evident from the superior usage of English language. Call it linguistic chicanery or etymological jugglery or simply jargon but never underestimate its efficacy:   &#8220; In contradiction to the Consultant&#8217;s review, a balanced management approach applied over a synchronized transitional time-frame to curb any functional reciprocal contingency is very much the need of the hour. However, it calls for compatible incremental flexibility in a structured watertight organization like ours, especially when there is rampant Bullish run looming large over the volatile Capital Markets, threatening to impede the Outward-bound Strategic Plan&#8230;.&#8221;   Only the Indian Mass Media can outperform, when it comes to rendering such profound superficiality to matters of greater significance. But it&#8217;s not just the MBAs who rejoice indulging in such verbose existence, but almost every tyro in the C-world actually tries his/her hand at it quite dedicatedly (including yours truly, as must be evident from this article, albeit, in traces!). TQM, ISO, Six Sigma, JIT etc. seem to have been elaborately interpreted as means of adding newer intricacies to straight logical thinking and also at providing optimum solutions, in interludes.   And finally we have this fascination for the Superior Western Civilization. America is happening and the &#8220;Yo Man!&#8221; culture is kicking (you know where!). And what better way to be oblivious to it than trying to preserve the &#8220;Indian tradition&#8221; by actually ending up in the US of A. There is unquestionable clarity in this aspect: Try being an Indian when in America and ape an American when in India. Yeah dude! Where else are you gonna get to live the best of both worlds, huh? And no one&#8217;s complaining, me is not for sure! Cliched as it may sound, but change indeed is the only constant and so embrace it for good. But the gradual and voluntary tendency to disown one&#8217;s roots is unsettling. Some serious food for thought here.   That precisely summarizes the situation that I find myself at the near completion of one frantic year in this wonderful C-world. Critical dissection of the viewpoints herein is always welcome, especially if it supports my line of thinking! Coming back to apples, however sinful a temptation they seem to be, they are known to keep a certain sect of benevolent people away. Although scientifically debatable, I have no qualms in agreeing to this age-old adage. I intend to stick to my Apple, having taken the first bite!
