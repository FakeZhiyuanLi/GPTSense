      Today began with the potential for a bad day.  I was awoken at 9:30, and my father informed me that today was the lucky day that we would visit the transfer station/dump.  That was a smelly and messy job, and it was thankfully finished by 11:00.  After that, I showered and lounged around for an hour, until Trevor got here and we went to lift.  Nothing exciting happened there, and I was back home at about 1:30.  I once again sat around for a while, and at about 2:00, I left the house with the idea of running errands.  My first stop was the bank, and I saw Sara.  I went over and talked to her for several minutes, and we ended up going back to her house for a while.  While we were there, we looked at women's clothing in an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog.  Since we didn't go for a walk on Sunday, we decided to make up for it today.  We walked from her house to the Kinney's warehouse, where she picked up an application for work, and then we headed for the East Side Playground.  We played on the swings for several minutes (an activity that I have missed doing, by the way), and then we sat down by the monkey bars and talked some more.  After that, our walk recommenced down Gleason Street.  We were heading towards my house, and I told her that she shouldn't have to walk home alone, and we hung a quick left and started back toward her house.  She showed me a condemned building where she used to think I lived, and when we got to her house, we sat on her back porch and talked for several minutes.  I would have been quite content to just sit there all day and talk, but I had a soccer game to go to.  So at about 4:30, she gave me a ride home.  So ended my first walk with Sara.  It was quite an enjoyable experience.  When I returned home, I quickly located a ride.  Lammy brought me to Travis' house, where we waited for Justin, then we headed towards IR for our game.  We lost 1-0.  Within the first 5 minutes, I had already been jump-kicked in the leg.  That was quite painful, but I played on.  I did enjoy talking trash with some of the kids on that team, because they were so horrible at it.  One rather overweight kid called me fat, and another one called me gay.  Those two insults cut me deeply.  Somehow, I have no idea how, one of those kids ended up on the ground.  I played fairly well, I think.  My leg does hurt, but after such a good day, I couldn't care less.

      Well, today began like any other so far this vacation, with me getting roughly six hours of sleep.  My inability to sleep for long periods of time is puzzling, yet it does not seem to adversely affect me in any way.  Anyway, after I woke up, I sat around and did absolutely nothing for several hours.  Big Head and I were supposed to lift at 10, but he didn't show.  Around noon, I thought going for a walk would make me feel better.  However, as I was walking, who should I come across but Trevor himself.  He stopped and picked me up, and we drove to my house, so I could change my clothing, and then off to lift.  I set a personal best in the bench press, one which I won't divulge here, to avoid embarrassment.  After that, I went home and was asked to work in place of my sister this evening.  This is something that my dear friend Sara would call an opportunity cost.  I was giving up something, my Tuesday evening off, in order to gain something of equal or greater value, Saturday.  I wanted Saturday off so that I would be able to attend a graduation party I was invited to.  I was also invited to Madeline's graduation party on Sunday, and hopefully I am able to attend that one as well. Today is Tuesday, June 29.  In one week Driver's Education begins.  I received some news about that today as well. According to Renee Besaw, Nikki Weaver is no longer in my car.  My car now consists of myself, Tiffany Cummings, Renee Besaw, Mr. Knowlton, and an undisclosed person.  I hope they aren't short.  The Tuesday after next, the 13th, is my birthday.  It is not a milestone that I am looking forward to, as my birthdays are usually depressing and lonesome.  Perhaps it will be different this year, but that's doubtful.  The Tuesday after that, the 20th, is the day that the St. Lawrence County Fair begins, an event that will bring rednecks from all over this county to our town.  This is quite an eventful month.  Well, I guess I'll leave it at that.

      This is my first entry on this blog thingy.  I figure I'll just update it as often as I feel like it, which should be just about every day.  I guess I'll just talk about my day and the such.  Here goes. Today I did something really stupid.  Well, I guess it all began yesterday night, when I found out Sara couldn't walk with me.  She was previously occupied.  I became upset, for whatever reason.  My away message when I went to bed was a rather scathing one.  Shortly after I awoke, I conversed with her and managed to yell at probably the nicest girl in the whole world.  That was a good way to start the day. However, my day did get a little better.  While I was walking around during the day, around 1:30 maybe, I managed to have a rather interesting discussion with Sara's mother and little sister about skirts. After that, I walked over to the Trackside to lift, I thought by myself.  However, Trevor had also just gotten there, and we ended up lifting together.  After that "drove-through" McDonald's for lunch, with me on the paying end. Then came the part of the day I look forward to least, work.  It was deathly slow, and extremely boring.  Eventually, however, it ended and I was able to come home.  Now here I am, sitting at my computer creating my first blog entry.  I'll end it here.

      Well...it's been a very long time since I updated this thing.&nbsp; I do have an excuse for that.&nbsp; Several excuses, actually.&nbsp; First off, and mainly, I was grounded from the Internet for a week and a half.&nbsp; Let me take you back in time, roughly a week and a half ago, Friday the 9th.&nbsp; That is where it all began.&nbsp; Let's see, my mother was not working that Friday, and that was half the trouble.&nbsp; I went to pick up my check at my work, left my house at about 10:00 AM.&nbsp; I received my check at about 10:30, and I went to the bank to deposit my check.&nbsp; I realized that it was the Friday that I was supposed to deliver gummy worms and bears to Savanna.&nbsp; I went to Kinney's, bought some gummies, and went to her house to give them to her.&nbsp; It was approximately 11:00 when I got there.&nbsp; I only intended to stay a few minutes, but I was mistaken.&nbsp; I was there for almost 4 hours, in which time I watched the end of a movie with Sara,&nbsp;tried to guess what present Savanna got me, cooked their dinner for a while, and crawled under their back porch to retrieve their mother's bracelet.&nbsp; It was fun, oddly.&nbsp; When I got home at 3:00, my mother informed me that I was grounded indefinitely for not informing her of where I was.&nbsp; I thought that was rather harsh, but I did not say anything.&nbsp; I went to work that night, and when I got home at 9, my father made me produce my Internet adapter.&nbsp; That weekend was rather boring, as it was all work and no play.&nbsp; On Monday, I had driver's ed in the morning, and after that I worked from 12-9.&nbsp; My co-workers thought they would announce over the loudspeaker that my birthday was the next day.&nbsp; I was still grounded when I came home Monday evening, and also on Tuesday morning, my birthday.&nbsp; I had the best birthday of my entire life, I believe, in spite of the fact that I was grounded.&nbsp; I remember it vividly.&nbsp; In the morning, I went to drivers ed class from 7:30-8:30, and largely attracted little attention, which is good.&nbsp; I don't like lots of attention.&nbsp; I went home after that and sat around, kind of bored.&nbsp; At 10:00, I went over to the school and sat on Mark Lamson's car as I waited to drive.&nbsp; Renee Besaw brought me ice cream, which I enjoyed.&nbsp; Then Savanna brought me my presents.&nbsp; A pair of Aeropostale shorts, and a lollipop (a reference to our Theatre Arts play) were her gifts to me, and I liked them very much.&nbsp; I was very touched that she got me something.&nbsp; I would have loved it no matter what.&nbsp; Anyway, after that, I went driving and almost hit a house backing up.&nbsp; I might need a little practice.&nbsp; After that little adventure, I went home and sat around for the afternoon.&nbsp; At about 5:00, Maddie asked me if&nbsp;I wanted to go mini-golfing with her.&nbsp; I asked my father, and he agreed, much to my surprise.&nbsp; At 6:00, she came and got me, got me a card, and we went mini-golfing.&nbsp; That was extremely enjoyable, and I had fun.&nbsp; When we finished our 18 holes, we went for a ride in go-karts.&nbsp; Nobody told us beforehand that we weren't supposed to use both tracks.&nbsp; According to the man that was there, that was the first time anyone had ever done that.&nbsp; Really though, they should put up signs or something.&nbsp; We went to Pizza Hut for dinner, and then we went home.&nbsp; She is a lot of fun to hang out with.&nbsp; When I got home, I found a new watch waiting for me.&nbsp; Also, I got my Internet returned to me.&nbsp; I went to bed happy that night.&nbsp; Apparently though, I did not shut down my computer, and I got my Internet revoked again.&nbsp; Anyway, Wednesdays are my favorite days, and losing my Internet did not dampen my spirits much.&nbsp; Drivers ed was boring as usual, and I went home and sat around for a while.&nbsp; Later on, I got my watch adjusted so it would fit my skinny wrist.&nbsp; At about noon, a package arrived with my copy of NBA Live 2004 enclosed.&nbsp; I played that for a while, and at about 3:00, Sara called me, and then she came and picked me up, and we went back to her house.&nbsp; She gave me a choice;&nbsp; we could either go for our walk as is normal, or she could cut my hair for a birthday present.&nbsp; I chose the latter.&nbsp; When we entered her house, I found that she had indeed baked me a cake, and it was a great cake.&nbsp; Sara, Savanna, Nicky, and several of Nicky's friends sang Happy Birthday to me, and I blew out all the candles on my cake.&nbsp; It only took me 4 tries.&nbsp; After that, we ate cake and talked for a while.&nbsp; Then, as it got later, Sara began cutting my hair.&nbsp; Soccer on Wednesday usually meant that I would be picked up by Trevor at 5, but he was unable to go.&nbsp; Therefore, I had to act quickly.&nbsp; While Sara was cutting my hair, I called Mark and had him stop by Sara's so that I could get a ride to Indian River.&nbsp; Sara's mother put the finishing touches on my hair, and I thanked everyone before I left.&nbsp; Mark and I stopped by my house quickly, and then we scrunched in the back seat with Mallory, as Travis sat shotgun and Justin drove.&nbsp; Anyway, we lost again, and although I made some errors, I played decently overall.&nbsp; I did aggravate a pre-existing leg injury.&nbsp; That was Wednesday, fun day.&nbsp; However, the next 4 days were not very remarkable, other than Gouverneur winning Battle of the Bands in Ogdensburg, and event I watched with Maddie and Kyle.&nbsp; That brings us to today, Monday.&nbsp; Once again, I awoke at 7:00 to go to drivers ed class.&nbsp; After that, I sat around and then lifted with Trevor until about 1.&nbsp; We got caught between construction and a stopped train, and we couldn't find a way that didn't involve either, so we eventually took the construction route.&nbsp; We stopped by McDonald's, got some grub, and he dropped me off.&nbsp; After I ate, I got bored, so I went for a walk to think.&nbsp; I walked for about an hour, then I stopped by P&C to visit Sara as she was working.&nbsp; I went home after that, walked to the bank and P&C to pick up paper towels, then went home and ate tacos for dinner.&nbsp; Mmmmm, tacos.&nbsp; That was about it, and I think that's plenty for now.&nbsp;

      Today is Wednesday.  Wednesday is my favorite day of the week this summer, I've discovered.  Today I awoke at 7:00, showered, and went to driver's education for an hour.  I returned home at 8:30, went lifting with Trevor at 9:00, and returned at about 10:00. At about 12:30, I walked to Sara's and we went for our walk as has become our custom on Wednesdays.  On my way there I saw my good friend Roxi.  First we walked to Key Bank to set up her account (a common theme, as you'll come to see).  But the woman that we were looking for was at lunch, so we went back to her house quickly and then we walked to P & C to see a man about a job for Sara.  On the way there and back, I was "stung by a bee" 5 times and pushed into incoming traffic 3 times.  After that, we went to the bank again to try and set up her account.  When we got there, the woman we needed to speak with was on the phone, so we talked quietly for a few minutes.  After a few minutes, we found out that Sara needed her driver's license, which she did not bring with her.  We went back to her house once again, she got her license, and we went back the the bank again.  Once again, the woman was on the phone and we talked for a few more minutes.  Finally, we got her account set up and we walked back to her house, and it started to rain.  She gave me a ride home, and it began to storm.  Eventually, it stopped and Trevor showed at about 5:15, and we went to our game.  Trevor and James played on LaFargeville's team, and my team won 7-4.  I played very well, I thought, but I wasn't sure.  Trevor gave me a ride home and that's all I did today.  I love Wednesdays.

      Today started early, because I had drivers ed at 7:30 this morning.  I got up, showered, and went over to the school.  After waiting for a few minutes, I went up to my class on the 3rd floor.  And then I took a seat in the back of the class and my driver's education experience began.  It was a bit of an orientation day, so it was slightly boring.  After that I went home and slept for about an hour, then went back over to the school to drive.  While I was waiting, I talked with Savanna for the first time in days, Travis, Lammy, and Kim (Mark's sister).  That was fun.  When we got to our car, Mr. Knowlton showed us the basics and then Matt Todd got behind the wheel.  Let's just say he has room for improvement.  Tiffany Cummings was next, and she did alright, except for she made me hit my head multiple times against the top of the car.  Then Renee Besaw drove, and she has her license, so she was pretty good.  Then it was my turn, to drive from the West Side School back to the High School.  Apart from gunning it once, I did pretty well.  After that, I went home.  I ate lunch and sat around until 1, when I went lifting with Trevor and Kyle Rizzo.  I got home at about 2:30, and found that my Interent access had been removed, because I didn't do the laundry, even though I did.  I slept for a few hours, because I was tired.  After that I mowed some of the lawn, ate Chinese food for dinner, and cleaned my room, so I could get my Internet back, which I did.  After that, I sat here and watched TV and talked to people.  That was my day.

      Whoa.  I haven't updated this thing all weekend.  That's probably because I've been having so much fun, which is strange for me.  Well, let me think back.  Saturday I woke up rather late, at about 8:45.  I know, it's not that late, but it is for me.  My leg felt much better, almost back to 100%.  I walked up to lift, and I did legs for the first time in 2 weeks.  I did everything pretty much without pain, except squats.  My leg wasn't having it.  Anyway, after that I walked home.  When I got home, I took a shower and lounged around for an hour or two.  Then Lammy came and got me, we stopped a few places, and then we went to Josh McAdam's graduation party.  It was pretty fun, if a little warm.  Mark and I played horseshoes against Clayton McAdam and a kid named Ricky.  We lost, 21-13, but it was still fun.  After that, there was alot of sitting around and talking, which was enjoyable.  Brian and Ben Peters, Nate Gifford, Glenn Dygert, Marc Smithers, Maggie Simmons, and Sara were all participants in the conversations.  After a while, though, I became bored.  As Marc and Sara were leaving, I asked for a ride home and they agreed.  After I got home, I got hungry and I walked to McDonald's and got something to eat, and as I was walking home, Trevor picked me up and dropped me off at home.  After I ate, I watched a really funny movie, Tommy Boy.  I love that movie.  After that, I set up camp on my front lawn to prepare for fireworks.  My dad let one of our coworker's family park in our driveway.  When they got there, I was sitting out front.  My dad came out and we talked with them for a few moments.  I was introduced to our coworker's family, her daughter and son, and her husband, and a friend of her daughter.  They invited me to watch the fireworks with them, but I declined.  It was remarked that I should have gone, because her daughter thought I was "cute."  Well, the fireworks were pretty good, and the finale was excellent.  So ended my Saturday.  Sunday was hot, especially when I walked to work.  I worked from 9-2, and nothing fun happened then.  At 2, my mother gave me a ride to Kinney's to purchase Maddie a card.  I then walked home and got changed and went to Maddie's party at Nicole's.  It was about 2:30 when I got there.  After Maddie badgered me for several minutes, I had some things to eat.  The chicken was excellent.  Over the course of the 7 hours I was there, I had alot of it.  We played with sticky paddles and a really big tennis ball.  We mostly talked, and I watched people swim.  It was a blast, so to speak.  Later on, we got a game of kickball going.  It was fun too, and I did not get thrown out at second.  After that, Bryan dropped me off at home.  My parents were perturbed because I didn't tell them that I would be gone for so long.  I showered and went to bed, and that was Sunday.  Monday was fun also.  I woke at about 8:30, repaired my Internet, and ate some ice cream for breakfast.  At about noon, I went lifting with Trevor.  After I got done with that, I came home and found out that I was able to go golfing with Kyle.  That was a bunch of fun.  I had never golfed before, and it was a good experience.  I wasn't very good, but that didn't matter, neither was Kyle.  I almost killed us on the golf cart, and I lost my grip once on the backswing when it was raining.  It was hilarious.  After we played 7 holes, Kyle took me home so I could get ready for work.  I went to work, and that was not fun like golfing.  Well, that was my weekend.  Tomorrow morning driver's ed begins at 7:30.  I should probably go to bed soon, but I more than likely won't.

      Well, it's been a few days since I made an entry in this thing, but hey, I'm a busy man, I've got things to do.  Well, let's see.  Oh yes, Thursday morning.  I got off to a good start, getting 9 hours of sleep.  However, when I woke up, there was a problem.  My leg, which had been injured the previous evening, had become very painful.  I found myself unable to do more than walk, and even then I limped.  After experiencing this, I can honestly say that "Limpin' Ain't Easy."  I did need to walk several places during the day, but I was helped by a friend on one such journey.  Bryan Jones picked me up and gave me a ride to McDonald's and home, which was awfully nice of him, and I am grateful that I did not have to walk that distance.  Nothing interesting happened after that, except I struggled through 5 hours of work.  That was basically all that happened on Thursday.  Friday was slightly more fun.  I once again got much sleep, roughly 10 hours worth.  I sat around for an hour or two, then drove to get my check when my mother went to work.  My driving was alright, although there was some room for improvement.  I got my check and walked to the bank and deposited it, and then stopped by McDonald's again before going home.  At about 1:00, Trevor came and we went lifting.  When we got there, Kate Worden was there.  Set a new personal record in the bench press, and had a pretty fun time lifting.  After that, Trevor, Kate, and I went to the Pizzeria for pizza.  Then I went home, and I went to work at 4.  That was annoying and boring.  When I got home, I learned that our shower was broken, and I had to help fix it.  That was not fun.  That was all of what happened the last two days.  My leg feels better, but it's still not fully healed.  I'll be alright.  Ending this now.
