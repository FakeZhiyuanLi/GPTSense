						   I been going to football everymoring this week at 7:30 in the moring.&nbsp; How many of ya'll are up at that time durring the summer daily.&nbsp; It hasn't been that bad.&nbsp; Today I made a group of kids do laps around the field cause one of them got out of line and I couldn't tell which of them said it so they ran until they rat each other out.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;great to have power. After football today, I had a student council meeting.&nbsp; One would think that a student council meeting would be quite and orderly and nothing too radical would be talk about.&nbsp; No we are talking about drag kings and queens.&nbsp; It not as bad as you think but it is still out there.&nbsp; A waring to anyone that goes to Ellender we will get you to get envoled if you like it or not.&nbsp; Sorry just deal with it.&nbsp; There some people that get way to much into it.&nbsp; Like they are willing to kill you if you talk while they are tring to say something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever notice that when you are alone you think of everything.&nbsp; Damn it sucks.

						   Rite now I am at the half way point of the first week of two a day practice for football.  This is probaly the hardest thing anyone can do and this is my fourth year doing it.  I don't even know where some of these brusies are from.  I have to be at school for 7:30 in the a.m. and I don't get home till around 4:30, that nine hours at school.  It is really hot out there and i have no sunscreen.  But I love football and this is my last year of have to deal with it.  I am captain so I get to "lead" everyone else.   On a completly different note I found out this week that I am sexy.  But I think I need medical attention.  You know who you are.

						   Lately I been watching a lot of the reruns of Boy Meets World and I notice several things.  First Topaga or however her name is spell is hot.  Any guy taht watched the show will agree with me.  The second thing is that I grew up watching that show.  I mean when Cory and Topaga broke up, I was actuall upset.  And even though I seen every eposide I still laugh at the jokes.  When I watch the reruns, I try and watch them with my little brother cause he needs a show like it.  There is no new shows like that on TV now and days and that wrong.  Oh by the way Topaga is hot.
