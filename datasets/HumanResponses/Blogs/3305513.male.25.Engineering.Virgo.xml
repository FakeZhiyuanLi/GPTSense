       My goodness, finally one of the NBA teams I was routing for won the game!  Pistons beat the Nets tonight, I am a happy camper...  Mavs and Spurs are both out, Pisotns all the way BABY!!!  Going to game 7 this Thursday with my brother, should be another blast, I will try to convince him to wear the Afro too...  Haha...  Talk to her today...  Things are weird, a lot of ups and downs, now we are in the ups again, if it goes down again, don't think I can take this anymore.  At times, I feel it's slowing me down.  There's so many things I want to accomplish in life, but she is starting to fade out from the picture.  I still love her, but I really see a future...  Sigh, weekend is gone already, other week of work...  /_\

       Man, that was a good movie...  So far, these summer blockbusters are awesome!  I am loving it, there are more to come, I can't wait....  See, I am not very picky about movies, I saw a few since the beginning of May, I gotta say they are all very good.  Let's see what's next - The Day After Tomorrow...  Not expecting a lot, but should be a pretty good flick...  Time to crap out, me tired...

       Man, what a heart breaking lost for the Spurs.  Timmy with a awesome shot with 0.4s left, but just couldn't hold on...  The clock started late, I still think the Lakers got lucky, hopefully they will win the next two.  Man, I have never seen my brother so depressed, only time can tell if his team will make a come back.  Yeah, my team Dallas is already out, Detroit should be able to pull it off tonight...  Yay, weekend is here, me going home...

       Wow, my first ever post anywhere online, but not a newb at this online business, this is kinda cool, I think I will start doing this more often.  Some things in life are frustrating right now, but I am trying to maintain a positive attitude, who isn't right?  Well, I am doing pretty good, pretty proud of myself...  Although it's only been two days, I am kicking ass!  Haha, eat (kinda) right and working out...  Gotta lose weight, gotta lose weight.  Can't wait to begin summer!
