      It's Day two here at Hell camp... this time i made a computer out of some dried crap, a squirrel, and a discarded powerade bottle. I accessed th einternet using some hair clippings, a zip-zap, and a pile of sticks. Today they made me eat my own shit and then hawl ass up to the highest mountain in maine at gunpoint. I had to clean the bathrooms with a spork, and they tied my legs to by back and made me dance for small scraps of raw meat.  Why hasn't help come yet? Hasn't anyone called the police or SWAT teams yet!! MIchael was close to picking me today, and who knows what will happen in th enext three hours. I cant stand this. Imagine being in the Texas chainsaw massacre and house of a thousand corpses only pultply that by how many times you have to go to school each year and thats how horribleit is here... PLease send help.. oh no there coming.....    TRANSMISSION DISCONNECTED

      Ok, I only have a small amont of time to do this... I'm here at camp and my thoughts about it being a labor camp were correct. I have had to make a computer out of some woodchips... MY shoe, and some copperwire made out of urine, sand and some popsicle sticks i found in a toilet. I reached the internet to ask for help... any kind of help. Michael Jackson is making us push logs out and he rapes one kid of choice every three hours... I thought Hell was deep inside the earth... but I was wrong. Oh Crap!! Hes coming I need to destroy this computer or hell touch my "areas all week. OK Bye GET HELP!!!

       Tomorrow I'm going to christian camp for a week, I hope to meet girls and maybe make friends... but thats what i want them to think... or christian camp is what they want me to think im gonna go to. I wouldn't be surprized if it was a slave labor camp that makes people carve toothpicks out of stumps for a week without sleep or food. Maybe I'll have to carry logs and rocks up moutnains just to make wooden elevator buttons. Maybe It will just be an excuse for Michael Jackson to get it on with children. OK, i lost intrest in this topic. Im just gonna try to meat hot chicks there and maybe get a new girlfriend or something but if any of that happens i guess it wont be as fun as i thought. i should remember the theme song to Fresh Prince of Bel-Air so then i will really have a chance with da ladiez... ne ways get back to ya later.
