       Welcome! Make yourself at home... it's my first post. Lol, I'm a blog virgin... well not really ;).  Anyway, I plan to post my goings-on in here (is that gramatical?) for the summer, and maybe even beyond that.  Just to update what's been going on in my life: The job hunt continues, though not as vigorously as before... I figure I'm gonna be gone much of the summer (see below), so a job isn't as much of a priority as before. But still, employers: COME ON! Why won't you hire me (Tower Records, I'm looking in your direction... really, I literally am).  Looks like I'm gonna be gone July 8-20 on vacation. I'm going to Seattle for some sort of family reunion. Then the family's planning to go on a road trip and hit Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Rocky Mountain, Arches, and Canyonlands National Parks. In addition, we'll probably visit Salt Lake City, Denver, and Idaho. Wow, I'm excited about this trip, though I hope that summer crowds don't get in the way. Exchange trip! We're leaving in 43 days (if I counted correctly)! Whoa I'm excited to go to Germany. Ich bin noch nicht zu Europa gewesen, so I'm super-excited about this. Then they're coming here in September! Whoa, that's gonna be great! I still have to buy my summer reading books. And I only have 4 weeks to read them! Whew, too much excitement in store for me! OMG there's more!  I Love the 90s  premieres July 12 on VH1! AAAAH I need to go back to my dull existence as a summertime student... I think I'll sleep.

      It's weird how I'm always right, even when I don't think I'm right.  I don't want to romanticize my past, because I know it isn't perfect, but remember when I was wilder and more willing to do crazy and disgusting things? I want to be like that. I don't know why I'm so restrained and inhibited. I guess I'm angry or jealous at anyone who steals the spotlight from me. Whenever someone does something noteworthy or something that gets them attention, I always think, "I can do that." But I don't think I want the spotlight as much as them. Whenever I get an award or something, I always downplay it. So I must be humble, right? I need to be less humble and more assertive. Humbleness and living according to moral ideals can't make one happy, because it's just impractical--even impossible.   I jumped on my bed today. I forgot how fun that was.

      I just realized that other people's success doesn't motivate me, but does the opposite. I get discouraged! It's weird how my mind works. I guess I always want to be one of the very first to do something, but I don't want to take a risk with something that may fail, so I back out of being the first. Like being the first to get a job or get a license or listen to a band... or get a blog.  well today is just like every other day... wasting my time at the computer, listening to the same mix of songs. I made scrambled eggs this morning/midday for breakfast. This was the fourth time in the past week I made them. The eggs taste really good; I put hash browns in them. I'm so proud of myself for cooking good food. :)  I am not passionate about anything... why? I want to  love  something... like piano or guitar or running or surfing or working-- something ! I've been at home for 2 weeks straight and haven't even had the will to clean my room. I guess you can only find yourself and your true passions when you do something you don't really like. Or when you're with other people. Just TRY something. You'll be surprized how much of an experience you can have doing something mundane.

      Today is going just like every other day for the last 2 weeks since school ended. I woke up at 11 am; it seems that I'm waking up later and later as vacation progresses. I usually actually wake up around 9 but decide to just stay in bed... what a great life! After having my usual pop tarts for breakfast, I came up to my room, where I am trying to organize all my school papers, a task I've been too lazy to start for months. What's great about summer is that you get to do a lot of thinking when there are no pressing deadlines or anything. I've had so many great ideas over the past few weeks, but what's tragic is that so many of them are forgotten before I can write them down. Imagine how much greater the world would be if people never forgot great ideas they have. I don't think I've been myself lately. Not just lately as in the past few weeks or months, but years. Probably ever since I got to high school. I don't remember ever feeling truly comfortable. I haven't  really  laughed with my "friends" in high school. This past year, I felt like an emotional wreck all the time, sometimes just angry at everything around me, but mostly too tired to care about anything. I've noticed that I'm usually angriest during the afternoon. I've realized that the afternoon just isn't my time of day. I'm more of a middle-of-the-night person. That's when I am the most productive, when there are no distractions, and when no one else is working. I guess then that I must love solitude and being away from people. That makes perfect sense. I absolutely hate waiting in long lines for anything, I hate crowded movie theaters-I love seeing movies midday on a weekday- and I guess I love going anywhere during the off-season. I don't necessarily think I'm antisocial, I just think that I don't like having to compete with a buncha other people to get my message out. I can just see myself as the guy working behind the scenes who does the most important work but gets no credit. Anyway, I want to revisit the post that got deleted. I was musing on how I hate those people who seem to do everything - do everything well, I might add - with a smile on their face and no sign of stress. Many people seem to fit into this category. Everything seems to be perfect for them. They're smart, athletic, charismatic, hard-working, and funny, and they never seem to get tired. ARGH how I wish I could be more like that. I guess I don't despise them as much as I envy them--or should I say the idealized image they project. I'm sure that no one, no matter how "talented" (i'll comment on this word later) can really be that perfect. Deep down they've got to be enduring stress and pressure just like the rest of us. They just have some driving motivation that keeps them going through the inevitable obstacles. So I guess we all need to find that one thing that keeps us going. I don't think I've found mine. That's why I'm so lazy and why I'm getting so disorganized. Heck, people might think that  I'm  one of those perfect people. Hah! I may be smart and seemingly organized, but I definitely have a lot of flaws. Which brings me to "talent." I don't think that those perfect people are "talented"; in fact, they may be the opposite. See, I think talent is not memorizing and regurgitating information or working until you're exhausted. Talent is being able to discover something or produce something original, like a song, a work or art, or just a good idea. Talented people are those who try to get closer to the meaning of life (I know it sounds cliche). I believe that there are so many things to discover in the world--the infinite ways that everything is related to everything else. Even the slightest change can produce great effects. That's why I believe that, in everything in life, one must look at the details to produce truly great results. That just reminds me of that volkswagen commercial, where someone picks up something for someone else, then the second person helps out another person, who helps out someone else, and so on. The little things in life are what make it memorable. Those perfect people are working so hard that life is just gonna pass them by.  This isn't all. Trust me, I've got more rant to come...

      OK I started this blog a few days ago, but something was up w/ my comp, so here's my first (technically second) post that should have been up a while ago:  Welcome to my new blog. I'm actually annoyed- no, pissed- because I just wrote a HUGE first entry and my computer just closed the window before I could post it. I basically listed all my goals for the summer, and talked about my experiences for these first days of vacation. But I'll get back to those later, because I want to post before my computer crashes or whatever again. Damn, why can't I have a reliable computer!
