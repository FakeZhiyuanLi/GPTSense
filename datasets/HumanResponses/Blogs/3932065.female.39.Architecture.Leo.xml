      So I'm at PF Chang's having drinks and appetizers with the girls from work.  I regale my story about the concert last night and how much fun I had.  And then, Kerri and Kirsten both look at me sideways and say that they can't imagine me being wild, because I seem so conservative. (!!!) Is this  me  they are talking bout? I totally choked on my lettuce wrap.  Conservative?

      Well, Lit rocked. It was so fun :) My girlfriend cancelled last minute, so I ended up going with my friend Chris.  Kevin told him to protect me (love that xoxo). He rescued my shoe from the center of the mosh pit - so I'm thinking he fulfulled his duty.   Highlight #1 - Chris: Look, I think that's Uma Thurman's little sister.  Me: Stacy? ...I realized that it was Stacy and Bev, the girls I sold my Incubus tickets to. This sent me into fits of laughter, cuz I thought they'd be suprised to see that I was a grown-up when I delivered the tickets, but they were the ones acting like grown-ups last night. Lighten up girls, please. Highlight #2 - Chris tried to get Lit to do an encore by saying "you aren't done yet you free concert bitches." I don't think they heard cuz they didn't come back. Anyway, my calves are  killing  me.  I could use some sealegs today. Did I mention that it rocked?

      Yesterday I was whipped tired and then got hit with one of those "sudden and inexplicable caffiene crashes". I was out of it from 5 til 9 pm - I did my best to pull myself out of it, but it was hard.  I stayed up til 11 because Queer Eye was on. I really love that show. Anyway, I couldn't get to sleep after that. I waited and waited for sleep to come.  And then, just when I was about to find my way to the sandman (I won't name names here cuz that's not my thing) I got a hard ass kick to the shin. The sandman skittered away and I was left wondering if he was ever near in the first place.  No worries for me though. I cheered myself up by sharing some doritos with my dog this morning. He loves carbs, just like me :)

      The titles of my posts in purple are external links.  However, when I logged on yesterday, my purple links had turned yeller (chicken ass titles). We all know I'm none too computer savvy - I have no flippin clue how to get them back to purple. Hell, maybe they'll revert back by themselves.  I am going to be super patient. I will sit and watch and wait for something to happen on its own. If you're curious (and I so hope you are) please don't let the yellers fool you. K thx bye.

      I wandered on down to the Nevada Museum of Art to view the video installation of Marco Brambilla's HalfLife.  Disturbing.  The link tells the story better than I can :)  I also visited the Maynard Dixon exhibit: Space Silent Spirit. His work deals primarily with native Indians and the landscape of the west. Almost all of the drawings in the collection are graphite and white pencil on neutral paper, which makes for a nice effect.  I found his compositions to be wonderful in their simplicity.  Also enjoyable were his paintings of Carson City, Virginia City, and the mountain scenes of Nevada.

      I was out driving today and I pulled up next to this really trick 1968 Camaro. The guy's license plate was a little obvious "68CONVT" ...I mean, you can see that it's a convertible please, because the top was down.  Anyway, I stared straight ahead...but could hear that low throaty rumble next to me.  Suddenly, I felt tears prickling in my eyes.  It dawned on me that I was suffering from the   maliblues.  What will happen at Hot August Nights?? Those muscle cars cruise nightly and rev and rev and rev.  I'm thinking I should get a medical bracelet with  maliblues  engraved on it. If I faint, the paramedics will know to get me into a 1965 - pronto.

      When I first heard my friend Sheri say the words, "I'm going to ride it out (Atkins diet)...I'm waiting for all carbs, all the time"  I laughed and laughed. But then, I realized she was on to something.  Soon after, I discovered that an overcommitted daily schedule, paired with a steady diet of Starbucks, chocolate, and Taco Bell was the ticket to weight loss success.  What is the secret to all of this? The pure flow of adrenaline combined with a high-carb diet contributes (somehow) to that almost perfect weight loss rate of a pound a week.  It works for me, it can work for you too!! Scheduled to be in two places at the same time? Count on saying goodbye to another 1/4 to 1/2 pound. This is like a dream come true! And let me just be clear..I don't need any backlash from the Atkins loving community. I know it works too. But for God's sake   let them eat cake.

      I swear, just one more post about Lit--then I'll hush up and get on with my life (fib).&nbsp; I picked up their self-titled album yesterday. Once again I was reminded of how much I enjoy their self-deprecating tongue in cheek lyrics--coupled with that beat that makes Lit...well, Lit.&nbsp; My my, looks like they were right.

      Last night my friend Shari said, "Isn't it a special day when you realize that you only shaved one leg in the shower?" Other girlfriends readily agreed with her. I&nbsp;must say I felt left out of this "special day" group.&nbsp;&nbsp;The best I've done is wash my face with shampoo. Whatever. &nbsp;

      These are examples of work done by Walter Algarin, of Eclectic Metal Design, Inc. for the Big Brothers Big Sisters 2004 Showcase House.&nbsp; The vine theme was carried throughout the home's interior and exterior.&nbsp; I will be designing iron railings with inset panels, a dining room table base, sink base and mirror frame--as well as integrating iron and stone&nbsp;(fireplace) &nbsp;for my clients in Lake Tahoe.&nbsp; Walt&nbsp;is a great guy and a tremendous talent. It was fun to walk the jobsite with him, getting all&nbsp;right-brained together ;) &nbsp;Time for me to sit at the drafting table...come up with something cool, and hopefully (crossing fingers) sell the job to my client.&nbsp; If you can afford the best, why not?

      Lit is performing a free concert at the Harrah's plaza in downtown Reno. Yay for that! I don't think I've been this excited since I procured a guitar pick from the sound guy at the KISS concert. And dammit, I'm going to party til it's my birthday.

      For the last week or so, I constantly see license plates like "110 PLZ", "439 PXX", "730 PXU" more "PLZ" and so on.  What is up with that? It's nagging at me, like a little reminder of something I need to do, but can't quite grasp what it is.  Plus, ewww!! I saw a plate that said: "IT  L  DU". How lame can you possibly get?

      My blog has a "willing to leave comment" population of next to none.  Can you help? I think I need advice in the "how to improve your blogging relationships" arena.  Am I too blonde for this? Too boring? Too self-absorbed? Have I been shunned because I was once scolded by a clown?    My readers may well be mute. No worries. Comments a'la Helen Keller style (waaa waaa)are welcome. I'll take what I can get. Just so you know, that doesn't mean I'm a Friday free spin Sally.   Yours truly,  Down in Reno

      Anybody out there have some favorite lyrics? Just looking for a line or two, not the whole song ;) Here's a few of mine:  Someone please think for me, I can't bear to. ~Stone Temple Pilots  You need eyes in the back of your head, and a spine with a built-in bed. ~Badly Drawn Boy  Mr. Cabdriver, fuck you. I'm a survivor. ~Lenny Kravitz

      Thought I'd get a head start on my History of Interiors class that starts in two weeks. Why? Because the instructor is a Nazi, and she'll take us all to task once it begins. So, I headed to the downtown library to check out a bunch of books.  Fought the traffic to get down there, then couldn't park anywhere because of Hot August Nights.  I finally get a parking space, throw some change in the meter and head over to the library.  "Hey baby, how's it going??!" from a car rushing by.  Do you really care? How bout you don't hit me, and I'll pretend you don't exist. Thanks.  Get to the library and it's flippin closed for the next two weeks for staff training. What the hell? Gaaaaaaa. I hate being denied :( I'm not spoiled. I'm not I'm not I'm not.

      I just finished reading "The Pursuit of Alice Thrift" by Elinor Lipman.  What a great read :) It was hilarious - definitely had me laughing aloud (laughing is allowed too).  For a random pick at the library, I hit pay dirt. I'm heading back today to see if any of her other novels are available.  Yay.

I'm staying away from that Hat chick though.  She looks like she could (and would) kick my ass in a heartbeat. Nice blog Martyjohns :)

      Strung out Thom failed horribly on tonight's episode of Queer Eye. I mean, what the hell? Nobody wants to live in a bluish-purplish-grey apartment. Gaaaaa. Place looked like  crap .  Carson dressed Al the garbage man in a light-weight merino (wool) sweater, under a wool suit jacket - this, when he's off to impress his boss with his itty bitty knowledge of wine and cheese. Can you say sweat machine?  Thank you Ted for pouring Mt. Veeder cabernet. That's the only reason I'm coming back next week dammit.  p.s. Get bent Thom. K bye

      We watched Secret Window last night.  It was so worth seeing Johnny Depp looking completely disheveled with bedhead to die for. Add in him eating doritos for breakfast  and  toying with a slinky....well, that was all I needed.  He is so hot.  (Kevin: he's so what?......Me: so hot.....Kevin: he's a bum) Thanks Les, for the movie  and  the slinky. And yes, I'm playing with it :)
