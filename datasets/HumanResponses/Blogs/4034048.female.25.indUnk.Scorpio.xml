      I love my husband, I do.  He's the father of my son, he loves me.  But there are times that all I want to do is find some guy (ok, and or girl) I don't know and probably wouldn't ever see again and just have wild, screaming sex until I can hardly walk.  I know it's horrible.  I just miss being single sometimes, knowing that most likely Perry is the last man I will ever sleep with.  I like variety, new things, new people and he's pretty set in his ways when it comes to our sex life.  I hate to say this, but he just doesn't excite me the way he did when we were first married.  I guess that it's just gotten predictable, boring.  It feels more like work.

      Somewhere between mapping out my life in high school and now I have lost my sense of self.&nbsp; In high school I knew who I was, the overweight, supershy really smart girl.&nbsp; I had planned to become the still a little shy, slender supersmart writer who totally wows all her classmates at the 10 year reunion.&nbsp; I've got three years to go, and from where I'm sitting at the moment, it's not looking too good.  I suppose I could be considered lucky because I don't hate my job, but it isn't very challenging.&nbsp; I cook in a retirment community so it's&nbsp;the same things over and over and over again.&nbsp; There are people who as soon as I hear their names I know exactly what they will order.&nbsp; Ok, so it's kind of cool to be connected to them like that, to know who prefers white bread, who wants oatmeal 7 days a week, who will send the plate back if they even suspect you might have tried to put vegetables on it, but I'd rather be out front, working with them on&nbsp;a day to day basis, knowing who's kids never come to visit, who the comedians the drama queens are.&nbsp; I've been passed over for promotions twice and nearly left after the second time, but I'm, well, scared.&nbsp; I know I'm a good cook, I'm not so sure I'd be good at anything else.  I know I used to have a quiet kind of confidence.&nbsp; I didn't brag about my achievements, but I knew I did well at most things I tried, and I was content.&nbsp; Somehow I have become horribly needy, craving reassurance and praise, mabye because I never hear anyone say I do a good job anymore.&nbsp; It makes me wonder if I'm deluding myself into thinking that I'm a hard worker.&nbsp; Does everyone give up days off--precious time with a new infant who is changing daily--to cover for coworkers just so their supervisors don't have to come in for one day of their vacation?&nbsp; Does everyone bust their butts to make sure the workplace is clean and ready for the next person's shift?&nbsp; Maybe I am just a slacker like so many others in my generation, despite my best intentions of being a hardworking, nose to the grindstone kind of person.&nbsp;   I don't know.&nbsp; I am starting to look for a new job though, something where I can put my education and natural skills to good use.&nbsp; I have a very soft spot for elderly people, and for teenagers in trouble.&nbsp; Hopefully, I'll be able to find something soon, even though it will be hard to leave my current job since I love all of the residents of the buildings I work in.

      Did you know that condoms are not as fail proof as safe sex advocates would like for you to believe?  My son is just now 3 1/2 months old and will have a little brother or sister next April.  They'll be less than a year apart.  I honestly don't know if I should laugh or cry.  I'm scared to death because we're so deep in debt, and my family is going to have a fit, but I'm excited too.  I know it will be tough to be pregnant with an infant, and really hard to have a newborn and a toddler at the same time, but I love being a mom.   I'd kind of like to have a girl this time.  If my mom has a granddaughter maybe she won't kill me for getting pregnant again son soon, even though it was a complete accident.
