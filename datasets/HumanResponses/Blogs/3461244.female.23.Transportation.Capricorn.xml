      So I've decided to conform and Make a blog of my own, so I can get out all of the useless crap that's in my head.   Last night I had buisness meeting with the managment team for Marion Berg, which I am part of, aswell as backign vocals. It was a drunken good old time. Christian who is also in the Crawling Kingsnakes is funny as hell. He is the Blues master..Seriously, "Ain't nobody leaves dis place, without singing da blues" but he's this crazy white dude with fuckin awesome hair, who lunges himself around the room like he's weapon of mass destruction. He has fuckin style, he looks like he's straight off the set of 'A clockwerk Orange'. Then there's Marion's Husband Clayton, who is equally as crazy and full of tons of useless information. And then there's Jack, he's always around, causing problems, making people say things they shouldn't, making people forget what they're saying.. Oh that Mr. Daniels always brings out the best in us all:) Anyways we had some heated debates about music, since Christian basically hates everythign except The Blues, he's very close minded when it comes to other genre's. I can't fuckin stand it when people who are into one certian genre of music, call everythign else crap, most times even before they give it a chance. I fuckin hate that. I love all forms of music, even the most unusual stuff, even pop crap.. If i can feel it then I like it..I'm not about to pretend I don't like somethign when I do, just to impress someone either, I'm over the whole " I need to like everythign they like" stage. Plain and simple, I don't give a fuck, I like what I like, so fuck off! Call me stupid, call me tasteless, I don't care, I'm not going to have some idiot who refuses to listen to certain music becuase It's not what they usually  listen to. And then have them turn around and tell me I have no fuckin taste becuase I don't like somethign they listen too, I respect, and give it a fair chance, But if i dont like something it doesn't mean that I have no taste! Fuck.... Who gives a fuckin shit if I like Eric Clapton, Harry Connick Jr., or fuck even Justin Timberlake, None of which I own an album of, oh wait I do have Eric's unplugged, but I stole it from dad years ago..I listen to alot of mellow stuff at work becuase my coworkers go crazy when the edge or Q is on, so i isten to whatever they want cause quite frankly, I think it's nice sometime sto have a change in style, and listen to some stuff I may never have listened to before..Like that new Tal Bachman song.. He's great, never would have heard it, if it wasn't for easyrock fm..The are endless possibilities when it comes to music, so if you just give it a chance you may just find that diamond in the ruff..cheers,
