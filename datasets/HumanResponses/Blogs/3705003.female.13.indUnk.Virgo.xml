      Yo. It's officially 9:35 am. The pool hasn't opened yet and I  can't believe I'm up this early during Summer . This morning I woke up and wasn't hungry. It's too early to even THINK about food. I came down to the living room and here I am on the computer. Well, nobody is online as usual. Where is everybody? Katie is at camp (as usual). Taylor is at camp. Katie Beth is at camp. Macaira is probably home and unpacking from Asbury Hills. Same with Meghan. I know Edward is on a trip to West Virginia or s/t. I have no idea what the other boys with AIM and AOL are doing. Besides, the only ones who have gotten online the entire summer are Arian and Stephen, and I don't talk to them usually. They're probably on a trip or hanging around the neighborhood burning stuff.  Robin still thinks Keith likes her. Like, why would he like her? No offense, but she isn't very likable. Even by people like Keith. Maybe Keith likes her type, but I don't think anybody would. (Again, no offense!) She asked Keith if he liked her at the spring dance, and he said "I don't know" and she came up to me like "OMG! I asked Keith if he liked me and he said that he didn't know! I knew he liked me!" You can sooooo tell she likes him. Or maybe she is just so excited to actually have someone like her besides Will and Sam in 5th grade. (Presently, Will claims he was dared and paid to got out with Robin by Matt, and Sam gets grossed out if you mention him going out with her) Maybe they did it because no other girl liked them.. IDK. Anyway, Robin was spending the night with me that night after the dance and she was like "I might go out with Keith if he asks me. I mean, not this year at least. But if he gets hot next year then maybe (yeah Keith'll get hot. And I have cucumbers growing out of my ears)." and we were in the same car with my dad! And she was up front! She asked me if she could sit up front! WITH MY DAD! How weird is that? So I sat in back, kind of weirded out that she was up front.  Anyway, I can't wait until I get a cell phone. Everyone that has a cell phone (the people I talk to from Sneed) are like "BbL. Call the cell!" in their away messages. I want to do that! My cell phone is gonna be soooo awesome. It's a Cingular flip phone and it has a camera!! It's sooo awesome!!!!  Ew. There are these weird old guys playing golf near my house. They look so weird. One is wearing jeans and an old gray shirt. The others are wearing long shorts and un-tucked polo shirts. At least they have those golf spikes on. One guy I saw playing was wearing regular shoes.  My dad is listening to Mike Gallagher on the radio in here. They're talking about pornography on the web and nudist camps and stuff. They're trying to ban it and are calling it sick. Of course it is!! I mean, kids going on the web and looking at porn? Ew! The boys in my class do it (so I've heard) and I think that's totally gross. And the nudist camps Mike is talking about are the kind with kids. Like 11 year old boys and girls NAKED. SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ewwwww!!!!!!!!!!!! They SHOULD be banned. Ugh. Gross. Well, It's 9:58 and almost 10, then an hour until I go to the pool, so I'll write more when I get back or something. Love you!!

      Well, I was bored so here I am posting more blog. I want to make this a pretty long one so I won't be bored anymore and by the time I finish I can go to sleep. If I went to sleep now I'd feel like such a dork and it would make tonight seem like a school night (ick).  Well, since I last posted I have new news. Isn't that weird? I mean, news is obviously new, but mine is *newly new* so that makes it new news. Odd. Anyway, my "new news" is that...I'm getting a cell phone! *gasp* omg omg omg!! I've been waiting for *FoReVeR* to get a cell phone! I'm getting one finally!! How exciting! I'm watching Forensic Files. It's about this girl that got raped and killed. It's very interesting. Well, I wanna watch it an I'm tired of typing so I'll talk to you tomorrow. Love you!!

      OMG I'm not going to Ycamp next session after all! Wanna know why?! It was like way exspensive since I'm not a member so my dad was like "You can go to camp or get a motorized scooter" and I was like "I want both" and he was like "Well, camp costs more" and so I was like "I'm not a fan of getting up early anyway" so I'm getting a scooter yay!! I suppose the only reason I wanted to go to camp anyway was to be with KT and Taylor and KTB and meet Lacy and a few of their ppl they know. Plus I get bored. But I'm planning on calling Merritt or Rachel and being like "hey wanna come over yea I haven't seen you in a while! Wanna come swim anyway?!" and they'll want to come. I miss them. They used to be my bests. I miss them sooooooo much!! I'm gonna call them tomorrow or s/t and maybe they can come with me to OCC for the pool party yay!! Well today I got up at noon and I went swimming!! I played with this girl named Katherine and then she left and Lindsay and Beth and Adriana came to the pool!! So I kinda hung out with them while they learned to do back dives!! I didn't do one b/c I'd be SUCH a copy cat and maybe annoying them. So I was like cool! and stuff like that!! I wanna see a movie. Well gotta go!! Love you!!

      Just got my CPU back from Compuforce today. This is the second time this month we had to take the darn thing down there. I couldn't IM, I couldn't update my stories on the TFB, I couldn't update this, heck.. I couldn't do anything! Anyway, it's Monday night, 5 days until the 4th of July!! Yay! This year I'm spending the 3rd and 4th of July at OCC (Oakdale Country Club). I wish I was going to Santee again this year. It was so fun last year! That day we rode around on jet skiis and we went tubing and kneeboarding and water skiing and crap. That was awesome. We spent the morning driving the Pontune boat down at Alligator Alley, then went to Scarbourough's for lunch, then we borrowed the Marsh's jet skiis and I drove one down to the Sand Bar. Then we went back to the house and there was this HUGE box of fireworks and we did those off the dock. This guy named Wade came over and brought some with his dad. We had a cook-out and did more fireworks and then went to sleep. Then the next morning we went to Rusty's house (one of the neighbors) and they have a floating trampoline in the water. I jumped on that with Ellis, Alyssa, and this really fat girl who lived down the street. I pretending to accidently push her off so we could jump. Then I let her plop around up there and try to jump while me, Ellis, and Alyssa swam back to the shore and went inside to eat lunch. (we only ditched her because she was so mean) Then we shot paintballs at a tree with Earle's paintball gun and jumped off the dock and went fishing. Then three days later we went home. Good times.  Anyway, I can't go this year b/c we have "other things to do". Parent language for "your mother and I are going to the pool party at the club and you're coming too". That's okay b/c it'll be fun at the club. I hope Stephen doesn't come. He'd ruin it b/c he'd be mean to me. Especially if he brought a friend or s/t. That would be bad. But I'm gonna bring Taylor or Katie or someone so that'll be cool.  I'm having my birthday party this year at OCC. Me and Katie might have one together since our birthdays are so close. (4 days, and I'm older!!) It's gonna be fun!! Today it was rainy and around 8:40 or so I rode my bike down the road and three dogs chased me and tried to bite me. I got really scared and was screaming and stuff. (hey you'd be scared too) I finally stopped and stopped moving and they left me alone so I rode my bike back home and my dad came out and took me inside. He said he's gonna call Animal Control. Cool.  I don't like those dogs. I only like Scooter. He's the coolest. Oh yeah we saw some chihuahuas at the pet shop and I saw one I really liked. It was sooo cute but bigger than the one I imaginied. Anyway, it was like $350 so we're gonna look for a better deal and anyway, those dogs are from puppy mills.  Puppy mills are so nasty. I hate them. I want to kill the mofos who work at them and stuff. It's evil and cruel. I'm a total animal lover.  I also love Sean Hannity. He's the coolest republican out there, besides Bill O'Reilly and George Bush and Dick Chaney and Ronald Reagan (RIP!!). =) Anyway, Republicans are cool and I'm proud to be one. Go elephants! lol Vote Bush!!  Well I'm Daria obsessed right now. I recorded like, 20 episodes of Daria on DVR. That's such a funny show. =) Well I'm tired so bye!! Love you!!

      It's still Tuesday.  I just watched Summerland and the Real World (new episodes).  Today after I did the last blog, I went to the pool and Charlotte, Bailey, and that girl I told you about was there. The girl's name was Savannah.  Anyway, we dove and played cheerleading and the color game. We played TV and played with the "water bombs". It was tiring and very boring at times. Savannah didn't know how to swim very well, so I tried to teach and her and she was HORRIBLE. She couldn't keep her head out of the water and couldn't even kick her feet the right way. I felt really bad for her and tried to help her as much as I could, but I told her that I would have to help her again on Saturday.  Bailey tried diving again, and she did really badly. I told her to keep working on it.  I got sunburnt on my face a little. That hurt. Charlotte kept getting on my back and trying to jump over my head. I had to push her off my shoulders once.  I think she wants to flip and stuff like that, so I told her to ask her parents if she could take gymnastics at Freedom Florence. She ran over to her grandpa and asked right away and he said he'd think about it.  Bailey heard us talking about it and she asked me if I thought she'd be a good gymnast. I said I didn't know. Then she told me she wanted to be a cheerleader and asked if I thought she'd get on the top of the pyramid. I said maybe. So she asked her mom if she could take gymnastics and her mom said she'd think about it.  These two kids were making fun of one of the lifeguards named Keely. She's really overweight, but really nice so I felt bad for her. I was glad she didn't hear them making fun of her.  She went up to dive and I heard them say "She's gonna take out half the water in the pool!" I almost punched them. I've heard that too many times for it not to take any effect, and it wasn't even directed at me this time.  Well, I'm tired so I'm gonna go to sleep. Good night!! =)

      My second day with the blog. I've got to add this to my profile so people can see it.  Yesterday I went to the pool and these little kids were hanging all over me. There was a girl named Bailey and she was 7 and sort of chubby, there was a girl named Charlotte who was 5 and really tan, and there was another girl I didn't really know but she had to go so I don't really care. They had these "water bombs" which were really water gun refills. They poured them over my head and I had to "blow up". Just to make them happy I jumped up in the air and said "boom!" really loud. They thought that was fun so I just did it cause nobody else was there. Bailey was kind of jealous that Charlotte kept getting on my back and stuff, so she kept holding onto me and it was really annoying. The third girl I didn't know left so it was me and those two in the pool. They wanted to play the color game where you flip people if they guess your color, so I did. They did all sorts of things besides colors like Favorite Sandwhich and Favorite Soda and stuff. Bailey chose the same things every time; Ham and Cheese and Pepsi. It was pretty predictable and I got flipped on the first try every time.  Bailey is the kind of kid who likes to be in charge, and she's very bossy. But luckily, Charlotte is not the kind of kid to listen to Bailey's commands. I think Bailey likes to be the oldest one, so she was kind of mean to Charlotte and wanted to boss her around and make it seem like I liked her better than Charlotte. Personally, I don't really like either of them that much, but they're okay, yet at the same time really annoying. For instance, they wanted to play cheerleading, so I had to lift them up and stuff. It was okay when Bailey and I lifted Charlotte, since Charlotte is 5 years old and pretty skinny, and we could throw her up and catch her and that was okay. But when it came time for Charlotte and I to lift Bailey, we couldn't do it. I mean, I could lift her up, but Charlotte, being so small, couldn't lift Bailey, who is probably around 80 or 85 pounds.  I was throwing Charlotte up into the air and Bailey came over and was like "Oh, that looks cool! Can you do that to me?" she asked. I hated to tell her I couldn't lift her up out of the water much less throw her up and catch her. But I tried, and I said I wasn't strong enough and it was probably because Charlotte was alot younger than her. (far from the truth)  Then I started diving off the diving board and we were in the deep end and they begged me to teach them to dive. Charlotte was hanging all over me and pushing me under because she wanted to sit on my shoulders.  I taught them to dive, and Charlotte was doing alot better than Bailey, but she chickened out and just watched Bailey keep trying.  By the time Charlotte left and the pool was about to close, Bailey could dive okay off the diving board. I felt really accomplished, and I know she did too. Her mom thanked me and I rode my bike back to my house.  I watched 14 episodes of Daria and an old episode of Quintuplets that I recorded on DVR last night. Then I watched an old episode of Summerland and went to sleep.   I woke up today and got online and nobody was on, as usual. I think Macaira and Meghan are at Asbury Hills, and Katie Beth, Katie, and Taylor are at Ycamp. I don't know about what Wyatt, Arian, Stephen, and Edward are doing. They're probably on a trip or something. Robin is probably at her dad's imaginary house in Fayetteville or something. Katie told me Robin wore my shoes (that she took home (cough cough *STOLE* cough cough) without asking from my house) to the Y. I was so mad. I'm gonna call that loser and tell her to bring me back my shoes and ask her why she stole them and then wore them.   I'm gonna go back to the pool today since it's sunny and there's nothing else to do. I hope somebody is there that I can talk to. Like Lindsay and Beth or Frances. I saw Hannah Sprenger there a few times. I was in her class in 4-k and 5-k and I want to ask her if she remembers me. I think she does because she waved at me at the pool on Saturday. It may have been because I was looking at her. (I was about to go over and say hi) But she left so oh well. She had a pretty bathing suit and was really tan.  I don't like tanning that much. I mean, my mom tanned A LOT when she was a teenager, and now she has freckles all over and had skin cancer (it's cleared now). But it's strictly fake tanning for me. No, not tanning beds. That's even worse. I mean, just going once can increase your chances of skin cancer by like, 53% or something. Then if you tan without any sunscreen on (I mean like NO sunscreen not even SPF 5) then that's almost as bad as tanning beds if you do it alot. I put SPF 50 on my shoulders and face. That's where I burn alot. Burning can increase chances of skin cancer too. I'm not pale or anything, though. I look ghostly during winter. Tanning is pretty, but too much and it could be deadly. You can have discolored and misshapen moles, too. That's not pretty. And freckles all over your legs and arms when you're older isn't worth it. Losing your hair thanks to chemo isn't either.   Gah I'm writing alot. Okay, I'm going to go swimming now. Bye!!

      My first blog.. sorry I don't have anything to say. I'll tell you about my day, (a great icebreaker) and we'll sort of go from there!  Today I woke up and I turned on my TV and the cable was messed up. There was "dead air" on every channel and then I went to my recorded list (only people with Digital Cable and DVR will know what this is) and tried to watch Daria (only The-N veiwers will know what this is) and there was no sound. Lovely, eh?  Then I went downstairs and my mom was home from work! (she's a nurse and works night shift usually) So I asked if she wanted to go to the beach Tuesday for the day and she said yes, so I guess we're going to the beach tomorrow!  Next I went upstairs and watched the Legally Blonde DVD on my PS2. After that I had lunch (barbecue chicken!! YuM!!) and I watched Legally Blonde 2. Reese Witherspoon is too cool! But I seriously have my doubts that her real name is Reese Witherspoon. It sounds very far-fetched.  After watching the LB movies, I really wanted a chiuahuah. I mean, I know I have Scooter, and dachshunds really are the cutest dogs ever, but I want my own little dog I can carry in a purse!! lol  Well after I watched the movies I read all my YM magazines and came downstairs and made this blog. I got online and checked to see if anyone was on. SURPRISE!! Nobody was on. Ugh! Everyone is at camps and stuff. I'm going to Ycamp for the next session. I'm tired of everyone else going and me being stuck home. So I'm gonna go.  I'm not so bored now that I'm writing this.  Well, I'm gonna go watching Finding Nemo or something and see if the cable is up. Cya!!

      It's 2:14 AM on Thursday morning. I can't sleep since the nightmares are in my bed. Chrissy wasn't supposed to spend the night, just stay late and sleep while our parents are out. (They are such loons) But when Chrissy's mummy came back to take Chrissy home, Chrissy and Kinsey cried for Chrissy to stay. They really have become good friends. Anyway, they're sleeping in my bed while I sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag. It's really annoying. I'd hoped they'd both cry to go home so their mummies would have to come get them, but they fell asleep. Maybe because my bed is so comfy. Maybe I'll convince them to sleep in my sleeping bag so I can get a proper rest so I can handle them at the library tomorrow. They're going to get books and I hope to dear God that there's a story reading time or something. I need a break from the Double Trouble. Anyway, made hot tea. Drank it. Made more hot tea. Made them milky pops (hot milk drink) since they got up all fussy a minute ago. They collapsed on the bed again, but not on the sleeping bag like I'd wanted them to. I've been reading too much Georgia Nicolson. Just got finished reading "Knocked Out By My Nunga Nungas". Welllll I read the first one "Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging" last year, then when Katie and I went to the bookstore, we found the ALL the Georgia books, MINUS the second one. ("On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of A Sex God") Well, the 5-year-old nightmares are up and at it again. Milky pops here we come!   They escaped from their beds! I had to rescue them from the golf course! More joy. Sacre bloody bleu (french!) UGH I HATE THEM! Sorry, I don't. Yea, I do. Anyway, gotta go get some sleep. More in the morning! Cheers.

      Once upon a time, there was a very bored girl named Lauren. She had two annoying little cousins named Kinsey and Chrissy. They were both five, and very hyper. They were annoying Lauren so very much she took them outside to let them feed the ducks. Instead of feeding the ducks, Kinsey pushed Chrissy into the lake and and Chrissy pulled Kinsey in. They both swam away from Lauren and went to swim with the disgruntled "duckie-wuckies", as they affectionatley called them. Cousin Lauren had to jump into the lake to get them out. She tempted them with a bubble bath and a pizza. So cousin Lauren, who was home alone since her mother and father were out with Chrissy's mummy and Kinsey's mummy was taking Kinsey's baby sister to Myrtle Beach to stay with her grandparents, had to drag the two little girls into the house, bathe them, help them change into their nighties they brought to spend the night in, and order a pizza with the money Lauren's daddy left them. Lauren put the children's clothes in the dryer. Then Lauren sat the two little 5 year old nightmares on a bed made of lots of blankets and pillows in the living room and turned on Nickelodeon while she fixed sodas for them. So the pizza came and Lauren and the two little girls ate pizza and drank Coke. Then the two little girls fetched their swimming suits and they all went swimming. They terrorized the kiddie pool. Well, I think Kinsey peed in it. Ew. Then they came back and Lauren is here writing this. The children are upstairs having a bath in their swimming things while Lauren relaxes. The little nightmares are calling to get out of the tub. Please hold...  Lauren dried them off and dried their hair, then put them in their nighties and sat them on the bed of blankets and pillows again. Then she heated up the leftover pizza and they are watching a video. What an awful day. Lauren is tired so she's going to eat pizza and drink coke with the nightmares.   THE END.

      It's 4:46. Lovely. Went to bed rather late last night. Or should I say this morning? It was 4am, alright? I woke up around 2 or so. I couldn't properly wake up since my bed was so fantastically comfortable. I lay there for a few minutes then made to turn on the TV, then nodded off again. Woke up, got bored. I came downstairs at 2:40, I suppose. Got online, put up an away message. Ate some grapes, watched TV. Bored again. Came downstairs,  watched more TV. Rang my grandmother to say hello. Good Lord, am I bored. Decided to go swimming. Changed my mind. I'm definantly not in the mood. Had a tea. Kinsey, my cousin, came to visit with her mummy Michelle, my cousin or something. Michelle left her here while she went to take the baby (Tiffany, my other cousin) to her grandparents. I'd rather not have a chatty little 5 year old around here on this sort of day, but oh well. Fed her a PB&J sandwhich and some milky pops (hot milk). She fell asleep on the couch with her dolls so I came to write this. She's awake now and watching PBS kids. Chrissy just came and the two of them keep attempting to lock each other in the closet and sneak outside. I turned on a movie and the two of them are entranced on a blanket in front of the TV. Now there are two chatty little 5 year old girls running around the house and sitting down for a moment to sip juice and watch their movie, then up again. I'll spray them with the hose if they bother me again. I'm serious.   Ugh, are they annoying. I'm going to let them feed the ducks in the lake for a bit. TTFN. -Lauren

      Today after I did that last post I hung around the house then went biking around the neighborhood and those mean dogs didn't chase me this time (thank God). Anyway, I came back and got online and SURPRISE! Nobody was on. Joy. Then I went upstairs and fed my cat some ham and then he threw it up on my bed. Gross. So I had to put on a new comforter. It's a down-feather comforter. Talk about soft. Anyway, then I watched loads of Daria and called Katie and she brought me money Katie Beth needed to give me or whatever. Then we talked on the porch for a bit and then she came inside and we started watching Shrek 2, but then we turned that off and watch Degrassi and Girls vs. Boys. Then we went to Books-A-Million and looked at loads of books, then we went to Joe Muggs Cafe and I got an Iced Cappuchino and a chocolate muffin, and Katie got a sugar cookie and an Iced Tea. I tried my cappuchino...GROSS! The lady that made it didn't know what she was doing! It was like black coffee with ice cubes in it. Sick. Anyway, I ended up getting an Iced Vanilla Latte or something and it tasted like a milk shake. Yum. So me and Katie read magazines on those comfy chairs and then we looked at more books and found some we had been wanting to find. Then we looked at the Yoga stuff and I debated getting a yoga mat, but I decided not to. Anyway, we took Katie home and then I watched the Real World reunion thingy that I recorded (since we got home at 11) and here I am writing this. I'm bored and tired, so nighty night! Love you!!

      Hey! Today I woke up at noon (as usual) and I got online and then I ate lunch and then I went to the pool, but nobody was there so I stayed for about two or three hours then I came home and now I'm writing this. I'm booooooooooooooored. =( There is nothing to do. Why does Katie go to camp for EVERY SINGLE SESSION?! It makes me mad that she's never home, and when she is, she's hanging out with people from ycamp! Ugh! Oh well. I'm gonna go. Cya!

      Hola... I gots bad news, and I gots good news. Well, actually, the bad news is good news and bad news (there are two sides to it). The new news is that I'm going to Sneed next year for 8th grade. OMG. I'll tell you why I'm leaving St. A's. For one thing, too much controversy. Okay, my class is very small for next year at St. A's. 16 people. Since 8 of those people are girls, we know each other's business. If two of us are in a fight, everyone is in the fight, choosing sides and stuff. Another reason is that I never meant to go to St. A's in the first place. After I left All Saints, I was gonna go to Moore, but I went to VBS at St. A's and my dad wanted me to go there for school for 5th grade. Believe me, I love all the girls in my class. We're good friends and they're all really cool, but alot of the girls at Sneed I've know ever since 3K, and I want to go there and see them and stuff. I really miss them, and I know I'll miss the St. A's girls, but I want to go to Sneed. Another reason is I'm really tired of St. A's. Basically everything about it. The uniforms, Friday Masses, the fact that there isn't chorus or anything, and just about everything else. I wish I could bring all my St. A's friends with me, but I've made my decision, and on July 28, I'm signing up and I'll be an official Squire. Don't worry, I'll come visit y'all on Feild Day, and we'll still be good friends and see each other at the movies and stuff. I'll still invite the girls to my birthday party!! I love each one of you so much. I'm gonna miss you more than anything. Never forget me, and to those going to WF, I'll see you there in a year!! To those who aren't going to WF, I'll call you up and see you at football games!! I love you!! Again, never forget me!! Wait.. who could forget a dork like me?! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even to the boys, I'll miss you too!! XoXo,-Lauren

      Aloha! It's FINALLY Saturday, June 3rd. Tonight is the long-awaited Pool Party and Fireworks Display at Oakdale! Yay! I can't wait! It's at 6 tonight! It's almost 5. =) Anyway, Katie and Taylor can't come with me. Oh well! Katie says she's coming to the Cook-Out with me tomorrow. I called Rachel, but she's not at home right now. I would've called my second oldest, bestest friend, but she's in Wateree. =( I guess I'll see Meghan there if she goes. (Which she most likely will) And I bet that Hannah Sprenger and her family would be there (Hannah and me were in the same class for 4K and 5K at All Saints.. she knows Mike who was in my class last year, I think), and a bunch of other people I've met at the pool, too. I hope Stephen doesn't come. It would be 10 times worse if he brought a friend! IMAGINE.. ugh. Anyway, I went major shopping yesterday. That was cool. I was taking this medicine for my sinuses, and I broke out in these bumps on my shoulders and stuff. They don't itch or hurt or anything, but they're really embarressing, especially if you're wearing a bathing suit! People will probably ask me what they are and I'll have to tell them. Ugh. =( Well, I'm gonna go get ready for the pool party! Love you!!

      Hola! It's Friday morning, 11:27 am. Some hairy teenage guy is mowing the lawn on the golf course, but he's zig-zagging all around and stuff. I think he's just playing around.  I saw "The Notebook" last night. It was soooo sad and sooooo sweet. It made me cry, because at the end, the two old people died together. Well, you'd have to see the movie to see what I'm talking about. I recommend it to every girl in the entire world. It's such a good movie.  Anyway, I'm going to the mall later today. I'm gonna go watch TV and go swimming. Sorry this is so short. I tried to post last night before I went to see the movie, but it wouldn't let me. Oh well!! Love you!!
