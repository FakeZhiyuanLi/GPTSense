      Okay, so there I am, looking allllllll cute and the guy I've been proposing to for years walks up and smiles at me.&nbsp; SMILES AT ME!!!&nbsp; Stupidly, in that boy way.&nbsp; I'm thinking I might just be getting married...I mean, it was a SMILE and AT ME!!!&nbsp; (...and if that prospect doesn't work out, I was proposed to by my daughter's classmate today...I'd have to have a seven year engagement until he's legal though...isn't that legal in Arkansas?&nbsp; Perhaps we'll just relocate...)&nbsp;

      this is unreal...the heat is so terrible that I'm looking FORWARD to going to work!&nbsp; It's just going to be hard to go to work when I have no skin.&nbsp; IT ALL MELTED OFF IN THIS HEAT!&nbsp; But besides the terrible lack of skin, life is unfolding nicely.&nbsp; Puerto Vallarta in just over a week...I sure wish the birth certificate that was promised no later than July 21st would get here!!!&nbsp; Ativan is my best friend right now.&nbsp; I still don't know how to ask for help in Spanish for the potential issue of the goat and I can't find slinky sexy strappy black shoes to go with the TODIEFOR black dress that was made just for hot Mexican nights (and men...).&nbsp; In spite of all this AND the first heated argument in over 4 years with the father of my children, I'm amazingly calm.&nbsp; Que sera, sera...thank you, you&nbsp;pharmaceutical wonder...

      Who knew that was possible?&nbsp; I'm a hand-me-down whore.&nbsp; If someone is giving it away, I'm imagining a whole new life for it.&nbsp; The question is, can I turn it into what I imagined???&nbsp; Who else could take a distributor cap from a '78 Bronco and turn it into a bundt pan???&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; I love the word Bundt.&nbsp; Funniest&nbsp;damn word.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundt, bundt, bundt.&nbsp; Ok, so now that the whore part is&nbsp;settled (and&nbsp;I have a shitload of stuff to unload out of the Suburban...), I'm off to lose my Sex In The City virginity.&nbsp; No, not a single episode, ever.&nbsp; But all that changes in the next few&nbsp;moments.&nbsp; Episodes 1-4 were available on DVD at the local video store and I'm gonna get up to speed.&nbsp; If I'm going to spend 5 days with the biggest fan of the show, I'm damn well going to know what she's talking about!!!&nbsp; Mexico in 15 days and all I'm worried about is&nbsp;not knowing the ins & outs of Sex&nbsp;In The&nbsp;City.&nbsp; It's nice to have a life with so few worries...I guess I should be worried that my French&nbsp;and Latin knowledge isn't going to help me ask the natives to get the goat off of my head...bummer...&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So...I've just learned that if my phone rings at 1:08 in the morning and the call is about a jail incident, I have an overwhelming desire to make egg salad and create my very own blog.&nbsp; And here I was starting to feel original!&nbsp; Belly full of egg salad and friend calmed down and blog created...check, check, check.&nbsp; Time to hit the sheets again so Psych2 doesn't seem to be in Greek again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Latin I might get...but Greek?&nbsp; No chance.

      So, no marriage but five days in one of the most gorgeous and hospitable places EVER ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET made me not sad about that fact.  I also discovered that red hair +  freckles makes native Puerto Vallartan men stop your cab to tell you that you are "muy bonita" and THAT I can tolerate just fine.  I'm planning my trip back and I haven't even been back a week!  All I have to say is that Le Kliffs is the BEST resaturant in the world and Yelapa is the best remote fishing village I've ever been to...well, the only...but still the best.  Especially via privately chartered sailboat with Pepe and Humberto as crew.  Those two I will share...but the waiter/water taxi driver with the earring at Yelapa's Marlin restaurant is MINE and MINE ALONE!!!  I.  WILL. RETURN. FOR. HIM.   Other news, missed the miniature mes like crazy and wonder if I'll ever be able to go on a vacation without them and not be constantly thinking, "oh the minis would love to be here, see this, taste this, etc, etc..."  Can I have an adult moment puh-leeeeze???  So, I just took a kazillion pictures so I can share a bit of it with them and I really do have lots of great "adult" memories of Mexico...the missing part was punctuated with fruity, slushy drinks, moonshine (raicilla at Yelapa), excessive sleeping and sunbathing as well as great dinners where I didn't have to remind any of the participants to "mind their manners" or "stop stabbing the (insert gender here) child with that utensil meant for eating".  Ahhhhh...the joys!
