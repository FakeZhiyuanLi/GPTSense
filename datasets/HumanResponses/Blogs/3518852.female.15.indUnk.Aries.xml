      i've been trying to figure out my "type" of guy for awhile now...just when i think i might have figured it out i think i'm wrong and i'm soo confused and i'm now wondering why guyz dont like me anymore...brandon was trying to think of some reason but i didnt really understand anything he was saying so if anyone could let me in on sumthing like how i've changed or if i'm a gurl that guyz have just started a conspiracy against..let me know....plez i'm beginning to become desperate oh ya and about the guy i said i liked his personality....i was talking to my mom about it earlier and she said i should push my feelings aside and just wait for awhile until i feel the same way when i'm around him...i'll be waiting...i guess

      well can anyone tell me when guyz decided to be soooooo stubborn, such jerks, dorks, freaks, hypocrites, and sooo absolutely loveable! omg i swear no matter how much i wanna hate some of them...not matter how much i just wanna slap some of them across the face...i still cant get over how hott and how loving and caring and fun they are.  if you havent noticed i'm not talking about guyz in general i'm talking about one and if you know me well enuf (which most of you do cuz it doesnt take much to figure this one out) you could figure out who it is.  wow well i officially dont like spiders...specially when *guy mentioned above* throws one on you.  so ya i officially coulda killed him  omg two highlights of my day! ready for this! ya its cool (in no order)  1. i definatly was walking along some slightly busy street and these two guyz in a convertable drive by, the driver throws up a peace sign to me and the passenger waved...i could bet money it was joel fine but i'm not completely 100% positive so ya but it was so totally awesome!  2. (take back the whole order thing cuz this one i'm never livin down by my boyz) okay so me, sam and andrew are walking around wesslemans park...we had to go back to sams house and the two dorks ride their bikes there so one of them has to tote me or we're walking the whole way.  okay a) andrew cant ride a bike, specially w/ me sitting on the handle bars b) me...sit on sams bikes handle bars...HA my butt may be small..but not THAT small c) andrew couldnt ride sams bike for reasons that are not gonna be said...just think of the bike seat and how its positioned..ya  so we ruled that andrew could deal w/ his overly informed problems and they switched bikes and sam was gonna tote me to his house so i get up on the handle bars,  and sam starts peddling... he kinda swerves so i was gonna jump off RIIIIIIIIIIIIP supposidly my stupid pants got stuck on a screw and ripped my pants worse than you can even imagine! so ya sam wouldnt stop laughing as i fell to the ground as hes dying laughing he pulls off one of his shirts (calm down, calm down, he had anther one on darn the luck..haha no) and i had to tie his shirt around my waste for the LOOOONG walk home.... i'm currently sitting at my computer wearing a pair of his pants cuz ya when we got to his house he lent me some...ya get ur mind outta the gutter so ya  that was my interesting evening...other stuff like andrew throwing mountain dew all over this window at a gas station...which was absolutely STUPID and the ppl were like staring at us  and ya tori was getting really ticked today and got yelled at by this chick who was wanting tori to move the car but shes not a liscensed driver and her mom was in the mall and ya bunches of crap  so yes...typical day i guess...no   leave some comments and comfort me cuz today was the first time i...ripped my pants  mucho mucho mucho love xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

      i'm seriously considering changing my blog name and my url and stuff so if you have any suggestions just let me know.  i just put this one up for the time being.  if TJ reads this and you wanna help me get the tag board and all that peachy stuff up on this thing that would be just FABULOUS and while ur teaching me that stuff mayb you can give a few GOOD hints on ur stupid crush.  lol wow this has been fun.   dont you just love waking up to an empty house? seeing as i'm practically an only child, during the summer, this happens often. usually my mom wakes me up tho.  mayb she did but i coulda been talking in my sleep like i usually do.  lol tori "I LOVE YOU ***** I LOVE YOU!" haha that was fun!    practically didnt have any chores this morning, thats probably the only reason i'm updating right now is cuz i have time.  all i had to do was empty the dishwasher, question...is it bad when you dont know where certain dishes go IN UR OWN HOUSE?! ya idk   sry if this blog is ever boring.  i guess i'm just not that funny.  wow...thats sad.   sooo ummmm been talking to monkey alot more lately which is alwayz good. still wish i could know what problems they have w/ me so i can fix them too.  i seem to be having a lot of problems w/ friends lately and have often wondered if mayb it was my fault.  i know they all are at LEAST half my fault but i was wondering if mayb they all were ALL my fault.  if you dont understand...dont worry bout it lol  i wasnt lucky enuf to have a 1 in the morning phone call last night...altho "we" (former 1 in the morning phone caller) talked for about 45 min. last night but i had to get back online for some stuff and i think he had to go watch a movie w/ his family.  wow hes really blunt and absolutely hilarious.  now i just gotta think of a good name for him.  monkey knows who i'm talking about so if you can think of a good nick name...let me know...something like "hair" would be good...lol!!!  well i dont like it when mutual friends of mine could possibly have a "thing" it scares me mucho. it would be rather strange and i cant say that i DONT see nothing there cuz i do see a possibility.  so ya interesting stuff.  sry i cant give details.  well ummm guess i will be leaving you all now and TJ get back to me on that help unless you dont want to which would be perfectly fine.  i can alwayz jst invite "linux" over when my parents arent home and he can "help" me w/ some things.  OMG THAT IS SOOOO SICK. i dont even wanna think about that. so if you could help me it would be fabulous!  well everyone this is goodbye for now and i'll probably post tonight to let you know what happened today.  trying to make some plans w/ someone.  so ya and i have to go shower now. hehe cleaning is good.   mucho mucho mucho love xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

      okay guyz...i'm back in town...vaca was fun but i'm done w/ summer and i'm done w/ work and i just wanna start school back up to give me sumthing to do so i wont be lazy anymore...altho being lazy has its good points but anywayz.   tommy....i'm trying to do wat you said....havent really done much i'm jst "psyching myself up for it" lol not but i'm trying  i was talking to someone the other day and he and his g/f have been dating for quiet sometime now and i told him i wasnt looking for love at the age of 15 and he basically yelled at me (online....ya know w/ all caps) "why the heck do you have a b/f then" and i really dont know wat i should be looking for...mayb im not trying hard enuf but mayb i'm putting too much into it i really dont know.   i'm trying to be more comfortable w/ my blog...or as TJ said...trying to trust you all more its just i think my problem is saying something on here and having the wrong person read it and then them saying sumthing about it and me getting myself in a load of crap that i really didnt need to get myself in in the first place...which brings up the posibility of just getting rid of the blog alltogether...i really dont know.   i started a poem over vaca but i was in the car w/ family and i didnt have paper w/in reach w/o someone asking me if they could read it and i didnt want to get it in a mess so i just changed it all around in my head till it sounded good but i forgot most of it.  idk knowing me i probly wouldnt have liked it anywayz cuz i dont like anything i write.  hmmm oh well i guess i'm gonna go take a shower cuz i mowed the lawn today and i might be hangin out w/ sam and andrew today cuz i havent seen either of them in weeks and i miss them both like crazy.  havent seen cody in about 2 weeks either but hes more than likely going to the 4h fair w/ me so thats awesome!  leave a comment cuz i love you and miss you all  i'm sorry...i was thinking about sumthing i did to someone...and i'm the only one that knows wat i'm talking about i was just randomly thinking about it and putting myself in there shoes and i just wanted to say sorry for doing it.

      haha weird title i know...but its mainly cuz my tooth hurts REALLY bad....argh lol  wow todays storm was CRAZY! we got stuck out in our car during it.  our car was like moving back and forth cuz of the wind...we ended up pulling over into a parking lot to be alittle safer i guess...but anywayz there was this poor old lady out in the middle of the street and she was like freakin out. she ran into quite a few things but she pulled over to where my dad could get in and talk to her to get her to calm down.  anwyayz we ended up driving her home and we hope shes okay now.  so prayers out to her!  yesterday was fun...i went over to my grandmas house to celebrate my mommy's birthday which is today and we had cake and stuff and lots of food.  then we went and picked up cody in my grandmas huge car.  when we pulled up his mom and his little sister jumped in next to me and was like...take us w/ you, you have enough room.  lol it was great! but anwyayz cody came w/ us downtown and we met up w/ cj and andrew after much searching.  we got caught in the rain but it wasnt bad...it was pretty funny.  we tried lookin for brandon in the dark but it didnt really work out and we ended up never finding him.    hmmm i cant really think of anything else thats been goin on.  haha this afternoon we got home after the storm and checked the answering machine for messages and my mom had one that had a woman a man and a little kid singing happy birthday to her but didnt say who it was.  we just assumed it was my uncle and his family. but i was talkin to cody later and it was his mom, brian, and his little sister kendall.  it was hilarious when we found out!  sick of waiting  cya later guyz leave a comment! luv ya xoxoxo

      went to see dodgeball tonight and it was purty fun...the movie kinda sucked cuz it was full of too much crap but it had some funny parts i guess.  anywayz i had fun w/ the company tho so its all good  then we were gonna walk over to nicks pizza afterwords and hang out but ended up there almost being a fight and all this other crap between a couple guyz there and it was a mess.  they were all potty mouths too but by the time we got over to nicks it was like 30 min. till i was getting picked up so we didnt get to stay there very long lol it was kinda humorous tho.    Why does it take guyz so long to ask you out? idk wat they are waiting for.  oh well i need to wait anywayz to work somethings out w/ someone else b4 i can have anything happen honestly.  i really wish ppl would see eye to eye w/ me more often but i guess we cant all be that lucky so i honestly pray to God that this someone sees where i'm comin from and if not that i can just move on w/o any guilt.    ya so sam just got back from being outta town for like a week and he was gonna come to the movies cuz hes gonna be leaving tomorrow for another week but NOOOO he has been gone from the house for like 3 weeks and wanted to stay home and "sit around" okay...w/e sam  i worked yesterday w/ michael and tyler for like 3 hours so it was purty fun....they talk alot lol bout random stuff too but i've discovered tonight that most guyz do.  tyler had me try vanilla mello yellow and michael made me try strawberry coke...they were both purty good but i liked the strawberry coke better.  see we have these different syrups that we put in some of our smoothies so when we're not that busy i go up and get a drink and squirt some syrup in it...its purty fun.    dont have too much to say right now...besides i cant stay on much longer but i'll try and write more later! luv ya all a bunch!  xoxo

      school picnic was today...it was alright.  i have to say last years was better...mayb b/c of the new crush and the stalkerish attitude lol altho i do have to say i greatly enjoyed the speech excersizes we did. i specially enjoyed ripping up my cool card and playing ride the pony.  that was probably my favorite.   I had 3 things i could have done tonight...1. go to LOST at church...basically where they drop you off in the middle of no where with a group and you gotta find ur way back to the church but they leave you w/ a little poket money.  2. go to the drive in w/ cody and his d-group and the gurlz d-group that hangs out w/ them or 3. to go over to tjs house....wat does samantha end up doing???? staying home w/ her parents and going to subway wowness..i'm fun  i really dont have much to say ...sry most of the juicy stuff goes in my diary so i'm not lettin any of that out.   blah

       isnt it funny how you can love someone to death one day and then the very next loathe them enuf to want to never see them again!?!?! i really dont think it is.  but i can tell you it sux.        i hear from some i care too much...that i need to go w/ the flow and just let things role off my back...that i let things get to me too easily and i'm one of the few ppl who have such a caring attitude and that its a blessing and a curse at the same time (dont you hate those?) just like being hott....(hehe i love you kid)      but....   dun dun dun      some also say i dont care enuf...i let ppl slide w/ just a sorry which is just a word coming outta their mouths and its just dripping w/ disrespect and unimportance...the one you thot cared is really just manipulating you into their little slave cuz you've had them on a pedestal for as long as u've known them and its coming back and slapping you in the face...WHOA NOW i totally got way off...thats me venting w/o names      i was reading this stupid mythology thing and found myself acting very "blondish" when it took me a chapter to realize why Echo was named Echo and why she was cursed w/ only the ability to repeat wat others say instead of having speech for herself.      but on the smart side of things...going back to my natural brunette color, i found the story about cupid and psyche very interesting how she let her sisters convince her that he was something he wasnt and she almost lost him forever....she went to great lengths to get him back of course but idk its weird how ppl influence you into thinking one thing when its something totally different.        ya know those ppl that came up w/ this stuff had a good idea on how to fix how things happened....i really think its all bogus but its kinda interesting some of the stories they think of....      omg i was totally thinking about how frikin scary would it be to suddenly like turn into a tree...wow       ANYWAYZ      i hate how guyz dont understand the meaning of gurlz time of the month...oh well they will jst never understand and i guess i'll just have to deal w/ that....   thank you for listening to one of sams boring blogs but plez leave a comment and let me know wat u think i should do or who u think i am or if you think i should just shut up...run away to the beach...and figure it out myself or if anyone agrees w/ me when i say i feel like i'm sounding like a certain someone...hmmm much homework for you all! hehe    luv you guyz
