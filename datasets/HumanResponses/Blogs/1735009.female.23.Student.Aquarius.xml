       Conference Highlights   So I got up.  I went.  The van picked me up at 6:20 in front of my apartment, we went to campus and got everyone else, and we were off!  We arrived at the Rolling Hills Country Club in Peters Township (very very  very  beautiful, by the way) a little before registration and breakfast ended - in plenty of time for the conference.  Glenn Miller, the president of the Pennsylvania Library Association was the first to speak.    The title of his piece was:  Library Funding Crisis: Would You Like Sausage With That?   It was interesting.  He's very knowledgeable and funny.  Good talk.  The second speaker was Robert Schnick from LECOM. His talk was titled:  The Convergence of Technology and Health Sciences Librarianship.   He was a little difficult to follow since he kept switching topics very very quickly.  Then there was the 25th anniversary of the Center for the Study of Rural Librarianship.  Good times there.  Lunch.  And after lunch was  Creating a New Order of Librarianship  by Bobby Player, the president of the Black Caucus of ALA.  He was very interesting.  Very smart.  At the conference I met a few librarians.  Had lunch with two librarians who are also childrens book authors.  Met the librarian that works with my mom, as well as a librarian that gave me an email address for another person who could set me up with a job in the Pittsburgh area.  He was super super nice and very awesome to talk to.  We talked about English!  He has his Ph.D. in English.  So very very awesome.  :o)

      Showed Dr. V the marketing webpage today.  I'm going to be pondering his comments for awhile.  I think he made most because he didn't actually  read  the information on the website, just mostly glanced through the layout and such.  But we'll see.  Much talk about the upcoming book/bake sale.  I have some books that I'm going to donate.  I'm also signed up to bake.

      The marketing webpage is up and running.  It's been up since Friday.  I love it!  So far, no one has taken the survey, which is a downer, but I just have to believe that it's early and people  will  take the survey!  They will!  They don't want to make me cry...  Spent my break searching for jobs, as well as doing homework.  Didn't find many, but I got the updated info on the civil service.  Still have some questions about the application and procedures.  Sometime, when I'm actually awake, I'll read the form in depth.  Sometime.  And for fun....        You're  Waiting for Godot !   by Samuel Beckett     Many people think you're extremely dull, but you're just trying to patient. Really patient. Patient to the point of absurdity, quite frankly. Whatever you're waiting for isn't going to just come along, so you can stop waiting. I promise. Move on with your life. Change of scenery might do you good. Heck, any scenery might do you good. In the meantime, you do make for very interesting conversation.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      Dave from EBSCO visited our Collection Development class last night do discuss different aggregators.  With him being from EBSCO and all, you would think that he'd give us a very biased talk about the wonders of EBSCO and talk down about their competitors.  He was actually very open-minded and mostly spoke in general terms about what we would face when we entered the library and a vendor would come up to us and give us their sales pitch.  There was some mention of competitors and the wonders of EBSCO, but for the most part, that was kept to a minimum and only mentioned when he was answering specific questions that people had.  What was most helpful and interesting was at the end, when we started grilling him about jobs and libraries, and all that stuff.  See, he has a MSLS from *gasp* Clarion.  So we started asking him real-life questions about the benefits of this program out in the real world.  What kinds of things he faced when he was working as a librarian rather than for an aggregator.  He was very frank and honest.  We liked that.  All in all, it was a very interesting class.  Scary that I didn't know what some things that he mentioned were.  Very scary.  Found out yesterday that the guy that usually teached Database Searching isn't going to teach it over the summer.  Rather, Basil, one of the librarians from downstairs in the library is going to teach it.  We're all questioning that.  We want Matt!  Yesterday I finally met Sharon, the librarian I've been corresponding with about the marketing webpage.  Went to the library to look at the pictures in order to pick a few out for the webpage.  Hopefully I'll finish that up tonight and forward it to her this weekend - Monday at the latest.

      Got a letter today.  My resume has been received.  I will be notified "shortly" if I have been selected for an interview.  Butterflies.  Whirling in my stomach.  But not as many as there was when I got my first notification from the other job I applied for.

      Picture this. A large, gothic structure. Imposing. Monumental. In a word, huge. Inside, towering stacks filled to overflowing with books. Shadowed aisles. The perfect setting for a gothic movie. Old man, with only candlelight to guide him down the aisles as he searches for what he needs. Wonderful. And in a shadowed corner would be a large desk, covered in books and papers. It would be from this desk that I would do my research and shush any patron that dared enter my domain. But that's not to be. That, my dears, is a stereotype that I hope to help crush some day.   Me? I hope to be knowledgeable enough to help my patrons when they come to me. I hope to be friendly enough that they won't fear coming to my desk. I want my personality to show through, not be stifled. I am not the steel gray-haired librarian with glasses perched on her nose.   I now spend my minimal free time searching for jobs. Sent out my resume/cover letter package to two positions so far. One at Frostburg State University and the other at Daemen College. My search area encompasses the entire northeast. I would prefer to stay in the NY/PA/MD area, but if that is impossible, I'm willing to move. We shall see.   It's mind-boggling that I will complete my MSLS in July. One year. It took 4 years to get my BA in English, and only one to get my masters. Something about that seems wrong. Like I should be spending more time on my masters. Like it's not enough time to learn everything that I need. Crazy.   But tomorrow I am off to the public library in Rimersburg to meet with the librarians there about the marketing plan I'm working on for them. Then collection development tomorrow night to learn all about the acquisitions process. A process that I wrote a 17 page research paper on last semester.

      I got my second rejection!  Go me!  Again, it was to a job I didn't want.  Wonder how upset I'll get when I get a rejection from one I would like to have?

      Waiting.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm waiting for an online appllication to load so I can apply for a job.  I don't know if I really want it, but at the moment I just keep thinking that if I have the required qualifications, I'm going to apply.  Really, what are the odds that I'm going to be offered the job in the first place?    Has the job rejection caused me to become more cynical?  I don't think so.  It wasn't one of my top jobs.  I actually forgot that I applied for it, but any rejection can cause a little bit of pain.  Must move past that, put on a brave face, and keep applying.  So that's what I'm doing.  Every day I search for jobs, well every day except the weekends.  I try to remember to check the email address that is on my resume, but when you have about four different ones, you tend to forget.  But I try.  Also going to email former bosses today, to keep up with them, see what's new in Fredonialand.  I miss that place.  I wish I would have been as forceful in keeping in touch with some of my former professors as I have been with my former bosses.  I'm hoping someday to get back up there and reopen the lines of communication with some of them.  But the application has finally loaded, so I figure it's time to work on that while rocking out to the best of Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Got a little Phantom playing in the background.  Good music to apply to jobs with, I think.  :o)

      Have I been avoiding this blog?  Well...yes, but I've been busy.  The last few weeks were spent finalizing the marketing plan, pulling together revisions on the disaster plan my group reworked, trips to Pittsburgh and Penn State, writing grand proposals, and just a lot of stress.  But now the semester is over, I have my grades, and I have a month off (give or take a few days) until my final four weeks and two classes of grad school begin.  I am still in the process of applying for jobs.  I recently got my first rejection, but that's to be expected.  I keep searching for jobs and plugging them out, that's not going to stop until someone finally picks me.  We'll see.  I'm keeping positive, or trying to at least.  I am a naturally pessimistic person, but we're keeping the hope alive.  Other than that, not much is going on right now.  I'm looking forward to my final two classes - Bib of the Humanities and Database Searching.

      Got my fourth job rejection.  I'm just racking them in.  :o)  Went to the post office today and mailed out two more applications.  Fingers crossed.  Also locked myself out of my apartment.  I'm so smart, huh?  Sat on my stoop for 2 1/2 hours waiting for my landlords to let me in.  Also just finished the Civil Service Application, so we'll see what comes of that.
