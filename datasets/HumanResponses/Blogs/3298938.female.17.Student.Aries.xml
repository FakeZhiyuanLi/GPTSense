      I shave my legs,  I sit down to pee.  And I can justify  any shopping spree.  Don't go to a barber,  but a beauty salon.  I can get a massage  without a hard-on.  I can balance the checkbook,  I can pump my own gas.  Can talk to my friends,  about the size of my ass.  My beauty's a masterpiece,  and yes, it takes long.  At least I can admit,  to others when I'm wrong.  I don't drive in circles,  at any cost.  And I don't have a problem,  admitting I'm lost.  I never forget,  an important date.  You just gotta deal with it,  I'm usually late.  I don't watch movies,  with lots of gore.  Don't need instant replay,  to remember the score.  I won't lose my hair,  I don't get jock itch.  And just cause I'm assertive,  Don't call me a bitch.  Don't say to your friends,  Oh yeah, I can get her.  In your dreams, my dear,  I can do better!  Flowers are okay,  But jewelry's best.  Look at me you idiot...  Not at my chest????  I don't have a problem,  With Expressing my feelings.  I know when you're lying,  You look at the ceiling.  DON'T call me a GIRL ,  a BABE or a CHICK .  I am a WOMAN.  Get it?, you DICK!?!

      Looking into the mirror She sees herself But knowing herself to be a stranger She turns away Her beauty is shining A beacon of perfection Why does she feel so empty? Why does she feel so alone? Why does she feel so weak? Never falling tears stain her mind She cannot allow them to mar her beauty But the sadness of her expression already does To those who know What she feels She is a creature of self-condescension Blaming herself for the troubles She visits upon herself Why does she feel so empty? Why does she feel so alone? Why does she feel so weak? She silently rages at her beauty But knows she could never give it up What else has she to live for? Silks, jewelry, cosmetics.... Her anchors Yet she detests them Though she'd never admit it Why does she feel so empty? Why does she feel so alone? Why does she feel so weak? Why won't you save her? From her empty perfection                           elijah:)

      flawed.  Sometimes you wake and see A morning bright and clear A holiday, you think From dark past yesterday Someone else you were to be Someone else held your fear Yesterday, you needed a drink Yesterday, you weren’t so afraid All the troubles far and gone The lashes prove your ignorance He punished you for your ignorance And lack of imitation of that girl The perfect one The one you despise You see through her charm of lies They cant see as you do But he wants you like her Why cant you be loved like her?

      What is the beginning? Doesn’t one beginning come from another ending…? Who can really say what it is? Who…? Tell me. I need to know. I get lost in my thought sometimes. Sometimes I cant find a way out. I get scared. What if the answer I find is the wrong one? Then what? Can I go back and change it? What if I cant? I wish I didn’t have a choice.                                  by katie buckley

        The tree that used to stand So proud and tall and strong Snapped like a twig in the corporate hands Of those public servants I loved that tree; it was sturdy, strong and reliable My first love With my initials carved on the trunk When it was young. The scars I gave are still there. Lethargically it bent its branches  When pushed by the wind In the cold autumn seasons But it would never break It was so strong…so reliable... And it hurt me so bad when  That metal hit the trunk And beat it like a drunken father   i cried   andthose memories flowed like my tears   its blood   my blood   my heart   would never be the same
