						   I don't really understand who is going to read this, or how they would find it. I guess that's the whole reason I'm doing this... to connect with someone. I feel like I am constantly searching. I just got my heart broken for the first time, and I don't know how to fully explain what that feels like. I'm sure most people know. I am angry and sad and scared and confused but I am also feeling liberated and empowered and like I guess it was the best thing for me, because I wouldn't want to marry someone (which I thought I was prepared to do) who would end up leaving me or resenting me anyway... Who the fuck am I supposed to be with? As Erykah Badu says, I want somebody to walk up behind me and kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck... Been such a long time, I forgot that I was fine... Actually, I feel more confident than I have in a long time. Yeah, I'm sad and confused, etc... but compared to the emotional depths that I've experienced as a teenager and up until very recently, I am feeling quite strong and capable. I just want to find someone who is equally strong and capable. Someone who likes to actually be with people... unlike most people my age. It seems like everyone just wants to go out and get wasted in a bar where the music is way too loud to have a decent conversation... Don't get me wrong, I love music, but you shouldn't have to loose your voice because you want to have a conversation. Everyone just goes out to check each other out and chug beer... okay, I know I'm being judgmental and ridiculous... but I'm venting. It's scary to think that someone might read this and form an opinion based solely on what they read here... when there is so much more to me it's incomprehensible. My Gramma came over today because my house is on her way home, and there was a tornado in the area. So we were going to watch a video of my sister because she was on the news for like, 10 seconds this morning, and I put a tape in that I thought was the video but it was actually a tape of my sister and I when we were little. That was interesting to watch. I haven't heard my Gramma laugh that much in a long time. She's been getting confused lately, and it makes me sad. I wish I could understand what she does-- see what she sees when she looks at the world through experienced eyes.

						   So, I'm not sure how this works, because I've never read a blog or blogged, but I've heard people talking about it... so here I go. I decided to name my page via della stelleta because that's my favorite place I've lived so far... via della stelleta in a little studio in Rome. Che bellisima. Plus it literally means, way of the little star... and I have a minor obsession with the stars.  Right now I'm far from via della stelleta living at home trying to find my own way in the world-- saving so I can pay my own way in the world, and pave my way into a place of my own in the world... and this world is not cheap. And it's not easy to get ahead when you have a big heart and you want to follow your dreams. Everyone tells me to follow a different path but the path I'm on, I'm convinced, will lead me back to a place that's as beautiful as, or more beautiful than via della stelleta...
