      On vacation as of tomorrow.  Get to see planes and airports through the wide-eyed stare of my little boy.  He is so blonde, so perfect.  I can't wait.

      I can never be completely honest in this blog.  So far it is anonymous, but eventually my ego will cave and I will want someone I know to read it.  That means all the tall tales that have neatly put in the vault shall not be revealed as of yet.  It also means that deep down I will want to write something cool as opposed to something real.  I am such an idiot.  I knew it all along.

      He licked her hand as she slept. Just the back of her hand, not the fingers or anything. He wanted to taste the brackish velvet skin. Her position was fetal, but with legs scissored, as if she was jumping off a diving board to perform for a drunken crowd.  She would leave as soon as she woke up, he knew it. Her scattered clothes were almost set up perfectly so she could dress without breaking stride. Even her Kate Spade sat right next to his apartment door, handles erect, waiting to be snatched with nary a cheek kiss. Her voice would fade as the elevator door closed. Call me she would say. Call meeeee.  He thinks there is a sandwich in the fridge. Or a glass of water. Water would be better. She is waking up.

      Words I read in a book I just started to read.  Written within the first three pages of the book. Enough to make me love writing for a snippet, and then it was back to envy, and trite cynicism about my own ability to form sentences.  Even sentences that simple.  That simply resonate.  That echo in my mouth, in my nasal cavity, making me wish I could use them in a conversation.  Big work party tonight.  Will try not to get too lit as monday morning horror stories are not fun.  They are fun when you are talking about someone else, just not about you.  Lost 1.5lbs, even while guzzling a bottle of Pinot Grigio and a chocolate chip cookie.

      I drink about 4-5 litres of water a day.  This makes me pee every 10-15 minutes.  I am becoming the master of the one-handed hold and shake as I take my water bottle in with me.   Should I be writing more than a diary.  Should I start a story and write it every thursday?  Should I wax poetic about secret longings and potential viking-like conquests?   I surely do not want to be writing about pee and weight and water all the time.  Maybe just observations then.  Like when my orange knap sack hit a woman in the head on the subway and I thought she might say something, but then looked at her and knew she would not.  She was not the brave type.  Although I swear I could read her mind as if she had closed captioning on her parking lot sized forehead.   A friend came over last night.  He brought a toy for my son.  It was a nice gesture and after almost 20 years we still find a comfortable level of conversation.  It was nice to see him, even if he did make out with my wife years ago.   I had a popsicle last night and it was good.  A blue one, just like Hud's.

      Halfway through a typical Wednesday.   Had a bean spinach salad today for lunch, and invariably some person will come up behind and tell me how good my salad is ( I bring the ingredients, and chop it all up right there).  They will then cajole and ask when I am making them a salad hee ho har dee fucking har.  They then walk way with their styrofoam container of tasty fatty goodies nestles in their sausage like fingers.   That was too bitter as I am in a pretty awesome mood.  Maybe I will come back and write more.

      Looked at my body naked today and while still bowling pinesque, the hips are down and the cock looks bigger (only because my stomach is smaller).  I did not want to this to be the losing weight blog, but whatever, it is all that is on my mind lately so hence the continued vein.  My son is not sleeping well, and is stealing away from whatever time we have to ourselves.  But c'mon, when he makes fun of things, laughter ensues, so no hidden resentment.  Extra horny these days, don't know why specifically, but I seek out callipigous women to walk behind on subway stairwells.  Just for the brief 30 step escalating sway that ignites a small fire beneath the equator.  34 and feels like my libido is that of a teenager.  I hope it never changes.

      Gained 6 lbs in three days. I am a fat, button popping hog.  I hate the smell of wet peanut butter. And I love peanut butter.  Tomorrow better be better not as bitter and no wet peanut butter.

      I have been home all week caring for my boy.  I love it and all but I am going a little stir crazy as my wife has been attending to her social affairs all week.  He needs some mother time as he tends to ask about her less as the time goes on.  No one wants to go out though.  They all were out last night whooping it up without me.  My social life has changed since becoming a father.  Yeah.  A shocker.  But it sometimes feels like I am missing something.  But I guess they are.   Maybe I will just pop up to the local pub for a couple of pity pints tonight.  The servers there are nice.   Nice with tight pony tails.  And the draft is cold.

      Oh crud, I mind as well write everyday.  My work life is so non-existant, so boring, so ridiculously innane, that this at least will let me vent and perhaps offer a shake of creativity that I otherwise lack.  I will probably write to look cool though, hopefully allowing some random surfers to drop in and think "hey this guy is cool".  Why do I worry about shit like that?   I feel somewhat light today even though I had an ice cream cone last night.  And a bag of cashews that I did not tell Steph about.  I want to go out tonight, but I am with Hud as Steph had made plans before me.  Somewhere I am happy that I am forced to stay home and tickle my two year old. I have pot so after he tuckers out I can perhaps indulge in my two favourite pasttimes, pot and porn, and accompanying pleasures.  So I do have something to look forward too.

      I have no idea if I will actually start to write a blog.  The idea of writing everyday is somewhat soothing.  But I have no patience or discipline.  We shall see.
