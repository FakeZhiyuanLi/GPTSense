      Ok, let's start with the formalities, shall we? I'm Liz, nice to meet you... I'm 15, and now officially a sophomore. School's only been out for a week (less than, really, but who's that picky?!) and I've already been grounded twice, once from the spice rack (So what if I like garlic?!?!) and once from the shower (Yes, I was grounded from the shower... Apparently I've been using too much water, so now I have to use my parents' shower for the rest of the week... YAY!) My dad's going to Slovakia for three weeks, starting tomorrow, and in one week my Grandma's coming from Oregon for about a month (We've yet to clean the guest bedroom, and tomorrow we're spending the day in Ramstein shopping & possibly seeing a movie, then later in the week we're going to the NAFI for a day, so she's either going to be sleeping on a pile of boxes of Christmas stuff, or we're going to throw it all in the attic...). So she'll be here for two weeks and it'll just be us girls, which means, as the first granddaughter, I'll be spoiled beyond belief, which should be very interesting when we go spend three days in Amsterdam. I've already convinced my mom I should dye my hair neon purple, I wonder what else she'll let me do? So, yeah, for the last few days I've gone swimming at the Cascades for hours on end, and on Thursday (which was supposed to be the last day of school, but the principal said we didn't have to go because Reagan died) I spent the whole day there. For two hours I hung out with Shanny, who brought along Justin, so I felt a bit like the third wheel, but oh well, I still had fun. Then she went home and I hung out with Scott, who, at one point, said he wanted to "f*** my a**" (strangely enough, not the first time that's been said to me, and, even stranger, that's the second time in two months, whith two different guys who knew nothing about the other one saying it, if that makes any sense. (If not, get over it!) It's not like I walk around with a sign on my butt saying "Do me," either, so I'm totally confused, but, then again, I always am, so what ever...). Then, later, he called me fat, so I chased him around the pool, slapped him, then stormed off. Watching him beg for forgiveness was kind of fun. Ok, really fun.Later, when he was walking around the pool, he'd put his glasses on, so I dunked him, then told him he was forgiven. So, anyways, earlier, he'd said his girlfriend had broken up with him, and that she'd been cheating, and he put his arm around me for a second (caught me off guard, I'll tell you that!) and I patted him on the back and said I was sorry his girlfriend had done that to him, and, well... after I forgave him for the fat thing, I couldn't get him out of my head, which is so scary cuz its Scott! And ever since, I've just got this constant image of him and me, well... doing stuff! Nobody's been home because it's summer vacation, so I haven't had anyone to talk to, so I've just been stuck, alone, thinking about stuff, and really hoping somebody gets online! Wow... I meant for that to be a short, simple intro post, but I guess I wrote a novel instead... Sorry!

      I'm his   inspiration...   Good Gods... Even scarier... This doesn't totally horrify me... Oh Gods... I'd still rather have Michael... Nuttin better than a hot goth boy. Mumsy won't like him, though. He's bi, and he's gothic. She's homophobic and believes stereotypes. Not good for me. I'm bi, too, and I'd love to be gothic. Can't wait till college. Though, if I'm going to be a piercer like I want to be, I might not go to college. I might be a potter, in which case I'd go to school, learn pottering, and then be a piercer, see how it goes, then have pottery to fall back on. Fnah! I'm his   inspiration...    In a truck stop in France )so funny) I saw a kid... French kid, probably 10 or 11... white boy... little chubby... and yah know what? He was ghetto! It was hysterical... he had the bandanna and a dirty south jersey... I laughed so hard. Really, who expects to see a ghetto French white boy?! Ahhh... Grandma goes home tomorrow, and as I was saying good night to her tonight, I realized how much time I've wasted when she was here. I stayed in my room... It was awful. We stood there hugging for a few minutes, and she started crying, then I started crying, and now I'm crying again! I'm gonna miss her, and I wasted so much time... At least we played backgammon a lot, and We bonded over being disgusted by cigarettes. I'm gonna miss her. And she invited me to go stay at her house two summers from now, but my parents won't let me because Pig lives there. He's the fat ass room mate who's been staying at my grandma's house for 15 years. He's rude to everybody, and he once held a shotgun (loaded) to my uncle's head. Grandma won't make him leave because she's afraid he'd kill her and her pets. My mom's looking into finding out his criminal record, though, and she might be able to get him arrested for something (we're pretty sure he's a fugitive.). He's said before that he killed one of his troops during a war because (please keep in mind I don't normally use this language) he 'didn't want no n****** on his boat.' Anyways, so maybe mum'll have him out of there soon, or he'll drop dead.

      So, I've been in Amsterdam... I got to see hookers... they had the windows with the chairs and the red lights and the red lacy curtains... some of them had a little sticker on the door with their names... and a few of them took Visa. We tried to go to the tattoo museum, but we couldn't find it... shame... we did see the hash museum, though. And we went in Rembrant's house, Madame Tussaud's and a Torture museum. (urg... nasty...) we also saw the sex museum. You'd be amazed by the amount of orange in Holland. We inadvertantly (large word for being out of school...) went during the semi finals in soccer, so Holland was showing team spirit... damn shame they lost. Peeps at the campgrounds fired cap guns when they scored, and that was fun. I got souvenirs for Shanny, Breebles, & Meggers... Shanny's getting something long & dark... it comes with balls and should fit her perfectly... Breebles is getting a very large, extra horny thing with balls, and Meggers is getting something long, smooth, and shiny... It's thicker round one end, and also has balls... Let's just say they should be highly excited with their gifts... Oh, I went to the Bash today. It was fun. They had a g-force thingy. I saw: Buddha, Traci, Spike, Scott, Scott's little brother (for a little while, then he took off and Scott couldn't find him... lol), Nicole, Brittany, Mario, Jaylene, Doug, and a whole buncha other peeps... Buddha was wondering if Elizabeth P. had invited me over to her house, b/c they were gonna use that as a cover to invite peeps to Buddha's house to get drunk. I didn't get invited yet, so we'll see... I'm straight edge, though, so it's not like I'd be getting drunk, you know? And my grandma thinks Scott likes me. Meggers told him I had a fantasy about him (You know when you're trying to got to sleep, really wierd images pop into your brain? Well, I got one of Michael, Ian, Scott, and I.... yeah... I told her about it, and she told him) and he got grossed out, plus he has called me fat, but, he did say he wanted to screw my ass, and he said to my mom, and I quote "She really helped my with Geometry. She was   my inspiration   to pass." Plus, whenever he saw me, he made a beeline through the crowds, as my family so graciously pointed out. Meh.

      Ok, so, its been a while, but I was busy. Ok, maybe I haven't been that busy. But oh well... It's not like anybody reads this!!! I might update more often if people would add comments!!! Ok, so, campaign season is in full swing, and I feel obligated to share this hilarious flash:  urlLink http://www.jokaroo.com/ecards/funny/jibjabthislandisourland.html  Also, since I last updated, its become really, really, really Gods damn hot here. So, I've got a fan in my room that never stops going. This has caused all of my posters to come off the walls. Not fun. But there have been some awesome thunderstorms. One of em woke me up at 6 AM, it was so loud. I'm pretty sure a few bolts hit behind the school across the street. And I've reread the Harry Potter series in about a week (I stayed up till 2 every night to do it, but oh well.) And I've discovered the wonders of Harry Potter femmeslash (Lesbian fan fiction. Lovely.) And I've told Maigan, Bree, and Shannon that I like Scott. It can't be helped, and he is kinda sweet (in a very dorky way). And, OMG, when I saw him at the pool earlier in the summer, damn, he's built, and none of us had any idea!!! Not that I've told anyone... That's sort of my little secret. I'm definitely gonna ask him to homecoming. I'm sure he'll say yes, too, cuz its rather obvious he likes me. I saw him at the commissary (he's a bagger) and he came running over to talk to me. He mentioned how he was sore cuz he'd been working out. He wants to try out for wrestling. I think its funny, cuz he's so ticklish and skinny. His opponent'd just have to poke him, and he'd be down. And then my mom mentioned the singlet (she was at the store with me) that wrestlers have to wear, and that made me laugh (forcibly, cuz she don't know I like Scott) but Bree saw him run once, and she said he either has very huge balls or needs much tighter underwear. And, in a singlet, I'd be able to see which one it is!!! Oh, and more good news: My dad's no longer going to Iraq, but he did go to the states for training and he bought me Get Born by Jet and Trapt by Trapt. And on September 17th, The Sims 2 comes out!!! I've been waiting for that forever. And I've ordered a prom dress cuz it was on sale and it's pretty, plus Scott's a Junior, and Juniors can go to Prom... ;D

      Ok, this is the post that wouldn’t go through, last time I tried (July 14th). Enjoy.  Dammit! There was an error in publishing my last post! Dammit! It didn't show up, and it was all erased! Here's a summary: I like piercings. I want at least 15 more. I want a Scottish tattoo in honor of my clan. It will be on my hip and I'm getting it next spring. I also want some surgery to make my ears pointier, my tongue longer and my knuckles permanently brassier (on the inside). I also want purple or black hair. And mumsy approves of none of this. And so, basically, I have to wait till I move out for most of it. Oh well. And, also, before I publish this post, I'm going to copy it, so if there is an error, all I have to do is hit paste. Stupid computer.
