        Countless nights have I seeked for your embrace, or yearned herewith, to sleep softly against me. Taking comfort thru my words that I'll chase-away all impurities Clinging to me, close enough, for me to here you breathe.  A candle-lit and fragrant petal-ed room, or space filled with silver and shadows in perfect moon A night, on others eyes, i'd be well-spent for I'm with you That night that I so much crave, I'd be drained, yet&nbsp;I forever bloom.  Fading voice, plucked-off strength,&nbsp; I can't keep these eyes closed for then I'm&nbsp;with you my love, for years, I've longed to hold frightened that the day might come&nbsp;again and&nbsp;take you away from me when there's so much to give, so little time, such night would be so brief.&nbsp;  Upon the morning, in my wake, hope still to see you herewith, Gathering the spoils of lastnights' war, feeding the heart, cherishing it. Stealing kisses...Trifling promises...Whispers forward both slained by Eros, Dying for you to say... "Let another night come forth!"

       I haven't done much lately, except revising a script.(though that was 2 days ago.) I'm up for another boring night working..&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;  We just had a&nbsp;meeting this afternoon and my boss asked me to do some researching about a certain tribe in Thailand. The Long neck tribe. Well&nbsp;I find it interesting though..&nbsp;They're planning to go there next week! (so soon, its&nbsp;as if he just&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;one morning and say "I think I'll go to Thailand tomorrow.")&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I dont have a choice but to spend the night here and finish my work, since I dont have to write another script for the week I decided to start my research now.&nbsp;Oh well my deadline is on monday pa naman, but I dont have plans of staying in the office till Sunday so might as well start now. Maybe I can go home early tomorrow.hehe. (That is,&nbsp;if I'm done na with my work..)        &nbsp;

         Last week we started crystal healing.. At first I was hesitant to participate in such, but as the saying goes there's no harm in trying. So I gave in..&nbsp;&nbsp;Nwei,&nbsp;I cant really say that I'm healed spiritualy but ok I admit I've never felt this relaxed before especially this past few weeks..&nbsp; I've been very busy&nbsp;thinking a lot about&nbsp;scripts, deadline, chuvalyn chenes etc.. But since we started doing&nbsp;the healing session, parang&nbsp;mas relaxed and calmed ako ngayon.. & one more thing, &nbsp;I cant stop thinking about crystals. (Sheryl's fault actually) Good thing my moms been collecting crystals pala, instead of buying she gave all her crystals to me including that heart shaped crystal pendant.. (I&nbsp;liked&nbsp;it) They say its for love,&nbsp;I really dont&nbsp;know (parang wala parin nangyayari sa lovelife ko. hehe) but I consider it lucky.. Well, I still cant believe I'm doing all these things, I mean believing in chakras and all.. Right now im still studying the art of scrying (Talking to crystals telepathically.)     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Is it my turn to wish you were lying here.    I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping.    Is it my turn to fictionalize my world.    Or even imagine your emotions to tell myself anything...    Is it my turn to hold you by your hands.    Tell you I love you and you not hear me...    Is it my turn to totally understand.    To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing...    If I have to give away...    The feeling that I feel.    If I have to sacrifice...    Oh, whatever babe, whatever baby.    If I have to take apart...    All that I am...    Is there anything that I would not do,    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done.    But now I'm underwater and I'm drowning...    Is it my turn to be the one to cry.    Isn't it amazing how some things just completely turn around...    So take every little piece of my heart...    So take every little piece of my soul...    So take every little piece of my mind...    'Cause if you're gone... inside...    I'd die without you...    If I have to give away...    The feeling that I feel.    If I have to sacrifice...    Oh, whatever babe, whatever baby.    If I have to take apart...    All that I am...    Is there anything that I would not do,    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...    'Cause inside I'd die without you...

       The camera pans the cocktail glass,    behind a blind of plastic plants;    I found the lady with the fat diamond ring   then you know I can't remember a damn thing.     &nbsp;  I think it's one of those de ja vu things,    or a dream that's tryin' to tell me something.    Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it.    I don't know, I doubt it.     &nbsp;  Subterranean by design,    I wonder what I would find if I met you,    let my eyes caress you,    until I meet the thought of Missess Princess Who?     &nbsp;  Often wonder what makes her work.    I guess I'll leave that question to the experts,    assuming that there are some out there.    they're probably alone, solitaire.     &nbsp;  I can remember when I caught up with a pastime intimate friend.    She said, "Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely,    but you probably don't think nothin' of me."    She was right, though, I can't lie.     &nbsp;  She's just one of those corners in my mind,    and I just put her right back with the rest.    That's the way it goes, I guess.     &nbsp;  Baby you send me...Set adrift on memory bliss of you     &nbsp;  Careless whisper from a careless man,    a neutron dance for a neutron fan;    marionette strings are dangerous things,    I thought of all the trouble they bring.     &nbsp;  An eye for an eye, a spy for a spy,    rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh.    Tell me that she's not dreaming.    She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning.     &nbsp;  Reality used to be a friend of mine,    'cause complete control, I don't take too kind.    Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on.    Guess who's piece of the cake is Jack gone?     &nbsp;  She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign.    I told her whispers in my heart were fine.    what did she think she could do?    I feel for her, I really do.     &nbsp;  The next day I had the ring finger on her hand,    I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan,    but I had to put her right back with the rest.    That's the way it goes, I guess.     &nbsp;  Baby you send me... Set adrift on memory bliss of you

       If I'd be found guilty chasing some silhoutte my love it was yours, on such time and place that I nourish. If I've been seen strung-out on some reverie my love it was all about you, as it was and always will be.  Without you, this life is stripped-off of it's means. Without you, this life is just a bitter parody. Yes, I'm bound to waste-away on such short notice yet days, for me, seems forever, and such days are not graced.  yours is the water that quenches this thirst, you are the forming center of my universe. yours are the hands that took me away from all these emptiness the figure in my canvas, the sole means of my existense.  You are the pillars from where I drew my strength, and now with sadness at hand, I ask of you, to take me away once again.   -- isn't he a sweetie? Ü

          Went to work as usual, left d office at 5pm for our diving class. Today's our last day and we spent only 2 and a half hours underwater. Had our lecture under 15 feet using sign language ofcourse and I guess I did passed the tests..I'm lookin' forward on Saturday. Actually I've never been to Anilao and our boss was kind enough to bring us there for scuba diving.. Yey.. Hope to get a nice tan. hehe..

        We just had another session of our scuba diving class and it was kinda tiring but its really worth it. They thought us how to help our buddy (thats what we call our partners underwater) in distress ofcourse thats for emergency only. Hello, I cant even swim I think I'm the one who needs help here. Nwei, my suspicions were confirmed today that we'll be doing strange things underwater. First we have to remove our regulator inside the pool then retrieve it back, I'm just so reluctant to do this because of two things first, I dont know how to swim, and it scares the hell out me. I kept thinking what if something bad happens and I drown. Then 2nd, Its very cold down there and we spent like 3 hours in the pool. By the way were having an evening class so its much colder.

         This is a guide to basic kissing, i.e. you learn the basics and get the basics right, then experiment and try different styles and more advanced techniques.           The basics       1. Brush your teeth, get a good bath, nicely groomed and clean and fresh, before meeting the other person. There's nothing worse than kissing the rear end of a garbage truck  2. Get into a comfortable position - you can't kiss if your back feels like it's gonna break. Suggestion - Sit side by side on a comfy sofa.  3. Hold your lover, firmly but gently - don't cause pain. Suggestion would be to hold the shoulders, the neck or gently on the side of the face, one side or both sides.  4. Move your faces closer. Don't bump noses. Suggestion would be the guy angle his face slightly so you don't bump noses.  5. Kiss gently, normal closed lips kissing, and close your eyes. Closing your eyes increases the sensations you feel, and also sets the mood.  6. Continue kissing gently. Get comfortable with simple closed lips, lip-to-lip kissing before going anywhere else.  7. If fine till here, tentatively, slowly and lightly draw your tongue across the other person's lips.  8. Chances are from here, if the other person lightly parts her tongue, slowly explore the other person's tongue in a light licking motion.  9. The tongue has a very sensitive surface, which is why tongue to tongue is the essence of french kissing.  10. After you've tried lightly licking the other person's tongue, you can try sucking on it, wrestling with it ( see if you can hold it to the floor of her mouth ) and other things like that.  11. Explore the other areas of the mouth. Especially the roof of the mouth. Lightly lick, or tickle the area with your tongue.  12. Don't bite. whatever you do, don't bite.  13. Don't swing your tongue round and round like a windmill. Explore lightly, don't drill your way through.  14. Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose. I say again, breathe through your nose.  15. Follow so far? You can lightly use your hands too, lightly rubbing the other person. Suggestions, along the waist, along the back, the arms, especially the inside of the arm, the neck, maybe running your fingers through her hair. Again, don't cause pain.  16. Continue kissing.  - got this from the net.. 'Think i have to find mr. right first.. hehe

        I am sooo happy! Just came from our diving class, I never thought I can do it but I did! At first i was so scared to go underwater hell, i dont even know how to swim but ofcourse with the help of our dive instructor and the gadgets ofcourse (scuba diving gear) I was able to go 15 feet under.. Hah! It felt so good..           Atleast now na-overcome ko na yung fear ko underwater.. Though we still have to attend a few more sessions and then I'd be able to explore the sea na.. Wish hindi ako mag-freak out pag nasa open sea na.. Ü
