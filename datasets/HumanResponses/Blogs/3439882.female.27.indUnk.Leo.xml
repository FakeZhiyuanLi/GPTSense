      Today is the day that I lose all connection with NYC. The cable and internet are being disconnected in about an  hour.  The remaining dregs of my existence will be swept  from my apartment, and by the end of the day, three huge  pieces of luggage will be packed and ready to go.  Tommorrow I fly to Cali, with a pissed off cat in tow. I spent last night trying to assimilate him to the Sherpa  cat carrier.  He started to get better at it after about  an hour of trying to play with him in the carrier, feed  him in the carrier, praise him, etc.  It was exhausting. But necessary.  The last three times I put him in, he  tried to scratch his way to freedom.  Needless to say,  he has nearly destroyed the expensive carrier the vet  told me to buy.  Alas, palm trees here I come.    Yours in flight,  Xiola

      Dear Boys & Girls:  Our blog today begins with a Midwestern girl living in NYC. Since our Midwestern girl has lived in the Big Apple for the  past 4 years, she has witnessed both 9/11 and the Blackout,  but also: Guys Who Whip It Out on the Subway, People Who Talk  to and Yell At Themselves, The World's Drunkest People, The  World's Smartest People, The World's Rudest People" and everything  (and I mean EVERYTHING in between).    Needless to say, our heroine is burnt out and in need of some  sunshine and fresh air.  So, she's packed up all of her worldly  possessions, given all of her money to UPS, and is heading out  on a jet plane to Sunny (poluted) California.  Join her as she makes  this crazy journey and places herself (once again) completely  out of her element.    Time Out gives "Midwestern Belle" four stars, Gene Siskel raves: "Expect the movie version to be even better than the book!", and  Carson Daly muses "When are they gonna come out with a soundtrack  for this thing already? As soon as it drops, I'm gonna play it into  the GROUND!"  As Bette Davis once said, "Fasten your seatbelts kids, it's going  to be a bumpy night," but this newbie blogger, for one, is looking  forward to the trip...

      It has been such a long time, sweetie-darlings.   Now settled in Long Beach and working in Newport  Beach (two places with the word "beach" in the  name), I truly feel as if I've been abducted by  aliens.  However, I really didn't go far enough,  because W. is still my President.  Oh well,  better luck next time, dearie.  Do me a favor and go to Friendster right now. Do a search for all females between the ages  of 22 and 30 in and around Long Beach (zip code  90803).  Tune in, Tokyo!  Am I the only non-asian  around here?  No, really, the ratio is humorous. Try it.  Took a trip to Laguna Beach yesterday.  It's sooo  nice.  I will never be able to afford to live there. Add it to the list formerly topped by Manhattan.  But hey, that's why I LOVED Brooklyn and will now  LOVE Long Beach.  If there's one thing I've learned  from Nicole Richie by watching The Simple Life 2,  it's that you can act like you love it, and you WILL.   Xiola
