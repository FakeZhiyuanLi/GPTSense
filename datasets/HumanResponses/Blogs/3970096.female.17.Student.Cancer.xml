Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.   urlLink  What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?    brought to you by  urlLink www.quizilla.com   urlLink
