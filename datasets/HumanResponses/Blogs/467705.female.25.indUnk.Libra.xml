      I'm starting anew.  Ditching the password-protected Diaryland and (gasp!) going public!  Stay tuned.  I'm hilarious sometimes.

      Listening to:  Stevie  by Yesterday’s New Quintet  I had a dream about Mama the other night.  She was bedridden; her body wasn’t whole.  She was sickly looking, wasting away, her head covered with peach fuzz that couldn’t grow back any thicker.  She looked very much the way she did in the last few weeks she was still alive, but in my dream she was just a torso and head, no arms or legs.  In my dream she said to me, “Kiss  ko ,  anak ko ” (“Kiss me, my child”).    Before Mama went unconscious [her body took weeks to shut down, little by little], she said to me, “Kiss  ko , baby  ko ” whenever she was aware that I was by her side.  Whenever I sat by her, she told me she loved me and I told her I loved her—I never left her without saying it because I was always afraid it would be the last time for me to say it to her or to hear it from her.  The day after Mama went into her coma, Daddy called me, crying, telling me to go to Bakersfield.  He said the night before Mama's condition got even worse (to the point where she was just barely holding on), he and my Auntie Thelma were praying with her and she said something, but he couldn't make it out.  He said after she repeated it a couple of times, he realized she was calling for me.  I drove for four hours to be by Mama's side, early the next morning; the second I walked through the door and went to her, she focused her eyes on me for a bit.  Then they rolled back into her head; I slept on the floor next to her that night.  The following evening she passed away.   Sigh.   A couple days ago I also dreamed about my boss.  Her father passed away from cancer also; he died about a week ago.  My friend K’s father also passed away from cancer a couple of months ago.  K didn’t know my mom passed away til last week, when we talked a little bit about our experiences.  Mel mentioned to me that a new Hyphen staffer on the edit team's mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (my mom had breast cancer).  Crazy.    I’ve been toying around with putting together a fundraiser.  I know I want to have a big joint birthday party with Adrienne in September, so maybe that could be it?  Charge like $5 at the door and donate all the proceeds to the American Cancer Society in my mom’s memory.  We’ll see.  Anyhow. Sorry to go on about cancer and death so early in the morning.  Hmmm…  This morning is the exception, but generally I have this routine of watching the news as I get ready.  I watch local news on Channel 3 and NBC’s Today Show.  Yes, I loves me some Matt Lauer.  Um, is it bad that I find Scott Peterson to be attractive?  I mean he's got that tall, dark, handsome, brooding thing going on.  But then again, that whole dark/brooding thing could just be my own personal bias from all the trial coverage I’ve seen.  Really, though, he’s a good-looking man.  Once I glossed over the cover of a tabloid paper while at the grocery store and the picture of him made me do a double take.  From the angle, I thought he looked like my old USSC (Ultimate Super Secret Crush).  They look similar, but my USSC’s face isn’t so angular and his eyes are more Asian looking (my [old] USSC is hapa/ mestizo /half Asian).  And how about the “hot” 23-year old teacher who had sex with one of her students?  So Mary Kay Letorneau.  Sounds like the average adolescent male’s fantasy to me, no?  I thought about it—and go ahead and think I’m screwed up—but if Mr. Rapp (my 8th grade history teacher) or Mr. Davis (my 12th grade AP History teacher) wanted to seduce me when I was younger…  HOLLA!  But it’s not like at 13 or 16 I would’ve really known what was going on.  Like, “Why is your thing all big and sticking straight out?  It looks funny...  You wanna put it in my what?   WHAT!? ”   Ay naku .  For real.  Yikes.  Aiight, I gotta get back to Hatty about this e-flyer design for the Hyphen event.  And search for these last 11 publications on Bacon's for a big media mailing on Tuesday.  My work is never done.    Have a happy holiday weekend.  Drive safe, eat lots of barbecue, don’t use illegal fireworks and blow your hand off, and all that good stuff.  I’m spending time with my dad and my crazy aunties (my dad’s younger sisters) in Milpitas, so you know it’s ON with the Filipino food!  NUMMIES for me!

      One Week, One Week!  Hello from Kinko's.  I only worked from 11 AM to 3 PM at Panache today; afterwards I headed downtown to the Mother Jones office to drop off six boxes of Hyphen magazines to Yuki (the publisher).  The past three issues, I was the one to pick them up and drop them off to Yuki.  Yuki has the funniest reaction when she sees the magazine for the first time, after it comes back from the printer.  As she turns the pages, her eyes get bigger and bigger and she'll be like, "Yes!"  The "yes!" gets louder and louder--I liken it to an orgasm.  With that said: one week til the Hyphen one-year anniversary party!  One week!  One week!  I'm so excited!  Oliver and Mike are spinning!  They're my favorites!  In my old Diaryland I used to refer to Oliver (O-Dub) as "myyyyy heeerrroooo!"  At Directions In Sound, back in March, he did the best set.  He played Alicia Keys over this rocksteady-reggae sample.  I almost died, it was so good!  And Mike?  Mike's like  kuya  (big brother).  He DJs every event I've ever put together, just about.  I owe him lots of big fat kisses and hugs and dinner and drinks (and more money).  I guess that's why he's called Mike Nice, huh?  Me being me, I'm also worried about numbers (attendance).  I'm always worried about turnout, even if I have a good feeling.  (Like for Hyphen's launch party last year, I knew around 600 heads would turn out, and did.  But I still stressed on it.)  But I think I'm doing better with the worrying--I know everything's locked down.  As far as logistics go, all details are taken care of (or will be).  I meet Adrienne in about forty minutes; we'll do all the decoration shopping at Party City (or whatever it's called) in Daly City.  Adrienne and I are the Dynamic Pinay Duo at Hyphen!  But no more Hyphen talk.  All I ever talk about is work.  Let's talk about  BOYS .  I have a new crush.  I shall think up a good secret name for him, so I can refer to him in my blog, without his knowing.  (You know, just in case he ever reads my blog.)  When I was on Diaryland I referred to my old crush as USSC (Ultimate Super Secret Crush).  I had a crush on him for like 5 years (seriously).  I still sort of have a crush on him, but I am open to new crushes (that I might actually do something about).  My new crush is a cutie.  *Swoon!*  I think I might have the guts to flirt with him and be more forward, but sometimes I get too in my head thinking he wouldn't be interested in me.  We're different in a lot of ways, though our circles overlap.  He's older, too.  I'm probably too wannabe ghettofabulous and young for him.  But we could have cute babies, I tell you!  (Oh, who am I kidding?  I'm having lots of fun just swooning, so imagine how I'd react if sex factored into the equation.  Mwahaha!)  Anyhow.  I should go eat before I meet Adrienne.  I've been dying to try Quizno's.  Am I the last person in the world to eat at Quizno's?  I need to eat before I drive out to Daly City and get lost in the rice cooker fog.

      A day of wasting time at work...  Two blogs in one day?      For the past hour or two I've been doing Hyphen stuff and just messing around on this website: illustmaker.abi-station.com/index_en.shtml   Try it out.  Everyone in Hyphen made little icons of themselves.  I didn't get a chance til now.  I dunno if the icon really looks like me, but I tried.  I will figure out how to get my icon on here.  F*** a real picture, it's all about an Audrey gif!  Ha!  Okay.  More media mapping and data entry to do.  I'm here til 6 PM unfortunately.  Boo.

      "Bow-wow"  Listening to: Zero 7 on iTunes Eating: Spinach and cheese crepe.  (Will be washed down with Tums and a bottle of water.)  A lunchtime post, as I am on a break at one of my jobs.  (That's right--ONE of my jobs.  I'm all "Hey Mon" Jamaican [no offense to Jamaicans] like that skit from In Living Color.)  Some-freaking-body keeps calling my cell from an "unavailable" number.  I have this policy of not answering such calls unless I'm expecting someone with a blocked # to call me (like Nam).  This person has been calling me the past week, not ONCE leaving a message.  It's getting on my last nerve.  I check my voicemail, dammit!  Leave a message, motherfucker!  Okay.  Rant over.  Everyone involved with Hyphen complains (from time to time) about not being paid for what they do.  I'm totally guilty of this also.  But I realized today, as I spent TWO HOURS emailing press releases (to people who gave in-kind donations, community co-presenters, performers, event posting sites), that I use the Internet at my legit jobs for Hyphen...  It's like I'm getting paid by another company to do Hyphen work.  I need a tshirt that says something like, "Hyphen Magazine: Keeping it gangsta!"  But only I can wear it.  Because I said so.  So, this morning I drove in to work.  I turned the music up super-loud so I wouldn't have to hear how the tires make a grinding noise when I slow down/stop, because the brake pads are thin.  Yeah, that's pathetic (and probably even "ghetto"), but so what?  My car is six-years old and it's got almost 200,000 miles on it from all the driving back and forth between Bakersfield/LA and the Bay Area the past four years Mama was doing chemotherapy.  I hope to replace the old green Turtle Mobile SUV with a smaller hybrid Ford Escape (when those finally come out).  (I grew up in the suburbs; I'm all about driving a bigger car since I learned how to drive in a soccer mom minivan.)  Walking to the office, I passed by a wall with a ripped up movie poster on it advertising that Johnson Family Vacation (or whatever) film on it.  I had to laugh because it had Lil Bow-wow on it.  I didn't laugh because of Lil Bow-wow trying to be an actor, but some weird word association thing that comes to mind whenever I hear "bow-wow" now.  Two weekends ago I was in Milpitas at my Auntie Baby's house (every Filipino has an Auntie Baby).  My Auntie Aurea (like Oreo with an "a" at the end) was trying to be all cool and tell dirty jokes to us youngsters (my younger cousins and I).  She was telling a joke about 69, but calling it "bow-wow."  She sat down on the floor, stuffed animal in her clutches, demonstrating this "bow-wow" phenomenon.  She bowed her neck so her face was buried in the poor teddy bear's butt/crotch (that's the "bow" part), then she was like, "Wow!"  I guess you had to be there to see it and think it was funny.  My cousins and I were laughing hysterically.  My stomach hurt from all the laughing.  Auren (my cousin), Auntie Aurea's daughter, was like, "MOTHER!"  Yeah.  "Bow-wow."  All my Ednalino aunties are seriously  bastos  (nasty).  My mom had a bawdy sense of humor too, so I guess I get it from both sides of the family.  Mama's old co-workers used to call her Hot Mama because of it.  There were instances when I was younger, when I would pretend to not understand Tagalog, so I could listen in on the things all the adults would say.  And I had a hard time keeping a straight face during all those " ay, ka tigas-tigas /Oh, it's so hard!" and  buhok /hair in the  pancit  (noodle dish) jokes.  Ai-ya.

      Listening to: Bittersweeet - DJ Neil Armstrong  Wah!  I'm super-hungry.  (No.  Make that "hongry!")  I haven't eaten anything at all today; I only drank a cup of coffee.  It's been  that  kind of a day.  Yes.  Busy me.  What did I do today?  So much.  I was at the Panache office today, working my little PR gig.  Working at Panache Communications is pretty fun; definitely a ton of work.  It's high tech PR, so it's totally different than what I'm used to doing with Hyphen or Directions In Sound (music and film) publicity.  Last week I started work on a last minute project, researching media for the Internet media arm of a big (can't name drop--I signed a contract that doesn't allow it) advertising company that just completed the Spanish and Chinese language sites for a major airline (again, can't name drop).  The other week I did analyst research on the wireless/GPS industry, for MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators--think Boost Mobile or Virgin Mobile).  My next project is to write copy for a DM (direct mail) for the Panache PR Pearls e-newsletter.  I am trying to get into high tech/investor relations PR, to compare it with entertainment PR.  Two extremes, I know, but I can't quite figure out what it is I want to do with the skills and experience I have.  Enough PR shop talk.  I know it must be boring to read about.  So...  Earlier this afternoon (after I got off work from Panache), I picked up issue 4 of Hyphen magazine from the printer in South City (that's South San Francisco, for all y'all non-locals).  All 22 boxes fit into my car (back seats pushed down, of course).  My car was so laden down with excess weight, I had to drive like an old lady to my place and drop of 6 boxes before driving to Oakland to drop another 6 boxes off at Melissa's.   Poor green Turtle Power Mobile.  I love you.  You've been so good to me.   Don't worry.  You're getting new tires and break pads this weekend.  :)  Anyhow.  Hyphen issue 4 looks DAMN good, let me tell you.  Vivid colors, nice paper stock, great content.  Oh, and didja know there's gonna be a par-tay on the 9th?  Yeah, stay tuned.  I'll be plug-plugging away...once I get the freaking final draft of the press release done.  (Tonight, I promise!)  I've just been in a strange mood all day.  Mad impatient.  I actually bitched out this car/driver in front of me in traffic today.  I was pissed that I was riding his ass when all of a sudden he decides to parallel park.  I had to wait til all the cars in the lane on my right passed by til I could switch.  Grrr!    I'm sure part of my having a short fuse today has to do with not eating all day, but also just that I woke up early, all annoyed at my landlord's dog.  The damned dog just doesn't know when to shut up.  He (his name is Gino) starts barking, and then the dog next door starts barking...  Sheesh.  When I was unloading boxes of magazines into my storage space this afternoon, Gino started barking at me.  I was about to get my neck-roll on, for real.  Just start swearing at Gino in Taglish: "Shut the f*** up, Gino!   Lutuin kita, ha /I'll cook you!"  Sometimes I want to grab that dog by the ears and tell him he'll be  adobong na aso  (dog adobo).  Mmmm.  Adobo.  I am so hungry.   Sigh.

       Listening to: So Much Soul (Volume 2) by Vinroc   So I've been pretty busy the past month or so.  Just one thing after another.  Not a bad busy, though.  Today was my day off.  I had a day off last week--the 40th day of mourning since Mama passed away.  I don't know if the 40th day thing is a Filipino or Catholic thing, but I took the day off to reflect on my own, since I'm not Catholic.  I realized last Wednesday that although I still miss Mama terribly, lately (because I've had so much work to do, and have been busying myself by hanging out with my friends) it doesn't  hurt  to miss Mama.  I am still wearing her wedding and engagement rings to remind me of her.  I don't know when I'll be taking them off, but for now I like having the reminder--like she's always with me.  I went to see Fahrenheit 911 today at the Metreon, by myself.  My eyes teared up a few times.    The first instance was in the beginning, before the shots of 9/11 came on, before Michael Moore showed reactions of people watching the planes fly into the WTC.  It brought me back to the trauma of that day, how surreal and scary it was for me, even though I was far removed from it all.  I was grateful Moore didn't show any footage of the planes actually flying into the buildings.  I remember that day--I was at school, watching a TV in the library, and I started crying as I watched people jumping out of windows in the WTC.  The second time I started tearing up during the film was when Moore showed Iraqis condemning American troops and President Bush for killing civilians.  There was an older woman lamenting the senseless death of her brother and the bombing of his home.  It was like she had the same exact words to convey how I feel about the loss of my mom, even though my loss is a result of something different.  Cancer, war--both senseless losses to me.  Mama was a beautiful person who fought for a long time.  I'm still trying to make sense of why she was taken from me.  Yeah, walking out of Fahrenheit 911, I felt really disturbed about American politics/government.  I'm pretty apathetic about politics, but I do my best to stay informed so my opinions aren't half-assed.  During the film was the first time in a long time that I felt really compelled to  do something .  Anyhow.  I just spoke to Daddy today; he's coming up to the Bay Area for the 4th of July holiday weekend.  It will be the first time for him to visit me here since I was a freshman living in the dorm.  Even then, we didn't get to spend time together.  I just remember getting a random call from him that he was in town for a few days.  He came by my dorm and dropped off a TV and VCR for me, gave me some pocket change--and he was gone.    I'm excited--this time I hope to take him out to eat, walk around, whatever.  I didn't get to spend time with him when I was in San Diego at the beginning of the month.  Daddy's not very adventurous about food, and lots of things are  bawal  for him (not good for him to eat; can trigger his gout).  But maybe Daddy will like real Thai food (there's no real Thai food in Bakersfield), or even Burma Superstar?    We'll see.

      My 4th of July weekend got off to a crazy start.  I was supposed to go to work Friday, and make a stop in Millbrae to pick up a newspaper for Eelynn (one of the account supervisors at Panache).  But when I exited onto Highway 1, right by my house, I felt my car jerk and saw the “brake” light turn red, so I pulled over on the side of the freeway to assess the situation.  When I tried to stop, I had to coast for a bit, and then my brakes were grinding til I completely stopped.  I was on the side of the highway, cars zooming past.  My dad was going to go with me to a mechanic the next day to get new tires and brake pads.  (Does that constitute irony?)  I called AAA to come tow my ass home or to the closest auto shop.  While waiting, some CHP (California Highway Patrol, for those who didn't grow up watching CHiPs) pig rolled up behind me, beeping at me.  Like I was dangerous or some shit, he's all, "Ma'am, get back in your car, please."  (I was walking around my car to see if I could tell anything was wrong, fixable.)  I was on the passenger side and sat down in the passenger seat.  Then the cop came up and made this motion, meaning he wanted me to roll down my window and talk to me.  The way I was sitting was awkward, because there were things at the foot of the passenger side, so I had to twist in a funny way to face the officer.  I could tell he was all looking down my blouse.  I was thinking, "This cop's trying to scope out my titties!"  So I sort of arched my back so my cleavage would be more prominent, thinking, "Maybe if I give him an innocent look-see, he'll be more efficient and helpful."  Didn't happen.  I ended up telling the cop that I had already called AAA and someone was coming to tow my shit away within the hour.  The tow truck took me to the closest Firestone, then Firestone told me it would cost over $600 to fix my brakes because my right brake pad fell out and the right rotor (whatever that is) was grinding on metal, so there’s a chance they wouldn’t have to replace just the rotor on the right side, but the caliper (whatever that is), too.  I called Eugene (my landlord), to see if he could come pick me up, and as we talked more about my car problems, he told me to have my car towed back to the house and his friend would work on it this weekend and only charge me for parts.  (Filipinos always trying to be thrifty and use hook-ups.)  So I had AAA tow my car back (I’m a Southern Cali member, so I get more tow mileage allowance), and Eugene had his mechanic friend order new brake pads and rotors for my car (he said it will only cost me $400 even) but…  It’s Tuesday and my car still has yet to be fixed.  But I fly down to San Diego for a few days tomorrow anyhow.  Doesn’t matter.  I’ll be back in time (Thursday) to prep for the Hyphen One-Year event at Lamia, and I’ll just rent a car for a day or two.  I told Eugene my car HAS to be fixed on Saturday.  Anyhow, Daddy and his two  kumpares  (friends) drove up from Auntie Baby’s house in Milpitas to pick me up on Saturday morning (they slept at Auntie Baby’s for the holiday weekend).  They drove me to Milpitas and I got to eat  halo-halo  (hadn’t had that in years—it was so yummy!), crab, lots of pork (can’t be Filipino and not eat pork!),  dinuguan  (“chocolate meat”) and  daing  (fish marinated in vinegar and then deep fried or grilled).  I got annoyed with my aunties because they were telling my dad to tell me to stop wearing my mom’s engagement and wedding rings.  They’re concerned about some guy seeing me wearing the rings (on the wrong hand!) and thinking I’m married.  But I really don’t care about any cock-block action.  No guy (that I would bother looking at twice) has tried to holla at me in the past 6 months anyhow, so I’m not tripping.  My mind’s not even there, really (on guys).  It’s definitely not priority.  My aunties are probably worried that I’m a lesbian or will become a spinster who forsakes love for career, or something.  (They nag me like, “You’re going to be 26 and you don’t have a boyfriend?  When are you planning on getting married?”  Mama and Daddy brought me up to not to worry about living my life according to some schedule.)  When I’m around my aunties I just won’t wear the rings.  Aside from these two pictures I’ve tucked away in my wallet, they are the only “travel sized” reminders of Mama that I can take along with me on a daily basis.  In any case, I have a pretty busy week since I’ll be in San Diego for a few days and then the Hyphen event is Friday night.  I’m going down to San Diego because my dad finally got work orders to go to Japan (my dad works for the Department of Defense—Military Sealift Command [he’s also retired Navy]), and he leaves for port on Saturday.  I want to spend as much time with him as I can; I won’t see him again for another 4-6 months (til around Christmas).  I probably won’t be able to communicate with him much except random 3 AM phone calls once or twice a month, and brief emails written in all caps every other week.  When Daddy’s at work, I’ll have nobody to claim to—I’ll be alone in the world…  It really makes me miss Mama to think about it that way.   Sigh .  Okay, write again soon.  Hyphen meeting tonight to discuss last minute logistics for our anniversary event and label/package mags to send out to subscribers, then I gotta get home and pack!  Byeeee!

      Where is the Love?  &nbsp;  I was watching the news this morning and so I have some things to comment on:  &nbsp;  Martha Stewart is going to jail for five months.&nbsp; She got an easy sentence for insider trading.&nbsp; Don’t get me started on the race/celebrity thing.&nbsp; I could go off on a rambling diatribe, citing OJ Simpson and R Kelly along the way.  &nbsp;  The Philippines is pulling out of Iraq.&nbsp; All 50-some troops.&nbsp; (Yes, I’m taking a sarcastic tone.)&nbsp; The Filipino hostage, from what I’ve been hearing on the local news, has family in Pacifica (where I live).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  I’m all in my little bubble, concerned about paying off student loans, moving into a new apartment and furnishing it, buying a new Mac laptop and iPod, turning 26, switching gym memberships, finding a good place to get my hair cut at and bikini waxed…&nbsp; I’m wondering when my new health insurance will kick in so I can go get my wisdom teeth pulled out…&nbsp; My little life is so shallow in comparison to all the other things going on in this world, but it stresses me out nonetheless.  &nbsp;  Sigh.  &nbsp;  Yesterday Eugene (my landlord) was like, “Are you really moving out?&nbsp; You haven’t started packing yet…”&nbsp; I was like, “I don’t move til the 28th or 29th and I don’t have very much to pack (my room is so small, half my shit has remained packed and stashed away in this storage crawl space beneath my closet).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Eugene’s upset that he’s losing a tenant who never seems to be home, keeps to herself, doesn’t make a lot of noise and pays her rent/utilities on time.&nbsp; (Yeah, and being Filipino is sometimes a good enough “pass” with  kababayan  [other Filipinos] for them to trust/favor you.)  &nbsp;  When I moved to Pacifica in April, I put an ad for myself in the “seeking a room” listings on Craigslist.&nbsp; Adrienne recommended it.&nbsp; She said it would be a lot more efficient because all I had to do was write about how fabulous I am and people would respond, thus I’d have the pick of the crop (as far as living situation options).&nbsp; The only places I really liked, that were in my price range, were in Pacifica.&nbsp; I actually wanted to move into a 2-bedroom with another girl my own age (she had a little aquarium with a turtle in it in the living room) just up the street (across from Kenkoy’s—where I get Filipino food on the regular), but she took too long to decide and I ended up moving into Eugene’s house.  &nbsp;  It hasn’t been bad, except once in a while Gino (Eugene’s dog) gets on my nerves.&nbsp; And I’ve had to totally change my eating habits because I don’t have kitchen access (but Eugene provided me a mini fridge and a microwave).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Eugene and my little Pacifica room served me well for the time I was here.&nbsp; I was gone most of April and May anyhow—I was in Bakersfield for like 5 weeks when Mama got sicker and passed away.&nbsp; Although I will miss the free cable, I won’t miss the stupid dryer that still didn’t dry my clothes after a one-hour permanent press cycle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyhow.&nbsp; I woke up this morning, to a Black Eyed Peas video on VH1.&nbsp; (I’d fallen asleep watching TV—VH1’s “I love the 90’s” series.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It made me want to rip my ears off--"Hey Mama!"&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; Am I the only Filipino who doesn’t think they’re that great just because one of the members if half-Pinoy?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hmmm.&nbsp; Last night I finished reading  Sex, Drugs &amp; Cocoa Puffs , so I’m open to suggestions for additional reading material.&nbsp; I got started on  The Fall of Advertising &amp; The Rise of PR , but I’m off to a slow start because it’s not as captivating as I thought it would be.&nbsp; Last month I read this self-help book about daughters whose mothers have passed away, and this book by Danzy Senna (she wrote  Caucasia ) called  Symptomatic .&nbsp; Even though I watch a lot of TV and movies, I make sure to&nbsp;read a lot.&nbsp; Must be balanced that way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Speaking of film…&nbsp; I was pondering over  Before Sunset , which I saw yesterday after work.&nbsp; It’s that film with Ethan Hawke, where he meets up (ten years later) with a woman he met on a train (and spent a night with) in Europe.&nbsp; A lot of the dialogue made me think of my old Ultimate Super Secret Crush (the crush I obsessed over for about 5 years).&nbsp; I started thinking what it might be like if he and I randomly met and hung out in like 5 or 10 years (after no contact for those 5-10 years)—what would we talk about?&nbsp; Would being in his presence conjure up all my old crush feelings?  &nbsp;  Crushes suck.&nbsp; When there’s a crush situation, usually one person has the upper hand—namely the object of the crush, who most likely doesn’t have reciprocal feelings.&nbsp; I’m always the one with the crush; I’ve always felt like this is a handicap, even though I’m not one to wear my heart on my sleeve.  &nbsp;  I hope I don’t ever speak to, hear from or run into my old USSC.&nbsp; I can’t even stand to hear/say his name nowadays—it makes me sad and a bit hurt (angry/bitter).&nbsp; I’d much rather hate him now than remember how full of stupidity and hope I was, when I thought I was in (unrequited) love with him or that there was a slight chance he (at one time) might have been interested in me.&nbsp; He’ll always be the one that got away, the unresolved unrequited crush, I suppose.  &nbsp;  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.&nbsp; I hope you miss me.

      Sex, Drugs &amp; Shopping Therapy  &nbsp;  Listening to: Tommy Guerrero, yeah!  &nbsp; There's a cute Filipino boy who works at Kinko's, but I have a feeling I'm&nbsp;too old for him.&nbsp; Watch him be like 19 or&nbsp;20 or&nbsp;something.&nbsp; I see him whenever I go&nbsp;to Kinko's in Colma.&nbsp;  Holla! &nbsp; (Yeah, right.) &nbsp; Anyhoo.&nbsp; I had this revelation about "star-fuckers."&nbsp; Having worked film festivals the past 5 years, I encounter a lot of people who hope to meet actors and directors--star-fuckers.&nbsp; But me?&nbsp; I've never been starstruck.&nbsp; Not when I met Qbert, not when I met Wayne Wang, not when I met Sandra Oh...&nbsp; However, I recently had a little dose of it.&nbsp; I helped out with the Frameline Film Festival last month (the SF Int'l Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Fest) and the Opening Night film was Touch of Pink.&nbsp; I was working the press line and had to be one girl in a human blockade to prevent starfuckers from trying to ask autographs from Jimmy Mistri and Kyle McLachlan.&nbsp; When Kyle McLachlan stepped out of the limo I was like, "Wow, he's really tall.&nbsp; He's really handsome."&nbsp; I thought he looked so regal.&nbsp; I was starstruck for about 15 minutes.&nbsp; And then this weekend Mel and I took my cousins to Amoeba in Berkeley and once I walked in I saw Lyrics Born at the cashier, paying for some CDs.&nbsp; I walked up to him and said, "Hi, Tom."&nbsp; Not that I expected him to remember that I used to intern at Quannum in 1998, or this exchange we had about me jocking his "Palm P." But... &nbsp; I forget what my point is.&nbsp; Let's move on. &nbsp; I&nbsp;have been watching lots of movies this&nbsp;week (it's only Thursday), going after work (because I get off early enough to catch matinees).&nbsp; So far this week I've seen Anchorman, Saved! and today I saw Before Sunset.&nbsp; I&nbsp;realized that my whole movie kick is because I'm feeling down. &nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I've been super-tired since&nbsp;this week started.&nbsp; Like all the hectic Hyphen stuff is over, my dad arrived in Japan on Sunday night--there's nothing more for me to really focus&nbsp;all my energy on anymore, for me to avoid feeling sad again about my mom.&nbsp; I know I'm depressed when I eat shitty foods and all I want to do is sleep (or my sleeping habits&nbsp;change--I've been falling asleep at 10:30 PM the past few nights,&nbsp;and waking up at 2 or 3 AM, then going back to sleep til abouta 7 AM) or shop. &nbsp; Anyhow.&nbsp; It'll surpass, I know.&nbsp; Just takes time... &nbsp; I feel&nbsp;a strange tickle in my throat, indicating the onset of a cold.&nbsp; You know that feeling, when it hurts to swallow?&nbsp; Sometimes I think that’s worse than actually having a cold.  &nbsp;  Anyhow.&nbsp; Some retard tried to talk to me at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Colma yesterday.&nbsp; I was walking around the magazine section, trying to find Fast Company, and lo and behold an IT-looking white guy (you know what I’m talking about) locks me on his Pinay Radar.&nbsp;  Why does it always have to be skanky, greasy-haired, IT-looking white guys who like Filipinas?&nbsp;  WHY?    &nbsp;  Acting cool and oblivious, I took my stack of magazines and sat down in Starbucks with an iced soy mocha.&nbsp; The guy sat down at an empty table across from me and struck up a conversation.&nbsp; The guy mentioned something about how he’s totally into CHRIS ISAAK.&nbsp; How he used to be an avid watcher of The Chris Isaak Show on HBO, how Chris Isaak is considered geeky because he’s misunderstood and people only remember that video he did with Helena Christensen.&nbsp; I wasn’t sure if I was being tested—was this guy being for real?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I didn’t want to find out.&nbsp; I was like, “Peace out, dude.”&nbsp; I was outta there with the quickness.  &nbsp;  HOW is it that the guys who try to talk to me are always dorky, desperate, socially inept white IT-looking guys?&nbsp; Oh, and let’s not forget homeless—homeless men love harassing me.&nbsp; One time on Haight Street, I walked by this homeless guy who was like, “Come on baby, I’ll show you a good time.”&nbsp; He made these air-humping gestures, flicking his tongue out in that lascivious (“I wanna eat you out”) sort of way, chanting, “Pussy!&nbsp; Pussy!”&nbsp; Ugh.  &nbsp;  So back to my pining: Why can’t the guys I find attractive be attracted to me?&nbsp; Why can’t I get chatted up by guys who have all their teeth, who don’t look like greasy IT guys with Filipina fetishes, or guys who look like a crackhead/pimp character from a Dave Chapelle skit?&nbsp; Why are the guys I like not interested in me, only want to be my friend, already attached, or gay?&nbsp; I’ve been asking myself these questions for 25 years now.  &nbsp;  About nine months ago I was talking to this guy from Virginia who I met really randomly (translation: online/Friendster).&nbsp; He was totally different than me—he listened to mainstream alternative (think Hoobastank and Incubus) and worked for some tech company based in SF that always had him out in the field (Dallas for two weeks, London for one week, etc., etc.).&nbsp; He was a Good Southern Boy who was in a frat in college—a frat where he had lots of Filipino pledge brothers, and so he developed a thing for “hot, petite Pinay girls.”&nbsp; He would tell me, in mangled Tagalog, “ Maganda ka /You’re pretty.”  Can you say GROSS!?  &nbsp;  Ben (that was his name) tried to sway me to be more understanding; accused me of being REVERSE RACIST.&nbsp; I was like, “First of all, you can’t talk race or racism with me—that’s what my whole college experience was about.&nbsp; And second of all, I’m not racist, I’m CAUTIOUS.”&nbsp; I mean, if you were me and some white guy found out what ethnicity you were, then reacted like, “Oh my God, you’re Filipina?&nbsp; Filipinas are totally HOT!” wouldn’t you be freaked out, too?&nbsp; I mean, could you be more obvious about being excited to dabble in Otherness?&nbsp; I want someone to like me because they like ME and not my Filipino-ness.&nbsp; (I should mention that it didn’t help when Ben admitted to me, after I asked him if he’d ever dated any Asian/Filipina girls, that he hadn’t because they’d all prefer to be his friend.&nbsp; Gee, I wonder why.)  &nbsp;  Where oh where is a cute, smart, ambitious, hip, self-deprecating Asian or hapa guy for moi?&nbsp; Someone who finds my neuroses amusing?&nbsp; Someone who can hold his own when introduced to my crazy family (that sounds so  My Big Fat Greek Wedding , I know)?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; I want cute little Asian babies, like the one Angelina Jolie adopted.&nbsp; Can I specifically ask for Asian sperm if I opt for artificial insemination because nobody likes me?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sometimes I fear that I’m doomed to be single the rest of my life.&nbsp; (That’s not necessarily a bad thing, I know—all my aunties think if I end up single it’s because I’m some career-minded Type A bitch.)&nbsp; For Valentine’s Day next year, while all my friends are out on dates, I’m going to have to go to that one gay male strip club my friend told me about where you can grab on The D for $30 admission.&nbsp; I think it’s called Knob Hill or it’s in Nob Hill, or something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Okay, I’m totally babbling right now.&nbsp; I've been writing so much lately; I need to stop. &nbsp; Sigh.

      Pimp My Ride, Just Like Jessica Simpson  This weekend I got sized for a new bra at Victoria’s Secret.  I was rocking out in the fitting room with all the bras the sales girls handed to me to try on, living out my wannabe video girl fantasies.  They were playing Justin Timberlake (“Like I Love You” with The Clipse) and Beyonce (“Naughty Girl”), so you can imagine all the solo dance routines and lip-synching that ensued in front of my dressing room mirror.  But more on that later…  I went to see Anchorman yesterday afternoon.  I dunno how I feel about Will Ferrell.  I’m not sure if I think he’s funny or stupid, but I was in the mood to laugh.  The film was worth the $6.75 for a matinee.  I held back from seeing Spiderman 2 because Yvette and I made plans to see it this Saturday.    Blah.  Countdown, peoples!  Two and a half weeks before I move out of my little Pacifica room, to a Lake Merritt (Lake Merritt is near downtown Oakland) walk-up with hardwood floors and lots of closet space.  I’m moving in with Melissa (the editor of Hyphen and fellow Turtle Lover).  I’m so excited!  I’ll be an East Bay Area-n again!  Mel and I are both turtle girls, and anal retentive about cleanliness and organization, so I think we’re a good match.  I have a feeling we’ll be talking (bitching) a lot about Hyphen, not to mention harboring tons of Hyphen crap in our big hallway closet, but…  I finally get to live in a really nice place, with someone I am friends with (as opposed to strangers I found/who found me on Craigslist).  J  Most importantly, I get to cook again!  I’ve gone the past three months living off of take out, so I’m dying to cook adobo, garlic fried rice and spamsilog (spam and eggs over rice)!  Yay!  Anyhow.  I’m enjoying my new bras.  HA! This weekend my cousins were visiting from San Diego, so I took them down to Valley Fair mall in Santa Clara—the upscale mall where they have Coach and Tiffany’s.  I got fitted for a bra, which I’d never bothered to do before.  I highly recommend that every woman does it—you might find that you’re not the size you’ve been buying all these years.  The past 18 months my weight has gone(mostly) up and down and I’ve fluctuated from a 34B up to a 36C.  I was starting to feel cinched in by my bra; when I got sized this weekend, I was told that I am now a 36D.  (Holla!)  I was thinking, “36D?  You mean I have Jessica Simpson boobies?”  (I only know what bra size she wears because I read too many trashy Cosmo type mags.)  I think the letter D just freaks me out—the boobage seems excessive.  When I look down at my chest, I don’t think my boobs look  that  big.  I’ve never been flat and I’m not ever going to have Pamela Anderson super-tits, but a C sounds more like me than a D.  Maybe I should rethink this “gotta drop some weight before my brother’s wedding” thing?  I’m just trippin’ off girl stuff.  ‘Scuse me.  Somewhere in this world someone will worship my breastesses (B, C or D cup) and appreciate that I pay top dollar for my bras.  And hey, at least I’m all natural!  (Mwahaha!)  Moving on…  The Hyphen party.  Sigh.  Me having the experience of putting on all sorts of events, I am always prepared for last minute everything to go wrong.  And everything DID go wrong, but the party went on…and I looked cute (cuteness is all that matters, right?) in my new outfit.  I was tugging at my top all night, but at least my boobs (it's all about my boobs, isn't it?) looked good, and Adrienne did my makeup.  Talk about hotness on Hyphen staff--all of us (staff is like 90% female) were cute.  At least I felt cute for a little bit.  Whether or not I really was cute, is relative.  But I think I shall invest in my own DJ set-up so I can not only mess around with records, but have my own equipment for DJ emergencies (to avoid all the last minute calling of DJs to bring needles or slipmats because the club didn’t provide that shit).  But enough of that.  Blah.  I drove my cousins Johanna, Jamie and Jeremy back to San Diego on Sunday (I flew back to SF late Sunday night).  It was my first time to do that drive (as the driver) from the Bay Area.  I did the drive in 7 hours, doing like 85-90 (at times 95).  The three youngsters slept in the car the whole trip.  I drank an energy drink (I forget what it was called, but it was half the size of a Red Bull, and tasted like a Sprite), a cup of coffee, and then (later on) half a Red Bull.  Didn’t feel tired at all during the drive, though at times I felt like my heart was going to burst out of my chest.  I stopped in Bakersfield, to visit Mama’s grave.  It was my first time to be back in Bakersfield since her ashes were buried in May.  I bought her a card and two bouquets of flowers.  I had barely spotted the headstone to her grave and I started bawling.  It was like at the mortuary chapel when we had her Last Mass/viewing—my cousins and I were the first ones to arrive and I only made it halfway down the aisle towards Mama’s open casket, when I started bawling.  For some reason I can’t talk to Mama out loud, like what I have to say to her is private (not that talking to her out loud or in general makes me feel silly).  I talk to Mama in my head and hope that she hears me.  I sat next to her grave, brushing the dirt off the headstone and arranging the flowers, talking to her in my head.  It really got to me that on the headstone, next to her name was my dad’s.  I don’t want to have to think about another death for at least 15 years.  In any case, I was all spoiled from Thursday to Sunday.  I had a rental car, because my car didn’t get fixed til Sunday.  My cousins and I were mobbing around in a white Chevy Trailblazer.  I thought it’d be about the same size as my Mitsubishi Montero Sport, but it was HUGE.  I’m really proud that I was able to maneuver the Trailblazer and its 270-horse power engine.  I truly felt like a shrimpy Asian girl who could barely see over the dashboard (I’m just a centimeter shy of 5’3”)—driving a big-ass car is like my Napoleon complex or some shit.  I like SUVs, even though I know they’re not gas efficient.  I grew up in white suburbia and my first car was my mom’s minivan, so anything smaller than a Toyota Camry just won’t do for moi.  Driving the rental car made me realize how old and uncool my car is, even though it’s a 1998 model.  I was like, “Keyless entry?  DOPE!  CD player?  OhmyfreakingGOD!”  My car doesn’t even have power locks or windows, because I was cheap and got standard everything.  But now standard  IS  keyless entry, power locks/windows, a CD player, etc.  Yeah, I cannot wait to get a new car.  I have other bills to take care of first.  Enough babble.  This girl’s got work to do.  Ugh.

      My Neck, My Back…   (7/14 note: I wrote this yesterday afternoon, with the intention of uploading it right away, but I got distracted and ended up saving it as a draft.)   Sheesh.  The fact that I am still recovering from my weekend (make that my whole week) must be a testament to how old I’m getting.  I know I’m “only” 25 (going on 26, come September), but…  Shit.  My back and neck still hurt, though not as bad as on Sunday.  Lately I’ve been having neck and back pain—if that doesn’t scream “old,” then I don’t know what does.  I don’t know if the cause is any of the following: bigger boobs (from weight gain), bad posture, or sleeping in a bad position.  But the pain can be seriously debilitating.  When it’s really bad, I’ll feel sore for 2-4 days and I can’t lean forward more than a 45-degree angle, I can’t turn my head, and sudden, jerky movements cause me pain.   Aray ko , for real.    Anyhow.  Flew down to San Diego out of SFO early Wednesday morning (last week).  Got picked up by my cousin Auren’s boyfriend and then dropped off at Auntie Erling’s and Uncle Johnny’s.  I got fed, watched TFC (The Filipino Channel) variety shows for a bit, and napped for like 2 hours, cozy in clean linens that used to be mine.  When I’m at Auntie Erling’s, Auntie Teten’s, or Auntie Baby’s house—I always spot some knick-knack, blanket/throw pillow, or piece of furniture that used to belong to my family (my mom).  When my dad and I were preparing for Mama’s death, we agreed that although I would inherit the house, my brother would move in and live there until he got married next year.  So Daddy and I put stuff into storage.  The things I didn’t want/need, I gave to my aunties.  Whenever I visit any of my auntie’s I’m always thinking, “Hey, I recognize that!”  When I was younger, all my cousins got my hand-me-downs (like this pink Huffy banana seat bike I used to love), so in a way I’m glad all of Mama’s things are still in the family (didn’t get thrown away).  I spent a little time with my dad at Auntie Teten’s before he went back to his hotel (when you’re old like my dad, and it’s not basketball season anymore, you don’t bother to stay up past 9:30 PM).  We ate  sinigang  (a seafood stew flavored with tamarind) and my dad lectured me for like 10 minutes about emailing him, or calling my aunties if I need anything while he’s in Japan. Afterwards, my cousins (Jamie and Johanna) and I went over to our other cousin (Warren)’s house in Chula Vista.  I should call him  Kuya  (big brother) Warren, huh?  (I hope Warren doesn’t mind that I don’t call him  kuya .)  Anyhow.  Warren’s mom and my dad are cousins, so I dunno what that makes Warren and me, but I’ll say cousins to keep it simple.  It’s all Ednalino blood.  Warren’s actually closer to my brother’s age (early 30s) and his younger brother (Dave) and I used to play together when our families were stationed in Virginia Beach in the mid-80s.  I remember we used to watch Captain Caveman and He Man on the USA Cartoon Express, and his mom (my Auntie Nenet) got me hooked on Bar None candy bars (I wish they still made those).  So yeah, if you haven’t figured it out already, I have a freaking huge family.  ON BOTH SIDES!  My dad is like the fourth oldest of ten; my mom was the oldest of (I think) 8.  Unfortunately I don’t know my Pasig (mom’s) side very well, so when I talk about my cousins, I mean all my Ednalino cousins (in Cali [San Diego and Milpitas]; I have some cousins in Hawaii and Australia).    Because some of my cousins have kids, and some of their kids are starting to have kids, I think I’m like a great aunt already.  Is that right?  I’ve never been able to figure out how all that lineage stuff works.  For example, is Robby, my  Kuya  Dong’s 19-year old son (an older cousin of mine), my nephew, or is he my second cousin?  Regardless, all the youngsters address me as  ate /big sister (“ah-teh”) anyhow.  Heaven forbid anyone calls ME “auntie” anytime soon.  Hell-fucking-no.  I didn’t grow up close to my family on either side.  Partly because when my dad was in the Navy, we got transferred around a lot, but mostly because my mom didn’t get along with her inlaws.  I saw my dad’s side every couple of years, after we moved back to California from Virginia in like 1989.  Before Mama passed away, the last time I’d seen my dad’s side of the family was when I was 19—when my  lola  (grandmother) died.  The last six weeks or so that Mama got really sick, up until she passed away, my dad’s family came by every weekend for almost a month straight.  Now we’re getting re-acquainted.  I feel like I’m making up for lost time.    Sometimes I say thought-prayers in my head to Mama and I tell her that although I know she didn’t get along with daddy’s sisters, I hope she isn’t mad at me for turning to them in her absence.  I am always loyal, but I love my aunties too.  It literally takes all of them to equal one of her.  Considering the tumultuous relationship Mama had with her inlaws, I think Mama would find it funny and ironic to hear me admit this.  But it’s true, and I know she would agree.  I have cousins I haven’t met yet, and cousins whose names I’m still trying to keep straight.  I have cousins nearing 50, and cousins still under 15.  It’s weird for me to have to address people as  kuya  (big brother) and  ate  (big sister), and to be addressed as  Ate  Audrey.  When my cousin Auren called me  Ate  a few months ago, I didn’t respond to her.  I didn’t think she was talking to me because I’m not used to being called that.  But now I like it.  Ednalino to me was always just my dad, my mom, my brother and me.  But now it’s this greater network of aunties and uncles and cousins, and being called  ate  makes me feel like I belong to a “club.”  I have crazy, loud aunties who cackle when they laugh, who have  bastos  (dirty) senses of humor; my uncles all kick it in the backyard, next to the barbecue grill, smoking too many cigarettes, drinking beer and Hennessey while eating  pulutan  (snacks); most of my younger cousins are girls and they’re all so HOT, I’m jealous.  Anyhow, I have things to do, so until next time!  I am going to look at all the Hyphen anniversary pics online and I won't forward you the links because I am so not photogenic (but I swear I was cute that night!).

      How cute.&nbsp; One of my former students, Fam Seng, IM'd me.&nbsp; She just got her first cell phone.&nbsp; (I was her mentor/tutor when she was 13.&nbsp; She'll be starting her senior year of high school in the fall.)&nbsp; I told her I'm moving back to the East Bay next week and she's excited like, "Can we have sleepovers again?"&nbsp; (I used to have all my girls over for sleepovers--that's probably the only reason they liked me.)&nbsp; She's got her driver's permit and she claims she's taller than me now.  Makes me feel so old!  Last night I gave Yuki a ride home after the Hyphen general meeting.&nbsp; After I dropped her off she called me, telling me she left her phone in her car.&nbsp; To be sure, I called it and I heard the chime/ring, but it took me forever to figure out where in my car it was because it fell inbetween the passenger seat and the middle console.&nbsp; I met&nbsp;Yuki downtown&nbsp;and dropped her phone off earlier this afternoon.  After last night's meeting I had a quick talk with Donna, to touch base on what her next project/s will be and what kinds of things she'd like to work on.&nbsp; Donna was just recently voted onto staff, after being a "fellow" (intern) for three/four months.&nbsp; She originally wanted to be on the Edit Team, but her background is in marketing, so she had a better "fit" with Business Team.&nbsp; She was officially voted on as my "assistant" (at least as far as marketing/publicity goes).&nbsp; It's strange--I've never had to manage anyone (not like this, at least).&nbsp; I tend to be a Control Freak who, as a result of her control-neuroses, spreads herself too thin.&nbsp; What I need to do, is give Donna the benefit of the doubt that she can complete whatever tasks I assign to her, and do them on deadline.&nbsp; I wear two hats for Hyphen, so when I'm busy with event crap, I need an assistant to pick up the slack with administrative duties for marketing/publicity projects.&nbsp; I should take Donna out for dinner/drinks every so often, so she doesn't feel like I'm just a Micro-Managing Taskmaster...  Blah.  I wrote Mel two checks last night--one to pay out the deposit to her outgoing roommate Barbara, and one for August rent made out to our landlord.&nbsp; It  hurt  me to part with that money; I kissed my two checks before I handed them to Mel.&nbsp; Like, "Bye-bye money!"&nbsp; But a week from now I am out of Pacifica!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp;  Tomorrow night&nbsp;a bunch of us will be hanging out with C.Fan (Chris Fan).&nbsp; Chris used to be with Hyphen, then&nbsp;he left for NYC for grad school.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;when I drink tomorrow, I don't feel all funky like I did at Milk Wednesday.&nbsp;  Okay, have a good weekend.&nbsp;

       White Men Can’t Dance    &nbsp;  Trebuchet MS is my favorite font.&nbsp; Do normal people have favorite fonts?&nbsp; It used to be Verdana, but now I think it's too wide.&nbsp; I'm a dork.    &nbsp;  Hyphen freaking general meeting tonight.&nbsp; Do you KNOW how much I HATE general meetings?&nbsp; (At least we don't have much&nbsp;of a biz team anymore, so we&nbsp;haven't had a biz team meeting in months.)&nbsp; I wanted to ditch tonight&nbsp;and go to Alameda--to hang out with Tim, Geraldine, Nina, Rachel and Steve (I used to call them the "594 Kids"), to ride around in Tim's new boat.&nbsp; I hadn't kicked it with all those kids (as a group--I always see everyone separately) in a loooong time.    &nbsp;  But I realized that tonight is our "post-mortem" (we go over and analyze) of our anniversary event and how can the Event Planner miss that?&nbsp; And then I also realized that I'm going to be moving in with the Editor In Chief next Thursday--there will be no missing of meetings or lying about something to do (when it's really just goofing off) from here on out.&nbsp; Mel will kick my ass, she's so hardcore!&nbsp; You don't wanna make her mad...&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; (Love ya, Mel!)    &nbsp;  Sigh.    &nbsp;  Anyhoo.    &nbsp;  Yesterday started out a bad day and ended with a fabulous Girls’ Night Out.  I checked my messages at the right time yesterday, because I got an email from my friend Marky about a party (his crew) Massive Selector was throwing at Milk for The Roots’ album release of  Tipping Point .&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn’t going to go; I was planning on going to this bar called Hush Hush tonight (after the Hyphen meeting), where Marky and my other friend Ren would be spinning.&nbsp; Then I thought, “Why not go to Milk?”&nbsp; So I called Adrienne and we were like, “Are you going?&nbsp; Do you want to go?”&nbsp; Then we were like, “If you go, I’ll go.”&nbsp; So we both went.&nbsp; And Hatty came with.&nbsp;   It was good.&nbsp; I got to touch base with Erik (the owner of Milk), who I’d been meaning to talk to forever, since Directions in Sound (it was at Milk this year).&nbsp; Right after the NAATA film festival ended, the following week I was in Bakersfield off and on til mid-May, so I never got to debrief with Erik about how he/we felt Directions In Sound went at Milk.&nbsp; And I want to talk to him about doing a birthday party/fundraiser in early October, too.  Erik was walking out and I was like, “Hey!” He stopped, smiled at me and said, “Give me a hug!”&nbsp; Hatty and Adrienne were like, “Whoa, Audrey!&nbsp; You go, mama!”&nbsp; (Erik’s totally fly, but he’s married with child.)&nbsp; Erik and I had a cigarette outside and we chatted a bit.&nbsp; He told me it was his birthday and I was like, “Happy Birthday!&nbsp; How old are you?&nbsp; 30?&nbsp; 32?”&nbsp; He was like, “33…”&nbsp; And so I said, “The same age Jesus was when he was crucified.”&nbsp; Erik was like, “See, that’s what I’m talking about.”&nbsp; It was such a random conversation that somehow ended up making sense.  Ade, Hatty and I started off the night with a round of Purple Hooters shots, on me.&nbsp; Then we posted in a booth along the wall, checking everyone out and grooving in our seats.&nbsp; Adrienne was like, “If you see anyone cute, point them out and I’ll rate them.”&nbsp; The only guy I thought was sort of cute/interesting, was this stocky Filipino guy wearing a Zoo York shirt and a neat hat, who was really grooving/singing along to the reggae/dancehall that Rob was spinning.&nbsp; Adrienne gave him a 7 and then said, “He looks like a nice person.&nbsp; He looks like he loves his mom very much.”&nbsp; More randomness.  Hatty bought Ade and I Long Island Iced Teas.&nbsp; She didn’t get a drink for herself because she saw the bartender grab like ten different liquors to make one Long Island, and it freaked her out.&nbsp; For good reason, too—that drink fucked me up.&nbsp; I was barely half-way when I started feeling like it was hard to breathe and my heart was beating faster.&nbsp; But I drank more and then stepped out to have a cigarette (“fresh air”).&nbsp; My tolerance is definitely not what it was just three or four months ago.  This band, I think they were called Alphabet Soup, played live and had two emcees and a DJ accompanying them.&nbsp; They were dope.&nbsp; They started playing when Ade, Hatty and I were in the ladies room, and I thought it was actually The Roots CD, but it was the band—they were that good.&nbsp;   There was this weird South Asian (maybe Middle Eastern) guy who was trying to infiltrate our dancing threesome all night.&nbsp; Ade, Hatty and I started out dancing where the bar turns into the dancefloor.&nbsp; We moved closer to the stage and were just grooving, and this strange guy (holding a beer and exclaiming, “Heeeeey!”) tries to freak me from behind.&nbsp; When I turn towards Hatty, he then tries to freak Adrienne.&nbsp; Basically, whenever he came close to our group, he’d try to freak all of us (one by one), or get in the middle of our dancing circle.&nbsp; At one point in the night, he was all, “Heeey!” and had one hand on mine and Hatty’s heads—I thought he was going to like stroke our hair or pat us on the heads like puppies.&nbsp; RANDOM.&nbsp; The guy tried to freak all three of us when Ade’s friend Alex was watching, and so he started laughing and walking away.&nbsp; Adrienne grabbed his arm and made him stand by us.&nbsp; He was like, “That’s why you need to bring someone to cock-block.”&nbsp; I was joking around like, “That’s my job—I’m protecting these two,” and he was like, “You?&nbsp; Suuuure.”&nbsp; Then he walked away again, leaving us near the crazy “Heeeey!” guy.&nbsp; So we went back to our original booth and sat there til we went home.  So like, what’s up with all the seriously OLD WHITE GUYS who were in attendance?&nbsp; Adrienne says the event was posted up on Craigslist, so maybe that’s a factor, but…&nbsp; It was “Play that funky music, whiteboy” night or some shit.&nbsp; White men can’t dance, I’m sorry.    Geez.&nbsp; When I finish this, that means I'm off to my meeting.&nbsp; I don't wanna go...

       Adjustment Period     &nbsp;   Since my weekend post about karaoke, I've been having this great exchange over email with Todd about fun songs to sing.&nbsp; All I have to say is, "We like the cars, the cars that go boom!"     &nbsp;   I almost forgot to mention that when Mel, Sorcha, Vette and I did karaoke last weekend, I tried my hand at "I Just Wanna Love Ya" by Jay-Z.&nbsp; Yes, folks, I tried to be both Jay-Z and Pharrell in the same song.&nbsp; It's quite hard when you have to be all, "...only if you ride nice dick" and then be all, "Gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff."     &nbsp;   Anyhow.     &nbsp;   It's only Wednesday, but I've been having a hard week.&nbsp; I noticed today, as I drove around running errands after work, that I really just wanted to cry.&nbsp; I was in rush hour traffic and all I wanted to do was stop my car, get out and sit in the backseat and cry in the privacy of tinted windows.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I was thinking about this joke Daddy played on Mama a few months ago.&nbsp; He was crouched down, tying her shoe for her, and he started doing the "ocho-ocho" dance.&nbsp; Unless you're Filipino, that's probably not funny.&nbsp; So far every day this week I've felt like crying because I miss Mama--because I think of something about her that I miss.     &nbsp;   I'm really scared for my birthday to come.&nbsp; Mama was always the first one to call me up and greet me.&nbsp; Mama's birthday card was always the first to arrive.&nbsp; I'm scared for Christmas to come--I'm still beating myself up over not spending Christmas in Bakersfield last year.&nbsp; I feel so guilty that Mama spent Christmas alone (with my  lola /grandmother) and I had an orphan's Christmas with my friends, because I figured I'd go home for New Year's anyhow.     &nbsp;   Everyone keeps telling me that this first year without Mama will be all about adjusting to her absence.&nbsp; I wish I didn't have to adjust period.

      Golden  &nbsp;  Woke up this morning to the TV blaring, because I feel asleep with it on last night.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; For some reason the TV was on ESPN (what&nbsp;did I watch last night?) and it was some final series for pool at a casino/resort&nbsp;in Connecticut.&nbsp; The two dueling it out, to move on to the final round, were both Filipino.&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't have my glasses on, but I heard the names Efren and Bustamante and I&nbsp;shot up in bed to see if my Filipino Radar is still on point.&nbsp;  Of course it is.   &nbsp;  Anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the best moment Friday afternoon.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After work I decided to treat myself to an ice cream cone.&nbsp; I was just sitting on a stool, watching people walk by, when the new Jill Scott song “Golden” comes on.&nbsp; I’m licking up my ice cream, grooving along, and then I bite into the cone—it tasted like fried chicken.  &nbsp;  I don’t know why, but I thought that was such a profound moment.&nbsp;  My ice cream cone tasted like fried chicken. &nbsp; Every once in a while I have my own strange semi-  American Beauty , plastic-bag-twirling-around-in-the-wind sort of moments that I think are really profound in their silliness.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   You're one weird-ass girl, Audrey.   &nbsp;  I got a call from Uncle Johnny this weekend.&nbsp; Now that Mama is gone and Daddy is in another country, I feel pretty lonely at times.&nbsp; It was nice of Uncle Johnny to call, “just to say Hi.”&nbsp; He put Auntie Erling on the phone and she addressed me as “Audeng” (sounds like “awww dang!”).&nbsp; My parents used to call me that—mostly Mama did.&nbsp; It makes me sad to think that Mama’s not here to call me that nickname anymore.  &nbsp;  There are a lot of things about Mama that I miss.&nbsp; I still can’t believe that she’s gone sometimes—it still feels like a strange dream that I should wake up from.&nbsp; And sometimes I feel guilty because I don’t feel sad 24-7 like I did the first two weeks after she passed away.&nbsp; Like I feel as if I should be super-depressed and sad and crying all the time to properly mourn her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I know there’s no blueprint to the mourning process—everyone goes through the motions in their own way, on their own time.&nbsp; The first two weeks after I returned from Bakersfield, after Mama passed away, I didn’t want to go out or talk to anyone.&nbsp; I wanted to cry all the time, and I probably cried at least once a day in those first two weeks.&nbsp; I was an anti-social hermit girl.&nbsp; I went to work and went home and watched TV til I fell asleep.&nbsp; Then I got busy with work and Hyphen and I was hanging out all the time.&nbsp; But as of last Sunday that phase ended, so now I’m sort of reverting to the watching-TV-til-I-pass-out phase.&nbsp; I don't like having time to feel sad, and my sadness manifesting in really unhealthy ways (neck pains, insomnia, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hope Daddy’s coping better.&nbsp;

      Axl Rose + Muppet/Fraggle = Melissa Hung  &nbsp;  Instead of going to see Spiderman 2 with Yvette last night, we did karaoke in Japantown with Mel and her friend (visiting from Houston) Sorcha (I hope I spelled that right).  &nbsp;  I met Mel and Sorcha in Oakland for a craft fair.&nbsp; I get tired of that whole dirty punk rock/artist scene real quick, but I came away with cool things (a turtle-shaped pin, a flower pin, and a pair of dangly earrings).&nbsp; Then we hung out in Lake Merritt, walking in and out of (overpriced) shops while drinking our iced coffees from Peet’s.&nbsp; Yvette met us at 7 PM for Cambodian food at Battambang, a restaurant I really like, that I had sworn off for about a year.&nbsp; (It’s half a block away from the art gallery a certain person [I don’t get along with anymore, who is an ex-friend and ex-roommate] works [or used to work] at.&nbsp; Don’t ask.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After dinner, we killed time at Mel’s (my soon-to-be home), trying to coordinate with people to join us for karaoke.&nbsp; More people, more fun, right?&nbsp; Melissa was like, “We should call Todd!”&nbsp; But then she was like, “But Todd’s really busy; he prob’ly wouldn’t come anyway.”&nbsp; I figure, Todd’s old (haha, Todd) and who in their right mind would drive all the way up to SF from San Jose just for karaoke anyhow?&nbsp; (Oh, but Todd is someone I would love to do drunken karaoke with.&nbsp; I know he’d be fun!&nbsp; Oliver Wang’s on my Karaoke Wish List, too!)  &nbsp;  While at Mel’s, Adrienne kept texting me, and I texted her back (I know, that’s just so Filipino of us).&nbsp; But then I got impatient, and at the urging of Mel, Vette and Sorcha, I finally called.&nbsp; It’s just so hard to coordinate among so many people.&nbsp; There was some party Stef was going to, that she and Adrienne wanted us to go to also, and the theme was to wear Puma and Adidas.&nbsp; But our foursome (Mel, Vette, Sorcha and moi) wasn’t in the socializing mood.&nbsp; We wanted to be “clique-ish” (inside joke for Mel, Stef, Adrienne, me and a couple other Hyphenators) and not have to make nice with strangers.&nbsp; So we crossed the bridge to have a round of drinks at Rohan (really cool soju bar) then karaoke’d our little hearts out for an hour and a half.  &nbsp;  Ohmygod!&nbsp; Melissa is the Hair Metal Karaoke Queen!&nbsp; I thought my friend Pete did the best Axl Rose, but Melissa fucking rocks because she’s a girl and she totally belts it out.&nbsp; I mean, I already adore Melissa, but now I have added respect for her karaoke skills.&nbsp; She did Skid Row (“18 &amp; Life”), Bon Jovi (“You Give Love A Bad Name”) and Guns N’ Roses (“Welcome To The Jungle”).&nbsp; Melissa was scoring really high, getting 93s and 98s.&nbsp; The song where she really kicked ass (“18 &amp; Life”) and should’ve scored 100, the machine scored her as a 0.&nbsp; I think she broke the karaoke machine with all of her talent.  &nbsp;  I was upset that the two songbooks we were choosing tunes from didn’t have any of my “signature” songs.&nbsp; No “When I Think of You” (Janet Jackson), no “Stay” (Lisa Loeb), no “Always” (Atlantic Starr), no “Tell Me Something Good” (Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan).&nbsp; I had to make do and rock some “Genie in a Bottle” by Christina Aguilera, “Never Gonna Give You Up” (Rick Astley—invoking the spirit of Gary Chou!) and “Careless Whisper” (George Michael—dedicated to Yuki).  &nbsp;  We ended the night with a group song—can’t remember if it was Journey or Foreigner but it was the “I wanna know what love is” song.&nbsp; We were all just screaming into the mics, we didn’t care.&nbsp; On the drive home, we were reeling off what BASIC songs the karaoke binders didn’t have (that they should have), and what songs would’ve been fun to do as a group.&nbsp; I saw “Bohemian Rhapsody” (Queen) in the binder, but was too intimidated to program it.&nbsp; Don’t front—you KNOW that would be fun to do.&nbsp; It must be that Filipino performer-mimic gene in me, but I loves me some karaoke.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Alright now, I gotta go return some impulse buys from Bath &amp; Body Works.&nbsp; (Who needs 3 scented lotions, even if they are $3.33 each?)

      Food Orgasm at Kenkoy’s  &nbsp; I've been getting&nbsp;complaints the past week that people can't/couldn't comment to my posts unless they&nbsp;had Blogs themselves.&nbsp; I fixed that, so if you're not a Blog member, you can post anonymously.&nbsp; I like the comments people have been forwarding to me, but I also think it'd be more fun to share them with whoever else reads this.&nbsp; Everyone (so far as I know) who reads my&nbsp;blog (I can&nbsp;only think of like&nbsp;five or six people who I know read it) is nice.&nbsp; :) &nbsp; Anyhow.&nbsp; I had the best breakfast/brunch in the whole wide world this morning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I’m always on this quest for good Filipino food because I haven’t had a chance to eat it on the regular in about five years (since my mom first got cancer).&nbsp; I guess it’s sort of a quest to recapture the food from my happy childhood, but more just seeking out a good Filipino food surrogate.&nbsp; You know—comfort.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I’ve eaten my dad’s cooking and my aunties’ cooking—but nobody cooks the way my mom did. &nbsp;If Mama was still alive, she would’ve been able to kick your mom’s ass in the kitchen with a  sandok  and  palayok , word up.  &nbsp;  I think I just might have found my most favorite Filipino café/restaurant.&nbsp; And that’s quite a thing to say, considering that I generally turn my nose at Filipino food establishments.&nbsp; I think a lot of Filipinos might feel the same way—that you shouldn’t bother eating Filipino food at  turo-turo  (literally “point-point” where the food sits pre-cooked, stewing under a heatlamp) mom-n-pop joints.  &nbsp;  This morning I had “longsilog” (pork sausage and eggs over garlic fried rice).&nbsp; It was super-duper nummies.&nbsp; Kenkoy’s don’t mess around—they cook your food to order.&nbsp; They even make the food all nice and pretty on the plate. &nbsp;That’s always been one of my biggest pet peeves with Filipino restaurants/cuisine (the food tastes good, but there’s no effort in presentation like at Thai or Vietnamese restaurants).  &nbsp;  The moment I bit into my food it was like the best first bite I’ve had in a long-ass time.&nbsp; I seriously had an orgasmic experience, tears could’ve fallen down my cheeks.&nbsp; My food looked better than the picture on the menu.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If anyone wants to go get breakfast (served all day) at Kenkoy’s in Pacifica with me, just let me know and I’m totally there.&nbsp; And it doesn’t hurt that Anton, the owner’s son who works the counter most of the time, is hella fine!&nbsp; He can be mybabydaddy, and I don’t usually like Filipino guys unless they’re exceptional!  &nbsp;  I need to try their  halo-halo ,   turon ,  sinigang  and  lechon  (can’t be Filipino and not eat pork!) before I wholeheartedly give them the title of Audrey’s Favorite Filipino Restaurant.&nbsp; But I already know their breakfasts are good, as are their  caldereta  (not cooked with goat, but beef) and  kare-kare  dishes.  &nbsp;Okay, I’m done raving.&nbsp; Wah!

      Bittersweet   NOTE: I was trying to upload this entry yesterday, but my computer was acting all screwy and it instead got saved to my Blog drafts.   My bad.  Second entry in one day, but…  Just so much going on.  Must comment.  I went into work this morning to tie up some loose ends since tomorrow is technically my last day.  I’d actually say today was my last day, but I’m going into the office (turn in my keys and pack up my desk) and I’m also getting paid for the day.  I made the decision this morning to just be a full-time student this semester.  I’m taking five classes (14 units), and I haven’t been in school for about a year. I really need to ease into the “academic environment” again and not have any time-consuming outside distractions (except for Hyphen and small freelance projects on the side [I’ve got some things planned, just you wait and see]).  I asked my dad for his input, because he’s in charge of a “trust” he and my mom set up before she died.  My brother and I are getting a small (I stress “small”) amount of money automatically deposited into our bank accounts monthly.  Our “inheritance” isn’t crazy, so don’t think I’m some rich/spoiled wannabe  haciendera  because I can afford to do/buy things I couldn’t before, and I inherited my mom’s jewelry and land in the Philippines.  Her jewelry/things and land are things I hold onto for sentimental value—because they are what’s left of her and I have a right to them.  But as far as actual money, I am  kuripot /frugal (stingy) where it counts (and generous, I hope!) and I am researching avenues of investing.   Let’s just say that because of all this, I finally have the opportunity to be a full-time student—to finish the coursework left for me to get my undergraduate degree.  Daddy said I should just be a full-time student not only for this semester but until I finish.  I have three more semesters left (including this fall).  I’m all for playing the part of full-time student fall semester, but I’m not so sure about spring and next fall.  I could get antsy about not having something to balance out Hyphen and studying.  I like working, only because I’ve found what I like to do and what I’m good at.  But I feel like I made a really HUGE decision today.  I think I deserve it.  I made a lot of sacrifices when Mama got sick; I put off school every time my parents needed me to be at home.  At the time I resented it, but in retrospect I wouldn’t trade that time for anything else in the world.  When we found out Mama only had months left back in March, she made me promise to get my undergrad degree—to stop putting it off after she passed away.  Out of every promise I ever made to her, this is the most important.  I don’t feel any regret, nor do I feel “behind” anymore.  I used to get down on myself about hitting my mid-20s and not being done with college yet.  I almost gave up on the thought that I could ever go to grad school.  I even used to resent Mama for being sick, because of all the “wasted time” I took off to take care of her.  But now that she’s gone, I realize how young and lucky I am.  The only bittersweet thing is that Mama won’t be there on my graduation day.  (Typing that just made me want to cry.  Wow.)  Anyhow, gotta go.  Gotta reserve a rental car for Saturday, then head to Oakland to pick up the keys to my new home from Mel.  Then we’re going out for dinner.  Yay!

      Stef Says I Talk Funny  Watching:  CB4  on Comedy Central&nbsp; (This film is almost as funny as  Fear of a Black Hat   Last night’s screening of  Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle  was crazy.&nbsp; I was in line with Yvette, Adrienne and Ade’s friend John.&nbsp; As it was, I didn’t think we’d make it in, much less Mel and Hatty (who were still outside).&nbsp; Vette, Ade, John and I sat in the 3rd row (center), so I was surprised that Mel and Hatty got in and sat in front of us.&nbsp; Mel pulled rank and was like, “I’m the editor of Hyphen and we’re one of the sponsors!”&nbsp; (Insert evil laugh here.)&nbsp; I’m too afraid to pull rank and drop names to get my way…unless it’s at my own event and I have to put someone in their place.&nbsp; (I always get people who don’t realize who I am, claiming to be important and on the guest list.&nbsp; My philosophy is, “If you really were important, you’d already be on the guest list.”)  Back to the film.&nbsp; Just as I came out of  Coffee & Cigarettes  wanting a  yosi /smoke really bad, I had a craving for White Castle.&nbsp; If you’re wondering what I thought, the film wasn’t that bad.&nbsp; It was better than I expected and it was funny (low brow humor).  I saw Scott.&nbsp; At the screening I saw/ran into a lot of people I know through “community” (the “Asian American media/arts community”).&nbsp; I waved Scott over to where I was sitting and we chatted.&nbsp; Initially I was in “Hyphen mode,” wanting to get the ball rolling on this arrangement Hyphen made with APAture/Kearny Street Workshop (the organization Scott works for), but Scott sidetracked and brought up my mom.&nbsp; I think he heard from Truong (my friend, his boss) about my mom passing away.  Scott had a hard time looking me in the eye and I think it was because he felt uncomfortable talking about death.&nbsp; But I realized that I wasn’t uncomfortable anymore.&nbsp; Now that it’s been two and a half months since Mama died, it’s easier for me to talk about it and to hear other people tell me they’re sorry.&nbsp; In the first month after Mama passed away, I just wanted everyone in the world to know how heartbroken I was—how much her death changed (and would change) my life (and my dad’s and brother’s lives).&nbsp; I wanted to yell and throw shit in an angry fit—even punch walls and people.  And I am sorry to say that I went through a couple of weeks where I was angry and hurt by certain friends, if they hadn’t told me they felt sorry for me or offered shoulders to cry on.&nbsp; But I understand that everyone who knows me and knows about the 4+ years I dealt with my mom having cancer, and now her death—they all empathize with me regardless of if they’ve been vocal about it.&nbsp; It’s that whole “more than words” cliché.&nbsp; Sometimes people don’t know what to say, so they don’t say anything at all.&nbsp; I can’t say that silence is golden in this case, but I understand.   Anyhow.&nbsp; I totally forgot that my friend Stef was in Boston.&nbsp; I brought a gift for her to the screening, thinking she’d be there.&nbsp; I ran into her boyfriend Paul and pawned her gift onto him since I was tired of holding it.&nbsp; I hope Stef gets the present okay, because after the screening I didn’t see Paul holding the box anymore…that’s an expensive gift.&nbsp; (I saw this “fanny pack” thing at Sunhee Moon and I wanted to buy it for Stef, but I didn’t imagine it’d be real leather and cost $91.) &nbsp;But Stef is definitely worth it; if you met her you’d think so, too.  Moving on.&nbsp; Do I talk funny?&nbsp; As in, do I have an accent?&nbsp; I’ve been told that Californians have an “international” sort of accent—that because Cali is so multi-cultural, there really isn’t any noticeable “native” accent (except of course the Valley Girl/Surfer Dude).&nbsp; I once dated a Canadian who told me I had an accent when I said certain things; I thought he was trippin’ because he said “aboot.”&nbsp; Saturday night Stef pointed out to me that sometimes I pronounce my flat A’s with an A that’s inbetween the A in “cat” and the A in “spa.”&nbsp;   I told her it’s probably just because I grew up all over (Navy brat), so how I speak is a mix of all the places I’ve lived (accents I’ve heard).&nbsp;  Or , it could be my residual FOBby Filipino-ness.&nbsp; Sometimes I FOB out (say things in broken English or with a slight Filipino accent), especially after I’ve spent a lot of time with my family.&nbsp; Plus, I make an effort to articulate Spanish and Tagalog (and any other “ethnic”) words with the correct pronunciation.&nbsp; I don’t like to Americanize (mutilate) “ethnic” words, as much as possible.  &nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Gotta meet Yuki and Neda for lunch.&nbsp; I’m hopping on BART—I am getting reacquainted with BART since I’ll be a commuter (“bridge &amp; tunnel”) once I move to Oakland.

      “Take That, Rewind It Back…”  Wow.&nbsp; I was given notice yesterday that I am being laid off at my nonprofit admin job.&nbsp; Budget cuts--the money that's allocated to pay me is instead going to hire/pay someone with more tech experience.&nbsp; (I was a "membership services assistant" who processed memberships and did data entry.&nbsp; Our servers were always crashing and I ain't no techie, so...you do the math.)&nbsp; And then my "contract" with the PR firm is up in a few weeks.  I'm back to being unemployed.&nbsp; But then again, that's okay.&nbsp; I just paid for my classes for fall semester and I'm taking a full load--14 units (5 classes).&nbsp; It's been a long-ass time since I was in a position where I had the time/could afford to take a full load of classes.&nbsp; For the first time I'm not hurting for money, either.&nbsp; I'm debating on whether or not I should look for part-time work, or just be a full-time student fall semester--classes start in about 3 weeks.  Anyhow.  Hyphen is a sponsor for tonight’s sneak preview of  Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle .”&nbsp; I will be&nbsp;at the Metreon&nbsp;to represent with&nbsp;other Hyphenators and my friend Yvette. &nbsp;Surprisingly, Ebert and whoever-that-skinny-guy-is gave the film "two thumbs up."&nbsp; I am not sure what to think of&nbsp;Hyphen sponsoring an Asian American version of  Dude, Where’s My Car? .&nbsp; I mean, it stars the MILF guy (John Cho from  American Pie )…&nbsp; And then I read an article about  She Hate Me , the upcoming Spike Lee film.&nbsp; I can’t wait to see it (along with  Garden State ).&nbsp; My most favorite film of all time, is  Crooklyn .&nbsp; Oh, and I saw  Napoleon Dynamite  last week!&nbsp; You have to see it!  This morning I woke up with Bob Marley’s “Could You Be Loved” in my head.&nbsp; I cannot remember the dream, but I remember that song was in my dream.&nbsp; It’s a refreshing change, considering that my mind has been bombarded with Usher and radio music I don’t especially like.&nbsp; (“Take that, rewind it back/Urshur got the voice to make the booty go…”)&nbsp; Yesterday I had Juvenile (“Ungh!&nbsp; I like it like that…slow motion for me…”) in my head.&nbsp; Last week I had “It’s Raining Men” and “Toxic” (by Britney Spears) in my head.&nbsp; I was told that one surefire way to get annoying songs out of your head, is to start singing “Viva Las Vegas.”  After leaving the admissions office at school, I went to the mall to buy some more makeup.&nbsp; I've been a Makeup Whore since Mama passed away--just buying and buying.&nbsp; It seems the older I get, the more makeup I feel I need to use to cover up the signs of aging.&nbsp; I know I’m only 25, but since I was about 20 I’ve felt so much older than my friends who are around my age solely because of the experiences I’ve had and the things I’ve had to do for myself.&nbsp; In my early 20s I went through a period where I would get four hours of sleep a night, work, take late afternoon/night/weekend classes, and/or work a second job/internship, and party it up just as hard.&nbsp; I can’t do that anymore—the age and fatigue show on my face.&nbsp; Hence, more makeup.&nbsp; Now I have to wear under eye concealer and use anti-wrinkle cream.&nbsp; The “beauty regimen” gets more complicated with age.&nbsp; I remember when I was in my teens, I thought 25 was old.&nbsp; Now that I’m 25 and getting closer to 30/40, 30/40 seem pretty damn young.  Oh yeah.&nbsp; When I was speaking to Donna (my assistant for Hyphen) after the general meeting last week, she interrupted me while I was in the middle of saying something.&nbsp; She was like, “Oh my God, I’m just so mesmerized by your eyes.”&nbsp; I played it off and got all diva, like, “Oh, thank you!” and batted my eyelashes.&nbsp; I sort of felt validated because that same afternoon I went to Sephora to buy this eye shadow base and I re-did my makeup before the Hyphen general meeting.&nbsp; I felt like the $18 I spent was well worth the money.&nbsp;   If you only knew how much money I’ve spent at Sephora and MAC since May, you’d bug out.&nbsp; Those joints are like candy stores to me.&nbsp; And I just love having the girls who work the counter, apply makeup on me--eye shadow is the only way you'll get my ass to wear pink.  Now I'm going to go walk around and feel cute because I'm all did up, wearing my new corduroy blazer, low-cut top&nbsp;and tight-ass black pants.&nbsp; HOLLA!

       Vegans Aren’t Balut-iful  Didn’t get a chance to meet Mel and her family for dinner last night.&nbsp; I got stuck at the Laundromat waiting for my clothes because the first dryer I used was broken and I had to wait for one that worked.&nbsp; Boo.&nbsp; I felt bad because I know Mel wanted someone to “save” her from her parents and keep her company.  Anyway.&nbsp; When Mel’s friend Sorcha was in town, the three of us shared a vegan banana nut muffin.&nbsp; We each had a small taste and then it got tossed in the trash.&nbsp; The other day, I was curious and tried “vegan macaroni & cheese.”&nbsp; It, too, got tossed in the trash.&nbsp; I guess it’s safe to say that vegan = tasteless.  My freshman year of college, I was a vegetarian.&nbsp; I went home one time and my mom fed me  pancit  (stir fried noodles) with chicken (saying, “Just a little bit won’t hurt”).&nbsp; From that moment on I was a rehabilitated carnivore.&nbsp; I will never again give up meat.  I like to eat my pho with rare beef, tripe, and tendons.&nbsp; That’s the only way to do it.&nbsp; I don’t mind organ meat.&nbsp; You can’t be Asian and not eat pork or some kind of organ meat.&nbsp; Asians do not waste any part of the animal.  I like to eat  papaitan  (a stew made with bile and tripe) and  kare-kare  (oxtail, tripe and veggies, stewed in a peanut sauce).&nbsp; One of my best friends, Yvette, is half  Kapampangan  (her dad is from  Pampanga  province).&nbsp;  Kapampangans  are known for their  longanisa  (sweet pork sausage) and discriminating appetites.&nbsp; Yvette picks on me like, “You’re half  Ilocana , that’s why you eat some nasty shit.”&nbsp; But Yvette likes  lengua  (tongue), and I refuse to eat anything that can taste me back.&nbsp; So we’re even.&nbsp; ( ’Day, magkapareho din tayo, di ba? )  Growing up, I was disgusted by how my mom and dad would eat shrimp.&nbsp; They’d pluck the head off first, and suck the brains out, claiming, “It’s de best part!”&nbsp; My dad would suck the eyeballs of fish.&nbsp; He eats fish heads fast and clean like a pro.&nbsp; Nowadays when I visit my Auntie Baby and we eat shrimp  kamayan  style (with your hands, like a peasant), I suck on shrimp heads too.&nbsp; I wouldn’t say it’s the “best” part, but it’s definitely where the flavor is.&nbsp;   I also used to be really horrified at the thought of eating  balut .&nbsp;  Balut  is a fertilized duck egg that is 17-19 days old.&nbsp; It’s supposed to be an aphrodesiac (makes men strong/virile), and is generally eaten as  pulutan  (a snack) with beer.&nbsp; In May my Auntie Thelma flew out from Australia to help Daddy and I take care of Mama until she passed away.&nbsp; We stayed up into the night, taking shifts.&nbsp; Since Daddy and I didn’t sleep much, Auntie Thelma had me buy  balut .&nbsp; I’d always wanted to try it, but was too chicken shit (no pun intended) to try, so Auntie Thelma finally taught me how.   Balut ’s not that bad.&nbsp; The key is to not scrutinize what you’re eating (so eat as fast as you can).&nbsp; And to use salt.&nbsp; Basically you boil the duck egg, crack the pointy top just a little, and sip out the  sisiw  (fluid).&nbsp; Then you peel off/down the shell as you eat.&nbsp; If you’re lucky enough to get  balut  that’s 17 days old, then there’s no biting into barely formed beaks, feathers and feet.&nbsp; It really tastes like chicken…just slightly funkier. &nbsp;I believe I am a true Filipino now, now that I’ve tried  balut .&nbsp; Back in the day, Taek would say he’s more Filipino than me because he’d eaten  balut  and I hadn’t.&nbsp; He’d say he’s more “ balut -iful” than me. &nbsp;(Not anymore Korean Boy!)

      Cigarettes, Lubrication & Scandal  Saw Chris Fan last night.&nbsp; It was good to see him.&nbsp;   At the party, all of us Hyphen folk were being “clique-y” and not socializing outside of our circle.&nbsp; Ade, Mel, Stef, Hatty, and I were kicking it on the deck out back the whole night, talking to Albert, Alex, Jason and Paul (guys involved with Hyphen, the guys who came with us).&nbsp;   I got pretty tipsy (after a Jell-o shot and rum & coke).&nbsp; One point in the night I told Adrienne and Hatty, “Watch this.”&nbsp; I wanted to show off.&nbsp; Drink in hand, I sauntered up to Jason, tugged on his shirt and yelled, “GIMME CIGARETTE!”&nbsp; (It was the second time I’d done that to him that night.)&nbsp; He was like, “Damn, here you go!&nbsp; What are you?&nbsp; Korean or something?”&nbsp; That got Hatty riled up, “What are you trying to say about Koreans?”&nbsp; But I was just trying to prove a point—Jason takes my shit, even though I’m a foot shorter than him and he can stomp on me.&nbsp; We’re like the Odd Couple.&nbsp; And I like to be loud/obnoxious sometimes when I’m drunk, because I can play it off and still be cute.  I am so excited.&nbsp; I’m making a trip to Australia and the Philippines (possibly Thailand and Malaysia) next summer.&nbsp; It looks like Hatty’s going to be my traveling companion!!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; We’ll have so much fun!&nbsp; I’m trying to convince Adrienne to go.&nbsp; I want Mel to come with, if she has some vacation time to spare.&nbsp; Yay some more!  Mr. Todd Inoue is serious about his karaoke.&nbsp; This (and the fact that Todd carries around this really cool Japan Airlines bag) makes Todd my new “superhero” over O-Dub.&nbsp; (Todd, this is where we make rice eating gestures and dance  kulintang , haha.&nbsp; I loved your article on Chad Hugo--especially that picture of you with the "Hey Chad, I'm Filipino too!" sign.)&nbsp;   Mel and I want to organize Karaoke Night for Hyphen staff.&nbsp; My friend Brent used to be involved as a consultant, but now he’s more active.&nbsp; I remember him asking me, “So, who are all the cool kids?&nbsp; Who do you hang out with on staff?”&nbsp; That’s when I realized that new staff and interns probably think some of us are “clique-y” (which we are)—which means we need STAFF BONDING.&nbsp; What better way than drunken karaoke?&nbsp; (Plus, Mel, Mia, Stef, and I just want to saaang.)&nbsp; This also reminds me that it’s time we had a staff retreat, too.&nbsp;   I finally watched The Surreal Life on VH1.&nbsp; Friday night I watched all episodes as I packed up 80% of my belongings in preparation for my move to Oakland.&nbsp; Ron Jeremy, bighairypornstar, has a pet turtle.&nbsp; That’s all I have to say about him.&nbsp; Trishelle, from Real World Las Vegas?&nbsp; I can’t stand to watch her—it makes me want to get violent (dropkick her in her neck, smack her upside her head, pull her hair out, etc.).&nbsp; It’s so funny how I can feel so strongly about someone, based on how they show portrays them.&nbsp;   OMG!   My landlord finally found someone to occupy my room when I move.&nbsp; In the midst of packing up my bathroom I realized that, when he was showing my room to prospective tenants, if anyone happened to look at my bottom shelf of toiletries and beauty products, they would’ve seen this trial size bottle of Astroglide I got from Good Vibrations.&nbsp; (Laughing my ass off.)&nbsp;  SCANDALOUS!   On to something more mundane…&nbsp; Can I just say how much I love  tsinilas /flip-flops?&nbsp; I already have that summer flip-flop tan on my feet and I love it.  Okay, gotta go to Home Depot then rush back home and shower because I'm meeting Melissa and her family (her parents and little brother are in town from Houston) for dinner.&nbsp; Melissa's not my girlfriend or boyfriend, but meeting a friend's/soon-to-be roommate's parents is a big deal.&nbsp; Eek.

       Superfreaky, YOW!      I was stuck in traffic on the 580, on my way back home from Fry's in Fremont--I heard on the radio that Rick James was found dead at his home this morning.  Died in his sleep of natural causes.  As soon as I got home I got online to read about it on the news.      I wonder what Dave Chappelle has to say about it...bitch.      Anyway, I have a USB cable to finally hook my printer up to my computer and dinner to cook. (I'm making  tinolang manok  [chicken with chayote and spinach] and rice.  Yum.)  Hope you all have great weekends.  Mel's speaking at a NAAAP conference tomorrow and I'm tagging along, then Sunday I'm having Stef (and Paul), Adrienne (and Jon), Hatty and Yvette over for dinner.  I haven't cooked for anyone since May.

      Audrey In Animation   urlLink     Sorry. Lolo/Grandpa Monchichi was just a test. Blogger's all confusing with how you put up pics and whatnot--you have to download this messaging-like publisher called Hello to do it for you (which I think sort of sucks).  Anyhow.  Remember that site I mentioned that lets you make a Buddy Icon of yourself? (Go here: illustmaker.abi-station.com/index_en.shtml)   All Hyphen staff made icons of themselves and you can see them on the masthead of issue 4 (but mine's not there--I was in Bakersfield at the time).  But I wanted to try one out anyhow; we're suposed to have our icons replace our staff pics on the Hyphen bio page online.  I didn't think my original .gif looked like me (the hair was parted to the wrong side and too short), so I tried again. Now I'm more satisfied. It's Audrey in animation! Cute, huh?  Now go make  Buddy Icons of yourselves!    urlLink

       An Elephant Never Forgets  Listening to:  Midnight Marauders  - A Tribe Called Quest  I finally washed FIVE freaking loads of laundry yesterday afternoon.       I was at the laundromat reading my trashy magazine (Allure) with Natalie Portman on the cover and turned around to look at the clock on the wall. I glimpsed a familiar face--I thought it was this girl I was really good friends with in high school, Michelle. I couldn't forget her--she was a tiny Korean girl who was an inch or two shorter than me, had a cute round face and brown hair, and the sweetest little voice. I dunno, I figured I was imagining things and I went back to my magazine. But then I had to walk out to my car to get bleach and fabric softener and I noticed the car parked next to mine was the same exact Toyota Corolla that Michelle and her sister used to drive in high school. The license plate frame said "Bill Wright Toyota" and "Bakersfield." I knew it was her.  So what did I do?  Shit.  I fought the urge to go up to her and awkwardly ask her if she might recognize me, then tell her who I am, and ask her how she's doing, etc. Realizing that I was too lame to do that, made me hide behind my trashy magazine even more. What's really funny is that the last time I was living in Oakland I thought I walked past her on Grand Avenue, but it happened so fast, I wouldn't have been able to run after her and have that awkward moment, even if I'd wanted to. Now I realize that probably  was  her who walked past me.  Now you may ask why I didn't do anything at the laundromat... Well, I've had the experience once before that I ran into someone I went to high school with, someone who hung out in my circle of friends but I just lost touch with. Well, I re-introduced myself to that person and they totally blanked on me. It's not that I looked different, but they didn't even remember my name. Like I disappeared from all the past experiences we had together--erased. And suffice it to say that my ego was actually crushed--I actually thought, "How can you not remember  ME ?  I'm AUDREY, DAMMIT! " (For real, though. I know there are a ton of Filipino Audreys out there, but there are only a handful of Ednalinos in this world. And there's only one  ME .)  But yeah, back to my story. I didn't want to have to be disappointed that someone I was as close to as a sister when I was a junior and senior in high school might not remember me.  Sigh .  It only makes me wonder...those of you reading this, those of you who know me... Will I always be remembered? Is it any consolation knowing that  I  won't forget even if  you  do?  On a totally different note...  I am still getting those annoying before 8 AM calls from that "unavailable" number. In fact, that shit woke me up yesterday morning.  Blah.

       Love Those Hons!      I feel bad. One of my friends who I work on Hyphen with was talking to me on AIM, wanting to discuss Hyphen internal biz stuff and I wasn't in the mood to chat about it. I freaking live in the Hyphen Apartment with Melissa--the issue 1 cover is up as artwork on our living room wall, we have a huge hall closet dedicated to housing Hyphen shit... The two of us try not to talk about it casually, so we don't burn ourselves out.      I just walked back and forth between the kitchen and my room/desk so I wouldn't get caught up. I also didn't want to be rude and be all, "You know what? Can we not talk about Hyphen right now?"    Anyhow.      I wish I'd taken a "before" picture of my room to show you how fucking chaotic it looked with random shit strewn all over the floor, boxes, styrofoam and bags of clothes. Today my room pretty much looks like I envisioned it to look. I'm not done, but no more piles of junk on the floor. Everything's put away except for the last of my clothes and papers that need filing.      It was sort of hard sifting through certain boxes. I got caught up looking through old photo albums that I took from Bakersfield, with the intention of buying new albums and re-arranging the photos. Lots of photos of Mama and it made me a little sad to look at them and miss her. I also found a few articles of clothing I "stole" from her closet before Daddy and I donated all her belongings to Good Will. I picked out some photos to put on my nifty magnetic bulletin board strip--most of them pics of my parents.   Some days I'm fine, and some days I feel really empty and heartbroken, missing my mom.     Trevor called me the other day and he was like, "I know how it is. It comes and goes, but it's always there." His father died when he was still a teenager (I think). Trevor met Mama last summer, too.     Sigh.      Last night I took a break from the process of unpacking and went to Berkeley to hang out with three of the Hon siblings (my friends Tim, Rachel and Phil) and Nam. We watched  Starsky & Hutch  at Tim's grandmother's apartment. She wanted to watch the movie with us and Tim and all them were trying to coax her into going to bed. They were like, "It's a bad movie. It'll give you nightmares. Go to sleep--you want me to tuck you in?" They're grandmother's so cute--they imitate her accent the way I like to imitate my parents' and aunties'/uncles' accents. It was good to see Tim and all them--it was the first time for me to see Tim in over a year; the first time to see Rach in almost two years. I was surprised to see Phil all grown--I first met him when he was like 13/14, running around barefoot, and now he's probably 18 or 19 and taller than Tim!       I love the Hon Family--their house was like my Angel Island when I first moved up to the Bay Area from LA. Ah, memories.

       Hello from my beautiful new Oakland home! :-)      You probably guessed that I finally set my new desk up and hooked up my computer. (Don't tell the guys who live upstairs, but Mel and I are piggybacking [stealing] their wireless Internet. Shhh! [That just means money I would've spent on Internet will now go to digital cable, ha!]) All I did was plug in my wireless USB adapter and  VOILA! , I'm online. WAH!       So here's an update to tide you over til I finish unpacking, etc...      Mel told me before I moved in that there's a youngster (undergrad at Berkeley) who lives above us (his room is above mine) who used to give her and her old roommate problems. He'd play bass and drums loud, play his music loud, have loud sex... He hasn't been a problem for a while, because Mel and Barbara (her old roomie) would go upstairs and knock on the door and complain. But Mel and I ran into him the other day on our way out (to Target for some shopping) and she was like, "Oh, Brian, I want you to meet Audrey. She just moved in with me." She said how she thinks we should all sit down and come up with some common courtesy rules about noise control. I agree. I'm going back to school (I have two weeks of freedom left!) and I'm not trying to be all gangster and walking my ass upstairs to curse that fucker out because I can't study.       But the loud sex thing? I'm not tripping off that. I've had roommates with skanky One Minute Man boyfriends--I've heard rhythm-less bed-banging. (Don't know what's worse, no rhythm or no stamina/endurance?) I think Brian-Who-Lives-Upstairs is a Ten Second Brother (but he sounds like he's got a little rhythm). I heard some bad-banging at like 2 AM this morning--I mentally timed it and it seriously didn't go on for too long. In my head I was like, "BOO! I feel sorry for whoever's lying underneath you all unsatisfied right now! BOO SOME MORE! BOOOOOO!" The least he could've done was go for a second ten-second round, but he didn't.        Look at me, talking shit already about the neighbors.  But it's okay. The really good loud-sex noises will be coming from my room soon (haha).      Anyhow!      I moved in the first wave of my things on Friday afternoon/evening. Then Mel and I headed to Ikea to do some shopping for a TV/media stand. I actually wanted to furnish my room Crate & Barrel or Pottery Barn style, just because I didn't want to get callouses from building my furniture (I really moved in with little in terms of furniture [just a desk chair, bookcase and a mattress]), but I shall have an Ikea room, too. My new furniture (dresser, bedframe, desk, chair) has cost me a little over $400. It's not so bad--I'm just not down with the raw wood look, so I need to stain/varnish my shit so it doesn't look so cheap (haha!).      Saturday I rented this crazy "luxury" minivan (is there such a thing?) and drove solo to Bakersfield to fetch boxes out of my storage space. (It was a daylong mission. I drove down, got my shit, then drove back up. I left the Bay Area around noon and returned about 9 PM.) When Daddy and I packed up our house so Junior (my brother) could move in, I marked about 4 boxes with the letters "SF" on them, so I could easily spot them when I went to retrieve them. Unfortunately Daddy and my uncles put some of those boxes in the far back of the storage space, behind big furniture that I'm too weak to move, so I only came back with 2 boxes (none of which had any kitchen stuff that I wanted/needed).  The trip wasn't bad at all. I rocked out to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake the whole way down (I made sure to bring CDs that made me want to either dance or sing along so I wouldn't fall asleep.) I ate In-N-Out at my half-way pit stop.  And I visited Mama's grave. Instead of flowers, this time I brought her a turtle. I was annoyed that I had to cut my visit/talk short, though. The sprinklers were on at the cemetery, so I got caught a couple times as it went around and around. I think my mom understands why I had to cut my visit short. Before I left, I told Mama about my move and how she would like both Mel and my new home.     Sunday afternoon Hatty, Mel, Adrienne and her friend (visiting from Australia) John, helped me move the very last wave of things from Pacifica to Oakland. The biggest pain in the ass was my mattress. I had no problem transporting that shit from SF to Pacifica (shorter distance, and I had more rope to work with), but this time around it was a nightmare. We dropped Hatty off at BART in Colma, retied my mattress, stopped off at In-N-Out in Daly City, stopped at Serramonte Mall and instead reshifted boxes to squeeze my mattress into Ade's minivan, then we were on our way.      Anyhow, let me go. I need to run errands. I need to mail Jeremy his present so maybe it will arrive in Philly in time for his bday, and (EEK!) rush Hatty on a flyer design so I can get Hyphen flyers made for the AAJA Unity Conference for Todd and Ursula in DC this whole week/end.      I need to get my shit in order for the Hyphen meeting Thursday. Ugh!
