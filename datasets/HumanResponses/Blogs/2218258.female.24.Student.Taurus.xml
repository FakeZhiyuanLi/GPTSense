      Hello! ;)  Ok.. my first post got eaten away... by the shift button.. hrphm...  Well, first of all.. my disclaimer.. :P I would like to apologize if I'm intruding in any sort of way.. I'm not sure if I can post in the blog as a player.. or if i'm even allowed to post *gasp*.. Also, I apologize if someone ever gets offended by any remark or off-comment I make -- if anyone does, aim me ;) and we'll chat  ok! Well, Kat mentioned that we have a full house :P I was wondering, how can you send invites? I was trying to figure out how to send invites.. But i couldnt do it. So I'm wondering, Kat, can you send an invite to Geoff?  Ah, about the characters. Well, I'm going to be creating a 1-lvl character (just like Kat did). And if anyone ever needs help creating one, feel free to aim me @ fr2nc1z . I personally don't think it would be a good idea to post a how-to-create-a-character in a blog because a lot of it depends on the character and the player. That's why I'm volunteering my time to help ppl out :P hehe. Anyhow, obviously, this would be a decision made by ppl -- and ah, I dont read ppl's minds (even tho it would be the coolest power to have!). So it's up to you guys :)  Oh, and I was also thinking that we could have people comment on a post.. or something.. so we know what everyone is thinking about playing (no point in having 7 rogues - even tho it would be hilarious.... ***gets an idea*** Hey! Maybe I'll be a rogue too!! And then we can ALL be rogues..... no, but seriously... ummm... well, maybe it wouldnt be so bad :P).  Anyhow, those are my 2 cents.. Let me know what you think :)

      Okay okay I promise I'm not going any further with that...  Anyway, hi, I'm Harry your (hopefully) beloved and (probably) feared DM. Kat was kind enough to set up this blog for us, and I would like to thank and commend her for that.  Now, she has made mention of a basics of character creation post on this blog. I am not going to undertake that project, and I am going to ask that no one else yet attempt it either. Although to we who are experienced it may seem a simple - even effortless - process to crank out level one characters like cheap lead soldiers (as indeed level one characters are), I must point out that to most people who have never held a PHB (that's Player's HandBook for our truely new initiates), it can be overwhelming, especially if you get some wannabe instructor's halfassed Reader's Digest version.  That said, I will go through character creation with anyone and everyone who needs it upon such time as we know who is going to be in our group. Currently, I have the list as myself, Kat (Kathleen from NJ, who I will call Kat to differentiate her from her friend Kathie who lives... somewhere else - please forgive me for forgetting), Kathie (the aforementioned friend of my friend who I hope will soon be my friend), and Francis (another friend of Kat's who I hope will soon by my friend).  And so it does come to pass that we have... three PCs and a DM. Blah. Harumph. In a word, crap. We need more people. That's your first bit of homework, go get more players. I want at least six PC (that is, Player Characters) in this game before I start it. I'm trying to find people among my friends, but most of my friends aren't newbies and refuse to come to my call (and harumph on them, cuz I know you're all gonna kick ass and chew bubblegum by the time I'm done with yas!).  Anyway, that's it for my bit of inspiring leadership. I'll be your host and DM and hopefully provide you with a painless introduction to the beautiful world of High Fantasy role-playing that is D&D.
