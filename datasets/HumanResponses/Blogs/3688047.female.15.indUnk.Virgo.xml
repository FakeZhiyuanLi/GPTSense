      Guess wut? CCGH has invited me to visit their school... It will be interesting... I think I have made my decision on which school to go to in Sixth Form if I achieved at least 5As or more... I've been thinking recently... What have I got to lose? Thinking about it... the people I hang around with in Anglo never really accepted me... there's no point staying... Cuz, the people I really wanna be friends with ignores me... except for luvly Laura!  Have you ever want to be friends with someone so badly? Well, I have... I've got a feeling that she thinks that I'm gay... but, the truth is... I'm not! Gay people are strange!

      This world is so strange... The people you spend all your effort to help are the people who will make your life a misery. In the sense that they ignore you when they kne you can no longer help them. But, the people whu are actually there for you, you never realise until you are goin to lose them. There's this gurl at school whu I helped from the beginning of year 10. In the beginning, she made me so paranoid about the people around me by telling me everything about what people say about me... I mean, it really made me lose my confidence and i became really weak. Then, one day she came to me and said she dun need me to be her friend because of the conflict between me and a friend. And now, I could have ignored her since I realized I can survive without her. I have had more friend than I have before. I had more friends when we stopped being friends. And now, she wanna be my friend for that. How can I ignore her? I can't do these kindof stuffs... I'm not the kindof person whu ignores people. I just can't do it! So, I thought to myself, what will I feel if some1 ignore me? I wouldn't like it would I? Then, the thing came out in my head n I decide to treat people how I want to be treated, no matter how bad the person treat me... I just wanna be a good person!

      Today is jst like everyday! My life is jst so lame after I've moved to England. All my social life jst disapear. I jst don't know whu to trust... it's so different compare to my life in Miri. All I do in Miri is hanging out wiv my buddies from different schools. I luved being luved. I luv being trusted by my friends. I luv knowing so many people.I luved my life in junior school (Chunghua Krokop) n my like in high school (St. Co). But in England, I jst dun feel like i belonged. I guess its cuz i was accepted by my friends in high school in Miri, n I literally knew at least 10 people from each year, particullarly the Senior pepz n pepz from my year group! Everyday, I ponder to myself...why don't I get on with everyone like I did before. I guess its b'cuz i join the schools so late that everyone have their own 'group' of friends th8 they dun feel like to welcome new comers... I really can't figure out why...Can some1 plz tell me?
