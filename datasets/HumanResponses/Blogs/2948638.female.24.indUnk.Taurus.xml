						       urlLink The Official Peanuts Site    I was just browsing when I found this strip and started to think. Lack of time is an evil we all have to cope with. However, we can use all the time we are doing other things to reflect on our actions as teachers. Peanuts is one of my favourite cartoons and what I find extremely interesting about it is the fact that each character has its unique personality traits. Reading what Lucy answered Charlie Brown made me realize how we teachers sometimes behave like her. We are always studying and talking about how important it is to understand and respect the differences in our classrooms, that students have different learning strategies that and their learning process is not always the same. However, we get a little (and sometimes a lot) frustated when students don’t follow our paths, when they try to do things in a different way, when they don’t agree with us. It’s also true concerning our relationship with some of our colleagues. Who among us can honestly say that has never felt upset when another teacher said our ideas were not good? Accepting the different is an endless exercise and admiting our weakness is its first move.

						    Setting Personal Objectives    1. Give a brief description of a successful learning experience you've had recently.   The one I think would be nice to mention is my experience as a student of CPE course last year. It was very interesting to be in the position of the student again and feel some things I thought I'd forgotten. Sometimes although the student likes the classes and admires the work of his teacher, he doesn't feel like talking about certain topics. Maybe because he's tired or just because the topic isn't familiar to him. Reflecting upon this has changed my mind in terms of my expectations towards some "silent students".    2. What motivated you to go throught with it?  The possibility of improving myself as a teacher as well as a person.   3. What are your expectations concerning the Early Inset?  The ones already mentioned above and the idea of getting more familiarized with the staff.   4. What difficulties do you anticipate?  I'm quite sure I'll find really difficult to speak during the face-to-face sessions.

						   In fact I've carried out an activity which envolved both vocabulary and grammar. When my Junior C groups (I had two of them this term) were learning vocabulary related to shops and the structures to ask for and give directions, I decided to build a big map of a city with them. I designed the roads, trees, cars and buses and the students were supposed to draw and stick their own shops on the map.  At the end, instead of using the map from the book, they asked for and gave directions using the map they've built themselves.It was fun, the kids loved it and I felt them more motivated to practice target language. It's the second term I carry out this activity and it's been working well.

						   I'm afraid I'm going to sound redundant, since most of the teachers mentioned Interlink and that is the series I'd like to write about.  Colin has asked:     "In your opinions, do the books you chose to write about deal satisfactorily with the phonological aspects of vocabulary? (ie how words are pronounced, word stress, words that will cause pronunciation problems for Brazilian speakers etc). "     Well, I've worked with all Interlink books so far and I'm very happy with the way it deals with vocabulary in all its aspects. The different colours used to help students work on vocabulary, the specific exercises to drill it, the tips concerning the most commonmistakes for Brazilian speakers, the related pictures...  I've just arrived from an Interlink 2 class. We've covered lesson C7 tonight and all those things helped a lot to grasp all the vocabulary related to food, as well as the idea of countable and uncountable nouns.
