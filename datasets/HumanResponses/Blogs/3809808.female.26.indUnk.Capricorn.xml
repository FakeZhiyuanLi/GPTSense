      I am again reminded just how uninteresting a place Orlando is, and just how unhappy I am here. We recently traveled to Boone, NC. "Boone?!?" you say, "backwoods hell, I'm sure" you say. That's what I expected too. But they had a lovely healthfood store called Earthfare which was as big as Whole Foods, had all organic produce, a huge personal care department, quite a buffet spread- even for breakfast! I could have moved in. Also, there was a tasty little vegetarian restaurant, really quaint, replete with the 60's hippie throwback for a waitress. I promise you I have never heard such a pot- inspired- accent- bespeaking-ones- careless- abandon- and- appreciation -for- life ANYWHERE but on tv. The burritos were really tasty too, they had a gouda cheese plate, and were definately kid-friendly with a basket of toys on the floor to investigate. While perusing the bulletin board, I noticed numerous advertisements for midwives and doulas, which was really cool, me being the birth junkie I am. Again, not something you see much of in Orlando despite our size. Well outfitted pagan store- LOTS of interesting stuff on the pin-up board over there.... Avalon in Orlando is DULL in comparison. Hell, it's dull NOT in comparison. And of course, all this close to the mountains so you can be in the middle of nowhere in a matter ofminutes. I didn't check out any coffee shops, though I am sure there were some good ones.  On that note, this morning I went to our local independent coffeehouse entitled "stardust" . It is, predictably, the hangout of various self-titled misfits and rebels and we- love- little-known-bands- and- we- are- so- tired- see- our- black- hair- and- striped -stockings-sorts. So, while I normally find this crowd entertaining, this morning I was made painfully aware of how laughable they were in the context of our not-so-fair city. See, any place else I've been, the coffeehouse is almost kind of neutral ground. You have your goth types, but also executives, and crunchy folk, and yuppies, and basically anyone who likes coffee. But here, the air was thick with a "you don't belong vibe" the distaste for my being there with my 2 kids was palpable. I sat in the corner nursing my three month old and stared at people coming in the door looking shocked to see me there. So much for supporting small business. I mean YIKES! Am I only welcome if I leave my kids at home and make sure I'm wearing my smiths t-shirts and look really dejected to be alive? God forbid anyone should think for themselves AND want a cup of coffee.......can you tell this bothered me?

      I have burned a pot. My most regularly used size. And while the set I have is not my  urlLink dream set  I do like it, spent a good amount of money on it, and am not willing to ditch a piece of it. Having to replace it with a pot that didn't match the set would annoy me greatly. Unfortunately, I didn't burn it with food in it. That doesn't seem to be too much trouble to rectify. I instead scorched the pot while steaming, letting the water dry up, so it was empty and sitting over the heat for god-only-knows-how-long. (The troublesome vegetable dumplings were mighty tasty though!) I don't know how to fix it. I tried vinegar. It did seem to bring up some black residue but it's still not back to its ole' shiny self. I know  urlLink restoration hardware  once sold some stainless steel cleanser but they've closed the store closest to me.  In other news, we headed out to disney on the evening of the fourth for some fireworks, ended up  urlLink eating  Had Fantastic grouper cheeks over a sweet-pea pruree, some flatbreads, a mediterranean sampler, and a rare ahi with onion/shallot risotto. Risotto was good upon first tasting, but when I came back to it later, maybe a tad too sweet. Have another evening out planned for the fifteenth(our 8th anniversary) We went to  urlLink V&amp;A's  last year. They have a chef's table option but we decided to eat in the dining room. It was there that I first became aquainted with vaccuum coffee pots. Very cool. Anyway I think we're heading someplace different this year. We need to decide and make reservations.

      The car-buying experience is not going smoothly.  Apparently some people don't want you to actually BUY the vehicle they are selling, they just want to taunt you with photos and refuse to answer emails or provide the payment address.  I would really like to drive a  range rover.  I am ignoring my tree-hugging sensiblities and pretending that its flagrant nose-thumbing at fuel economy doesn't concern me.  I was leaning toward a toyota landcruiser for awhile.  I really liked the third row seats. You can cart 8 people around in that thing.  I don't know where we're going, but I like the idea.  While the range rover doesn't have that, it does have other cool features that betray my secret desire to join the yuppie club.

      I am on a quest to make the perfect biscotti.  Unfortunately, I have a newborn which doesn't make much time for biscotti recipe experimentation.  It does, however, make a perfect opportunity for biscotti research.  Now I just need to discover a no-fail way to get rid of 30 or so lbs of "evidence"  Is  urlLink anise  the same thing as fennel seed?  They both taste like licorice, which makes it all the more confusing.  Add into the mix the fact that my oven is not holding a consistent temperature and the thermometer I bought doesn't seem to care one way or the other how hot it is in there, and the results are not that appetizing.  I had one batch that came out more like those stella something or other "italian biscuits" you buy on your neighborhood cookie aisle.  Not a  urlLink good grocery store  either.  A little more spongy and not quite light enough.  Then I had a batch that was pretty much burnt.  It didn't matter how long you soaked those suckers in  urlLink coffee , they were not softening up.  And WHY won't the local  urlLink culinary college  just SEND me the information I want instead of insisting on speaking to me on the phone?  I have no earthly idea.  Don't they understand I have a phone phobia?  I'm more than happy to give you my money people, just send me the information packet so I can apply!
