      This past week has been so tiring and confusing.... basketball camp is just tiring i mean really tiring.... weird how you dont do that much but you just get tired.... tommorows the last day Thank God.... Im hoping for an award i got complimented by a lot of coaches today.... i had to play like a wing which is a new thing but are coahc was really confusing so i just like played all positions.... and i got to the hoop tons.... the reserve coach told me to keep doing what i was doing which made me happy but i was tired the last game so i didnt play that well we came in a nice second.... oh well... im trying this for no reason... my sis has been on it forever her and a whole bunch of her friends from dv8 which i think is kinda like a cult thats why i dotn go to it.... but its over and im hoping it wont get started up again b/c i really dont like what its done to my sis shes really judgemenatl but i cant do to much about it... for some odd reason ive been worrying about stuff that ive never worried about before... Grades for freshmen year i guess im just kind worried that im actually going to have to try next year and now im trying to decide whether ot play football people are pressuring me and im just like im thinking about it..... wow im mad omeka okepher got sent to the bobcats..... feel bad for him.... sry NBa draft is what im watching.... Coop should be getting back here soon i really miss that guy its kinda boring around here with out him and i going to down to the pool and messing with the hot life gaurd Jessica or just clowning with mike whos tight....Found a new group i think but i think coop introduced them to me the story of the year or something kinda like new found glory but i kinda like them better.. im going to grab two c.d.s tommrow trapt and the story of the year one each has like only one bad song on each which is awesome.... im feeling kinda sick today so im not going to parks and rec i hope they dont miss me....haha caleb elias is a clwon though hes actually starting ot like a girl he says not just date them for you know what... lol Caleb im gonna miss that kid next year.... im gonna try a new thing called not hating canterbury people.... i mean i hate them but im gonna do some soel searchign or whatever its called lol and i just apologized to derek which is a weird thing... never thought i would be doing that now he'll probaly start cussing me out any seocnd which i dont care that kid has nothing to back it up..... except his money.... okay well im out for now got to go think about tons of stuff have some new stuff going through my mind.....i think suzy is sick or something but i really didnt talk to her last night i left and we usually talk later on at night but she just went to bed which is what i did b/c i was totally dead

Josh is just an awesome guy... lol even though we barely know eachother... oh yea for the fourth i went to the wizards game with will and watched the pretty fireworks.... they were pretty good just a lil bit to long my neck got really sore from looking up..... im going to wake up tommrow and go to the swim practice and bug people there even though im not swimming anymore i need to talk to a couple people there..... and then at 1 i have drivers training which really sucks its so boring.... i need to get that homework done.... im going to be driving soon :-P haha thats really scary hey but im a pretty good driver.... i really want to see my girl suz ive not talked to her or seen her in a while..... its always good to see your g/f lol or atleast talk to her... i guess shes staying at her g-pas or something b/c hes sick dont ask me... but shes not called me or anything so im not going to worry about it but she keeps on coming into my mind which scares me lol.... im really scaring myself lately :-P my grandparents came over for dinner tonight... and stuff that was interesting i love my grandpa... he always says hes pissed off at me b/c im taller then him which always cracks me up... but its still bothering me that he said if we ever put him in a nursing home... hes just gonna like kill himself... i feel bad for him he hates being old and he like always tell me to enjoy my life... i think he means i shouldnt get married lol..... i dont think im gonna get married.... just to much hastle.... but then again love is awesome(sometimes) lol im really sounding like a girl lately and im really scaring myself maybe b/c its one o clock in the morning and im really tired..... but i really dont feel like going to bed b/c ive not been getting any sleep b/c of all the shit on my mind.. i hate that feeling but ive learned to live with it im gonna have to put my retainer in soon.... ive been ignoring it a lot i really dont like wearing it but i always wear it at night so i might be good.... if i get braces again im going to kill someone....ok well i think i made this really long and stuff... so im done.... have a good night and please like pray for me b/c i need some major help :-D
