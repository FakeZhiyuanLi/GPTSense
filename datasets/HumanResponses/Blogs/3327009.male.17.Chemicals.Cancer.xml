      So today was great. Like splendid awesome radical great day. To start things off, after school I went body boarding with Thomas and Tyler. On the way over I'm just listening to Jack Johnson with the window down (weather wasn't that great though). I was just tranquil and calm. It was great  I get to the beach and watch the surfers for bit before getting out of my truck. I get out Thomas and Tyler come running up (they were the only people in the whole beach to be in the water without a wetsuit).  I give Thomas a wetsuit, Tyler didn't want one, and I put mine on. Waves were pretty small but they way fun nonetheless. Thomas and Tyler leave, I stay. Catch a few more waves before I start thinking about sharks and seeing dark objects below me. I also saw a guy that I thought was my dad. That really tripped me out. So, I stared at him for a prolonged period of time, poor guy.  After this I was driving home, feeling on top of the world. Once again listening to Jack Johnson, coming home from the beach, no shoes, window down, foot heater on. Oh it was jolly. I called Monica, then went over to her house. Christian and Corie were there too and we had a splendid time together. Stuff happened, we did stuff, then I came home.  I took a long, hot shower, put on some sweats, it was great. I felt the day was filled with good stuff. And now I'm on the computer...but I had to write about this day. The Day of Good Feelings.  Current Ferret: My P.E. sweats.  George Bush is the worst president ever. I disagree with him on almost everything. Bill Clinton knew what he was doing. I mean George Bush doesn't care about our safety or anything about this country. He believes in himself and that's it, NOT the American people.

      So after years and years of waiting, I finally got Adobe Photoshop 7. Ashley said she'd come over and help me learn how to use it.  So she text messages me asking when to come over, so I say "whenever you want." I'm expecting her to come over around 4 maybe 5 o'clock (this is Monday so lots of people come over around 7). So I'm sitting around waiting, confusing myself with this program which is more of a mathematical engineering project lab than a photo-editing program, when 4 rolls past, then 5, then 6...Finally Jon comes over at 7.  Then Ashley walks in a few minutes after  "Way to come early to help me out here!" thinks Mike. So I say "hey, Ashley."  Then she sits herself at my computer and rather shows me that she knows how to use this program better than me and how great she is. She started out explaining some features, but then she just got into this zone where she just mumbled to herself--acting like she's showing me how to use this--showing off what she knows how to do. So I learned absolutely nothing.  Now I tried out some of the stuff she did yesterday, but I don't know what the hell any of this is. So I quit trying to use it and looked at paintball stuff.  Current Ice Cream Bar: Snarley's  Sam Figueroa--if you know this guy, don't try to get to know him. He's a loser. He's really weak and scrawney, he can't swim and he sucks at water polo. He never wears sweats either. He sucks at surfing. He is not my favorite freshman. If I were another person I would NOT want to be him.  Note: If you haven't read my earlier posts, I'll inform you of a secret. When I talk about people in the end of my posts, everything is the opposite. It's all sarcastic and opposite. So, it's kinda like you're deciphering a code.

      Ok that idea went bad. I suck at making up rap/poetry. I couldn't even make one verse/stanza. Now I'm obligated to make a post.  I got shot today. No, I didn't. hahaha funny funny everyone laughs.  This sucks. I don't want to make a post.  You're having fun. No, you're not.  Give me $1000 and I'll show you how to spend it real quick like.  This is poetry.  This is love.  These are my thoughts and feelings.  I am a poet.  No, I'm not!  I'm done with this. I've wasted my time and your time.  Current Space Bar Key: Duramir in the scene where he's trying to light Faramir on fire, but then he gets caught on fire then runs about 100 yards and jumps off a cliff at Minias Tirith (I think that was the place)  Omar Alvero is...I have to save that for another post. He's too awesome to write about right now.

      Now these are the worst thing in the world in my opinion. I think it's kinda one of my pet peeves. I cannot stand hypocritical people. I probably am hypocritical sometimes, so if I ever am, tell me so I can fix it. Cause a hypocrite is the last thing I want to be.  I mean, if someone says something then doesn't follow through, or does the opposite of what they say, that pisses me off. People need to learn how to live and do what they say.  Ejemplos:  Never mind. I won't give examples because some people might think I'm pointing them out and telling them that they're a bad person, even though I wouldn't be (if you know what I mean). So instead of examples, I'm going to give you advice.  If you are a hypocrite in any way shape or form (even in the littlest of ways), quit right now. I strongly dislike hypocrites and people of the sort, like gypsys.  Current Keyboard: acer  Sean Iliff is not a good guy. He's a sucky swimmer and he hates me. He's not funny and he probably doesn't surf. He watches teletubbies and eats kerosene. Fortunesque.

      First off I'd just like to say sorry.  I apologize for not updating my protectorate as much as you'd like. I know you all want more and more of me, but I'm busy. So back off this before I ho-slap you, bizzle. I mean, sorry for not posting more. You want to hear what my life is like and you just can't tell what it's like when I don't post. Which shows you that my life is so awesome and incredible that I'm too busy to write in my own _ _ _ _.  Secondly, what's in my life right now? Ping-pong. This is what life is about. Ping pong is life. I mean, John Hansen knows what I'm talking about. This needs to be the nucleus of every young man's life. Death, taxes, and ping pong (and Tyler Smith, but that's another story).  I love this game more than I love my body (which is a whole hell of a lot).   Thomas Ryan set up his ping pong table and it's incredible. I got my paddle, hooked him up with some nice balls and fun doesn't stop till that young chello chimes hence. And we haven't even started playing Samurai Ping-Pong which is the epitomy of hardcore men. People who play Samurai Ping-Pong deserve to be called Axel or Sven...maybe even Raven Bloodworth. Yeah I'm done writing...almost...  Current Event:   Omar Current Journal: Omar Current Flow:    Omar  John Hansen has shorter hair than Brad. He isn't funny at all, he's a terrible score keeper, and he sucks at ping pong. He's terrible and he doesn't deserve to play. I hang out with him way too much and I get annoyed when I'm around him. He needs to get a new car and life.

      So in my life right now, I want to buy a new paintball gun.  It's a ICD B2K 2004 with a bunch of other goodies which comes out to $750. I don't have $750. I have somewhere around 400; this is a good number, but I wish it were higher. Anywho, in an attempt to create a larger number of surplus, I went to gain a higher income.   Tarpy's: sounds great. Awesome tips, fun people, I know people who might be able to get me a job. But no. I get my application, hostess was way nice, things are going good. I go to turn in my application, some lady takes it then walks off (bad, I don't get to talk to anyone).  A different hostess than the first one tells me she has to go to a meeting, but she'll definitely call me (suuure.....). So that kinda sucks. Then there's something inside of me saying, "she might call!" but no, she won't. And that something inside me will get crushed like a bug on Oprah Winfrey's chair.  So now all I can do is look at this gun and think about how good it will be...when i get it in 45 years.  Current depression state: plaster  Zach McDaniel is one of the most boring people ever. He's not a freshman and if he was he's not in my top 3 freshmen. He can't make jokes and I never laugh when I'm around him. He doesn't swim and he's not into hardcore music like a person. His name might be Wilford Denzel.

      So I'm sitting here, looking at new paintball guns and whatnot, cause I love paintball. Then I remember that I'm not really good at paintball, or anything else for that matter. I played sports, sucked at all of them. I played computer games, sucked at all of them. Played paintball, sucked at that. Played the game of life (not the board game, the real game), and I sucked at that. Tried playing musical instruments I sucked at that. So by now I think you should get the picture (figure of speech, not an actual picture).  Moral of the story is: I suck at everything.    But this doesn't bother me. Actually it does. But that would sound bad if I said, "and that bothers me." So I realize that I still have yet to find something that I'm good at, if that's anything. Maybe I'm good at ping-pong...no I suck at that.  In Junior High I was OK at fooseball, but I don't like fooseball anymore. (This is the time for all the girls out there to start feeling bad for me)   Monica is so annoying. She's so hard to talk to and no one likes her. Every boy runs away from her in disgust. No one can stand being around her. She never gets embarrassed about anything. I'm also not engaged to her and we're not getting married.

      So, I starting this protectorate in spite of my friends who were making an attempt to become cooler than me. They got really close. They started these protectorates and they were having fun, and making jokes, and being funny...but I wasn't. So I started this thing in an attempt to be cool like them.  Boy, was I clueless about what I was getting into.  So I've posted like 3 times (this'll make #42) and I find it tough to keep up. Everyone wants more. "We want more," they say. So what happens next you ask? I give them more. I can't keep up with the raging demands for more entries. Which brings me to my next point: Starting a protectorate is like a girlfriend...it takes commitment.  Now I'm infringing on a delicate subject here, because I, Mike Schmiess, have a girlfiend. Now what I have to do is get my point across without creating any tension or hurt feelings by using this analogy. So here we go:  Point #1. You ask a girl to go out with you.......You sign up for a protectorate  Point #2 You spend time with your girlfriend.........You have to make time to write posts  Point #3 Sometimes you need to be committed to your girlfriend........You have to make a commitment to your protectorate  Point #4  A feeling of love must be mutual.........uh.............yes, my protectorate does love me back!  So by these 4 points, you can OBVIOUSLY see that protectorates are exactly like girlfriends.   Brad has a crew cut.  He likes to be inconspicuous and unseen.  He is the most serious person ever. He loves being quiet in public and whispering.  He drives a heck of nice pimp-mobile.  He sucks at computer games and he never reads.  Also he is really easy to understand.

      So today, school was pretty rockin'. I gotta see my friend's band play at school and it was way cool.  My sister was there too, which made my day even awesomer. After school I went to.......the beach with Monica, Ashley, Christian, Tyler, and Thomas Ryan.  The water was freezing and there was shrinkage going on down under like no other.  It hurt...there.  So we went to the Hyatt to swim, and Ashley and Monica never came like they said they would...liars.  It was still fun.  Day's going well, everything's fun exciting...I'm on my way, it's just an average day.  Then I head over to Bubba Gump's and order later than everyone else cause I got there late.  I felt isolated and away from everyone cause I sat kinda near the end and the place was way loud so I couldn't hear anyone talking.  But then my food came, oh yes. It was breaded shrimp which still tastes incredible when I burp. Heck yea! I go over to bible study which was kinda boring tonight, but hey, that's bible study, I guess. Then I hear some bad news, which makes me a bit emo, but I keep my cool, cause I'm hot like that.  Thomas is the most boring person ever. He's never funny and he can't tell jokes or stories. He has his drivers license and he loves school. He hates this one girl, and he is extremely lame and boring to hang out with. I never hang out with him because he's so greedy and unhospitable. He bases all his opinions of people (like me) on their looks, so I'm not his friend.  Song: Ashton - Rise of the Coloured Nations

      So after school on Wednesday, I go to the Bagel Corner with a friend.  I order a toasted bagel and a green tea. Before I ordered there was the fangly man infront of me in like. He was kinda like the alien from Men In Black.  He once turned around and looked at me, shook his head and made a grumbly grumbly sound. I smiled and nodded only after I shoved him to the ground and spit on his dog. I jumped on his flubbery belly and used it like a sling shot and sent me flying into a Billy Grahm look-alike.  He told me to wash my face, but I went to Target instead.    This is where nothing at all happens.  So I get to Target and nothing happens.  I spend over $423.91 and when I relize I'm now broke, I punched a girl named Bethany in the face and rode off on her bike.  Too bad she had a pocket police man...I got chased for 3-4 hours before the little bast*rd shot me.  He stole my loot, except for the undershirts I bought at Target and left with my pride.  So now I'm 26.7 miles from my house with no loot, no pride, and no morale.  My friend Thomas stole a car from some cholo from SEM and came to pick me up (Well, the part with Thomas didn't actually happen, but it makes a good plot twist). Now I begin to realize the irony going on this day because 1) Thomas is driving 2) Thomas was not the funniest guy ever 3) I was a blood-thristy villian with a dirty undershirt, a dirty face, facial hair, and incredible bulging muscles 4) I made a joke and everyone laughed at it 5) Tyler got a girlfriend.  Now, as you can see from those last 5 statements, none of those things would ever happen in a world.   This is what made the day so great. Irony.  If any of you read Thomas' protectorates, you'll know that he says stuff about people at the end, and I think that's way cool, so I want to do that.  But to be different, I will say the opposites about every person.  So to understand it, you have to reverse everything (i.g. "Thomas is a terrible story-teller" means "Thomas is a the best story-teller in the youth group").  So you have to translate it...  Tyler is complete normal. He does nothing out of the ordinary and he cannot make any laugh. He has normal, boring plastic cups at his house.  He's made of mold and fools gold.  20 times has he become a plastic.  Tyler hates loud music and he drives with his shirt on.

      So here's my protectorate (my new name for blogs). I thought long and hard about starting this protectorate because I thought when I started mine I would try too hard to be funny and cunning and it would be dumb, but then I started it and wow. This is fun! I mean, I'm just typing away and having a great time. I mean I'm just typie-typie-type. It's great. Then I think, no one will ever read this except for maybe 8 people ever, but that's cool I guess.  Right now I'm just starting my protectorate and testing the waters...more crazy, fantastic, blood-curdling, free-lancing posts to come...  I've seen people do this kind of thing before, so I'm going to do it too  Song: Sublime - Same in the End Mood: Heart-felt Program: Outlook-Express Postal Service: UPS Pavement: Asphalt Person: Ricky Henderson when he was on the A's

      So, I haven't been posting on here a lot. Mainly do to some things going on in my life right now. In other words, I'm busy. Busy doing what? Ok, I will tell you.  1) Warcraft 3 has become a large priority of mine 2) Final that I don't study for...ok that hasn't kept me busy 3) I'd rather be with people than on a stupid blog that's really pointless 4) Gaining popularity 5) Thinking about issues  So don't get mad at me if I don't update this thing. I'm sure I'll get around to it once in a while; like I'm doing right now. But my posts will not be everyday, every other day, or anything to a regular scheme. Sorry for the let down. I know it's a big one, but deal with it. Enjoy parchment.  Current state: Canada (it's number 51)

      I apologize for my abstinence in blogging in the past couple of days. I'm sorry for any problems this may have cause you or your family. I have so much stuff to write about that it's too much.  We'll go with the general stuff in my life.  I went down to Santa Barbara this weekend. It was awesome! That place is so freaking cool. I want to live there in 3.7 hours. I saw my brother (my ultimate role model) and realized how he has like the coolest life ever and I want to be him even more after seeing him. Tyler went with me on the trip down...good times, good times.  Uhmmm, paintball gun will be mine soon, I get to shoot it and check it out this Friday. Quite excited for me. Paintball is once again a big passion of mine again.  Uhmm, I think Ashley's really pissed at me right now. I won't go much more passed that or she'll get even more pissed at me. She's probably even more mad at me for just writing that. She's either reading this or has read this...ok I'll stop there.  (Stop as in stop for that subject area)  Today once again felt like summer. School's really easy and simple. Which reminds me I need to make a phone calls. Yes, a phone calls.  Ok, well that info should keep you happy until I see you.  Current pencil: Dixon Ticonderoga  Daniel Carrillo (little Jerry) is a short-haired girl. He's a penut and a frog. He's most definitely NOT a luscious.
