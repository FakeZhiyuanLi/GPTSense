      On your mark, get ready, set.... GOOOO!!!!!...  Oh how the streets on Montreal have become race tracks. Everyone....  ok maybe not everyone, but 90% of the people in Montreal do not know how to drive safely.&nbsp;Ok, people can say that&nbsp;the streets are not fit for good drivers....I mean with all the murder holes, or should I say pot-holes&nbsp;on the streets to ambush these war or assassins' vehicle&nbsp;that we call cars,&nbsp; are all there to serve as obstacles to "test" the driver's skills and verify that the driver is alert at all time...Oh how much I must say&nbsp;thanks to the government of Quebec for public funding to repair the streets...How they always repair that stupid same highway from years to years...(15 on the Decarie level, anyone?) but never repairs some of the streets. Then, to add more problems, well there's the number of lanes in the streets and highways...What's wrong with those engineers....2 lanes.....need I say more...What kind of big city have 2 freakin' lanes at highway interchanges...Turcot interchange(where the 20 meets the 720 and the 15), or how about those freakin' bridge like the Champlain bridge...With a population of about 3.3 Millions in the metropolitan area of Montreal, you would think that engineers would think about making the number of lanes more than freakin' 2 lanes....Ok, so this being said, traffic is really bad in Montreal   To make things worst, as if that wasn't enough..There's the people....YES the PEOPLE. Awww Montreal, where the city speed limit is only a suggestion. Now you would think that with all the&nbsp;despicable road conditions, people would actually be more careful or drive slower...Guess again, how stupid&nbsp;people can sometimes be, is truly amazing.&nbsp; People think that their racing against freakin' Micheal Schumacher...and I don't mean just the people driving regular cars...I mean everyone in Montreal!!! Even bus drivers...Oh don't get me started with them...Some of them&nbsp;have&nbsp;a donkey's behind&nbsp;attitude with the intelligence of a brain obtained from a box of Cracker Jack...Where do they get these bus driver...So to show you an example of the "excellent" service on the&nbsp;37 circuit,here is an example...And it happens quite frequently...Not just once and a while..I mean&nbsp;almost everyday frequent....   First, as I wait for the bus at the bus stop, well it can be sometimes really hot, really cold, rainy or snowy depending on&nbsp;the weather. So as I'm waiting,&nbsp;the buses from the 37 circuit is either too early, or too late...But when you come in a bit late..They never wait for you, and actually drives a lil slower so the driver&nbsp;can wave their hand and say Bye. Or if they want to be on time, they hurry to arrive early, and they let the bus at the stop so that the chauffeur can have his or her break...away from the bus...so, instead of letting the people in, they let the people stay outside in the bad weather and the chauffeur always go back in the warmth somewhere unknown where all decent or not chauffeur go during breaks. Ok, so after letting the people stay in the bad weather, they let everyone in and show how they have power and control the almighty bus by demonstrating their cantankerous behavior. But hey, it can be understandable..I mean you're driving all day, making about 60k a year, with lots of benefits, and overtime, and you get to be on strike for any reasons paralyzing the whole population using public transportation, oh and you have to deal with people sometimes...Life can be soo hard for them :P...anywhooo..as i wait there to ring the bell to stop just before my stop, i ring the bell...i look around in the bus to see how many people will get out....There's about 5-10 people in the bus but none except me that wants to get out, nothing the driver can't handle.....So as I wait to get out in front of the doors, the drivers starts to accelerate..Then I'm like err WTF,why drive so fast when the stop is only about 100 meters away. Well I start waving, and quickly saw that it was not very effective, so  ......Then as I give the WTF stare and watch the bus driver through the mirror, he doesn't mind me.....So as I walk up the alley to the main entrance of the bus and go to the driver and tell him  me: hey I don't mean to be rude, but you missed my stop...  Bus Driver: oh, did I?(pretending to care) oh I'm sooo sorry....well I just didn't see you nor the stop....  me: yeah it's ok (thinking yeah right Jack A**, you couldn't hear the bell, couldn't see the bus stop sign, and didn't bother looking in your mirror)  B. D.: oh well I guess I could let you out here..(meanwhile he's still driving)  me: yeah here would be nice...(if you really meant it, why didn't you stop before saying it)  ok so this is one of the many examples that reflect the attitude of the people driving in Montreal..FASTER is better....now, picture and imagine&nbsp;this, imagine a bigger scale of those kind of people, but all driving on the highway or on the streets....hogging the&nbsp;lanes as if the street belong to them. Cause most of them think that because they pay taxes, the street is rightfully theirs since it comes from THEIR money....So you see, people, drive fast..say on average 120 when the speed limit is 70, occasionally cut people cause there just soo many drivers..that people driving fast tend to driver even faster...cause it's not a race, but they don't want to be stuck behind in the so-called traffic, oh and did I mention that we had to dodge the pot-holes, now adding to this, you have the small number of lanes serving a big population of cars...which in the end gives you...a big nightmare...  &nbsp;BTW,&nbsp; it's not just bus drivers..even the "special" people from those "special Olympics" do that too...the other day I saw&nbsp;2 physically challenged..or should I say freaks&nbsp;in a wheel chair racing on the side street on those electric wheel chair... >.  i'm not saying that when i drive, i'm a safe and perfect driver...but geez..PEOPLE use your comon sense......we're bound to go down as a society....   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      well, 1st things 1st, i wonder if my page is going to be read...*hears in my head(BORING&nbsp;a la Homer Simpson)..ok ok...on with the real content  *music of The Wonder Years when Kevin Arnorld&nbsp;is thinking.  I wonder why&nbsp;life is&nbsp;soo complicated and yet in the same time soo simple. It seems that life cannot exist without an opposite and that everything is govern through the laws of irony.   People say that you stay healthy by going to the gym...well&nbsp; you know what, the gym can be a hazardous place to go to. Let me tell you about a lil' adventure/drama story that happened.   Once upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away,  ...as i go to the gym(YMCA), i pick up my lil MD player, put on some trance music to do some cardio. As i mount on top&nbsp;of the power 5000-elliptical machine and engage a hard training session - meaning i rise my heart level to 190 - just as a reference, kids under 12 have the highest heart rate functioning normally and it usually goes to 180. so going back to my story, as i stop suddenly, which is bad cause normally you have to "cool down" and i though,&nbsp; what the heck, i can take it...so i go drink some water... and since while you drink you can't breathe, well a lack of oxygen was created.  geez, the spasm i felt, ohh the pain...i felt like i was going to puke my insides out, as&nbsp;if my guts wanted to get out.&nbsp; Then i started to walk towards the window cause i see some mats and some seats. I figure sitting would be a good idea.&nbsp; so as i sit, i start seeing dark spots, and i start loosing my hearing...yes that's right...i'm starting to faint..so as i fall on the mat, feeling like Rocky Balboa in the 1st movie, "MIIIICKEYYY arrrrrhhhhhhhhhh!" i start yelling...well ok it was more like whining..but still i yelled for&nbsp;HELP!!! so i see all these people running around, doing their exercise and looking at me...and as i go down..not a single person came to&nbsp;see me....here is a dramatization of what happen, well just the dialogue part.   Me in a faint voice:&nbsp; &nbsp;HELP!!!!  Guy walking &nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp; oh look, he's recuperating from an exhaustive exercise.  Guy walking next to him:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ah yes, isn't the gym a great place to exercise, look at that guy resting and feeling in top shape. he looks like he's breething deeply and doing yoga.  Guy walking: i should start, it looks kind of fun  Me: Heeeelll....  suddently, i fall down and unconscious.  Me 15min later....  as i open my eyes, i look at my watch...oh look, i'm somewhere and i don't know what just happened except that i remember yelling for help....  so as you can see...what if i would be dying..would people just walk by and look at me and compliment me on my new form of Yoga...i mean..has the world gone insane and think that people trying to make weird faces are due to different exercises....  but that happened a couple of weeks ago...  not too long ago..*coughs yesterday  &nbsp;i was in the gym and as i go check the machines' reservation sheet, they were all taken. so i figure ok...maybe someone didn't go and i can go on it...so as i check, aha...one machine available..so i go, cross out the name that reserved it and put in my name..so it has been said from the YMCA that if you're late for your reserved machine, you lose your spot.  so as i exercise for my 1st 10minutes,&nbsp; a girl approaches me&nbsp;and says:   Girl: &nbsp;hey did you reserve that machine, cause i reserved it and you're on it...  giving a fearsome stare that shouts, if you say something i'll&nbsp;bite your heard off&nbsp;and spit you out in less than 5 seconds. and before i could say something....  Girl: someone crossed my name out and it wasn't me!  probably thinking, it was you you F***ing guy i should kill you on the spot.  Me: but you were late, so it was free and i took the machine...  the Girl&nbsp; was giving me this look..  me: you know what, there are plenty of machines available...gimme a second....  as i walk off to see the sheets,&nbsp; i see my name cross out, then i see her initials on 1 block only.....so she was late, crossed out my name from the 30minutes i reserved the machine and put her name for 10min, and as i look around, i see 2 machines that are free...  so instead of arguing and letting the world know about the biggest BI*CH on the world. i decided that i was a pacifist, so i just jot my name on the other machine.  me: you know what..whatever just take the machine....  so i just avoided a meaningless fight....and they call this place a YMCA...what does it stands for again... young man christian association !!! i don't think sooo...what's soo christian about that...PERSECUTION!!!!! can't a guy just work out PEACEFULLY!!!...   So you see,&nbsp; psychological violence is very present even in your YMCA....as for physical...geez....try reserving a machine during those peak hours...it's like frekin' bee hive...there are soo many people and they get medieval on your a** you you "steal" THEIR machine..and god knows how much i want to pick up a fight with a guy named Tiny or Bubba with 3 times my size..or should i say my torse is as big as his biceps... :S   then i realized how much of a twig i was...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Ottawa...the city where i have to be for 1 week for my work training...learning some programming with Lotus Notes...a 4th generation language....but that's not important..who cares...today is the 4th day and my last night in Ottawa. After many observations, i feel like Ottawa is Montreal's nemesis. Its arch-rival, its competitor. It would be Shelbyville if Montreal was Springfield. Well, you get the picture...if you add bureaucracy to Montreal..it's Ottawa.  First thing about Ottawa is that the size of the city is about the same size...well ok..maybe not at the same places..but fairly similar....it's like a giant Old Montreal with no Montreal downtown....okok..so there's a lot of old buildings, and there's only one mall. And, sure they have their own Marché Jean-Talon..or Marché Atwater...in Ottawa it's the market. They even have their Crescent or St-Laurent street...ok so it doesn't have any clubs...but they have some restaurants on Bank street and Elgin.  Second of all...even after walking on the streets..i feel like the people are in competition with the people in Montreal...As i came out of the Tim Horton...i saw a bum begging for money that strangely looked like the one's hanging in front of the Guy-Concordia Metro station, near Concordia University..and guess what..near TIM HORTON Dun tun tuh! *Dramatic Music.  Let's not forget that the people here are soo...how can i say it in a nice way....let's just say that their behavior are very bureaucratic. For one, i have the impression that everyone works for the government..oh wait..Everyone DOES work for the government in Ottawa...ok..maybe not everyone..but about 75% of the working force in Ottawa does...:S Every freakin' building has the government's logo on it. Oh and what reflects the best about the federal government is the people that work for them... For the last couple of days...every time i walked in the elevator...they seem to not be able to know on what floor they work on. Here is a re-enactment. As i enter the elevator to reach my floor for my courses, other people enter the elevator too. My course is given on the last floor of the building. Me thinking: ok..so we're 10 people in the elevator...ahh that means we'll have to stop on 9 floors before i can reach my floor. As i observe the floors...i noticed that there were 14 floors light that were lighted.. me thinking: Hey....what gives...we're only 10...how can we stop on 14 floors :S..*sigh... Everyday was like that :S.... How sad...*sigh.  Even their YMCA is bureaucratic :S... me: Hi, i'm from out of town, but i'm a member of another YMCA...can i enter this YMCA too? YMCA clerk: well, if you present some ID, fill in this form and then i have to check with the database to see if it matches...you may. me: really? but i only have my hotel pass on me YMCA clerk: well actually if you have that it's fine too... me: ohh ok...cool YMCA: yeah, i was just kidding... me: yeah *chuckle... ...me 1 hour later leaving to the hotel.... me: hi. YMCA: hi...so can i help you me: can i have my hotel pass YMCA: no...! you have to fill the form B41. me: huh!??? *looking clueless YMCA: i'm just pulling your leg...i mean..i was just kidding me: ohh..sorry i'm kind of tired..i had a long day. YMCA: oh..*laughs.....well so you'Re from Montreal? cheer up...have a sense of humor... me: yeah...see what happens when you travel alone in a bureaucratic city...i feel like laughing all the time of course.... ok..i didn't really say that last one but..i was thinking about it.  Ottawa is nice..i mean it's really like a different version of Montreal with it's multi-ethnic city...and they have very similar places that Montreal has...though in a smaller scale.... Oh and i wonder where all the young people are...there are no young people nor kids downtown :S...I feel like it's GhostTown after 6.....i could get mugged and no one would even know...not even me :S  At least the market is nice...i was able to eat my lil panini with this guy playing some accordion...i felt like i was in Paris or something...living my lil life...like in the movies...then going for some desert in a place called "Oh So good"....they have all these amazing cakes... Heck they even have a Casino not too far away..well it's in Gatineau/Hull...but it's really in the same area :P like going to Notre-Dame island....you just need to cross the bridge...Literally.  But one thing for sure that i miss in Montreal...are the people...it's like always buying generic brands...you know you're meeting all these people..they are similar to the one's in Montreal..they all speak french and english...but..somehow...it's not the same as when you live all your life in Montreal..it's soo...not like the original....But..the weirdest thing i saw here..was a Paki guy working in a Japanese Restaurant and almost speaking with the japanese accent... -.-;;; i know...scary!!!

      Did you ever see the commercial of the TD bank where there's an old woman walking with her "marchette" to her bank with the background music of batman playing. Slowly going there with a fast pace music; I love that commercial, it always makes laugh. It makes me wonder how do they get these kind of ideas and where do they originated from.  Well this week i saw the light of where some of the ideas might come from, the grocery store!!! *dramatic music(dun turn tuh!). As i'm doing my grocery shopping, i wander around like Alice in Wonderland, looking at all the veggies, trying to find all the ingredients for the dish i had planned to cook. Well i go there during the afternoon of a thursday and on friday. I figure, hey people won'T go there, it's frekin' the end of the week and in the middle of the day...no one's going to be there....*aggressive buzzing! WRONG!!!!  Of course as i swiftly drive my cart in the veggies' isle of loblaws, i see an old man, admiring the tomato, choosing and picking them one by one...so i carefully dodge him sweeping right beside him gracefully. But to my surprise, as i pass by him, he decides that he had enough tomato, so without looking in the dead angle, he cuts through. Luckily my driving experience has proven useful as i put the emergency brakes in...i just abruptly stopped walking. To my surprise and shock, minding his own business not caring for the surroundings, the old man did like some bird and flocked off. so, i figure..ok..it happens.  Then, i turn in the isle where the fruits reside. I take my time to pick a couple of fruits, looking around once and a while to see if i was blocking some people....So I start walking towards the bread section. The isles are about 2 and a quarter carts wide, so i take the right "lane" and doze off. Out of nowhere, i see this old woman, walking soooo slowly...i could have stood there and i would have been faster than her..so i figure i would do a lil "speeding" and make it on the left lane....to my utter surprise there was another woman "racing" with her....another slow cart driver...and she took the time to call her husband, then looking at some fruits while blocking the isle :S so as i excuse myself to pass, she starts to yell in a nosy and most obnoxious voice: Woman: Frank!!!! Do you want to peaches! Frank: I don't care, take whatever you want Me: Excuse me, may I pass? Woman: Frank, listen up!?! They look good, but i want to know if I should get some? Frank: Well sure Me: Excu.... Woman interrupting: But it's 0.10$ more per pound...are you sure... Me waving like i'm doing some flag signals to another boat: excuse me Woman: ohh sorry dear, i didn't see you... Walking passed her, i was thinking, what is it with people at the grocery store, they become automatically deaf or is it that their IQ returns to the stone age...They think that it's time to hunt for food, so they they forget their civilized matter and let the food environment take over. I can picture it right now... Some woman: Shhhushhh..i'm picking some apple.... husband: hurry up, i wanna go see the hockey Ga.... Some woman: Shhhh!!!! you'll scare the apples away! shouldn't you be hunting for meat at the butcher's section. Husband: you're right...ahhhh FRESH MEAT!!!! 'VVV' *manly grunt (in case you didn't know 'VVV' is a monster with small eye and big teeth) anyhow, it's like people do it on purpose to block you the way, and get the food before you....and they also start "picking" the veggies individually too...meaning.. ohh let's squeeze and palpate the fruits to see if they are fresh or not...leaving behind the already fresh fruit with some of their marks; as if to mark their territory.  But after finishing in the fruits and veggies section, i went off for the bread and milk section....oh my, it's worst than the old folk's house near my house....there were soo many people from the golden age. In that section, there's also the "buy what's dry in bulk and weight yourself what you buy" section. It's like they don't know what to do there and they're looking at everything as if there's nothing else in the grocery store, clogging up the isles :S Old man: should i get some prune...i like prunes, dried prunes.... other old man: come on, hurry up, i want my dried prunes too! another other old man: can i come too? old woman: hi, i'm going to bake some cookies for my grandson, ...blablabla..until someone falls asleep.  So as i ferociously swoop through the dangerous isle and dodging all the carts and unidentifed and wandering kids following their parents without looking, I fall in the meat and the rest section....It's interesting how people take their time at choosing what to buy. I clearly see what are in men or women's head when is ee them grocery shopping for cans... -Should i take President's Choice Chicken and noodle soup, or campbell? -I know, let's take the cart, leave it in the middle of the isle, maybe it'll make us think clearly on which brand to take...we can then calculate the optimum price/quality -ok let's go about 5-10 feet away from the cart and pretend we're looking...ohh look someone is approaching from afar... -mehh it's ok...he'll just go away if we ignore him.... As I approach..i see the woman noticing me, then quickly looking at her cans the way Indiana Jones does when he tries to substitute a bag of sand with the hard seeked treasure that the can is....Did I forget to mention that Loblaws always put the price ratio per gram on each price label so to make it easier to compare....Again, I was upset.  Then I went to ask for some grennadine to make some drinks....But i couldn't find it..so I asked a clerk...the service at Loblaws is quite excellent, almost to say that they'll take you by the hand to what you are looking for..So the woman start going through 3 different isles, then asks another clerk, and another...calls on the phone for the "guy" who's supposedly taking care of that section...so i figure yeah it's quite possible...after 15 minutes..we actually find the grennadine and I put the bottle where the seat for the baby is on the cart. She then goes to me: Clerk: You know, i knew where it was, i just wasn't sure of which isle it was at...oh and by the way, if you want a trick for next time, put the bottle inside the cart...cause most people always drop the bottle through the opening for the baby's leg... me: Yeah...i'll do that next time... It's funny how some people try to offer you help you when all you want is to go away. I was finally able to pay and go home after that... You know, i'm pretty sure that the people that owns grocery shops or those "marketing researcher" know about this, but it's all a big mastermind scheme to make you spend more time in store...if they could..they would probably put some barricade and tell you they'Re renovating. I'm sure they scrutinizingly observe people's behavior and do like comedians...only to make you spend more time, hence give them more chance of you buying something in store.

      This morning as i'm finishing my last overnight work shift..finally my last "vampire" feeling as i move up the corporate ladder....a co-worker of mine used to say that the company i work for is like a giant Cruise ship sailing..i replied to that, that since I was newly graduate, ready to be exploited, I was also like a little kayak and that i was following it. anywhoo, i'm diverting from the actual subject of what i wanted to write.  I couldn't help myself for i was completely scandalized.  The point is,  as i'm finishing, and reading the morning news as i usually do...i have the impression that we are being invaded by this american pop culture. More and more, our southern neighboor are taking over...or maybe is it that we're slowly being assimilated...and accepting it. It all started decades ago when this guy named Buck saw his fellow american named Red do some farming...well guess what, it didn't evolved much during the times into copying the culture..and i don't mean farming....sure american culture is funny...mostly due to their incompetency, lack of morality, under average(i'm being generous here) knowledge of an existing world outside of the US of A, and IQ demonstration of advanced kindergardenarism. It wasn't as bad in the previous years, but i think the actual turn out point was when Canadian society started to adopt and copy reality TV shows....oh geez, i feel my stupidity meter going off the charts!!! It wasn't that bad before because most of the shows that were copied, didn't really work well here up north. Not as popular, it would eventually die out the following year..especially the shows in french..(sigh)....but now after who wants to be a Millionaire, Canadian Idol(ok i know, this one comes from Great britain, but americans did make it more popular), the price is right, familky feud, etc..., here comes the horrific and french version of "The Simple Life"(Starring Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton)....dun tun Tuh!!!*dramatic music  Yes, starring two girls named Anne-Marie Losique and Jacinthe, the first one being a brunnette is actually a variety show host, she would be the Mary Hart or Nancy O'dell figure of french TV. The second being a pop singer. Both of them, of course being good looking, will be put to similar situations to the american show....but why oh god do they have to copy a show like The Simple life....Out of all the shows, they have to pay the rights to american companies for this concept...that my 11 year old sister could have come up with. We're already bombarded by stupidity...i mean why!!!!  Oh god, smite me upon your judgement and spare me the pain of zapping into this show accidentally...As Mr. Burns once said in a dramatized testimony(recall the show where Mr. Burns hits Bart while driving and is telling how he ended up hitting Bart)Take me!!! i'm old!!!...  I mean, why not have more shows that are smart..surely americans do have the Discovery channel with very interesting topics...like the one where they show how and when they uncovered King Tuht's sarcophagus.  Oh and i'm guessing that's just the begining...eventually we'll all end up talking like rednecks, we won't know any international news...our definition of international will become Canada and US...ok maybe Mexico, France and Great Brittain...I can picture it right now....as i watch the news and zap around, News on Tv(NOT): Tonight, an internaitonal crisis hits our country. me: how can it be international, if it's concerning our country...meh maybe it's actually affecting the world... NOT: The prime minister's dog attacked a baby! The baby was from a visible minority's background... NOT in a really low and diff. and fast paced voice like the one from the diclosures from adds on toys that we see on TV: of course the visible minority was actually native indians,  and the baby actually sustained no injury what so ever, was was psychologically attacked by the barking of the dog. NOT: Will it affect foreign policy...no one really knows...  has the world gone so lowly insane!!! i mean what are those corporate fat cats thinking...importing those kind of shows!!!! Has the demise of making money over the population gone so low, under the detriment of real culture. Oh but maybe it's a corporation conspiracy!!! oh don't even get me started on big corporations...anyone seen the movie "The corporation"....i strongly recommend it...now i'm working in a big corporation and have to be pro corporations.....but this is becoming ridiculously outrageous....

      Walking down the street, I was wondering where I was going in life. I feel like I'm in one of those T.V. shows about a people in search of their identity. Ok, I know it sounds clicheé, but hey I can't help it...this is what happens when you pass your entire childhood in front of TV; eventually you're bound the become like them...yes THEM...you know those characters in those generic shows that only change names from time to time, but in reality they're all the same...we know them as the people in Friends, Felicity, Ally McBeal, Sex In the City, The wonder years, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, etc.... Have you ever wondered what your life would be if you could shape it the way you wanted it to be. Well, I for one know what I have to expect in life. Absolutely nothing. I do know that I want to have enough money to be comfortable to not worry about it..oh and if you say money isn't important, yeah like you wouldn't want that :P, Then there's the job issue...well, before you used to hear, what you have to do because it's your job...these days, you hear, do what you like, not what you should do...well the way I see it...it has to be both...I mean if you're having too much fun at work...then you'll always want to be at work..doesn't the word workoholic comes in mind anyone? So it has to be fun, yes...but not too much, let's have a little of both.  Of course with all the thinking I was doing, I was not looking where I was walking....well like in many TV shows, I seem to have ram into a pole...again...Believe it or not yes it does happen in real life... At that moment I seem to recall all the moments that I have ram into something..you know like those flashbacks you see in TV shows..like the one where you see Homer Simpsons yelling 32 times Doh! and seeing them all in sequences. In my case, I recall ramming when I was a kid and even know into electrical poles, light poles, people, dogs, walls, doors, patio doors, cars, bicycles, stop signs, stop poles, steps(the one for aerobics training), glass wall, parking meter.... but I don't know how that happens..it seems to always happen in unnatural ways yet coincidental...like the sun blinding me while I walk and someone walking in front of me, then all of sudden the person would step aside to dodge a pole, and of course since I'm blinded by the sun, I wouldn't see it so I would ram into it....these kind of things.. :S you know it's not fun to ram into poles, and it may sound funny...but it's all fun till someone gets an eye popped...ok that sounded kind of exaggerated..but I did get cuts before on the forehead :P and people seem to be very amused by the notion of other people ramming into poles...what's up with that.... I see it in their eyes; I can picture it right now, if I were to fall in a conversation with them... Little girl walking: Look, there's an adult that just rammed into the stop sign Mom: oh he's just playing around with his friend and pretending little girl: no look, he's alone and he's bleeding.. mom: oh wait..*almost laughs hysterically little girl: wow, I hope he does it again! mom: yeah me too....what a funny guy... me: owe!!!..Hey look, I'm bleeding profusely. some one call 911...(ok...I wouldn't say that) but i'd say, ow that hurts.... mom: are you ok? me: well I think so... mom: oh ok, just don't ram into poles like that oh yeah like I do that purposely..what's wrong with you... me: yeah..i'll try *chuckles. mom: oh you're quite a character! *laughs me:....yeah....sarcastic look she's probably thinking..what's with this guy, he is either blind as a mole, or he's as dumb as I sound...(ok she may not have thought about that last one...but i'd like to think she did)  anyhow....as I came back home, I sat there cleaning my house, and wondering if I was the only person ramming into things without wanting to... We all know it happens on TV, but have you ever had you were in a TV show...or like in those super commercial that sells those "just like in TV...." products.  Maybe I'm just too nostalgic about the 80s and its TV shows. either that or I'm too deep in my thoughts hence loosing all consciousness of reality and consequently ramming into things. oh and kids, , don't try this at home...i'm a professional.

      Have you ever seen the movie Anger Management, well...let's just say, i think that we live in a very angry society. Regardless of the diminishing global barbaric and violent behaviour in the world, people in society have never been angrier in history. Of course this results in indirect or direct acts of violence, but i prefer to see the world as a violent pacifist, rather than seeing a world of violent pacifist. The reason is simple, usually the violence of a pacifist will never be as equal nor greater than  the peace of a violent person...besides the latter one is just a ticking bomb waiting to be awaken. This being said, let me tell you a little story.  During the last week, i have been allocated a lot of free time from my new position at work. Hence, giving me the opportunity, to travel a bit. I decided to go with some friends to visit anotehr friend in Toronto. So as we went on in our journey, i still had a lot of spare time to my own and was able to have a time of reflection. It came to my mind that i must be one of the angriest person alive. I came to that conclusion after enumerating all of the time i demonstrated some kind of anger manifestation. As a result, it was an endless and bottomless pit of events that occured. But mostly, what happened during the trip made me realized that as i gazed through the stars at night.  Now, there are many types of angry people out there, but the most dangerous ones are the silent ones...so just to avoid being a happy member of that group, i, once and a while, try to express my anger.  Well let's just start with the driving experience to toronto...oh don't get me started with this(see Need For Speed Posting), to add to this, well have you ever had the impression that people giving you direction seems to take in account that whatever they tell you, seems to be comingout from one ear and going out by the other. but in reality, you actually hear them, know the way and chose to ignore them, so you then angrily show that you have acknowledge their saying and of course that usually doesn't come out as friendly as you would want it to be.  If that wasn't enough to tick you off, well there's a couple of situation where for some unknown reason, whenever you want something, there will always be some retard if not stupid, that will do everything in their powers(of course unconsiously) in order for you to failed at getting what you want. Let me tell you what happened in a little town named Cooksville, located in the suburb region of Toronto. As we drove back from the beach, we stopped at a Tim Hortons for directions, and a snack. So as i decided to take a mokaccino, i had a sudden urge for a strawberry chocolate tarts...you know like the one's in the commercials. so as i start to take in my order, here is what happened: Tim Horton Cashier(THC): Hi, can I take your order? Me: Yeah, i'll take a mokaccino, and a chocolate-strawberry tart THC: ok, anything else me: no.. as she prepares my mokaccino, another THC comes in and asks for the next person's command. she then puts in a white container and the THC that took my order came and gave me the mokaccino. THC: here you go. me looking suspiciously: Oh,sorry but i had ordered a tart too THC: yeah it's right here in the container. me: oh, sorry! i didn't know it was from me THC: oh it's ok. so as i walked anxioulsy towards my seat in a ogrely fashion, ready to devoure my tart, i opened the white conent, only to realize that it was a regular tart and not something i had ordered. so i went back to the counter. me: excuse me, i had ordered a chocolate tart, but this is a regular tart. the same THC that served me: oh, it's cause we don't have anymore before i could say anything, she went on. THC: wait let me check something THC: Hey Mac, do we have any more chocolate tart(outloud) Mac: nope, we don't have anymore. THC: sorry we don't have anymore.(smiles innocently) So i stood there, very dissapointed, wondering why would she have serve me a regular tart, when she knew there were not any more left, or if she didn't know, why wouldshe just lie to me and pretend nothing hapened...Did she think that a regular strawberry tart would pass unnoticed from my ogrely appetite for a chocolate tart. Well as angry as i was, I then realized that it was just a tart..nothing more..so i walked off and said it's ok.  As i stood in the car seat, wondering again and getting so angry about that THC for about 15min, i then decided to release my anger in my appetite for the regular strawberry tart. As I unleashed hell upon the tart, with my berserk and ogrely manners, i slapped down the tart in my face in a fashionable way as any good barbarian or norsemen would do in the glory times of vikings.   Only that night, have i realized that the anger in me was very strong, yet it was only for a tart...hinting me that i must be a very angry person to get so upset for such a little thing. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRHGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH condemne that THC to the bottomless pit of hell for lying about that chocolate tart!!! well this posting is not as good as the one i had initially written, but the damn session on my laptop had expired and i had lots everything. hence lost the pure essence of anger and sarcasm i had initially put; yet i never learn and continue to directly write in the session box, instead of using temporarily notepad...*orc-ish grunt
