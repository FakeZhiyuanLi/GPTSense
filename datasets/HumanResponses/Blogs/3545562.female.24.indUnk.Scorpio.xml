      As I was creating my profile, I realized that despite the many books I know I've read in my life, I could only come up with four that are my favorites.  And that's not just my favorites, but only four I could remember reading.  There was of course the whole Babysitter's Club series during my pre-teen years...I remember I used to wish that Ann M. Martin would die (pretty morbid for a 10 yr old) just so I could finish the last book and say, "that's it, I read them all."  But no, she just kept churning out new stories for Kristi and the gang.  So I just stopped reading around book 50.  I couldn't take it anymore.  No more Staci, no more Mary Anne.  I will always remember this line from the book, after Dawn fell down (don't remember why) but one of the kids said, "Have a nice TRIP, see you next FALL!"  I thought it was hilarious.  Now I realize- not so funny.   Later, Reagan a.k.a. "unofficial member of the Babysitter's Club"

      This is it, time to be interesting.  I mean, am I supposed to funny in these things?  Or deep?  I don't know the rules people, this is new to me.  I guess I'll just write some crap.  Basically, I'm at work, I'm bored, and I have no one to talk to.  So I'll talk to myself, in a diary, online...for 10's of people to see.  Last night was my roommate Ashley's birthday, we went to dinner at a restuarant in Silverlake called Cha Cha Cha's.  Don't really have much to say, the food was spicy, I was tired, and I was being entertained by a hodge podge of friends, good acquaintances, and Ashley's co-workers.  Anyway...this is the worst blog ever, so I'll just get it out of the way and hope I have more to say later. Peace out, Reags

      Ben Lee....he played on Carson last night (I didn't see it, but Derrick taped it- a*hole better not erase it- I love you D!) Okay, he played two new songs "Gamble everything on love" and "Right Angles"...two wonderful, amazing songs!  I finished pseudo-stalking him while he was in LA.  I hope to pick up where I left off when he returns in the future.

      today's is my ex-roommate's birthday and we're celebrating by going to none other than....drum roll please....chili's bar and grill.  no, we're not in middle america (where i grew up chili's was it, except for applebee's across the street), but rather LA where there are plenty of other options of where to dine out.  what can i say, the boy loves his chili's.  i made him a card, as if i were 8 again (get the reference, ems?)  and for my current roommate's birthday, i made her a card as well.  because what says i love you more than some magazine pictures pasted haphazardly onto a piece of computer paper.  i don't even have markers, so i used my one and only highlighter...a pretty pink.  ashley seemed to like hers, she even put it on top of the tv with the "real" cards.  my, how i've changed.  i used to be all about the e-cards, the free ones, b/c i'm a cheap bastard.  "it's the thought that counts" is what i'm all about.  hey, you should be lucky if i even remember your birthday, so here's your homemade card, take it and like it.

      This is the question of the moment.  I love it- did miss glamourous actress/singer/perfume proprietor actually have a shotgun wedding?  I like to think that she did.  And in less than 9 months she'll squeeze one out and do the whole "my life didn't mean anything until I became a mother" routine until a few weeks later when she passes the thing off to a nanny.  I wonder what she'll name it...it has to begin with a letter that goes well with Lo...like T. Lo...or K. Lo.  Just some suggestions.

      Wilson Phillips is coming out with a new record of cover songs, so to commemorate this event, I started thinking about the early 90's.  I used to go back b/w Wendy or Chynna being my favorite band member...sorry Carnie, I was a shallow pre-teen.  I wouldn't doubt if there were several times that I sang "Hold on" or "Release me" with my eyes closed and my fist clinched tightly- really "feeling" the music.  I was also a "Fine Young Cannibals" fan, but I think this was my mothers doing (I think it was her CD).  Should I be ashamed?  Were they cool (by standards of the time)?  I remember one time at a pizza party at Mr. Gatti's or something like that, I kept putting quarter after quarter into the jukebox to hear "Red Red Wine"....but wait, that was UB40...I'm getting my bands mixed up.  The thing was f*ed up, so I never got to hear the song.  Moving on...my brother and I used to rock out to Twisted Sister's "We're not gonna take it"- I was one rebellious 10 yr old in my neon pink lycra onesie.  Then my mother confiscated it.  And the defiance was over, back to Guns n' Roses.  Paradise City...loved it. I wanted to go there.  For me, that city was Shreveport, Louisiana- they had a water park.  Not even a good one- all they had was one big slide and a wave pool.  It was the crack addict version of a water park.  Damn you Mom and Dad- why couldn't we just go to Dallas!

      I can't wait for the bracelets!  Another new diet craze, to purify your insides....and your soul.  They cleverly named it the "Hallelujah Diet".  I want to go on this diet just so I can use that phrase in conversation.  Here's how it might go: Other person: "I really need to lose some weight, but I've tried everything.  What's your secret?" Me: "Why, I'm on the Hallelujah Diet." Other person: "Never heard of it...is it a version of Atkins?" Me: "Not at all, it consists of following God's perfect boundaries of hunger and fullness." Other person: "What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Me: "The Lord gave us everything we need in the Garden of Eden...fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds" Other person:  "Fuck that, I'm doing South Beach." That's just an example.  The conversation would heavily depend on who the other person is.  I was reading an article about how all the stars maintain their weight.  One secret...shhh, don't tell anyone- laxatives.  How very glamourous.  The whole obsession over weight baffles me.  I prefer to eat like a pig, not exercise, and then complain that I can't seem to lose weight.   R.

      Thanks Emily for this creative if not too obvious twist on his name.  I've become even more obsessed with him him lately, especially since he's on all the magazine covers.  GQ, EW- consider this my thanks.  I want to frame him.  Literally, I want to put him in a glass case and hang him on my wall.  I know that we will never be, b/c honestly, how many people end up dating their stalker.  I think it happened on "Friends" once, but c'mon people, that's television, not reality.  Though in my dreams, we meet, I saw "Hi" he says "I love you" and we take it from there. Sincerely yours, (warning: I cannot stop myself from writing the following thing) Reagan Gyllenhaal (If it's in writing, it must be true!)

      so many of my friends put themselves through so much sh*t for guys...i'm wondering, what is this power they have?  i think it may be magic, but not good magic like harry potter, more like black magic.  the bad kind.  i freak out the moment i like a guy b/c i automatically go into "they don't like me, i'm ugly" mode.  it's not a good place to be.  so maybe, after all this time of thinking it's them, maybe it's me.  am i a self-fulfilling prophecy?  i think in my perfect world, everyone would fall in love with my (at times) witty sense of humor and appreciate the fact that i don't practically bone them just to show i'm interested.  i like to play it subtle, but even when i do lay it on thick, it's still just me joking around.  can someone out there teach me to bat my eyes?  what exactly are "hot pants" and where can i get some?  i basically have one move, touching the other person affectionately.  i learned in from television.  i laugh at some joke, maybe put my hand on his shoulder as to say "oh [insert name here], you're so funny, i like you a lot."  what i'm actually thinking is "do me now."  but that's not as appropriate.  and the light touching of the shoulder does not convey that.  that's what humping the leg is for (a move i tried on my old roommate, but he just laughed).  anyway, i digress...men are evil.  but i can't say that without saying the same thing about women.  forget stereotypes, but we can really be whiny little bitches.  i mean, has anyone read "the rules"?  i haven't, so i shouldn't have even brought it up, but i did read something about a rule that the guy must call by wednesday to accept a saturday date.  ridiculous.  i say, call before 7, and i'm ready to go at 9.  is that too desperate?  should i be playing hard to get?  man, this stuff is all too complicated.  and now i must get back to work...i hate mondays. reagan "never make anyone a priority who only considers you an option"

      dear friendster, it's over.   i remember when you were all the rage- instead of exchanging phone numbers or emails, it was "look me up on friendster"...which is almost as cool (or lame, depending on your perspective) as "i'm in the book" (something i will still say at one point).  but now you've stopped delivering my messages.  you tease me by emailing to say that i've got a new message, but then when i get to my inbox, there's nothing there.  why are you so cruel?  i should have listened to micheal and moved to myspace.   yeah, that's right, i said it.   i don't know, maybe we can work this out.  i keep coming back for more...i have to read the bulletin board to find out everyones top 5 albums they're listening to right now or the 5th sentence on page 23 of the book they're reading.  these things i cannot live without.  especially when i'm at work.  and bored out of my ever loving mind.  as i am right now.  i refuse to abandon my 57 first degree friends, or my 1,892 second degree friends...or even my 61,809 third degree friends.  they wouldn't do that to me and i'm sure as hell not going to do that to them. someday i'll make it official and post a real picture of myself.  you just have to show me that you're willing to work as hard at this relationship as i am.  i think i've said enough. your friend, reagan

      Emily, you're the coolest.  I want to be you.  I want to dress like, talk like you, dance like you (that's a maybe, I don't remember any of your moves), and just inherit all of the coolness that is you.  Boys don't get this for many reasons: 1.  They realize that they will never be as funny/smart/rad as you. 2.  They don't want to be the "ugly" one in the couple. 3.  They want to f*ck you gently, but are afraid you won't call the next day. 4.  They know that it will take a lot to satisfy a life force like yourself- this scares them. 5.  They know that there is someone better out there for you so you should just wait until that person comes along. There are many more reasons, but honestly, who has the time to write out every single one.  You know I don't, must get back to work (or back to staring at the wall).  Next time a boy makes you doubt your awesomeness...read this.  Take it in.  Memorize it.  Live by it.  Peace, Reagan

      I've never been in love before, which is a little ridiculous since I'm almost 25 years old.  I've thought I was, but I don't think it counts if you're not even dating the person.  When I tell my friends this, the ones who have been there, they always say "no, you don't, love is hell."  And what do I say to this- bring. it. on. I want love and all the shit that comes with it.  Give me tears, give me fights, give me...well, whatever else there is.  Why does this all sound so exciting to me?  I just don't think the highs are ever as good without the lows.  How can you feel joy if you don't know pain?  Nothing can be perfect... I want the passion that comes with those fights, I want to care so much it drives me crazy.  I worry that I will go through my whole life never knowing this feeling.  I know, I know...I'm young.  But what if I'm still wanting for this when I'm 30?  40?  90???  Okay, probably not 90, I would have given up by then.  Or I'll be dead.  And who will put flowers at my grave? Reagan...aka "the lonely"  I can't end it like that.  You never find what you're looking for.  So I'm not looking.  Now it can sneak up on me.  My back is turned.  My eyes are closed.  Maybe it will tap me on my left shoulder when it is actually on my right.  I've fallen for that trick before.

      I read this article about blogs in Time and it was talking about how they've become an important forum for cultural, political, etc. discussion.  And how there are all these people becoming celebrities because of their blogs.  And now some blogs are even being supported by advertisers.  And I just wanted something to do while I was bored at work.  I know I've touched some lives out there (last time...emily, katie).  But I can't have you girls relying on me as a "role model".  I'm not perfect, despite what many people might say.  I'm only human, not a "goddess" or "angel", words that are often tossed around when my name is mentioned.  As for the advertisers, well, let's just say that you guys won't have to worry about my blog being tainted by corporate panhandling (mainly because no one's asking).  In summation, I will continue to talk about the most unimportant topics pulled from either my daily life or random memories from my childhood.  For those of you waiting on bated breath for a follow up to the large underwear story, keep tuning in.  yours truly, reagan

      I cannot wait for Garden State to open and then everyone can know the wonder that is Zach Braff.  I've had a thing for the guy since "Broken Hearts Club"...I hoped that he was a good actor and not actually gay, though my chances would probably be the same either way.  Then I met him one night at the Hotel Cafe, not in a friendly manner, but with the fine line of fan-admired dividing us.  I felt a connection- did you feel it to Zach?  Maybe a little, when I said, "I love you on Scrubs".  It's so original, so clever, how could you not fall in love with me?  I await your big screen magnificance.

      I hate when you ask someone to do something and they say "maybe" in this way that implies that they are just not interested.  What is the big deal with saying "no"?  I remember one time a friend invited me to do something and I said, "Doesn't sound like fun...I'm not in" or something like that.  It was as if I called her grandmother a whore-saying no is apparantly unacceptable.  We live by these ridiculous terms of politeness where the socially acceptable thing to do is pretend you're going to go somewhere with someone and then back out at the last minute.  My technique is not answering the phone, and then making up some excuse later.  I need that extra day to come up with something really believable, such as "I was sick" or "I didn't hear the phone ring."  Then I can always wait until I get to work on Monday and send my excuse via email.  Yes, I like to avoid confrontation.  And now that I've removed all the smoke and mirrors, everyone will know what a shithead I can truly be.  But who hasn't done this?  I know I'm not alone, and I'm sure others out there have much more clever maneuvers than myself.  What I'm trying to say is that I wouldn't have to deal with this crap if I could just say "no" in the first place.  Lesson learned.  Everyone live by my code of human interaction.

      I use IM a lot, because I often find myself bored to tears at work.  But I'm still learning what so many of these "codes" mean.  It took me a while to figure out "lol" meant "laugh out loud"- not "lots of love".  I wondered why these people I barely knew were expressing such sentiments.  When my brother IM's me, I can barely tell what he is saying and I wonder why he feels the need to use so many shortcuts.  He's not in a hurry.  Why rush things...type out "talk to you later" rather than "ttyl"...does it save that much time?  Of course, I often have the inabiltity to spell things out like the college graduate I am...example: a sentence such as "what are you doing" will come out reading "whard yug arjls".  Thus confusing the recipient and making me look like I'm typing while intoxicated.   I also like that I shorten "ok" to just "k".  Because if I were even to think about typing that "o" it would set me back light years in terms of productivity.  I cannot risk this.  I shouldn't knock it- I often wonder what people did at work to entertain themselves in the old days (you know, the early-mid 90's)  Maybe I would read more if I had no one to talk/type to.  And maybe I would be better off.   reagan

      Coco.  That's what David and Courtney decided to name their new bebe.  Take that Apple!  Sounds like the name of a monkey...in fact, wasn't the first talking monkey named Coco?  I really think so.  Enough with this, I'm leaving for Austin in 2 days and cannot wait.  I needs my break.  Last night, I became addicted to Bravo.  Officially, I already said that I love the celebrity poker, but after watching a marathon of Showbiz Moms & Dads then an ep. of Blow Out, I'm hooked.  I suggest anyone reading this (again, hi Emily, hi Katie) check out this fine programming.  It's like cocaine for the mind.  I have a friend staying with me and instead of doing fun stuff (i.e. leaving the house) I just sat on the couch with my eyes glazed over all night.  Yeah, living it up in So Cal.  And I might just do the same thing tonight, but mix it up with a little laundry action.  I need clean underwear.  One time I was so lazy that instead of washing my clothes, I bought new underwear at Walgreens.  The only size they had was gigantic, so now I have 3 pairs of the biggest cotton panties even invented.  That's right fellas, close your eyes and you can see it.  It's sublime.  I just laughed out loud to my own story.  I'm lame.  But who out there didn't already know that? Reagie

      Well, the Olsen twins are now officially legal, thus taking away some of the charm that is statutory rape.  They are so rich I actually experience physical pain thinking about it.  I wonder if they had a Hilton style celebration- a 4 city birthday tour.  Does this mean more drunken pics of the gruesome twosome are going to surface?  If I was their friend, I would sell pictures of them to all the major magazines and then be like "no Mary Kate, I don't know how they got that picture of you and Ashley making out."  I'd play it so coy.  Then I'd buy shoes with the money.  And candy.   R.

      Courtney Cox-Arquette had her baby.  They haven't released the name, but I'm sure it will be weird.  That's usually the way it goes with celeb kiddies (Audio Science anyone?)  I used to read imdb news everyday...now I basically scan it and only actually read very few of the postings.  These are the things I don't even bother with: 1. J. Lo 2. Courtney Love 3. Micheal Jackson And you're almost guaranteed to see one of those people on there every day.  For example, today is a story about how Courtney Love assaulted a woman with a beer bottle.  I am shocked.  That doesn't sound like Ms. Love at all.  Why she is a refined woman of old fashioned values who is more likely to pet a kitten rather than hurt another human being.  At what point do they just post "Courtney Love f*cked up again".  That I would read- short, sweet, and to the point.  Same with J. Lo.  I can get all the info I need from the headings.  "Is J. Lo pregnant?"  I don't know- is she?  I can ponder this on my own, I don't need expert opinions for me to figure this one out.  And all this stuff about Micheal Jackson.  C'mon people...he's so guilty.  Stop sending your kids to his house.  Yeah, so we need more celebrities to gossip about.  Anything at all...I'll even take a story about carrot top over these three media whores (well, j. lo's really the only media whore, the other two are just media whores by criminal association)  Reags

      I'm having one of those days where everything is pissing me off.  The sound of the phone ringing has been like nails down a chalk board to me.  And I have lost the ability to smile.  What if I never get it back?  What if I am unable to show any expression for the rest of my life?  Oh man, I hope I get over this.  I just took a 20 min nap during lunch while watching The Cosby Show, and now I feel like I'm going to drag ass for the rest of the day.  Less than 4 hours.  Oh, the thought of that much longer pains me.  I will talk about something else.  My weekend.  Friday night- chinese food and watched Monster.  Saturday- went to Hermosa Beach, played a little frisbee and paddle ball (two pseudo-sports I can add to my list of "things I suck at").  And Saturday night, the ultimate flashback- girls slumber party.  The plan was to watch girly movies (Girls just want to have fun, Clueless...you know the type), do faces masks, read beauty mags, eat pizza, etc.  In reality, we ate pizza and got smashed.  Very different from the slumber parties I went to when I was 12.  So...woke up feeling like ass on Sunday and laid around my apartment all day.  I watched Celebrity Poker (which I'm addicted to) and a little of the movie "Heavyweights" about these kids at fat camp.  Then there was my raison d'etre...Six Feet Under.  Man, how I've missed the whole gang- Nate, Claire, David, Brenda, etc.  And how excited am I about Justin Theroux being on the show?  The answer is very excited.  I was glad to see Russell again, mainly b/c of how much I fancy Ben Foster as an actor.  The previews for next week showed Mena Suvari and I'm really hoping they don't make Claire a lesi.  Yeah, so...that's my weekend.  Obviously nothiing to thrilling.  Sorry for wasting your time.  reagan

      I am such a procrastinator.  I so need to get my oil changed, have been planning to do it all week, yet keep saying "I'll do it tomorrow".  Same with diets...it's always "diet starts tomorrow" as I'm stuffing my face with half a pizza.  Yeah, so no oil change today, instead going with my co-workers to target, we all got gift cards from a client yesterday.  It's thrilling.  Somehow saying "it's thrilling" without an exclamation mark just doesn't give the same effect as "it's thrilling!".  Side note, sorry.  I feel like I only use exclamation marks b/c I feel that I'm supposed to...same with the smiley face.  You know- :)  I def. overuse it b/c while I'm sitting at work, bored, talking to Sarah online, often repeating the exact conversation we had the day before...and then I add :)  Doesn't necessarily mean I'm smiling, just means I have run out of stuff to say.  It's an easy response to what someone has written you- instead of commenting, just reply :)  This blog is basically a way for me to pass time at work, if you haven't caught on.  I watched the Simple Life 2 last night...I hate it and love it at the same time.  My friend Ved said the best quote ever about Paris Hilton- "I want to hate-fuck her"...and now I use that as much as possible.  Overuse it some would say.  Now that I think about it, maybe she said that about Hillary Duff...either way, made me laugh.   Reagan

      I can not be trusted.  When it comes to keeping plans.  I always back out, but if someone does it to me, I could bitch about it for days.  My friend Sarah asked me to meet her at a bar tonight.  And at this point I honestly want to go.  But knowing me, I'll get tired around 9 and back out.  I have no energy, none.  When I get tired, my eyes lose focus and I feel like my head is going to drop off my body.  And this happens almost on a daily basis.  Maybe I have some rare disease that my general practioner doctor has been unable to detect.  I have always had the fear that I'm slowly dying and I don't know it...but not in the way that we're all dying.  Something is slowly killing me but I'm too unaware to have it checked out.  Hypochondriac or just weird?  As I said to Sarah (referring to beginning of post) you can't motivate the unmotivated.  Wow Reagan, you're wisdom astounds us all.  I want to come up with a saying. My friend Theresa came up with the idea of writing a "warm" check...where technically it's hot but you're putting money in the bank the next day...thus making it warm.  I thought this was clever and according to her this saying would "spread like wildfire".  But I have nothing to offer...no "don't worry be happy", no "kill two birds with one stone" etc.  How else will I be immortalized? Reagan

      Ashley and I were talking last night about scenes in movies where the woman says "let me slip into something more comfortable" and then comes out in lingerie.  We thought it would be funny if instead she came out wearing our version of comfortable- pajama pants and a t-shirt, most likely stained or with holes or both.  It's not as sexy, but a whole lot funnier.  I wonder if women still wear business shirts to bed.  My mom is obsessed with buying me pajamas, ignoring the fact that I always sleep in an old t-shirt.  I used to sleep in the buff as a child and I was always afraid Santa would see me naked.  Wow, that's f'ed up.  I was also afraid of there being a fire and having to run outside naked.  I could have solved this problem by PUTTING ON SOME DAMN CLOTHES!  But no, I was a free spirit.  Things have changed since then- now I only strip to shower.  And on the weekends.

      I was going through some boxes of my old stuff and decided to let you know what I found: 1.  A pair of bell bottoms that I had painted for the 8th grade hippie dance.  First of all, I didn't have bell bottoms, so my mom made them.  I used puff paint to draw flowers and peace signs and other "hippie" symbols.  The funniest thing is I wrote the word "Weed" under the ass part, and I remember, I didn't want it to be too visible, but I thought it was cool.  Now I know that people were probably laughing at me.  I would have laughed at me.  Needless to say, I danced alone that night. 2.  I found an old diary from when I was around 14.  I've read this out loud to friends before because it is great comedic writing, though at the time I don't think that's what I was going for.  I just read the first page, but I talked about how I hung out with my cousin on New Years Eve playing video games until 3 in the morning.  According to me, this was "awesome".  Little did I know it would all go down hill from there. 3.  Apparantly, back in 94 and 95 (once again, 14ish) I saved all my returned homework in a cardboard filing thing.  I have no idea why I did this.  4.  I found an old scrapbook I started back in 91.  On the first page is a picture of Fred Savage I tore out from what looks like the TV Guide.  Beside it I wrote: "This is Fred Savage.  He is on the Wonder Years.  I am truly in love with him."  So I have been in love!  The rest of the book had ribbons from football games, our team was the Gilmer Buckeyes.  Our mascot was a nut- not very intimidating.  Nothing like the Pirate from my High School years...aarrr! 5.  Misc other crap- a pair of Swiss clogs I used to have as a decoration and I one time made my younger neighbor wear around.  All the "break a leg" cards I got for my starring role in Oklahoma (both a blessing and a curse- after that I was typecast as the old lady in all the school productions).  I found a t-shirt I bought in London in the 8th grade that was too big for me now and said "London" in big silver letters (I think it was the cheapest one I could find).   So that's my life in a box.  I think I stopped saving most stuff after the age of 15.  From 18-now I only have a small box of stuff, and most of it is old concert stubs.  All star for most embarrassing: Britney Spears (yes, it's true) and Limp Bizkit (Fred called all the ladies up on stage during "Faith"...I didn't go).  All I can say is "Why?" Reagan

      Please, ignore the title.  I couldn't help myself.  I just typed a long post and it wouldn't publish.  Oh well, it sucked anyway.  So rumor is Britney Spears is ready to walk down the aisle with her dancer beau.  Britney, if you're listening, I think this is a bad idea.  I know you think he's cute and all...and you really like his dance moves, but didn't you just get married not that long ago?  Maybe you should wait for the ink to dry on your annullment papers.  You are a papparazzo's wet dream.   xoxo, Reagan

      That would be the name of my advice column.  If I had one. I stole it from an episode of "Just Shoot Me"...it was David Spade's alias.  Yeah...I'm always giving out what I deem to be good advice- mainly because of my practical approach and distaste for bullsh*t.  Like many people, I can dish it out, but never take it.  So I started thinking, what would I say to someone who came to me with a problem involving a houseguest they want out.  Because if someone came to me with this problem, I bet I would really have something helpful to say.  But the person is me, and I can't help myself.  Emily's advice is "just stay busy this week and she'll be gone soon enough".  Sounds like a plan, probably the same thing I'd say to someone else.  Now I just need to heed her advice and stop obsessing.  But that's what I do best.  My apartment is no longer mine, it's been taken over.  I can't wait until next Wednesday.

      I hate coming back to work after a vacation.  I feel so lost.  I almost had a heart attack when I saw all the papers strewn across my desk (anal retentive neat freak).  I took a few deep breaths and got to work restoring my desk to it's original condition, with the stapler and whole puncher positioned at right angles and everthing filed in it's respective folder.  If anyone is wondering "Did Reagan have a good time in Austin" then the answer is "Yes I did, thank you for asking."  Because I'm not a phone person, I only told one person I was coming in town and hoped they would just spread the word, like a game of telephone, though I hope it would change from "Reagan's coming to town" to "Reagan's preganant with Usher's baby".  Don't know why I used Usher, that's kind of weird.  Anyway, so Austin.  I hung out with my gal Emily majority of the time.  We saw a midnight screening of "Dodgeball" at midnight on Thursday, with an actualy game of dodgeball beforehand.  I didn't particpate because I'm about as athletic as a....don't know how to finish that, let's just say I'm weak.  However, it was hilarious watching others play- everyone was so serious, as if there was money or a trophy at stake, not just lame bragging rights.  My dad did note that he was dodgeball champion back in the day, maybe I should have given it the old college try, seeing as how the talent for chunking balls at people's heads runs in the family.  The movie was hilarious, I laughed the entire time.  Favorite line: "You're about as useless as a poo flavored lollipop."  I keep repeating this line, because it's still making me laugh.  What can I say, I'm terribly immature.  I had forgotten how hot it is in Texas- the humidity, the mosquitos, the constant sweating.  I was ready to come back to LA where the only thing that bites is the people.  Ba dum dum (drum for comedic effect, if you didn't get that).  One time someone said to me if you have to explain a joke, then it's not funny.  Story of my life.  Until next time...this is Reagan, signing off.

      I am my own boss right now.  Seriously.  My boss left and said "I doubt you'll stay until closing."  In my head, this gives me the liberty to get the hell out of here whenever I damn well please.  If that was true, I wouldn't be typing this now b/c I'd be at home napping.  So I'm going to the beach for the 4th.  I need some sun, I'm starting to get that shut-in look.  I need a tan...bad.  So that's my plan for Sunday.  I have a tendency to make plans for every moment of the weekend, then I only end up doing half of them.  I'm not a machine, I can't go 24/7.  More like 8/3.  I'm like an old lady trapped in the body of a 24 year old.  Damn kids!  That's what old ladies say as they shake their brooms at the neiborhood trouble makers.  Yeah....right...so being my own boss is nice.  I just picked up my cell phone and randomly called someone.  Just because I could. I'm such a freakin' rebel.  After acting as an airport chauffeur for the past two days (after taking infamous houseguest, I took my roommate today at 5 in the f'in am) I'm a little on the sleepy side.  Last night I fell asleep on the couch at 945.  I don't want to repeat that tonight- I'm only working a half day tomorrow, what do I need all that rest for?  Nothing, that's what.  Reagan p.s. For those following my diet progress...I turned down a cupcake today.  It looked so good, with rich creamy icing and chocolaty brown goodness...what was I thinking???!!!

      my friend is writing a script and asked me this question: what's the most tender thing that you could see a guy could doing, which would make your heart break and totally blow you away.  i have nothing.  i don't even have anything to pull from my "fantasy" bank, much less real life experience.  i think i'm too much of a skeptic to be blown away.  when i think of things, it's always something that's been done before: someone holding a boom box over their head outside my window while playing peter gabriel; someone telling me that i complete them (to which i would reply "you had me at hello"); someone painting a beautiful picture of me while we have great conversation as a party goes on downstairs; someone coming to my house and saying "i was nowhere near your neighborhood"...cameron crowe is a romantic god.  i'm at a loss to come up with original material that would "make my heart break".  as in a previous post, i think it would definitely be someone telling me they love me, flaws and all.  never heard this before.  i don't know why i'm obsessed with this idea.   when i think about it, i wonder how i would respond...knowing me, i'd make a joke.  sarah said that at this point when a guy says "hi" it's the most romantic thing.  sometimes all it takes for me is someone lighting my cigarette.  or opening a door (even though i hate that i like something so old fashioned...it gets really awkward though when i try to open the door for the guy).  or remember my f*cking name.  have i lowered my standards?  i'm still really picky when it comes to who i date, but yet not so much when it comes to who i like.  does this make sense?  i decided i wasn't going to care anymore b/c i don't want to be one of those girls who complains all the time about not having a  boyfriend.  you're probably thinking that i am...but this is just something that is on my mind..right now...and at other times...but not all the time.  for me to want to date someone, actually spend time with them on a regular basis, they have to be as interesting as my friends.  if they're not, why would i want to waste my time?  maybe i'm too obsessed with my friends.  why do i ask so many questions?  i'm like a child.  as of now i don't give a f*ck (except i obviously do)...i'm just going to do what i want and not think about rules or when to call (more likely email...it is my lifeline) or what to say or what they think or what they think i think...it's all such bullsh*t.  and it's neverending. ashley asked if this kind of crap goes away as we get older, and sadly, i don't think it does. reagan aka debbie downer

      Is it a bad sign that it's only 10:54 and I'm already bored.  And annoyed.  Same shit, different day...as they say.  I tried to start watching Nip/Tuck but I can't stomach it...last night a character tried to perform a rhinoplasty on himself.  Craziness.  I realized it's not for me by the fact that I had my eyes closed for half the episode...so what's the point.  Am I really that hard up to watch TV that I'm willing to watch something that makes me want to vomit?  I'm not going to answer that. I had to take houseguest to the airport at 630 this morning...I felt like that episode of Seinfeld where Elaine is trying to get the guy out of her apt so he won't miss his plane.  If you've seen it, you might be laughing.  As a person who usually wakes up at the last minute possible and is still a few minutes late to work (funny, since I'm anal about being on time for anything else) being up that early hasn't happened since a) I was 6 and woke up to watch cartoons before school or b) I was still up from the night before.  I love it when people yell at me for things that have nothing to do with me.  Just a side note.   Reagan

      Have you ever had one of those days where you think no one will ever love you in that love story kind of way?  Woe is me, right?  But I was chatting with Sarah about the last time we went on a date.  Not together, with other people.  Last date for me- October.  Freakin' October.  And because I have this fear of getting in a relationship unless the person lives up to all these expectations, I turned him down for a second date.  I'm so lame.  Instead I'm destined to wander the earth alone whining about how no boys like me.  I just want someone to find some of the annoying stuff I do endearing.  Like in the movies...he'll say to me (in the climax monologue of the movie): Him: I love it that you always have to be on time (and one time even showed up for a birthday party a week early- 7th grade).  I love how your apartment can be trashed, but if a picture frame is crooked, you have to straighten it (OCD).  I love that you iron your jeans (I'm alone in this behavior and quite aware of it).  I love that bite your nails when you're nervous or just bored (a habit I can't quite grow out of).  I love that you cry when you fight because it's too intense (crying does not mean the other person will let you win- you just seem more pathetic).   Okay, those are a few examples.  Believe you me, there are many more.  I'm sure readers out there are listing many others either in their heads or on paper if they feel like being cruel.  The only way to fight the sadness that is being lonely is with bitterness.  I'm really good at this.  I think I could go pro.   Reagan :( On a brighter note....I'm really not lonely.  That's such a sad word.  I just want someone to make out with.

      Word on the street (by street I mean Good Day Live and an anonymous source) is that Mary Kate isn't at an anorexic treatment center, but rather at a rehab facility to treat her COKE ADDICTION!  Shocking, scandalous...true?  I don't know, but I like the idea that it could be.  Doing coke is a great way to shed those unwanted pounds...Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy a whole lot of blow.  Ha ha, I made myself laugh with my little sayings.  They're not even funny now that I reread them.  Nevertheless, I hope for a speedy recovery for there is no "Olsen Twins" with just one.  Maybe this was all part of their master plan to separate from each other...there's the good one (Ashley) and the crack whore (Mary Kate).  That was mean, I apologize MK.  Last night I finally told houseguest what I thought of her...this all came to pass when I realized she had eaten every one of my granola bars.  10 of them.  This may seem petty, but it was the last straw...I first paced outside while quickly inhaling a cigarette and talking to my roomie on the phone (who, being so sick of houseguest, had refused to come home).  I marched inside not so subtly showing my anger my whisking the beads leading to our hallway with avid determination...then went to my room and semi-slammed my door (it was actually the result of my window being open and the wind pushing it shut, but was appropriate for the situation).  After a moment, I hear the tiniest "must proceed with caution" knock...houseguest is wondering if I'm mad at her.  So then the shit hit the fan and I listed off every way in which she has pissed us off.  I ended with the affirmation "you are never welcome to stay with us ever again."  ***I left off a lot that happened in the middle, but don't feel like rehashing the entire event.  These are just the broad strokes***  Continuing...So as of Wednesday, no more houseguest.  My life can go back to normal (or at least to how it was before).  Victory has never tasted so sweet.

      I've caved in and started dieting.  No, I'm not giving up carbs.  I would never, I loves my pasta way too much.  And my bread.  And my waffles...and chips...etc.  I just decided it's time stop eating as if I'm eating for two.  Let's ignore the fact that in my previous post I admitted to eating almost half a pizza (minus 1 slice...we all know what happened with that).  This was a minor slip up induced by a hangover.  Other than that, my new motto remains: "Nothing tastes as good as being thin feels".  I love it- makes me laugh.  Because who truly believes this?  I don't- I mean, have you ever had BBQ Chicken pizza?  Anyway, I'm tired of talking about this.  And I'm sure you're tired of reading about my lame diet.  If you're still with me, let's take a trip down memory lane.  As I was driving back from lunch, I started thinking about the scene from Rad where Cru and Lori Loughlin dance on bikes to "Send me an Angel".  Man I loved that movie.  I remember how much I wanted to be able to do tricks with my bike, but I could barely use my peg stands.  Then when I went to the bike track I couldn't even start at the top of the hill, I started at the bottom with my Dad holding onto the back of my bike as I summoned up all my courage to take the 3 feet plunge down to flat ground.  I was never meant to be a BMX'er.  Side note, I am so hard up for Franz Ferdinand right now.  Love them.  After all the hype, I finally bought the CD.  I'm not afraid of being behind the times.

      So...for the first time in quite a while, I actually "went out" this weekend, and not just to the beach or to a movie.  I saw Farenheit 9/11 on Friday...see it for yourself.  Don't feel like going into it.  Went to Saddle Ranch afterwards where my friend rode the bull.  Maybe I'm alone, but this activity is not very entertaining to me.  A bunch of girls showing off their ass cleavage only to be thrown off a few seconds later.  Sat went to Birds then to a make-shift after party where we played beer pong til the wee hours of the morning.  I felt like I was back in college and I liked it.  Though I had one hell of a hangover on Sunday, the most movement I did was moving from my bed where I napped most of the day to the couch where I watched TV in a semi-conscious state.  Only thing that would have made it better is if houseguest had not been there so I could have stretched my little legs all the way out rather than lying in a border line fetal position.  I ate half a pizza, but it still pissed me off when houseguest ate my last piece.  As I glared at her while she ate it, I screamed in my head "That's my sausage piece, you had the pepperoni....why god why!!!!"  On that note...I actually have work to do.  More later.

      I'm not feeling so great today.  I feel like I'm going to vomit.  I'm sure that is something everyone wanted to know.  Maybe it was the coffee...I knew I shouldn't have had two cups.  Wow, I really feel weird.  My head is spinning.  It feels like a hangover, yet I didn't drink last night.  And it's not fair to have the hangover feeling without the fun that usually precedes it.  I have to take my car to the shop this weekend.  I'm such a f'in idiot when it comes to cars- all I can tell the mechanics is "the engine sounds weird".  When I tell my Dad, he always asks "what's it doing?".  Fuck if I know, it sounds like it's being tortured.  I don't even know what pieces are under the hood- engine, oil thing, air filter...what else, I don't know.  Then my Dad and I get in a fight about the car- he says "it's all you've got", I say "I know this, the situation just sucks", he replies "why are you yelling at me?", and I answer "I'm just frustrated, can't I complain about it?"  This happens at least once a month, same conversation, same situation.  It will never be resolved until years from now, many years, when I can afford to buy a new car.  I dream of that day.  Not having the fear that the car is going to die at any moment.  If I'm driving home late at night, I think "hope it doesn't die now".  If I'm heading home from work through the narrow moutain roads, I think "hope it doesn't die now".  You get what I'm saying.  I can't stop talking about the same things over and over, I need something new to talk about.  Unfortunately for anyone who's bored enough to read this, it's all I've got. Reagan

      So I had plans last night to hang out with guy from public make-out session 2004...until he had to cancel b/c he was recording.  After my previous freak out post, this made me breathe a sigh of relief.  Then...around 11 last night he calls to see what I'm doing...truth is, I wasn't doing anything, I was wide awake, and bored off my ass.  However, I made up some lame excuse to why I couldn't hang out.  20 minutes or so later, I call him with the old "what are you doing" when in fact, I know exactly what he's doing.  I mean, I had just talked to him.  Ridiculous.  Nevertheless...I pulled out the old "I was thinking about coming over" (slut) when, to my utter surprise, he rejected my proposal.  He said he was "tired" and suggested we just hang out this weekend. I have no idea what other people would have made of this situation, but I being the sick bastard I am, became turned on by his unavailability.  After watching Celebrity Poker all night, all I could think was "nice play".  I tried to bluff with my lame excuse for why I couldn't hang out, but in the end, I folded.  And now, I can't wait to see how the next hand plays out.  Game on.   Reagan

      Emily of good advice said:  "these are our "me" years...there's nothing wrong with wanting to be selfish with our time...it's not like we have kids to worry about or something" While Mike had something more poignant to say: "yeah, you need to chill...maybe you should smoke more pot" Thanks guys.  I rarely actually take advice (even though I ask for it all the time...I guess it's just an excuse to talk about myself), but I'll keep it in mind.

      So new casual Reagan isn't working out so well.  I can't stop thinking about this new guy and if I can actually date him and what's going to happen and what I should do about it and blah blah blah.  This is typical, many can attest to this, that I run at the first sign of someone being interested in me.  You'd think I just like the game, but I don't, I hate the game, I want things to be simple- I like you, you like me, bam, we're dating.  I literally feel like I'm having a panic attack at the thought of having to share my time with someone else other than my friends.  I don't know who I'm looking to fill this other 1/3 of my life (1/3 being friends, the other 1/3 being me time- work may take up a fraction of my life, but I won't give it credit).  I came to the realization that I'm an asshole.  I am.  I'm an amazing friend, and I'm bragging, but I honestly would take a bullet for my friends.  But I'm an asshole when it comes to guys because I will ditch you the second it gets too complicated for me.  And this is before anything even happens.  I'm talking about when I just can't take the thinking about whether or not you warrant a fraction of my time anymore.  Life's too short to worry about such bullsh*t, and this is what I tell myself when I stop returning your calls (or emails, as has happened before).  Yet the people I really try to go after, the ones I really want to see and talk to and spend time with...is it a coincidence they don't like me back?  Or am I just a masochist who likes this mental torture?  I'm f*cked up..I know this, you know this...but am I really different from everyone else out there?  I know of others like me, we need some kind of support group...or mood stabalizer.  I don't know, maybe I just need to drink more to loosen me up.  I'm like an old woman set in her ways.  If something has the potential to change my life in anyway, I freak the f*ck out.  Maybe I need therapy.  Maybe I just need to chill out.  Oy, this is all too much for one mind to comprehend.

      Last night I ran into one of my favorite people...the Camel complimentary cigarette man.  Brief interruption.... Okay, now, where was I.  When I was in Austin, I was so close with our Camel guy, we were the best of friends, I think his name was Ryan or something like that (okay, so not close enough).  I would see him across the room with his bag o' cigarettes and his ID scanner.  I'd motion him over, the crowd would part, he'd move over to me like he was floating on air and deliver to me two packs of free (or complimentary as the marketing guys like to call them) cigarettes.  I know, I know, smoking is bad, it's wrong, it's so wrong.  But I can't help myself...like many others I'm addicted.  And although I'm a quitter with most things I do in life, for some reason this isn't one of them.  Why is it so easy to give up the things we should do and so hard to stop the things we shouldn't?  Interesting query, Reagan.  You're so deep, your intellectual capacity astounds us all.  I'm so poor right now...it really is putting a damper on my social life.  I spent the last $12 in my checking account on two rum and cokes last night and they acted more as a sedative than a stimulant.  Maybe I should sell some of my things, though I have nothing of value.  Who needs money anyway...it disappears so quickly and I never have anything to show for it.  Ugh, I'm starting to annoy myself.  This is bad.   Reagan

      my friend had a brief experience with an ex-real world cast member (all names will be kept confidential- i'm no kiss and tell, esp when it's not my kissing i'm telling).  i told her not to go near reality whores...they're always out to hold on to their 15 mins of fame.  so she tells me he's leaving and jokingly i respond with "where's he going, real world/road rules challenge?"  at this point, i'm finding myself quite clever as i'm snickering at my desk.  turns out, that's exactly where he's going.  my whole point of what is actually a pointless posting is THIS...it's over real worlders/road rulers...you can't make money off your brief stint on MTV forever...get a real job!  or don't.  real jobs actually suck.  reagan

      I'm feeling kind of sexy after this weekend.  All it takes is two boys telling me I'm hot and I'm convinced.  This feeling won't last long, so I'm taking it all in while I can.  I feel myself strutting down the hallway at work, like a shorter/squattier version of a supermodel.  I'm not squatty, I don't want to put that out there in the universe.  This is my high right now, and I'm going to indulge in it.  So now I just want to go out and meet more people who will fall in love with me.  Or not..I'm getting ahead of myself.  So I've realized I always have to have a "thing".  Last week my thing was dieting (which I'm still doing...5 lbs gone- and I realized the sad fact that eventually I need to start working out but am not sure that will ever happen).  This week my "thing" is not thinking so much.  Meaning not overanalyzing everything and planning ahead and worrying myself into a state of panic.  I can still be a pseudo-intellectual, that type of thinking is okay.  "Things" I've done in the past were, for example, the "furthering my career" thing.  That didn't last long, I soon was back to being an oblivious assistant.  There was the "watch less TV" thing.  That lasted about 2 weeks.  You get what I'm saying.  I'm a quitter.  And soon I'll probably give up on this good self-esteem thing.  But for now, I will continue to strut down the hallway. Reagan

      I'm at this point where everything seems to be working out for me.  I've got great friends, I've been meeting some cool new people, I have someone to make out with...and now I'm just waiting for it all to come crashing down.  Not really.  I go through phases...it's the manic in me.  I'm up, I'm down, I'm up, I'm down.  I'm either whining about how everything sucks, or bragging about how everything is great.  I think you get the picture.  I've been talking too much about myself (and who wants to read that, really)...I need some celebrity gossip to discuss.  I'm kind of dry in that area at the moment- I haven't been keeping up.  If anyone out there hasn't seen VH1's "Best Week Ever" I suggest you check it out.  Funny as hell.  I have a crush on one of the Modern Humorist...the left one.  I can't keep up with names.  I also love, love, love Micheal Ian Black- his deadpan humor gets me every time.  He's the reason I watch the VH1 countdowns (I love the 80's...anyone? anyone?) and the best celebrity poker contestant.  I think we would have fun together...he would be funny and I would laugh.  When he shouted "You go to hell, David Copperfield" after his poker loss, I couldn't stop laughing.  In fact, I just laughed again thinking about it.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, then please disregard.  Now that I think about it, just disregard this entire post. Reagan

      This day has been the worst.  My computer is f'ing up so my boss has been trying to fix it all day, leaving me to stand around uncomforably with nothing to do.  Well, lots to do, just nowhere to do it.  When I tried to use another computer, all the windows started closing in rapid succession before I even touched the mouse...I think it's possessed.  So then I decided to just stare at the wall for a while.  I hate people today.  I feel like I'm going to lose it at any moment.  But I won't.  Because I need my job.  My car is making weird noises again, so I've begun fantasizing about beating the sh*t out of it with a sledge hammer.  At my friend's party on Saturday, love was in the air, as I found myself drunk and making out in the grass while other partygoers got their fill of my live version of soft porn.  Very soft porn.  I love my friends... several times throughout the night I heard cheers of "Reagan" and at those moments, I felt like I could do anything.  Now I just want more of that high.  But alas, I'm at work and couldn't feel any lower.  So ready to leave, so so ready to leave.  I wish I was drunk right now. Reagan

      So I went to the play last night.&nbsp; I like beginning sentences with "so"...then it doesn't seem to come out of nowhere.&nbsp; Yeah...so the play.&nbsp; The biggest problem I had with it was that it was all about body image, and girls hating their bodies, and so on....but all the actresses were skinny.&nbsp; Except one who wasn't fat but wasn't as skinny...she was the funny one.&nbsp; Aren't they (we) always?&nbsp; So as they're spouting off their monologues, all I can think is "You don't know what fat is!!!"&nbsp; And maybe that's the point, that everyone has f*cked up body issues no matter what size you are.&nbsp; But f*ck the point, the message, what have you....I don't want to see a girl who's a size 2 struggling to grab the skin from her stomach and call it "fat".&nbsp; If you want to have a contest, I'm game...b/c I'd kick your ass.&nbsp; Okay, so I do have a messed up view of my body.&nbsp; At least I'd like to think so, b/c that would mean I'm not really "squishy" as I like to say.&nbsp; More cushion for the pushion, it's not the size of the boat but the motion in the ocean...and many more sayings like that.&nbsp; I digress...I have to say the play was good, despite my previous complaints.&nbsp; But sometimes I don't like being bombarded with such female issues...it was such a vagina fest.&nbsp; Because when I watch from the outside, we (as in women) are pretty annoying.&nbsp; Very annoying.&nbsp; I know, I know, guys have their issues too, penis envy and what not...I'm done talking about this.&nbsp; I just realized I have no more to say.&nbsp; So I'll move on to latter portion of the evening...went for drinks with a few friends post play.&nbsp; It was just one of those good times where the conversation was so alive, in fact, there were several going on at once.&nbsp; When half our party stepped outside for a cigarette, the mood in the bar drastically changed- it was suddenly quite and seemed a little sad.&nbsp; So it was fun, good times, despite the weird guy hitting on Brianne and killing our conversation as he came out to await having, as he said, "the last drag of your cigarette".&nbsp; Guy, you ruined the mood and made us uncomfortable.&nbsp; You should practice your moves.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reagan

      So I have this new thing where I can't commit to doing anything, b/c in my mind, this will eliminate any kind of flaking on my part.&nbsp; This is f*cked up.&nbsp; It makes me seem like some kind of diva who just has too many options (not my intention).&nbsp; I end up being very vague, using words like "maybe" and "we'll see".&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality, I never have plans.&nbsp; When options do arise, it's after 3 weeks of social drought and everything falls on one night.&nbsp; Why does it always happen this way?&nbsp; I guess there are worse things in the world that can happen- like murder.&nbsp; Oh...that took a turn for the worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for this weekend, looks like&nbsp;I'm either going&nbsp;to Karoke&nbsp;in Culver&nbsp;City or&nbsp;drinking in Silverlake.&nbsp;&nbsp;I love Karoke, I do...but I have to be in the Karoke mood.&nbsp; Maybe the problem is that last time I&nbsp;"performed", at&nbsp;a bar called the Brass Monkey,&nbsp;&nbsp;I sang &nbsp;"Girl you know it's true"&nbsp;by Milli&nbsp;Vanilli after downing one too many rum and cokes....and the crowd looked at me like I was maming a small child.&nbsp; Sadly, this was the second time I had performed this song...first time was at the place in Culver City- a little neighborhood bar filled with sketchy locals + me and my friends.&nbsp; Of course, I suck at singing, I sound like a manitee being raped (whatever that sounds like...what's with the similes today?), but with Alisa, Ashley, and myself kicking it old school to the MV- well, let's just say best. performance. ever.&nbsp; Okay, the whole point of this is, maybe it's the bad experience last time that has scarred me from karoke- but hopefully not for life.&nbsp; Actually, the whole point was what I'm &nbsp;going to do Friday.&nbsp; You know, I can't make the decision now.&nbsp; To wrap this up, I'm ending where I started...indecisive and unable to commit.&nbsp; But at least I can't flake out.

      Last night I was sucked into watching Showbiz Moms & Dads and I've come to a conclusion...stage parents are crazy.  Well, not all of them, but of course the ones on this show are, it makes for good television.  There's this one family, the Nutters, and the dad forced the entire family (7 kids + one wife) to move to a 2 bedroom apt in NY.  AND he's forcing them to act.  Doesn't this count as child abuse?  I think it should, the kids are obviously miserable, the dad is crazy, and the mom looks like Allison Janney from "American Beauty".  I just don't think any one ever on reality tv has pissed me off so much as Mr. Nutter.  Okay, I need to get a life, it's official.  I'm going to see a friend of a friends play tonight titled "Bodytalk: Boobs, Butts, and Thighs" then going for drinks afterwards.  Hope it doesn't suck.  I have to get back to work...rarely will I ever say this. Reagan

      If you're like me, you have no idea what the title means (well, I didn't, but now I do).  This is malibu-speak for "dating a lot of good looking girls".  When Sarah wrote this to me, I thought it was a typo.  I thought I would share this discovery with others.  Another "so bad it's good" phrase was brought to me courtesy of Emily- it's the word "chillax"- I'm sure you can figure out its meaning.  I can't help using this word on occasion, many times in response to the question "what are you doing?" I answer with "chillaxing".  And I laugh to myself.  I don't mind laughing alone.  Another word Ms. Ems taught me was "ridonkulous" (sp?- but does it matter since it's not a real word).  For a period of time, everytime someone said the word "ridiculous" I would follow with this word.  It's like one level up from ridiculous.  And sure, I sounded like an idiot, but it made me realize how often people use the word ridiculous.  They use it a lot.  And this realization had no benefit whatsoever rather than useless information.  I'm fascinated by the way people talk- the way we're able to come up with what we want to say and it just happens so naturally.  We don't have to think about it (unless maybe we're trying to sound eloquent, but I'm referring to everyday conversation).  And how some people like to talk, others like to listen, some have the perfect balance of both abilities.  I'm more of a talker if you couldn't tell, and often I have nothing to say, really.  But I'm a good listener too.  I think, maybe. Reagan

      So, the writing thing I went to last night was...interesting.  I guess it just wasn't what I was expecting.  I thought it would be filled with people in their 20's, who all write like David Sedaris, and make witty, intellectual comments about each others work.  Not true...it was indeed 5 people- myself, Joe, a high school english teacher, and two old women.  Needless to say, I was skeptical.  Or maybe that's not needless to say, maybe I'm just prejudice against the elderly.  I decided to read a little of my "work"...meaning, random thoughts written down with no point, no direction- much like my blogs.  I just wanted to get an opinion of what I could do with my writing.  The HS teacher suggested I write an advice column and just use the questions as a format to go off on my own random tangents.  Nice, but I don't think I could really even give the initial advice.  He also said that I'm very self-involved.  If I wanted to lie, I would say I was shocked, but he pretty much hit the nail on the head.  I am, but I think that's completely typical for people at this stage in our lives.  Or I'm just making an excuse for my self-indulgent behavior.  Old woman to my left asked what I wanted to do with my life, to which I responded, "I'm undeclared".  Undeclared- it's freshman year all over again.  I feel lame admitting this, and I don't know why, but when I spoke at this alumni seminar, I had everyone laughing with my random (apparantly, everything is random about me) stories and quirky anecdotes and amusing mannerisms- and afterwards everyone telling me how funny I was.  And I loved the high I got from this- maybe it's the attention, maybe it's that boost of self-esteem I constantly crave, whatever it is, I just want to have that feeling for the rest of my life.  I just need to figure out how.  Reagan

      My friend sent me a link to this website that is selling "Save Mary Kate" t-shirts and bumper stickers.  They even have a mouse pad.  Is it wrong that I laugh at this?  I should feel no shame, that was the website's intention in the first place, to make sick people like myself laugh.  This would make more sense if I could remember the website.  I'm sure you get the point.  As I said earlier, I'm going to this creative non-fiction workshop tonight.  I'm relatively excited, should be interesting.  We'll see if I actually read anything of if I'll just act as a passive observer.  Aren't most observers passive by definition?  Why do I ask so many rhetorical questions?  Okay, I do believe time has stopped.  I looked at the clock an hour ago and it read "5:41" and I looked at it now..."5:43".  Seriously, an hour passed in two minutes.  It's something to do with the time-space continuum.  I finally tracked down my college friend Ty today...well, almost tracked down, I have his number and left a message on his answering machine.  It's weird that I spent 4 years seeing him pretty much every week (every day when he dated my roommate freshman year) and then nothing.  It was the saddest thing in the world to me that I didn't know what city he was living in, let alone if he was still in Texas.  When he calls back, we can catch up on the past 2 years then not talk again for another year after that.  That's the way it always goes, I've done the reconnect thing before, people.  How will I recount the past year- I moved to LA, got a job, have this whole new life...but after I give the summary, there's no point in going into minor stories.  He won't care about how drunk I was one night, or that a couple months ago I found myself at a bar talking to David from Roseanne.  So much significant stuff (not the David from Roseanne thing, other stuff) has happened to me in the past year and I could probably sum it up in a few sentences...I'm all about the broad strokes.  That's why I'm all about the email, I can type forever, but after talking for more than 15 minutes, my ear hurts from holding the phone and I gradually stop paying attention.  I start planning my exit- will it be another call?  time for dinner? an explosion outside my window?  Any excuse will do, just get me off that phone.  And this is why I can't keep in touch with people. Reagan

      After reading Bre's post today, I feel inspired.  It just had such a positive vibe in contrast to my incessant complaining.  And you know what Bre, you and Emily are "going places"...and I'm going to ride your coat tails all the way.  So, I am going to stop whining about every. little. thing.  Poor me, I don't know what I want to do with my life, I can't meet the kind of guy I want to meet, I'm a quitter...it's depressing, no?  So I'm going to talk about all the great things in my life.   1.  My friends- they are absolutely awesome.  Best people in the world, I love them all for so many different reasons.  I don't need to worry about no one coming to my funeral.  Side note:  I want some completely inappropriate song to play at my funeral, something like Britney Spears "Toxic"...or maybe something appropriate but completely dramatic, like "Come Sail Away" by Styx.  Moving on... 2.  I can't think about anything else at the moment...my friends are the basis for pretty much all of my happiness.  That sounds weird, I guess, but it's true.  There's nothing I love more than joking around with those crazy SOB's.   Yeah, so the list thing didn't work out.  I'm so manic, but a minute a go I was feeling so lost and now I realize that everything is okay.  It doesn't take much.  Reagan

      I don't know what I want to do with my life.  Am I supposed to at this point- I mean, I'm only 24.  But am I going to be saying the same thing years from now..."I'm only 28"..."I'm only 35"..."I'm only 83".  I need to be proactive, but I think I'm just too lazy, and maybe I should accept this fact and embrace it.  For a while, I was all about planning the next move in my "career" (I use this term loosely)...I was reading scripts, books, talking to people...I was on the ball.  And then it just stopped.  I'm such a quitter.  I always say I'm going to write...a book, a script, a story, anything- at least I'd be doing something creative, something more that watching tv or drinking.  I'm too critical of myself, if I write anything my first reaction is "it's brilliant!" immediately followed by "it sucks!"  I make too many excuses for everything.  There's always a reason for me not to do something.  Tonight I'm going to this creative non-fiction workshop (unless I make some excuse for why I can't go).  No, I'm going.  I need some kind of outlet.  I wanted to take an improv class, and maybe I will...unfortunately, they cost money, and that is probably the only legitimate excuse I have for not doing it.  The workshop tonight is free so I like it already.  Last night, I turned off the tv and opted to read instead after talking to my friend Skyler.  When she mentioned that she was reading "Fast Food Nation", it was like a light bulb came on-"Hey, I can read a book too!"  So I did.  And I liked it.  It made me feel slightly more productive, even if I was still just laying on my couch.     Reagan

      I just found out today that my favorite college hangout (think the Peach Pit, but with less color and no Brandon Walsh) has been destroyed due to a fire.  To this fire, I say this: "You son of a bitch".  I feel like a part of me has died.  Ashley suggested having a Cains Memorial Service- we would try to find a place that has dollar beer or at least one that's all wooden.  I know after the death of a loved one, it helps to remember the good times.  So here are a few Cain and Abel's memories I would like to share with everyone (they are vague mainly b/c they are fuzzy): 1.  All the times spent playing pool, esp. those special moments when it would be free for some reason. 2.  The many, many, many free drinks donated to us by Mike and Jason (I'll never forget you guys...never forget you)...and Ellis the owner, who though he tried to stop the free drink ring... well, that pissed me off, so I can only say he didn't completely suck. 3.  The moment when Cain's tried to enter the big leagues by expanding the outside area and adding a classy sign (yet still keeping the rope lighting around the fence) 4.  $1 beer, Tuesday nights- need I say more? 5.  All the drunken sex/making out that resulted from a long night at Cain's.  In my head, I toast you.   And those are just a few memories.  I probably made an ass of myself at Cain's more than at any other place ever.  And for this, I cry on the inside for this monumental loss.  Reagan

      I woke up late for work...I'm not talking 15 mins late, I woke up 15 mins AFTER the time I was supposed to have left for work.  I could understand if I had been up late the night before, but I had done absolutely nothing and gone to bed at 11.  I guess I just needed those 10 1/2 hours of sleep.  And at 2:51 in the afternoon, I have yet to fully wake up.  I'm v. excited b/c my best friend in the world is coming to visit on labor day weekend.  I must come up with fun stuff to do.  I must create the illusion that I'm living an exciting life.  This weekend, I continued my pattern of staying out/up late into the night and sleeping late into the day.  It leaves me feeling unfulfilled.  I want to be productive.  I want to have interesting stories to tell when asked the question "what did you do this weekend?"  I'm tired of answering with "not much."  How can I expand on something that was uneventful?  I should start making things up, that's always entertaining.  When I was little, I used to make up stories while I talked to my imaginary friends.  I think one's name was Gwendolyn.  That seems to ring a bell.  I would go out into our backyard and walk back and forth on this log while talking out loud to myself.  It sounds so sad.  I think I quit after I made "real" friends.  Sorry Gwendolyn, I never meant to hurt you.  I've started actually going to new places and when I think about it, I can't remember any places I used to go.  I always just hang out at various apts on the weekends, which I prefer to crowded clubs with $10 drinks.  My ideal is a place where the music is good, but not too loud, with somewhere I can sit, that's not too crowded, and with cheap drinks (but of course, this last request is hard to come by).  So that's what I'm looking for.  Always. I saw Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy yesterday and laughed my ass off.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes things that are funny.  So there you go, my sad version of a movie review.  Work has been slightly busy today, which pissed me off.  I wasn't ready for that.  I'm about to give some speedy updates:  diet not working, will not continue seeing boy from make-out session, car still sucks.  This is Reagan, signing off.

      These are the words Winona Ryder screamed into her cell phone while in a "trendy LA restuarant"&nbsp;bathroom.&nbsp; I wonder what the hell this "Ricky" (I say that as if it's allegedly his name) promised her.&nbsp; What's up Noni?&nbsp; What's going on?&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmmm...I wonder. Scenario 1: Winona:&nbsp; No no Ricky, you promised. Ricky: Why do you keep calling?&nbsp; I don't know who you are. Winona:&nbsp; It's me, Winona Ryder.&nbsp; Star of such films as "Autumn in New York" and "Lost Souls" Scenario 2: Winona:&nbsp; No no Ricky, you promised. Ricky:&nbsp; B*tch, I told you, I can't get you anymore illegal prescription drugs.&nbsp; I can't help you get high anymore!&nbsp; (This is a lame joke...about 6 months too late- why don't I just make a joke about shoplifting) Scenario 3: Winona:&nbsp; No no Ricky, you promised. Ricky:&nbsp; I'm sorry, but I'm going to sell this low budget porn movie you made when you were a struggling actress.&nbsp; I want to make the big bucks like Rick Solomon and that guy selling the Cameron Diaz S & M videos. This is the dumbest post ever.&nbsp; I don't know why I'm even about to hit the publish button.&nbsp; I should abort.&nbsp; Honestly, I just liked the title.&nbsp;  Reagan

      These examples were taken from the life of one of my high school friends who's such a f*ck up her actions often leave me speechless.&nbsp; To maintain her anonymity, I will call her CG.&nbsp; (Most likely you either know who she is or don't have a clue b/c you've never met her- there is no grey area) 1.&nbsp; Drop out of a prestigious university to attend&nbsp;community&nbsp;college.&nbsp; While in that community college, fail all your classes.&nbsp; Later, lie to everyone about attending college in preparation for nursing school, when you're actually just f*cking around. 2.&nbsp; Lie to all your friends about your sexual promiscuity.&nbsp; Tell them that the things people are saying about you are untrue, that you only mess around, but are&nbsp;saving the sex for marriage.&nbsp; So then they defend your name anytime it's dragged through the mud.&nbsp; In reality, you are f*cking anything that moves. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a secret drug habit.&nbsp; Find a circle of creepy friends who like to experiment.&nbsp; #2 and #3 can be combined- get high then have sex.&nbsp; It's fun! 4.&nbsp; Move to Nevada with your drug dealer boyfriend.&nbsp; When the people you're staying with kick you out, keep going west to California.&nbsp;&nbsp;Move back home when you&nbsp;run out of money/drugs.&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Get pregnant, but don't quit those partying ways.&nbsp; Because who doesn't love an unhealthy baby.&nbsp; Why don't you just ruin a child's life- you've already ruined your own...hey, you're two for two.&nbsp; I mean, I'm pro choice, but it's abortion or have the baby- don't try to kill it with alcohol, cigarettes, and excessive drug use. This may seem harsh, but frankly,&nbsp;I don't care anymore.&nbsp; There's only so much bullsh*t you can take from one person.&nbsp; Just when you think CG is ready to straighten the f*ck, she abandons you at the airport.&nbsp; Good ol' unreliable CG...the only thing you can rely on is that she will f*ck up again.&nbsp;  RW

      I always have such a great time when I go over to Alisa's for lunch- it just really beats the hell out of staying at the office and watching reruns of the Cosby Show in the conference room.&nbsp; Now, I think it's not even the Cosby Show, but just Cosby, where it's not even the Huxtables and Doug E. Doug plays their son or something like that.&nbsp; To this I say "no thank you."&nbsp; Today we talked about the fact that I need to get some action, some play, some whatever the hell you call it.&nbsp; I believe my exact words were "I need to get laid."&nbsp; I've said this before, but it always sounds funny to me b/c I don't think that I put out the vibe of being a slut or even very sexual for that matter.&nbsp; But I'm a woman, and I have needs.&nbsp; I'm so immature.&nbsp; I still laugh everytime I say "I want to do him" or&nbsp;any reference to "doing it."&nbsp; Why do I think this is hilarious, I don't know,&nbsp; I just go with it.&nbsp; I must warn any suitors- I don't think I'm&nbsp;really awesome&nbsp;at the sex, I'd say I'm mediocre at best.&nbsp; I don't know if I should so openly divulge that info.&nbsp; As my mom says, "Not everyone can be&nbsp;good at everything"- but I don't think&nbsp;she had this in mind.&nbsp; I've always thought of myself as a good kisser, until the last guy I kissed.&nbsp; We just didn't kiss well and it made me doubt myself.&nbsp; But now I'm convinced&nbsp;it was all him.&nbsp; I was always scared to put my tongue in there- it was like I was outside a lion's cage with a stick- I would barely put it in and he would attack,&nbsp;then I would retreat, wait a moment, then prepare to go in again, until after a few times I showed the lion I was&nbsp;his friend, he didn't have to bite me.&nbsp; By this&nbsp;point, I didn't want to play&nbsp;with the lion anymore.&nbsp; I'm so bad at metaphors, yet obsessed with them.&nbsp; I wish&nbsp;I could only speak in&nbsp;metaphors, like a little Dr. Phil.&nbsp; My Dr. Phil impression involves just making&nbsp;up sayings that don't make sense whatsoever..ex: &nbsp;"You can take a rat out of the cage but you can't stick a needle in a haystack."&nbsp; &nbsp;Huh?&nbsp; I never said I was good at impressions.&nbsp; I used to have a few bad impressions I really sucked at so much it was funny- Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Child, and a few others I can't remember.&nbsp; So bad, so bad.&nbsp; I also had a lame comedy routine I performed for my friends one night when we were drunk...I think it began with "So, that Micheal Jackson's weird, right?"&nbsp; What was I thinking?&nbsp;  Reagan

      Is it Friday yet?&nbsp; This morning I actually flipped off another driver.&nbsp; Gave them the finger, the bird as some say.&nbsp; Flipped off...I hate the way that sounds.&nbsp; Don't know why.&nbsp; I was waiting to turn right at a light on Fountain, and I just didn't feel like zipping into oncoming traffic, so I thought I'd just wait for it to turn green.&nbsp; However, b*tch in the car behind me was not pleased with this decision and decided to lay on her horn.&nbsp; It sounded as if she'd passed out and fell on it, like the sound after a car wreck- I should have gotten out to make sure she was okay.&nbsp; But she was, I could tell, b/c she was screaming at me inside her car.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; What's that you say?&nbsp; I can't hear you.&nbsp; (I shouldn't make fun, I have been known to do the muted screaming myself...quite often).&nbsp; So I decided it was appropriate to flip her off as I turned the corner.&nbsp; I have the most non-threatening middle finger in existence.&nbsp; Just doesn't convey the "f*ck you" that's intended.&nbsp; Okay, so she sped past me b/c she was in such a hurry- but as she zoomed around me, she got stuck behind a garbage truck and I just laughed and laughed and laughed all the way to the light.&nbsp; And then a little after I turned onto the next street.&nbsp; And just a little bit now.&nbsp; Seriously, I let out quite the maniacal laugh.&nbsp; Did I just spell that right, maniacal?&nbsp; Hmm...

      Old obsession made new again- Adrian Grenier.&nbsp; Watched Entourage last night, which I like, can't figure out why, don't know if I will after the next episode.&nbsp; &nbsp; Yeah, but Adrian- I want to do him.&nbsp; Big time.&nbsp;  I need to get a life. Word of the day: hate-fuck Definition:&nbsp; Unsure of exact meaning, it kind of speaks for itself Used in a sentence:&nbsp; I want to hate-fuck Paris Hilton *Ved, 2003 Reagan

      I have to apologize to Jake G...I'm sure you're going through a hard time and I was insensitive.&nbsp; I mean, you guys had a dog together.&nbsp; I just want you to know I'm here for you, as a shoulder to cry on or a rebound f*ck.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; I must let you all know, I have won passes to an advance screening of "Garden State" from indie 103.1.&nbsp; This makes me happy, b/c I never win anything.&nbsp; Maybe it's a sign that my luck is changing...or not.&nbsp; Does anyone out there know what movie preview plays an acoustic version of&nbsp;"Everlasting Love" by what sounds like U2?&nbsp; I can't get it out of my head, I seem to remember some movie preview that sucked at first then changed my mind once I heard this song.&nbsp; The power of music.&nbsp; Also, saw promo for a movie called "Dear Wendy"...everyone should watch out for this, looks amazing.&nbsp; Is it wrong that I think Jamie Bell is hot?&nbsp; Is he even legal yet?&nbsp; Do I even care?&nbsp; Sick.

      So frustrating, apparently the website was down, so I couldn't post the best news ever....are you ready....I'm sure if you're obsessed like me you already know...but....Kirsten D and Jake G are no longer.&nbsp; It's true, imdb doesn't lie.&nbsp; It's actually sad how excited this news made me, I actually said "woohoo".&nbsp; Not outloud, but over IM.&nbsp; Either way, that's a new low.&nbsp; So yeah for that news.&nbsp; And in other news, the poker party Ashley and I are having next Monday&nbsp;is having a bigger turn out than expected (orig. estimation- 5 people; new estimation- 15+&nbsp;people).&nbsp; Now obviously 15 people doesn't sound like a lot, but for one game of poker when we only have 200 chips (buying more chips is on our list of things to do) and a small apartment...it's going to be interesting.&nbsp; I guess we'll just have to kick people out of the game quickly and make them go to the losers lounge (aka the kitchen).&nbsp; No one joined in on my puke/not puke and that's okay- I'm not mad.&nbsp; I forgive you guys.&nbsp; But just remember, I'm bored off my ass at work, anything that can entertain me for 5 minutes helps.&nbsp; So I'm adding another installment...and here it is: Puke:&nbsp; Nip/Tuck (literally) Not puke:&nbsp; A new french film titled "Bob is not gay" (hilarious) Au revoir- Reagan

      I'm always trying to find new things to entertain myself at work.&nbsp; Anything to make the day drag a little less.&nbsp; I used to always do the crossword on yahoo first thing everyday until I realized that not only could I not finish one, but I never even got close.&nbsp; I don't need the yahoo game masters telling me I'm stupid (in their passive-agressive way).&nbsp; So I moved on....to learning French over the internet.&nbsp; I signed up on this website that would send me two emails a week with lessons in the language of love (that's French, right?).&nbsp; I did the first lesson...I think&nbsp;it was on verb usage or something like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I never did another lesson again.&nbsp; But I still get the emails.&nbsp; I hope Laura at aboutfrench.com isn't mad at me for being such a bad student.&nbsp; Or should I say,&nbsp;"Je ne&nbsp;suis pas l'etudiante&nbsp;bonne".&nbsp; Sounds good, no?&nbsp; Okay, so after my french lesson ended, I moved on to the blog to fill my time.&nbsp; And that it does as you can tell...I post like 3 times a day, would post more if it wouldn't make me seem so pathetic esp. since I'm technically talking to no one.&nbsp; You know it, I know it, blog=imaginary internet friend.&nbsp; Yeah...another thing I like to do to cure the cripling boredom is play on imdb.com.&nbsp; I'll look up an old movie, such as "Don't tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead" or "Rad" (just a few examples) to see what actors from those movies are up to now.&nbsp; Usually it's a few TV guest spots, a drug overdose here and there, or success (this is rare...Christina Applegate, count your blessings- well, I wouldn't have said that before- "The Sweetest Thing", "A View from the Top" &amp; other shit- but after "Anchorman" my opinion has changed).&nbsp; So where was I?&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, so now my new thing, it's not really anything having to do with entertaining me at work, but I've been looking&nbsp;for an improv class for Matt and&nbsp;myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;I need something else besides working (which I hate) or drinking (which I&nbsp;can't afford) or hanging&nbsp;around my apartment (which I do way too much).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FUCK..&nbsp; Had to let that out, I'm tired of answering the phones at work, I hate everyone.&nbsp; Everyone.&nbsp; I just wanted to sit at my desk for 10 goddamn minutes and the receptionist had to buzz me.&nbsp; 10 minutes.&nbsp; I'm leaving, I can't take this anymore.&nbsp;  Reagan That was really dramatic.&nbsp; I'll be back after lunch.

      I haven't taken my medication in almost a week...believe me, it's no "Garden State" experience...I'm not truly experiencing life for the first time..it's more like going through hell.&nbsp; So there you have it.&nbsp; I had a nervous breakdown/panic attack at the body shop this morning.&nbsp; There was crying, semi-convulsing, as people watched, shocked, unsure of what to do.&nbsp; I didn't care, at that point I just wanted to curl up on their sofa and go to sleep.&nbsp; This is unhealthy, so what if this&nbsp;is a "Prozac Nation" of overmedicated zombies...I needs my Zoloft.&nbsp; I can't function without it.&nbsp; See "body shop breakdown" if you need proof.&nbsp; There was also "McDonald's Drive-thru breakdown" this weekend.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I made Ashley a little uncomfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;My apologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know someday I should try life sans medication, don't know when that day will be, I&nbsp;always make&nbsp;excuses for why I need it.&nbsp; Just like a smoker.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't quit now, I'm stressed at work/life/etc."&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an excuses&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;girl, why should this be any different?&nbsp; Last night, I started thinking again about my life/future, what I want to do, what I should be doing differently, and instead of at that moment taking action, I read a book then fell asleep on the couch at 9:00.&nbsp; It was too much to think about so I gave up.&nbsp; I just want to keep floating on, where my worries involve what I want to do on the weekend, not what I want to do for the rest of my life.&nbsp; I whine, I complain, then I whine some more...but I don't do anything about it.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; Anyone know, b/c I have no f*cking clue.&nbsp;  Reagan

      Okay, I'm writing two posts in a row, but I'm sure my legions of fans out there are awaiting news of what I did this weekend.&nbsp; Well, wait no&nbsp;longer, it's that time...time for a little section&nbsp;I like to call "What I did this weekend."&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it's not&nbsp;a creative title. &nbsp; Anyway...let's start with Friday, shall we. Friday: Met up with some kids I hadn't seen in&nbsp;a while.&nbsp; I call them the "NBC Page Kids"...b/c they all were, and some still are, in the NBC Page Program.&nbsp; Another not so creative title, but it helps me identify them as a group.&nbsp; After hanging out and catching up, we started off for a bar down the street...until we found out how crowded it was and Ashley and I bailed.&nbsp; As I have said before, I have my 3 things I look for in a bar: 1) Not too crowded, 2)&nbsp;A place to sit, and 3) Drinks are relatively affordable.&nbsp; This bar went against all three of these requirements.&nbsp; So we quickly said our "see you laters" and were off to meet Jessica at the Red Lion.&nbsp; I had never been there before....and I liked it.&nbsp; We had a table outside (this is a bonus- outdoors=smoking=reagan happy even though she's sucking years off her life)&nbsp;and the drinks weren't too pricey and there was easy access to the bar, even though the beer maiden (she was dressed in Swedish garb) had a rather unpleasant expression on her face at all times making me feel like I was being a nuisance by ordering a drink.&nbsp; Didn't stop me though, just made me feel a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; With all I've written, Friday night was rather uneventful, even though it was good times had by all (meaning Ashley and myself). Saturday: Woke up bright and early to go to the beach with Alisa and Lisa.&nbsp; For the first time since I've been in LA, I went into the ocean.&nbsp; Normally I'm such a pussy and whine about how it's too cold.&nbsp; But Lisa had a boogie board for each of us and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to show off my boogie-ing skills.&nbsp; Or not...instead, I screamed "Oh shit" everytime a wave came crashing towards me.&nbsp; I later switched to screaming "Oh no" as I realized that children were around and I didn't want to poison their vocabularies with such vulgarities.&nbsp; Salt water stings, I knew this to be true, but had forgotten that blinding feeling.&nbsp; Didn't stop me from having a blast, even if I had my eyes closed majority of the time.&nbsp; Afterwards, we laid out so that we could become the golden brown you see in magazines (Paris Hilton, I will out -brown you yet!)&nbsp; Unfortunately, I burnt the f*ck out of my ass.&nbsp; Well, not my ass-ass, but the part right below it.&nbsp; Now everytime I sit, I feel a pain I've never felt before and one I can't describe.&nbsp; I've been continously applying aloe, something I've never had to use before, and trying anything I can to make the pain go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold compress, cold bath, lotion, aspirin,&nbsp;burn relief...you&nbsp;name it, I've applie it to my&nbsp;the area below my ass.&nbsp; It hurts like hell, but I keep laughing about it b/c it's making me walk funny (and the immature side of me finds this hilarious).&nbsp; So that was my Saturday. Sunday: Woke up in even more pain from the tragic beach experience.&nbsp; Laid around moaning while half laughing/crying.&nbsp; Afternoon not worth talking about- grocery shopping, laundry, stuff like that.&nbsp; The day really started when I went to play poker with some friends- alternating b/w Texas Hold 'em and Chicago style.&nbsp; I was so ready to try out my new poker skills learned from watching many hours of "Celebrity Poker Showdown" and prepare for the poker tournament Ashley and I planned for next Monday.&nbsp; However, it's really hard to buy the pot (my one poker "move")&nbsp;when you're playing with dimes and quarters.&nbsp; So that technique didn't work.&nbsp; And I've come to the realization that I have absolutely no luck.&nbsp; I've actually known this for a while, but when every hand I was dealt sucked royally (forgive the pun), it really drove this "no luck" theory home.&nbsp; So I lost $10.&nbsp; It wasn't losing money that bothered me, it was losing period.&nbsp; I'm very competitive.&nbsp; Side story: When I played tennis in high school, I was losing this match against&nbsp;a teammate (to decide ranking) and I screamed at her "I'm going to chop you up, put you in a bag, and send you to your mother!"&nbsp; I'm not lying- even worse, the girl I was playing against looked like she was 12 and even had a limp.&nbsp; I don't know why I would ever repeat that story, it just proves that I'm crazy/evil.&nbsp; Okay, back to what I was saying.&nbsp; Literally, I was pouting at the table b/c I was sucking so bad.&nbsp; Hopefully this will not be the case next Monday.&nbsp; It's my house people, I'm taking all your mother f*cking money.&nbsp; That was me talking shit, hardcore shit.&nbsp; Me actually saying that out loud would be really funny, with the Texas accent and all.&nbsp; You know, this post is way too long, way too boring, and a waste of everyone's time, including mine.

      This morning was the worst.&nbsp; I took my car to the shop so that they could fix whatever the hell is wrong with it...it's always funny when I have to describe the problem, b/c it's basically me making a bunch of weird noises as the mechanic looks at me like I'm crazy.&nbsp; I'm sure I'm not the first person to imitate an engine squeaking and convulsing.&nbsp; So...they call Enterprise to come pick me up so I can rent a car so I can get to work.&nbsp; But it takes them an hour to get there.&nbsp; So when I say (in my bitchy, what kind of service is this way) "sure took you a long time" his response is that the body shop was hard to find.&nbsp; We get in the car, and I'm not even kidding, not exaggerating whatsoever, go around the corner and we're at Enterprise.&nbsp; Took less than two minutes.&nbsp; Maybe the guy stopped to get ice cream?&nbsp; Maybe he likes to close his eyes when he drives, therefore being unable to see the rather large sign&nbsp;emblazoned&nbsp;atop&nbsp;the body shop?&nbsp; I don't know, but saying he got lost was not an excuse.&nbsp; No sir, it was not.&nbsp; Then...it took 45 mins just to get me a freakin' car.&nbsp; I was irate.&nbsp; And I'm not above acting like a bitch when I receive bad service.&nbsp; This can be embarrassing at times (to others, I enter psycho mode and don't give a f*ck) but after a while of Joe Slow-as-hell filling out the paperwork, I started quasi yelling about how I've been waiting a g-damn hour and a half and how I had to get to work.&nbsp; Next thing I know, I have my car.&nbsp; The lesson kids is this:&nbsp; Yelling and acting like a brat is a problem solving technique that can be applied to almost any situation.&nbsp;  Reagan

      So as I'm looking at the Garden State soundtrack on Amazon, I realize that Zach's girlfriend, Bonnie Sommerville, has a song on it.&nbsp; Bonnie freakin' Sommerville, aka Mona from Friends, aka Peter Gallagher's coworker on the OC.&nbsp; I can only assume the song sucks.&nbsp; Maybe I'm just jealous, b/c she's seen Zach naked.&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; I actually posted a comment on his blog for the movie.&nbsp;(Lame) Maybe he'll read it.&nbsp; Maybe he'll say, "this girl seems really cool" and he'll email me.&nbsp; We'll have&nbsp;an internet relationship at first, seeing as how he's so busy promoting the movie.&nbsp; I'm better over email than I am in person anyway.&nbsp; Plus, he needs time to call things off with Bonnie.&nbsp; He'll say to her, "It's not you, it's just that I met someone better."&nbsp; Then he'll come home to LA, we'll meet for the second time (after our encounter at Hotel Cafe a year ago), we'll start making out hard core in public (oh yeah, I'll meet him at the airport- I'll have a clever sign so he knows who I am), I'll move in with him, and we'll live happily ever after.&nbsp; In reality, this will never&nbsp;happen, you and I both know this.&nbsp; Especially if he ever reads this, I'm sure I'll automatically (and most likely deservedly) be labeled "stalker".&nbsp; Please, I'm&nbsp;too lazy to be a stalker.&nbsp; That involves research and following people and what not.&nbsp; I tried it once.&nbsp; When I was in high school, there was a rumor that Matthew McConaughey was in town (Longview, TX...never heard of it?&nbsp; not surprised)&nbsp;and he was driving a white van somewhere in this one&nbsp;neighborhood.&nbsp; So my girlfriends (as my grandmother would call them) and I went driving around looking for it.&nbsp; We&nbsp;found a white van, but I think it was the cable company.&nbsp; That could have been his cover, but we didn't check it out.&nbsp; Okay, moving on from this psycho babble...I just looked up the soundtrack for A Home at the End of the World and discovered that Duncan Sheik scored it.&nbsp; Duncan Sheik?&nbsp; I vaguely remember them/him (is it a guy or a band?&nbsp; probably a guy...nevermind).&nbsp; He had some song that was popular years ago that I've now forgotten.&nbsp; I just looked it up- it was called "Barely Breathing".&nbsp; I'm remembering mediocrity.&nbsp; But can't recall the tune.&nbsp;  Reagan

      Sometimes I wonder what happened to certain people I've known at one time or another in my life.&nbsp; Meaning: where are they now?&nbsp; And do they ever think, "Hey, I wonder what Reagan's up to these days?"&nbsp; Usually it's friends I've lost touch with from either high school or college.&nbsp; But then there are the random people I remember.&nbsp; Bobby Kahey.&nbsp; Does he still work as a cashier at Albertsons?&nbsp; B/c that's the last thing I remember him doing, so he must still be there, at that same check out line, with that same expression that I'm the last person he wanted to see.&nbsp; Probably b/c I made fun of him.&nbsp; Not directly, but I laughed when others did.&nbsp; They had to names for him.&nbsp; Blow-jobby Gay-hee (weird and yet clever in a way) and Skabi (b/c he loved Ska and talked about it way more than Ska should be talked about).&nbsp; We were 17/18ish at the time, and I think that's a little old to be calling someone names.&nbsp; But we were young, even if it didn't seem so at the time.&nbsp; Looking back, now I know.&nbsp; I also wonder about Cara Wonders.&nbsp; I heard many things after high school.&nbsp; 1) She was impregnated by this guy at another high school and tried to kill the baby by hitting a volleyball against her stomach.&nbsp; Isn't this the sickest rumor?&nbsp; Honestly, who came up with this?&nbsp; It's like all they knew about her was that she was on the volleyball team, so they used the only info they had&nbsp;to make up something horrible.&nbsp; 2) She went to college at an all girls school and became a lesbian.&nbsp; This could be true, it could happen.&nbsp; Very typical of the small town I grew up in, spread a rumor that someone's, don't say it, ho-mo-sex-ual, and it's the talk of the town.&nbsp; We only had two gay guys in our school that were actually "out" and they were both ridiculed, one worse than the other b/c he wasn't as flamboyant and therefore more of a target for teasing.&nbsp; Like he was hiding something.&nbsp; Like calling him "gay" was an insult.&nbsp; He was.&nbsp; Stop trying to turn a fact into a dirty word.&nbsp; I've recently reconnected with few friends from both high school and college.&nbsp; I just started thinking it was the saddest thing in the world that I used to know these people so well, see them every day, and now I don't know anything about their lives.&nbsp; And this happens all the time.&nbsp; Just because I've emailed or called them doesn't mean we're caught up and things are the way they used to be.&nbsp; Most likely, I won't call again.&nbsp; I have new people in my life.&nbsp; I can't hold onto everyone in my past.&nbsp; It's just weird to me, that's all.

      I literally just said, "It's all good."&nbsp; I'm not even kidding.&nbsp; A client apologized about her fax not working and that's when it came out.&nbsp; I almost wanted to correct myself.&nbsp; So the other night after "Garden State" as Ashley and I were leaving the Grove, I saw Brandon from "Blow Out" eating outside at this restuarant.&nbsp; Instead of just smiling at the fact that I saw a reality TV star (I use this term loosely), I pointed and semi-shouted, "Hey Ashley, it's Brandon."&nbsp; Then I just started laughing, astonished at my bravado.&nbsp; So Brandon, if you're out there, I apologize for bringing attention to you, I know you never wanted fame (a ha ha), you just want to cut hair.&nbsp; "I thought we were hair stylists, not tough guys"&nbsp; Okay...last night instead of going to meet my friend Thesy at&nbsp;Barney's Beanery, which I've promised to do every week and have flaked every time, I stayed home and wallowed in my own self pity.&nbsp; I would say it was depressing, but it kind of wasn't.&nbsp; I watched this week's Six Feet Under, which I missed on Sunday.&nbsp; Excellent as usual.&nbsp; Especially loved the scene when Clair and her friends started singing along to Death Cab.&nbsp; I want to recreate that. Then I took a bath and listened to Air's score from the Virgin Suicides.&nbsp; Whenever I'm stressed, I like to take a bath and hold my head underwater.&nbsp; Sounds a little weird, right?&nbsp; Try it, it works.&nbsp; Work is starting to get busy.&nbsp; I had to stay late last night and it pissed me off.&nbsp; And now I have more sh*t to do.&nbsp; I complain when it's dead, I complain when&nbsp;it's busy as hell, why can't there be a middle ground?

      So I just read that Target will be selling Kabbalah string.&nbsp; I blame this on Madonna.&nbsp; Now every celebrity and their f*cking dog is practicing Kabbalah.&nbsp; Or claiming to...all it takes is a little red string fashioned into a bracelet.&nbsp; This is like the WWJD fad of the mid-90's.&nbsp; What else can we make into a marketable product?&nbsp; Here are a few ideas (all based on the religion on which I was raised, Chrisitanity- feel free to offer ideas on Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc...anything that can make money and give you automatic religion street cred): 1.&nbsp; Bible belts: Yes, it's a play on the region in which I grew up.&nbsp; Anyone laughing?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Okay, I'm thinking, scriptures or names of prophets on leather, maybe with gold lamet lettering.&nbsp; It would be all the rage. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion tees:&nbsp; Someone already stole my "Jesus is my homeboy" idea.&nbsp; F*ckers.&nbsp; So now, I want to see some shirts with clips from this&nbsp;Mel Gibson opus.&nbsp; Who wouldn't love a Jesus on the cross tee?&nbsp; I'm going to hell, aren't I? 3.&nbsp; Cross skateboards:&nbsp; Sure, they would be hard to maneuver, but how awesome would you look&nbsp; trying to glide down a stair rail while keeping it real with the Lord.&nbsp; I sound like&nbsp;Pastor Skip&nbsp;in "Saved".&nbsp; He was cool.&nbsp; "Who's down with G-O-D?" Now I'm thinking about "Saved" and how hilarious it was.&nbsp; So out of pure boredom, I'm going to post a few of my favorite quotes.&nbsp; Enjoy.   urlLink Hilary Faye : Mary, turn away from Satan. Jesus, he loves you.   urlLink Mary : You don't know the first thing about love.   urlLink Hilary Faye : [Hilary Faye throws a Bible at Mary] I am *filled* with Christ's love!       urlLink Mary : [about the Virgin Mary] I know this is wrong, but do you ever wonder if she just made the whole thing up? I mean, it's a pretty good one. It's not like anyone can ever use virgin birth as an excuse again.       urlLink Tia : Sorry about Dean's faggotry.       urlLink Cassandra : What's the only reason a Christian girl comes downtown to the Planned Parenthood clinic?   urlLink Roland : To plant a pipe bomb?   urlLink Cassandra : Okay, two reasons.       urlLink Veronica : Roland is so blessed to have such a thoughtful sister. You know, in countries like China, Hilary Faye would probably have been killed at birth.  urlLink Hilary Faye : And then where would you be, Roland?   urlLink Roland : China.       urlLink Trudy Mason : Patrick has recently returned from South Africa where he worked as a missionary and just completed a world tour as part of the Christian Skateboarders Association.   urlLink Cassandra : Been hittin' the board for the Lord? God, is nothing sacred to you people?   &nbsp;  urlLink Hilary Faye : [at a shooting range] Us Christian girls have got to learn to protect ourselves. I mean, sure Jesus could restore my mental and spiritual virginity, especially if I lost it to some [cocks gun] rapist, but who wants that? I'm saving myself for marriage, and I'll use force if necessary.   &nbsp;

      I know there are a few of you awaiting my thoughts on Garden State.&nbsp; Here goes nothing (if you're expecting a movie review, this isn't it). I was nervous going into the movie, b/c I've built it up so much ever since I was aware of its conception, I thought I might be disappointed.&nbsp; It's kind of like when people meet me in person after hearing so many great and wonderful things- it's&nbsp;a bit of&nbsp;a let down.&nbsp; But enough about me.&nbsp; Garden State was fantastic!&nbsp; I absolutely loved it.&nbsp; The time has come that the rest of the world shall know the greatness that is Zack Braff.&nbsp; Well, they probably already do, but this just solidifies it.&nbsp; The best part about the movie is not necessarily the story, but the characters.&nbsp; Natalie Portman, who someone said peeked at 12 and I agree, was awesome.&nbsp; Now I can remove&nbsp;"Where the Heart is" and "Anywhere but Here"&nbsp;as films that come to mind when&nbsp;the name Natalie Portman is mentioned.&nbsp; And Peter Sarsgard.&nbsp; Oh Peter, you're just amazing in everything you do.&nbsp; Even this really weird movie I saw at SXSW&nbsp;whose name I can't remember.&nbsp; Something to do with you living&nbsp;with&nbsp;an agoraphobic woman and she suspects you're a murderer but&nbsp;you're actually a nice guy who helps her to face her fears.&nbsp; Anyway, I digress.&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie definitely had its&nbsp;overly sentimental moments, but&nbsp;I didn't care.&nbsp; I almost wanted to&nbsp;shed a tear in support of those moments b/c I liked the movie as a whole.&nbsp; It's one of those movies where I left the theater happy b/c I'd seen such a great movie and I&nbsp;couldn't wait to talk to Ashley about how much we loved it, but it also left me&nbsp;depressed b/c I'm not Natalie Portman, I didn't make out with Zach, and&nbsp;I'm unsure if I'll ever feel anything like the characters in the movie.&nbsp; Truth is, I do.&nbsp; I'm lost, confused, sad, happy, f*cked up- and many other things, but I don't have time to list them all.&nbsp; It's just not as glamorous b/c people aren't paying to watch me feel these&nbsp;things.&nbsp; I guess the biggest thing is I'm so hard up for someone to be really into me.&nbsp; B/c I know I'm constantly meeting people I find fascinating and want to spend as much time as possible getting to know (but that's a little bit of bullsh*t, b/c this usually ends after a week).&nbsp; I don't know what my point is, I guess I just want someone to feel so much for me and me to feel that way back.&nbsp; Completely mutual feelings of liking/caring/loving/what have you.&nbsp; I found myself completely enthralled by the oddities of Natalie Portman's character, and I thought to myself, "I'm weird like that".&nbsp; In a different way, but still weird.&nbsp; Now I just need a Zach Braff aka Andrew Largeman to find that fascinating, not strange.&nbsp; You know what though, I can talk in circles about what my "problem" is, but maybe in reality I just need to shut the f*ck up about it.&nbsp; I'm going to try that right now.

       I'm so bored right now I could gouge my eyes out.&nbsp; Wait, why would I want to do that?&nbsp; How would that make anything better?&nbsp; On top of the boredom, I ate too much at lunch and now just want to go to sleep.&nbsp; I wish napping wasn't so frowned upon at work.&nbsp; My boss just walked by with dog in a bag, but not one of those little purse dogs.&nbsp; A&nbsp;medium-sized dog.&nbsp; It made me laugh, and I'm still kind of laughing just thinking about it.&nbsp; It only happened two minutes ago, I'm sure I'll get over it soon enough.&nbsp; I'll find something else to laugh about.&nbsp; Ooooh, like the time Conan was doing the "what if they had a baby" bit on his show, and they had a picture of Leonardo DiCaprio and Giselle- obviously Conan had yet to see the picture, b/c he was taken aback by how much weight he'd gained, so he says, "I guess he's preparing for his next role in....A big fat fatty."&nbsp; And it was the way he said it that was the funniest, but I guess I'm writing this for Ashley and Emily b/c they know exactly what I'm talking about and can hear it in their heads right now.&nbsp; Sorry for the rest of you, but it's still funny, trust me.&nbsp;   Reagan

      Yes, this is the second time I've used this expression in too short of time.&nbsp; I don't know why I find it so amusing.&nbsp; So...poker party last night.&nbsp; I'm still upset over my loss.&nbsp; I did come in first place of the losers, so maybe that should count for something.&nbsp; Can't help but think what I could have done with the $50 in the pot.&nbsp; I could have paid my overdue college loan payment.&nbsp; Sallie Mae would have liked that.&nbsp; She's so nice, she always sends me little reminders telling me all the different ways I can pay my bill.&nbsp; I also could have paid my cell phone bill.&nbsp; Instead, I think I'll just wait until they call and threaten to cancel my service before I take action.&nbsp; I could have used it on groceries.&nbsp; But who needs groceries when you have a couple cans of tuna and a box of cereal?&nbsp; I was planning on starting this new diet where I don't eat anything, so it all works out.&nbsp; Even though I lost, I had a fun doing it.&nbsp; The game started out with 11 people and in the span of 3 hours wittled down to just Justin and myself.&nbsp; He had about $40, I had $10.&nbsp; My only chance was to try to double up.&nbsp; And I couldn't get a decent hand to save my life.&nbsp; So I just went all in on a pair of fours.&nbsp; And I was unsuccessful, b/c the a*hole got two aces.&nbsp; I didn't stand a chance.&nbsp; I think I might be dwelling on this a little too much, but what else do I have to think about?&nbsp; Work?&nbsp; I wonder what I would think about if it wasn't always about something that had pissed me off.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I would think about bunnies and babies and other happy things like that.&nbsp; Rainbows?&nbsp; I'm an idiot.&nbsp; Who comes up with sh*t like that?&nbsp; Tonight I'm going to see a sneak preview of Garden State...I couldn't be more excited.&nbsp; Well, unless that preview was followed by sweet love making b/w myself and Mr. Braff.&nbsp; Yeah....I'll report back tomorrow on how awesome it is.&nbsp;  Reagan

      I feel kind of weird, having written about the guy from Saturday.&nbsp; I'm used to just ranting about things that suck.&nbsp; Now that I put it out there that I like this guy, I feel like karma is going to kick my ass and f*ck things up for me.&nbsp; It likes to do that.&nbsp; I think it's maybe the karma that makes me manic.&nbsp; B/c it waits until things are going good, at this point really good, this month has been awesome, then it shows up at my door, "Hey, I'm here to f*ck up your life.&nbsp; It won't take long."&nbsp; I'm too dramatic, b/c honestly, my life is not bad.&nbsp; Extremely bad things don't happen to me.&nbsp; So what if maybe a guy I want to call doesn't- I don't cry over it.&nbsp; I can't even think of the last time I gave a sh*t.&nbsp; And if someone out there can, don't remind me.&nbsp; It's not worth remembering.&nbsp; At this point, I should just focus on worrying about what the hell I want to do with my life rather than wondering when some guy is going to call.&nbsp; I can't help it though- I obsess.&nbsp; It's what I do.&nbsp; I'd like to paint a pretty picture of it, but it's actually pretty annoying.&nbsp; And other than this moment right now in which I'm talking about it, for most of the time I keep it in my head.&nbsp; And it stays there, festering, ready to explode, with thoughts of a million different scenarios, a series of probabilities and likelihoods.&nbsp; All over a f*cking phone call.&nbsp; You know, maybe I shouldn't be saying any of this.&nbsp; I don't want to put that crazy vibe out there.&nbsp; Just think of it as me being neurotic, b/c that sounds cuter than crazy.&nbsp; I know I'm neurotic.&nbsp; I've embraced this fact.&nbsp; Actually, forget neurotic.&nbsp; Let's call it quirky.&nbsp; Yeah, quirky sounds good.&nbsp; It's something you would read about a funny actress who lacks the typical hollywood star looks of say, Kate Hudson.&nbsp; B/c frankly, Kate Hudson isn't funny.&nbsp; Julia Roberts isn't funny.&nbsp; Janeane Garafalo- now she's funny.&nbsp; Some might even say "quirky".

      Now where was I...oh yeah, Saturday night.&nbsp; So yes, I did get some action.&nbsp; So much for being a born again...though that was more from circumstance rather than my desire to lead a good christian life.&nbsp; One of my favorite things to do after a night of drunken fooling around is to wake up and&nbsp;talk.&nbsp; I'm always in the best mood at this point (probably b/c I'm no longer sexually frustrated). Nothing serious, not about "feelings" or anything like that, mainly joking around, but I love to lay in bed and talk.&nbsp; Love it, love it, love it.&nbsp; So that's what we did all day Sunday.&nbsp; Oh, it was great.&nbsp; Usually, I leave as soon as I wake up, I always want to get the hell out before they can think "how do I get her to leave".&nbsp; This is messed up, I sound like a slut.&nbsp; I probably would have left, but I didn't have my car.&nbsp; And I'm glad I didn't.&nbsp; He makes me laugh, and as my friends know, there's nothing I love more than a funny guy.&nbsp; It's a real turn on for me.&nbsp; Eventually, we willed ourselves to get out of bed and we went and had lunch.&nbsp; Now, I'm just waiting for him to call.&nbsp; Hoping that he actually will.&nbsp; I usually think I have good instincts as to whether a guy will call or not, and I have a good feeling at this point.&nbsp; So we shall see.&nbsp; I'll just try not to obsess.&nbsp; I'm in total girl mode, giddy w/ excitment and nervous as hell as to what will happen next.&nbsp; Stay tuned...

      So....the weekend.&nbsp; Oh, the weekend.&nbsp; I miss you already.&nbsp; Friday night, made it&nbsp;a double feature evening with Napoleon Dynamite (funny as hell) and A Home at the End of the World (great, wonderful, loved it).&nbsp; It was nice to catch up on some long overdue movie watching.&nbsp; Lately, my attention span has been shot and I can only concentrate on things in increments of 30 mins.&nbsp; Even when reading magazines, I just read the captions under the pictures- the articles are too overwhelming for me.&nbsp; I need to get over this.&nbsp; Saturday, went to the beach, but was sure to wear a cover up so as not to re-burn my now peeling lower lower posterior.&nbsp; Didn't go swimming, seeing as how the water was freezing ass.&nbsp; My friends from the east coast would disagree with this statement, but I'm from Texas- I need the water temp to be 70 + with no wind factor for me to consider doing anything more than dipping my feet in.&nbsp; So I just layed out, completely relaxed, wish I was back there right now.&nbsp; Aaahhh.... So, on to Saturday night.&nbsp; Mat's bday party.&nbsp; Had a blast.&nbsp; It was just one of those great nights where I liked everyone I met.&nbsp; No conversation sucked, there wasn't a moment where I thought to myself "How the hell can I get out of this?"&nbsp; Usually in those situations, it's either "I have to go to the bathroom" or "I need another drink"&nbsp; Two great, if not lame, excuses.&nbsp; I'm suddenly having a flashback to an extended conversation about the difference b/c a midget and a dwarf.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; And speaking of weird, around two in the morning, this kid who seemed to be about 14 showed up toting around a bottle of alchol, claiming to be with some guy named "Wilmer."&nbsp; I thought it was strange, but at this point I was so wasted I just went with it.&nbsp; I don't know who this "Wilmer" is or why he was hanging out with the little guy, but some questions are just left without answers.&nbsp; As the night wound down and&nbsp;the party thinned out, pairing off became inevitable.&nbsp; Let's be honest here- I went to the party planning to hook up.&nbsp; And hook up I did.&nbsp; It wasn't a difficult feat, guys+girls+alchol=sex or some variation of the act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shit, I actually have work to do.&nbsp; More on this later (I'm such a tease) Reagan

      Before I leave this evening, in 23 mins (fingers crossed), I wanted to tell all of you out there- yes, even you- to have a wonderful weekend.  I've gone past utter discontent and into a state of euphoria at the realization that I now only have 22 mins (in theory) until freedom.  I will glide out the door as if I'm walking on air and spread my arms open wide before leaping off the back steps, where I'll hit the ground running towards my piece of sh*t, bane of my existence car.  So I may not be able to "eat" anything this weekend other than what I can find hidden in the back corners of my pantry...I might not be able to "drink" anything alcoholic unless I use use that small bottle of rum my coworker brought me back from Puerto Villarta...but irregardless (is this a word or is it just "regardless"), I will enjoy myself, b/c I have set no expectations.  15 mins...and now I have work to do.  F*ck. Reagan

      I don't know what radio station the receptionist is listening to (it's coming through the phone!!!) but I hear Kimberly Locke's "8th World Wonder" about 5 times a day. That's 5 times too many. That's right Matt, I said it. In case you're wondering, she was a finalist on American Idol...I was addicted like the rest of the masses. But I won't take it any further than watching the show- I won't be buying a Clay Aiken CD...nobody can call me a "Claymate." Enough with that. I'm ready for this day to be over and for it to officially be the weekend. My plans: 1) Cary Brothers @ Hotel Cafe tonight 2) Beach or movie tomorrow (are your reading this Ashley?) 3) Abso-f*cking-lutely nothing on Sunday. I didn't get a break last weekend, what with the last minute trip to Vegas and all. Me staying in is also a result of me having no money. None. Zip. Zilch. I've said this before, but I really want to drive the point home that I'm broke, and not in my usual way meaning I just can't go all out. Netflix has brought me: Demonlover, City of God, and one more that hasn't arrived. My co-worker's neice just brought me a story to read...sure it had some grammar mistakes and some of it didn't make much sense, but I'm sure she'll improve in due time. *Note: She's 8. I wish I was 8...then I wouldn't be at work, I'd probably be playing somewhere, maybe alone, maybe with some other kids, who knows? But it would be a hell of a lot better than this. I talk a lot of sh*t about working, but I could have it a lot worse. I could be doing manual labor. I shudder at the thought.

      Ashley's post inspired what I'm about to write. I could have just written a comment, but I feel like I wanted to say more. In case you haven't read it, I'm going to sum up the topic as so: Happiness. There are moments in my life where I feel truly content with everything. I can remember them, which is strange b/c it never involved a big event as a landmark in my memory. One example that comes to mind- Thanksgiving break a few years agoa at my friend Katie's house. I had gone back to Longview even though my parents had moved to Austin and it was so great to see Katie, Emily, Derrick, Eric, and a few random others all together again. This hadn't been the case in a while. Instead of going out, we were all just sitting around making each other laugh until we cried. Nothing else mattered at that moment, our only purpose was to one up the previous person's statement with something even funnier until that one person said something completely ridiculous that ended the cycle. And if I remember correctly, some guy named John told a really long story that strived unsuccessfully to be funny, except that it made us laugh at how not funny it was. I remember this, but I wonder if at the time, I knew that I was happy, that I actually thought in my head, "I'm really happy right now". But now happiness scares the sh*t out of me. In my twisted mind, I think that it's an indicator that something bad is going to happen. Like whoever or whatever controls the universe is just setting me up. This makes me think of whenever I'm in car with a bunch of people and we're all laughing, maybe singing, but genuinely having a good time, it reminds me of the moment right before a car crash. Maybe it's afterschool specials that have conditioned me to think this way. As I see it right now, if I let myself completely inhabit any happy thoughts, I'm only setting myself up for disappointment. I'm sure this explains a lot. Why I can seem manic at times, b/c I'm constantly fighting feelings of satisfaction with feelings of meloncholy. I think that maybe I should just let myself completely feel whatever emotion comes naturally, to accept being in a good place, and not worry what might or might not happen. At least then I can take in a little of the pleasure of these positive feelings. What it comes down to is this: I need to chill the f*ck out. Reagan

      The day has barely started and I'm already bored.  10 am, 8 hours to go.  3 hours until lunch.  My normal morning routine (not involving any actual work I have to do) involves checking my email, reading blogs (you people are slacking, I want a new post first thing in the morning), writing in my blog (right now, I have nothing to say, as you can see), looking around at random websites (not so inspired to do that at the moment), then just sitting here IM'ing people, talking about absolutely nothing.  Every now and then I'll get in to a really interesting conversation, one where I don't want to stop talking and at a pivotal point I suddenly have work to do.  Today my friend J (to maintain his anonymity) was talking about how he hasn't had "the sex" in forever and I reply with "I hear you.  I go for months at a time...it sucks"...but in the wrong box.  Instead of replying to J, I sent it to a co-worker.  I wonder if he knows what I was referring to-is it obvious?  Hmmm...interesting.  It's like the other day when the receptionist accidently wrote to me this statement: "jesus saves and ryan kills". Followed by "oops" as if I didn't already realize this was a mistake.  I still need to ask her about that, I'm very curious.   Maybe I'll go do that right now. Reagan

      Mary Kay Letourneau is free!  Time for children to rejoice in the streets.  In college, my friends and I got together to watch the Lifetime movie w/ Penelope Ann Miller (Where do you go as an actress after Big Top Pee Wee?) and we inappropriately joked that the theme of our quasi-party should be "Come as your favorite pedophile".  No one dressed up.  Reagan

      While at my friend Jenny's house last night, I began perusing her copy of this weeks  US  (a treat for me, since I only buy  In Touch - it's cheaper and offers pretty much the same information).  In this said magazine, I came across an interview with Paris Hilton re: her breakup with Mr. Nick Carter.  Honestly, I could care less, but I read on anyway.  And this is what made me laugh out loud (LOL for you IM'ers)- she said that after she broke up with him (over the phone, mind you) she went to the Kabballah center and got a new bracelet.  What?  I'm confused.  Now I know all it takes to get a piece of red string is a trip to your nearest Target.  Or yarn store.  But the thought that she went to the center, told her sob story, and a group of people (this is how I imagine it) decreed that she deserved a new bracelet...well, this, this is weird.  Isn't it?  It's like instant salvation.  I don't know much about Kabballah, but is it a religion, a way of life, what?  I guess I just don't get the whole bracelet earning process.  And frankly, I doubt I'm going to look into it.  What if they suck me in?  I don't want to drink the kool-aid!  Okay, I'm done with that.  In other news, I didn't sleep well last night.  I was tossing and turning and about 5 in the morning, just decided to lay on my back and stare at the ceiling.  What was I thinking about?  I can't remember, but I bet it was profound, like pondering human existence or what I'll look like when I lose 5 more lbs or why fat free milk always seems to go bad quicker than 2 %.  I always wonder what other people think about.  Ashley and I asked that question (to each other) in regards to our landlord.  All she does is sweep our apt complex, all day, every day.  What's going on in that crazy head of hers?  Last night as I sat on the steps smoking a cigarette, I could feel her eyes piercing the back of my head with every flick of the ash.  As for me, I'm usually thinking about myself.  Well, something going on in my life.  I think that's normal, right?  If not, then I guess I'm just self-centered.  I'm almost 25, it's too late for me to change. Reagan

      Why am I so obsessed with posting sh*t? As soon as I have nothing to do at work, I turn to you, my sweet, sweet blog. You'll never leave me, right? I invited my friend Tim to come hang out at my apartment tonight, but somehow he didn't find this very appealing. Maybe it's the fact that I said, "I have no money, so the only thing we can do is sit at my apartment." I should have built it up or at least used a little inflection in my voice. "Let's hang out at my apartment!" That would have done the trick. I have "Total Eclipse of the Heart" on rotation in my head.  Turn around...   Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming 'round... I don't mind it so much. It's the Bonnie Tyler version, not that remake from the mid-90's.  I can't afford to go out and that depresses me.  Many of my plans are being affected by the fact that I'm broke. Like my plan to eat. I literally rationed soup last night, I told myself I couldn't eat the entire can, that I had to save some for tonight.  I should use this week to read the book Ashley and I chose for our first official book club. It's only official in the sense that I just called it official, we don't have a creed or emblem or anything fancy like that. The book is "You shall know our velocity" by Dave Eggers. I love this guy, loved HWOSG, as the cool kids call it. I also love his "And now a less informed opinion" articles in Spin. I remember when I read HWOSG, I had such a crush on him, I loved his writing style, I found him funny and endearing and loved that he could be such an a**hole. I just used "love" 4 times. That's sad, I obviously don't hold much value in the word. I need to start obsessing over real people, real in the sense that I actually know them. Or maybe not obsess at all. Reagan

      I wish I had money right now b/c I really want to go on a massive CD shopping spree.  Just buy anything I come across that I might like.  Right now, I really want: The Streets and the Garden State Soundtrack.  I'm all over Iron & Wine's cover of "Such Great Heights."  I'm playing it in my head right now.  It's nice.  I had a dream that I was hanging out with Ben Kweller, it was so realistic.  I woke up actually thinking we were friends.  For a second.  You know whose face I'm sick of...Lindsay Lohan.  As a friend said not so recently, "When did she become famous?"  Well, now it seems obvious since she's all over the place- crappy movies, magazines, MTV movie awards, Wilmer Valderamma's c*ck, etc.  But seriously, how did "Freaky Friday" and "Mean Girls" make her a superstar?  I think she's taken a note from Britney Spears on how to skyrocket your popularity- take a slutty picture for Rolling Stone.  Maybe the cover isn't that bad, but check out the inside pic.  "Hi, I'm going to push my boobs together so that more people can talk about the fact that I may or may not have gotten breast implants.  I'll still deny it and act clueless as to why people are obsessed with my boobs.  I just want to be a pedophile's wet dream- is that so wrong?"  I know what you're probably thinking- I'm jealous.  Well, f*ck yeah I'm jealous, so there, I won't deny it.  I just don't get her appeal- her movies suck and she's not that interesting.  The whole Lolita thing has been done before.  And "Mean Girls" wasn't funny.  You heard me, I said it.  This is pathetic.  I need to move on.  Here are the top 5 people I want to sleep with at the moment: 1) Jake G. (he's a permanent fixture on the list) 2) Zach Braff (shocker) 3) Adrian Grenier (as I've said, old obsession made new again) 4) Deigo Luna (I want to dirty dance in his havana nights...what?) 5) Johnny Depp (another permanent list-maker)  If anyone knows any of these people and think they might want to do it with me, let me know.  Tell them I'm really fun and I won't make them spoon me. Reagan

      So apparantly I need more to eat than a can of Ralph's brand lower calorie pears, b/c I'm freakin' starving right now.  I went searching through the office for something to eat, anything.  I found a jolly rancher.  And I ate it.  Didn't even suck really, just started biting into it.  Not a good idea, I'm sure dentists everywhere are cringing.  Then I found the holy grail of snacks...pretzels filled with peanut butter.  And I ate them all.  I'm not kidding, finished the damn container.  And didn't even throw it away.  I'm ready to leave this office and go home, where Ashley and I will then hike Runyan Canyon in an attempt to a) get physical and b) possibly see Jake G. who has been spotted there a number of times around 730 in the evening.  I swear, I'm not a stalker.  Stalker's are much more motivated, we've been over this.  As you can probably tell, I'm in a much better mood now.  Don't know what changed.  Maybe it was Emily saying something funny about someone I'm not too fond of so that I could laugh at their expense.  I think that's what started it.  R.

      I can't handle phone calls today.  I'm being such a b*tch.  I don't feel like small talk.  Tell me what you want/need and let's be done with it.  I want to scream/cry.  Like this scene in Garden State.  It seems so therapeutic.  I'm not exactly sure of the reason for these feelings.  Some ideas: 1) Exhaustion from the weekend and an extreme lack of desire to be at work right now 2) Disappoinment in my handling of a certain situation I'd rather not go into right now.  Actually, I will go into it (that didn't take long).  I've never been the type of person who does the hook up thing then expects a phone call.  I know how it works.  But I hooked up.  And waited for the phone call.  And am now disappointed by the end result.  It makes me question the kind of person I'm turning into.  I don't think I like it.  I'm feeling bitter.  It's a waste of energy to feel this way.  I don't want to talk to anyone right now.  The sound of people in my office conversing is killing me.  Laughter is like someone hooking up electric shocks to my nipples.  I just made myself laugh, that's good.  How can I be bitter while smiling?  Wait, wasn't that what I'm trying to avoid?  Oy, confusion.  I'm in a funk and I need to get out of it.  I'm only eating a can of pears for lunch.  The reasoning behind this is two-fold: 1) I'm out of food 2) I need to detox from all the crap I ate this weekend (buffet...need I say more?).  Someone just asked me to fax something.  I don't want to do it.  I don't want to move.  I want to close my eyes and drift away.  Only 20 minutes until lunch.  Maybe the second half of the day won't suck as much. Reagan

      Cont'd. 3.  Even though I initially had a little luck with the gambling (turning $10 into $20 is like water into wine- for me, it's that much of a miracle), my luck ended abruptly when my flip flop broke on our way to the strip (after our 5 hour nap to reinvigorate ourselves).  I loved those flip flops, they'd been my favorite pair of shoes for the past 4 years.  I actually could cry over them right now, but I won't.  Be strong Reagan!  Sometimes I need a little encouragement, even if it's from myself.  So, I ended up wearing Guiseppe's Adidas slides the rest of the trip.  Are those things supposed to be comfortable, with the little pokey things on the bottom?  What's their purpose- I don't get it.  Instead of buying a new pair of shoes, I suffered through the pain w/ a lot of complaining.  A lot.  But like hell I was going to buy new shoes.  I only had $15, I wasn't wasting it on a pair of gaudy flip flops from a gift shop.  4.  On Sunday, we ate lunch at a place in Hard Rock and afterwards decided to do some last minute gambling.  After I lost my last $6 on a stupid poker machine, I decided to pulse out $20, just to play a little more.  "I won't lose more that $10" I thought.  I won't let that happen.  So I went to the same machine I'd played the day before (where again I turned $10 into $20...damn, I'm good) and put in my $20.  I hit a button and all of the sudden, I'd bet all of my money on one hand.  Black Jack.  And I lost.  All of it.  In two seconds.  I almost cried.  For those of you who know the truth, there was no "almost" about it.  I'm still pissed.  5.  When Alisa quickly packed a suitcase for the trip, she grabbed 6 pair of underwear for a one day trip.  This is what a drunk person thinks about while packing.  Amusing.  She also luckily got deodarant (important) and some extra tops (very important seeing as how the one I was wearing reeked of cigarettes and general nastiness). This is all I can remember about the trip right now.  Probably all that's worth mentioning.  And I don't feel like writing anymore.  This was a waste of time, it doesn't sound very interesting in writing. Reagan

      At 4 in the morning on Saturday, Alisa, Mike, Lisa, Guiseppe, and myself decided to head to Vegas.  Was alcohol involved in this decision, you wonder?  Why yes, indeed it was.  Copious amounts of alcohol, to be a little more descriptive.  And to allow me to use the word "copious".  B/c I don't want to torture anyone with a long detailed account of the weekend, I decided to provide you with a few highlights from this impromptu trip (in no particular order) 1.  At our hotel, they were having what I initially thought was a video game convention by the look of the attendees and it's title, "Defcon."  Was actually a computer convention, which I discovered after chatting up this guy sitting next to me on the couch while I awaited entrance into our suite.  Scariest sight:  One of the goth nerds, a woman just under 200 lbs, was by the pool wearing a thong bathing suit fashioned like a spider web.  After seeing this, I proclaimed, "I've gone temporarily blind."  I wasn't kidding. 2.  After finding a hotel, we went to the Sahara for their cheap tables and a little breakfast.  One word:  ham-steak (Is that one word?  I used a dash?)  Another word:  disgusting.   I however opted for the omelette, which was borderline inedible, key word being borderline b/c I still ate the entire thing- what can I say, I was hungover and starving, at this point I would have eaten cardboard.  After breakfast, we played a little black jack...where I doubled my money.  Sure, I doubled it from $10 to $20, but hey, I'm typically an unlucky person and it payed for my breakfast.  F*ck.  I'm tired and now I'm busy.  The list will continue...do not worry, my little friends. Reagan

      If you haven't seen the cover of  People  this week, I highly recommend you check it out. This was my reaction as I casually passed by it in the grocery store: "Oh. My. God." The cover is a picture of Britney Spears, her fiance, and his daughter. I have never seen a more unnatural looking picture in my life. I'm not even kidding, I'm going to frame it. Britney looks so uncomfortable as she's leaning in towards the little girl, who's eyes have the expression of a deer in headlights (I know, I just made fun of a 2 yr old). She wouldn't be so scared if she knew all the cool things her new mommy will buy her...well, at least for the 6 mos she's married to daddy (that's a generous estimation of their wedded bliss). Anyway, it really amused the f*ck out of me...hope you get a kick out of it as well.  urlLink http://people.aol.com/people/mag/0,19935,,00.html  Reagan

      Check it out people.   urlLink www.hottigotti.com   Hilarious.  As a certain someone said (you know who you are) in reference to John (middle son and author of the title quote), "he's the cutest...it's our little joke!"  Who said I was joking?  Mobster-in-training or not, I think we could really have something here.  Call me when you're 18. Reagan

      According to the Weekly World News website, Bill Clinton has set his sights on the Olsen twins.  In the best fake quote ever, an anonymous friend (shocker) claimed that after their 18th birthday, Clinton said, 'O.K., it's time to get jiggy with them!'  But wait....there's more.  Also, according to his friend (same one? or another anonymous source?  How many people know about this???), Clinton told him, 'Since they're actresses, I want them to help me act out my Twin Cheerleaders and The Lumberjack fantasies.'  Lumberjack fantasies?  Apparantly, you can take the boy out of Arkansas, but you can't take the Arkansas out of the boy.  And his explanation for his Olsen obsession: 'I can't help it. I've got Olsen Fever!'  You and me both, my friend.  You and me both.  Of course, mine has more to do with jealousy and intrigue rather than wanting to make them part of my twin cheerleader fantasy (in mine, the cheerleaders die in a tragic pyramid accident).  But that's neither here nor there.  I just want Bill (we're close, I can call him by his first name) to know, that he's not alone.  There are many other older men out there who want to screw the Olsen twins. Reagan

      There's no need for me to even write about what I did last night...just refer to my post from yesterday. Being completely broke really limits your social options, as I have learned. This will all change on Friday and for one blissful weekend, I will live like I am made of money. Then on Monday, the whole broke thing will start all over again. This is how I do it. No one in the office has made coffee yet...sure, I could do it myself...or I could just wait for someone else to do it. We have so much junk food in the kitchen right now: candy, popcorn (covered in chocolate, to make it extra fatty and extra good), mini muffins, pie, donuts, cookies...and the list goes on.  It takes all the willpower I can muster to avoid binge eating the whole lot.  I love when my boss is rude to me for no goddamn reason.  It really makes me feel like working my a** off.  I had a dream last night that I went off on her...I asked her why she feels the need to take this b*tchy tone with me all the time.  Sadly, I need this job to pay the rent so I'm stuck just taking it.  I feel like I have to swallow my pride every day.  Luckily, I don't think I had that much when I started this job.  Will it ever get better?  I can't forsee a day when I won't have to deal with this bullsh*t.  I think I'm in the wrong business. Reagan

      I read this article about rejection in "Self" as I was blow-drying my hair this morning.  B/c my hair is so thick, I get bored, so I read.  Just turn my head upside down and let the dryer do it's magic.  Okay, back to topic at hand.  Basically, it talked about how fear of rejection can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I have heard this before from numerous friends, to which my reply has always "bullsh*t".  Maybe I've been wrong all this time.  I mean, if "Self" says it's so, then it must be so.  If anything, I shouldn't be putting such negative thoughts out into the universe.  But then, what would I talk about?  I've decided to conquer these issues with a new mantra...or maybe a theme song.  Something power ballad-ish.  Nothing pumps me up more than a little song called "Open Arms."  Thanks Journey for making singing with your eyes closed a little bit cooler. Reagan

      Last night I layed around in the dark...alone...watching a movie. Sounds normal enough, right? It was actually v. depressing. Maybe I should have kept the lights on. I also think the movie had a bit to do with that...it was called "Levity" and it was just really f*cking grim. Dark colors, slow pacing, themes of redemption and forgiveness. Not really a "lift your spirits" type of film. Even though I was ready to pass out at 8, I kept on trucking, watching a series of bad television shows. Funniest moment of the night: Ashley and I were talking after she got home from work and I had left TBS on after watching an edited version of "Sex and the City" and we start watching the very end of "Outback Jack"- the moment where he chooses who he loves most. Or who he'd most like to bone repeatedly.  Did I just say bone?  Anyway, he rejects one girl, who then tries with all her might to look upset, but being the kind of actress that would do reality TV, she's not that convincing.  Then it cuts to him with the winner.  They say some things to each other, probably something like "I never thought I could fall in love with someone in a month while I was dating 20 other women at the same time.  It really helped that you have the body of a porn star."  Then they walk down the beach towards the water...into the sunset...ready to start their life together.  Okay, here's the amusing thing- as the camera pans out, it shows that the other girl, the "loser" if you will, standing right there, watching them walk away, still trying to force a tear out.  To this, Ashley quipped "She probably heard their whole conversation, she was just on the other side of the rock."  Somehow this isn't as funny as it was last night and it's pretty much what I built up this entire story to say, so sorry if it's disappointing.  But it made me laugh.  A lot.  When I got home last night, there was an envelope which read "New key for rubbish can."  Rubbish?  Really?  B/c last I remember my landlord wasn't British.  The word is garbage- don't try to spice it up with your fancy lingo.  Okay, enough of this nonsense. Reagan

      No matter how busy I've been today, no matter how much sh*t I've had to do, I still make time for my head to wonder/wander about things in my personal life.  I let it roam out of control, creating the most paranoid assumptions for why something did or did not happen.  I may call it paranoia, but I really think it's insight into how people really are.  I'm just that intuitive.  Or f*cked up.  I'm ready for this day to end.  Hmmm...what will I do this fine evening?  I guess I could work on planning my future.  It's time for another one of those phases, it's been at least 2 weeks, right?  Maybe I could make a 5 year plan?  God, I don't know what I'll be doing next week, much lesss in 5 years.  Out of boredom and not wanting to do any more work, here's a few questions I need to ask myself in order to get a jump start on the road to success: 1)  Will my resume stand out above the rest?  Hasn't been updated in ages.  It's still that fresh out of college version, in which I used the thesaurus to replace every word with something even better to the point that my job at McDonald's (unfortunately, it's true) sounded like a position at the UN. 2)  What do I want to do (career-wise) with my life?  How can I look for a new job if I don't know what I'm looking for?  I want to work in entertainment (like the other 99% of the poplulation in LA...I'm such a cliche), but I don't want to work in an ego-based environment...can these two things be mutually exclusive? 3)  How many kids do I want to have and when do I want to have them?  These are very important questions.  Do I want 2?  4?  10?  Do I want them now or when I'm 35?  Girls, boys, or both?  Names...oh f*ck, names!!!  How can I do anything without making these decisions right now? 4)  When do I want to get married?  Maybe this should come before the kid question.  I'll love the little tykes, even if they are all bastards.  But I'm not sure if marriage is for me.  I have an irrational fear of divorce...irrational b/c my parents and most of my friends parents are still together.  I just can't imagine spending the rest of my life with anyone I've met thus far in my life.  Maybe I should start settling for someone soon...before I'm a pathetic singleton mixing with the smug marrieds. 5)  When do I want to retire?  If I want to plan for a healthy financial future, I need to think about this.  RIGHT NOW!  Should I open a Roth IRA?  Can I even do that with my credit?  Wait, do I even know what a Roth IRA is?  If I keep smoking, will I even live past my retirement...and what about the children? Okay, so there you go, my life plan in 5 steps.  Now all I need is 5 answers.  I'll have to get back to you.

      This woman keeps calling and bugging the sh*t out of me.  I actually had to take a tone with her.  And you don't want that from me.  No sir/ma'am... you do not.  My "tone" will make you feel like less than a person.  It's like a forceful gust of wind that will knock the phone right out of your hand.  F*ck.  While I was typing this, two more people called and pissed me off.  I hate you all.  I'm going to talk about something else now.  Last night I had the saddest of all dinners...crackers.  I think they feed you better in prison.  At least there you get a tray sectioned off with different food groups (actually all that comes to mind is mashed potatoes).  I think...I only know from the movies, not personal experience.  Today I have $1 which I will use to get a Subway sandwich, thanks to their little stamp system.  I have completely filled out a card...now I only have to purchase a drink to reap the benefits.  Time has stopped.  It's been 10:40 for the past 10 minutes.  I look forward to the days when I don't have to work, like when I'm 80.  And probably in a retirement home.  And complaining about how my kids don't come visit me.  Those little bastards, I gave them everything!  That's okay, I'll just talk to other people's kids.  That's a depressing thought.  FYI...the title is my new favorite quote, c/o Emily who stole it from someone else.  I like things that rhyme.  I don't really know what context I can use this in...I guess maybe if I wanted to kick someon's a**.  Please, I'm about as tough as a Furbie.  We all know I'd use Ashley for self defense purposes...she's 5'2" of pure fury.  Espcially when she invokes the dragon. Reagan

      It's time for my stalker post of the week/day/hour, etc.  Here's the topic:  Zach Braff & Natalie Portman.  And the question:  Is it true?  Are they dating?  My heart breaks a little b/c if he's with Bonnie Sommerville, it's like I still have a chance.  B/c she's just a TV guest star glorified by a relationship with the love of my life (or of the moment).  But Natalie Portman...I mean, it's f*cking Queen Amidala.  No matter how much the movies suck, she's still a Queen, she still had her white jumpsuite onesie ripped into a Britney Spears-esque outfit during a penultimate battle sequence, causing my friend Walter to cheer a little bit.  And me to let out a "Are you kidding me?" to the aggressive shushing of the dedicated fan filled audience.  Okay, went off on a bit of a tangent...basically what it comes down to is Portman trumps Sommerville.  Always.  And where does that leave me? Reagan

      I did what I had planned to do this weekend- nothing.  Well, I did see Cary Brothers on Friday, then we went to the Cat & Fiddle afterwards, where I proceeded to get crazy drunk.  But not in the making a scene sort of intoxicated, more in the having an extremely long conversations about nothing sort of alcohol induced quasi-rant.  Good times.  Saturday I did nothing, b/c that's what I had planned to do and b/c I was super hungover.  I was only exposed to sunlight when I went to get food...or when my blinds blew open due to a sudden gust of wind.  I did watch "City of God" that night...which I loved.  So that made me feel a little sense of accomplishment, actually watching one of my Netflix orders.  Sunday, I played housewife, as Ashley worked and I did our laundry (4 loads...and there's still more to be done) and cleaned the apt.  So I spent my day watching Celebrity Blackjack until Six Feet Under, then became addicted to a new show, Growing up Gotti.  Why do I love these reality shows?  Why!!!  I'm so ashamed.  I'm actually hanging my head down in disappointment as I type.  This show, about Victoria Gotti and her 3 sons, isn't even that great.  It's just the boys fighting and acting like little goombah's (sp?) while Victoria talks about how hard it is to be a single mom through a voice over.  But I watched it, like the sucker I am.  I can't wait until next weekend when I have money.  Though I enjoyed being a lazy a**....it made coming back to work more depressing than usual.  I need more coffee.  Reagan
