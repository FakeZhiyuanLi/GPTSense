        Class Notes :  6/21/04   -Group presentations    Entry #15  :  Today we did group presentations of what our thoughts were on why anybody should read untrue stories.  The section I chose to talk about was that reading untrue stories promote the exploration of self.  Reading stories help you discover self because it sets you in a different world- an imaginative world- where you contemplate how that world and its things relate to you.  During this process is when you discover things about yourself and then you can begin to imagine what you want to behold.  As I mentioned before, in an abstract world, something different can be taken from the same story to help fulfill different people.  Extracting from something you read that you find interesting will help what you’ve learned stick to you better, rather than having someone preach it to you.  Becoming lucid in life also helps you realize what role you are playing in your own story.  Seeing this will help you understand how to play your role better, so that you can prevent mishaps and seek better fortunes.

        Class Notes :  6/18/04   -Energy never dies; it just gets transformed into other things   (Shakespeare and Nabokov)    Entry #14  :  The concept that both Nabokov and Shakespeare reinforce is that energy never dies, but it transforms into something else of energy.  I also agree with this mentality.  Isaac Newton proved that energy continues and never dies (lives on), so from knowing that, we are all a mass of abundant energy and how can our energy that was created virtually disappear?  Of course I don’t know what this energy lives on to be, but the notion that it lives on, I think, is what we all feel is part of us.  Not being religious, I still don’t understand how Atheist mentality (not trying to offend anyone) sticks to someone so rigidly.  I find that even not belonging to a religion, there are moments where I catch myself resorting to ask for guidance or intervention from something that I feel is out of my power.  I’m sure that if I was ever in a life or death situation, I would find myself praying as hard as I could for something else of a higher power to intervene and help me.  This is not to say that I believe in a conventional “God”, but that I feel that there is something more to us than just a makeup of organic mass.  Animals have a sixth sense, which I guess you can call their instincts, so why wouldn’t we?  I think that it is just our reasoning that gets in the way that we just deny those things, like when we feel like something just isn’t right but we use our heads to drive away from that type of reasoning.  I think it’s the trafficking of energy that we don’t see, but that we definitely feel and they affect each other, therefore affecting ourselves.

        Class Notes :  6/16/04   -“Blooms day” –everyday we live is adventurous if we have an imagination that is educated to experience it. -Everything will be lost if not written down – our job is to create moments    Entry #13  :  I think the mentality that everyday we live is an adventure, goes along with realizing that you live your life in a story.  As we discussed in class before, it is always good to realize which story you are in.  When you realize that the point of hearing stories, true or untrue, is so that you can get bits and pieces of the bigger whole, you have enough knowledge to understand what role you are playing in your own life.  In realizing this, you also see that your days are meant to be adventurous, such as in the stories that you read.  This will help you live your life to the fullest, how it is meant to be lived, which is what reading untrue stories help your imagination to do.  It is important to keep record or journals of what is done, because the day can only stay in memory for so long, and then it will diminish and there will be nothing left to cherish about that one meaningful day.  Just writing something down creates moments, that when read over again, brings your senses right back to what you were trying to preserve.  This is done in art, music, and poetry.  John Shade does this by writing his poem for the love of his wife and death of his daughter.

        Class Notes :  6/14/04   -The Tempest -Importance of stories- more you know, freer you are to move around in the world    Entry #12  :  “The Tempest” is the first Shakespeare play I’ve ever read, or had to pay attention to.  The type of English used is hard for me to read because it doesn’t flow as well in my mind.  I found that it was much more enjoyable, entertaining, and humorous to follow when read aloud by Dr. Sexson.  It is probably just my inexperience in Shakespearean literature, but I can’t really imagine why it would be more enjoyable to read as a novel rather than witnessing people animate the poetic language.    I thought it was interesting when Dr. Sexson mentioned in class that the more stories you know, the freer you are to move around in the world.  It was well put how he mentioned that we are all in a story of our own, and nothing’s worse than somebody not knowing that they are in a story.  I believe that we have heard all the stories by this age.  Even if you haven’t heard many, I think that intertextuality exists so much in every story that you can extract numerous lessons from them.  Stories put you in an abstract world where anybody can take something different from the same story to help fulfill different needs for each person.  This is a deeper and more meaningful way to discover, rather than having somebody teach you a lesson.

        Class Notes :  6/11/04   -Finish thoughts on “Pale Fire”    Entry #11  :  After finishing “Pale Fire”, it seemed to me that Gradus, Kinbote, and the King of Zembla are all the same people.  Gradus and Kinbote may be two personalities of Charles Kinbote that are disputing, because they are completely opposites.  Kinbote is obviously delusional and the fine details that he knows of both people are likely to be imaginary, therefore I don’t think its possible that Gradus was a real person- just a figment of Kinbote’s imagination.  It is said that murderers usually feel that they are inferior to their victims, and in the case of the novel, Charles Kinbote is very envious of John Shade.  In Kinbote’s head, he may see the situation as Shade being a slain victim that was accidentally caught between two people, when what actually could have happened was that he murdered Shade himself without knowing it.  He himself could’ve been the escaped mental patient, looking for the Judge Goldsworth, and in the middle of it all, met John Shade who eventually became his infatuation.  At the end, when he mentions visiting Gradus in prison, it could very well be himself still trying to make sense of the situation.  He then mentions that he must seek to find another Zembla for himself, which could be his way of realizing that he needs to escape in his mind to another imaginary place, because the world he created has now disappeared, as he is imprisoned.

        Class Notes :  6/9/04   -butterfly symbol and infinity symbol- notion of reflection     Entry # 10  :  The notion of reflection exists throughout the whole novel.  We discussed that even the symbols of infinity and the shape of the butterfly are reflected geometries.  There seems to be many games being played throughout the book, and one of them that the author does is playing around with words and names.  His names evoke a sense of relation to each other because he uses anagrams to formulate them.  They are reflections of each other, and some are literally, like “Nodo” and “Odon”.  Even the first line of the poem shows a mirrored world.  Talking about the “shadow of the waxwing” expresses the notion of reflection between the real world and the reflected world.  A shadow is essentially a reflection of anything.  Another reflection shown in the book is the incident of Hazel Shade at the barn.  She is communicating with an entity that is apparently not of her world.  It is shadowing what is to happen in the future and is trying to express this to her.  As mentioned in class, there is a possibility that it is Hazel’s future ghost from the grave that is trying to warn her of her unfortunate fate.  Another possibility for a reflected dual is that Gradus could also be Charles Kinbote- along with the king of Zembla.  Gradus and the king of Zembla are complete opposites, and it seems to me as though they are warring personalities in the mind of Charles Kinbote.

        Class Notes :  6/7/04   -Zembla- land of imaginary place -Nabokov- lepidopterist    Entry #9  :  After reading more into the novel, it becomes much more enjoyable and definitely feeds into your imagination.  You definitely have to read the book, maybe not even with so much understanding, but with a constant curiosity.  It takes a little getting used to but I definitely love the way Nabokov writes- he describes things so strange and perfectly.  He can also put into words what usually is not even spoken or paid attention to.  I wasn’t quite convinced from the start that the king was from a land called Zembla, especially since we talked about Zembla pertaining to an imaginary place, along with Xanadu, Zenda, Oz, and Wonderland.  I was also very confused about the king in the beginning because it appears to have nothing to do with the poet John Shade and his story.    What’s interesting to notice in the novel, after Dr. Sexson mentions in class that Nabokov is a lepidopterist, are traces of his subjects woven into the story, quite subtly and elegantly.  We mentioned in class that the butterfly was the symbol for infinity, but I wonder if someone in class just noticed that they resemble each other, or if the symbol for infinity actually was derived from the shape of a butterfly.  The poem in the book is very beautiful to read.  It was haunting, and told so much about a life in just verse.  It was better hearing Dr. Sexson read the poem aloud because there was more flow it.

        Class Notes :  6/4/04   -start “Pale Fire” -book written in four parts    Entry #8  :  Starting “Pale Fire” was very confusing.  I kept forgetting that the actual novel was written by Vladimir Nabokov instead of the character narrating the story.  I kept wondering when the actual story was going to start, until I realized that the poem and the commentary were all part of the novel.  The book is strange from the very beginning, but very intriguing.  The way Nabokov writes is hard to adjust to because he has such a vast vocabulary that you need to have a dictionary by your side.  Not only does this book end up being extremely interesting to read but it also widens your vocabulary.

        Class Notes :  6/2/04   -Frye- Third level of belief is what Frye says is the point of all stories -Frye- Poets and storytellers help remind us of what has already happened (anamnesis) -history- “his” “story”    Entry #7  :  According to Frye, the point of all stories is paradise existing, paradise lost, then paradise regained.  Of course this is the perfect way to set up situations to teach people lessons, because it goes along with the fact that as soon as somebody realizes something can slip through their hands, they scramble to hang on to it as soon as they have this revelation.  It’s weird that people need to make the same mistakes and hear different versions of the same story over and over again.  I guess that’s why it is left up to poets and storytellers to remind us of what is to be the result, and maybe it is left up to them because they can communicate in words that can reach deeper into us beyond our conscious level.    “His-Story” does seem to be a product of our patriarchal society and mentality.  Its not anything that bothers me personally, because its just a term that represents what has been recorded in the past.  It is funny that mostly all of it is probably the male “version” of what has happened, but I wonder how different of a version would be written if it were to be written by women.  It might be written in a different structure, with lots of other stuff added, but I don’t think that too much would be altered as far as what has happened.  I’m sure feminists would probably feel opposite as to what degree of alteration is true.

        Class Notes :  5/28/04   -Stevens:   “Death is the mother of all beauty”  - because we die, we are beautiful -Wallace Stevens- great poet of the weather -“A Good Man is Hard to Find” – Flannery O’Connor    Entry #6  :  The concept that death is the mother of all beauty is very profound.  I never realized this concept until it was mentioned, and now I can see that it has been written about in literature through all of history and the concept is expressed in many different aspects.  It seems as though something is more precious and cherished when it is more vulnerable, such as life- this is especially written about in Greek mythology.  The Gods are worshiped, but the mortals are cherished.  If something was completely at one’s disposal, then it would be taken for granted, but the fact that it could disappear or perish, makes a person hold it closer.  This also applies to beauty of a person.  If a woman is beautiful, its usually in part because she looks fragile, dainty, or she’s so “perfect” that her suitor feels the need to protect her from being damaged.  Having a beautiful mate to some people is like possessing a precious jewel.    Stevens does seem to incorporate expressions of weather in a lot of his poems.  I think this is because description of weather can really parable a mood in a person, just like it can literally affect the mood of a person.  “A Good Man is Hard to Find” was pretty interesting to read.  The appeal to me was the combination of a brooding story, the shocking end, the dark humor in the end, and the fact that it was written by a woman who appears to be very orthodox and traditional.  The fact that what’s going on in her head is completely different from her appearance makes everything more intriguing.  The title of the short story is also humorous to me.

        Class Notes:  5/26/04    -Frye:  Why ask questions of what you are going to get out of literature- these are the wrong questions. -“Willing suspension of Disbelief”- to listen to stories    Entry #5  :  I believe that when you read a poem and ask yourself what you should be getting out of it, you are morphing its existence into something else.  You are not taking it for what it is, but changing it because you are trying to add your own meaning to its existence, which robs it of its authenticity.  As discussed in class, there is an experience of the text that is meant to be felt, whether clear or mysterious.  Asking the wrong questions takes the reader away from the poetic text and experience.  Taking logical reasoning out of it- a willing suspension of disbelief- allows you to go through this experience more fully.  As Dr. Sexson put perfectly, what is gained is a sense of how well and wonderful things come together.

        Class Notes:   5/24/04   -Most speech is spoken in a rhythm of iambic pentameter.      -iambic      -trochaic      -anapestic      -dactylic    Entry # 4  :  I find it hard to believe that the English language can be classified  into an overall common rhythm.  Since I’ve discovered this fact learned  in English class, I’ve tried to notice it among other people that I can  hear talk.  I don’t notice it at all.  It seems that any rhythm can be  applied to how people speak, if you make yourself hear that certain syllables  are stressed.  In fact, if any rhythm comes into my head when I overhear  people talk, it would be anapestic.  The “galloping” rhythm seems to be  more pronounced to me in common speech than does iambic.

        Class Notes:   5/21/04   -Think of earliest childhood memory -"Haroun and Sea of Stories" -Frye: Literature has always been there- cannot be more discovered to it as would sciences, math, etc.    Entry #3  :  My earliest memory is of riding in the backseat of a car, probably in a car seat.  I remember feeling very ill, and my mom told me later that I had a cold or the flu.  I remember the window being rolled down and fresh air blowing in my face because I had just vomitted.  My mom had taken off my favorite yellow and green striped sweater because I had gotten sick all over it and she then threw it out the car window because it probably made the car smell really bad.  I guess I was really upset about the whole situation.    I can see why Frye believes that there cannot be more to find in literature as there would be in any other subject.  It can be revised and altered, but nothing more is to be discovered because the concepts and stories have always existed, there are just different interpretations of them.  “Haroun and the Sea of Stories” is such an imaginative text, but you also realize that every situation and story in it is a manifestation of something that is already very familiar to you.  The lessons in it are just altered concepts that you have already heard before or discovered yourself.  Just as the reader relates himself/herself to the lessons of the text, the text itself relates to other lessons from other stories through intertextuality.  Some of the allusions made in “Haroun” are to the “Arabian Nights”, “Rapunzel”,  and “Alice in Wonderland”.

        Class Notes :  5/19/04   -"Anecdote of the Jar"- do you believe that it is an environmentalist poem? -Have we ever encountered a work of art that has changed the way we saw the world?     Entry #2  :   It seems as though the jar in the poem alludes to man-made structures that impede on the beauty and purity of the natural landscape.  By describing the jar that is placed on the hilltop as "gray and bare", Stevens evokes within me a sense of something that is cold, synthetic, and unjust that doesn't belong there.  "The wilderness rose up to it, and sprawled around, no longer wild"-  Nature is no longer the same as it is meant to be when something unnatural is placed among it that dominates it.  In a sense, it changes it from its organic, mystical form, to something that exists to house artificial forms for man.  It loses meaning and purpose.  When "slovenly" is applied to "wilderness" in the poem, the purpose of nature is reinforced because to be untidy is to show that organic form is careless in its boundaries, it flows freely.  I guess I would say that I do believe "Anecdote of the Jar" is an environmentalist poem in this sense.  As far as ever encountering artwork that has changed the way I saw the world, I would say that every artwork I have seen has effected the way I see the world.  Artwork is not only limited to a proclaimed "artist" that makes art to display, but is also seen in so many other parts of life.  Everything is artwork, and to not pay attention to it would be ignoring everything that there is to life- so it has to change everybody in some way.  Being a student of architecture, I see artwork in space, forms, landscape, and buildings.  I believe artwork is anything that inspires one's imagination, whereas they can begin to see manifestations of what was created.  It is always interesting to see the world through someone else's eyes.  I think its most important to pay attention to all the different interpretations because we can basically look into people's souls and understand a little more about what has become of the world.

        Class Notes :  5/17/04   -Everybody has a story.  What is our story and how did we get to where we are.  What do our names mean, how did we    arrive to a place called Bozeman, etc.    Entry #1:  :         I am a third year architecture major.  I came to Bozeman to attend the architecture program because it is close to my hometown and it is one of the best schools for what I am doing.  I have been interested in architecture from the moment I was able to understand the concept of inhabiting a beautiful space.      What I refer to as my hometown is Missoula, MT.  I was raised there from the age of seven till I moved off to college.  It's a great little town with a strong community feel.  Missoula is much more liberal than Bozeman, which I believe is more pleasant to live in.  As far as location, I believe that Bozeman is more beautiful.      I ended up in Missoula because my mother went there to visit a friend and liked it very much, so we moved there.  Before I landed in Missoula, I lived in Salt Lake City, Utah for four years.  I attended kindergarten and preschool there.  My mother also worked in a toy factory, which was great for me being a little kid.  I remember having many toys.      Before I came to Utah, I had still lived two more places.  One of them was the Phillippines, which I lived for one year.  I couldn't say much about it because I don't really remember it, and I haven't been back.      The last place we end up is my birthplace, Thailand.  This is the culture where I originated from, as well as my name.  "Teunny" is a palace where the king and his royalty live.  It is pronounced "Tia-ny" in Thai.  Of course after living in the U.S. my whole life, the name has been "Americanized" by people around me into "Tenny".  However, my mom still calls me by the real pronunciation.  I identify myself as both because I've known both my whole life.  My last name is "McCoy", which is not my birth name.  My real last name is "Heng", which became a middle name after my mom married my stepfather and we acquired his name, "McCoy".  I was six at the time of my parent's remarriage.  I believe McCoy is an Irish name, and Mackay is the Scottish version of this name.  My stepfather is of German and Irish descent.      So here I am in Bozeman, MT spending part of my summer in a literary studies class.  I had not taken care of all my core requirements, so I decided that it would be interesting to take a literary studies class because I love to read (when I have time).
