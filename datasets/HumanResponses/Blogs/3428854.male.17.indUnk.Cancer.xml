      Wuuuuu ... went to the lotr exhibition at the Singapore Science Centre today after wat seem like ages ... cos my pal - clemence ... whom assured mee tat he knew where the place was actually did not ... so there we were ... two peeps wif absolutely no idea where the Science Centre was wandered aimlessly around Jurong ... but at long last we finally arrived at our destination ...   However fantabulous the movie is , the fact is tat in my opinion the exhibition was not ... at most 3 out of five stars *** ... not more ... but probably less ... though there were mani different costumes n footages n info abt the movie ... it simply did not give mee ani satisfaction in the 16 bucks i dished out juz to get in ... so it was kinda a disappointment really ... haha ...  But thankfully lunch n dinner wasn't tat dull today ... for i had KFC for lunch ... n hor fun for dinnner ... much better den the usual n boring cai fan i would have for lunch n home cook dishes for dinner ... so thankfully ...  9 more dayz n counting ... ... ...  =( :D )+  French 'r' frenZ quote of the day : nil

      Simply gorgeous ... yes itz the adjective tat flashes 1st in my mind when my eyez set upon this pair of sports shoe ... simply gorgeous ~* ... pHew ... boy does it lookz great ... in red especially ... n when i logged on to www.nike.com - i found 3 more colors of which the metallic silver came across as - STUnnING ~!!! ... N boy was i swept by this shoe ... another shoe which my eyez caught at suntec ( nike bird n royal sporting house ) was the air max obstacle which itz metallic silver was as goot as the itz former compatriot ... another counterpart which i discovered at www.nike.com was the air zoom swift vapor which came in 3 colours but itz blue caught my eyez for being simple but sleek too ... n guess wat my mum would be asking my aunt who resides in the red blue n white - USA to c if she can get for me one of these pairs of fantastic shoes ... which of cause i would moz wanna get my hands on the flaming red nike zoom vapor trainer ...   Lunch too today was special not tat it was delicious though - it actually cost a bomb , a whopping $27.+++ ... gOsh ~! ... dim sum buffet at the peinsular hotel ... pUi ~ ... haha ... however me n my mum did ate to our full ... n we almoz puke haha ... prawn paste chicken ... kai lan ... kang kong ... black pepper beef ... cuttlefish n celery ... xiao long bao ... xiu mai ... har kao ... juz to name a few ~!!! ... haha though it didn't really taste goot but the quantity more den made up of it haha ... n to add to more of my misery - i actually weighed heavier at the end of the day ... argh !!!  N boy did i make a stupid mistake in thinking tat there was no 30th n 31th of May ... when my calander screwed mee up ... n thus my countdown ... was in fact faster by 2 dayz ... hai ~ ... which meanz i've still have to wait another 48 hrs longer den expected ... so from today ... i still have 11 dayz ... to the 7th of June where my camp would be on ... can't wait ... can't wait ...  =( :D )+  French 'r' frenZ quotes of the day : nil
