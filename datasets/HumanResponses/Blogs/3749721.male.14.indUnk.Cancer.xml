      Did anyone notice my name changing? 6th grade, I was Philip, some called me Phil. 7th grade, I was Phil, few called me Philip. 8th, I was Pip, some called me Phil, some called me Philip. Hell, most People can't spell my name right.. Oh yeah, you can't forget Stacey calling me Philly Cheesesteak. And Anthony called me Philly. And Mr. Porte called me..sigh.. Pillip. Because he said "I was hard to swallow"..

      You know, as I was doing about my day, I finally realize, what if.. What if I don't see some of my friends next year? What if theres too much homework? What if my freshman year is hell? I don't wanna leave you guys... I'm not worried about those other what ifs, because it'll just be like starting middle school again, except with us more mature, and older. But I'm depressed, now. Yeah, I get depressed whenever. But I can't stop the inevitable. I remember in 6th grade..  Now in 6th grade, first "new" person I met was, believe it or not, Yong Xiao. He tells me stupid shit that nobody cares about.. but, oh well. I was nice, and pretended I listened. Heh, I remember Doug in homeroom (Rios). He'd always ask me what book I was reading. So in Malloy, we had to do that island thing right? Oy, I can't remember what Jenna and Taylor did, but it pissed me off. Sixth grade, I grew up on them. I was attached. Gemmy, Laura, Karyn, Andres, Melinda, Michelle, Shela, Ariel, Richard, Jenna, Taylor, Kim, Katie, Scott, Marissa, James, Robin, Ricky, Roslnn, Lindsey, Anthony, Jameer, Eric, Eric Ca., Gabriel, and the like. Last day of school, I remember Marissa proposing to leave to persue her career in music. Hmph, we were all sad, but happy for her. I remember filming all those videos. KLAP, anyone? Anthony and his tennis skills.. I remember Armando swinging a chain, and Mrs. Kamplain getting pissed. I remember those rockets in science, and those rollercoasters. We did so much in 6th grade Sci. Mr. Ohlman is my favorite compared to Mr. Mar and Mrs. Miki. At least I can get a A. I remember at the awards ceremony, Mrs. Malloy let me hold her baby, Dylan, while she went to get something. I remember our field trips, to that Archaelogical site, and that Mission spacey whatchamacallit. I remember afterschool thursdays, I'd stay with the bus people. Breon would always mess with me somehow. I remember when Ariel and Jenna and me had a 3-point shootout. And Jenna won. I remember in P.E. where Mr. Tokeshi would talk and talk and talk. I remember when Ricky asked me to be his partner and I said "No." I remember Anthony always going "Philly!" I remember constantly asking Kent what his name was. I swear, I thought it was Ken. I remember Jeffery Aronhalt and his obsession with Annalaura, or was it.. I remember Isaac running around yelling "Dildo" and "Penis". I remember when we did that Elective wheel. I remember how long those cafeteria lines were. I remember when I got a perfect on the fractions test. I remember when Mrs. Malloy crowned me SotM. I remember a lot more, but I won't waste no more of my time or yours.. To all those people that took the fork in the road, thank you for all the memories. I wonder what it would've been like to have you people til' graduation. I'mma write Part II: 7th Grade, One of the best years of my life, later. Peace (-.-)

      Well, today was fun. First, woke up at ten. Got ready, watched "The Menu", damn that show is stupid.. Anyways, at like 11:30, I left to go look for Mayfair Park. Found it, but I couldn't find Andrew and friends.. So I called, and this "old lady" answered, but it was Daniel. I was scared. So anyways, I met up with D and A, and we waited. Yeah, we mostly ate Daniel's fried rice and played tennis, but oh well. Heng wanted to play basketball, so I went. I kinda regret it... Because this OLD mexican dude grabbed us and FORCED us to play. Argh, I didn't try. So then went back, played tennis, the got thirsty. So we headed over to Mickey D's. Yeah. To make it short, it ended up me and Daniel last to leave. Dan, hehe, was worried about the fried rice (which he had to heat at home, not the one he brought.) Sorry! Yeah, so after I dropped off Daniel, my Dad went off to Anaheim Lake. Stayed for like six hours and only caught ONE fish. Oh well, that was our best so far! Heh. So now it's eleven o. I wanna watch Mad TV.. so I'm gonna finish this off. Oh, and FYI, the picnic group was, Andrew, Daniel, Roslynn, Kent, Lorreane, Heng, Chong, Lindsey, Daniel's girl (Christina?), Sorry if I forgot anyone.. I'll post pics of the picnic later. Bye!

      So I was browsing through that old website of mine "Phil's Ultrapage". Hah, what a gay name. So I remember people that would email, and they actually offered to *pay* me to make buddy icons. I never made them. Hah! So then, I browsed through the guestbook. Turns out some sick fuck posted this:        Name:    urlLink Make Money      Web Site:    The Only Work From Home Program That Teaches You      From:   How To Make Money With Turnkey Adult Websites     Referred By:   The Secret to Success: SEX SELLS!     Date:   Wed Apr  7 15:26:22 MDT 2004    Question: Who is making the most money online today? Answer: Companies and individuals that operate their own adult web sites. Do you want to make more money? The internet is the best place to sell porn because your customers may remain anonymous. They can browse through images and movies and simply turn off their computer when they are done. The fact is that it's easy to own and operate an adult web site. For just a few dollars, you can have a site of your own and start earning a great income!      They're trying to convert me from selling buddy icons to selling porn! ...Hey, not a bad idea!

      So here I am, filling out these damn emergency cards. And I'm really bored. I hate my blog. I want to add a new template, but I'm too lazy. Sure, I start designing it, but hen I quit because I have no inspiration. So, lets have a major overhaul of these pancakes. Who wants to join my blog?! I will gladly accept more members! Damn, I forgot what else I was gonna say.    BTW, I changed the comments. Now it's not  that  complicated. No sign up or anything. Just comment.    P.S. I have a big urge to obsess over something. Or someone. GIVE ME IDEAS!

      Yesterday was fun, I guess. So my family, and my dad's friends family decides to go to Catalina. So off we went. I wake up at 7, shower, brush my teeth, all that shit. We left to the port at oh, 9? We got out tickets for the 10:00 ferry, so we had about 30 minutes left. I figure, why not use my iPod! Then I look up, and I sees this person that looked like Alexopoulos. Maybe it was, but he walked away too fast. So we leave on the ferry, fun at first (I LOVE FERRIES!), then boring later (I HATE FERRIES!). First, when we got there, we did my favoritest thing..    urlLink      urlLink     Drive around in the golf carts!!    urlLink     Then enjoyed the scenery..    urlLink     Then went shopping at Vons!    urlLink      urlLink     Then ate..at Coyote Joe's by the way. I didn't like it.&nbsp;    urlLink     Then went shopping at Von's  Express !&nbsp;   Went swimming, but I have no pictures. ;-)&nbsp;    urlLink     Went to the Casino, see how bored I look?   We couldn't stay at a hotel or stuff, because they were booked out, and my parents only had Monday off. So eventually, we had to go home.   &nbsp;   urlLink     Waiting for our Ferry!    urlLink     These things make big splashes...    urlLink     When the trip was over, we realized we took the wrong ferry, so we ended up at the Queen Mary.    urlLink     So we take the bus! I am "happy" on the bus! (Pretend I'm the backpack!)    urlLink     But we take the wrong bus, too. And we end up at The Pike!   Well, we do end up getting home. And I have a really bad headache and stomachache. Shitting doesn't do me that good, by the way. I would've bought you and me some souvenirs, but one problem:  I have no money.  So I had a nice day. How about you?

      Well, I found my iPod. Actually, my brother found it. In a fold-in cupholder.. Hmm.. never thought of looking in there as I NEVER USE IT. I wonder who put my little baby there... Anyways, glad that its back and this is all over now. Man, all that adrenaline and despair can't be good.     On another note, I got this free DVD in the mail: 7th Street. Its some documentary about the evolution of Manhattan.. Seems interesting. Don't forget to comment!

      I actually ran out of titles! I'm not as witty as I once was... Why does nobody comment?!! So.. I finally decide to buy a Gameboy Advance SP. Heh, my luck is so shitty. My first one had a dead pixel.. so I got back to CC and get a new one! Lucky me, that one has a dead pixel, too! So, tomorrow, I go back, and I get a new one. Fun, fun exchanges. Gah, I'm so anal about these things. I can't stand imperfectons!! Ironic, since  I'm  so imperfect. Oh well. I babysitted again. I hope your day was shittier than mine. Just kidding! Oh yes, I'm going to sign up for a Xanga. I  might  move, most probably not, because I think it has a shitty interface. Persuade me. C'MON!     BTW: I took one of those test thingies, ya'know the one about your favorite cuss word. Mine turned out to be  shit . That was the best moment of my life ;_;

           12 hour battery? Through the firmware? Basically... it's just a 3G iPod with a mini clickwheel. There is no new battery. Just "better power management." So 3G iPods could technically have 12 hour battery life... It's just Apple doesn't want us to.    BTW... I think its fucking ugly.. c'mon what's with the  grey  wheel?

      I read that one post, "Here Comes the Pain" and it made me think...  Damn I'm a pussy. SO ANYWAYS... My comp is broken, I have to wait a  MONTH to get it back.  Ugh, well.. meh, I kinda like my brother's  computer better... So lemme tell you some of my dreams... This one  dream, I was at this grocery store, then the police run in and they're  chasing this old lady. So she stops near the lettuce and takes out a  gun.. THEN this dude that looks like George Huff on Sherbert's body  come in and start laughing at the lady. The lady shoots him down, while  the police stand right next to me just staring... So then, the lady  starts rushing at us and the police run out. Next thing I know, I was  running with Mike... I look down my shirt, and I see 5 pinkish holes,  no blood. Funny because one was directly on my nipple.. So I ask Mike,  did you get shot too? And he tells me he got shot 9 times. NINE?!  Anyways, it ended there. Yeah, just a dream... doesn't fit together  much though...
