        Live  by CMK 7-12-04  I'll build my cabin on shifting sand,  run with scissors in my dirty little hand.  Shun the paths that others have run,  life's tamed strip malls and scripted fun.  I'll burn my past in sacrificial pyre,  forget my name, as it burns on the fire.  No change of address card, not wanting to be found,  life on the edge my spirit abound.  I run from my father who haunts these hills,   sad shamed expression, a look that can kill.  A failure in all that I have tried,  just a matter of time before I cried.  Won't drag another through my muck,  still to tamed to say what the fuck.  No friends where I'm going,  no friends where I am,  My life is so empty, but who gives a damn.  Walk in the path that others have worn,  follow the footprints that lead me to mourn?  No chances, no surprises along this road,  a straight furrowed row to carry my load.  Homogenize the milk of life's great teat,  boil it down 'til it's no more treat.  Give up on living in exchange for life,  obey tags on mattresses... no need for a knife.  Your life cushioned in bubble-wrap for safetey's sake,  pop goes a bubble each time your dreams awake.  Instead  walk with danger as your guide through this world  discover new lands and let your flag unfurl.  Quality over quantity is my new life goal,  until the day they put me in that dark, cold hole.  So heed young men and women of faith,  live life to the fullest and forget your hate.  Put down the yoke and and take up the reigns,  guide your own life through troubles and pains.  For the joy of freedom is what you'll find...  when you blaze your own highway your soul will be fine.

        Play the Game by CMK 7-13-04  Some say  I'm crazy, Some say I'm lazy. Indifferent to the needs of life  today.  Some say I need to go, Some say I want to know All that life  has all that life is.  Run from the harness, never put it on, like a  rope swing in a maple tree a noose for the living.  Walk into the woods  one day, Never even stop to pray, Bravado of the ignorant, salvation and  deliverance.  Why can't I be the same? Why can't I play the  game, that others seem to master never tasting of disaster.  What is  the prize we get? What is the stake to bet? to feel as if we all are one,  staring into the creator's gun.  Hide me now from life itself. My  dreams placed safe on an upper shelf. forgetting who I want to be, turn my  back on destiny.  Send me home to the cold, cold ground, My spirit  gone, but still around. no one here to fault another, I'll haunt the woods,  my only brother.  Some say I'm crazy, Some say I'm lazy. Indifferent  to the needs of life today.

         A New King  by CMK 7-12-04    Beer  cans on the highway where flowers once grew. Pavement and blacktop ungiving and new.  Flaura and fauna once shared this land, where Payless and Big Boy rule with an iron hand.  King of the Beasts the proud mighty bear, forced in retreat to the safety of his lair.  New Royalty enthroned at the local Burger King, crown of carboard in hand for a child's birthday fling.

          Payback is Hell  by CMK 7-12-04   I love the power of storms, thunder and lightning and howling of the wind.  Power unleashed from heaven on the men who refuse to bend.  Our buildings are monuments to our ego and our contempt,  of nature's pure fury for those who have sinned.  We've leashed the mighty rivers with lock and bridge and dams,  Once raging whitecaps are reduced to gentle lambs.  We've cut down the sweeping forests and mowed the grass of the plains,  We've paved the trails of the mighty beasts for wheelchairs, mopeds and four lanes.   We've sanded down the mountaintops, there's litter on the peaks.  We've poisoned all the fish and birds leave six packs on their beaks.  We save an acre here and there and call it conservation, we kill a thousand bears and wolves and call it self preservation.  So when the wind and rain come hard with lightning, hail it rages, I remember our past and chalk it up to karmic return wages.

                                     I Give Up  by CMK      Back to work on the daily grind,  a terrible waste to my stifled mind.   Dreams put away to feed the beast,  my spirit dead and my heart has ceased.   Get up in the morning to start the day,  a convict of life I must obey.   Fight the traffic and curse the sun  I work and I work, but I'll never be done.   Speak about nothing that matters to me,  but the bills are due so I pay the fee.   The house is warm and the car is new,  but my heart is cold and my thoughts are few.   I look to the future and see only gloom,  so I sit alone in my prison room.      How did I get to this place in life?  Trade security now for a sharpened knife.   Walk away now before I pull you in,  to the murky depths of my life of sin.

               My Prison  by CMK 7-12-04   I live in a prison no bars or a key...  of rafters and dry wall and electricity.   All the amenities are here for me to partake...  TV and radio and food for god's sake.   Phone calls come in, but rarely go out...  my friends sell me long distance that they speedily tout.    I chat on the internet but we never will meet,  he's a 400 pound lawyer pretending to cheat.   I wish I was better, but I'm mostly the same.  I pretend I succeeded, am hot and not lame.   I read of far places to where I can run,  where life is so different that my life won't be done.   Excitement and planning fill the space in my soul,  logistics and money to make the dice roll.   But when I am done and I've found a new place,  I build a new prison and lie in the space.   I'll fill it with wonders to take up my time,  like TV and radio or constructing this rhyme.   No lock on the door and the guard has gone home   but I'll probably stay here never to roam.

       A Fine Breakfast by CMK 7-12-04  Smell the bacon snapping in the pan wafting to my room, tempting, inviting and normal.  Hushed voices talking of life, a child's mind grasping to understand. Replaced is the anger... the terror of a child,  The monster that made me proves he is wild.  Gone are her sobs I know that she tried... Fighting the monster and protecting her pride  But this morning is normal, like the ones on TV. The Cleavers are home again, but part of the Beaver has died.  I go to the kitchen and sneak a quick peak, eggs over easy, hash browns and meat.  How long will the party go on? How long will the wolf pretend to be gramma before his fangs are exposed?  I dream of a day when I will be the woodsman, dispatching the wolf and saving us all.  I dream of the day when my fists will be bigger, when muscles will ripple and pain will cause him to fall.  but today there is bacon and gravy and biscuits and jam, so I'll wait a little longer to find out who I am.

       Life or the Lack Thereof by CMK 7-12-04  Where is the order? Where is the plan? Theologians are sure it's guided by hand.  Life is a mystery so much it's cliché Why am I here? to cheer and to pray?  Science is truth the learned will say. Facts are our evidence the clean light of day.  But one day it's fact and the next it's passé Who's to believe anything They say?!  Faith is the evidence of things unseen, so why do the faithful call me unclean?  Science believes in the things it can see Religion sees the things it believes.  Neither have got it, but it makes them feel good. I wish I could forget so I could be good.

         I wish that I could disappear from the face of the earth. Fly to some god-forsaken place on this rock where no one would ever want to follow. I need no luxuries of life.  I could care less if tomorrow, electricity was a thing of the past, cars were but a memory and all other technology was lost to everyone but future  archeologists.   A part of me would be very happy to return to the days of  The Little House on  the Prairie.  I grew up in the woods, was raised on a farm in the hills of  West Virginia, and I want nothing more than to homestead a piece of land in an  inspiring place where the most exciting thing is the landscape.  America used to be a place of opportunity. A place where a person could make  their mark in a new place. Be a big fish in a small pond. Start a community of  like-minded people and be rewarded for one's hard work and intelligence.  Today, America has a caste system. The rich control everything. There are two  justice systems in our country. One for the rich, powerful or famous and another  for the rest of us. If you are O.J. Simpson, Klaus Von Bulow, or Bill Clinton,  you have your very own  Get Out of Jail Free,  card. A license to kill,  maim, rape, steal or do anything else you might want to do. If you are poor, you  can do hard time for filching a Snicker's bar, while the rich can steal millions  and be called shrewd businessmen. The only way the wealthy can be convicted is  if their crime affects someone richer than them. Martha Stewart will be creating  decorative centerpieces for the minimum security prison she will be vacationing  in because she broke the rules the wealthy setup to govern how they operate on  Wall Street. Kobe Bryant  ONLY  raped a desk clerk at a hotel, so he will  get more tennis shoe endorsements to sell $150 sneakers to kids on Welfare who  want to be a rapist just like him someday.    The press, the democrats and other misguided do-gooders will tell you that the  great societal divide is marked along the lines of race, but this is just  another way for the wealthy to maintain their  power. Tell African-Americans that evil whitey is out to get them, and there  will be plenty of money in the coffers of the Rainbow Coalition for the Reverend  Jackson to pay off his whores and his future ex-wives. Tell blacks they are  being discriminated against, and democrats can stay in power and fill their  pockets with special interest money. And as an added attraction, you get racial  violence among the poor, so the rich trial lawyers can send the next generation  of  leaders  to Harvard's promised land.  Keep us too poor to go to the good colleges and replace all the courses that  could lead to advancement and enfranchisement with Women's Studies groups and  racial pride classes about the evil white man. Tell illiterate Americans that  teaching them to speak and write coherently is just another way to dilute their  culture. Give Inupiat Indians a Whale to kill instead of a book to read. If the  poor find any books that they like, explain to them that the books are outdated  and racist. Besides, the only thing they really need to be able to do is sign  their welfare checks and punch the ballot next to the name with the little (d)  next to it.  So, civilization can kiss my ass. Rich people can try to find me in the interior  of Alaska or the Mountains of West Virginia. Rich people in their Brooks  Brothers suits and their Italian loafers do not do very well once they leave the  blacktop.   Wise up my disenfranchised brothers and sisters! Our enemy is not black or  white, yellow, brown or red... it's the color of money... green. Once we all  realize this, we can restore this country, not to what the founding fathers, who  were all rich planters and entrepreneurs, set out to do, but to the dream of the  great unwashed of our society. They fought and died in wars begun by the rich to  insure their continued wealth since this land was settled. We died so that fat  cat industrialist's sons could go to school and avoid war. We suffered so that  they could live in mansions. One day their reign will end and the playing field  will be leveled. Not by communism, but by justice and true equality.   This is our country.

        King of the Beasts  by CMK 7-12-04  Wild beasts among us lurking in the dark.  Seeking their prey among the weak.  Invisible to the beautiful, as they blindly walk by,  the bold of the darkness lie in wait of the meek.  Their lives in the balance of nature's cruel hand.  They spring from the darkness to throttle their prey.  With power and speed they cover the ground,  and the roar of the king strikes fear where they lay.   With razor-like weapons they sink into flesh, removing the objects of their primal desires.  Goodbye to the beauty, the shining of suns. removal of life as death so requires.  Now flee to the darkness to glory and power, and savor the trinkets of death.  For man is the hunter in our concrete world, of strip malls and fast food and glass covered towers.  Primordial terror in the hearts of the meek... the beast is among us and we are the flowers.
