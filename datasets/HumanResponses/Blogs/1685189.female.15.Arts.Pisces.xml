        &nbsp;  I did a lot of homework after camp today, I worked in my sketchbook and i cleaned my room and i did one of the big drawings I was supposed to do. yay! I like my big drawing a lot.    &nbsp;  Today at camp while I was counseling, we went out into the "mud flats" ergo the mangroves and surrounding areas, and we caught a Mantis Shrimp. We called it SHRIMP OF DOOM! it was really cool looking. I highly suggest looking it up...ahem. anyway other than that we went inside and did some boring activities. that is all for the material happenings of the day.    &nbsp;  As for the immaterial happenings, I couldn't help but think of Giacomo all day. I guess it's because school is almost starting and he's coming home soon. I can't wait. I really really want to go back to school. Until then I have to do my homework and i have to buy some art supplies and i have to buy a birthday present for Maxwell and Andrew.... hmm. This is&nbsp; a boring post. i am sorry tomorrow i will write about the reef and it will be better.

      &nbsp;  Today is the day of nothing-ness: Sunday  Well everyday has to have some kind of something-ness, so I will have to work hard to make today a something day. First thing on the list of things to do: (no.1) get rid of my hiccups. I don't know why I have the hiccups, but they just started up. hhmm, perhaps i have a physcological reaction to my computer? who knows, anyway second on my list! (no.2) get some snorkling gear because tomorrow I have to go be a counselrer at&nbsp;John D. McArthur state park&nbsp;marine&nbsp;biology camp, and they decide to&nbsp;tell me two days before that i need snorkling gear (I don't have any, of course, because i need snorkling gear right now, so why would it be easy to get?)  no odd speculations today, I'm too tired from that wedding i went to. Andrew and I danced a bit and he wasn't too happy about it (!) but that's not a big surprise. We stayed up until two and now i'm sleepy... got to go do homwork.  &nbsp;

      -is a rather partly cloudy day.the clouds look some like floating sheep. perhaps they are floating on balloons? so the sheep are floating over the sunny vacation spot that is Florida and it is indeed very sunny and very sticky. thus i am inside enjoying my computer and my not so grandious typing skills.and i have just remembered that i am very sorry to say that my dear friend amy and i never figured out how to make a dual blogging site; so we have separate blogging areas instead. which worked out quite nicely, because i am somewhat of a control freak and in this instance i have full control over my blog. this is good.  Today, at exactly 5:15 pm I will be very nicely dressed and fully on my way to Andrew's mother's wedding. Alas Maxwell will not be accompaning me as was our original plan. but nonetheless Andrew and i will dance the night away and have plenty of fun.I do hope theey have balloons.  Chibi  I am the fastest sperm!

        &nbsp;  What is actually going on::   Today is a pink-ish sort of day. Tomorrow Chia-pet's mom will get married and on Aug. 1 Nani returns from Costa Rica and on Aug. 9 Giacomo returns from Italia. summer's a bummer man. too many missing people not enough hugs.    &nbsp;  What is going on in my head meanwhile(or perhaps it is my liver?)::   I have bought too many books this summer and now i have no money for some things that i need. poo. my grass in the back yard is verily dead and it is ugly.I have homework and i don't want to do it at all so i started a deviantART acount but i don't even have anything good to put on it, so i will have to make something. o damn always creating more work for myself.    &nbsp;  Speaking of work, my artwork which was being shipped from MIAD ( Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design) has not gotten here yet and i'm getting worried. blegh on the U.S.P.S    &nbsp;  must go and be a vegetable,    &nbsp;  Veg-ee-table (toble?)

             &nbsp;   So, I'm in Vermont cruising the internet nice and slow when I says to Amy "will you start a blog with me if I promise to post?"&nbsp; and she sits there reading and doesn't even look up from her book and she says "ok, but you have to post once a week" well, I agreed; but for me, that's pretty tough, I guess I'll have to make a special day for it. I think Sunday is a great day and besides, Today is Sunday. Nothing ever goes on , on Sunday. It's like Wednesday; only worse because you're not required to DO anything, so you sit around the house waiting for something to happen. You know it's gonna be one of those days when the world get blown up by aliens (from oputr space not from another country) didn't it ever sound wierd when people from out of the country said they were aliens? I always thought that was super insane. It was like the wierdest thing I'd ever heard I was like "woah! they're aliens!" and I'd spy on them and stuff. Of course I never bothered to ask what KIND of alien... because I was the all mighty Chibi so i knew&nbsp; everything. Of course, this is when&nbsp;I was eight. Every eight year-old knows everything. Never get into an arguement with an eight year-old; they're possesed by thedevil, and other such bad things. Really they are you can try it.
