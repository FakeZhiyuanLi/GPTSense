      The first hints of home sickness have set in. I think its right on time. I have been gone about and week and a half. Home sickness is a healthy part of travel. I am more concerned about my other sickness.  Today, I am staying in the apartment and relaxing.  Either, I have caught a bug or my allergies have been bothered. Since I arrived in Paris, I have been congested coughing. I know its the smoke. Everyone smokes everywhere in Paris and Barcelona (Spain). I swear, even when I go outside to the fresh air, its smells of smoke.  So either my body´s reaction to the smoke is getting worse or I caught a cold. Nature has also choosen this trip to, for the first time, allow a trait I am sure I get from my Mom to reveal itself. Everytime my Mom gets a cold she loses her voice. Guess what? I have had no voice for the past two days! Obviously, this does not help my already struggling Spanish. Well, I take that back, I have been very proud of myself for reading signs, notices, etc and understanding the gest of the conversation when someone speaks to me. I have been a little slow on the uptake when trying to respond. My brain isn´t moving fast enough to translate what they just said and then pick the words from my limited vocabulary to respond correctly. Not to mention getting the pronunciation down. Castillian Spanish is in many ways different from the Spanish I know from Latin America. Plus, I am in an area of Spain that speaks Catalun an all together different lanquage. Its like Spanish with some pronunciations, spellings, characters common in French.  Over the past few days, I have been living in Antoni Gaudi´s (and other Modernistic Architects) fairytale land. His structures are remarkable. Beautiful and wierd at the sametime. Much like Grace Jones. :-) Throughout the city are gems. Beautiful buildings that are in everyday use today. Just walking up and down a neighborhood street you cant help to be in a constant gaze upwards. I have run into several people and things doing that. I am sure I am being laughed at by the locales as they say, "damn tourist." I know they are doing it cause I do it back home in DC. What goes around...... Anyway, I got some great pics that I will try to put up tomorrow.  I have hung out on the beach and boy have I beheld some sights. Culture shock. We Americans are so pruddish. Here in Spain they let it all hang out. Pun intended. Sorry folks, no pictures.  Hey Melissa and Calvinn (my fellow shoe shopping addicts) great shoes here! I bought just one pair do to space issues in my luggage. Shopping in general is very very good here in chic Barcelona. Unfortunately, the exchange rate is not so great right now so its an expensive proposition to go on any sprees. There is a street called Passieg De Gracia where all the trendy shops are. Its like the Magnificent Mile in Chicago with many of the same stores. There are some brands and shops that are only in Spain. I have mostly been window shopping through those. They also have buckets of shops in what is called the Old City. Really really good shopping here.  I am going on a day trip to Montsarrat tomorrow. Montsarrat is west of the city and is a Montain where a famous monestary exists. Pilgrims flock here as a sighting of the Virgin Mary occured around 1025. The Montains are suppose to beautiful with hiking trails throughout. I will take a train to the bottom of the montain and then a cable car will take me to the top.  Ok, I am going back to bed. I will try to find my voice in my sleep and get rested up for my day trip tomorrow.

      Pics finally up! First round can be found here:  http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?c=8kvwxx0v.3rtjluzj&x=0&amp;y=7bk5cw    Sunday was a busy day. Not so much in that I got a lot done but I covered some ground. I wanted to orient myself to my new surroundings. So I got up this morning and Inir and Ivan (my two housemates from Norway) had coffee and muffins ready. It was instant coffee and day old muffins but it hit the spot.  Remind me later to tell you stories about these two. They are a hoot. Who knew Norwiegians could be so much fun.  The guesthouse I am staying in is quite nifty. It is on the top floor of a 5 floor building in a middle class neighborhood. It is a two story loft like apartment with 4 rooms. All are occupied as it is high season in Barcelona. Mostly young folks who are from such countries as France, Norway and U.S. It feels like MTV´s Real World Barcelona.  Back to Sunday. I woke up with a get things done sort of attitude but my balloon of ummphh was quickly deflated as NOTHING is open on Sunday´s. I thought Saturday was bad but this was ridiculous. Ok, I am an American and I know we have, for the most part, ignored the purpose of the Sabbath. We can wake up on a Sunday and get the same things done as we could on Monday. Spain, like many other countries, truly rests on Sundays. There was however, on glimmer of hope on the horizon. Shining there in the distance I saw its golden light. It stood there like a beckon of any hope I had of getting a real breakfast. As a walked closer I could see it was busy as Union Station on Monday morning. Then I stopped dead in my tracks. I was almost suckered, bambozzled, almost seduced into going to, you guest it, McDonald's. Urggh. I was so upset at myself for even pondering it. And thus, ladies and gentlemen, was the first argument my travel partners (me, myself and I) had on this trip. We argued as we agreed to NOT patronize any American business as long as we could help it. This agreement was made while in Paris as one of us ( I am not going to tell you who) snuck into McDonald's and placed an order. He claims he just had to go in and say the words Royal with cheese (quarter pounder).  McDonald's is located in the touristy area along with many other brands familiar to Americans. Starbucks, Foot Locker, Burger King, KFC, Levi's, H&amp;M, etc. Luckily for me, there are a couple of cafe´s in the area to there were open although crowded with tourists of the worse kind. Oh by the way, in Barcelona the McDonalds are cleverly disguised as cafe´s. I have noticed that there is not much of a "to go" culture here. I imagine its like this in many "developed" countries. Yes you can take food to go in some places but most everyone slows down to sit and eat even at McDonald's.  After eating, I walked throughout the city. I wanted to get a feel for some of the places I would visit and there exact geographic location. I walked by many of the Gaudi sites and a few museums I will at least stroll through. Barcelona is a easy city to navigate through on foot or otherwise. Except for the Old City, its road network is a grid system. And with the exception of major thoroughfares, all the roads are one way streets. The have a pretty extensive subway system as well.  I was exhausted by 6pm. I came home to catch a disco nap cause this kid was stepping out tonight. Sunday is a big night for clubbing in Barcelona. This is a typical weekend night for those who live the nightlife in Barcelona: 10pm- dinner, Midnight - bar, 2am - club, 4am - afterparty, 6am - home. I am not kidding. These folks know how to party. They call this behavior here in Barcelona the Rauxa. It is believed that Catalans (Barcelona is the capital of the Catalunya ancient empire) have what is called Seny, a deep rooted natural wisdom which is still treated with reverence. They also have the other side, Rauxa, an outburst of uncontrolled emotion or just plain craziness. They use this Rauxa to explain the wild parties, Gaudi and others wild architecture, and their wild festivals. I say, they don´t need explanations. These folks just know how to let go and have fun.  When in Barcelona.......so I partied and arrived home about 4am this morning. A few of the housemates and I skipped the after party. The club was MORE than enough. I will have to tell the club stories one on one and not online as you wont believe me when I tell you!  My day of rest came a day late. And on the 8th day (monday), I rested. Mainly because I tried to get up but my body said "Hell no!"

      Today I am in España.   I took an overnight Train Hotel from Paris to Barcelona.   We departed at 830pm and arrived at 930am.   I definately recommend seeing Europe by train.  Before the sun set, I was able to see more countryside then I would have seen otherwise.  Then I woke up to see the the sun rise as we were coasting through small towns and villages.   It was spactaular.  I arrive at a bustling train station.  Unlike Paris,  people in Barcelona, on the whole,  seem to speak less English then France.    A cab driver in Paris could eek out a good sentence or two.  My first cab driver in Barcelona could care less about trying to make it easier for me by speaking any English he knew.   Now my Spanish is a bit rusty.  Ok who am I kidding, a whole can of WD-40 wouldn´t help it.  I DID take several years in high school and college but did not retain most of it.  I spent the weeks before my trip practicing.   Thus far, I am doing a good job.   It did not help matters in the cab though when my brain had a panic attack and begin telling him where I wanted to go in a "Frespanglish."  I kept saying "oui et merci" instead of " Si y Gracias."    I finally asked him, " Quiero ir a Carerra Valencia numero uno, quarto, nueve."  It sounded good I thought.  And it he must have understood as we were on our way to the Bed & Breakfast.   At least so I thought.  Five minutes later we were at an address I could not make out from the car.  I asked, "Carerra Valencia numero uno, quarto, nueve, no?"  He replied, "Si."  Ok, so I got out paid him and walked to the door rang the bell and some little old Spanish man came to the door and started yelling at me.  I somehow doubt he was screaming, "Welcome to Barcelona!!!" as it was 10am by this time and no one was on the streets and EVERY thing was still closed (they get started midday here it seems).    I backed away and looked up to see the numbers "quarto, nueve."  There was no "uno."   Lucky for me I had my walking on shoes on as I was about to hike 15 more blocks to get to where I needed to be.    Why didn´t I hail a cab?  good question, except there were NONE TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE!     One  hour later I arrived sweaty and mad.  Ok so yes I got lost.  But it wasn´t my fault the addresses on one side of a street here in BArcelona do not coincide with the addresses on the other side.

      Bon Jour. Its my last day in Paris and still je ne comprends Francias. Its a hard language for me for some reason. I cannot get the pronunciation down. I default to Spanish pronunciations of letters. How do you say "wrong" in Francias?  The web access went down in the hotel so I am paying for this entry. Web Cafes are expensive here. This will be fast.  Over the past couple of days, I have visited the Louvre, Effiel Tower, Latin Quarter, several other museums (there are fifty million), and Versailles.  The Highlights:  The Louvre is HUGE. I spent almost an entire day roaming its halls. Its a very strange feeling to see something you have heard about since childhood. Seeing the Mona Lisa was, to be honest, was not all its cracked up to be. For me, viewing art is like soaking in a hot bath, you want to just sit there as long as you can and absorb it until your fingers starting turning into raisins (smile). Seeing the Mona Lisa was like flying Southwest Airlines - a cattle call - line up, herd them in, herd them out. I enjoyed much more the areas that were not so popular. After spending almost an entire day, I still only saw maybe a quarter of the Musee. As I said, its huge.  Yesterday, I went on a bike tour of the Versailles country side. We rode to the Chateau in Versailles were the royal behinds of Louis 14th, 15th, and 16th resided. Marie Antoinettes villas were still intact and beautiful. Its amazing seeing things centurys old that were around when Stom Thurman, may he rot umm rest in peace, was a little boy still standing. Marie as a wacky chick. She use to produce and star in plays billed like, "Romeo and Juliet - starring Marie Antoinette as Marie Antoinette." Weirdo.  Pictures are coming I swear, I can not post them on the computers here (no USB port). Maybe better luck in Spain. By the way I leave for Barcelona tongiht.  Au Revoir for now but Hola tomorrow.

      Disclaimer: This freakin keyboard is quite different from American. We use QWERTY, they dont. The "q" is where the "a" should be, the "m" is way across town somewhere and I still cant find the apostrophe. That being said, you may see weird words qppeqr qs I am typing. Please rest assured I am not that bad of q speller. I am just defaulting to where I know certain keys should be locqted on the keyboard. Also, I do not currently have an editor on staff. Therefore, this publication will be written and then its going straight to press :)  Moving on.......  You think you hqve heard enough of a place to know whqt to expect when you arrive. Yeah we sometime pay lipservice to being open to new experiences but because most of us have at least a slight fear of the unknown, we gather all of our assumptions together and slowly they begin to become truth. Paris has turned some of my "truths" to lies. Some things I expected where seemingly nonexistent and what does exist I did not expect. Paris is nothing like I thought, its a hell of alot better. Viva le France!  I have to admit, I was excited to land at the Charles de Gaulle Airport. After the tragedy that happen a while back when the newly built terminal collapsed, I wanted to see what had been describe in the news as a very contemporary and controversial design. Disappointment 1: I never saw it! We landed in a terminal that was noticeably old and ugly. Disappointment 2: at least 6 different planes landed right after one another so we were all herded to 2 baggage conveyor belts. Needless to say it took FOREVER to get my bag but not because mine was at the end of a long line of bags. No, that would have been too easy. My bag was actually up within the first 10 minutes. However, it came up at the exact time a huge army bag (with some oily substance leaking from it. I later found out if was peanut oil). The two together jammed the belt and became stuck somehow. They were stuck in a way where they could not pull them free. Quelle chance! So my first 2.5 hours in Paris were spent trying to get my bag. Kudos to Victorinox Swiss Army. My bag held up and did not get damaged. Although it has a faint scent of peanuts now. yum!  I got lost briefly in the subway on my way to the city. I was helped by a Parisian guy who rode with me to my stop and circled all of the metro stops of interest on my map. He told me to go to the area where the Moulin Rouge is located but "stay away from the hors in the area." did he mean to be that blunt or was his English not good enough to be more tactful? I think it was the former as upon parting ways he whips out a condemn and told me to be "safe in Paris because some girls here are not, how do you say, clean. Au revoir." He then descended down down the escalator that led back to the trains platform.  The city is beautiful. So many old buildings that have so much character. One thing that I am constantly reminded when I travel abroad is as Americans, we do not know what "old" is. Nor do we truly respect and cherish the "old." Knowing that these buildings have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years is remarkable. Lena Horne notwithstanding, how can things so old still be so beautiful! How old is Lena anyway?  The first day I explored the arrondisment where my hotel is located. It is very close to the Bastille and Notre Dame. I literally stumbled upon Notre Dame. It is magnificent. I will post pictures tomorrow. There was a service going on. I participated. My catholic friends would be proud of me as I knelt, stood and made the Sign of the Cross at most of the appropriate times.  After the service, I sat at a cafe across from my hotel. I sat next to this late 40 something year old man and 30 something year old women who eyed me as I walked by. My first thought was, "I wonder which one of them wants me. As soon as I sit down, I need to look in my French book and review the  thanks but no thanks  phrases. I ordered a cafe au lait and begin to sip. I then asked for a menu. After the waiter left to retrieve the menu, the women asked, "pardon. Bon jour, vous venez d,ou?" I very eloquently said, "huh?" They smiled. I regained my composure and replied "je ne comprends pas" (i dont understand). Hearing my American accent, they begin to speak English. They said they originally thought I was American (they saw my iPod and they just came out here so not many people have them yet) but then i ordered cafe au lait with a very good French accent. However, when I stumble over asking for a menu, bingo! He,s American!  Very interesting people. He is an author and a screenwriter (i looked up some of his films online today to see if his story was legit) and she is a former actress (very cool!) We sat and spoke for hours about everything from American film to the war in Iraq and racism in America and France. And yes, one of them did want me (see my ego is not always wrong about these things- haha not going to tell you which one) so the  thank you but no thanks  phrase came in handy. I also threw in  Im married  think that would help dissuade any advances but the I recalled reading that the French dont fret too much about extramarital affairs. The conversation remained very friendly and we agreed to try to go see the film "Open Water" on Thursday. Thank you GOD for such a quintessential Parisian experience.  Drinking expresso while discussing art and current affairs on a sidewalk cafe.  Young Literati indeed!  til the next time. Au revoir.
