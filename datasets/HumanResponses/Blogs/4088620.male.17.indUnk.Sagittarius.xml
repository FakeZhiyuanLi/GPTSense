      As I lay in my bed this morning i couldn't help but think, "Damn you money." This because of me not being in Maryland with Joe. But alas, even if i had made it to Otakon, i wouldn't have any money to buy anime there. Maybe i could take on a second job... but then again i wouldn't have any free time if i did that. O! The struggles of the American teenager, so much freedom, so little ambition. Maybe things would be different if i were starving somewhere in a rice paddy. But probably not...

I envy you and Caroline ::shakes fist::  Well, that's all for now i'm going to go and explore blogspot.com In the meantime I'll try and gro acustomed to regular posting.

      The prodigal blogger returns. After several days of wokring non-stop, I have returned to the one place that never changes, my desk. After another mediocre day at the Market, I've decided to quit the bagging industry altogether and move my entire work schedule to the Meat department which I already spend most of my work time. This in part because of an ignorant night manager who is to remain un-named. But this i believe is for the best, after all, the meat department is a much more enjoyable place to spend one's time. Only two more weeks until school starts and a little longer until joe and co. leave me for the college life. In the meantime I'll hopefully get to play some  urlLink wildside  and go to sushi ocean with them before then. In the meantime I'm going to go surf the web.

      Every day, I die a little more. After an emotionally exauhsting morning I had to say goodbye to Simone until Thursday (this not being such a big deal, I have to catch up with some friends) followed by a "heart to heart" with my dad where i confirmed my preconception of disliking "heart to hearts." Why do some people emphasize the past so much when it's the present that really counts? And the present shapes our future so shouldn't we be most worried about ourselves in the here and now? Sure your past affects you but you can't undo it, only acknowledge it and move on. I have. So I resigned myself to this fact. From this point forward I will try my best not to give old wounds a second chance to arise but instead rid myself of them, or at least heal them as much as possible, on the first attempt. And afterwards not look back to them but to my present state that affects my future, instead of looking to my past to affect my present. If any of that made sense, you should become a proof-reader because i don't even understand half of what I feel or say sometimes.

      How interesting could a play about airtraffic control accidents be? come on, cockpit reenactment? O well, i passed that up today to go to the beach with simone and the kid she babysits for. Unfortunately that too was canceled because of a forecast for rain. Now i'm at home, completely alone with nothing to do except look forward to a full week of work at "the market" ::sigh:: this is going to be a long day, and to start it I have to unload the dishwasher, take out the dog etc.
