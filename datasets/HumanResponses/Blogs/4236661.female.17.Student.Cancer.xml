      technically i should be doing this in the forum, but i don't really care to post my thoughts up with all the others who's thoughts are all quite similar!  instead, i'll just refer you guys back to  urlLink  hedley's site   and let you guys read jacob's newest journal entry- 'sticking to my guns'.  It made me feel so proud of him!  i wish i could write free verse now- he's so inspirational! another reason why i think he's so awesome!  I can't wait until wednesday, but I get to see him on monday too! :) i hope we manage to get up close to the stage! even tho i shall be tired, i will NOT sleep on the subway or car or at work to preserve my eyesight, i will!  isn't this ridiculous? i feel like i know someone i never even heard of up to a few weeks before.  but he's great and his entries and songs are so bare-all that anyone who reads them will have a good grip on him. :) MUST go back to Canadian idol on the 1st!  the only bad thing about being there is..well there's a couple- you can't vote unless you run to a payphone (tho it's free, you can't call as much as you would at home), you spend a lot of the performance screaming or listening to the people around you screaming and blocking out the singing, you're too far away (depending on the seats) to see them very well, and you don't know what the judges are saying unitl the last bit, where you either cheer or boo.  good things are- you get to meet them after the show (and they are all GREAT people with lotsa charisma), and they really do sound lots better live than on tv, even tho they sound excellent on tv too). So go check out his entries! you won't be sorry! my next entry will be on the show, even though i know i should have done it before this one...i didn't have much time and i really wanted to get this out before i forgot!

       Haha just when i was getting tired of listening to hedley, my interest peaked a little bit more with an update of their  urlLink website  (a new post in the mind section by jacob- makes you wonder how sick of canadian idol he is) and i got to see a video of them at  urlLink lampost.ca  which was freaking hilarious since 1) the song doesn't seem to match the video cuz they're singing and dancing to completely different things and 2) if it IS the same song, then it is very different and obviously the song is just put in with the video and the video is of random things at random times and 3) you understand what the band means when they say that jacob's dancing is like 'spastic inflammation of movement'! :) i highly recommend their site for some good music (i like ''A' song', 'I'd Hear Heaven', 'GCD', 'I Bleed', and 'Sugar Free', but i don't know what a lot of the titles mean besides 'I'd Hear Heaven'... and for a funny 'bio', listen to 'The Tickle', and read the band's bio as well as the individual bios (my fav is obviously jacob's, but i like parts of kevin geisbrecht hehehe you'll see what i mean by funny)! i'm a walking advertisement for hedley now. well... what are you waiting for? go check it out!      If you're still reading, you're in for a little treat, you Canadian Idol fans (which basically means you, amy...and maybe jadie n steph too)- THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACCOMPANYING THEMSELVES ON INSTRUMENTS THIS THURSDAY!!! WEEEEE!!! yes, i   do   love the musician! and you said they weren't talented, kelly! yes, they can do more than  just  sing (as if singing is really even that easy)! but we shall not get into that argument again.    must get tickets for next week! i shall go for lunch early and line up very early! and going to CNE monday! yay! CANADIAN IDOL LIVE! :) even if we are far away and can't get autographs...  it's the singing i go for, it's the performance that makes me stay! heh heh! :P ;) i should go now...sleep is a wonderful thing! don't underestimate it or take it for granted kiddies!

       Today, me, jadie, steph, and tiff went to STC with the intent to shop and to watch Spiderman 2.  we looked around and me n Jadie (or rather, Jadie and I) bought a prezzie and off we went to watch spiderman 2!  (haha! passing by that teddy bear store- me: *looking at machine in front* that's not how you make cotton candy!  jadie: lexie...that's not cotton candy- it's bear stuffing me: *laughing head off* whoops :p)   We sat in the way back of the rather small theatre which was surprisingly packed for so long after the release! i sat beside some little kid who asked me for my candy during the movie at a 'touching part' (but i didn't really mind cuz i started to zone off... i mean, plz, i got the point in the beginning of aunt mae's little speech) i feel bad now...i should have told him to ask his mother before i gave him candy (2 coke bottles- he asked twice) ...i hope he's not vegetarian... coke bottles are made with gelatin which has ground up bones hahah how can we still eat these knowing that?! and also i hope he doesn't get sick.  or bouncing off the walls hyper...then sick.. gah! feeling stupid   The movie was surprisingly good for a sequel!  almost as good if not better than the first one! it seems to me closer to the original comics, and it opens the door nicely for spidey 3.  tobey looks funny in a lot of the scenes! lol! since amy and kelly have not seen the movie yet, i shall not ruin it...all i can say is...there's a healthy dose of MJ and Peter! :P   I kept singing hedley on the bus and when we were walking around... right now i'm listening to mariah carey's "all i want for christmas" yes, in the middle of august! haha! quite a change from hedley! :P i think i got a bit tired of listening to those songs over and over again! this song makes me thing of 'love actually', a pretty good movie!  haha the little kid saved it..and the story with the porn stars was funny and kinda sweet, and the part where the guy and girl from work ("how long have you been working here?" "1 year, 2 months and 3 hours" "and how long have you been in love with him?" "1 year, 2 months, and 2.5 hours" ...those are approximate numbers, but it followed that sort of general thing) are about to sleep together- watching with ramir is funny- he kept cheering them to get it on, then telling us that we should stop telling them to just go because they had to build up the sweetness or whatever! hahahah!   1:45..church tomorrow morning and must shower and iron my clothes! shall post more when stuff happens! ta

       on thursday, i kept zoning off at work as i remembered last night! ohhhh goodness, i'm STILL a little giddy and it's sunday!  haha! i managed to concentrate at the end tho, and finished entering a whole folder really fast!      after work and dinner and the CI results show, amy came over and i burned my pictures onto a CD for her.  it was SO EASY!! GRRRR!!! stupid damn nero! making it confusing when i didn't even need to use it in the first place! AP EORUW! i guess that only works using thoses number symbols (ex. @%!@) but i like letters.  anyway, after that, i made her go onto hedleyband.com and read about the band, jacob, kevin g. and listen to some songs...now i've got her idolizing jacob! :D ;) here's some gum off the bottom of the desk- eat it! oooo entering the janitor's closet and look what i found- dish rags! AHAHAHAHAH!!! i especially like their describing jacob's dancing as  "spastic inflammation of movement" and talking about his "lack of appreciation for clothing" umm... don't ask! HAHAHAH!      on friday, amy and stephanie came over, somewhere in the middle of me, my dad, and my sister watching the olympic opening ceremonies! it was pretty cool! if olympics ever come to toronto, i definitely want to take part!  (when olympics were in australia, my cousin told me that they didn't have to go to school...that'd be nice :) )  anyway, we popped in wednesday, thursday, and those day's E-talk daily's of CI and watched them... Steph made us replay the part where we were on tv! lol! gosh, i looked like a retard! lol! nor did we make josh's brother proud! oh yeah, i forgot to mention..at the autograph session, josh walked RIGHT past me and amy (as in, he brushed by us) and we were calling out "josh! josh!  could you give us your autograph" but he didn't even turn around :(  anyhoo, after watching all that, i shplammed some more things about hedley and jacob and music at them, making them read the poems and thoughts and things jacob wrote, and also listening to more songs!  what talent! i really admire them all!  we also planned what to do to get into CI next week as with 4 of us (jd, steph, n of course me n amy) we have to go EXTRA crazy to get tickets all together too.  we had some stupid crazy suggestions which shall result in me laughing my ass off everytime someone mentions cupid now! :P HAHAHAHAH! ask steph- i did it on the bus today!  they went home at 11:30 and i listened to the songs again.... they need to write and post up more songs to listen to!  damn computer crash- i want my winamp back! and my adobe photoshop and macromedia flash!!! WAHHH!! wanna start working on the 2nd d/h flash movie! MUST find CDs!!!      well thats it on this subject for now! ciao! more to come very soon!

       Haha i'm sorry, but i really needed this blogspot so I could rave and rave long about Canadian Idol (from now on referred to as CI since it's too long to type out)anyway, Wednesday was THE best day of my summer!    i was so jumpy at work i kept on shaking my leg around as i data-entered! lol! luckily i'm in a cubicle isolated from everyone else so i didn't piss anyone off! Amy and I kept on emailing each other saying things like 'omg i'm so excited'... 'blah blah blah' etc. lol!     finally 4:40 came (i had a little countdown going in my mind and i ran out of that cubicle at 4:40 so i could change and grab everything (and leave some things behind cuz my bag was heavy enough as it was) and run to the subway station to meet amywe subway-ed down to union feeling like idiots because we were carrying those teeny-bopper posters.    We started following the signs and directions around to the skywalk, then through the skywalk to find the north metro convention centre (the south was where the uni fair was last year) and finally we were almost there and we heard screaming...outside the building.. and were like..shoooot, they've begun lining up already! so we raced out and found that there were a bunch of people there already, but we weren't too far from the entrance (even though we couldn't see it). We joined the screaming hordes of fans and joined in enthusiastically! thanks to amy's wonderful costume of a mask and cape with her 'kalan is my hero' sign, we got rush seats and entered canadian idol's john bassett theatre!! my very first concert- CI!!! great fun!    we sat beside some woman from ottawa who waved around our pom poms (made courtesy of jadie! thank you!) and finally got settled enough to wave our signs and take pictures of the pre-show things (which werne't much, but we were introduced to the judges as they came out, and saw ben mulroney's godson and john dore's finacee) and FINALLY the show began (signal to applaud)!!    Kalan sang Still..what can i say? he's a amazing, and i heartily agree with Sass' comment: "Kalan, you've just turned from goodboy to dreamboy" hahaha! next up was Theresa who sang Hello, which was a GREAT performance! she sounds SO much better live than on tv- sounds much more powerful. After her was Shane singing Angel.. what a surprise! i never liked him much before, but after the first few wobbly notes, it was really good! great song selection for him! after came Kaleb singing Truly who i thought pulled up a bit short on his performance this time- i've just gotten used to his style, and he didn't change it around as much as he usually did.. and i really wish he'd stop doing that little shoulder-gangster-rapping thingy! STOP IT!!!! (well..guess i won't be bugged by that anymore, which makes me a little sad...he really was a great singer and performer! my fav performance of his was his sing-out of Truly which i thought was 'truly' excellent! haha oh no stop me, i'm sounding like sass. Anyhoo, after Kaleb came the idol i've been waiting for- Jacob!! he sang Breakhouse which was a good performance, but definitely not his best! it still wasn't that bad, but my all-time favourite of his performances was 'everything' by lifehouse during the rock 'n roll week, closely follwed by david bowie's 'space oddity'. during his interview with ben, the camera flashed to me and amy (i was screaming like a maniac..i think i was yelling 'we love you jacob!!...i said -something 'jacob' anyway...and waving around my poster (JACOB ROX MY SOX) and amy was clapping)! woo hoo, on national tv! after jacob came Elena who sang 'Fancy Dancer' and i thought her performance was SOOOO GREAT! i was unbelieving when i saw that she was in the bottom two the next day. jason came last, and i was so happy to see that he was singing a slow song (Easy)- a much better change from his usually upbeat songs which were more shouting than singing.    Then came autograph time! I GOT EVERYBODY'S AUTOGRAPH OR PICTURE WITH THEM! let's see..first was Jacob- he signed my poster! haha! i passed it up to him and he played with the finger a bit and gave me this weird look and he signed it and when he passed it back to me, he was like 'Guess what?' me: 'what?' him: 'I dress myself!' me: 'uhhh.... cool!' haha! damn...i should have said 'good for you! you look awesome!' ... he looks even better in person than on tv, and that is SO RARELY true these days! i also saw him with his girlfriend right at the beginning of the autograph signing. him: 'hey! it's my girlfriend! how'd they let you up here so fast? *leans down and kisses her* i'll talk to you later' haha! it was a very cute and tasteful exchange- not like those ppl in the cafe at lunch...i mean, plz, people eating here! then i got kaleb's autograph, followed by jason's (on my shirt- which i had painted and thus ruined, but is no longer ruined and has been transformed to awesome because of the autographs :) ) and met amy who was still waiting for kalan to sign her cape. meanwhile I got a picture with theresa and shane, and finally with kalan (after they had turned off most of the theatre lights and told everyone to go home...besides the final avid fangirl and the idols' friends and family, we were one of the last to leave. We then subway-ed home, laughing and shrieking about what a great time we had...and we did! WOO FOR CANADIAN IDOL!!
