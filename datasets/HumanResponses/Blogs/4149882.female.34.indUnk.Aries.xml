      I have finished my Shapely Tank. I think the fit is wonderful. I really love this tank. Woo Hoo.        Its funny, just yesterday I joined the Tank Along and now my tank is done. That was fast. I think this pattern would have been better if written in the round. I may rework it for the round and try knitting another tank. This will be the first time I have tried re-working a pattern.  I used Berroco Cotton Twist yarn, but I do not really like it.  The yarn split very easily which made working with it difficult.  So, this will probably be the last project that I make with Cotton Twist.

      We are starting our own digital photography business called Cascade360. We specialize in panoramic photographs for virtual tours. Check us out at our website:  urlLink http://www.cascade360.com . Our virtual tours are really neat. You can scroll the image to show you the entire room as if you were standing in the room. You can also zoom in if there is something you'd like a closer look at. Lastly, we can put in hotspots which give more detailed information about the item in the photograph.

      Today my daughter and I got Italian charm bracelets. Boy, the charms are expensive. It is nice that they do not dangle down and interfere with my knitting. Nothing can interfere with my knitting. Anyways, I thought it would be something fun to do together. We each have 2 charms on our bracelets. Over time we can add more. She is a Brownie in Girl Scouts so I would like to see if there is a girl scout charm. To celebrate special occasions/holidays we can add charms that represent whatever we are doing at the time. She says that she wants a charm to remind her about her family. I think that is a great idea. Oh, I almost forgot -- one of my charms is about knitting!!  :)

      As a Christian and a follower of Christ, I know that I am in the world but not of the world. Lately, this truth has taken on a new deeper meaning to me. I used to think that it just meant that I am here only temporarily. But I think it also means that there are times when the culture I live in will clash with my values. This is particularly true during election season. Because the Republican Party is pro-life (or anti-abortion) they are claiming to be the Christian party. The truth is they are not any more Christian or moral than any other party and they are not pro-life. Think about it. They are very callous to the poor. Jesus was poor. If you show compassion for the poor and unfortunate, they call you a bleeding-heart liberal. They would prefer to leave the poor (adults and children too) starving on the streets. And we have many poor Americans doing just that, right now, today. Is that pro-life?? Is the death penalty pro-life?? Is the war in Iraq pro-life?? Speaking of war, watch out Iran, it looks like you will be next. I think President Bush is a war-mongerer and he seems to be on the rampage. Unfortunately, because he is the President of the United States, he has the power to take the entire country on the rampage with him.  The Republicans say that they give tax cuts to the American people -- but in reality the tax cut is for the very wealthy and focused primarily on unearned income. That is, investment income from the stock market not wages that hardworking Americans earn at their jobs. They say that most stock is owned by American workers -- but how much stock does the average American family really own? Not much. The people who own lots of stock and really benefit are the CEO-types. These are the people who lay off the aforementioned hard working Americans to make their stock rise 1/4 of a point. Nice guys, aren't they??  The Republicans claim to be financially responsible with the federal budget. Really? They cut taxes to the wealthy and then cut primarily social programs and borrow money to make up the difference. In short, Republicans borrow and spend. Meanwhile, the Democrats increase taxes to fund social programs. In short, Democrats borrow and spend. Is one really any better or worse than the other? Either way we have to pay.  Don't get me wrong. I certainly have problems with the Democratic party too. They are trying to win the female vote by supporting "reproductive rights." Call it what it is!! They want to allow people to kill unborn babies for no reason other than the child's life is inconvenient. That is what contraception is for!!!!!!!! People need to think before they act!!!!!!!!! They say that they respect choice. Whose choice?? The mother's. What about the unborn child?? Does the child have a choice?? Go ahead and call it a fetus, that does not change what it is. Science has shown us that we are mammals and mammals have live birth. That means that the child is alive before birth. Do you doubt it -- go listen to the heartbeat at 12 weeks gestation. Furthermore, the unborn child has human DNA. So abortion kills a human being -- plain and simple. Then if I choose to go to the voting booth and vote my conscience on this issue, the Democrats argue that I am forcing my opinion on others. This is absolutely infuriating. You know why -- we live in a democracy!!!!!!! The majority rules -- sometimes I am in the majority and sometimes I am in the minority. That is the way it is in America. I have just as much right to vote my conscience as anybody else. Pro-life people have just as much a right to vote as I do. I will not stop voting my conscience just because someone else may not like my vote. They can vote too and the majority will rule.  Then there is the lying and the immorality. Former President Clinton was doing his thing with you-know-who while the government was furloughed. Come on, people, there is a time to focus on one's job not one's genitals. I was a furloughed federal employee wondering when I would get back to work and how was I going to pay my bills in the mean-time. Congress did eventually decide to pay us because the stale-mate was not our fault. However, there were many businesses and others also affected and they were never reimbursed. Why did this happen?? Because the Democrats and the Republicans could not work and play well with others. Sheesh!!   I could go on and on. There are many things in both parties that contradict Christianity, but I have to stop somewhere. What it boils down to is if one party if for something the other will be against it. It does not matter if the subject in question makes sense. What one is for the other must be against. PETTY!! I do not believe that Jesus would be a card-carrying Republican. In the Bible there were the Pharisees and the Saducees. Today in America there are the Republicans and the Democrats. So what is a Christian voter to do? Who should I vote for?? This decision is not the no-brainer that the Religious Right wants me to think it is. We are to love  God with all of our heart, soul, body and   mind  . I did not check my brains at the door when I gave my life to Christ. I will not blindly vote for either party. Instead I will think and pray and do the best that I can when I vote in November.  My political rant is now over and I shall return to the knitting already in progress.

      I just tried on my Shapely Tank and the fit is marvelous.  I still have to knit the border onto the neck line and the armholes.   My this was a very nice pattern.  I wish that it was written for knitting in the round because I really don't like to sew.  I also have a hard time purling.  I think that this is because I knit continental and it is difficult to get enough tension while purling.  I did get lots of purl practice with this project and I can definitely purl faster and better than before.  I'll post some pictures after I get the border finished.  Right now, you can see my bra and that is not a good sight.

      I got my yarn stash organized today. My stash had been small and dwindling, but then DH got paid and I went shopping. Now I have lots of yarn and four projects on the needles. I really like to be organized. I get a lot of pleasure out of living in a organized, clutter-free space. So, I found some neat storage drawers that I can stack on top of each other. I divided my yarn into three categories: acrylic, cotton and wool. Then I put each group in its own drawer. See how nice it looks? Best of all, the drawers were on sale. Woo Hoo! I love a bargain too.         Just a quick update on my knitting progress:   Shapely Tank:  I have finished the front of the shapely tank and I have started the back. This project is coming along nicely. The pattern says to bind off the shoulders and then sew the front and back shoulders together. However, I prefer to avoid sewing so I have decided to leave them on stitch holders and then I can do a 3 needle bind-off instead.      Here is the picture of the front. It looks like it may be coming out a little long, but I think this will be ok.   Kyoto:  I am thinking about modifying my Kyoto. The pattern calls for a lot of sewing together of pieces. But I am a knitter not a sewer. So I thought that instead of binding off the sash, I would change to my main color and keep knitting in the round for a few inches. This would also increase the length of the sweater. Then I thought I would put the stitiches for the front on stitch holders and do the back. Lastly I would come back and to the front. For the collar, I will pick up stitches. Hopefully I won't have to do any sewing.    Basketweave Pullover:  No progress. I have been infatuated with my tank top. Besides, it will be a while before it is cold enough for DH to wear it.

      Sean turned three today. We had a nice celebration for him -- spaghetti and meatballs for dinner followed by cake and ice cream. It was a small celebration, just us and some friends of the family. Sean really liked all of his presents. His loot includes: playskool speedstars racetrack and avalanche, viewmaster Toy Story 2 version, megablocks dumptruck. red metal old-fashioned radio flyer tricycle and helmet, and a remote control car. He loved the racetrack the best. It is a simple figure 8 racetrack with wind-up cars. No batteries and extremely sturdy. We had lots of fun racing cars. Allen and Sean even staged their own version of a demolition derby.              Oh yeah.  He also got some Buzz Lightyear t-shirts.  He absolutely loves Buzz Lightyear.

      Today was Katie's last day of swimming lessons.  She had lessons for the past four weeks at Camp Volasuka in Sultan, Wa.   She has learned so much -- Jake the instructor was awesome. She learned both crawl stroke and breast stroke. Woo Hoo. While Katie had her lessons, Sean got to play in the wading pool.   Sean is very comfortable playing in the wading pool.  He doesn't even need me to go in with him.  My goal for Katie was that she learn to swim and she did.  My goal for Sean was that he become comfortable in the water and he did. Yeah!

      I messed up on my guage on the shapely tank.  I thought I was knitting 5 sts/in but in reality it was more like 4.5 sts/in.  The result is my tank was coming out way too big for me.  So, I am sending it to the frog pond and starting all over again.  Nuts!

      Well after a break from the heat, it is getting hot here again. My little son has decided that he want to wear his overalls (the long pants kind). He never liked them before, but today, when it is hot, he wants to wear them. Go figure. I took the kids to swimming lessons today so they got a chance the cool off and play.  While they were doing that, I sat in the shade and cast on for my  urlLink shapely tank . The yarn I am using is Berroco's Cotton Twist color # 8311 which is a nice shade of red. I had originally bought the yarn to make the Chevron Tank, but decided that the yarn wasn't suitable for that project. Since the yarn itself is great yarn, I decided to switch projects.       I did a lot of casting on this weekend. I cast on for my  urlLink Kyoto  -- the yarn for this project is Casecade Yarn's Pima Silk. It is a very nice feeling soft yarn. I love the way it feels. I joined the second Kyoto knit-along. It will be nice to see all the finished kyotos out there.        The absolute best thing about today is that my husband and I got a year's of free gym dues. We are starting a digital photography business specializing in panoramic photographs. We did a set of panoramics free for our gym so that we could use them on our website as an example of our work. They loved them so much that they asked if we would do panoramics of their other two gyms. So they are giving us free dues in exchange for the photoshoots. Woo Hoo!! Our first paying customer.  Sadly, tomorrow is the last time DS will have a session with his speech therapist.  He is turning 3 on Saturday and will be too old for the Birth to Three program.  He did qualify for the developmental preschool at our public school.  So he will get more speech therapy, but not from Laura.  We'll miss Laura and hope we can keep in touch with her as friends.

      Allen and I looked through the Fall 2004 issue of Interweave Knits and he really liked the Basket Weave Pullover. So he chose a yarn that he liked and I ordered it. I needed 11 skeins of yarn. 11 skeins!!?? I have never knit anything that required so much yarn as this pullover will. So, I must be crazy, but I am going to do it. I think that if I start now, I may have it finished by November/December. The yarn he chose was Brown Sheep's Nature Spun and the color is Roasted Coffee. See, he really is a coffee-fanatic.

      I made the felted marsupial tote bag from Stitch 'n B****. I made it about 50% wider and taller than the pattern called for. I am going to use it for carrying our stuff to the kids' swimming lessons.  Unfelted Marsupial Tote:    Felted Marsupial Tote    I took it to the pool today along with my digital camera to take pictures of the kids. I realized that it would be nice to have a pocket on the inside for carrying my camera. I have some leftover yarn, so I am going to try making a pocket and attaching it to the inside of the tote bag. The little purse/coin bag, whatever, was really nice for holding my car keys.

      I've seen other people's blogs, and I thought whay not try making one too? So here goes. I have no idea how often I'll be posting here.  Time will tell.  I've played around with the templates and I found one that I like.  I also discovered that I can edit my posts.  Woo Hoo!  I am such a perfectionist and I love improving things.  But, you know what, knitting is helping me overcome perfectionism.  Every time I started to knit something, I would tell myself that this one will be perfect.  Then I would make a mistake, but not discover it for a while.  I was forced to decide, is it worth it to fix it.  Sometimes I decide to leave it.  Now that is progress.  I am going to find a nice photo of myself to add to my profile.  It sure looks like it could use a picture up in the corner there.
