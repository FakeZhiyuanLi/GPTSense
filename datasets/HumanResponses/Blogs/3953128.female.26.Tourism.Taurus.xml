       aaargghhhhh........ Injury proned.... shucks... even as I halfway typing this... The chair rolled over my toe! Idiot! Put red coz its danger!!!!!       It started out with wakeboarding... Did a mini "air rally".. Didn't even know what's that... Flew up and wham slam into the water.. Ouch.  then more... I slam head down a few times.. .One of the time my teeth cut my upper lips and started to bleed.... hmm Vincent knew that my gums will be bleeding but when I came up and showed him.. He was quite surprised... Then my thighs were all blue black....  then I dragged myself to play hockey.... Wanted to mark georg... Ended up on the ground.. My knee in a damn bloody awkward position... And shucks its the same knee that wasn't recovered! Took my stick to support myself and the blade of the stick broke! aaaaarggggghhhhhhhh  so angry! I have so many things lined up for next week!!!!  going snowboarding!!!! Since last year! Yeah yeah.. But gotta pay now lah... well forget it... juz pay and enjoy myself lor... No big deal...  hmmm.... Suddenly... When I see Vincent... I can almost see myself... He does all the kind of things that I do and he is damn more hard core than me... When he asked me whose hair is longer today.. I realize that we actually do look quite similar...  but no.. Clash of religion.. He's gonna be a monk! (for a while lahh..) and think that he is a damn flirt... But aren't all wakeboarding/diving/skating instructors are???

      feeling demoralised at work now... sianzzzzzzzzzzzz.... appraisal very good... but monetary returns not good at all... now with the new boss... work is very different... think he is all out to get me like that... grrrrrrr grrrrr... think i will quarrel with him very often...   then the office gotta shift... why??? i like my desk like this... i have shelves to put my files, and hockey stuff... underneath the tables there are space for me to put my shoe rack and containers... i can kick a soccer ball underneath my table.. its a mini world of sports down under!   where to place my hockey sticks like that???  then they are slashing hp claims.... grr grrr...   anything i look forward to work for.. is depleting away... what's the point of staying??? but then again.... do i really want to take up the other offer???   its a smaller co. with one person taking care of everything... and some funny(as in weird)colleagues... but its more sports... but that would also mean that i have to give up some things tooo....   hiyah see how it goes... at least i know i won't go out of work.... =P

      Good Day... and busy day... yeah... its a sunny day..lots of people helping out for this event.. which i think its kinda unneccessary, though i appreciate their help.. feel paiseh for them to come back over the weekend.. esp when most of them have nothing to do...   the usual pple to work are giving all out.. whoa! transport people are still the most steady ones.. so are the rangers... really appreciate them lots... hmm even f&b didn't give me as much trouble....   organisers are very happy... so that makes it all of us are happy then... hee hee... well kinda bias... coz they are generally nicer and much more civilized than the previous event group... hmm would this be a case study for a good event? ha ha ha.. the first one was mine for the worst event ever.. prob this would qualify for the second event that they talked abt?   and i went skating with my friends... small thing.. but hmm.. i kinda missed them when i saw them.. the familiarity and the crap... yah... its been a long time... went skating around east coast.. have cheng teng, sit around and laugh at bedok jetty...feeling the wind... whining abt skating back again... this is soooo good... life's simple pleasure... we used to do it every week... and we laugh abt the same thing every week... i feel like i'm a teenager again! ha ha ha..  didn't go for hockey... coz i missed the company... yah.. muz try to schedule so that we meet up more often.. hee hee.. next trip.. fireworks on skates! national day.. we are going to skate to watch the fireworks! yeah yeah... =)

      was reading the da vinci code...  it speaks of the rose...  it speaks of how the bible is actually not god's/ jesus' words... it is just a compilation of a version of christ's life from his disciple..   he has 12 disciples... how come only a select few has their version included in the bible??   was jesus married? is mary magdalene his lover? soo what if she is? jesus is human too.. but they want to paint him to have certain level of divinity and made him into a deity...   suddenly... i kinda wavered on the objectiveness of the new testament... why didn't i thought of this before?

      This is the first blog...  in my scrap book.. where should i start?  life's pretty boring...  my life revolves round work and hockey... hmmm hockey took up soo much of my time now...  &nbsp; without hockey.. it used to be  gym ... now i kinda missed it... but very expensive to renew the membership...  and  snowboarding..  lazy to go ask permission to go and owe a lot of people's favour... and dunno a lot of pple there liao...  and  wakeboarding ... hmmm muz get khaki, muz book boat.. muz take cab down then can go... sooo much work!!!! and  soccer....  wonder where all the slackers went?? it used to be every fridays...  and coaching the kids at special olympics....&nbsp; i'm too lazy and too disconnected with them to go back to coaching them already.. blame it on the late friday parties!!!! and skating at east coast park with my frenz...  &nbsp; now its juz hockey... waited for the whole week for 3 sessions in 2 days... hmmm...... its gonna be sunday again yeah! but one session in the morning and another at night.. means that i can't do anything in between.... with that bulky backpack and the humongous stix...  &nbsp; gimme back my social life! now i kinda prefer to be left alone... dun feel like chatting with people or to meet new people... except for the occasional client.. who happens to click! so now its resorting to putting down in words... seems like talking to myself... ooooohhhh i'm going crazy... heh heh heh....  &nbsp;
