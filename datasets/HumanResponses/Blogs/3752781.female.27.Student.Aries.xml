      today, noah had his first rollerblade lesson from elizabeth and amanda.  how funny did they all look!!   pictures are coming soon on this one.  noah looked great all decked out in the spiderman gear and holding on to the girls' hands.  he spent most of the time on the ground in the beginning..he is VERY graceful...fofl...after trying over and over, he did get to getting himself up and going.  he cannot go far, but it was SO cute watching him try.  i cannot wait for him to get good at it so we can go to onondaga lake park and rollerblade for an afternoon....or morning.  karate was good.  he got his second tip yesterday.  collin was there and looked so tired.  on tuesday, they are going to run tests to check the possibility of cystic fibrosis.  he isnt even 6 yet, it just breaks my heart.  if you feel so inclined, i am sure cindy and brian would love prayers for their little boy.  well, gonna be a busy one tomorrow.  watching ellone and vienna for the mccalls.  more another day!  god bless, betsy and noah

      hey everyone.  today, noah, christen, skylar, tj and kaitlyn and i went to onondaga lake park.  it is SO nice out.  i am really going to miss spending time with noah when i return to work.  at least we will have karate together.  i am thinking about doing the adult class.  i have an "interview" with sensei hahn on july 15th if the surgeon clears me.  went to crackerbarrel last night to pick something up.  i really miss it there.  i was glad that i wasnt forgotten.  there are SO many new people there.  will be interesting to see how the dynamics have changed.  last night todd came over for a haircut, so noah got one too.  todd is such a great friend.  well, its almost the 4th.  i cannot believe the time goes so fast.  my sister and her boyfriend moved into a new place last weekend.  cannot wait to go see it.
