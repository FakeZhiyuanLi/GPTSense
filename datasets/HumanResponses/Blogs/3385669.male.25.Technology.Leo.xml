      Hello,  I'm fresh off a problem solving rush and I just felt like talking about it.  A problem solving rush, in case it's not obvious, is how I describe the great feeling you get from solving some problem that has been bugging you for a while without much help from external sources (ie a step by step guide).  It doesn't matter how simple to issue to those in the know, if it bugs you and you fix it, it feels great!  This afternoon I ssh'd into my router/webserver and found that if I ran any commands that wrote a bunch of text to the console (ie most commands) the terminal would freeze and I would have to kill it.  This happened on every machine I tried at work.  When I got home I tried the same thing from inside my network and it worked fine.  So from that I assumed that it was either a firewall issue or a bandwidth issue, now I am on DSL so I didn't really believe the bandwidth possibility.  So I started to analyze my firewall log to see if anything interesting showed up.  After removing some extraneous log messages and retrying the problem by ssh'ing into work then back home again I was able to see some interesting entries show up.  These entries where very weird.  May 20 19:46:33 DarkCloud INVALID INPUT    IN=eth0 OUT= AC=00:50:bf:3a:49:6e:00:04:e2:18:55:2e:08:00 SRC=192.168.2.1 DST=192.168.2.7 LEN=56 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=4550 DF PROTO=ICMP TYPE=3 CODE=4 [SRC=192.168.2.7 DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx LEN=1520 TOS=0x10 PREC=0x00 TTL=63 ID=61201 FRAG:64 PROTO=TCP ] MTU=1492  immediately you can see some weird things like there is a packet within the packet (the [  ] part).  The inner packet originates from my router and is going out to my work computer so I can send OK but what is the outer part?  The outer packet is from my actual DSL router to my router so it seems my traffic is not leaving my house.    [ASIDE] Yes, in my house we have a DSL router that provides 4 connections, one to each roommates room. My connection goes into my router where I send it out over my local hub to my multitude of computers on my desk (3 including the router).[/ASIDE]  OK so if traffic is not leaving my house then there must be something wrong somewhere and it must have to do with my firewall somehow.  The next thing I looked at was the PROTO=ICMP part.  I went on google and searched around for ICMP and inner packet coming up with something called an ICMP Echo error packet.  What?  It turns out that if at a certain point in your packets journey to its destination has a problem with your packet it will drop it and sent an ICMP error back.  OK so I am getting ICMP errors from my DSL router, woopidy-doo -- what does it all mean Basil?  I figured I had good luck googling before lets try googling on TYPE=3 and CODE=4 to see if I can figure out what the reason is for the ICMP error response.  I quickly found an error code reference that explained by way of a table that 3,4= fragmentation needed.  Fragmentation needed? Huh?  I thought fragmentation was bad!?  What gives!  So again to google to find out what this is all about.  Again quickly I found a short paragraph on packet fragmentation, simple enough really.  If a point on a packets journey does not accept packets of a certain size then it will tell the sending computer that in order for the traffic to pass that point it must be broken down into smaller packets before sending.  This is allowed by the TCP/IP protocol but apparently is little known to the general public.  So my console buffer was just too big to send through my DSL router.  Now what?  It suddenly occurred to me that my firewall was picking up these messages so they obviously were not going to the sshd service.  Maybe it can react dynamically if it actually finds out about the problem.  Hey, it's worth a try!  I added a rule to accept fragmentation-needed ICMP error packets and all of a sudden ssh is working again without issue.  RUSH STRIKES HERE!!  Man that was a dooosey.  Well until next time.  Oh, one more thing.  I just wanted to share a quote I really enjoy with you so here it is.  "Against stupidity, the Gods themselves contend in vain." -- Friedrich von Schiller  I can't admit that I pulled this obscure reference out of some arcane tomb because I simple got it from Isaac Asimov.  I'm a heavy Sci-Fi reader and one really good book is titled "The Gods Themselves" by Asimov.  If you like Sci-Fi you need to read this book, it's great.

      Since this is my own forum for posting I don't have to worry about getting marked as a Troll for First Posting.  Not sure what I mean?  Check out the best news site (for tech) around,  urlLink www.slashdot.org .  Anyway before the karma police arrive and drag me away for starting my own blog I thought I would say Hi.  To start I'd like to warn you, I've never been a good writer so please bear with me on the spelling and grammar front.  To finish I will add that I am a techie, whatever that means these days, who lives in Canada.  I program, run Linux and am currently doing a MSc in Artificial Intelligence (please feel free to make the obligatory jokes :o).  I work for two different universities in Ontario and have a lot of free time to spend with my girlfriend and our cat (picture to come in future).  Now this free time is generally stripped from what should be spent on doing a MSc but I still have a year left so I'll worry about the reckoning later.  Just to make it clear, I am a huge procrastinator, it is my primary function.  BANG, BANG, BANG !!!  Well my time is coming to an end, I believe that is probably ... CRASH !!! qwg; h a

      What a crazy world (computer'ly speaking) we live in.  This last two weeks I have been learning several  different programming languages. It struck me how many there are out there.  Here is a short list starting with the ones I am familiar with (to any degree)(also scripting/interpreted languages are included).  Familiar: C, C++, Java, *Basic*, HTML, Python, PHP, Perl, Shell*,  Prolog, Ada, ASM*, XML, *SQL, Turing, OOTuring, ...  Not Familiar: Ruby, SmallTalk, Tcl/Tk, D, C#, Lisp, Delphi, Pascal,  Eiffel, Fortran, JavaScript, Modula-*, Objective-C, Scheme,  Simula, ...  For a more complete list see   urlLink here  [cui.unige.ch] or  urlLink here  [directory.google.com] or   urlLink here  [www.hypernews.org].  As you can see there are way too many for anybody to  know all by themselves. (Note to those who do: You are WASTING your life!!!)  The point of this blog is to discuss my views on the level of the language.    [My Computer Backgroud (skip-able :o)] Most people who know me associate me with the C language  for one reason or another. (That is to say, if you know  my in a computer programming way :o) I find this funny  since by no means did I start programming anywhere near C. When I was a youngling just starting to learn the ropes  on my families 8088 (two 5 1/4" floppies, w00t!!) I  tinkered with QuickBasic to no avail.  I had no references  that I could understand nor anyone to ask if I got stuck.   This stopped me from getting anywhere.  When I started high-school we didn't even have computers in the typing lab.  They were actual typewriters until nearly the end of the year.  The tenth graders were able to take a computers course in the computer lab but not us sorry niners.  The following year I was disappointed again because the programming section of the computer course was about a week long at the end of the semester.  We  started to learn Turing which is a relatively good language to learn since it has a very easy to use screen graphics  component the get students excited about programming.  (Worked for me) During that one week I was able to get a  pixel to bounce around the screen, random color patterns, and a really basic version of the windows lines screen saver.  I can't remember exactly but I believe I took  computers again every year which included slightly more advanced programming concepts and unfortunately the same language.  We did hashing, automata, drag'n'drop, etc. Essentially we pushed Turing to it's absolute limits (on the 386's we had).  Within this time I was able to buy a 486 with DOS 5 and Windows 3.1 but still no internet. In my grade eleven year the school purchased a copy of  VisualBasic 4.0 but had no idea what to do with it so a friend and I both installed it at home (Hi Kev :o) and learned all about event driven, modular and object-oriented programming.  VisualBasic 4.0 was certainly not the tool that .Net is so it was a frustrating time.  The internet had also come to town and I was hooked up to a local  provider on my 33.6 modem.  Insert some experience with bad  web design and those terrible this is me pages similar to   urlLink this  [ahewgill.no-ip.com]. But Worse. [End Bio]  Well that is enough for today. If you are interested keep reading. Also I will eventually get to the low vs high level language discussion.  Where I describe ASM vs C vs C++ vs VisualBasic vs Python.  Those that are asleep at this point should probably find another blog to read, cause my content ain't a changin'.

        I want a gmail account; :o) if only it were that simple.  Right now google's new email service  urlLink "gmail"  is still in Beta and thus they only accept new people by invitation.  Also people are encouraged to trade their invitations and accounts to others but there are only a few out there compared to the amount of people that want these accounts.  Currently my default email account is at hotmail.com, I think it might be in my Bio if you are interested.  However  urlLink Hotmail  is giving me grief now that I am archiving a lot of email and using it full-time.      Firstly, I purchased the bottom tier of premium Hotmail service (the extra storage option) because 2MB was a ridiculously small mailbox size.  It currently provides 25MB of space and a few other things.  Google's new service provides 1GB for free and is designed for archiving email.  They state that you should never have to delete your email again.  Most other free email services are catching up; Hotmail is slated to move to 2GB for bottom tier customers some time in July.  They have a little bubble about the changes on the Home tab at the bottom right.    Secondly, the interface is missing many important features that would make using it less of a chore.  Simple things like changing the button layout so that there is always a delete X close by no matter what resolution you are using.  They added a "Mark as Unread" recently but there is no accompanying "Mark as Read" which would be useful in mailing list situations (which I have a few of).  Also there are too many problems with the contacts portion to mention.  The main ones are that quick favorites are screwed up in Mozilla.  It too tough to maintain contacts who have many multiple email addresses which leads to a lot of issues when receiving and sending mail when you Junk filter is maxed out.    Thirdly, and perhaps my largest current bone of contention, is the email sending section.  There should be an option to enable the save to sent mail check box by default; or it should be checked by default.  This has lost me countless email messages that I have wanted to go back and look at, (my memory is useless).  I am certain gmail will have this feature due to the statement about email above.    Lastly, I wish they would allow you to setup a forwarding address.  It could even be a forward and delete service I wouldn't care.  I have always wanted the ability to switch at any time to a different email box depending on my situation.  I currently have at least one old email address sending to my Hotmail account.  Hey google give me a gmail invitation please.  Thanks.  :o)
