         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death is such a upsetting thing. But what if you don't like the person thats dyeing? Do you still care? Would you miss them? Well my Grandfather is dying. Evan though he's never been apart of my life I stil care. Why? I don't know. When my Dad was younger His dad just one day picked up and left. Like he had nothing to worry about. Like my Dad and his 1 other brother and 2 other sisters were no big deal.

        Ok so I just got off work. I did the closing shift yet again. I get home go on MSN start talking to a few friends. Then I talk to this one guy (I'm not ganna use names). And becuz I changed some plans around he got all pissed off at me. Now he's saying he never wants to hang out again! Like what the sh!t is that?Â¿? Now he's calling me a big loser, when he's the one acting like a child. I sure know on this though...You need to grow up!!(And you know who you are!)

            Man, Oh Man.I had just gotten home from work oh lets see ummm about 3 hours ago. And guess what time it is...6:23 AM!!Yeah thats right I said it!! And I got off work at 4 am. Also I have to bed out of bed for 10:45 am because I'm going out with Kara and my Grandma. The 3 of us are going Go Karting and just hanging out on the beach all day. So it's not like I'm doing anything that well need that much man power, Right?           Everyone says I'm digging my own grave because all I do is work now. The last 4 weeks I've been working 6 days a week and they have all been closing shifts. It's not like I won't mind the pay, but still it would be nice to go out and hang out with my frineds thats I haven't seen in the longest time. "Oh well" my Mom says I can't have boths. It's either I'm working, or I have no money and me wanting to go out and do something with friends. She says she wants me to work all the time so that way I would never get into Trouble. Like I would ever do such thing! And they call her my Mom! Geeeez!**Eye-rolling**          Anyways I think I'm ganna try and get some sleep now. Wish me luck when I'm on the beach. Lets hope I don't fall asleep. Laterz!**
