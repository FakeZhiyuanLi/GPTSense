       I'm one tenth finished with my Religion Assignment! Woo! Be proud, y'all, be proud. >oP I'm still thinking about how Martin told me that 'everyone hates me' today.. I didn't take it seriously this morning, but right now I can't help but wonder whether it's true or not.. *worries while munching on Sweet Chilli and Sour Cream chips*      I have a fair bit to worry about (in order):      the immunisation I'm receiving on Monday (even though it's not  that  bad)      Finishing my RE assignment      The talent show heat      Mercy Day talent show (if I make it past the heat)      Yearly exams.       Ain't it great?   Gonna treat myself to like, 4 Krispy Kreme donuts tomorrow!!!! How excitement! Well I'm gonna try to finish my religion assignment now. Take care and ci vediamo!!

       Hey guys...      How's ya? Well, here I am listening to CDs and finishing my 750g jar of  n  utella .. When I'm meant to be starting my S&amp;C assignment.. BTW, Sylv, I haven't got a copy of the Religion assessment, so could you please either photocopy it for me, or give it to me to photocopy? Thankies heaps. Dreading an essay I have to do during English tomorrow.. English has become so gay lately..am I right or am I right? Oh well, at least it's better than being at Technicorp.. *shudders at the thought*      Argh fook... I just wrecked my avatar on a forum... Photobucket resized it twice, so you'll need a frickin' microscope to see it... Fookin' hell!!!      Just wanna say have fun on your Geo excursion tomorrow, Carah, Sylv T and Millie!! And can't wait to see your pierced ears tomorrow, Kaz!!! =oD
