      ya well today was diff. lianna left at 10, and&nbsp; we just kinda slept some more (me and emma) and so ya it was good, haha then we called Loren(patricks&nbsp;cousin from newyork)&nbsp;and she came over, we went and got Ice Caps, although Loren doesnt like coffee,and we went to Beyond the Beach and then to How Bazzarr it was pretty fun! ya well then dad took us toPilot house and we got sweet potatoe fries, ya then we came home chatted on msn then walked loren back to her cottage, emma and i came backa nd now were here listen to CHRISTIAN music.. ya haha...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; why doesnt everyone love god?  God is such an amazing spirit, i dont see how people can hear about him but still make it seem likes hes invisible, they treat him like hes bad news made up by some storyteller, but to me, i dont see how people can do that, we are all different but its plain as day that things dont happen&nbsp;by luck or by playing your "cards" right but by living through god and doing for him instead of yourself... Isn't it ovious that God is soooo powerful and amazing, just by the HUGE book written about his only son who was sent here just because the world was going to hell and he gave himself up to save us all from the living hell? you can choose to follow God or The Devil right? why would u do things&nbsp;which make&nbsp;its difficult for u to find where to go? dont&nbsp;u want to be saved?! did&nbsp;God not pay all his&nbsp;blood and tears to the Devil for us, since the devil took&nbsp;us all and&nbsp;decided he wanted to teach us to Divorce, and Kill, and Lie and hurt? isnt there enough shame in knowing we were weak enough not to fight back to&nbsp;that? why would anyone want to follow the devil?!&nbsp; It is said the Devil atchually believes in god, how is that possible if all the devil wants to do is have more power then god? god uses his power to help and heal people, and take us to a better place, yes people die. and its hard for everyone, but it isnt like god is taking lives away from us to cause pain and suffering,like the devil would...&nbsp;he does it because those people and being used for sonthing greater than anything here on earth.... but anyways.. thats all&nbsp; can say for now...:)... love god.. he loves you..

      I love this song sooo much, the lyrics are amazing...  The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful Stop me and steal my breath Emeralds from mountains thrust toward the sky Never revealing their depth Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above  Chorus I'll be your crying shoulder I'll be love suicide I'll be better when I'm older I'll be the greatest event of your life  Rain falls angry on the tin roof As we lie awake in my bed You're my survival, you're my living proof My love is alive not dead Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache, that hang from above
