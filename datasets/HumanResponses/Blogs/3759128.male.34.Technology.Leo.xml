      So for the past couple of years I have been using a 15" PowerBook G4 for surfing the web, ripping music for my iPod.  The Powerbook was great for some of this, and good for other parts.  Being a Windows guy, who appreciates the Mac, and loves the industrial design Apple embraces with their products I have had a hard time finding a replacement for my "tinkering" machine.  Surfing the web today I found Acer make a totally sweet machine, the "Acer Ferrari 3200" which not only has a wickedly big screen, built in slot loading DVD burner but is also a AMD64 which will cruise along.  Obviously with all these neat features, it has horrible battery life and is a little heavy, the other thing I'm not super excited by is that its Ferrari Red (which isn't bad) with a Ferrari logo as part of the case - sigh.  So I guess the future is looking good for finding a replacement, and this is certainly close.

      Orbital released their final album in the UK this week, as living proof that the world is getting smaller, I ordered it from UK Amazon site and was listening to it on Wednesday afternoon.    Itâ€™s a shame that it will be their last CD as it reminds me considerably of the earlier music that they produced - green album, Orbital 2 etc,  Pants, You Lot and One Perfect Sunrise are probably my favorite songs on the album, but as with all CDs I buy my opinions change over time, so (hopefully) I will be able to listen to Bath Time without cringing and skipping forward. :-)

      Tonya had the opportunity to show her photos again, this time in Kent at a small restaurant.  She had a great display and attracted a reasonable amount of interest for a Friday night, in a quiet little town.    The thing that surprised me about Kent, was actually how cool the downtown area seemed to be.  I have been to Kent a few times (mostly to drop off Tonya's Grandma), but have never seen this side of it.   Wandering around, it reminded me of La Conner which Tonya and I visited spent the day in last summer.

      So having put off being a part of the hip blog crowd, I have finally decided to create one.  Its more procrastination than anything else that stopped me from having a blog in the past, so lets see how I do at keeping this up to date.

      On Thursday night Gomez played a small gig in lower Queen Anne, what a treat it was.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were playing at Easy Street Records on Mercer St. Using much to their disappointment rental instruments vs. Their own.  &nbsp;  Tonya managed to snap plenty of pictures of them playing and had a great time talking to the band, while I enjoyed hanging out the crowd listening to some great music.  &nbsp;
