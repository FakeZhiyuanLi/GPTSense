      Well, I'm back from IOM now.  Came back on Thursday but have been ill all weekend.  I've got a job for just one week at a posh architects firm, very nicely paid!  The building is a converted barn they, of course, architected themselves and its really nice to work in, although (here comes the OT in me!) it is a wheelchair nightmare!  I don't suppose I'll ever stop thinking like that now, its ingrained into me!  I've got a few photos from IOM, will post them when I get chance to load them onto my computer!  Oh and by the way, check out the Links section on the right.  I'm really pleased with myself, never used HTML before but managed to do it - I'm dead proud of myself!

      Well folks, it was my last exam today (which went pretty well) and now I'm finally free!  No more uni!  Its a bit strange to think that's my 3 years gone, but I must say I am feeling the lack of weight on my shoulders already!  Well, I'm off to the Isle Of Man tomorrow for the TT races, staying with friends, so I'll update this, complete with photos from IOM when I get back, so watch out for those!  Well, I'll be back in 2 weeks!  Ta-ta

      Well, I've finally got a flat over here in the IOM!  Got a lovely ground floor two bedroomed apartment in Douglas, and I get to paint it whatever I want!  If you want the address, call me, I don't really want to put it on here and it be floating round cyberspace!  I'll be moving over here at the end of August cus my first official day is 1st September.  So it'll be goodbye soon - well not so much goodbye, rather until next time....
