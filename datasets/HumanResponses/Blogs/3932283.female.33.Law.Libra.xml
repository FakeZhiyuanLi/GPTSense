      A good friend of mine is celebrating his birthday this Saturday, and as he is turning 50, I decided to ponder on what that might be like for him.  I realize now that he is nowhere 50 by any measure... he&nbsp;is still very much a boy, playing adult games that is. He has retained much of his boyish nature that I can't help but think that age, is really just a number.  It does not speak of how much wisdom you have, how much love you have shared, how patient you have been with the people around you. It does not&nbsp; say how many friends you have&nbsp;OR how many enemies you have made.&nbsp; On the other hand, it also does not indicate whether you can make more mistakes in life or if you have made enough.  And although AGE is really just a number, to tell you just how far come in life, the other numbers surrounding it would matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;When your number eventually gets called,&nbsp;you'd surely want to be ready with all your&nbsp;statistics&nbsp; to show that you HAVE lived a full and good life. Count your friends, your loved ones &&nbsp;your enemies. Your triumphs and trials, and the principles you sacrificed to get to where you are in life. Everything that mattered to you while you lived. And then, knowing all these, the number you have on hand has more meaning every year.  &nbsp;

      Whoever said that MONEY was the root of all evil probably had come into some money and was not able to keep it.&nbsp;   Money has always affected each person differently and always depending on whether they have been used to having some or NOT. It is something that can rule one's life, with his/her existence revolving around means to amassing wealth, or simply a means to get through life.  Fortunately for me, I have always viewed money as simply just that... a means to get through life.. like a ticket .. to either a plane on business class or coach.. or if you're very poor... a ferry through life's more stormy seas.  I recently had some run in on money, an investment gone bad. And although the unthinkable has happened, I realized that my view on money is what made the difference.&nbsp;Since I thought of money as just a means to get through life, I always had everything else in the right perspective. To me, there were other things that MATTERed more... like the love of my husband, family and friends. Money I could continue to earn, but all other things were non-replaceable.  At the end of the day, I guess it is really what our disposition is on things that MATTER... if money matters to us, then we should just make sure we know the trade-offs of how much emphasis we put on money.  &nbsp;

      As the weekend comes to a close, I am always energized by thought that it's already Friday. Though I'm not one to count the days or even make my life revolve at getting through the week, Fridays just have a different appeal from the moment the day starts.  Its a day to look back at all the work you've accomplished... or not-accomplished, and somehow calibrate your pace for the coming week. It always has a relaxing effect, knowing full well that the next coming days will be one of rest, enjoyment and fun. Its like the second-wind in the race of life. A regular breather to re-set our pace.  Fridays also have a universal appeal. Wherever you are, you know that this much anticipated day brings with it the promise of new energy. Time to be with friends, family and loved ones. Fridays mean that though you may have had your brains FRIED all through the week, you will be given that much awaited break.  And so, let us all enjoy our fridays!

      Once you have graduated law school and (hopefully) passed the bar, you will just soon enough realize that all that studying you've done.. made things in life more complex than it had ever been before.   For one, you were now the repository of all the information your relatives needed. Of course they would not even think for one minute if their requests could in fact be related to your practice, profession or knowledge... you were elevated to the position of JUDGE without the required years of practice.  And so, after some years of Non-practice, i am trying harder than ever to still be legal-less. Knowledge of the law is one thing, but practicing it is definitely another issue.   I've often wondered if i was doing the RIGHT thing. Not directly practicing law i mean. Right and wrong has become more vague after getting the degree. And so, though not in the cross roads of my life, i have decided to just do as i please. Besides.. no one has apprehended a lawyer for non-practice right?? and so my goal for the week is just to continue doing what i do best... not practicing... and that makes me safely say... Right ON!!!

      I was on my trip to Zamboanga when i thought of this blog. I had a strange feeling that I might have been pregnant, but since I had anticipated that moment for so long, I really didn't know then when it was REAL.  And so it was, when i finally made a visit to my OB-GYNE on a hunch that I was pregnant, I was ecstatic to find out that I was indeed ON THE WAY.  But despite all the excitement, I realized that the cliche "pregnant pause" probably referred to everything that I felt now in my life. There is a pause... you have to re-think everything you ate, the activities you engaged in.. where you might have to live when the baby comes out... and everything else you had not considered as a single individual in a married state. Everything just simply requires that you take a PAUSE... take stock, step back, and carefully evaluate the situation you are in.  I'm not saying this is not a happy PAUSE... it is... its just that there are so many things that now come into play that you will need to make major decisions soon again in your life. Where do you want to live??.. do you need househelp? Will you have to move out from the condo?  Aaahhh.. I guess at the end of the day, the nine months waiting for the baby is really just enough time for you to get your act together. To make the next bold move in your life... to pause and then PLAY again..  Oh well... Thank God for the next nine months.. At least I know my husband and I have enough time.
