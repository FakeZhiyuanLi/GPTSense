      I, Andrew Nus (Alias), have moved away from my old blog entitled "It's True, Sex With Sue" and moved to a daily blog named G Fricken R. If your wondering how I got the titles for either blog they are from inside jokes. So kick back and relax as I bring you thorugh the life and times of myself, Andrew Nus.

      I spend my summer days doing a little bit of everything.  I already fullfilled my twenty four hours of community service, as a matter of fact to date I have forty-six hours.  Half way to John Kerry's autograph.  I have been playing basketball (I have been to every open gym!) tyring work I tell you.  I also strolled along a few new friends this summer.  One being Ben Vineburg.  He along with Adam Sharick and possibly Jacob Meyer are running against me for freshman class president.  But Ben and I along with some other friends started a "club" called Brown County Young Democrats.  We work with and support the John Kerry/John Edwards campaign.  Yes! I get to be one of those people that calls your house around supper time and always gets hung up on.  But anyway, it's still fun.  I have been filling the rest of my time of summer surfing the net, getting knowledged of the stupid problems our government is causing.  While surfing the net, as my user name can tell you, my background music is country music, the one and only.  Speaking of which, I got to go down to Ben's new hometown, Nashville for a vacation.  Although this vacation wasan't very long (one weekend) it was jam packed with fun.  Ben gave us a recomendation to the best pizza place on Earth.  I'm not sharing what the place is called, it's our little secret.  I finally got to check off one of my lifetime goals by going to the Country Music Hall Of Fame.  The Hall Of Fame is like Country Music's encyclopedia coming to life.  There is everything there from Little Jimmie Dickens Clothes to Elvis Presley's Car.  If you're going shopping in Nashville there's only one place to stop Opry Mills.  It offers a little bit of everything from movies to reasturants, it even has a Gibson Guitar Store.  After shopping we ate at one of the reasturants in the mall, the Alabama Grill, if you want a home cooked meal that is the number one pace. And of course again you couldn't turn your head with out seeing something to do with country music.  The reasturant had high rise walls with memorabillia collected not only from Alabama but from almost every country singer you could name from Charley Pride and Hank Williams Sr. to Alan Jackson and Brooks and Dunn.  Next morning we did some more shopping on broadway.  This was the coolest, you got to strole along this beautiful street and shop in the many small family owned stores.  I was surprised to see a store owned by Willie Nelson and his family and one owned by Charlie Daniels.  At the Willie Nelson I picked up one of Willie's trademark bandanas.  My favorite store would have to be the Charlie Daniels store.  You walk through and you have the regular market priced merchandise but you walk even farther back and you see the Charlie Daniels Hall Of Fame.  There Was Memorabillia from every concert, every award, and everything he has ever won/done.  We took a short break in between shopping to go to a family favorite reasturant, Joe's Crab Shack.  When returning to shopping I was carrying my camera with the loop thing around my wrist and some weird looking guy was eyeing it up and tryed to snatch it out of my hand.  But anyway after shopping we went to Johnny Rockets for dinner, a classic american dishm again in Opry Mills.  We returned to our hotel to find out that we would be able to get a shutle ride to our scheduled show at the Grand Ole Opry.  The bus driver was so hillarious.  She was cracking us up with all her jokes and giving us advice on our sports.  She claims she was a D1 college basketball player.  Oh I had the greatest time of my life at the grand ole opry.  There were no big names there but the regulars were just kikin' it for me.  Little Jimmie Dickens started off the show with a classic joke from a former TV show, The Hee Haw Show.  Then came a famous banjo player, don't remember his name.  And then that girl who sings "Back Of The Bottom Drawer" or how ever you spell it.  And then some other random guy.  Then Riders in the Sky put a great finishing touch to the show with there tag team yodiling.  I had a ball.  We went to a vacation tradtion waffle house for breakfast.  If you ever touch the "southern border" of the US you have to experience a waffle house, it's like our IHOP.  We then had to say our last good-byes to Nashville and be on our way home.  Nashville has a lot to offer not only in country music but every kind of music, that's why it is called Music City USA.  And even besides music there is everything, events at the Gaylord Entertainment Center which we sort of modled our Resch Center After, Shopping, and light-up mini golf (I'll explain the mini golf more if you ask me).  I made it my lifetime goal to live in Nashville when I get older, or at least go visit it a few more times.  Well that's all for now.  May God Bless Each and everyone of y'all.  Ha Figured I'd put a Nashville touch onto the usual.

       I smile whenever I recall The special moments we have had; Walking always hand in hand Through the good times and the bad Sometimes, I think it is a dream -- The love you give me could not be; But then when you are in my arms There's no mistake in its purity. Whether I'm with you or far away, My thoughts are always drawn to you Like a compass pointing North To a love much more than true. Of all the people on this Earth -- How lucky a person can be; To have found the likes of you, my love, With who to share Eternity ~Matt Giguere~   To A Special Someone In My Life! (You Know Who You Are!)

      Recently rock sensation Bruce Springsteen compiled a list of 19 bands that will be touring along with him in key states of 2004's political campaign including states such as WI, FL, and OH supporting John Kerry/Edwards.  Some of the bands to be included in this event entitled "Vote For Change" are Pearl Jam, R.E.M., and The Dave Matthews Band.   I as a supporter of John Kerry, through the Brown County Young Democrats, plan to attend the concert when it hits my home state of Wisconsin.  Thought I would just fill you in on this.  GO JOHN KERRY/EDWARDS.  Thank you and may god bless you.

      To show how cheap and poor I am I have only seen two (2) movies this entire summer although I plan to see the PG rated Napoleon Dynamite tomorrow. So without further a do I give you my movie reviews for the two movies I have seen all summer:  Anchorman (PG-13): This movie was down-right hillarious. My friend John and I along with couple of our other friends went to see this movie for the first time for John's birthday. I found the movie very funny. I had the whole theatre laughing when I yelled whammy at the top of my lungs when the guy gets hit in the balls (you have to see it to understand how funny that was). Anyway the storyline was rather random, but Will Farrel can put a smile on anyone's face.  Final Grade: B  I, Robot (PG-13): I, Robot stared Will Smith in a futristic robot based movie. The movie was based in 2035 I believe. The movie was about a robot company gone bad. When a computer named VIKI goes bad and plans to kill every human with evil-powerd robots Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) and Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) are put to the test batteling the evil-powerd robots and destroying VIKI. Well long story short VIKI is of course killed by detective spooner, as predicted. The movie overall wasan't as intriguing as i htought it would be.  Final Grade: C+  That's It For Now Stay Tunned For Tomorrow's Episode starring Napoleon Dynamite. I'm Andrew Nus Signing Off. So Long America (Online).
