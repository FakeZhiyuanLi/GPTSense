      I know my last post was rather intense and I hope no one felt assaulted with condemnation ("There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus"). Christ-followers are saved by God's grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ so we are not saved by our efforts to convince others. My point stems from my own struggle with the exclusivity of Christianity. When I say exclusivity I'm referring to our claim that Christ is the only way to God and ultimately to eternal life in heaven. The opposite of such a position is inclusively which claims that "good people" from every faith or belief system will ultimately end up in the same place. This is the popular opinion of our time and I hear it often, "All paths lead to the same place" (Remember this next time you get on Route 8 North when you need to go South).  As some of you know I recently visited some wonderful families in Turkey. They treated me with such kindness and care that it was difficult to even consider the possibility that these kind people would not experience life, in the truest sense, upon their passing into eternity. I want so much to believe that all "good" people will experience heaven, but if I am to believe this I'm choosing not to believe the general teaching of the New Testament when it claims that Jesus and a relationship with him is the only means by which people are saved and that people perish for lack of knowing Him.  If this claim is true, then if I have any degree of love for those who haven't heard, which I do, I cannot just stand by and let them perish but must implore them with every ounce of strength to receive, by faith, God's gift of Jesus.  If you do not believe in Jesus as your means of salvation let me add that at the crux of the Christian perspective is the question, "What does it mean to be good?" Most people, if honest, define "good" as better than average.  Yet when we consider what is average we quickly come to realize that most people are living for #1, that is entirely for themselves and their own comfort and happiness. Sure, we care about family and friends (perhaps because they provide comfort and happiness) but what about the masses of strangers who are in trouble? What about the individual down the street who is experiencing a divorce or family crisis or financial pressure? Are we willing to sacrifice our time, energy and money for their good? Loving sacrifice is what God defines as "good" and he demonstrated this love by laying down his life for us when we were in need, trapped in our own prison of selfishness. And if we are honest with ourselves we must admit that no man was every perfectly "good" except for Jesus who died to give his enemies life.  All this leads me to ask, aren't we a bit arragant to walk around claiming to be "good" when we are often not even willing to sacrifice for our friends (forget our enemies)? Consider that maybe we're not as good as we think we are, maybe no one is, and that we are incapable of earning our way into heaven through our kindnesses (or lack thereof).  If our own goodness will not keep us afloat, Jesus is our life-preserver and those who possess Him need to throw Him to those who are drowning in disillusionment. If you are thrown a bit of truth, will you embrace it our let this life jacket float away.

      Christians believe that Jesus is the "only way to the Father, no one comes&nbsp;to the Father except through [Christ]."&nbsp; I've heard this preached all of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is, if we are willing to preach that the&nbsp;masses of people throughout the world who don't have Christ are going to hell, are we willing to accept the implications?&nbsp;&nbsp;The message that may&nbsp;appear to&nbsp;condemn the world, may actually condemn&nbsp;us.&nbsp; If we&nbsp;believe that people will perish apart from Christ yet are not doing everything within our power to bring Christ to them, we are the worst of all sinners, with less love, compassion and dignity than&nbsp;the man who allows his friend to drown before his eyes when it is within his power to&nbsp;save him.&nbsp; We are murderers of the severest kind.&nbsp; Let us consider the sins of omission and passivity and let us be slower to condemn and quicker to love and proclaim.

      The Notebook: Worth Seeing!  urlLink

      After listening to some of my scattered&nbsp;lamentations on love, Jon and Coleen Penn recommended I see The Notebook.&nbsp; I just arrived home after&nbsp;following their advice&nbsp;and I must say, it was a pretty good chic-flick.&nbsp; What's that? Did I cry?&nbsp; I don't even know if crying is the word; I was wiping snot on my sleeve,&nbsp;everything was flowing.&nbsp; In this case I can authoritatively say that if you aren't impacted emotionally after such a depiction of love, you have a blocked artery to your heart and should get that checked out by a doctor (I hear John Eldridge is pretty good).&nbsp;  A wonderful movie, yes, but I&nbsp;must caution you not to see it unless you want to arouse dormant feelings for your first love.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to illustrate this experience using the animal kingdom,&nbsp;it would be like&nbsp;arousing a hibernating&nbsp;bear from its slumber so that&nbsp;it&nbsp;crawls from its&nbsp;underground cave&nbsp;to explore a familiar but now&nbsp;time-changed&nbsp;landscape; that's what The Notebook will do to your&nbsp;feelings for&nbsp;your first love--wake them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever that person is,&nbsp;no matter what they are doing now, the memories will come dancing across&nbsp;your mind and may even&nbsp;do a&nbsp;tango&nbsp;on your heart (I wish for your sake that your first love is not committed to someone else).&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie reveles in the type of love I&nbsp;started to explore in my earlier&nbsp;blog, "Love Deferred" (see below).&nbsp;&nbsp;A love that connects two souls together in such&nbsp;intimacy that it is nearly impossible for the connection to be broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the powerful forces of time and geographic distance must cower in defeat&nbsp;against such a bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Solomon writes, "...For love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave.&nbsp; It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.&nbsp; Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away.&nbsp; If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it (the wealth) would be utterly scorned" &nbsp;Song of Songs&nbsp;8:6b-7.&nbsp;  Okay, so&nbsp;my true colors as a hopeless&nbsp;romantic are flying, but then again, maybe&nbsp;God&nbsp;also feels such passion&nbsp;and I am merely&nbsp;hearing the distant rumbling of&nbsp;his heart (with a little drama thrown in).&nbsp; I'll let you decide.&nbsp; Watch the&nbsp; movie,&nbsp;read the&nbsp;Word and let me know what you think.&nbsp; In the meantime, I'll attempt to put my feelings for my&nbsp;"first love" back in the&nbsp;underground cave from which The Notebook&nbsp;summoned them.&nbsp; Thanks Jon and Coleen!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (with a twinge of sarcasm, but not much =)&nbsp;

      PS107 stands for Psalm 107, a favorite chapter of mine. The Psalm tells the story of people who have been overcome by calamity both of their own doing and beyond their control.&nbsp; Yet regardless of the cause, God is always there to rescue them in times of distress as they call out to him.&nbsp; Here's an example: "Some sat in&nbsp;darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains, for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.&nbsp; So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.&nbsp; Then they cried to the Lord in their&nbsp;trouble, and he saved them from their distress.&nbsp; He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom and broke away their chains.&nbsp; Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men, for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron."&nbsp; This is one&nbsp;among many--tales of God's saving power--and the story of my life.

      Just a note to say that all of these thoughts are rough and imperfect in logic and expression. I've made a decision: imperfect is okay.&nbsp; I know that if I wait to post until the "quality control" of my mind has its way I will never post, and that would be the worse of two evils.&nbsp;&nbsp;So may love cover over a multitude of errors and may everyone&nbsp;who reads this site be full of love.&nbsp;

      If I recall correctly, these are the words of William Wallace in Braveheart as he attempts to summon courage within the ranks of his men as they faced almost certain death.&nbsp; It's not that I've been thinking about physical death much recently, but rather a deadness of the heart and soul, a lack of vitality, of laughter and of pleasure in life.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the living that I've been sorely lacking of late.&nbsp; Many of the old cliche's seem to have lost their power to revitalize me and I'm left wondering if I will ever experience "life to the fullest."  What determines if someone is really living and how do I know I'm lacking it?&nbsp; I guess my conclusion was reach&nbsp;experientially,&nbsp;an inner knowing that there is more.&nbsp; More of what I'm not sure. Maybe just a good deep belly laugh at life that echoes through every dark corner in my being.&nbsp; Or maybe I just see others laughing at life and wish that I could do the same.&nbsp;  Wallace's statement seems to offer a suggestion for finding life.&nbsp; Perhaps he was&nbsp;suggesting that there are somethings, some truths, worth dying for and&nbsp;until we are willing to lay our lives down for them our souls are not fully awakened to life--sounds almost biblical--losing life to find it, the seed that must fall into the ground and die in order to grow.&nbsp; But if Wallace is right, what battle must I face (where must I die)&nbsp;in order to live?&nbsp;

      Love: What is it?&nbsp; Oh, sure, there is the attraction, the feelings of affection and longing, but have you ever wondered how long love was meant to last?&nbsp;How strong is it really?&nbsp; In this age of shifting hobbies, careers, locations does love&nbsp;come and go with the seasons? As to compared with the weather; there is the freshness of a new interest in the spring. The heat of passion in the summer, the deeper hue of deeper knowing in the autumn, and then coolness&nbsp;of the winter&nbsp;when&nbsp;feelings seem to blow away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does love die?&nbsp; And then when it seems that the February blues of loneliness have arrived for good, spring warms the heart again.&nbsp; The question is, will spring bring the same love or a new one?&nbsp;  When I think of God's love, it is a love for all seasons,&nbsp;a love that perseveres;&nbsp;even when my love for him has chilled. &nbsp;His love is like the sun that extends its rays toward us to warm our hearts again and bring&nbsp;life and growth to our souls.&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat of the sun is not dependent upon the response of those it touches, the sun&nbsp;keeps rising, and shining and&nbsp;reaching towards creation beckoning us to embrace it and live. That's God's love...  Try&nbsp;to apply this&nbsp;persistence to your dating life and you may&nbsp;be labeled a&nbsp;stalker.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp;a young woman breaks off the relationship and her former boyfriend continues to call her and pursue his long-lost love,&nbsp;he will&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;hear that enough is enough; forget about her and get on with living. After all, there is sure to be another&nbsp;woman&nbsp;who will tickle his&nbsp;fancy.&nbsp; But where is the staying power in all this.&nbsp; Where the perseverence that will&nbsp;outlast seasons of doubt?&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if our concept of "moving on" has been acquired from our culture or our Creator.&nbsp; I derive from Genesis&nbsp;and God's creation of one woman and one man that the human heart was made to "fall in love" with one person.&nbsp; "Moving on" is not associated with the creation order, but is more compatible with Gomer, Hosea's wife, as she pursued other lovers in spite of her husbands faithfulness. Yet God did not tell his prophet to "move on." Instead, he commanded him to continually pursue her and take her back in the midst of her prostitution. This is God's love. Always faithful. Always pursuing. Never moving on...&nbsp; I&nbsp;suppose my heart is saying that I don't want to either.

      I've never done this before, but every now and then I desire to have my opinions heard so this seems like a great way to do that. We'll see what comes of it.

      I don't know what your political leanings are, but I'm particularly skeptical of our dealings in Iraq. I always have been.  We've played the part of the western cowboy who far underestimated the complexity of the situation before pulling out the six shooters. But I recently spoke with a brother in Christ that is offering love, not bullets, to the Iraqi people: this is a cause that I do support.   Though he was just another 27 year old single dude from the midwest, in spirit this guy was amazing, a true hero of our time.  It was a beautiful sight to see how a person can be transformed when they are consumed by a truth (and love) greater than themselves.  John Piper has said  that you don't have to master a lot of things to make an impact on this world, but you do have to be mastered by a few glorious truths.  This was the case with this brother.  He had been mastered by the realization that God is worth more than comfort, family, friends, marriage, safety and life itself.  He spoke of bombs going off behind his home and four European teamates that were kidnapped for four days.  One Jordanian teammate was never seen again. He spoke of escape routes and emergency plans for the night when he might be awakenned to the sound of pounding on his own door. He spoke of fear. But was reminded of the passage:  "I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. 5But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. 6Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. 7Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows." (Luke 12)  His friend simply asked him, "Do you believe this or not?"  And as a friend, let me ask you the same thing.  Do you believe the word of God? Do you believe this passage and will your life say, as my brother in Christ is when he returns to Iraq at the end of the month, that the pleasures of God are worth more than life itself?  "My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever." Psalm 73:26  Read this and let it sink in:  Hebrews 11: 1Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. 2This is what the ancients were commended for...32 I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, 33who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. 35Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. 36Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. 37They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- 38the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. 39These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. 40God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect."

      I believe the Lord spoke to my heart last week that the cry of the warrior as he/she rushes to battle is "God save us." (When I speak of battles, I'm not speaking politically or militarily but the all encompassing battles we face in life).  There is a certain irony in this. Rushing into battle implies a courage and radical spirit, the strength of the hero who has mastered his fears. Yet the phrase, "God save us," implies a weakness, a dependency, a recognition of frailty and desperation for God. There are those who would rush into battle confident in themselves, and those who would shrink back recognizing their own frailty. But the path of the Lord, the Mighty Warrior, is to run to battle with confidence in God alone as we celebrate and cry out for his strength to sustain, support and carry us.  "Have you not known? Have you not heard? the Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength. Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted; but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint." Isa. 4):28-31

      Oh Lord, who am I when I am apart from you?  I am dust; dry, parched and blown by every gust of wind.  There is not an ounce of life or vitality in my soul when I am not drinking from your everflowing stream.  You make me live.  You take this dry and unformed dirt and spit on it and shape it and then breath your very breathe into it that I might taste and see that you are good.   You gave me a mouth to taste your goodness. Every part of you is sweet to me even that which is at first bitter; the aftertaste is richer and more strengthening than all that I've known before.   You gave me eyes that I might behold a beauty beyond any other.  More beautiful than the sunset. More beautiful the the mountains and the rivers.  Than the grandest cathedral as it reaches to the heavens. More beautiful than any man or woman, though I see glimpses of you in them.  You have given me eyes to search for you. And I will search and behold as you reveal yourself to me.  You gave me ears that I might hear your whisper as you sing songs of neverending kindness and love to my doubting soul. You gave me ears that I might hear the words, "You are my son, in whom I am well pleased" (not because of my goodness, but because you have bestowed your love on this orphan).  You whisper to my soul, thoughts and feelings that cannot be expressed in English. You tell me that you love me as an only child who is not overlooked but is cherished. Every desire of my heart is known by my Father.  You invite me to eat with you, to play and wrestle with you. To laugh and weep with you. To fight with you as your son, a warrior.  I want to become like you, Father.  You've given me a nose to sense and smell the sweetness of your aroma.  Let it consume the odor of my sin.  Your fragrance covers me. Penetrating every pore of my body that I might posses your fragrance as well.  It is better than the most sensuous perfume.  Let me breathe it and may if fill the deepest, arid places of my lungs.  You have given me senses with which to touch you.  I know that you have reached out and touched me.  I have felt it--your presence so near, closer than anyone else.  So near that you know when I sit and when I rise.   You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.  You pull me to your chest and I hear the pounding of your heart with it's passion for me and all of creation to know your goodness.  But how strange that the God of the galaxies would allow himself to be touched.  Allow me to reach out and touch him, to make himself vulnerable to my course hands and my hammer and nail.  How strange that he desires for me to know him that much.  What love is this?  Oh Lord, who am I when I am apart from you?  I am dust; dry, parched and blown by every gust of wind.  There is not an ounce of life or vitality in my soul when I am not drinking from your everflowing stream.  You make me live! that I might taste and see and smell and touch and know that you are glorious. May your glory fill the earth.
