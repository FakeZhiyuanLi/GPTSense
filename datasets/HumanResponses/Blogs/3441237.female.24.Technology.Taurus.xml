      I was looking for an email in my inbox, and I found some pictures of Jack that I have on my phone and had emailed to myself. He is SO adorable!  I need to take some new pics-- this one is a couple months old.  As he's gotten bigger, his markings have become much more distinct.  Perhaps I'll have more to share soon. For now, enjoy!

      Okay, so I like horoscopes.  For purely entertainment purposes.  Some days, they are better than others.  I get 2 horoscopes from 2 sources every day... oddly, they never seem to "foretell" the same fate for any given day... oddly ironic, that is. Here's an interesting read from  urlLink www.tarot.com  that I wanted to remember, perhaps more for the sentiment behind it than for its value in predicting my day.  Wednesday, June 30, 2004  Lauren Rich, The uneasiness in your life now comes from your awareness that change is inevitable. Even if you are in a good space, don't waste too much energy fretting about what you may lose. You won't really lose anything. Things can change for the better. It's all in your attitude, and if you can visualize the good that's coming your way, then it will.

      I saw it on Friday, and I'd like to post more about it soon... but for now, I just have to make the public service announcement-- go see this movie.  Sure, it's biased.  But it's a bias that has not been presented yet.  And I'm all about the drummer who takes to his own beat, Thoreau-style.  Until I can post more, fight the system.

      It sucks.  Day 3, and I'm already scrapping it.  For the past 3 days, I have had a headache, been tired, and been obsessed with food.  I learned some great lessons from it about watching what I eat and limiting bad carbs, but my body told me that something was wrong.  So, now I'm enjoying a smoothie and getting some energy.  Yaay!  The good thing is, now I'm motivated to work out more.  Kinda hard to work out when you have ZERO energy.     Lots more to say, but no time right now to say it.  Until later... stay away from any diet that prohibits fruit!

      so, my last post is rather dismal.  but it's not indicative of how things are in general.  so i wanted to add a disclaimer to state that i'm using this blog as an opportunity to take snapshots of how i feel at one moment.  obviously, one isn't usually motivated to rant or ramble on about things they have mediocre emotions about.  so, while these entries may seem to teeter from joy to misery, i am not bipolar.  moody, perhaps, but not manic depressive.  on that note, things are good :) better get back to work!  oh yeah, day 2 of the south beach diet.  things are going really well.  i have lots of energy... and i am eating much healthier.  perhaps i will post my progress.  why?  because I CAN.    until later, keep things crazy.

      Okay, so here's the big thing I realized... work is not for me.  Come on, Lauren, you say, we all have to work.  Sure, but does it have to suck so badly?  I've been thinking a lot lately about my life... my career... and, let's face it, I don't want my job to be such a JOB.  So I've come to the epiphany that is driving me to return to school a helluva lot sooner than I'd imagined.  Sure, I figured I would go to grad school in say, 3-5 years.  But the catalyst of boredom is pushing up my turntable.  I mean, one of the happiest people I know in the world is a Professor.  The man LOVES what he does... he LOVES his job, his wife, his kids, his life.  He is just generally happy and totally stoked about what he does.  And that's what I want.  I want to love my life.  I want to be intellectually stimulated with my work.  I want to solve the problems that have no solution.  I want to attack the issues that may not be resolvable.  I want... the hell out of this cubicle, the metaphor for the job that restricts my thoughts to a confined space...  Now, I'd better get back to work.  Joy.

      ... surprisingly (to the common, non-Tool or non-APC obsessed individual) makes me laugh from time to time, such as in this interview, when asked "Do any of your lyrics and vocal melodies come from dreams that youâ€™re aware of, and/or do you feel that some of the lyrics may have come from a dimension of consciousness that exists between dreaming and dreamless sleep that occultists like Kenneth Grant call 'The Mauve Zone?'"   MJK: funny you should ask. that very question came to me in that in between state of consciousness/unconsciousness that few can accurately describe. in that moment, the time between time, i knew the answer, found a magic spider to help me weave the answer in it's web, and then read the answer aloud in a foreign tongue i was unaware i spoke (i'm guessing it was aramaic). then i woke up in a pool of my own sick. the moral, of course, being... know your dealer and know your limits.

      I had to add this one, just because it is FANTASTIC:   No team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals, and the Lakers seem ill-equipped to become the first.   urlLink (source)

      Man, I love basketball.  And I love, love, love seeing the Lakers lose... especially when my boy Rasheed Wallace is on the opposing team.  And, let me tell you, 'Sheed is a badass on and off the courts.  Check this out:   Wallace took his best shot after the game, when he was asked whether winning an NBA title would change the way he's perceived by the media.  "So you think that if we do win it Tuesday or whatever, you think y'all are still going to write nothing bad about me?" he responded.  "That doesn't bother me, man, because like my mom always told me, 50 percent of the people love you and 50 percent hate you," he added. "So what y'all write about [what you want about] me. It's all like water off a duck's back, man."   ( urlLink source )  More to come on this one...

      I found this old zip disk when I moved, and I've been meaning to bring it in to work because I don't have a zip drive at home.  So, I brought it in today, and it's got laurensworld.com from 1999!  Now, that was back in the day when the site was filled with content, and it had some badass graphics. Check out this graphic that was on the first page of the site... I'm still proud of it to this day.  If only I hadn't lost the original Photoshop in an unfortunate disk drive death... But oh well, that's life.  Check out some old skooL laurensworld, and I'll be sure to post more later.  I've got to get this stuff off of the zip disk so I can sort through it tonight/this week.    The original was too wide (it screwed up my blogger layout), so I posted a thumbnail that links to the original. Enjoy!  urlLink

      Man, I just found some of my poetry that's still up at my geocities site (via the wonders of google).  I need to get my poetry collection back up on laurensworld, but I've not had the time, desire, or net access at home to do so.  Want to read what's out there now?  Go for it.   urlLink Here  you'll find an older piece that I featured after taking down my poetry collection (entitled kaleidoscope) in a moment of absurdity.   urlLink Here's  some more recent stuff (about a year old).  Just a little taste to show you another dimension.  I'll try to get all of kaleidoscope back up soon, if anyone is still interested ;)

      That's the title for my most recent (and I believe, greatest) painting.  None of my other pieces have titles, so perhaps that is why I am so amazed by the painting.  And what's even cooler is that the name came *while* I was painting.  For the non-Tool fans out there, the title is from a Tool song (Lateralus).  I should take some pictures of my paintings and post them.  Make no mistake-- I'm no Van Gogh.  All my stuff is pretty abstract.  However, I've only been painting for about a month, so I'm pretty pleased with my results as of yet.  Being in a technical field, I really like having artistic outlets.  Not just creative but artistic outlets, as computer science has the potential to be wildly creative, despite what some may think.  Of course, I don't get that many creative ventures at work right now, but I hope that changes.   Until I can post more about my inner Picasso, keep fighting the power.

      Well, I have many things to ponder and discuss, but I still can't bring myself to post my most pressing (and intimate) thoughts on this blog.  Why?  Vulnerability. Exposure.  Humiliation.  And the like.    I used to encode such thoughts in poetry, so that's something to consider.  Perhaps I will take a different angle and start writing ficitonal stories through which I can convey the same emotions and thoughts... but that sounds like a considerable amount of work when I could just write in my MacJournal or one of my paper journals.  Although I suppose part of the reason for posting an entry to this blog is to get feedback/comments/whatever... another reason is simply to share, though... to release whatever it is that is weighing on me so that I can... Hmm.  So that I can what?  What the hell is the point?

      Check out this article, entitled  urlLink Bike Writer Pedals for Protests , and be sure to watch the video.  At first, I was a little confused by the article.  The video really clarifies how cool Joshua Kinberg, the creator, is... this project is his master's thesis.  The coolness factor of this project keeps compounding to a higher degree!!  I need and want to read more about Kinberg's project... I think it could be wildly inspiring, which couldn't come at a more perfect time for me...  I hope to discuss that at length later.  However, I'm not sure if I'm ready to unveil all my thoughts online.    See, I keep a separate journal on my iBook that is basically a private blog.  That's where I vent and reflect and ponder... I'm not sure if I'm ready to completely surrender to the world of blogging yet.  I don't know if I can just release my wild, untamed thoughts to the world, even if only a few people see them.  That's something I'm going to have to consider.  I mean, I know that I'll never release my iBook journal (or any of my many handwritten journals) unedited in its entirety-- because many of my entries are about things that I never talk to anyone about.  I mean, it may sound crazy, but I feel like, via my journal I am able to work through my issues, concerns, thoughts, and what have you... by having a discussion with myself. I've kept a journal for years... used to keep handwritten ones, and I recently found a neat little program called MacJournal that I really like.  I mean, many of my journal entries are written as if I am talking to myself.  And it works for me.  So can I merge the two?  I don't know.  I think I need to find my own balance between the two.  I don't show ANYONE the contents of certain journal entries, simply because I allow myself complete freedom to ponder any and everything (and I'd be a little embarrassed for someone to see just how obsessive I can be).  So I can't see revealing all my thoughts in a blog when I don't share all my private journal entries with anyone but myself.  Hmm... much to ponder.  My conclusion for now is that I'd like to let go a little so that I can post more meaningful entries on my blog.  Of course, not every entry will be moving/striking/whatever, but I know that I have more interesting things to say than the little tidbits I've been posting. I now have a topic for reflection.  And that rules.

      Okay, so while I am behind the times (or so I've heard) with regards to friendster and other cool web-connect sites... I still think it's pretty cool.  If you've not heard of it or checked it out, you really should!  It's a neat way to connect with people you haven't talked to in awhile or to feel cool by seeing how many friends you can get.  One of the things that I think is really neat is that it shows you how many 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree friends you have.  So you can start your own version of "6 degrees of Kevin Bacon" with your friends, only it's 3 degrees of {insert your/friend's name here}.  Pretty cool.

      Wow.  I just realized that there are comments on my blog!  So I guess I'm no longer just talking to myself... Hooray!  I set up blogger to email me when I get comments from now on... which is certainly helpful.  Knowing that at least a few people find my ramblings at least entertaining enough to read and comment on motivates me to maintain this blog with an increased frequency and vigor.  Man, interactivity rules!   On another, perhaps anal note, I think that I need to add some links to the archives at the bottom of my blog template.  I mean, there are links along the right side to access my archived blog entries by month, but once you scroll to the bottom of the page, you can't see that there are more posts available for perusing.  Just a little something I noticed, which probably has a lot to do with my specialization in Human-Computer Interaction @ Tech.  Yes, I am a geek, and I am not ashamed.    Also, I've been trying to get blogger to cooperate with me regarding date formats and the correct time zone.  Hopefully I haven't managed to FUBAR my blog....

      For some reason, I recently became convinced that my iBook was approaching its 3rd birthday.  When my power adapter died this weekend, I began reconsidering how long I've had it.  So I dug into my iBook records and checked the receipt... I bought it on 11/24/2002, so I've had my iBook about 20 months-- it's not quite 2 yrs old.  This seems important, primarily because I was thinking that my sweet little iBook was becoming a dinosaur... I mean, it performs excellently to this day (aside from the dead power adapter I had to replace today-- which had some cool side-effects-- see today's earlier entry)... but I was thinking that it was getting up there in the years, so far as technology lifespans go.  Anyhoo... while my iBook may be "middle aged," it's still a fresh-faced youngster to me ;)

      I've been trying to get a part-time job to supplement my income... so that I can pay off my exisiting credit card debt... and perhaps one day actually have enough cash on hand to buy a REAL shower curtain ;)  So, this is interesting. This weekend, my iBook's power adapter decided it was its time to croak. The only thing worse than a laptop with a dead battery is a laptop with no way of charging the battery... or even running the machine. So, I checked out apple.com/store to see how much a new power adapter was gonna set me back... $79! Man, I love my mac, but it sucks when things break because it's expensive! Anyhow, I HAVE to get this power adapter because I have work I need to do on my iBook that's time-sensitive. So I figured I'd stop by my local Apple Store this evening... at Northpoint Mall.  Then, I realized something-- why not see if the Apple Store is hiring??! Apple, being it's super cool self, has a job search on its site... even for retail jobs. So, a few clicks later, I'd sent my resume to Apple for a Mac Specialist position at the Northpoint Retial Store. And I'm excited at the prospect-- this sounds like a part-time job that I could actually enjoy. An employee discount at the Apple store would rule, too.  Needless to say, someone from the Apple store called me this afternoon-- talk about turnaround!  I've got an interview on Wednesday for a part-time position.  I only hope that my somewhat limited availabilty (primarily weekends, holidays, perhaps a couple weeknights) doesn't pose too big of an issue as far as getting the job.  I mean, obviously I'm not concerned about my qualifications.  Frankly, I'm overqualified for the position, but that's the point in my seeking part-time gig.  I mean, it's certainly more appropriate than most of the part-time jobs I've been considering.  I really think it could be a fun job... it's the only position I've been really excited about in my recent search for a second job.  Here's hoping...
