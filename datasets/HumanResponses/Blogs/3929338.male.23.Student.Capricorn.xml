      It's been a long time since I've used the following language due to my new beliefs, however, my shit filter has suffered an acute malfunction; it has lost its overload capacitator. You have been duely warned.  I hate the fucking company I work for. I swear they hire the dumbest shits for managers and you don't get any responsibility unless you put your head up someones ass and act dumber than they are.&nbsp; For instance, our manager is trying to get a contract from another agency, something I really doubt he'll be able to do. Why? Because this place would never get nor deploy properly the resources needed; they'd always be pulling them for stupid shit.   Mainly because of the stupid shit dispatch manager. I think she's having a contest with the regional manager to see how many employees they can piss off enough to leave&nbsp;in a day. My fiance got suspended because she didn't do something no one had taught her how to do. (Talk about shooting themselves in the foot and then finding a scapegoat.) Mostly because I think the dumb cunt who's in charge is too fucking stupid to know who needs what training, she's too busy sucking her new flavor of the week's dick and licking managements assholes to pay attention to how SHE'S running things.   Then my friends wife gets sent home because she's on overtime, so that someone else who's on overtime can take her place; just like the dumb cunt took my fiance's place when the dumb cunt isn't supposed to have anymore overtime.  Goddess.. make stupid hurt.  My partner is so right, stupid should hurt.  He thinks she's on Adapex withdrawls.  I just wish that evolution would hurry up and weed these dipshits out of the company..  Unfortunately there'd only be like 5 or 6 of us to run like.. eight cities..  Oh well.  We'd have job security.. and we could take turns wearing a pointy hat and being the "lead-urh".

      Today I became glad that my job description is  not  "Give individual cup to pee in, pour pee in little tubes, mail, repeat." One word. Ewwww.  &nbsp; I had to have the above three for my new part time job. Apparently a "Job Performance Test" where they make you do a bunch of dumb crap thats "related" to your job is required even though you've been doing said job elsewhere for  four miserable goddess forsaken years!    &nbsp; (silence) &nbsp; Okay. Over it. &nbsp; Thankfully my partner at work is a liar. He said the doctor would stick his finger up my butthole and grab my nuts, hopefully not at the same time. That would be awkward. This doctor was a D.O. after my own heart who was  not  a nut-grabber or a butt-fingerer. The only time I want to deal with the butt is my required rotation in Proctology or giving diazepam rectaly. Then all patients must be under 30, be attractive, smell okay&nbsp;and be&nbsp;in great shape. I've got&nbsp;2 out of&nbsp;4 but I don't plan on putting anything up my butt so its okay. Basically, no skanky smelly fat ugly geriatric people. &nbsp; In other news.. my cat stinks... make that cats. Tonight is kitty cat bath night. Yay! I hope the neighbors have their earplugs in since I was holding Salem this morning while putting detergent in the wash.. he was yowling like I was sitting on him.  &nbsp; Dumb cat.

        Have you seen this girl?  &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;       &nbsp;  Taking away from the fun of my posts, I put this up in all seriousness. We know that she is an adult but she is still a friend we are very much worried about, she got dressed one morning and just disapeared. She was last believed to be in Columbus, Ohio and she answers to the name of Bekah.  &nbsp;  If you see her please e-mail me at jmedic148@aol.com, and if you see her please tell her that her EMT friends Josh and Jennie miss her very dearly and wish her to come home as do the rest of her former co-workers.      &nbsp;

      Here we go again.  &nbsp;  The start of another mandatory meeting at my station. Like always it proves that I truly love my job or else I wouldn't bother with this moronic company I work for. I wait for the day that I become a D.O. for I shall work in the E.R. and systematicaly commit all of management to .. lets say Bellvue. Yes I realize that's in New York. I'm hoping that if we crews continue on our present course that eventually management will be helpless and therefore it will be no easier for them to find their way back than it is for my patients to get away from needles. But what do you expect when your job description is "Strap a person down, stick with sharp object, repeat."  &nbsp;  Of course this meeting went its standard route. "I'll fire you all. Blah blah. Suspension. If you make me lose my job I'll shoot you. Blah blah." Then our "dispatch manager," if you say it really fast it sounds like "dick scratcher" which is pretty much HER job description, starts going off on her little tyrade to her "chosen ones." Little does she know we crews have infiltrated her little Inner Circle. She begins yelling. Again. Then we hear. "Its not any trouble for them. Its not like these crews do anything anyway."  &nbsp;  Silence&nbsp;happened. Well. Except for her mouth, the cricket that tried to chirp got sucked in. This was news. Getting up at 0300 to go do an out of town trip or a stupid little local discharge must be a figment of our imaginations. Mass hallucination when she gives us all trips to go do or screams at us to go outside and clean our trucks, for the tenth time that day, because some big-wig who never shows up is "coming." I think it gets her wet or something, because usually she's got the washing machine on spin when this is happening. My question is this. If I don't do anything, then why does this chick dispatch us all while she's sleeping? Logic only serves to follow that if WE don't do anything then neither does she because she has to do something for us to do something, so if we're not doing anything its her fault for not sending us.  &nbsp;  This only serves to back up my conclusion that we need Zoloft dropped into the water supply.  &nbsp;  I love my job.   I love my job.  &nbsp;  I love giving&nbsp;handjobs..  &nbsp;  oh..  &nbsp;  wait..  &nbsp;  I think I was channeling her spirit while I slept.

      Here I sit on the verge of moving from my little ambulance to my little table in Pre-Med at the local college, typing out my first post to this little blog. I believe I have reached a new level in stress from work when I'm now sitting here typing my thoughts like this, while some people reach "Nirvana" I have reached "Pathetica."   And not to get off the subject but what in the crap is up with people on AOL? Do I go messaging people with porn links to fake webcams with stupid names like "MeganLuvz298947469"? No. I don't. I swear to the Goddess the next fool that does that is going to get an earfull. I have a six speed shit filter and at the moment I require a nine.  Anyway.  What do I put here about my unetertaining "Pathetica" life? The fact I'm considering bankruptcy because I'm an idiot when I have a credit card? (Yes Mom, I should have listened to you, I know.) Or the fact that I really.. really.. really have begun to hate where I work. I used to think mainstream religion had the biggest bunch of hippocrites but this ambulance service I work for gives them a run for their money.  Speaking of bankruptcy whats up with the creditor calls? You know I have asthma medication to buy, cats to feed, a fiance' to buy bubble bath for.. if I haven't paid in the past four months and you're telling me my minimum payment is $700 and I only make $1000 in two weeks times three credit cards do you really think I'm going to pay you because you call every two hours? Screw that my phone has a volume control and I have a lawyer. I've learned my lesson, I'll suffer 7 years of poverty before I'm a rich doctor, then I'll laugh in your faces.. sort of like i'm doing now. Ha. Ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha. Ha.
