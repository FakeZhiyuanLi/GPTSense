       On Bubb Rubb and Woo Woo.....  To fully grasp the wonderful bit of comedy that is Bubb Rubb and Woo Woo, you must first watch a little  urlLink News Clip  from Oakland.  After you watch the clip, go directly to the  urlLink Bubb Rubb  site and mix it up for yourself.....let me know what you think...I wasted like 20 minutes playing around with it....enjoy!

       On Spelling....  I feel as though my lack of spelling skills is due to 2 major contributing factors..... 1.  I was raised on spell checker (some of you older folks may not be able to apprecaite this one, but hey, you're old and set in your ways). 2.  I am trying to articulate so much, so quickly, that I simply don't notice that level of deatil......strange for a Virgo...huh?  In the event that you notice a grammer or spelling error, please hold your fucken breath until you hit the floor.  Thank you for your support.

       On Drugs....  Other than the fact that I do actually spend some time on drugs, my intent is more to bitch about how it can be a pain in the ass to actually GET on drugs.  Me n my main squeeze were tryin to get the eagle to land as it has many times in the past without incident.....this time, was different.  Usually, the eagle lands with the timing and smooth style of an 35 year old whop walking into a cheerleading camp, but this time our eagle had....well, it had its wings clipped, and what follows are the trials and perils of getting the eagle to land in the land of the wicked.   5:15: The escape  With the eagle on my mind (as it has been for a couple of days) I slip out of work like a ninja in the dark....my destination.....the bravo extraction point...my mission....to attain the eagle.   5:45 The Dirt Bike Kid  So, with my mind contently resting on the eagle, I proceed with my mission...heading due north...making good time (on the motorcycle so traffic couldn't stop this ninja) when the Dirk Bike Kid enters.  There was an eruption of sound and vibration coming from my pocket (no, I wasn't getting horney) that failed to stop.  I pulled over I was so distracted....to my surprise, it was the dirt bike kid going fucken crazy bout how I had to call him STAT.....this doesn't bode well as I am on a mission of the ut most importance......   5:47 Indecent proposal  After a bit of fumbling around, I was able to get to the bottom of the Dirt Bike Kid's agenda.....he needed a helping hand in moving some shit out of his girlfriend's house.  As you can imagine, this goes against every fiber of my mission, and even more fucked up, its the last damn thing on earth I felt like doing....but, being the push over that I am, I opted to help my homie in need....I figure....what goes around comes around...if I help this guy...the eagle is sure to land!   7:00 The bullshit has gone on long enough  Upon completing of the deed (moving big shit from girls house to second story storage level unit.  Argh!), the gory details of which I will spare you, I had a dry mouth, a headache, and no eagle in sight.   7:45 The realization  Realizing that we may have to spend our labor day weekend in an eagle vacuum, panic set in.  My mind wanders to the possibility that I may need to circumvent normal eagle protocol, and try something "outside the box" to fix this bind!  Allz I can say is, thank God for the quick thinking mind of a little lovely named Don Hollironi...The don pool resources...phone callz were made.....and shit was happening.....we were on the trail of an eagle landing....fucken finally!!!   9:30 We gotta go where?  So, our new eagle landing required some re-allocation of manpower...to make this happen, one ninja had to do some flying, magic babysitting whilst ninja #2 took the mole to the landing strip, which was ass far, and took all kindz of time....   10:30 Back to base  After all the bullshit...all the hoops....the eagle had finally landed.....allz I can say is....fucken A.  So that's my story......long...drawn....but true....and man...it was worth it!

       On Parents.....  Yesterday I had a conversation with my father.  My dad is a man who is so out of touch with himself, that he has his head burried up his ass when it comes to how he feels, and his past.  Here is a man (who I can not relate to, and furthermore, he cannot relate to me), bitching to me about how is father is "unreachable" and "disconnected" and he expressed how that made him feel sad, and frustrated.  I found this to be quite ironic, because here is a man, faulting his own father for "being an island" and unreachable, and telling it to a person (me) with which he has never had a real connection with.  When I asked my father why he doesn't speak to his dad ("Joe the bad" for those who don't know of him), he simply stated that "God has given me the ability to forgive my father".  It is funny, because in the same conversation he indicated that it was in fact an issue, and he cannot draw the line between forgiving someone, and getting closure on an issue you have with somone.  Perhaps, this blur on his part is what prevents us from having any manner of meaningful relationship (I have daddy issues).  Any way, it was a real eye opener....I feel like I have grown further than he ever will!  I tried to illustarte to him that while he is bitching that his father is a "closed" person, he is the same in relation to me.  He is so afraid to talk about things....its funny, cause here my dad was this intimidating person growing up...such a bully....and here I sit as an adult...realizing that....he was never anything but a paper dragon!  Oh how insight sets us free.....Dad....I forgive ya.....shit......I feel bad for you......

       On Taking Vacation time....  It has taken me a good 5 years of chasing my own tail to realize that I wasn't hitting the furthest point on my production possibilities frontier with reagrds to time away from work.  In the past, I would accumulate as many vacation days as possible, with hopes to take one long vacation (yeah right), or that I would get a nice bonus when I leave the company.....well fellow blogga fuckas, I'm done with that shit!  When the company gives me a day off, I show that I'm no pussey by requesting an extra day off in addition to the one given to me....this method of matching days has increased my ability to be away from work, whilst not pissing off the management.  I highly recommend this method office avoidance....you come off smelling like a rose in that you are still the "Company Man" with the best interests of some fucken corporation in mind (because shouldnt entities get compassion too?), while you selfishly live your own life like a person who puts themselves first.  What a concept!

       Getting Older......  So, you know you're getting older when the child you used to change the diapers on is on his way to college.  My little bro-ham David (the famous renasance painter) has packed his pipe, and headed north to the  urlLink Colorado State University .  Damn....used to wipe ointment on his nuts whilst changing his diapers, and now hez all growz up.....   Random side note.....  As if the smell of baby powder lingering in your mind isn't enough to make you feel like an old geezer....try going for a run on a Monday...that'll make you feel pretty fucken old too man.

       On Good, Clean Fun...  Somthing I've noticed as I've gotten older is how dependant adults are on booze to make their social activities.....memorable.  I was speaking to a co-worker today, and they told me that they have been drinking too much as of late, so they didn't want to hang out this evening.  When I asked this person what social activities friends can do that didn't involve drinking or exercise, they could only come up with some gurlie activities (shopping, talking about boys, etc..)!    Think about it....when was the last time one of your buddies called you and asked you over for a tall glass of milk while you watch the game?  When was the last time someone asked you out for a fucken smoothie or an ice cream after a long day of work?  So bloga fuckas, I ask you this.....what the hell is a dood to do when he wants to be social, but not drink?  Where do you go?  What do you do?

       On Paperwork...  So, poop stories aren't really my bag, but I gotta share this.  I have this buddy, and we'll call him The Mad Shitter (aka Harvester of Sorrow) for the sake of this conversation....so he comes over after the Broncos lay waste to the Raiders (yay! fuck the raiders) to smizzle a bizzle before he goes home...which is fine with me....but here is where shit goes south.  The Mad Shitter indicates that he has to drop the kids off at the pool (who the fuck shits at 11:00 pm??) and with no shame goes into the community restroom while my girlfriend n cousin are sitting there and totally droppes bombs!  He comes out looking guily....I question him: E: dood, did you turn on the fucken fan? D: yeah man. E: you better have left the door closed! D: i did....  I am comfortable with the damage control, so I drop it....... Yeah..... So I wake up this morning, and my cousin tells me that the Mad Shitter fucken shit on the seat!  Now tell me how that is fucken possible????  This guy is 26 years old by the way, so don't go thinking that I get hight with children, and he doesn't know how to control the beast that is his ass!  My cousin had to treat my house like a porta-potty, because this gross-assed, non-aiming, shit slinging muther fucker crapped on my toilet seat!  Mad Shitter......you need to work on that bro....doesn't bode well with the chicks....or doods, or animals, ect....

       On frustration...  No I don't mean sexual frustration, I mean the frustration of being informed of a tee time 20 minutes prior to tee off, and not having your golf clubs.  You see, this creates a fucken logistics nightmare in that my teleporting device is in the shop, my flex compacator is down, and my car is low on blinker fluid, so clearly I cannot chose the wine in front of me.  If only i could mount somthing on my motorcycle that would allow me to carry the clubs.....wouldn't that impress all the chicks!  That's one solution...another is....if the fuckn harvestor of sorrow would just ping me say.....45 minutes before tee time, it would be a non-issue.  Cock-ass!

       On Being Jerked....  There is nothing more frustrating than being jerked in several directions, at the same time (well, not all jerking about is bad...), by different agnedas.  I find myself in a situation where I will make consessions, bend over backwards, dismiss my agneda, and in the end, I still will have failed.  Why do I allow this type of situation to exist?  How do I not see it coming?  Why do I do nothing to avoid it?   My life as a tour guide  Starring Ben Dover and Phil MaCavity

       On Crying like a baby......  Before this very moment, it has been a while since I have last cried.  I just got a letter from my mother, which she sends every year around my b-day, which moved me in a way i cannot paraphrase, so I will reinterate it word for word....it goes as follows:  Thank you for twenty-seven years incredible, magnificent, joy filled years of being blessed with the pride and pleasure of being your Mom.  I've loved every second.  I have a life time of treasured memories from the moment I first held you on up throughout your life.  Your home coming was on september 9th, three days old.  Your first night home we slept on your bedroom floor because I didn't want you so far down the hall.  The next day we borrowed a tiny crib from Rick Marshall and you spent your nights at my side for months.  It was a thrill on the evening of january 28, 1977 when your first tooth appeared at four months.  I promptly called everyone to share the news. (it all fits that I brag about the fairytale life you have created for yourself now.)  You had a large collection of words at 1 and spoke in clear sentences at fifteen months.  Sitting at 6 months, walking at ten months, dancing at eleven months, jumping on the bed and wanting a motorcycle at twenty-two months (Ahhh, who can mess with that long range goal!)  You had fun chasing Yvonne, the dog, and playing with your first friends at the age of one, Jason, Laura, and Mary Melinda House.  At two and a half, your sense of humor captivated people and made them laugh.  You called yourself the "Baseball Kid" and loved to play and dress the part.  We played baseball in our hallway at 13 months.  You sported a diaper and a baseball cap as you smaked the ball, threw your plastic bat, and ran through the kitchen, dining room, living room, and safely back to home plate for a big score.  At three you were playing in the neighborhood park in a Bonita Springs uniform that Nanny gave you.  Your first big college football game was Michigan vs Wisconsin on November 3, 1979 at the age of three.  The "Big Boy" outing with just you and your dad impressed you more than the 54 to 0 score U of M won with.  At five, you were the big brother of two and on top of your world.  You enjoyed everything and everyone.  You learned to ride your bike at five and a half on June 12, 1982.  With each experience and moment came more joy and love than I could ever have imagined.  Your swimming accomplishments were impressive.  Your hard work and long hours earned you sixth place in Colorado at the age of ten.  My favorite part of your swimming career was begging you to jump off the diving board for the first time.  I encouraged and promised you anything you wanted if you'd jump in.  All the time i was praying you would not ask me to show you how!  After hours you took your first plunge and you've been unstoppable since.  At twelve you crossed the finish line of your first one mile Fun Run Race wearing the number 5 on it.  Your thoughtfulness, brains, creativity, sense of humor, and sense of adventure has given me the times of my life.  You are an incredible Son, and an awesome brother.  Your loving and powerful example along with your strong sense of family has made being a single Mom possible and a pleasure.  Each of us is blessed because of you Eric.  Happy Birthday Son.  I have enjoyed your childhood and I am proud of the man you have become.  Your greatness in all you do is a consistant marvel and joy for me.  I thank God for you and who you are.  Eric William Haller, God smiled the day you were born Son and I'be beamed with joy and happiness everyday since! Eric - Ever powerful and ever ruler William - Resolute protector Born Monday September 6, 1976 Labor Day @ 2:28 PM. 8 pounds 15 oz.  23 in long.  Happy Birthday my Son! I'll love you forever.... Like you for always.... forever my baby you'll be!  With all my love and admiration..... Mom xOxOxO   Now, that is a tribute....I don't even know what to say but this..... If you think I am bold, it is because she was so strong. If you feel I've loved you, she taught me to love by showing that she loved me. If you think I am a family man, it is because she taught me to be through the endless sacrifices she made for our little family. If you think I am sensitive, it is because she cared about me so much, and was so attentive, that I cannot help but be the same. If you think I am empowering, it is because she was always on my side encouraging me to press on. If you think I am touch with my femine side, it is because all I had to teach me how to be a man, was a wonderful woman.  I don't believe anyone has said such nice things to me ever.  If half of what she said is true, I have already justified my time here....I just feel so lucky to have had such a sterling example in my life, of what a beautiful person is....Mom.....I love you....and thank you for raising me to be me...you didn't cut any corners...even if it came at your expense.  No regrets, No consessions, No shit!  Wow...now that's impressive.....take a bow girl....you've made somthing great......and you made me, cry like a baby!

       On waking up early...  What the fuck?  They say the early bird gets the worm...well, that may be, but unless you are a fisherman, who fucken cares?  The early bird is busy dicking around with worms, whilst the party animal is in a deep sleep dreaming of the previous night's festivities.  In the evening, when the "early bird" is soaking their dentures and roosting, the party animal is sharpening his wit, and heading out for the booty (in the treasure sense of the word of course).  As for me and my house, I say fuck worms, and fuck getting up early....it's not like Good Morning America offers any compelling content worth being up for anyway!  Damn I tired......

As if loosing whatever data isn't bad enough...MS now has its apps ask you if you want to send an "error report" to microsoft....well....for my level of agro-high-strungedness, I need a little button that says..."Send piping hot pile of shit to Microsoft?"

       On Camping...  Ohhhh gosh I love to camp!  It's more than finding dirt in places that you never knew existed...its all about the scenery.  This last weekend I had the pleasure of camping at  urlLink Big Basin , which is a really nice place to camp.  There were tons of redwood trees to relax under, plenty of beer to drink...and about 6 powder-sugared "hills" to stare at!  I have always been a "hill" guy...in fact...if a forest has nice "hills", but not much else to offer, I can still see the good in it!  Seeing these hills makes a man glad that he is a man!  I bet I could see way down the valley from the top of those hills.

       On the California Recall election...  Ok.....i can't keep my mouth shut on this issue any more.  So I live in a fucken state full of indecisive assholes!  In California, prison guards get raises, road construction stops, and books get ripped out of the hands of children all in the name of a shortage of money.  How does this progressive, forerunning state respond?  Hey, lets spend hundres of millions of dollars on a fucken recall election so that we can clearly decide once and for all which is better....herpies or the clap?????  I'm soo fucken pissed about this....I couldn't imagine if I had kids going to school here, cause then I might go fucken postal!  As I drive back to work from the gym, my favorite radio staion (810 KGO AM) informs me that people all around the state are bitching because the election that should have been blocked by the surpreme court, is not going very smooth.  There missing ballots, broken machines, lack of privacy, and a slew of other issues preventing these idiots from reiterating their choice for head douche bag!  California people....I laugh at you!  I will not participate in your frivilous spending of precious resources by voting in your unnecessary election!  Fucken hippies!  Arnold for office!

       On Getting Blown...  So, I do spend a fair amount of time in gym locker rooms, in which many strange things go on.  Today, I want to share with you, a story about a man, we'll call him snake for the sake of conversation, who may have the biggest dick I've ever noticed!  Why am I so well informed as to this man's endowment?  Because he has a hand-dryer fettish!  Snake has to be in his mid sixties.  This dood will come out of the shower, towel dry himself for a good 10 minutes...and then....this is the great part....he goes over to the hand dryer, turns the spout so that it faces up, and proceeds to stand there for a good 4 cycles of the dryer.....playing with his junk!  Now, like everyone else in the locker room...I just pay attention to my business, but man, its hard to ignore an old man in the corner, fanning his ginormous package over a hand dryer for 10 minutes.  I had to see it....just sharing my pain.

       On being gay to yourself...  I am a big fan of the Fab 5 (Queer Eye for the Straight Guy crew for those who haven't had the pleasure) and am learning quite a bit from them.  One interesting notion that they introduced me to is being more "gay" to myself.  They point out how men typically wash by scrubbing relentlessly like they are sanding a deck, and when they shampoo, they mash the product into their scalps like they're trying to rip open their skull.....well not any more my friends, at least, not for me!  I'm working on being more gay to myself.  I'm now messaging my hair product into my scalp.  I gently lather the soap.  I gave myself a fucken pedicure for crying out loud!  What does all this mean.....I guess I'm trying to pamper myself.....fucken odd feeling....but being an androgynous male, I'm comfy with the notion of self-pampering....which females have practiced since...well...forever.  So guys, doods, amigos.....trust me....be a little more gay to yourself....in then end....you'll have soft...glowing skin, soft feet, and a new appreciation for self-pampering!

       On BUI (blogging under the influence)...  If there is such a thing as a professional drinker, i'm proud to say that I know a couple of them personally (you know who you are)!  That being said, I feel it is also important to mention that I too feel as though I am qualified to be a professional drinker.  Tonight, laides and gents, was a stellar performance.  Not only did the drinker (me) show passion for the drink, he showed that one must drizzle the jizzle n cizzle tizzle their hizzle spizzles in circizzles.  If it were a contest......allz i know is....the match was mine!  Laides and Gentlemen, the captian has illuminated the fasten seat-belt sign as we are beginning our final approach for landing.  Please return your seats and trade-tables to their original position..........Please remain seated until the aricraft has come to a complete stop at the terminal and the capitan has truned off the fasten seat-belt sign.  Be careful when accessing the over-head bins as thier contents may have shifted during the flight.  Because we know here at e-airlines that you have a choice when you travel, we would like to thank you for choosing us.....enjoy your stay and have a nice day!

       On company xmas parties...  So I had my company xmas party last night....it was at the Agenda (place where the young and pretty people hang out...not me) which is this kinda night clubby thing....anyway....the people I work with have come to expect me to get into fine form at these types of events.....given that i have a people pleasing mentality.....i didn't let them down!  I arrived by taxi....with 4 other drunk ass foolz.  Our cabby was the coolest dood...too many people for the seat belts...we all had booze in us and with us and he let us have full control of the radio!!!!!  This man is truly a pirate after my own heart.  So the xmas party feels like it lasted about 5 minutes.........we get there.....and the next thing i know...all my co workers had bugged out and it was my drunk ass dancin on the empty dance floor (this happens often).  After the gig, I meet up with a few peeps at the my apartment...few bowls later, we decide that 12:00 on a school night is no time to quit....cause quittinz for pussies!  That said...we were off to my local watering hole.  We close the place down haven gotten even more drunk....by now....i could sell my piss as Jack Daniels.  I must of had a "cute night" because one chick gave me her card (would never call her but it feelz good to be hit on for sure) and another chick had me back to her car for a biznowl with her brother (who i had to assure that I didn't want into his sister's pants....which is a true statement.......he was drunk n volitole).  By now its 2 am....i'm alll kinds of fucked up....walkn home....a buddy i'm hanging with tackles my ass....on my back.....both legs get folded under me...all you hear is a big crunch...both knees....fucked!  Of course....i lay an ass whooping....but i wasn't able to stand for a few minutes.....  So after some more bowlz and some madden.....its 3:30 on a thursday....and its time for bed.  I'm so sore today....kness so fucked up...feel like an old man.....head is spinning.....i'm sure my company's stock will go up today on account of my productivity alone!  ;o)

       On Dealing with Loss...  As i've mentioned, my Grandmother passed away yesterday.  Because this is the first "close" death in the family, I really didn't have an established method of mourning.  I thought that the best way to honor my grandmother's life and death was to live yesterday to its maximum potential and to celibrate it!  Here is what I came up with:  Drove to San Francisco....saw the bay...saw the ocean.....saw the city scape...enjoyed my ability to see.  Went for a long walk...smelled the air....watched people hustle around...slowed down enough to enjoy everyday life and routine.  Went for a 8 mile run.....enjoyed my health ( and did it in a personal best time!).  Smoked a big 'J'.....enjoyed my ability to roll like a cuban.  Made a really fancy dinner......enjoyed my ability to cook and spoiled my senses.  Learned a couple of songs on the guitar....enjoyed my ability to be musical.  Hung out with close friends.....enjoyed others who are on this journey with me.  I feel that my grandma would have been happy with the way I spent my day because it was all about enjoying where you're at, when you're there.....you never know when it's gonna be time to move on!

       On Lucile...  This morning....Lucile Garish, my grandma, passed away.  Makes me sad that shez gone.  She is the first grandparent that i've lost, and i just can't believe that she is gone!  I didn't get to see her often, as she lived in Detroit, but never the less she is someone whom I have known my whole life.  She was in pain in the end, which makes me sad..but I'm happy that she is suffering no more......She'll be missed by many people.  On a lighter note...looks like my father's pre-planning of the funeral paid off for him....she did't make it till Sunday.....morbid.

       On Drama Queens...  So, my father, Lord Vador, is the biggest drama queen on earth.  Here is a man who wont even take a shit unless it is to be a dramatic shit!  Right now, my family is coping with my Grandma (She who begat vador) who is in late stages of cancer....she has days to live.  My father, who never gave a shit about me or my relationship with his mother is now all concered that i'll miss her funeral.  He wouldn't fly me out there to see her before she moves on, but by golly he stands by her hospital bed (for her benifit i guess?) and makes fucken funeral arrangements and graciously offers to fly me out so that I can see them put her into the ground.  Now I know I've used this venue to bitch about my sperm doner in the past, and I don't want you all to think i'm trying to cop some free therapy...but man i just have to say......  Little billy.....you're a fucken drama queen, and your priorities are all fucked up!

       On Breaking the Silence...  When you got a big mouth...you can only keep it shut for so long.  I'm making a diligent effort to not get delisted here.  A wise man once said....the angle of the dangle is equal and proportionate to the mass of the ass.....well....i say bullshit.  My ass mass is shrinking, and yet my dangle dangles at the same angle.  I may need more updated equipment to properly measure the angle of the dangle......some manner of laser technology.   Manscaping itches....not so much in the croch reigon, but more so on the chest.  My new apartment smells like grandma's cookies.

       On Pavement...  So yesterday I was on my way back to work from the gym (I swim on Tuesdayz n Thursdayz) driving like speed racer like I do.  This little man on a crotch rocket pulls out in front of me and hits the gas so I don't have to slow down......that's about the time things started to move in slow motion...  The jockey's (little man on a big motorcycle) back tire looses traction...and I see his bike go down!  He slid and rolled for about 150 feet.  His bike was tumbling and bucking.....I couldn't believe my eyes!  I slammed on my brakes so I wouldn't run over this guy.  I got out to help him...got him and his bike to the side of the road....brand new bike...new rider.  He walked away, but man....being someone who has a motorcycle (cruiser) it just made me think.  All those times I've ridden in shorts an a t-shirt with my skull helmet on....how lucky-stupid of me.  I am resolving myself to always wear my body armor, and to get a new helm which covers my face (since that dood ended up face down...if that were me....i'd be lookin pretty Rockey Dennis).  I'm glad that kids is okay...just shook up....out a bike....and up a few cuts and bruises.

       On Seagulls and Soy milk...  Since my nizzo Jwump is too busy taking it in the ass at work to bitch about his boss....and it isn't uncommon that he shares his pain with me...I feel I am qualified to bitch in proxy of Jwump.  The Seagull.......  Works very few hours   Spawned a mini-hippy   Likes...body hair....her body hair....hence she never removes it   Is passive aggressive   Says things like "If you could go ahead and _______ that'd be great...thanks"   Lactates Soy milk   Hates plants so much that it's all she'll eat.  (I don't eat meat cause i'm not into flesh)   Says she loves the Earth, but drives a car that needs to stop at weight stations   Makes more than shez worth   Likes to offload her responsibilities on Jwump   In summary....shes like.....well.....my boss......minus the lactating of course.

       On Speed Racer...  Many people maintain that when traffic is thick...you should just get in line and wait your turn.  I used to be a practitioner of this philosophy....until this morning!  Racers....start your engines......  There is a ginormous line of cars to get onto the 17......I'm not feeling it.......I've been driving really aggressive lately (because I should be going to a therapist to express my anger) and this was no exception!  Racers....get the fuck out of the Ez way!  I find a woman who is putting on her eye makeup....not paying any attention...she is at the front of the line.....I cut her off!  I feel bad and good all at the same time.....I can't help but gloat by staring at her in my rear view mirror with a shit eating grin on my face!  The lady isn't even phase by my dick move....she continues to not pay attention and finish applying her war paint!  Nothing like a little competitive spirit and the taste of victory to start your day!  I had a stellar commute!

       On pubs that are more like high schoolz...  This weekend I met a couple of good friends at a pub for some beers in Mountain View.....The place is called Molly Magee's.  This has been a watering hole of this group of people for God knows how long...and ya know what.....I just can't figure out why they even go there!  While there this weekend standing out on the back patio.....quickly approaching death because everyone and their mom is smoking cigs.....chain style......I gasp for some fresh air and some suds.....our little party is abruptly interrupted by some bouncer asshole (who did't even look 21) who informed us that wearing our hats backwards made us gang related.....now ..... i'm sure this asshole had no idea he was talking to an accountant and a engineer (the most dangerous of gangstas) otherwise he'd have shown a lil more respect....the best part...my accountant Jwumpy friend was all fired up and Jack n Coke so he got lippy...was great to see.....we left.  A side note...not only do these assholes tell you how to wear a hat, they make you take a fucken pass to get to and from the bathroom.....I plan on never going there again......until next time.

So after 8 days of no sleep, more beer than 10 doods should drink, a big tattoo in my armpit, an almost broken leg, a drained checking account, brownies, no patience, broken glass, $1000 worth of sushi, the thought of sharing a bed with a different man every night, and 10 gallons of coffee I can say I survived Haller-boy week!

       &nbsp;&nbsp;   On Epic Adventure...  This holideezie seazie was crazy and epic indeed.....herez how the caper went down.....  12/23/03:  I start my surf trip down the coast by leaving one day early to attend a company xmas party with JR.  This is his company party...not mine....need to clarify that before I tell you how fucken bad it sucked.  This party was for his team....small group of open GL engineers (math geeks).  Needless to say I was bored out of my fucken skull.  I'm usually a social butterfly, but at this party, I cut my losses, sat in the corner....and tried to kill myself by holding my breath.....that's really hard to do.  This affair lasted for 3-fucken-hours!   12/24/03:  OK...finally escaped from the lamest "party" in the history of the world and I wake up refreshed in a Motel 6 in Santa Barbra.....time to surf yet?  Nope.  JR decides that he needs a surf rack for the hippie bus or else the trip will be a wash....so I spend the morning with him shopping for and installing a rack.  While this is happening...I see some dood trying to steal a jacket from a surf shop.....2 teen age employees running after his ass.  Now I ask this....If i'm gonna steal something...i'm not going to do it from a store full of angry teens who are in great shape....needless to say the kids caught him and got the merch back.  Finally in the afternoon, I get my first surf on at Rancon beech.  A dolphin surfaces about 5 yards away from me....I almost shit myself cause being from NoCal....I think its a fucken shark!  The dood next to me cracks up and tells me to get a grip.....doh!  I get rolled here for the first time in a while.  Paddle into a wave...find myself 10 feet in the air...surf board perls....i go under....and stay under.....have a life flash....feel a rock.....next thing i know....i finally surface...nothing like getting rolled to get you in the mood!   12/25/03:  Merry xmas!  Me n JR get to his brother Charles house in wonderful LA.  Xmas in LA is like Xmas in hell.  These people don't believe in anything!  No lights....no trees....no little creep gnomes making toys for good kids....just a bunch of neat guys.  Now Charles is pretty much one of the coolest doods i've met...really cool....also some manner of Yogi (yoga rock star of sorts).  Spent xmas with him...the excentric neighbor downstaris named Siri Sat Nam....took me days to remember that shit.  He was cool n crazy....when he calls someone and they answer the phone he says...."it is I"....just to give you an idea.   12/26/03:  Head up the caost from LA to Malibu to get some more surf on.  Malibu had one of the best breaks we found.  Had a good time surfing....met some strage chick from bay area.....most depressed person i've ever met....fuck her!  We goto a camp ground....and rough it....(watch something about mary on a laptop...hey....of course we brougt a computer....we're nerds!)   12/27/03:  Back to Santa Barbra for more surfing.  Had a great morning surf.  We hang out in town....watchn at the skate park....2 kids are in a 2 seated bike like contraption....both with joints hanging out of thier mouthes take this thing down a ramp and crash it......funnest shit i saw all day.  They pick up the bike, and ride off before the skate park rangers bust they asses.  We go out.....get drunk.....I flatten JRz tire.....we fight....been too many dayz in the saddle i guess....we decide it is time to head north.   12/28/03:  Despite being hindered by all kinds of bullshit....we finally make it home!  I need to sleep off all the booze!  Day of rest.   12/29/03:  Back in the saddle again....me n Jwimp Daddy Cain head up to the city for an epic man-date.  We get a hotel (they only gave us 1 bed......its a queen....we spoon) and go out and drink like a fucken rock band!   12/30/03:  Back to Campbell....get a buch of dood to rally and we go out to Boswells.....again...get drunk like sailors.  On the walk home from the bar...i decide that it is a good idea to climb to the top of a bus stop.....i fall......i have bruises the size of small children all over my legs....i cant run for a wile.....and my knee is swollen to the size of a fucken mellon...no shit!   12/31/03:  No rest for the wicked....meet up with the  crew in down town sunnyvale....the madness continues!  Again getting wasted and dancing alone (we've discussed this in the past) we bring in 04.  Does the fun stop here?  Fuck no...me n the Dirt Bike Kid hop in his car at 1:00 am and drive to Tahoe!  Hey...why not.   1/1/04 - 1/3/04:  This is like 1 long day with no clear details....alphas or omegas....just blur of drinking....mease monkey would be proud!   So much happened.....and now that its all over......i'm beat up....tired....my neighbor's dog is pregnant and i walk with a limp....epic i tell you!

(i know i know...me n my therapist are working on it)  Usually, if he sends me a gift at all, he sends me some manner of religious material...you know...since i'm not into it at all....well...one good turn deserves another......I'm gonna send him a 1/4 of weed...

       Rant List...  So, I'm usually not such a negative person (actually can't stand negative people), but lately life is handing me a healthy serving of SHIT.  SO, herez my list:  Bill-do, my failure of a father want me to drop a G ($1000) to come to his mother's ash spreading.  He give me no details as to where I'm going (south Haven MI), no details on airports, doesn't know when the service is, and wont return my calls.....beatdown for him.    Some Neanderthal dick head at work pisses on the fucken toilet seat and doesn't mandle his mess.  Either: 1.  Piss in the fucken urinal 2.  Sit down and piss like a girl 3.  Clean up your fucken mess!    A bunch of work for a roll out I have this afternoon got deleted and I'm in scramble mode trying to get it back.

       Turn offs...  Okay, there are many turn offs, but carnal sins are the following: 1.  Don't ever fucken hang up on me. 2.  Don't ever fucken walk away from me.  If you are a dood, and commit one of the above mentioned offenses, you deserve a beatdown.  If you're a girl and are an offender....NO MORE DATES! (and if there are, you're paying!)  Both of these things happened to me last night!  I was so pissed I drank a bottle of wine for EACH sin committed.  I was so drunk I actually forgave the person!  Full forgiveness wasn't attained though until me n my buddy H.O.S. (Harvester of Sorrow) hit up a mid-day round of golf.  Hot as fuck...shot a 101 but got a great tan.  On a lighter note, tricky me has taken Friday and Tuesday off.  5 for the price of 2.  Look for me on the golf course, by the pool, or at the skate park!  Whoo hoo!

On a lighter note, at lunch I was on the horn with my buddy Bobby Splode and I was getting cut off by 2 Asian drivers in a 30 second time span.

       On Ninja's, 40z, and the like...  So last night I met up with my blokes.  I couldn't meet up with them until later as I have a very complex social life.  I get there and they're all a 40 oz and some change of the Magnum ahead of me.  This is code for: They were shit canned.  Evidently while on a mission to get me a 40 while i'm en route, Lars took a spill into a puddle of mud.  His clothes are filthy, his ego damaged, and his wrist hurt, he still accomplishes the mission of 40 attainment.  The night goes on with more drinking, and dicking around.  Now, one thing you have to know about Lars....the more he drinks, the more he insists on practicing his Te Kwon Do.  This doods all over the shit.  Drunken master sitting there with a 40 in hand, eyes half open and doing his ninja moves.  God bless ya Lars!

       On Perfection...  Now, you'll never hear me describing myself and use the word perfect....with one exception.  I have a perfect right eyebrow.  This is not my opinion, but one of a professional.  My barber lady performs many services and one of them being eyebrow plucking.  She asks me if I want my eyebrows plucked.  Being a man of adventure and one who backs from no challenge, I tell her to have at it.  She gets in my face....Tweezers in hand....looks closely and plucks a single hair from my left eyebrow.  She then shifts focus to my right eyebrow...the frown quickly turns into a smile and she say..."that's all".  I say, what do you mean that's all?  You plucked 1 hair from my left eye, and left my right eye brow out in the cold!  She replies, "no I didn't....it's perfect!" "Perfect?" I reply.  "Perfect" she says.  "Fucken A" is all i could think of.  I gave her a hug and a $10 tip.  She made my friggen day.  So there you have it people...i'm in possession of 1 perfect eyebrow.

I wake up this morning in a pool of sweat...fever is gone, and I'm feeling like $678,912.33 (a million bucks after taxes). 2.  Talking to my mom Curley Sue on the horn, and she tells me the most bizarre thing.  A friend of my mom's that I've know since I was 8 tells her the other day that she has had a crush on me since I was in college.  She asks my mom "Does it bother you that I say that?"  Mom calmly replies "Don't tell Eric that, he'll fuck your brains out!"

       On outsourceing to India...  Okay, we offload some of our less complex engineering tasks to a team in India.  They're greatful for our business...they show this by scheduling 7:00 PM confrence calls.  Here'z my take....  Give me the fucken work and i'll get it done before 6:00 and be home with Miss Pants by 7.  Noooo...i get to sit here until 8:00 on a fucken video conf call and stare at a bunch of people who don't have a clue.   Now that's nice....real nice...yeahhhh....thanks.

       On Miss Pants...  Miss Pants is one of the MANY silly names that I've given my dog Miley (black lab).  She also goes by: 1.  Labradesha (ethnic name) 2.  Senora Pantalones 3.  Piea 4.  Cujo  Anywho, I bring her to work all the time and she just chills in my cube.  I just got props for having such a well behaved dog.  I've arrived.  After so many months of hell, I feel like I've really arrived with her.  What a good girl Miss Pants! (she looks at me like I'm crazy every time)

       On Best Supporting Actor...  This will hopefully be my last post concerning death for a while.  Having 2 deaths hit close to home last week, and drastically affect several people close to me and 2 people REALLY close to me has taken it's toll on me!  I never really thought that being here for my loved ones would kick my ass so hard!  I'm run down, in pain, fucked out, and running on empty.  I need a fucken break man!  I need those good times to ROLL!

       On having enough...  I've had enough.  Last week, I lost a co-worker...young...unexpected.  This last weekend, my good buddy Harvester of Sorrow's father passed away.  I was just in his wedding, and had the opportunity to spend some time with him.  Actually have a bit of a funny story.  The groom's men and groom are getting ready for the wedding.  Now, when you're gettin ready to put on a tux...even if you're not usually Mr. Style...you expect that you'll look pretty good.  So, we're getting all dicked up...and as i'm puttin on my tux...i'm thinking...shit....have i gained like 50 lbs in the last month or something?????  This fucken tux wouldn't fit a 12 year old.  The sleeves came half way down my arm, and the pants were so short...you could see half way up my calf!  Barry and Peterson are laughing at me because i look like a total tool!  When i try to get the shoes on....they're size 9!  Now, I wear size 14...therez now friggen way i'm getting into those shoes!  So, I'm stressin out...wanting to not goto the wedding...and not be up in front of a crowd in a tux made for a kid.  Barry gets to thinking and realizes that his dad wears size 9.  Maybe they switch tuxes!!!  We get to the country club where the transaction (wedding) is supposed to go down.  I'm wearing my dope ass tiny tux as I wait for Barry's dad to get there with what I hoped would be mine.  When Barry's dad got there...he did in fact have my tux (whew..i'll be in the wedding after all) and we proceed to the nearest men's room.  So there i'm standing with Barry's dad...we're both in black sox and boxer shorts shooting the shit while we switch tuxes...was totally funny...fancy place with 2 naked doods hanging out by the shoe polisher in the men's room.  This was the first time I had a chance to hang out with Harry Brinkerhof Doyle III one on one.  We spoke about life...watching his kids grow up and the like.  He expressed how excited he was to see Barry get hitched, and how proud he was of him.  He was a cool guy, and now more than ever, i cherish the opportunity to stand naked and shoot the shit with him.  Life is so fragile...sometimes...when you think of how fragile and temporary it is...you almost fear reaching out and living it.

       On Dying...  Last night, a beloved man named Brian Winslow passed away.  He was 29 years old and married just 2 weeks ago.  His wife was out of town, so Brain died alone.  He was a popular, kind, fun, well liked person.  Hits close to home.  Recognize the wonders of life every day, because you never know.  Fare thee well.

       The Man-Pill...   So I'm having a conversation with my brother Craig and suddenly the topic of birth control drifts in.&nbsp; After a few moments going back and forth&nbsp;about our opinions on the matter, we begged the question:  Why isn't there a man-pill?   After 2 great minds munged the problem, we came up with this:  If there was a man-pill, then human beings would go extinct.   Why do we think that?  Dood, if there was a man-pill, EVERY GUY WOULD BE ON IT!   Currently, I'm drafting a business proposal, and Craig has enrolled in Chemistry and Biology classes at the university.   Please send me an email if you'd like to pre-order the...... MAN-PILL  "Because Condoms are for Sailors!"

       marriage...   Yesterday I'm hanging out at the Harvester Of Sorrow's house doing what we do.&nbsp; Suddenly, from upstairs his newly wed wife starting yelling downstairs about&nbsp;what's going on some stupid reality show.&nbsp; She shouts for about 2 minutes, the whole time Harvester is busy dicking around with his stereo receiver.&nbsp; Now, I was listening to what she was saying, and if he wanted to even partially pretend that he was listening to what she was saying, he would have responded with a "wow" or "that's gross" but what does H.O.S. respond with?   "OK"   Just made me giggle.&nbsp; Married for a month and already with the dismissive responses.&nbsp; I think they put some kind of depressant in wedding cake.

       Wharf to Wharf   I did my annual wharf to wharf run this weekend from Santa Curz to capitol.&nbsp; As always, a good time.&nbsp; Ran behind a girl in a too too....which is nice.&nbsp; Here are some hightlights from the run:    I get a race number that is gold.&nbsp; Now, I don't know what this means, but I'm the only one I see who has this "golden" number.&nbsp; People keep coming up to me and wishing me good luck and what not...giving me long stares.&nbsp; Turns out that they choose 100 people of the 15,000 to be eligible for a drawing for a trip to HI.&nbsp; I didn't win, but shit, that's the closest thing i've come to winning!  Drank 5 memosas after the race!&nbsp; &nbsp;:o)  Got naked in a parking lot.  Went the wrong way down a 1 way street to save 5 minutes in driving time.&nbsp; (I think i have the road rage)  The Whop came out of hiding.   All in all, was a good time.  &nbsp;  I should also mention that Friday night was one of those nights where i go out and come home with like 10 people who all crash at my house.&nbsp; Friggen party central.&nbsp; I need to start a party email list to give peeps warning in the event that they wanna that they wanna join.  &nbsp;  Have a Monday folks.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       Update From CO...   My brother Kevin the Ultimate wingman called me yesterday and told me 3 things:  &nbsp;    He had his first 3 some with a couple of baby mamas from work.&nbsp; He said it was most amazing.&nbsp; He had been doing this thing where he wouldn't let himself come, but this was a special occasion.&nbsp; He said he blew a "Porn Star Wad".&nbsp; On a side note, Kev had hooked up with a chick my brother Craig liked, and to make right on the situation....Kev shared his girls with Craig.&nbsp; When Kevin asked if they were straight...Criag simply replied..."water under the bridge"  Kevin is out in L. A. this week for a job interview.&nbsp; If he gets it, that'll be 2 nuts in CA.&nbsp; All I can say is you californians lock up your daughters and get more insurance on your house!  Mr. Tom, my late grandma's husband, passed away yesterday.&nbsp; :o(&nbsp; Too much death!   On a side note, I found a bunch of voice recordings from the Chicago trip....soo fucken funny!

       Holy Hang-Over Batman!   So only in the early morning hours of this very morning did the 3 day party in Chicago end.&nbsp; Here are some bullet items that will have to suffice as the record of the event until my memory comes back to me.  &nbsp;  FRIDAY    Trip started with some strange lady drawing me in the airport.&nbsp; Some dood comes up and points her out and says..."dood, that lady is drawing you!"&nbsp; I reply "well, i'm not photogenic so maybe this'll come out better".&nbsp; I never did see the finished product.&nbsp; This was 2 double jack and cokes into the trip.&nbsp; Friday 10 AM.  We sit on the plane (Brad, Dave (the bach) and Me (the e)) for 5 fucken hours before even taking off because the folks at American Airlines are incompetent beyond measure.&nbsp; They lost the fucken gas cap for the plane!!!&nbsp; Unreal.&nbsp; We passed the time drinking a bottle of bubbly that Brad snuk on the plane.&nbsp; After that, we began buying cocktails.&nbsp; There was no more booze on the plane by the time we took off.  We get to Chi-town at 11:00 PM.&nbsp; Sober, tired, frustrated, we meet the Danamil (Dave's brother) at a cozy lil bar in Lincoln park.&nbsp; The only other recollection I have of that evening is Dave and his brother doing a pole dance on stage together, and the Lawyer (good ole Ben) standing there with his nut sack&nbsp;hanging out of his pants (called partying ballz out) with a balloon tied around the sack for about 20 minutes.  Something I learned the first day:&nbsp; Bars in Chicago are open until 4:00 AM.&nbsp; :o)   SATURDAY   11:00 AM at some bar (name escapes me) throwing back bloody Mary's as fast as they can bring them.&nbsp; We meet Edith the waitress who is easily persuaded to hang out with us for the rest of the day as we gave her and her roommate tickets to the cubs game with us.&nbsp; Drunk by 1:00 with chicks in tow on the way to the game.  The Lawyer brings a cow outfit (complete with hat and utters) for Dave to wear for the balance of the day.&nbsp; He looked pathetic.&nbsp; It was perfect.  1:30&nbsp; Bleacher seats in Wrigley field.&nbsp; We stand under the scoreboard on top of a wall for the game.&nbsp; That place is fucken amazing!&nbsp; I drank 100 beers and me and the Lawyer didn't piss until the 8th inning.&nbsp; We beat the next closest contender by 4 innings.  After the game we goto tops where we employ the skills of Edith the hottie to get all 12 of us in without paying the $10 cover.&nbsp; Edith delivers.&nbsp; Dave on stage dressed as a Cow.&nbsp; We have a pic of the whole batch party going "ballz out".&nbsp; Nice....real nice.  Back to edith's house for a house party.&nbsp; (Have I mentioned how amazing Chi town is????).&nbsp; Party all night long at Ediths before going to the Dancing lizard which is a college like bar.&nbsp; By this time, our little Moo-Cow is back at the hotel....so we partied in his absence.  Hit up one more bar (the name as well as other details escape me) so that we can party till at least 2:30.&nbsp; Was a long day and lots of drinking done.   SUNDAY   Hit up 2 street festivals and went to Murphy's bar outside Wrigley to watch the cubs game.&nbsp; Got drunk yet again.&nbsp; I ended up spilling beer all over my crotch while trying to get away with a road soda.&nbsp; By the end of the day, I was done!  Ryan paid the airline an extra $100 so he could stay till this morning.&nbsp; He wins the "I haven't had enough yet" award.&nbsp; Kid is amazing.   So this is all the details I can remember or reveal.&nbsp; Awesome time!&nbsp; I think our boy can get married now!

       Back in the Saddle...   Well, my liver just informed me that it's getting bored. This comes with great timing as I'm leaving for a bachelor party in Chicago to celebrate my good buddy Dave's (the creator of the pants naming convention) slow but sure walk towards the plank that is his wedding. We travel half way across the country to make sure that good ole Dave feels like he "got it all in" before he plunges into the dark abyss that is marriage. There will be 8 doods in 2 hotel rooms. Two day affair, so sleep and a change of clothes is optional. I'm thinking bout just grabbing my drinking helmet and a change of sox and undies and hitting it. I've already retained a lawyer in the Chicago area and pre-paid my bail for any kind of drunken jailable offense. Hopefully I wont need it, but hey, who am I trying to fool.   So friends, as I dive into my 4th week straight of not being at home with my beloved Miss Pants, I look forward to divulging to you all of&nbsp;the details that I'm allowed to share (hey, bachelor party...some shit that happens in Chicago dies in Chicago). I bid you all a good weekend.    For those of you looking for a place to rob, I will be out of town from Friday morning till Sunday night! I keep most valuables under the bed and in the closet, so do forget to check there.    Cheers!

       Po-dunk, real drunk, junk in the trunk and a bank robber...    Po-dunk...  I went back to Colorado this weekend for a wedding.  Dood, that place is wonderful, but I feel like the place is about 15 years behind the civil engineering learning curve.  The roads there are not near large or elaborate enough to accommodate all of the traffic.  I spent the last 4 days with veins popping out of my forehead, and terrible things coming out of my mouth.  NOBODY there drives with ANY urgency.  Cant tell you how many times I've pleaded with people to GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!!!!!!  It will be a while before I can endure such incompetence behind the wheel!   drunk...  When in Rome, do what the Romans do.  I was drunk from about 1 hour after landing until Monday morning....around 11:00 AM.  I suspect that this hang over will persist until i leave friday for a bachelor party in Chicago.  Anyone have a liver they can loan me?  Mine's almost out!!!   junk in the trunk...  My lil bro Kevin is the man.  This kid should be on the fucken bomb squad...that's all i can say about this line item.  He is the master of disarming disaster!   a bank robber...  In an effort to expand my ever growing army of tattoos, I had planned to get one while in Colorado from a place where my little brothers go to get theirs.  We scope the place out, and I'm all stoked to go on Saturday morning to get inked...until i read the paper!  The asshole who gives the great tattoos decided to rob the bank (the one in the parking lot next to the parlor) and gets caught because intelligence is not what hez good at.  This foolz girl friend works at the bank, and he robbed it by going to the drive up and asking for all the money.  Little did he know that they could see him, and since they all see each other every fucken day, he was recognized and caught.  The tattoo parlor seems to be closed, and needless to say, i didn't get my ink.  Lame.  So there it is kids...yet another epic adventure.  There are, of course, details that i could never give you because i'm under N.D.A. but believe me when I say this...it was one unforgettable trip.  All of this happened around the main event which was a wedding of 2 good friends of mine.....they went through with it.

       On Pillow Fights...  Sooo this weekend I was exposed to one of the buried treasures in America.  The National Pillow Fighting championships.  No shit!  In podunk Northern Cali, there is a small town called Kenwood which hosted the 39th annual pillow fighting championship this last weekend.  Picture this... 2 hicks, on a wet, metal pole...Straddling it like a horse...suspended 4 feet over a mud pit!  The fighters go at it until someone falls from the pole....best 2 of three.  Fucken amazing is all I can say...even better than the doods, is when it was the ladies turn.  Holy cat fight...so awesome.  It's like girls gone wild meets mud wrestling.  Wish you all could have seen it.   urlLink Here's the link  if you need to see it with your own eyes.  I know what i'm doing next year...that's all I can say!  Hope everyone had a fun, safe 4th!

       Progress report Day 2...    Closer on the book. (About 30% of goal)  $50 @ Boswells (17% fo goal).  7 more Jack and Cokes (Almost 10% of goal).  1.5 hours more of kickboxing (33% of goal).   On a side note, I have a bit of a gripe. You ever take your car in to get the rear view mirror adjusted and you leave the garage $800 later having been told you need new breaks, a new flex compactor, and a flush and refill of blinker fluid. I didn't know blinkers needed fluid! Fucken assholes...I might as well wear a shirt that says:  "I'm a total asshole and will pay top dollar for nothing because I don't know shit about cars!"  This is where having a Dad would have proved instrumental! Now you try to rip me off on bad produce...look out! I can spot a bruise on an eggplant from a 100 yards out!

By the end of the class, it looked like someone placed an egg on the top of my foot, right under the skin. I can't even bare to look at the thing. So swollen! I can't help but get hurt...friggen unbelievable!

       I'm Changing...  I've started to see new behavior in me. My shrink swears that it's a positive growth phase I'm in. I think I'm just getting older and more jaded. What used to be extreme sensitivity constant internalization is being replaced by a numbness or indifference to things. Even those subjects, people, places, and things that I used to have passionate feelings or toughs for seem to have become less important thoughts that pass through my head without consideration. Don't get me wrong....my peeps are my peeps, but I just have a far lower tolerance for bullshit and drama. I think I'm just tired of the anxiety that comes with being so concerned about things. I think I need a long holiday......and the right companion to join me.

      For 4 days now in Washington state a fire has been burning inside a 3-acre manure lagoon on a dairy farm. Sources say that fire crews are fighting the fire with wet cow shit. The cause of the fire is unknown, but one possibility is spontaneous crap combustion. Fire crews are unable to travel on the 3-acre island of shit, for fear of sinking in. As one fire fighter put it, "If they went down we'd never find them."   To the dude who decided to fight  merde  with  merde :  BEATDOWN . To the dairy farmer who built a 3-acre&nbsp; merde  resevoir:  BEATDOWN .

      To the Euro dumbshit who--as if it's not annoying enough to have 2 solid weeks of vacation (damn Euros)--sends out his vacation schedule as a meeting invite, thereby blocking out&nbsp;everyone's&nbsp;outlook calendar and causing a massive CF where no one knows when anyone else is free-- all the&nbsp;while he no doubt sits unaware sipping Grappa in Mykanos (or somewhere equally irritating).&nbsp; To him I issue an inspector gadget expando-leg across the pond roundhouse&nbsp;no the world doesn't revolve around you-style BEATDOWN.&nbsp;

      SO, over here in building (E)xile, the Robo-Coffee machine has been out of service since last Thursday.&nbsp; As if that's not reason enough to merit a healthy BEATDOWN, the water dispenser is now not functioning either.   Someone should be forced to stay up all night long, then forced to eat sand, then forced to hang out in the (E)xile breakroom...and then of course given a hearty BEATDOWN!!!!!!

      I'm glad that while the stock finds new depths of the toilet to snake, our intrepid marketing department is spending time wondering what we should name the new version of a demo that wasn't impressive when it was released back in the paleolithic.  BEATDOWN.

      This is an actual email thread.&nbsp; Beatdown to the Nth degree for this tool!  &nbsp;  First He Said:  From: Rando Sent: Monday, July 19, 2004 5:28 PM  To: E Subject: RE: Weblogs  Hmmm, I just noticed your meeting is in SC-E1… sneaky!!! :) Playing devil's advocate, I would think that it would be more efficient to book some rooms here, and for just you to walk over rather than making us all walk over. But I'm just saying that because I'm a lazy ass. :)  &nbsp;  Then e Said:  From: E  Sent: Monday, July 19, 2004 5:31 PM  To: Rando  Subject: RE: Weblogs  I gave you the opportunity to make the meeting at a time/place that was convenient for you and you asked me to do it. I'm here, and so is the consultant who is working on it with me. You are the only one NOT in Bldg E so I'm going to have to decline. It's not that long of a walk. Wear some good walking shoes tomorrow!  &nbsp;  And that Douche Bag actually Said:  Ha ha ha… good point. I most certainly can't blame you (unfortunately). :)  I'm happy to walk. (Really)  See you tomorrow,  Randy   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  BEATDOWN!

      Yes my nvNinjas, the time has come again for the quarterly IT re-org.  I hope to retain my position as chief toilet paper stocker here in building, but who knows....maybe i'll be promoted to soda machine filler...I have my fingers crossed.  I'll let you all know when I get back from Chicago ( urlLink You can read more details here ).  On a serious note...those who re-org this often ought to shampoo my crotch....they also should be served up a huge steaming pile of  BEATDOWN!   See ya on the flip. ~e

      Today while driving to work I was stopped at a red light. In the crosswalk on the other side of the street was a very pregnant woman. She was moving swiftly and was just about to get to the other side of the crossing...  Meanwhile, this MASSIVE SUV drove up wanting to make a right hand turn onto the street the woman was crossing. This guy had the balls to come to a rolling stop and couldn't wait for the woman to get all the way across and went out into the middle of the intersection to get around her while she was crossing.  To the self-important prick who would rather get to where he was going ten seconds faster than wait for a pregnant woman to finish crossing the street: BEATDOWN.

      I'd like to offer a beatdown—in advance—for every time somebody says "we're not concerned about the stock price" today. Think of it as the official  Company Name  drinking game, only instead of alcohol, you have to pound rusty nails directly into your kneecaps.

      From the suggestion box:  Flaming Hot Cheetos Regular cheetos are weak, despite their claim to be "Dangerously Cheesy." I think the cultural representation at  company name   would justify the move from regular Cheetos to Flaming Hot. Lets step it up a notch in the cheese flavored snack arena.  To this cheeze dick i give a BEATEN WITH A CHEEZIE DICK BEATDOWN!

      Question: If you send copy for approval and it comes back "approved" is it really approved? Answer: If you're a company that rhymes with SubiCoughed apparently the answer is "no."  To those that need to flex their dicks by demanding a consistant flow of approving approved approvals... BEATDOWN!!
