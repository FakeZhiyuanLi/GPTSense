      I walked into AT&T hoping to pay on my go phone account. The clerk, a young Black female, was already helping a customer, another young Black female. As I walked in the clerk was asking her for her work phone number to which the customer replied "Girl! I don't be knowing no phone numbers. I think its 855 something. Just put Nissan." The clerk chuckled and proceeded helping her establish her account.   There was another clerk, a pseudo-young white male, on the phone as I proceeded to survey my surrounding. He seemed to be on an important call, so I simply stood in line awaiting to helped. After five minutes the guy walked over to me, said I'll be right with you, and went into the back. The clerk already assisting the customer looks at me and says 'I'm sorry, I guess his personal call is more important'. By her tone you could tell this is something that has happened before. My mind raced and I thought 'here we go'.   The woman who was being waited on upon my arrival was accompanied by what I assume was her brother or her boyfriend and her son, who could not have been any older than three or four.   He ran around the place, unruly, but very innocently. He was playing cops and robbers or so it seemed, since he kept screening about who [his imaginary playmate] had the gun. The gentlemen and I, and secretively the clerk waiting on his mother, watched as he crawled back and forth across the building, screamed and tackled, kicked and enjoyed. What struck me was that the mother was so casual about his public behavior. I admit I am not the best when it comes to kids, but I believe there should be some type of decorum taught in public. Something to the effect of  BE STILL .   After another five minutes of this and the witnessing of:  Clerk: What's your home phone number?  Customer: Girl!! I ain't got no home phone. Stop Jerod.  Clerk: He has a good imagination.  Customer: Girl!! He play like this at home. I mean it ain't nobody but me and him.   Jerod (who has collapsed on the floor after 15 seconds of silence): I want a baby.   Clerk: He wants a baby?  Customer: Girl!! He silly.  Clerk: Where is he going to get a baby from? He wants you to make a baby? (now becoming frantic at the mother's lack of concern) Jerod, where are you going to get a baby from?  Jerod: I'm going to make one.   The mother laughs, the clerk sighs and I am growing agitated.   Mr. Clerk finally returns and asks what he could do for me. I explained I was there to make a payment. He asked what type of phone did I have while simultaneously physically searching my person for it. I backed away and said 'I have a GO phone'.  He asked "Is the phone off."  I answered "No"  Without pausing to hear my answer he continues "Because if it is off it will take..."  Again "No, my phone is not off"  I assumed he had gotten the message. He walked around the counter and started punching keys. He asked the other clerk for a dollar, I still have no clue why. Then he beckons me to step forward:  Mr. Clerk: What is your cell phone number?  Me: 601-  Mr. Clerk: Make sure you give me the right number.  Me: Why would I give you the wrong number?  Mr. Clerk: You have no clue how many people who don't know their phone numbers.  Me: [classic sarcasm]  urlLink Really?   Customer: Girl!! Yea!! Cuz I don't be knowing my numbas all the time. It just happen like dat. I didn't even know my work numba.   Mr. Clerk (who has come from around the counter to demonstrate): Because people come in here all dragged out and they're like uh duh uh...  All of which I could possibly have understood had I not been in the process of giving him my number before he went off on this acid trip. Seeming as though this clerk was obviously tact-less, and wor-king my nerves, I interrupted his speech to motion (read: push) him back around the counter because I was more than tired of his BS.   After finally handing my receipt to me and freeing me from this torture, I headed for the nearest exit. There was a customer entering as I left and I could only hold my head in fear for what she was about to encounter.   Notes on this experience for those who did not see it as I did:  After remembering what I heard of Mr. Clerk's conversation he was no doubt having phone sex, which explains why he had to take it in the back.   Mr. Clerk is aware of his position as the alpha male in that facility. He knows when the shit hits the fan the Black Chic gets the ax first.   When Jerod turns 16 and says to mommy that his girlfriend is pregnant will she remember she released all rights to be upset. He already told her he wanted to make a baby, by her silence she condoned his actions.   I can not say Mr. Clerk was racist but he was definitely prejudice. He made assumptions from what he saw, a young Black woman dressed in hip-hop fashion, and implied that a) I must be reconnecting a disconnected phone b) I must be too ashamed to admit it c) I will lie about what phone I have for whatever reason d) My time is worthless and e) it is necessary for excuses to be made for adults who don't take ownership over the products they purchase.  The customer being waiting on from the time I got there to the time I left was obviously offended by my infliction when I sarcastically asked about giving wrong numbers. Yes that was on purpose.   Needless to say my cell phone bill is now REFT so there will be no more trips to hell town.

      He was 26 years old and from Memphis Tennessee. September 17 he decided to drive 80 miles to hold 15 people hostage for pizza, sodas and his life. This is about all the info the police have as well.    Harold Kilpatrick, Jr., 26, took about 15 people hostage at about 12:50 p.m. CST, but then released four of them, said Lisa McDowell, Dyersburg Police spokeswoman. He was holding them in a second-floor classroom of the Eller building, McDowell said.   Kilpatrick is from Memphis but had recently been staying with his sister in Dyersburg, McDowell said. He was neither a student at the community college, nor did he work there, she said.   The Dyersburg Police Special Operations Response Team and hostage negotiation team were addressing the man through the classroom wall, she said. Kilpatrick told police he wanted to commit suicide and left a suicide note, Williamson said.   He said the man was believed to have a 9 mm handgun and barricaded the classroom's doors.   Earlier, Kilpatrick was refusing to negotiate with authorities and would only talk to them using his hostages as intermediaries on cell phones, Williamson said.   Later in the evening, though, McDowell said the suspect began talking with police and even ordered pizzas and sodas to share with his hostages.   The chief said the man claimed to be a member of al Qaeda, and the FBI had been informed of the claim.   "I don't know about that, but that's his story," Williamson said, shaking his head.

      When MLK marched thru Greenwood, Mississippi both of my parents skipped school to be apart of history. Their contribution did not stop there. They spent their lives attempting to upturn a system that sat on top of them. They helped open doors I can now simply walk thru. I do not know their struggle, although I can not help but sympathize.   I first 'realized' I was Black when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I was in Wal-Mart when a little white girl rubbed her hand across mine and then ran to her mother. She acted as though I had given her 'cooties'. I didn't understand. I was clean, I was well dressed, there was no difference between us other than the color of our skin.   My parents did not teach me to love everyone as equals. They taught me not to trust white people. Period. End of lesson. I had always been conditioned to believe whites were sometype of anomally that deserved reverence and attention, be it negative or positive.   In High School I took a course called Theory of Knowledge. This course required us to think outside the box. It made us ask the questions we had been told were out of line. What made the teacher correct? What is a belief? What is race? This course allowed us to see life as well as knowledge from a totally different perspective. It showed us there is natural progression to all things. Even authority.   I had always been to Black schools, had Black friends and I was an adult before I had a friendship with anyone outside of my 'race'. She was different to say the least but I noticed when I hung out with her and her friends I was not treated like the 'Black' chic of the group as I had been warned I would be. I was treated as a member of the group. As with any relationship with anyone, I made my share of mistakes and misjudgements and I was always waiting for the shoe to drop. I was always waiting for my white friend to disassociate with me and tire of my Blackness as I had been warned she would.   I'm still waiting. By them conditioning me to be cautious they were actually creating a complex. Instead of receiving a message to disregard color, I was learning to judge by it. Where I should have been getting to know this person and understand them for who they are, I was instead judging them by what stereotypes dictated they should have been. I was waiting for the doublecross that has yet to come. But that is a risk you take in any relationship with any person you acquaint yourself with, regardless of their color.    What I have learned over the years is that color is a state of mind. As with all karma what you put out is always what you get back. If you see everything in Black and White that is all you will ever get. I don't see my friend as my 'white' friend, she's just my friend. A person no more or no less than me. Her skin color no more makes her a threat than a young man with his pants sagging. It is the content of their character that dictates their actions. And the content of their character can not be seen in their skin.   I can not carry the battles of my parents on my back. There are new battles out there to fight. I am in no way saying racism does not exist. Also, I do not mean to imply that one should not be cautious of the intentions and motives of others. I am only saying the main battle is not fighting the evil 'white' people. The battle, at least for me, is helping others realize they have the power to change their circumstances thru the choices they make. My parents and their generation provided that privilege. They fought long and hard to give us the opportunity to know life beyond the boundaries of color. So why would I limit myself on the basis of pigmentation?

      I am not a people person so why do I work in Customer Service? Every Thursday - Monday at five am I awake and head to a major Telecommunications Center to answer the calls of complete idiots.   My beef with Consumers is simple, if you buy a product at least take the time to learn how to use the equipment. If you have a pager LEARN YOUR PAGER NUMBER. If you move to a new area and need a phone or lights or cable, KNOW THE ADDRESS OF WHERE YOU NEED THEM. Telling me to just use your Post Office Box means absolutely scratch. Yes I can actually send service to that PO Box, but my friend it would do you no good.   Small talk can be a wonderful thing if in fact it is just that - small. But if your tire caught on flat; you ripped a hole in your new suit; you were late for work; the day after you had just been warned not be late again; your life partner/spouse/loved one chewed you out for no apparent reason and/or your favorite show was interrupted by another PSA from Good Ol' Dubya. PLEASE don't choose that hour to call Customer Service and ask me why you have not received a page in two months. (Why have you waited 2 months to call about it?) Besides, no matter what I say you will somehowwork into the conversation your general melancholy and quite frankly I don't want to hear it. I just can't tell you that because 'this call may be recorded for Quality Assurance purposes'.   These companies send you invoices knowing that the only part you will ever actually look at is: Total Due. Do me a favor, when 'Total Due' says some outrageous number take the time to search through the rest of the invoice to see why you were actually charged. Which implicates you would have to know what rate plan you are on and what charges are associated with that rate plan. I say this because when you call me and I explain how the charges on your bill are accurate I want you to be able to say more than 'Oh I didn't even bother to look at that'. And in the not-so-rare-as-you-would-hope case that you have been over charged, be one of the privileged few who actually read the terms and conditions (which include in small print how companies can ultimately screw you at will). Because when I tell you it will take up to 60 days to give back the money it only took us 60 seconds to take, I don't want you to become irate and hear me chuckle at your request to speak with a supervisor (who will only come back to me and have me explain to them what should be done...and you gotta love that).   All I am asking is for you, the consumer/customer/provider of my paycheck, to take responsibility for the products and services you purchase. Become knowledgeable of what is due you and considerate of what is not. No, you can not have 3 months of free services because you missed 1 page. No, I will not credit you back $326.21 because you have to pay your rent and you used your debit card with the Visa logo. No, I will not call you when I get off and it does not matter if I am married or have a boyfriend, are you that desperate or do I sound that gullible. And no, your cursing ranting and raving will not make this road any smoother, as a matter of fact, I'm going to place you on hold (Customer Service Time-Out) so that you can think about your behavior!   I am expected to carry a friendly attitude despite your attempt to p*ss me off, which I might be obliged to allow if this call were not 'being recorded for Quality Assurance purposes'. This is my job and not my career, I will do everything I can to make you happy. Help me to help you...   P.S. In the case you are from California or New York, please be advised it is not a compliment to tell me I speak well to be a Southerner or that you love my accent (well I'm not too fond of yours). Do not ask me if I am White or Black. And the next person who drops into my line and says 'Do you all wear shoes down there' YOUR CALL (and possibly your service) WILL BE DISCONNECTED, screw Quality Assurance!!

      An excellent resource for any Religious Research is the  urlLink Instituition for Religious Research .   The best research of all is to read the religious text yourself. Quotes mean less if you do not know what inspired them or what context they are being used. For most religions words are   not   interchangeable.

      I have come off the high of confrontation and now I am attempting to move back into my normal patterns or abnormal patterns would be more like it. At any rate the past two days have been most interesting. I had to republish this entire blog to erase the deflamatory comments left by one misguided soul. I still think one of my friends saw what she posted though.   I did not think there were rules to this. I thought this cyberspace was free to us all to release ourselves of the statements we hold hostage.  The most important thing should not be who reads it and whether they like it, but it should be getting it out. No statement can be heard without it being said. We will work on  understanding  it once its born. Even the process of deciphering the message can be used to bring people closer together. It creates dialogue. And doesn't dialogue create understanding? Understanding creates tolerance. Tolerance breeds acceptance and acceptance is peace.   What I said about not wanting to be like the  adults  was simply in reference to all the bickering. I have seen enough of that in 24 years to last me a life time. If all you can do is insult me then I really don't have time for you. We can discuss what you don't like about me or what you think I did to you. Allow both parties to bring their point of views to the table and the circumstances which reenforces them but do not sink so low as to point and go 'nah nah ni nah na'.  By far I do not want to seem like a saint, I am far from it. Right now I am having major issues with the fact that I know a friend who I do care for deeply, read on these sites some things I wrote about her religion. If nothing else that would qualify as deceitful. Which was not my intent. My intent was to get the issues that I was having accepting her belief foundation out of my system without going to her and seeming as though I was questoning her specifically. I knew she would see it ebentually and I think thats a good thing. But I wanted her only to see my remarks not those of outsiders criticizing her, she gets enough of that as is. My hope was that one day we could sit and go over all the things here on her terms. I say on her terms because she gets defensive if you bring things to her. I am a fairly patient person so I can wait for the conversation to simply arise.   I know in my notes I define the difference between honest and truthful and right now I am not being honest. But how can you be honest with someone who expends so much energy in hiding from the truth. She can hate me if she chooses, that's nothing new. I have made people hate me before for a lot less. As long as it poses the question 'This is where I am and this is what got me here. Am I happy about this?' I can't lie to myself about that question. There is no way to do so. When you try to fool yourself into thinking you are really happy thats when you get that slight pang in your chest of dry air. It's inescapable.   Changing your lifestyle or way of thinking can be the hardest change to make because it causes you to examine not only yourself but those around you. Everything has to go under a microscope even the one thing you thought you knew for certain. We are slaves to our mentality. So something or someone has to come along to pull us out of that mindframe for at least a second. Otherwise we would not ever see anything beyond what we have accepted. I wouldn't be able to say it had I not been thru it.   I believe everyone deserves to be happy. Even when their happiness impedes on my personal comfort or warrants me expendable from their circle. I can deal with that, its not about me (as much as I would like everything to be :-) It's about a common goal within all of us: to survive in this world and to do so under the best physical, mental and emotional conditions.  Am I being presumptuous? Of course!  As for the 'haters' I find them flattering. I learned the hard way that I can not please everybody. I don't write about things that already make sense, that would be redundant. Redudancy can not be original and original is all I know how to be.

      The past 12 hours have been quite adrenaline packed; on and off the computer. I learned after Freshman year not to attempt to defend myself to someone who has you persecuted. Its a waste of time. They already have it set in their minds to see the worst in you. Surprisingly I actually learned that lesson.   I will be the first to admit I was more interested in Band than English in Junior High a folly that I am now attempting to correct. No my grammar isn't the best but its the words that I am concerned with. Still I give credit where credit is due. I do need to make sure Punctuation is a class that I am registered for next semester.   On the B side of things, I am infected. Yes, infected. I am infected with these pangs of needing to relieve the angst of being so damn understanding. Hence my personal blogs. As humans we all deal with emotion in different ways. My way is to find an interesting way to write that emotion. Even when it comes out as babble. At the time of writing I am not expecting anyone to read it but me. Yes, I could write it on paper but the simple fact that I don't have to settle for paper means I can explore all the options available to me and choose the one most adequate for the thought or emotion being expressed at the time. Simplified: different things come out different ways on different surfaces. Regardless of whether you are an artist or living human being.   Even though I take the bulk of insults lightly while charmingly smiling and returning calm but observative and reflective refutes, I am still quite human. And some people, well, some people will drive you to cussing. Fortunately the blood of Generation X flows thru so most tension is released with five small but powerful words:  I don't give a fuck. Seems rather infantile but it proves to be quite effective. As with any lie, if you say it to yourself enough times you actually begin to believe it.

      My company has relocated us to a new, more modern and highly secure building. Every morning I run, literally, down to the cafeteria for breakfast. We have been warned: not to eat at our desk, not to have drinks at our desk, any food must be consumed in the cafeteria. We are urged to sit in the front of the cafe, not to fraternized (read: bother) anyone from other departments and any food left from the meal must be disposed of before returning to the floor. Anyone caught with food at their desk will be reprimanded. For food?   The building we just left, I agree was nasty, but they had been in that building upwards of 8 years of course it was going to be nasty, especially when you only have 1 person cleaning in behind 500.   I understand their train of thought: Keep this new building new. But is treating adults like children really going to accomplish this?  You can see people at their desk choking on crumbs when management walks by. Nabs are hidden in the far crevices of desk drawers. Should people really fear losing their job if they spill water? (And yes it really is that serious)  The saddest part is the walk to the cafeteria. You have to take the elevator down to the Plaza and then walk through the hub, 1/4 mile, to get to the cafe. The hub is basically the stock hall. Everything that doesn't work or has no more use is stored there(Cletus are you trying to tell me something?). The hub is straight out of a major motion thriller. It leaks. Its dark. You can hear unidentified movements lurking behind unaccessible doors. Did I mention my department is the only section that has to use the hub? To take the conspiracy theory even further, our access to floors and doors that would be quicker en route to the cafe is off limits.   The major issue is that, none of the other departments are under such strict guidelines. And it is causing quite the issue in the office. We feel like we are the step children of the company. Whenever we attempt to address our discourse it is simply implied "Be glad you have a job!" Is that truly the right response? What about work morale? They are doing nothing to improve it but they continue to expect outstanding results.   Managers patrol the floor looking for any sign of edible contraband. That lets me know that my job has to be expendible if this is all you have to do all day!   Whats even worse than us being the children under the stairs is the cleaning people in the building are treated even worse. They sit on the far side of the cafeteria in nothing less then a corner, where they are instructed to sit. They sit by themselves, too themselves. If we make eye contact (as is the Southern way) they speak then proceed on their way with heads down. Why aren't we able to mingle amongst one another? What separates management from us and us from them besides title and responsibility? And the most important question would I have even noticed had I not been in the same position as them?

      I guess I could give an explanation for the abundance of religious material on the sites. No I am not a mormon myself but someone very close to me is. In an effort to understand them better I wanted to read the scriptural text for Mormons, which is primarily (other than the Bible) the Book of Mormon or the BoM (not to mention Doctrines and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, Journal of Discourses, Book of Moses, Book of Abraham, kinda sorta...etc). The BoM opens with testimonies and an account of the Prophet Joseph Smith (translator of the BoM) and his trials in receiving the message of the Angel Moroni. The story is a good one actually. At any rate, Mormon is one of the prophets who ascended to Heaven and became an angel. Moroni is his son who was also a leader of the righteous tribe in America. (Take into effect that this is grossly generalized for the sake of making this brief)  I think one of the biggest misconceptions with Mormons is thinking that they don't believe in Christianity. Quite the contrary. They believe themselves, by definition, to be the true Christians. I say by definition because you have to have an understanding of the faith in order to appreciate why they feel that way.   At first I couldn't get past the first few chapters. I wanted to cry. I was confused. Not spiritually but mentality. I could not understand how my friend could be so taken by what I thought was so fabricated. I was torn between calling out what to me seemed like such a falsehood and respecting the belief system of someone I cared for. I am known for my objectivity, I can give anything the benefit of the doubt but this was going too far. Too understand you would have to have a better understanding of me and my friend. I will say I accomplished one goal, I definitely was able to understand my friend better.  We were chatting one day after she had read a post I had written on Blogcritics and she asked, excitedly I might add, how far along I had gotten in the BoM and what I thought. First of all I dont like discussing books until I have completely finished them. And I mean completely. Usually I look up additional sources and then read reviews. But this time I had stopped in the middle of reading the BoM to do this. I had looked up accounts of ex communicated Mormons and their stories. I read several biographies on Joseph Smith to get an idea of what kind of young man he was(he was only 14 at the time of his vision). I read any text referenced or mentioned about or around the BoM. Of course Ifelt no need to tell her this. My friend feels better when she's confident. I didn't want to just throw all that I had learned at her and seem like I was judging so I just asked that we discuss it later.   We ended up meeting at the local Barnes and Noble one night just to chat as we sometimes did. And she ended up asking me about the BoM again. So we discussed it or rather I asked general questions and let her give detailed answers. I was alright until she said 'I'm sure you don't know anything about this but...' Why include that? Then when I said something else she said 'Oh you're reading stuff from the internet' And? She doesn't see how thats judging. Then to top it off when I as casually as possible said I didn't see what she saw, she scoffed at me. She said 'If my family didn't like of course I'm ok with my friend not." Valid point but unnecessary.I mean I understand it was a major sacrifice for her to let go of her family, but I'm sitting here fighting against myself to remain objective and you basically shrugging me off (  I had always known she was Mormon or more correctly a member of the LDS church but I had not known what being Mormon entailed until I read the book, doctrines and scriptures. At first I was hurt. I really had to pray. I was disgusted with myself for judging someone else's belief system but I felt like someone needed to point out the holes. Who appointed me that person? Noone so I kept my opinion to myself.   The notes you see that pertain to Mormonism come from me. Normally if I am reading and I come across a scripture or think of a question I have to put it down immediately or I will forget. It is only because I have had this blog a week or so that the majority of the notes are about Mormonism. That and I was in the middle of reading the BoM when I started this blog. Give me a few months and you will see a vast range of temporary obsessions. Yes, obsessions. I have a big issues with proving my point. Most of the time, its me proving them to myself and not others. I deal with criticism better as long as I know or feel as though I have the answers. (yes I am that narcissistic)  I think, no I know,thats why when she said 'I'm sure you don't know anything about this but...' I got really heated. I know she tries not to judge people but she does it subconsciously. I asked her what did she consider judging and she could only answer 'I judge myself'. That wasn't answering the question. For instance we were discussing politics one night and I asked what party did she belong to (I've known her over 2 years and never knew)? She is a republican and I am democrat and when Bush was brought up she asked: 'And why didn't you vote for Bush, cause he's Republican' Do you see the judgement or do I need to point it out. Playing dumb has its benefits, being perceived as dumb is not one of them.   At any rate. I am still very much into the Mormon debate and even though I told her I wasn't interested I think I may just set up an appointment with the missionaries to hear their pov. As for my friend she is die hard in her beliefs. Which I can appreciate because we all should be. But sometimes I have to ask if it isn't just for believing sake. Even though she says we wont have that conversation again, I know we will, its inevitable, if for no other reason than she reads my blogs (she knows even if I dont say it, I have to write it.) My concern is the context of the conversation. You cant effectively discuss a belief systems without discussing the influencing factors. (See the circle?) I know how much she hates feeling like she's being judged and I can not see us discussing religion (hers or mine) explicitly without throwing in some judgments.   Have you ever had a conversation with someone where you are discussing one central thing but you never name that thing? Those are interesting conversations to have especially since you can always come back and say 'I didn't say that' There is no accountability in a conversation like that. And you know what I'm on one of my tangents this would have been better on a note but its 4 in the morning and I really dont care about notes right now:-)  I think religion (or any moral belief system) is a very important Blog topic it is the basis by which we make our choices(i.e critiques). But I think in order to really reflect we have to pull away and even question our belief system, regardless of the religion creed or color.

      I'm only 24. La di da di da. Age is just number whether you are 24 or 64 if you have not grown out of childish ways, your age represents how long you've been acting like a child.   A fellow Blogger of the sinister cabal has taken offense to some comments posted to comments from a post that I made. I repeat 'offense to some comments posted to comments from a post that I made'. Now she went thru the regular tirade of letting them know how racist they were and so and so. when people didn't jump on her bag waggon as she felt they should, she clicked. she threatened to leave, threatened to delete her post and cause financial harm to the site by petitioning the sponsor: Amazon.   If I am not mistaken, and I often am, Blogs are for the purpose of stating your opinions. How can you get pissed at someone's opinion? Even if it is that they do not like you? Its that one person's opinion. Big Deal! Needless to say I stayed quiet, then finally I said:   Hmmm as a 'person of color' (like we all arent people of color) I do not know whether this will hurt, hender or harm 'the Black Movement' but suffice it to say I must be heard or read...  Painstakingly I must admit that Al, no matter how zealous and unrelenting in its efforts still deserves the right to express his opinion, no matter how unruling it may be. His unyielding attempt to provoke reactions is exactly the main reason I love this site. Its the left field attitudes that force the rest of us to either sh*t or get off the pot(excuse my french).   I can not speak for others but I enjoy that. Being of unsound mind and body I do not take pleasure in anything too easy. If there is no challenge there is no interest, so Al, Andy and Joe are all necessary. Were some of their comments out of line? Hell yea! But so were the Diva's. She let her personal outrage remove her objectiveness causing her point to be moot. Hey, it happens to the best of us.   I don't think what the 3 musketeers (yea I said it) said warrented her resignation, especially since it seemed she had been quite a contributor. If nothing else she should have been more willing and adamant about creating a presence that would supress what she perceived as their bigotry...But eh, what do I know?   To which I received a comment from said 'upset Blogger':  Dew, I've been cutting you some slack on the grounds of youth and naivete. End of that. What you've posted above is pure piffle   To which I replied:   You know I was waiting for the Diva to pick on the little kids too. Somehow I knew for her inanity, this was the only logical next step. And thats fine.   Unlike her if I am not mistaken I have in no way said anything at all disrespectful or demeaning about her or her work. So wouldn't that make Mac Diva somewhat of a hypocrite? Or does that make me a neo-Confederate too?   If my thoughts to you are 'piffle', guide me. Confer with me and allow me the chance to become better in what you perceive better to be. But your rants are getting old and I haven't even been here long.   Al could be the Grand Dragon if he wants to be but I will give him this when he insults he also disputes. Which at the moment is more than I can say for the Diva. It is much better to have a forum where opinions can be expressed, however conflicting they may be, rather than have intolerent attitudes on the streets where violence can erupt.   Am I young? Yes, admittedly. Now that we understand my reason for acting as such tell me Diva what is yours? As you would have people think: it was not that long ago I was playing in the sandbox. And, if I remember correctly there was always one person who had to have their way and if they couldn't they threatened to leave the sandbox. I am terribly sorry to have bothered you with my piffle, but please if you are leaving don't get sand in your shorts on the way out.  And in the indelible words of Faith Hill   Breathe    I feel sorry for her for one reason: she started throwing insults. When all you can resort to is insulting people, basically you have allowed them to win.   To be quite honest, as I normally am, I admired the Diva. I would have loved to be under her tutelage because she had a lot to offer. I signed up for the Blog experience to grow as a writer not to coddle adults who can not stand to be disagreed with. If she's upset be adult enough to self examine the real reasons why, but don't strike at any and everybody because you have run out of ways to prove your point.   I'll be the first to admit, I didn't even know what piffle was. So I looked it up. Am I upset she called my writing, which I thought was quite readable, piffle? No, I am upset she didn't give me reasons why it was piffle. I'm all about growing and learning, but if this is what being an adult is about you grown folks can have it!!

      Why do we need religion anyway? Because where would you be without direction. We all need two things, somewhere to go and a way to get there, without it we are lost (Literally and figuratively). It’s all a manner of control. Religion gives us the idea that we are in control of those things physically out of our hands. Those without religion even toss in the air something has to govern everything. Some call it the universe but most call it God.   Religion gives us a sense of purpose, a reason to be. Insinuating we were without reason before. It allows us to see in ourselves what we hope to become and it gives us reason to believe becoming so is actually possible. Believe–believe-believe? See a pattern?   Believe is defined as having trust, faith and confidence in; to accept as real or true. Do we believe facts? No. Why? Because facts are incontestable, the truth as we define it is before our eyes. No proof necessary. Does that mean that anything not before our eyes is false? No but this gives reason to the necessity of belief: those things we can not put our finger on, yet have the experiences and/or revelations within our lives to know exist.   I have never seen wind or air. EVER! Yet I can feel it. I can feel and see its effects, so despite the fact I can not hold it in my hand, I know its there. Why can’t a higher power exist to which the same can be applied? I called out for help and help was given. I cried for peace and peace came over me. And what about the times when I was too blind to see for myself what lie ahead? Who urged me to turn away? Who laid the distractions before my path? Who causes my spirit trouble when I think all is well? Who controls the parts of my being I have no control over? Who loves me when I refuse to love myself? In hindsight I could say I control it all but during the time of discontent all I could see was confusion. If you can’t see clearly and there is no other person in the car, what happens? Hint: If you pull over its called suicide.   Why you? Why would God want to be apart of your life? Why not? The one thing you are guaranteed is free will. You always have a choice, even when the gun is to your head, your choice still remains. No one can take away your right to choose for yourself. We often feel when the consequence is heavy our choice is removed. No, your choice becomes distinct not non-existent. Even when that decision is to deny God it is still your choice to make. But what if you have been receiving protection you knew nothing about? Then one day it was presented to you and you denounced that protection?   Let’s say I have been following in the shadows all your life, keeping you from the perils that lurk about and one day through my own will I present myself to you and you curse me. I gave everything I was to you without you knowing and after I reveal myself to you and you curse my name, I choose to give you nothing. And then you start to have an open eye of those things that I once protected you from. You begin this path of wild and reckless behavior and when you are introduced to me again you curse me more, now for what I allow. But when I was there for you that was not enough, my existence and my purpose was not enough. You had to have more. So I allowed you to have everything. Everything I kept from you. And when it finally overwhelms you, and it will, you cry out for the protection. You seek out the answers that will give you the peace you cursed me for. Because the answers are what will give you peace, not me, right? I am not enough. Realizing this I show you what it is you need to see in order to grow until its time to allow you to see me once more, because the next time will be the last. The next time I will not have to show you, you will seek me out.   No you don’t need religion, its God that you need. And who doesn’t need someone else in their life who only wants to love them?

      When the Black guy coming down the street with his pants sagging and his gold teeth shimmering, do you feel the need to lock your car door? When the white guy tells the nigger joke about not being able to say nigger, as a Black person do you get offended? When you see a Mexican, have you ever seen just 'a' Mexican? Does every short person with squinted eyes have to be Chinese or Japanese (is that the only Asian experience)? Are all female basketball players really lesbians? If a man doesn't like sports does that mean he's gay? Do you get uncomfortable when you are approached by a large group of the opposite (Opposite - as if there were only two) race? Do all New Yorkers have such a bad attitude? Do all Southerners have nothing better to do than populate? What really is Poor White Trash? Have you ever thought interracial dating as the ultimate evil?   I was in Wally World (Wal-Mart) one Mississippi hot night and saw an interracial couple standing in line ahead of me. They had a baby with them that seemed to be no older than maybe 6 months, I couldn’t help but stare at the child, it was gorgeous. It was wearing neutral colors and no bows or gender specific clothing, hence the reference as ‘it’. After what I believe was a minute or so, the father (who was black) gave the mother (who was white) an exasperated nudge and pointed at me. I could only laugh and turn away. For a second the father looked as though he wanted to approach me but decided against it after the mother dissuaded him. I wish she had let him come. I’m sure as an interracial couple in the south they are used to the stares and the grimaces, but for him to be agitated shows his insecurity at his situation. But everyone isn’t out to get them. I could careless about the two of them I was admiring the child.   The experience brought to my attention the issue of stereotypes and how they affect us. As independent as we would like to assume ourselves, are we really? Every action has a reaction even if we are not present to witness it. How many times had they been stared at or ridiculed for being with one another? And every new stare conceived a new resentment that leads to a final straw. Was my stare the final straw or did I just make it worse for the next person who gives them a cross eyed look? Guess I’ll never know, but why must they be in that position in the first place?.   I love to read and I love philosophy. Often people walk by my desk and see Plato or Nietzsche or (yes I dare say) Harry Potter or whatever I am reading that day and I am asked “Are you reading that for school?” No I am not. Once I answer and they realize this is just light reading for me, I get the look: the look of I-must-be-from-another-planet-because-who-would-read-that-stuff-for-fun? I would. Then comes the awkward silence and the eager escape. Its like they expect me to roll out the stone dais and recite Socrates’ Apology so they give me a grunt and run away. What changed between them knowing and not knowing what I like to read? The implication changed. As long as all they knew about me was what they could see, they had something to identify with. My skin color implied I was Black like us, a state of mind, not the color. When there became a catalyst to alter that identifying factor, I was no longer one of ‘us’ but one of ‘them’. And how do you find common ground with ‘them’? I already knew it was uncomfortable for most people to think or see outside their self-inflicted boxes, but why?  Why do we not accept people for who they are instead of who we need them to be in order to be comfortable with them (read it now, figure it out later)? Doesn’t that implicate not being comfortable with self? My mother does not understand why I have read the Book of Mormon or the Koran (for example) if I am - for the lack of a better classification - a Christian. My mother is an educated woman, just a narrow minded one. I use her as an example because she fits a general mind set for the point I am trying to make. To her, what she believes is enough. She does not need to see another side, there is no other side, but isn’t that limiting? Isn’t that how stereotypes are born?  History of the worlds is taught in school for a reason. The most validated reason being if you visit a country outside your own it is good to know their customs, traditions, language and general way of life. What means red here may mean blue somewhere else. In that case good listening is not enough, you also have to understand what is being meant, but whose responsibility is it to understand both sides? Ideally it is everyone’s; believing in your own set of rules and appreciating the rules of others would be a moral standard that would allow us to see others as people and not preconceived notions. That again would be ideal. Reality, on the other hand, supposes that believing in one thing means disbelieving in something else. It has too, otherwise I would actually have to have faith in something or respect the differences of others and actually accept my own differences. Because isn’t that what stereotypes and prejudices are about - differences?   Our culture is a lax one. If we really paid attention we would notice how much we actually do stereotype one another. I was in the Arby’s drive-thru listening to Nickelback and the cashier screamed at me that I should turn to the Rap channel. All Black people do not listen to rap (I’m not one of those Blacks) and those who do, don’t necessarily listen to only rap. While driving through the homeless district, I was at the light when two homeless men, looking straggly and worn came toward my car and before I thought about it I had locked the doors. They never even looked my way. While reading Harry Potter I was told I was going to hell for devil worshipping. When I replied ‘If I am going to hell its not because of HP but rather this triple 6 I have burned onto my back’ I don’t think they appreciated my acerbic wit, but I didn’t appreciate their stereotype.   Unfortuantely, I can only control what I do and say. All the examples above took place in the course of half an hour. How many lives have been affected by the steretypical mumbo jumbo that we write off as 'just a joke'? Become conscious of who you are as well as what you say...

      I was reading threads on my favorite show and came across this comment:   I don’t understand why everyone is hung up on there being "no black people on this show." I understand that none of the main characters are black, but so what? Just because there aren’t any there it doesn’t make the show racist. It actually is more realistic, considering only about 12% of America's population is black, why should there be a black person in every frame or the show. Did Family Matters, the Cosby Show, or any other show about a cast of black people have any white leading roles? No! And you don’t hear any white people bitching about that. Also, every time there is a position of power on this show, have you noticed they almost always tend to be black? Like 2 out of 3 of Chandler's last bosses have all been black. When he goes to an interview, the guy is black, they do this all the time, because they cant introduce a new leading role 9 seasons into the show when they know its going to end a year later. Just a rant. I saw a comment on it in the paper the other day and just seeing what all you guys thin…Just for all the angry people whose feelings are hurt about the lack of color on Friends, the producers should extend the show for another 5 years and recast with all black actors and call it "Black Friends". But then that wouldn't be good enough either, would it?'   I think you would have to be black to understand sounds bad but its true. The phrase 'it's a black thing you wouldn't understand' plays deeply into this situation. I love Friends and I do mean love. I'm parked in front of the TV every Thursday watching, but as a Black person I am the exception not the rule. Most white people love the show because there is a character to identify with. That’s why Blacks have a problem with the lack of color as its being referred to here because where do we get to identify? Overall we shouldn't identify with the color but with the personality and that’s where we are losing out.   Yes Blacks have plenty of organizations but if you can not see where those are necessary, your view of this country in a whole is very naive. I love when white people say 'But Black People have BET and UPN' (which is like saying, riding in the back is better than not riding at all right?), yes you could say that but compare that to the other 200 channels that cater to the white demographic and we are still under represented as all minority groups are in this country. Is it right for ‘The Black’ shows to be just as narrow-minded? No, it’s not.  My personal opinion is that its television and nothing on TV should be taken this serious. But Art imitates life (yea I said it) and thus what does it say when one of the highest rated shows which has been on the air for 9 years and has only had 2 Blacks in main guest appearance roles (and those have been in the last two years)?

      Lesson 1  My father passed away on January 17, 2000 five days after I turned 21. My mother and I knew neither the cause nor the reason because that is how my father was. He believed his problems were just that, his, to bare and struggle with. He could not bare the feeling of loading his problems off on other people. His name was Atlas; any of you familiar with Greek mythology knows the character Atlas carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, as did my father.  I am the clone of my father in the female form. We were both conceited, arrogant, we walked the same, we talked alike even our handwriting is similar and like him I believe my problems are mine. To discuss them with someone is to give that person power over my weaknesses in the end. I promised my mother as well as myself I would open up more because sharing believe it or not is a necessity.  In relation to Harvey’s question of happiness sharing is pertinent.  Because I couldn't be happy without sharing apart of myself with others, no relationship could survive with both people being closed-ends. Maybe I should explain.  I had my own personal trials with searching for happiness. I thought I could find it within other people, within money, within friends, but I could not be happy until I was satisfied with myself. I moved out of my mother’s house, got a job I really didn't need, surrounded myself with men and friends and still cried at night because there was always something wrong.  After my father's death I secluded myself. I stuck my head in every book possible, I didn't call anyone, I didn't see anyone mainly because I wanted no one to see me. And one day I arrived. I arrived at a stage where I was not afraid I wasn't afraid to tell complete strangers my most intimate secrets because they can not hurt me, wasn't afraid to be myself, to open myself up completely because I realize it is your problem if you don't accept me. That is perfectly fine because I'm happy with myself if no one ever accepts me, I accept me.  So to answer your question Harvey, when I close my eyes I see the universe because that is just how wide my future is. I have been truly blessed with the opportunities of a lifetime and I didn't have to alter anything about my person for anyone to cater to me.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with being loved, as long as you are not compensating for loving yourself. Dew

      Lesson 1 I know a lot of you didn't get my first revelation, but now a lot of you will hear my second. First I'd like to say that it's 3:20am, I'm in Wisconsin on active Duty and I don't get off until 8am. So I've had time to really think over the last two weeks. Some of these things I'd like to talk about. As usual, please give me your feedback. Your thoughts along with mine bring understanding.  I can cry tears. Pain, joy, sadness. Even a stranger passing shows concern no matter the type. What of our internal tears. We all hold inside of us things we care not to share to the world. We let it grow and try to put it away, believing that it's nothing more than a passing experience. Why can we not share it to allow others the chance to learn. I admit I do have things I'd rather not share, but I'm open. If you ask me I will tell. We are secretive people, each with our own specific ways about us. But that's just a thought not my main subject.  My concern is with happiness. Do we look for what is best for us now or do we look for the best later? If we want something so bad we can reach for it. What if you reach only to see that it's so far away. We all have goals and dreams, but none of us want to come short of those goals. So what do we do? Give up or drive on. I know sometimes we settle for what we have, not sure if it's the best and afraid that nothing better is out there. Other times we have what's best but believe that something better is out there. What do we do? Life has so many twist and turns, but no signs on any roads.  For three years I have been without a "companion". Not until recently has it really started to bother me. My goal has seemed so close but when I stand there and look around no one is there. I question myself, but I realize I’m just me. I can only be loved for who I am. I stand with open arms waiting, patiently but carefully. I know God has a plan, but he just hasn't told me what it is. Am I wrong for wanting to be loved? Is it wrong to want to love? Close your eyes and see your future, Does it scare you?I know to some it may be hard to understand, but most of you are deep thinkers and can feel what I am saying. Open your minds and let this make you think. Let it help you observe. Allow it to make you love. Please again I ask for you thoughts.

      Innocence In response to innocence I agree wholeheartedly. The question is what has happened to trust? Answer it has depreciated into TOLERANCE. Out of all the people you know you may only trust 2 of them and tolerate the rest of them. Why? Convenience. This person has cool conversion but you know they shady, that person is cute but stupid, this person is cool but ugly, so as people you do not want to invest the time to expand the knowing of this or that person so that you can learn to trust them. It's so much easier to use you for what you are worth to me and not invest the time it takes to get to know you. Cuz in turn that means you begin to know me and dare I have too many people who know me, because then I become vulnerable.  What if I MISTRUST you? That means you can turn against me and in doing so you have a secret weapon- my own little dirty secrets. And I can't have that. There's no way you can know about my personal skeletons. Then you know I'm not as GOOD as I want you to think I am (or perceive I am). Then you begin to see me for the dirty birdy I've tried so hard and so long to keep you from seeing. But what I don't realize is that I'm so fouled up on my own insecurities that I don't realize you have secrets just like me. You have problems and skeletons of your own, so why am I so shaken?  Because you no longer PERCIEVE me in the way of innocence. I can't pretend I don't know about or I haven't heard or I didn't see, I can't pretend I haven't done or haven't used any and everything I can no longer LIE for the sake of innocence. Why though? If you must lie about it, why do it? Cause it feels good. Cause I enjoy doing it. Then why lie about it? Because society tells me I'm dirty for doing it. Not just sex, but the cursing the gambling, the drinking, the promiscuity, all of it thrills me, yet I know if you find out I’m no longer an exception, I'm no longer special because I don't; I'm no longer popular for being different. And dare I not be popular.  The one thing most people fear more than death is the fear of being alone. Therefore I will tolerate Shady Susie and Lying Lewis so I won't be alone. I'll lie about myself to form an image of someone you will accept into your realm of lies (think about it). I'll lower my own standards to be higher in your regards, because dare I be alone, dare I stand on my own 2 feet, dare I educate myself, dare I tell the truth and you accept me for who I am. DARE I BE AN INDIVIDUAL.  We're a selfish generation we want to be loved but not give as much love, we want to work but not that much, we want to be felt and not feel, be helped but not help. Aristotle said it best "In friendship loving is far more greater than being loved". You can not trust anyone else until you trust yourself, you can not love until you love yourself, and indulgence in some cases is a wonderful thing but if you have to lie about your indulging you may want to consider abstaining. If you know you'll regret it why do it? Dew

      Innocence Whatever happened to trust? I was sitting here wondering why is it that nowadays, more than ever, people lie. Is it something in the water? At what point in time did it become ok to do this? I believe it has a lot to do with the way people want to be perceived. In an effort for others to accept them they feel that a lie is the way to achieve that goal. Why worry about what someone else perceives. When and if they see the "lie" they begin to act differently anyway. This is the problem with relationships today. They come based on lies. These lies become evident inside the relationship. This brings about the saying, "You've changed". In all actuality they haven't changed, it's just the lie isn't being maintained.  Who do we point the finger to? Of course we all would say the opposite-sex, but is this really the answer? Let us look at both. Who can honestly say I haven't seen or heard a friend lie. Who can honestly say they haven’t told a lie to build a relationship. Honestly in meeting a person that seems to be your potential "friend"(a term I will discuss later) our goal is to impress. At this point we tend to believe that bending the truth maybe a little will help us obtain that goal. Understand what I'm saying now. The unsaid answer, the little grin instead of saying no, the avoiding of questions. This is not keeping it real. If I can't be honest with you now, all I'm doing is making it harder on myself down the road.  Now the "friend" issue. Now more than ever the term friend is in use. To have a friend suggest that I do have someone I kick it with. This can go from just telephone conversations to sex every other night. A friend is saying I have no commitment to this person so I can do as I please. I'll call etc. In some cases we see more than one friend in the picture. What do we call a man with more than one friend? Personally I see it as a way to escape commitment. Everyone says they're young and have time. Well if you ask a few people on this campus who thought the same, but were victims of an unexpected case of herpes, they seem to see it differently. Don't get me wrong, live your life party if that’s what you like, but if you're not committed then your friend isn't either. It's so much out there nowadays and there is no way to protect yourself 100%.  I was just sitting here and all these things rushed into my mind. It was just something I really think about from day to day. I see it, I live it. The only things I trust are Goodfella.s.s. and my dogg. This is only because I know them. I personally think this is a good conversation topic also. So what are your views?   Harvey "Spike" Lee Thompson "Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining"  Goodfella.s.s. 4life

      My company has relocated us to a new, more modern and highly secure building. Every morning I run, literally, down to the cafeteria for breakfast. We have been warned: not to eat at our desk, not to have drinks at our desk, any food must be consumed in the cafeteria. We are  urged  to sit in the front of the cafe, not to fraternized (read: bother) anyone from other departments and any food left from the meal must be disposed of before returning to the floor. Anyone caught with food at their desk will be reprimanded. For food?   The building we just left, I agree was nasty, but they had been in that building upwards of 8 years of course it was going to be nasty, especially when you only have 1 person cleaning in behind 500.   I understand their train of thought: Keep this new building new. But is treating adults like children really going to accomplish this?  You can see people at their desk choking on crumbs when management walks by. Nabs are hidden in the far crevices of desk drawers. Should people really fear losing their job if they spill water? (And yes it really is that serious)  The saddest part is the walk to the cafeteria. You have to take the elevator down to the Plaza and then walk through the hub, 1/4 mile, to get to the cafe. The hub is basically the stock hall. Everything that doesn't work or has no more use is stored there(Cletus are you trying to tell me something?). The hub is straight out of a major motion thriller. It leaks. Its dark. You can hear unidentified movements lurking behind unaccessible doors. Did I mention my department is the only section that has to use the hub? To take the conspiracy theory even further, our access to floors and doors that would be quicker en route to the cafe is off limits.   The major issue is that, none of the other departments are under such strict guidelines. And it is causing quite the issue in the office. We feel like we are the step children of the company. Whenever we attempt to address our discourse it is simply implied "Be glad you have a job!" Is that truly the right response? What about work morale? They are doing nothing to improve it but they continue to expect outstanding results.   Managers patrol the floor looking for any sign of edible contraband. That lets me know that my job has to be expendible if   this   is all you have to do all day!   Whats even worse than us being the children under the stairs is the cleaning people in the building are treated even worse. They sit on the far side of the cafeteria in nothing less then a corner, where they are instructed to sit. They sit by themselves, too themselves. If we make eye contact (as is the Southern way) they speak then proceed on their way with heads down. Why aren't we able to mingle amongst one another? What separates management from us and us from them besides title and responsibility? And the most important question would I have even noticed had I not been in the same position as them?

      At first I will admit I did not think I had anything to contribute but that was short lived. Right now I am still working through my voice. I am a creative writer. I am not used to writing a direct opinion with out putting a metaphor in front of it. Of course I will rise to the occasion, I am just attempting to find the correct voice to do so.   In the meantime the studio audience will have to settle for my rantings on whatever the mood strikes.

      How can anyone say they enjoyed this movie. I wanted to walk out on it but I am a miser who refuses to admit defeat. The movie opens with Jenny Garth and Pam Anderson is some dumb blonde dialogue that is cliche and utterly stupid and I don't mean funny-stupid. After Jenny hands Pam the phone and its a play Smiegal from The Lord of the Rings asking for his Precious which turns out to be Pam's Mother, she ventures back down the hall where the light have all gone out and Jenny Garth has become post mortem in five minutes and Pam just stands over her calling her name, despite the fact her head has rolled on the floor. Hard as it was for you to read that sentence it was harder for me to watch it!  Its obvious the Wayans Brothers didn't produce this film even the race jokes are horrible. The spin on 8mile is first of all too late and secondly dumb! The crowd is some gun packing mob that the farmer boy, George, has to win over with his plea to be accepted despite his lack melanin. The rhymes were mediocre at best even to be a spoof and the general tone was too conspicuous. You knew what the next joke would be.   The only comic relief in this film is the little boy, Cody, who is abuse prone and psychic in his ability. As he walks thru the living room pointing at a pregnant lady and telling her "It's a boy. He'll be an asshole " Then he gets to a man smoking a cigarette and forewarns him "Smoke all you want, you going to get hit by a bus." The next man is wearing a toupee and he advises "You're not fooling anyone."  Sadly enough the funniest part of the movie and the only part that remotely warranted a chuckle the human ear could actually hear was when Cody 'sees' for a couple coming out of the restroom, obviously from making out; he says to the man "You're going to get lucky tonite." To the Woman: "He doesn't know you're a man."  All in all, save your money the movie is trash. This is an hour or so of your life you will regret not being able to get back.

      Besides the fact that what you are about to read makes absolute since, the main reason I am posting it on Dew Process is because of the style Prince used to relay the actual message. I read this post originally on  urlLink Blogcritics  and the three comments left  about it were all  in irritation of the short forms of words he used in the passage.   The fact that I work for a wireless company and decipher these messages all day long aside. The main thing here is that Prince is keeping to his non-conformist principles. You think about a man who walked around with a Slave tat on his face, changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol, and wore ass-less chaps. The simplest of things in his arsenal is untraditional spelling.   One of the comments left on the post claims "It's one thing in songs - a signature I guess - but in prose writing it's just irritating." What the commenter may not realize is that Prince is beyond passionate about his expression. He wants to relay his message  his way  and those 'touched' enough to receive it are the chosen few. His creativity  is  his signature and he exudes that in every facet of his being. In other words there is no difference between prose and his signature, they are one in the same because  he  is the common denominator.   Most would say such a non-conforming attitude is dangerous especially when you are trying to relay a message to others, but as proven by the comments left, the reader conformed to him in order to receive the message and that is true power.       Something happened on the way 2 the 21st century. Media and entertainment companies started &#8220;converging&#8221; and &#8220;shareholder value&#8221; became far more important than customer service and respect 4 company employees ever managed 2 b. Compensation packages 4 company xecutives hit the stratosphere &#8212; while holding them accountable 4 their company&#8217;s results became nearly impossible.   These xecutives r indeed very naÃ¯ve if they think that people haven&#8217;t noticed.   People r noticing that something isn&#8217;t quite right &#8212; that something is indeed very wrong. After a decade during which the stock market gained apparent respectability as a legitimate, sensible 4m of investing, the recent slew of huge corporate scandals reveals that it is still what it has always been: a sick place where neurotic, puerile gamblers get their kicks off the backs of millions of &#8220;anonymous&#8221; workers and individuals, who have no control over what happens 2 their hard-earned retirement savings.   Yet this is the place that most company xecutives feel is much more important 2 watch than the actual people 4 whom they produce their goods and services. This is the place where the fate of thousands of employees is decided every day by people staring at computer monitors showing ever-changing, meaningless lists of numbers and charts. And if u happen 2 personally hold shares in a company that has just announced that it is &#8220;restructuring&#8221; in order 2 improve its bottom-line and thus increase its &#8220;shareholder value&#8221;, don&#8217;t kid urself: When the company is talking about &#8220;shareholders&#8221;, it&#8217;s not talking about u and ur measly couple of thousands of shares. It&#8217;s only talking about big shareholders &#8212; i.e. other companies that own a more significant share of its market value.   This is a world where &#8220;hostile takeovers&#8221; and government-approved &#8220;mergers&#8221; r feeding a never-ending cycle of fewer and fewer xecutives wielding more and more power on a multinational scale. Soon enough, the &#8220;World Company&#8221; and George Orwell&#8217;s 1984 will no longer b the stuff of satire or fiction &#8212; but prophetic descriptions of a very real &#8220;New World Order&#8221; gradually unfolding b4 r eyes.   A Little History Let&#8217;s start with a simple list: America Online, Time, Life, Warner Bros., Fortune, Elektra, Sports Illustrated, HBO, Turner Broadcasting, CNN, Cinemax, Entertainment Weekly, New Line Cinema, In Style, Warner/Chappell Music, Time Warner Cable, WBN, ICQ, Warner Music Group, Netscape, People, Reprise, Rhino, Atlantic, WEA, TNT, MapQuest, WinAmp, In Demand, Erato, Moviefone, Road Runner, etc. All owned by the same corporate giant (AOL Time Warner).   And another one: Universal Music Group, Verve, Nathan, Canal+, Impulse!, Cegetel, USA Networks, Decca, Interscope, Geffen, A&M, Barclay, Armand Colin, L&#8217;Express, Universal Studios, Larousse, Sierra, MP3.com, MCA Records, Deutsche Grammophon, Cineplex, etc. All owned by the same corporate giant (Vivendi Universal).   And yet another one: Disney, ABC, ESPN, Hyperion, Miramax, Touchstone, Hollywood Pictures, A&E, The History Channel, E! Entertainment, RTL-2, Buena Vista, Mr. Showbiz, Wall of Sound, Mammoth Records, etc. All owned by the same corporate giant (Walt Disney).   Need we say more? See 4 urself&#8230; There&#8217;s already only 7 of these corporate giants in total &#8212; and how long will it b b4 there r even fewer?   It all began innocently enough. Young entrepreneurs in the early 20th century started up new companies with a mix of creative ambition and business acumen. Then these companies grew bigger and bigger, and whatever entrepreneurial vision was present at their birth became more and more diluted and less and less relevant. Then corporate accountants suggested merging with or taking over other companies &#8212; and it all became an all-2-real game of Monopoly.   Then the Internet and &#8220;new technologies&#8221; came about, and the accountants&#8217; next big idea was convergence &#8212; i.e. the merging of &#8220;content&#8221; providers and &#8220;access&#8221; providers in order 2 control everything from the inception of a &#8220;cultural product&#8221; 2 its ultimate consumption by the unsuspecting masses.   The Art of Manipulation It is easy 2 guess what got lost along the way&#8230; Creativity. Artistry. Independence. Critical objectivity. Uncontrolled access. The ability 2 &#8220;break thru&#8221; cultural barriers. Cultural diversity. Innovation. Freedom. Real music. Real art.   Juggling between art and commerce is a delicate balance at the best of times&#8230; and these r definitely NOT the best of times.   So now we have a so-called magazine &#8220;reporting&#8221; on the latest new blockbuster movie with a 10-page, full-color spread &#8212; as if the reporters weren&#8217;t aware that the same company that produced the movie also owns their magazine&#8230; Yes, this is still called a &#8220;magazine&#8221;. These r still called &#8220;reporters&#8221;. And this is still called &#8220;journalism&#8221;&#8230; And yet millions of people r gleefully letting themselves b had.   Maybe we should stop calling this &#8220;art&#8221;, or even &#8220;entertainment&#8221; 4 that matter &#8212; 4 what is so entertaining about being involved in a collective hallucination? Maybe we should start calling it what it really is, i.e. unfettered MANIPULATION.   In 1995, Clear Channel Communications owned 43 radio stations. Now it owns more than 1,200 &#8212; and its army of so-called &#8220;independent promoters&#8221; r letting legalized payola dictate what u get (or rather don&#8217;t get) 2 hear on the radio.   Everywhere u look, the story is the same: more and more money, less and less choice, less and less freedom of access, fewer and fewer companies. How far will this have 2 go b4 a big shift in people&#8217;s attitude causes this commercial hubris 2 collapse on2 itself and implode?   Power Struggles The first major cracks in this highly concentrated corporate world have, of course, already begun 2 appear, in what has been making the headlines in the past few months, i.e. shady accounting practices involving enormous amounts of money &#8212; enough 2 shake the economy of the most powerful nation of the world. And the hysterical stock markets have of course been swayed by this news, at the xpense of tens of thousands of workers worldwide and millions of small investors who thought that their holdings had nowhere 2 go but up.   The value of AOL Time Warner&#8217;s stock is now a quarter of what it was at the time of the merger between AOL and Time Warner, and this decline 4ced the company 2 take a $54 billion writedown earlier this year. And now it 2 is being investigated about its accounting practices. The story at Vivendi Universal is similar. Disney shares r near an 8-year low. And there is little doubt in people&#8217;s mind that the problems r similar everywhere, in every big conglomerate that has become utterly out of touch with the reality of everyday work and the essence of human creativity.   In addition, people also realize all 2 well that governments have little &#8212; if any &#8212; power left when it comes 2 regulating these multinational monsters. Governments have much more power when it comes 2 regulating the lives of ordinary, law-abiding citizens &#8212; and they use and abuse this power as a way 2 distract people&#8217;s attention from how much control the conglomerates have over what we get 2 hear, watch, read, eat, drink, buy, and generally xperience as &#8220;free&#8221; citizens of the world.   One of the areas where this struggle is most acutely felt is, of course, the online world &#8212; a sprawling, anarchic community that is still in its infancy and whose xponential development in the last decade took everyone by surprise. And nothing xemplifies the struggle between government, big business, and individual rights better than the highly controversial issue of &#8220;peer-2-peer&#8221; file sharing and its many digital variations.   A Nation of Thieves? Will the media/technology giants recover from the latest stock market slump? They probably will &#8212; but at what cost? In all likelihood, the cost will b more &#8220;restructuring&#8221;, more layoffs, more xecutive shuffles and golden parachutes, causing even further alienation from their own employees and customers. And this, in turn, will further encourage the very behaviors that they claim r illegal and want punished by criminal law &#8212; all the while preserving their own impunity as they continue 2 carelessly flounder a capital that they do not own.   Napster may have gone bankrupt and become a closed chapter in the Internet&#8217;s short history, but its death is by no means a reflection of a decline in peer-2-peer (P2P) file sharing, quite the contrary. If anything, P2P has grown even further &#8212; but since it&#8217;s becoming totally decentralized, there is no easy way 2 measure its significance.   What is 4 sure, however, is that, in spite of its many claims 2 the contrary, the recording industry has yet 2 provide evidence that P2P is actually detrimental 2 music making as an artistic endeavor, and even as a commercial venture. It is worth remembering, 4 xample, that sales of music CDs actually increased when Napster was at its peak, and declined after Napster was abruptly shut down. Even economists who thought that file sharing &#8220;should b&#8221; hurting the recording industry r now xpressing their doubts, based on what they say is simply not happening.   More importantly, many well-respected artists have sided with Internet users against corporate greed and actually use the Internet 2 promote alternative ways 2 distribute their music and reach out 2 a non-captive, legitimate audience of authentic music lovers.   This does not mean, of course, that all 4ms of file sharing r equally innocuous. There is little doubt that, when people use the Internet as a substitute 4 radio, i.e. as a way 2 discover new music, it can help promote the work of artists. But when a young junior high school student downloads tracks off the Internet and makes CD-R copies of them that he then sells 4 $5 in the schoolyard, it hurts sales of the original CD and it&#8217;s disrespectful of the artist &#8212; regardless of how small a cut of the actual CD price the artist actually gets after all the xecutives and the middlemen in the recording industry have taken their piece of the pie.   Still, can we really go as far as 2 say that digital technology is creating a &#8220;nation of thieves&#8221; who no longer recognize the just value of art?   Protecting the Product It is worth noting, 2 begin with, that the recording industry itself is far from having distinguished itself by recognizing the true value of art. Instead, it has consistently fought 2 b allowed 2 deprive many artists of their most fundamental rights. It has allowed popular artists 2 go bankrupt even though their albums were selling by the millions. It has reduced the artists&#8217; cut of the album sales pie 2 a ridiculously small portion of the actual income generated by these sales. It has consistently pushed commercial musical products at the xpense of real musical artistry.   This hardly entitles the recording industry 2 lecture anyone about recognizing the just value of art.   It is also interesting 2 note that the cultural products that seem 2 b the primary concern of the industry giants r those that r already the most popular ones, and that things such as CD copy protection r being xperimentally used mostly with items that will sell millions regardless of whether they r copy-protected or not.   So r most citizens really being completely disrespectful of the value of art and the need 2 provide appropriate compensation 2 the artists 4 their works? We&#8217;ve said it b4 and we&#8217;ll say it again: the rise of digital technology and peer-2-peer file sharing has little 2 do with people&#8217;s intrinsic respect 4 art and artists, and everything 2 do with the cynical attitude of big industry conglomerates, which have consistently pushed 4 more and more commercial, highly profitable products at the xpense of authentic art and respect 4 artists.   If people do not feel enough guilt 2 prevent them from making digital copies of the latest episode of a popular TV show or hit pop song, it is precisely because the industry giants have succeeded in making these works purely commercial products, with little or no consideration 4 their actual artistic value. It is precisely because these companies have been consistently promoting commercial products at the xpense of artistic works.   The fact that actual works of art still manage 2 seep thru the cracks of this huge profit-driven industry does not change anything about the fundamental equations that have been driving and still drive the industry, 2day more than ever &#8212; i.e. that art = money, artists = money-makers, and art lovers = consumers.   As a simple xample of how little music is valued as an art 4m by the industry, it is estimated that only about 20 percent of music ever recorded is currently available &#8212; and, of this 20 percent, what proportion is actually readily available 2 music lovers? What proportion is not the current 100 top albums on the SoundScan charts?   It simply appears that the instinctive reaction of the lover of art (b it music, TV shows, movies, or other 4ms of art) is such that, if the industry has no respect 4 his or her identity as an appreciator of art, then he or she has no reason 2 have any respect 4 the industry as a purveyor of art. By making digital copies of so-called cultural products, many people r not demonstrating their lack of respect 4 art and 4 artists, but r xpressing &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; their frustration with the way the entertainment industry profits from art at the xpense of both art makers and art lovers.   The consumers of the commercial products of the entertainment industry r only as cynical as the industry has deliberately made them, by dumbing down their products, by xploiting artists, by making profit-driven choices and decisions, and by providing their own kind with obscene compensations and legal impunity that r completely out of touch with the real world of ordinary people.   Don&#8217;t Get It Twisted That being said, the whole debate about file sharing and digital piracy is, most of all, a convenient way 4 industry conglomerates 2 deflect attention from their own shady business practices and dubious alliances.   4 xample, it is worth noting that the Warner Music Group is heavily involved in the recording industry&#8217;s fight against piracy, but that its own parent company, AOL Time Warner, is directly benefiting from file sharing, as a provider of Internet access 2 millions of Internet users worldwide. When AOL Time Warner repeatedly flaunts its ever-increasing number of members (34 million and counting) and the billions of hours that they spend online, is there any doubt that a good part of this growth involves the &#8220;unlawful&#8221; xchange of computer files at the detriment of recording artists?   In other words, the real &#8220;thieves&#8221; r not necessarily those that r currently getting the blame&#8230; Rather than a &#8220;nation of thieves&#8221;, the current situation looks, 2 us, much more like an &#8220;elite of thieves&#8221;.   And the real victims of this thievery r very much, as usual, the recording artists themselves, who will never get their share of AOL&#8217;s profits as an Internet access provider, even though these profits r partly based on the content that they originally provided. And the real victims also include authentic music lovers, who already suffer from restricted access 2 the full range of music that they would like 2 xplore, and who r also likely 2 suffer from technological restrictions that will soon prevent them from making legitimate copies of the works that they have lawfully purchased 4 their own enjoyment.   Make no mistake: the entertainment industry (including TV, movies and music) might b big, but the technology industry is even bigger. Remember that it is AOL that bought Time Warner, and not the other way around. Remember that Sony makes much more money in electronics and computer equipment than it does in record sales&#8230;   If the technology industry ends up implementing technological limitations that prevent users from lawfully enjoying their purchases &#8212; as it is threatening 2 do &#8212; the beneficiaries will not b the artists whose works r thus being allegedly &#8220;protected&#8221;. And it will certainly not b the art lovers whose enjoyment of art will thus b restricted. No, it will simply b, once again&#8230; the industry conglomerates, who will have yet another generation of incompatible media and devices 2 sell 2 us under the guise of &#8220;technological improvement&#8221;.   Conclusion The technology and entertainment industries r simply 2 big 4 us 2 xpect any overnight changes. The industry giants will continue 2 do their best 2 deflect people&#8217;s attention away from their own wrongdoings and 2 blame falling profits and commercial failures on piracy at the same time that they r encouraging their customers 2 adopt the very technologies that make piracy possible. Artists will continue 2 b lured by unrealistic promises and contracts with big numbers and lots of small print.   How long, however, b4 a critical mass of established artists realize that it is in their best interests, both artistically and commercially, 2 leave the system 4 good? How long b4 a critical mass of young aspiring artists become aware of the enslaving aspects of the system and r careful not 2 get involved in it without a maximum of precautions? And how long b4 a critical mass of art lovers get 2gether 2 provide these artists with a real, valuable, legitimate, truthfully enthusiastic alternative audience that completes the process of rendering the xisting system artistically irrelevant?   It all depends on us &#8212; and it all depends on u.    (Prince article copied from  urlLink Blogcritics . Originally posted by  urlLink Eric Olsen .)

      What's real for me right now is the anticipation of Matrix Revolutions. While I loved Reloaded I do not believe it touched its predecessor in sentimentality, form or depth. Quite frankly The Matrix was at its debut something we had not seen before. Therefore the sequel could not surpass it simply because of chronology not quality.   At any rate, I loved Reloaded but like Kill Bill Vol. 1 it left a lot to be desired. Which is all the more reason I will have my ticket in advance and make sure I am front and center for Revolutions.   I bought Reloaded on DVD Last week and have watched it only once, just to get a taste of desire for the final installment. I am beyond curious to see it will all end.   For me, the movies captured my hunger for asking questions. It allowed me to open a new realm of what reality is and isn't.  Or more abstractly what I perceive as reality. Which if you consider the very definition of reality, having to perceive reality raises its own validity.   Hmmmm

      The world of Blogging used to be a fascinating place to me. I have encountered the trolls, the sympathetics, the empathetics and the devils; advocates, that is. All in all it has been a feverish run. A run I have come to be weary of.   The fame of a blogger lives and breathes on his or her opinion.  But I'm not looking to be famous. I am looking to provoke thought and insight. I was not being fulfilled thru my then current run of blog outlets. Partially because I was too concerned with the reaction before I could complete the provocation, which in turn stifled my writing.   I am not sure I am done blogging. The standard I had set for myself is currently out of reach. Sadly enough I am speaking in quality not quantity. I do not feel I have anything effective to say right now. When actually I know I do.   When I get over whatever this stump is I will return but right now I just do not have the energy to run with the pack.  10/31/03 No promises. Just out of pocket.

      In the next 6 months I plan to be in the position to get a new car. So accordingly I have started researching the vehivcle that will be eligible for that purchase. For a long time I have been in love with Honda Accords. I think they are reliable and sterdy and for the most part all Consumer Reports have nothing bad to say about the dependability of Honda.   At least I felt that way until wandering to the  urlLink Honda   site to build a price my new Accord, I noticed they had a new vehicle in the mist. Its name was Element and I can't let go. Yes ladies and germs I am high on 'E' for Element, of course.    Starting price for Elements are around $16,510. The model I want is EX 4WD with Front Side Airbags in Sunset Orange Pearl. It is priced at $21,100.00 + $490.00 destination and handling.    Technical Features      160-hp 2.4 liter DOHC i-VTEC 4 cylinder engine   Real Time 4-Wheel Drive   Unit Body Construction    4-Wheel Independent Suspension   4-Wheel Disc Break   Anti-lock Braking System with Electronic Brake Distribution   110, 000 mile scheduled tune-up interval   4-speed automatic transmission    Safety Features      Dual-stage front airbags   3-point seatbelts at all seating positions   Front 3-point seatbelts with automatic tensioning system   Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children    Immobilizer theft Deterrent system   Side-impact door beams    Interior Features      270-watt AM/FM/CD audio system with 7 speakers including subwoofer   MP3/digital media auxiliary jack   Air conditioning with air-filtration system   Power front windows with auto-up/down driver's window   Power door and tailgate locks   Urethane-coated utility floor   Waterproof FXCâ„¢ (For Extreme Conditions) seat fabric   Removable, flip-up rear seats   Fold-flat capable seating    Exterior Features      Side cargo doors   Composite body panels   Clamshell tailgate   Rear privacy glass   16" alloy wheels   Multi-reflector halogen headlights   Certain features have probably let on that this is not a car (SUV?) expected of my demographic. The core audience they were looking for were white males under 35. Being a Black female under 25 has pretty much shot that demographic off the scale. Seriously though the vehicle is selling well but it is to older white men.   To be quite honest I think the truck is ugly but it is unique and scarcely scene, so I identify with its uniqueness, I revel it to a point. There is currently no 2004 model available and there won't be at least until January '04. The only changes they have made is that the keyless entry and security system will be standard along with the driver side armrest.

      I have found solace and its name is grouphug.us. The site is centered around confessing your deepest darkest secret for no other than reason than tension-release.    I had a friend to tell me about this site where people anonymously reveal their worse secrets and confess their greatest sins. The site does not record names or ask for any personal info other than your volunteered confession. This site is governed by simple rules:   the purpose of this site is not to tell funny stories or be as vulgar as possible. the point isn't to get a thrill on posting lies about you and your livestock. the purpose, if there is one, is to offer a little bit of relief from your conscience. this web site is not a message board or an open forum. we'd love it if you would cooperate just a bit.   the following is an incomplete list of things that will probably not make it through our crack team of confession-readers:     gratuitous vulgarity (more than is neccessary to communicate your message)  known urban myths  all capitals  obnoxious use of non-alpha characters (such as smiley faces)  creative spacing and line-breaks  obvious lies  bragging  confessions about this site  confessions that are not about you  responses to other confessions  names  phone numbers  addresses  email addresses  web site addresses    the type of confession that will nearly always be included is the type where you simply place your cursor in the little box and type a note about a fault of your own, something you did or thought about and are not proud of.     Scrolling thru some of the confessions you get a mixture bad decisions and devilish evils. All in all its just fun to read and relaxing to write.  urlLink Why not confess?

      Please do not get my wrong. Private Jessica Lynch has endured much in the last year but I must ask what has she done that is so heroic? Her troops or platoon, crew, whatever they are called this week, went the wrong way and they were ambushed. Sad, I admit. She was taken hostage possibly raped, shot and tormented I'm sure. But what did she do to receive so much publicity. She was rescued she is not the rescuer.   When 9/11 happened you heard tales of heroism left and right, not that the 'saved' melted quietly into the back ground; it was just that the tales of comradory and altruism were pushed to the forefront. In a time when the event was so horrrific and uncalled for it was the acts of bravery that gave you a bright side.   Again I am not minimalizing what Lynch endured but I am curious as to why we are paying homage to her rather than those who saved her or the man who risked his life to tip us off.   This entire ordeal with this war has been plagued with unanswered questions. You get a sense of 'don't know, don't tell' all around it. Yet the bright side can still be seen.  All these men and women of our military put themselves out there (yes they had a choice I know a few cowards sitting on the AWOL) to carry out there duty and that is admirable regardless of the circumstance so lets pay tribute to them all equally.

      I was reading all the bad reviews for this movie and I just do not understand. This movie was excellent. It had all the elements: action, drama, suspense. How could you not love it, unless you didn't understand it?    The bottom line is people don't understand it. So this is a crash course for anyone who wants answers. Real one's, not some fanboys idea of what it's about. Please note, SPOILERS ARE ALL THROUGH THIS REVIEW.  Here we go with the basics.  Zion is real! The Matrix is not.   The Matrix was designed to provide a mental stimulus for the human bodies connected to the machines as a source of power. This is the sixth version of the Matrix. There have been multiple versions of the Matrix because of a flaw in the program (kinda of like Windows). That flaw is giving individuals the ability to choose.  The first Matrix was designed as a perfect uptopia (see pt. I - Smith explains it to Morpheus; pt. II - The Architect explains it again) but humans did not accept it as real so they just kept waking up. It was redesigned to reflect our civilization at it's last stage before it was taken over by the machines (the year 1999).  The Architect's problem with this new design (the anomoly)of the Matrix is that it require individuals to think freely, i.e. choice. It was the Oracle that suggested he redesign the Matrix in this way. But since humans have choices, so must the programs sent to watch over them, i.e. The Agents, thus bringing us the problem that is Mr. Smith. In Reloaded, The Architect continues to speak of the anomoly he is unable to get rid of, which is why at some point, he feels the only solution is to destroy the Matrix and those who are aware of it (the people of Zion) and start from scratch again.   The Oracle says it clearly in Revolutions. Mr. Smith is the result of the anomoly trying to balance itself. Mr. Smith began to think freely (see part I where he is freaking out while interrogating Morpheous) and the result was a negative one. Realize this, he is a similar program to the One so he is far more dangerous than a normal individual who makes bad decisions. Mr. Smith's virus like behavior happened in EVERY VERSION OF THE MATRIX. The result would always lead to the same thing -- a system crash if they didn't quickly reboot the system. The same knee jerk reaction you have when you realize someone has sent you a virus.  The One program was created to solve this problem. But each version of the One ultimately failed. Neo is different, in Reloaded he choose the door that led to Trinity, not the door that RESETS the program. Note: The Architect even noticed that Neo's experience in the Matrix was different than all the rest, realizing he was the first of them to fall in love.  Onto Revolutions:  Neo's choice has changed everything. The system is still threatened by Smith's behavior, so the Oracle makes a new choice; one she has never done before because no version of the One has ever chosen the difficult path as opposed to easy one of just resetting the system. She allows herself to become merged with Smith in the HOPE that she'll be able to help Neo when the time is right.  Neo makes another unique choice. He goes to the machines and asks for PEACE as opposed to simply destroying the system by going through the opposite door as all other versions of the One did. It was a simple as that to save Zion. Machines don't need very long to process that this may be a better idea than just constantly resetting the system.  At the end, Smith says to Neo the movies tagline - "Everything that has a beginning has an end," as the Oracle is speaking to Neo through Smith. Neo realizes it all along, the only way to end this is to sacrifice himself. The Oracle noted that Neo and the Source (the computer mainframe, the Architect they're all one and the same so don't get confused) are connected which is why he can control machines outside the Matrix. He uses this connection to his advantage. He becomes a Mr. Smith and since all the Smith's are connected, the Source now has a lock on Smith and simply deletes him. Pretty simple huh?  For those that like to dig deeper, than note the biblical references throughout the series. Heck, the French Man (Merovigchian) is the Devil, just read the elevator button Morpheous presses when he goes to see him for the second time. The Architect represents God - i.e. the creator of the world and its destroyer whenever things don't go as he wants. He even has you to chose a select group of people to restart Zion again sort of like Noah's Ark. Neo is Jesus, the one who realizes that peace and love is the answer, not war. And the Oracle represents the Holy Spirit - the conciousness that resides in all of us. It's a deep trilogy if you PAY ATTENTION.    (Originally posted at Yahoo!

      I went to cast my unnecessary vote today (sarcasm party of one) and the attendant obviously was only there for show. They voting booths were set up under the light so of course I saw more glare than screen.  I hit the wrong candidate for the most important ballot, Govenor.  I asked the attendant, more politely than she deserved, how to cancel the selection?  "You can't, sorry"  Just so you get an idea, stand up spin around and talk at the same time. How in the hell can you effectively answer a question if you didn't take the time to listen to it? I stood there fiddling with this machine thinking if I screw it up what difference would it make, my vote has already been jeopardized. Something said just reselect the incorrect choice, I did, and then I was able to move on with a calm state of mind.   After I was done voting I searched for the attendant so let her know of my new findings. When I explained to her that all you had to do was reselect the choice, she just looked at me with this look on her face that more than let me know I was not the first person she had give the wrong answer too.  I'm pissed about that. I'm pissed about the fact that someone left there thinking there was no way to correct there vote. Haley Barbour may now be in office because of it.

      At 410am Wednesday morning I will be nestled in a theatre seat watching Matrix Revolutions. Is that bad? Is it worse that I am already committed to see it again at 4pm with my best friend and again Saturday with my ex-boyfriend?   I saw Reloaded a total of six times. That is just before it left the theatre. So to say the least I am definitely a fan of the franchise.   I moved shortly after I bought the game so I did not get a chance to beat it (all my things are in storage other than my computer and my playstation...my preccccciiiiooouuussss). At any rate I am beyond excited. I will probably end up seeing the movie per friend probably all except T since she still isn't talking to me. But I am beyond excited about this last installment.   Whoa!

      Child: I found out today one of my classmates from High School is about to have her 5th child. Not to mention she's younger than I am. I just don't understand what makes her so different. I look at some of the people I have known or grew up with and I wonder why am I so different.   Mother: You're different because of the choices you made.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Realization is a bitch!

       Movies    1.   Anything Else   - The movie was pretentious and honest, would you expect anything else from Woody Allen. It's a story of two New York Love Birds, one in love with being in love, the other in love with the thrill of having men love her. It's a must see that most did not.    2.   Matrix III   - Most will not agree but this movie was simply excellent. It had all the elements; drama, action, contempt, sacrifice and unconditional love. How could you not love it. It was far more simplistic than Reloaded and it left you fulfilled, even if the fulfillment was resentment.    3.   Mona Lisa Smile   - This movie pissed me off! For that alone it deserves it's spot on the list. I sat in the theatre lost in the characters and their choices (or lack there of). Julia Roberts played her character well but it was Kirsten Dunst that you kept your eye on waiting for her character to evolve. This story showcased the '50s woman, placing her in one of two threshholds conformed or confronted, sinner or saint. You hated to love it but it was all worthwhile.     4.   X Men United   - This movie was sick for lack of a better term. It set up what was dawned the Action packed summer. When Nightcrawler burst thru 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as nothing more than a blue puff of smoke, you sat up in your seat and took notice. There was less character development and more action which is what you want from a comic remake; X-Men 2 more than delivered.    5.   LOTR Return of the King   - You knew it was here, you were looking for it. This movie capped off what will go down in history as one of the biggest epics to hit film - ever. Although not many movies will ever accomplish the task of dominating the book, this series definitely gives the adage a run for its money. I have not and more than likely will not read the books for LOTR but I will own and cherish the story for a long time. This movie picks up as Frodo and Sam get closer to Mordor, Smeagol has allowed his alter ego Gullom to overcome him once more and all mankind is still threatened by the all seeing eye.   When you actually witness the rise and return of the king you are filled with emotion. It touches you to see him reunited with his love especially after denying a well deserved suitress. The movie like Matrix III embodies all the necessities to wrap you in and not let go until the closing credits. The movie is long but the way the story is being told, to attempt to put you in the place of the character, the close-ups and monologues become necessary. I enjoyed the Trilogy, I will own them all on DVD and I will actually watch them over and over.   When a story leaves you wanting more, wanting to know the characters even after the story is over that is the mark of a well made film. Ladies and gentlemen you have my Top 5 of 2003.     Honorable Mention: Finding Nemo;Kill Bill

      I know this may be an absolute shot in the dark but I am curious as to what you, yes you, consider 'good music? What elements of music make it good to you. I say this having read countless posts and news articles about good and bad music. Seeming as though something so abstract and so personal can not have a definitive formula, how can we say or dictate what good music is?   Right now I have in my travel case Jay-Z's the Black Album sitting literally on top of the Nancy Sinatra and Maroon 5. Neither of which complement the other but all of which says a lot about me.  Each record encompasses a different part of my spirit and attitude. Each touches me in a far different way. I love the sketchiness of Nancy Sinatra's Bang Bang. It reminds me of Nina Simone all over again. It's the words and the melodrama of her harmony that entices my earlobes almost bringing me to tears as if I'm a secret I can not let out.   Raw emotion, you have to love it.  I can listen to Jay-Z 'what more can I say' over and over and over because it epitomizes Hip Hop and lyricism. Its all about the attitude and that song embodies it:     And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines And I ain't animated, like say a, Busta Rhymes But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines Add that to the fact I went plat a bunch of times Times that by my influence On pop culture I supposed to be number one on everybody's list We'll see what happens when I no longer exist Fuck this  (What more can I say?)    It's the finest poetry. How you ask? Think of Emily Dickinson writing about poetry in a poem. This exactly what Jay is doing its all the same format just a different frame of mind. Its not so much what he's saying ( although it is) as how he's saying it. Think about being fed up. Think about proving a point to someone so obstinate that you step out of calm self and get down to the bare essentials. I've been there! I've done it! I have been placed in the position where I had to show I was a stepping mat and when I am forced t prove myself it doesn't come out squeaky clean, it comes out raw, so that there are no more misconceptions. Feel me?   Then there's someone like Maroon 5 who has Harder to Breathe and Tangled. And they give you edgy and gritty:    How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable So condescending unnecessarily critical I have the tendency of getting very physical So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle  You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here This Double Vision I was seeing is finally clear You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I'm walking on    Why do I like this? If you haven't noticed by now it's identity. I have been in a position where I have felt exactly like this, so in this case before anything else the lyrics remind me and then the music controls me.   In any case whether its because I identify, exemplify or just feel the beats on some level all three have to be possible in order for me to take a record in and nurture it as apart of my beloved collection.   There are always bigger and more profound questions. Why do you listen to music? Is it too dance? Is it to escape? Is it to enjoy? Art? Creativity? Are listening to melodies or lyrics? Are you passing time or capturing life? Or is all of the above?  I live music, it helps me write, it helps me think, it helps me live. I see every side and each point of view. I feel as though every new song is a new experience and I appreciate that almost like a mini story. I revel being witness to it. I take what I can from each song and move on or stay and stay and stay and stay until I have worn out my welcome or the record whichever comes first. Because I am a music lover, it does become an extension of me. I feel the pings and stabs when people blast Eminem because I identify with him. I understand why he is presented the way he is (because I don't know him I can only assume a presentation). So when they down him they down that part of me that understands him. Maybe for some it's not that serious and for others this is only scratching the surface but I can only dictate what music is to me. What about you?

      I was mildly doing my daily search for interesting posts over at my home  urlLink Blogcritics  when I came across a post I had commented on previously. The post in general is about Eminem's Hate-Rap which most would say is redundant, I say it is cliche. At any rate, the comment below sparked my anti-bullshit radar so let's just skip the preludes and roll camera:   eminem is a commercialised piece of sh*t. if you believe that his lyrics have deep sentimental value then u r blind, fooled by the music industry promotion machine. CONTROVESY = CASH. eminem is ruled by the almighty $. if eminem is as 'real' as he says he is then why the f*ck is he faking popping pills on stage? if he is so 'real' then pop pills 4 real dont promote it cuz its not big and its not clever. mr.mathers sir, to put it nicely, YOU SUCK!   #39 It has always amazed me how success equals selling out. It amazes me when people say 'oh now he got a little money and he's moving out of the hood.' Isn't that the point? If I didn't want to stay there when I was broke why would I want to stay when I am rich? The issue isn't me the rapper changing its the stationary position of the person who is 'hatin'.   We should revel in the fact that controversy equals money when it stops being controversy that means I, as the rapper, have lost my edge and I have started to blend in.   Eminem specifically had trouble with his mother before he had the spotlight. He also was a rampant drug user before stepping into the spotlight as well. Your problems don't change because your records start selling. They increase and become exposed to millions of people instead of immediate family. Your life becomes public property and if you were an asshole in private enter publicity and you have an asshole in public. So how would you chose to handle the pressure? You can lie about it but what's done in the dark most certainly comes to the light. In Eminem's case he chose to exploit his fault instead of denying them. Hell his faults are what fuel his creativity. But people on the outside see money first, so everything becomes a factor of finance.   I am not naive in thinking all entertainers are innocent. But what does it say about the opposing audience that blames everything on money? Money isn't the focus of every artist but if that's all you (the audience) take from them then it's your focus. Get a life!   ******* DISCLAIMER : I have every intention of one day becoming one of these sell-outs haters rant over and I want it properly documented that I was a shallow asshole far before I made my first million.

      I have  been bogged down with the process of being me (not to mention school and work). Currently I am helping my mom work on a project... ok screw that I have more important things in mind. There are two people not in my life that I miss but I am absolutely to hard headed to approach tham about it. Let me clear this up first. 1) I dont have many people in my life for a reason 2) I am tad bit anti social and generally, stupidity and miscommunication  upsets  pisses me off 3)I enjoy solitude and people who understand me and understand that when I care for them my anti social ways take a back seat to quality time with them.   Having cleared that up. I haven't spoken to two friends (and no I do not use the term loosely) in almost two months. The fact that it has been two months for both of them is strictly coincidental. One, the guy, I do not expect to hear from and though I miss him, it is best that we do not ever speak again. Its one of those situations where we crossed boundaries and it did not work out for the best. Therefore the space is necessary in order for us not to be continuous distractions to each others' lives. The fact that he has moved to another state aids our issue tremendously.   The girl, on the other hand, is a different story. I bought her a Christmas gift already. One I can't return.  *****Below is a revealing account of how shallow I can be. If superficiality, stubborness and obsessive compulsive behavior erodes your every nerve than you should stop reading here***********************  Now my problem begins that I have every intention of giving her these gifts. But I physically can not  give them to her. How shoddy would it be for me to mail them or send them thru her bestfriend (an issue we will address later). I do not know what is going on where she is (in life) or what she has gone thru. I remain concerned for her and her well being as well as her family although she would more than likely beg to differ.   ***Sidenote: I am a very objective person that does not mean I do not recognize fault I just dont think fault and judgement go well together. For example, I may think of you as an ass and in most cases I will find a very polite non-threatening way to in fact let you know:  you are an ass .  That does not mean I am judging you in the sense of saying you are an ass and I am not, quite the opposite. Most things I spot in other people only because I have witnessed them first in myself. Hopefully you are keeping up because this rides makes no stops for pick ups, jump on where you can and jump off when you can no longer keep up. Ironically, thats my life as well. ***********  I can only explain my end of the story as I understand it since she will not allow me to understand hers. But I  pissed  hurt her with a post about her religion here on my blog. Reminder:  My Blog  - where I release, almost a diary of sorts. A place where I can come and share these thoughts with myself if noone else. Mind you we have had similar issues with an online diary but I digress. Now what gets me is that she is hella (yes  hella ) passive-aggressive. Meaning instead of actually admitting that what she read hurt her she simply avoided the situation altogether.  You know what I do not feel like kicking a dead horse just understand: there were issues.   At any rate the way things goes is that she gets hyper withdrawn and normally I would take the high road and not let her have it (slanguage: coddle her out of withdrawal). Sidenote 2: Mind you as I type this my mind asks what if she reads this? I take another chance of further  pissing  hurting her and by my continuance of explanation does it imply I do not care? No, but I feel the need to release these feelings, that is the purpose of expression. I safeguarded as much as I could in this friendship I can give no more than you ask for. You asked for nothing. I, on the other hand, asked for plenty: respect, understanding,  urlLink honesty , truthfulness and inclusion to name a few. All these I assumed were a silently stated part of   friendship  .  Which leads me to question why do I invest so much effort in salvaging this friendship? Because I care and that is enough for me. All it takes is caring. I believe (strongly I mightly add) that when you care for someone there is no such thing as abandoning them. On the downside of that it takes an act of congress for me to care. I mean care, not like you, not adore you, not concern myself with you, not think you are nice, not think you are smart, not think you are okay, I mean care for you in the genuine since of family and friendship.  ********* If you have made it this far you deserve a cookie************   What is the point of all this incoherent dribble? I miss my friends both of them. And such is life when the opportunities and instances get in the way of enjoying this existence and sharing it with people you are bonded to, despite the reason you are bonded to them. We only have purpose here when we create purpose so there is no reason to sit dormant and not grab every chance to live and love.   Funny I can see that and yet I still have not made any attempt to rectify my situations which leaves me conflicted, convicted and utterly hypocritical.

      1. Take into account that great love and great achievements involve  great risk.   2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.   3. Follow the three Rs: Respect for self, respect for others and  responsibility for all your actions.   4. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful  stroke of luck.   5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly.    6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.    7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to  correct it.   8. Don't be a fool for old loves, do whatever you need to do to better yourself and kids (if you have any). Remeber it's his/her loss   9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.    10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.    11. Live a good, honorable life.

      I drink water like most people drink soda. I have it with dinner and snacks, like coca cola for some, water just makes my food taste better. I am able to taste the difference between different varieties of H2O like most can decipher between Coke and Pepsi. It's that serious.   Needless to say there was a time when I was blinded by the high of caffeine. I was young and wild (hehe) and distracted by the carbonated effects that made your tongue tingle. Back then I did not realize how much of a sham was going on with the water of the world.  McDonalds 1/1/04  - A double cheeseburger, medium fry and a cup of water $2.14 Taco Bell 12/31/04 - Two soft Tacos Supremes, no lettuce and a cup of water$2.35 Rally's 12/30/04     - Big Buford and a cup of water $2.14 KFC                        - 2 piece all thighs, extra crispy and, you guessed it, a cup of water $3.28  First of all, no I did not go to these Fast Food places every day this week. I just wanted to imply the prices are all current and here is the conspiracy theory: McDonald's and Taco Bell are fine the cups of water were free. Rally's and KFC on the other hand charged you for the water. Now I can understand the cup but why are you charging me for the water. Rally's charges .50 for a cup of water and KFC charges regular drink prices for its water, TAP water to be exact.  Help me understand why this is acceptable practice and who actually buys it?Bottled water I could understand, tap water in a Fast Food cup I can not.   We have been hood winked people, don't fall victim. What is even worse is that some companies (Burger King and Wendy's) even though you get a free cup of water it is literally a cup - more like pour it in my hand I would get more out of it. It's a sad situation that we do not let stand against such practices.   It's just a $1.07 isn't the point? I know there will always be people trying to get over, unfortunately that is to be expected but at some point we have to take notice that we are being exploited. Why does KFC charge you a buck o' seven for a child's cup of water because they can and you let them!      Sidenote* If there are any waiters (servers) out there reading this take notice: NOT EVERYONE WHO ORDERS WATER IS TRYING TO MAKE LEMONADE. Quit putting that thing in my frikkin water man!

      No, I have not seen it yet. I have to work a job (Heaven Help me) and go to class today but I will see this movie before the day is out. What movie? The Passion, of course. I have seen and heard several reviews for this film and most have been, to say the least, quite horrible. Despite the gorey reviews this movie will open in more than 2700 theatres and I can pretty much bet the farm that Mel will make a lot more than the $30 million he spent to produce this film. There truly is no such thing as bad publicity.    Daily News critic Jami Bernard said: “No child should see this movie. Even adults are at risk. Mel Gibson’s ‘The Passion of the Christ’ is the most virulently anti-Semitic movie since the German propaganda films of World War II.”  New York Daily News called it an anti-Semitic work with violence that was ”grotesque, savage and often fetishized” in slow motion.  Bernard called it “sickening” and “brutal” and though she conceded the film was undeniably powerful, she said it “feels like a propaganda tool rather than entertainment for a general audience.” She said “Jews are vilified, in ways both little and big, pretty much nonstop for two hours, seven minutes.”    Seeming as though I am not Jewish, I probably would not understand the sentiment of fear this movie allegedly ensues BUT I have read some/partly/most of the Bible and from my understanding  ~ SPOILER ALERT~  the movie is just like the Book.   C'mon people!! The movie is supposed to be brutal, it's putting you in that place. It's asking you to understand what such a torturous and dreadful event that must have been for The Christ. You are not supposed to see the murder of Jesus and walk away going that was pleasant!! It was murder people!! When has or will murder of any sort EVER be pleasant? I think its redudant for these 'critics' to sit and judge this film as being anti-Semitic, ummm, shall we say thy truth does sting like thy crowneth upon thy dome or thy spikes upon thy hand or thy faithlessness upon thy heart'!!   I'm guessing here but if you read the Bible and you're not already anti-Semitic then peace be still (let it marinate).  ~SPOILER ALERT~  it-is-just-like-the book. I think it is easier for us to create in our minds a picture of Jesus literally as a sacrificial Lamb instead of God in skin. It helps our human brains rationalize torture. We don't think of the Terrorists as being people when we are cutting them up to obtain answers, excuse me I mean delivering them to the butchers to be cut up, but we do want the answers. As long as the means justify the ends we tend to rationalize it as being acceptable. It was ok for Rodney King to get beat to a pulp, he was breaking the law, right? neg-a-tive.   I can not speak for everyone, only myself when I say, I really could care less about the Jews or Christians for that matter. I'm not going to see the movie to get a history lesson (let's not debate the history issue right now people, focus!!). I am going to see the movie in hopes of putting a name with a face. By that I mean, I want to be one of the people who's standing in the crowd who wants to help, who wants to scream this is not right, someone do something, but can't for fear that I will become the next sacrifice. Because isn't that what  it's all about? I'd rather it be you if the alternative is me. I don't want to see what happened then, if it means hurting now. I don't want to understand their plight if it doesn't free me from my own. I want to be the saved not the Savior and I would rather watch such a feat if the alternative is to live it.

      Here Ye! Here Ye! Listen all you lonely depressed sad sack of people who are about to cry because there is no one to buy you a box of chocolates for tomorrow. No one died on February 14th (to make it a holiday), no one sacrificed or gave their life for February to be LOVE DAY. It's a day conspired by said Card Company so people, like yourselves, would piss and moan about noone loving them. And then go out and send flower to themselves, so other people wouldn't think of them as being the sad lonely depressed souls they see themselves as being. Ahhh...Its just another day people. If they only show you they love you on this one day out of the year, you need a helluva lot more than a box of chocolates, ya feel me? Smile cuz you have been processed  But I do like to watch the tears...

      What's the big deal about same-sex marriages. People are entitled to love whoever they feel connected to. If this is truly a country in which church and state are separate (yea right) then let those who love one another marry one another and it be recognized.   No it is not the same as molestation, what it is sinful in the eyes of religious fanatics who don't know how to keep their religion to themselves. I love the Lord, he heard my cry Aiiiiiiiiiiiiyyyyyyyiyhhyyyyyyy......But I digress. I am very spiritual but I do not believe I have the liberty to dictate to another capable adult who they should and should not love for the rest of their lives. Even if it is against what I personally believe. It amazes me that it has taken this long for this to become a hard pressed issue and there is still resistance in today's Janet-tit-popping-Madonna-tongue-tying-Strom-Thurman-child-abusing-Trent-Lott-free-speeching-Queer eye for the straight guy-watching society we live in. Please!  If God can respect your right to free will, who are we not too!!!!  Smile you've just been Dewly processed

      What I realize about myself is that I too an infected. I believe that the person hurting should be the one to walk away from a conflicting relationship. If only emotions were that simple. There is so much going on when you care for someone to just walk away is not ever the answer.   I need to learn this. Although many have tried, most have failed at teaching me. The ones who stayed are some of my closest friends now, we just had to experience growing pains to - get this -  grow . Others seem not to be able to tolerate my solicitous nature and walk away, ironically cause I don't pay them enough attention. Isn't that funny?   I started writing and now I don't want to finish.

      Today I learned a new term. Ironic since it's only six in the morning. I learned the term  cognitive dissonance .     Main Entry:  cognitive dissonance  Function: noun : psychological conflict resulting from incongruous beliefs and attitudes held simultaneously    I didn't know this problem existed until a year ago, maybe less than that. I definitely did not know it had a name, I just thought this person was a sole case. They often choose to be.   Why is it a problem? Let's take homosexuality for example. First, understand I believe who you are attracted too is something you can not control. You can only control what you do about the attraction. Understanding that, imagine the frustration of loving someone and believing, sincerely, that loving that person is wrong.   Our beliefs are the foundations by which we live, love and grow. If those beliefs are strong enough, we began to punish ourselves, thinking its all for the  greater purpose . This begins a spiral towards unease and abashment simply because you are conditioning yourself to discredit your own emotion. You could not ever be in a viable relationship without accepting who you are.  In other words: How can you love someone else if you don't love yourself?  I use Homosexuality as an example because I understand the question it presents in our society in relation to what we  believe .  I also understand there are people out there fighting against themselve because what they feel and what they believe are incongruous and that must be hell to deal with.   It is true that you do learn something everyday and sometimes - you already knew.

      I am known for shopping in the CD store. I can spend hours deliberating on what emotion could possibly exist under that beautifully difficult celophane wrapper. About five years ago while in the used CD section I came across an interesting find: it was an autographed copy of Screaming for my Supper. I didn't know the artist and none of the songs sounded familiar but the fact that it was signed had me sold.   I took it home not expecting much, I figured if someone had an autographed copy and traded it in, it had to be awful, but I played it anyway. The first song started off slow but it moved me. It moved me enough not to miss my 6.00. I appreciated the songs for what they were although the first track is still my fav.  A few years passed and I got Rhapsody service and one of the first artists I looked for was Beth Hart. I noticed she had another album, I figured why not. That's when the love affair began. Her sound was sultry and bluesy and it touched me. Call it cosmic interference but I knew exactly what she meant when she screamed "am I the one?"  She wasn't just singing she was really expecting an answer. I feel like that is what good music is all about. She asks the question we hate to ask for fear of how we will be perceived.  Blame the Moon  It's all the moons fault and her second album  Immortal  explains why.   Of course most artists beyond their time don't get the appreciation they deserve, so just like the first two it was by chance that I happened upon her most recent release  Leave the light on . On this Album Beth sounds like she is straddling the line between who she is and who she knows she should be (spiritually) and the reasons being the two are so hard.    Cause I wanna love  I wanna live  I don't know much about it  I never did,  I don't know what to do, can the damage be undone  I swore to God that I'd never be what I've become  Lucky stars and fairy tales  I'm gonna bathe myself in a wishin' well  Pretty scars from cigarettes  I never will forget, I never will forget  I'm still afraid to be alone  wish that moon would follow me home  I leave the light on  I ain't that bad I'm just messed up  I ain't that sad but I'm sad enough  God bless the child with the dirty face who cuts her luck with a dirty ace  She leaves the light on, I leave that light on      This album offers much more to be admired. She hits the high notes on her third effort and stays true to everything she's done so far. The questions are still there and her spirit is still fresh in every lyric. She is telling the stories we need to hear to remind us, we are not alone.   Music in itself is powerful. Its artists like Beth Hart that make stop, walk to the porch and leave the light on.

      I am in a fiesty mood today. Can anyone tell me who the Democratic candidates are? They all suck. I love being Black but Al and ol' girl (I really dont even care what her name is) will not get my vote by playing the race card. And sad as it is to say, a white woman will be president far before a Black anything.   I was leaning towards Dean (and b leaning I mean standing still and facing in that direction) but then he jumped shipped. These candidates do nothing for me. Nothing!! At least with Al I could attempt to relate him to my boy Slick Willie but there is nothing in the house of Democrat and its a sad situation Dubya gets to do a repeat. SAD.   Why? First of all I am the first to say I am no expert on politics, now politiking is a 'hole 'nother subject, but politics I'm in the gray area. I believe George means well, but I also believe he's slow as a box of rocks and someBODY is running this country sitting shotgun. I'm amazed.   I'm amazed we can spare 80 billion dollars in one year to rebuild and govern a country on the other side of the planet but we can't afford to buy new books for schools. Yes, it is the same thing because in 15 years when those books are no longer relevant there will be a new war created that we will spend that inflated 800 billion on...  Yes, I said created war, and what? We were lead to believe that Saddam was an immediate threat and he needed to be stopped immediately. I'm two fold either that was the biggest horrible lie or the biggest best lie. It was a horrible lie if you moved this country in that direction because you needed to fulfill some testorione charge need to get redemption for 911 and the real culprits were making asses of you. More than usual of course. It was the best biggest lie if you used it as a diversionary tactic to keep all eyes on Saddam while you ripped spit from Osama. Now will we ever know which, oof course, everything done in the dark comes to light, look at Bob Dole, but I digress.   Look I relate everything through my 25 year old eyes and experiences and I have seen and done a lot more than most. The point is I take the time to actually listen and what I am hearing is that Bush will be president again and that depresses me.

      Look who cares!! I don't watch football, but I did see the Halftime show. I mean   the   HALFTIME show. I know that only upscale men with family take the time to watch the gentle nature of football while they enjoy a nice game of Yahtzee! with their family so I could understand why they would be upset about little Billy seeing the teat of the World renowned Ms. Jackson (if you're naaaast-ay). But for the rest of us who actually live on earth and know that's it's football, I'm not buying it.   I believe she wanted the shock value, I don't believe she intended to show the whole ta-ta on t-v. She has an album coming in March, doing a Halftime show that over 100 million people would be watching is more than enough exposure, she got greedy, she wanted to leave in imprint on the mind so when March rolls around she would still be fresh on the brain. She got more than she bargained for and paid the price.   Now here's the clincher: there is no way in Hades new name that you could get me to believe that MTV had no prior knowledge. The only reason the stunt went as far as it did was because the  outfit didn't strip correctly. Meaning it was probably woven or tucked too tightly... Janet's outfit was specially made, was it not? Funding had to be provided and a reason for additional funding had to be given by and to SOMEONE, did it not?   The excuse they are giving is that the little striptease was added after rehearsals (obviously) and it went awry. Aw-ful is more like it but not for ordinary reasons. Mtv expected backlash; what they didn't expect was to be banned from producing another superbowl.    EXEC: Oh hell!! What?? You mean we can't have our name attached to the biggest night in sports ever again? Well this just won't do! Look Janet, I know we coerced you into doing this for the sake of being  "MTv"  but we need you to take the blame. That's the only way Mr. Brown will let us back. You have an album coming out and we'll give you all the free publicity you want, FOR LIFE.  Just do this for us please please please pretty little silver nipple cover upper pleaasseee...

       Joss Stone    Let's cut to the chase, it is reported that this chic is only 16 years old. I say reported because it has to be a damn lie! Listening to this album you forget two things, she's young and she's white. Color and age don't matter hear. You hear the struggle. The struggle to overcome the struggle to be, the struggle to find. It's all wrapped nicely in 10 tracks.   Starting with the ballad "The Chokin Kind". A soulful tale of a lover holding on to hard. Joss is Betty Wright reincarnate. Fittingly, since Betty Wright was in on the "Soul Sessions" among other legends.   Most want to throw her into Neo-Soul or Blues files, buit she deserves to stay straddling the line as she is. She pushing the grain against what we perceive soulful artists to be. And she does not have to push hard. She's ready to live and love and it shows. If she really is only 16 they should have called this album "The Old-Soul Sessions".

      Every week I attempt to sample new music, this week's picks are Joss Stone and Van Hunt.    Van Hunt   I was flipping channels and stopped on this cute guy singing on the Wayne Brady Show, a show I otherwise do not watch. Although I only stopped to stare at the eye candy for a second, I stayed after being pulled in by his mid-70 sound. He took me back to Curtis Mayfield. Admittedly I am not as familiar with the late great CM as I should be, but one thing I or anyone could not miss is his sound. Van Hunt is the rebirth of theat sound.  In "Seconds of Pleasure" he gives you inside track of love. Letting you know it only takes those seconds of treasure to keep you concumed. For some of us we would rather just be "Dust" blown away. Van Hunt has an album full of soulful love songs that are perfect for mellow bass grooving meditation time. Start with track one and you'll stay to track 12.  Along the way experience Lenny Kravitz in his hayday. Curtis Mayfield and even Betty Wright, its all for the expanision of art, its all for the "Highlights".   This cd is a great buy.

      My job provdes us with free therapy and I am on the search. I found my hunt interesting because I already know I want a white woman as my therapist. I have had counseling before and it is a liberating experience. No matter how close you ae to friends and family there is still parts of your life you tend to keep in a personal bank. That does not mean they are secrets but just tidbits of information that you chose to keep to yourself but even the most Narcissitic cynic needs to release. (Ahem!!)  Why a white lady? I'm not sure if this is racist or prejudice but I find white woman to be the most non-threatening and some how when you are telling your deepest emotions to someone you kinda want someone who you can at least look in the eye. I guess being some what of an asshole myself I somewhat believe most Black women to be judgemental (have you read this post?) which would lead me to always wondering how crazy she really thinks me to be. And I don't want a man period. I had issues with daddy and abandonment and I would either become too attached or think of him as an idiot hence my need for therapy in the first place.

      While sitting at my desk Thursday unsuspecting I received an email from a Team Leader in the office. The message read:    Let's all get out and vote. It happens soon. Let's join together and save the sanctity of marriage, please sign the ongoing petition www.nogaymarriage.com    I'm not gay nor do I aspire to marry, which is why I love commenting on the subject. I have no vested interest either way. What I do have is a sincere annoyance for people who choose to impose their traditions on others. What you and I believe marriage to be could be and more than likely is completely different. This is the reason we have terms like 'open marriage' and 'marriage of convenience' because the sanctity of marriage is very superficial universally and can only be substantiated individually. SO why oh why oh why do we run around force feeding our large doses of insecurity on others?  Besides looking at the last 50 years who has desecrated the 'sanctity of marriage' more than HETER-O-SEXUALS?  Sexy Chocolate!!!

      I'm staring out of the bay window of my apartment wondering about the human experience. For three days I have craved nothing more than getting out of this apartment and doing something constructive, yet I have spent the entire time inside.   Why do we go against what is best for us? I know tomorrow when I'm back at work I will hate having not used my time more wisely. I'm looking at a list of things I need to do right now including a story I need to finish and yet I am not doing those things.   I have had the desire to write in this blog for months and though I could come up with anything to write about I used the excuse that I had no time. Like now I am using the blog as a way to ignore the list sitting in front of me.   I guess it's a cycle of procrastination that catches up with us. As the backlog grows longer we begin to shorten it in an effort to avoid it all together. Amazing. I have a wonderful article about Gastro By-Pass Surgery that I will be posting. Not right now though, maybe later.

       In approximately 2hours and 15 minutes my Monday morning work day will be decided. BellSouth currently in talks with Communications Workers of America is reluctant in spending another 1 billion dollars per year for the next three years.  Talks between the union and BellSouth have been slow because of job security and health care.  BellSouth wants employees to pay a monthly premium for their insurance and in term they will increase salaries by one percent.  Job security BellSouth says is up to the BellSouth customers, that position I actually agree with. At last reporting BellSouth had changed its last proposal. Employees were instructed on Friday to make everything all nice and comfy for the managers coming in having to do the peons work.  Techs leave your trucks gassed up, reps check your voicemails, leave our badges don't give us any greif you little ingrates.  Will I strike? I will. If for no other reason than I need a mini - legal -vacation. I can take a lot but being that my main job is to create revenue for the company so the manager hierchy can live far more comfortable than I am presently, I feel they have no room for complaining. Maybe after a few hours of doing the job (again, in some cases) they will see or remember that.  Realistically I feel with Time Warner's new digital phone service being released and BellSOuth going into Satellite tv they can not afford the bad press. It won't look good that the big bad company won't keep paying for health benefits for it's employees. So all odds point to me having to go to work monday, dammit.
