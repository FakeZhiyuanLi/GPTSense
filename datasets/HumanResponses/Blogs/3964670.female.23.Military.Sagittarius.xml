      I am the luckiest girl in the world. It’s 11:30 at night, and all I can think about besides my intense desire for sleep, is that in less than 48 hours, I won’t have to sleep alone. My guy is coming out to see me.  I say “my guy” because there is no better term to use. I’ve tried the “boyfriend” term, but I hate that. It sounds so high school. Junior high school even. (Although I don’t mind him using the word girlfriend. In fact, he better be using the word girlfriend a whole lot.) And all the other words sound wrong too. “Significant Other” sounds either snobby or gay. “Other Half” implies that I’m only half a person on my own. My friend Kris calls her live-in boyfriend her “split-apart” because they use it in some movie. But as of yet, I haven’t found a term I like. So I use boyfriend and cringe or, I say “my guy.”  Well, no matter what I call him, he’s coming to see me and I’m so excited. I think that this is quite possibly the most romantic gesture any man has ever shown me. I was just out in NJ. In fact, I went out there to see him “one last time” before I went to basic. He really didn’t need to come out. But he is. I am so incredibly flattered. And amazed. No man has ever done anything like that for me. And I’m not entirely certain I deserve it. But I’m just going to enjoy every minute we get to spend with each other.

      Justin cheated on me both physically and emotionally. I woke up nights, and he’d be at my computer talking to some strange girl. He’d tell them he loved them. Then he’d come to bed and tell me the same thing. It made me feel cheap, or at least easily replaceable. A dime a dozen.  I let it go on though. I tricked myself into believing that he was all I deserved. All I’d ever get. And I loved him. So I stayed. When Justin and I broke up, we decided to still live together. We still slept together, only now it was ok for him to sleep with other girls. I didn’t date, I didn’t want to.  One night I fell asleep waiting for Justin to come home. When I woke up the lights were on downstairs, and I could hear talking in the front room. There was a girl’s voice. He had picked up some girl in the Albertson’s parking lot. When I walked downstairs, she was on top of him. I was so angry that I called a friend and had him pick me up. That night he slept with that strange girl in our bed.  I lived with my friend Joe for about a week, then Justin and I made up and I moved back. What I mean by made up is that he told me he loved me. And I desperately wanted to be loved, so I went back to him.  I guess that’s a big part of my problem. I’ve never felt really loved. I guess by men anyway. I hate to blame it on my dad, that’s so cliché, but it might be true. Ever since I was 8 years old, I’ve wondered why I wasn’t good enough. Maybe my relationships are an extension of that.  I attract men who will treat me badly, and those who won’t, I push away by believing that they will.  Maybe that’s the problem with my guy. I don’t think he’d purposefully hurt me. But my distrust makes everything he does suspect. And there’s only so much of that one can take before they run out and cheat. It’s like, how far can you push someone before they finally walk away. That’s my goal in relationships I think. Subconsciously anyway.

      Once you fall completely in love, it's difficult to remember your life before it. Not only that, but I really don't have much of a desire to think about life before Eric. I want to focus on the future. On our future.  But it brings up a question. What do I do with so many years worth of pictures and memorabillia that have someone else in them? The easy answer would be just to get rid of them. But then it would be like I didn't exist for those years. Is it ok to keep those things? I'm allowed to keep memory boxes and scrap books? It's not like I want to look back at them and remember my old loves. But I do want to remember what I've done with my life. Where I've been. And sometimes other men just happened to be with me.  At the same time, I don't want to hurt Eric's feelings. He'd never tell me to throw them away though. He's not like that. I wonder if he'd be straight up with me if I asked him. Just "Eric, do you mind if I keep all my old photos?" But that might sound like I want them. I don't know.

      I'm not quite sure who I'm writing these entries for. I don't think I'm going to tell Eric I have this diary. I think I just need to tell my stories. Get thoughts out of my head, off my chest.  I re-read the entry in his diary about what his ex said. I shouldn't. It kills me to think about him sleeping with anyone else. Especially someone who would purposefully hurt him and therefore definitely didn't deserve him.  But when I think about it, I wonder how many of the girls he's been with have been better than me. Skinnier than me. I'm way to self-conscious for my own good. Eric is sweet and tells me that I'm amazing, but it's hard to believe sometimes. Mostly just because I have such a low opinion of myself.  I pretend like I don't. I tell everyone how much I think of myself. Tell them that I think I'm special. That I'm an elitist. But in the end, I'm really just afraid that I don't measure up.  And so I wonder about this girl he slept with. I wonder what she looks like. I wonder if she was better than me, less inhibited. I wonder if he liked her more. I mean, just in the sexual sense. Because I know he loves me. And he didn't love her.  I wonder how many girls he has said I love you to. How many times he's meant it. Lots of guys say things they don't mean. I wonder if he has too. I know he means it when he says it to me though. I can see it in his eyes. I can tell by the things he does. You can't fake that.  I wonder if Eric thinks about the number of guys I've been with. The number never bothered me before, and now I worry that it's too high. There are definitely a few I wish I could take off the list. 4 out of 7 actually. That makes me feel bad about myself though. That I regret the majority of the men I've slept with. At least they aren't the ones I slept with more than twice. I made mistakes, but not for long. Not that anyone would know that just by hearing a number. It's not really an acurate description of my sex life. But I don't think Eric wants all the details anyway.  At times I think I want all the details of his though. I wish I knew more about his past. Then I remember how jealous I get just reading about the ex who didn't think he was any good.  Which by the way was just a horrible malicious thing to say.  Eric also says really sweet things. Not those silly things that nobody means. He doesn't make promises either. But he talks about a future with me. He tells me I'm beautiful. Basically everything that a girl would want to hear. Sometimes it makes me wonder how much experience he has saying those things though. It really doesn't matter though. He's saying them to me now. And as long as I have any say in it, he'll only say them to me for the rest of our lives.  Being away from each other, sometimes I worry about him being faithful. I mean, I know he must get lonely. And I know that he's really cute. A fact that does not go unnoticed by girls at the bars he hangs out at. It would be extremely easy for him to be unfaithful. And he wouldn't get caught either. I have no way of knowing what goes on with him when I'm not around. I just have to trust him.  Trust is a scary word for me. But I'm working on it. I desparately want to trust Eric. I don't want to worry about what he does while we're apart. And for the most part, I don't. Just when I start feeling bad about myself do I think about it. When I start to doubt my ability to keep a man. I've not been able to do it in the past. Have I gained the ability now? Or have I met a man with an interest in being faithful? The last man was obviously not interested in that.

      Really interesting in a Frankenstein sort of way. That's what my neck looks like right now. Yesterday morning I underwent a thyroid lobectomy. Meaning, they removed the right side of the gland that regulates your hormones.  Eric met me at the hospital at 6:30. They let him stay with me up until they took me to the surgery room. I was so grateful for that. As tough as I wanted to be, I've never been through surgery before and it scared me. Just having him there made me feel better. He does this thing where he'll touch my cheek and tuck my hair behind my ear. It's one of the sweetest most reassuring guestures in the world. I don't know if he knows that.  When they wheeled me away on the gurney, I just kept looking back. I wasn't ready to leave Eric yet. But the corpseman who sat with me until surgery was really nice. She talked about her husband and her time in the navy so far. She said I was luck to have a guy who'd come all the way from New Jersey just to be with me during surgery. I agreed. But for all her niceness, she wasn't exactly the most able corpseman. She blew the biggest vein in my right hand. That means she poked straight through it while trying to set up my IV. Apparently I have small veins. She found a decent sized one in my left wrist though.  They also hooked me up to some weird leg things. I think they called them DCP's although I have no idea what that stands for. They were kind of like blood pressure cuffs that went around my calves and inflated every minute. It was to keep the blood circulating in my legs because I wouldn't be moving them for a while.  They gave me the drugs to put me out before I even got into the surgery room so I don't remember it at all. The drugs take 30 seconds to knock you out.  When I got back upstairs I remember the nurse telling me she was going to go look for Eric. When I opened my eyes again he was there. Over the next several hours I drifted in and out of sleep and Eric was always right there. One time he was kneeling at the side of my bed holding my hand and we both fell asleep. The corpseman woke us up when she came in to check my vital signs.  I kept expecting them to kick Eric out, especially as the night wore on and it was getting later and later. But nobody seemed to mind him being there. In fact, the night corpseman told him he could sleep on the extra bed or climb into bed with me. I think he was afraid to sleep with me though. I was a giant tangle of tubes.  There was the IV, but I also had to have a drain coming out of my neck. It ran the entire length of the incision under the skin. Then, it came out and led to a little ball that collected the blood. That was attached to a suction tube that emptied into a bucket. Eric took a couple pictures of it for Lainie. I figured she'd like to see it. In fact, I may like to see it later too.  So, Eric stayed with me the whole night. It was nice to have him there. Just to know that I wasn't alone. To know I didn't have to be afraid. I was amazed at how well he dealt with it. I don't think I would have handled him being broken as well as he did me. It's still fairly early in our relationship to have to deal with things like this.  I kept apologizing for being so ugly. But he was sweet. Told me I was beautiful. He'd kiss my forehead and tuck my hair behind my ears. Run his fingers across my cheek. He sat on the edge of the bed for a while, rubbing my legs.  I got to thinking about it, and this was very real. I mean, life isn't always going to be about the pretty stuff. And if we can do this now, we won't be afraid of it later right? He's going to have to see me looking a mess eventually.  Anyway, this morning the Dr. came to remove the drainage tube. I was nervous and grabbed ahold of the bed rail. Eric pryed my hand off it and held it. Commander Ulnick had to cut two of the stitches that held the drain in place and then pull it out. That was when we realized just how long that thing was. About 4 inches. It hurt like crazy. But now that it's out I feel a lot better. I have more movement as well.  I had to say goodbye to Eric at the hospital. That's the hardest thing to do, say goodbye to him all the time. I can't wait until we don't have to do that any more. He had his arm around me till the duty driver came to pick me up, then he kissed me when we thought no one was looking. You take for granted simple things like getting to kiss your boyfriend until someone tells you you aren't allowed to do it in public any more.  The people here at THU (temporary holding unit) get to decide whether or not I can take convalescence leave. If I do, I'm going to go out and see Eric in Jersey. Even if it means I'll have to say goodbye again. I just want more time with him. Always. I guess I'm greedy like that. It's not ever enough.  I told Eric that I'm glad he thinks scars are sexy, because I'm going to have a decent sized one now. I don't think he knew he thought scars were sexy until I told him that. But honestly, I don't think he'll care. He doesn't seem to see all the things that are wrong with me. Even though I do my best to point out all my flaws. He just keeps loving me. Maybe one of these days we'll figure out a way to be in the same state for more than a week at a time...

      Eric made a list a while ago about all the qualities he wanted in a woman. I guess I never bothered to do the same because I figured Eric was all those things. But in the spirit of being fair to myself, I'm going to do it just to be sure.  I need someone who's ambitious. Maybe growing up in Utah affected me too much, but I still believe the man ought to go out and earn a living. He doesn't necessarily have to make more than me, but he needs to contribute. He needs to prove that he's committed to making our future work. (Check)  I need someone who thinks I'm funny. My little sister always says that she'll marry when she meets a man who thinks she's as funny as she thinks she is. I really think that's true. I love my jokes. The man I want to be with ought to love them too. Not just laugh courteously. I want him to get me. And be able to banter with me. (Check)  I need someone caring and emotionally available. Sometimes I have a hard time remembering I'm loved. And I need someone to remind me. I need a guy who is willing to do that. A guy who's not above holding me when I cry. Kissing my tears away. A man who is willing to listen to my complaints and then talk about which of them are justified. Not just about him. About life too. Sometimes I can be irrational. I need a little sanity in my life. Someone to ground me. (Check)  As shallow as this is going to sound, I need someone attractive. Someone I find physically appealling. I know that looks aren't everything, but, I need to not be embarassed of the person I'm with. Also, I love that thrill of being with a good looking guy. (Check)  I also like a little jealousy. A guy who is interested in who I'm with. Someone who shows he doesn't want to lose me. But there is too much of a good thing. I need a guy who will trust me too. (Check, I think.)  I think that's all I'm writing for now. I'll get back to you with more later.

      Follicular carcinoma. That's what I have. It means that I'll be at THU for a lot longer. Months in fact. I can't handle this. I just want to cry. I want to lay on the floor in the middle of the quarterdeck and scream and kick my legs. I want to flail my arms hitting anything and anyone within distance. I want to run through the halls tearing shit off the walls. Wailing, snot nosed bawling. I hate this. I don't want cancer. Why didn't someone ask me?

      I have been awful about writing entries ever since I got home from basic training. I think it's because I don't spend much time online any more, and what I do gets devoted to Eric emails. Or chatting with him, Timmy, or Randy.  I also call Eric every night before I go to bed. It's the closest I can get to sleeping with him these days.

      I have become a bitch. Not that I never was before, but the last few days have taken me to knew heights of bitchy-ness. Whereas before, I might tell someone to back off. Now I tell them to back off a cliff and may death come slowly.  It all started when my Dr. decided to take me off my thyroid medication. Yes, I know exactly how bad that sounds "I'm feeling a little crazy because I've stopped taking my meds." But it's true. In order for them to do radiation, my hormone levels have to go unregulated. This is quite possibly the worst experience of my life. I'll be fine, walking down the hall, enjoying my day and all of the sudden I morph into Super Bitch (but without the spiffy costume). What I wouldn't give for a phone booth and a costume change, because then at least people would see it coming. Instead, they are just innocent bystanders trapped by my evil alter-ego. I eat them up, spit them out, and step on the remains as I walk down the hall.  Worst part about it, after I'm done I feel this incredible sense of remorse. But there's no way to make up for the way I've treated people. There's no reason, no excuse, no warning. Not even for me.  It makes me cry too. I cry because I'm stuck inside myself. Watching myself behave badly and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. I feel like the hulk "You wouldn't like me when I get angry..."  I also cry about Eric. Logical, reasonable, sensible Twighla understands that Eric has a bar exam to study for. But SB Twighla doesn't care. She wants all his attention all the time. Poor Eric can't provide that, and so I fear I'm making him feel like an inadequate boyfriend. But it doesn't actually have anything to do with him. I wish I could convey that to him. But I can't. I can't even keep my mind on the same topic for more than 5 minutes.  Petty Officer Hoffman told me the other day that just watching me try to concentrate was enough to give him a headache. It's not my fault though. I have absolutely no control. Do you know what it's like to have no control over your own functions.  I no longer have military bearing. I've had to stop standing watches for fear I'll say something I don't mean. Something I'll regret, or more likely, something someone will make me regret. I've worked so hard to get this far. I don't want to fuck it up by being unmedicated.  That applies to Eric too. I'm afraid this will scare him off. Here we are, so newly engaged. And I'm not the girl he loves any more. I will be again, but, who knows when. Before I take leave I'm going to have them test my blood, see if I'm ready to be radiated. But if not, I have no idea when it will come. Soon. Dear God let it be soon. I don't know how long I can contain the Super Bitch.

      My flight got in at 6 am at JFK. Eric drove the 2 hours to pick me up. We ran out of gas on the way back to Jersey. Suprisingly enough, that's the first time I guy ever did that to me. While waiting for the gas guy to come help us out, we fell asleep. Me with my head on his chest and his arms around me. It was so sweet, so pure. That's one of the things I love so much about us. The simple little things. They bring me amazing amounts of joy. That's not even a word I ever used to use.  When we got back to Jersey we took a nap. We were both exhausted from lack of sleep and the early morning. Plus, the invitation of any time in Eric's arms is too good to resist.  We layed around and just generally acted lazy all day. Until about 8 pm. Then Eric gets this funny idea that he wants to show me the Atlantic Ocean. I protested, saying it would be dark before we got there. But we left anyway. The drive was great. I just love being with him. It's the simple things I miss so much when we are apart ya know?  Anyway, we got to the beach and we walked around for a long time. The misquitoes were insane. We were almost eaten alive. I had to wear my sweatshirt just to cover my arms. And my legs were covered in bites from where I'd rolled up my pant legs.  We were using the tiny flashlight on Eric's keys to look at things. Jelly fish that glowed as they lay stranded on the beach. Little side-crawling crabs. And the most interesting, horseshoe crabs. Those were almost scary looking.  After walking for quite a while, we turned about and came back. I watched our footsteps.. enjoying how they never got far enough apart for us to have to unlink hands. I didn't let go of him on the way back either. It seems like I never get enough hand holding time. I make up for it whenever we are together.  We got back to the car and sat outside, watching the ocean. It was amazing. The boats going back and forth. The oil rigs off in the distance. And there was lightening very far off to the right side. It was beautiful. I didn't want for things to end but the misquitoes were killing me. I suggested maybe we could sit in the car, but Eric wanted to stay out for a little longer.  He went to the car and turned on his stereo though. It was "That's All" by Rod Stewart. He walked over to where I was sitting on a log and he sat beside me. He sang the whole song to me. It was so sweet. I tried to kiss him in the middle of it, but he moved away. That's when I realized something was up.  I don't remember if he got on one knee or not. I was crying too hard to see. In fact, I didn't really see the ring until after it was on my finger. It took a few seconds for me to collect myself enough to speak. It must have seemed an eternity to Eric.  But I said yes. Through tears and a snotty nose I said yes. He even kissed me that way. I am the happiest girl in the world. And now I'm going to be a happy married girl!

      I'm drowning. Bobbing hopelessly through my days here at THU. There's no one to help you here, no one to link arms with and keep you afloat. No companionship. Only sharks. Funny thing about sharks, if you lay quietly, succombing to the waves, they leave you alone. Only when you kick your legs and swim for shore, for salvation, do they attack. They don't want you to get away, because they never will. The more you paddle to safety, the harder they bite at you. Drag you down. Kill your spirit. Once they've tasted blood they don't stop. They know where your weakness lies and so they attack that point at every opportunity. They survive off the pain and misery of others.  If you do happen upon someone else in the water, it's best to stay away. Their thrashing for safety only knocks water in your face. And you choke, because you can barely keep your own head above the water.  But I will survive. That's all you can call this existance. I move through my day cautiously. Not causing waves, trying not to be noticed. I fear sharks. But I'll make it out of the water and into the arms of my love. His love makes me strong enough to float home.

      I'm sorry that I'm awful about updating this. I'm really going to try harder from now on. As it is, I got to work early this morning for our regular Thursday quarters. But apparently it was cancelled today without advanced notice. So I drug my butt out of bed early for no reason. Not that I'm bitter or anything though. And we are doing our regular muster early. So I have just enough time to not write a decent entry. But I thought I'd write anyway.  Hopefully more to follow.

      Some days I'm just really tired. Today is one of those. It's not that I didn't get enough sleep last night. It's not that I woke up earlier than normal. I just feel like there is a tremendous weight on me. Like there's nothing I can do to wiggle my way out from underneath it. Maybe I need another bubble bath.

      Better late than never right? In that spirit, I'm going to jot down some of my New Year's Resolutions. Now, in the past, I've never been one to keep resolutions, and so far this year hasn't proven much different. But if I give up hope on myself then I'm really lost aren't I?   #1 I want to stop drinking so much carbonation. With that, I want to start drinking more water. I was thinking about it, and over my Christmas holiday, I didn't drink a single glass of water. Sure, I had some if it was mixed in with hot cocoa and Diet Coke is like 99% water anyway. But if we are just talking pure water, the most I had was what you accidentally swallow in the shower or while brushing your teeth. That's pretty pathetic.   #2 I want to be less of a procrastinator. Yeah I know, funny coming from the girl who is writing her resolutions 11 days late, but I never said I was perfect. I don't want to put my homework off until the morning. And I don't want to start a new week with a mountain of laundry and an empty fridge. I want to keep on top of things.   #3 I want to be a better sister. I've had some pretty bad shake ups in my family lately and it's come to my attention that there are people who needed me and I was unavailable. I don't ever want them to feel that way again. I want them to be able to count on me. I want my friends to feel that way too. That no matter what, they can talk to me. I may not always have the right answers. Hell, half the time I can't understand the questions. But that doesn't mean I love you less. And I want to be a person who proves it.   #4 I want to see more of this area. I wake up in the morning in one of the most beautiful places in the world and sometimes I forget and take it for granted. I don't want to stop being in awe of Monterey. I don't want to leave in March of 2005 and wonder what I did with all my time. I want to see Yosemite, camp at Big Sur, roast marshmellows on the beach, and learn to scuba dive. I want to make more of my weekends.   #5 You knew this had to be on there somewhere right? I want to get in better shape. When I left Provo, after vacation, I was getting winded just running up the stairs. I don't want to do that. In fact, I want to be able to run, really run. Not this walk-jog-walk shit I do now. By July I want to do at least 2 miles without stopping. May sound easy for some of you, but I've been lazy for a long time.   Well, that sounds good enough for now. Hopefully I'll write in a while with my progress.   179 Days till the Big One

      Another Thursday, another cancelled quarters. Have I mentioned how bad I hate it when this happens.  I've only got one hour of class this morning, then I have a dentist appointment. Fun eh? After that, I'm sure I'll be fun in class. Arabic is difficult to speak when you have full functioning ability of your mouth muscles. I don't know how well I'm going to be able to deal.  The amusing thing is, they tried to schedule my dentist appointment for 2 hours before my speaking test. They were certain I'd be done in plenty of time. I guess they didn't think I'd need to use my mouth.

      I want everything! This shouldnt' surprise those of you who know me very well. I feel like I have to be everything and everyone and at least ten steps ahead all the time.  But at the same time, I wish I had down time with E. Just the 2 of us, some activity we shared. But it seems like half our days are spent without even seeing each other (actually, it's only Tuesday and Thursday). And other obligations seem to leak in on my other days.  And on the rare occasion it's not my fault, his job decides to send him up to SF for a weekend. How unfair is that?  I know it's all my fault, but does that automatically null my right to bitch about it? Oh wait, it does? Damn!

      Things are just returning to normal after my sister's visit last week. I was trying to make sure everything we did was fun, I didn't get around to doing all the necessary stuff. Which meant a lot of work for me Sunday after she left and yesterday. But it was way worth it. We had a great time! I can't wait till she gets to come out again.  I was thinking yesterday about all the obligations I put on myself. Eric told me that I'm not allowed to start a new BIG project for the next couple of months. I can see where he's coming from. I think he's afraid I'll forget his name.  For starters, school is a huge obligation. Especially considering I'm now expected to keep this performance level. I currently have a 3.83 GPA. God I hope I can keep it. There are a million and five people lining up to take top honors in my class (ok, ok, maybe only 27). It's very competitive.  That competitiveness applies to collateral duties also. Because everyone here does so much and are such standout sailors, it takes a lot of work to be better than.  So, I started tutoring. He is a guy in my same class, so that's a little tough on me. But it's working out ok. We are required to put in 3 hours a week, but we have been averaging 6. I see his performance in class as a direct reflection on me, so it's very stressful.  On top of that, I'm my division co-representative for MWR (Morale, Welfare, and Recreation). Which just means I got to meetings just about every Wednesday during lunch to help plan activities and fund raisers. That's all well and good but I really just want to help plan the Navy Day Ball. All in good time I guess.  My latest venture is with Partnerships in Education. My detachment just adopted an elementary school and we will be tutoring down there after school. I have started doing that yet, but as soon as I get a chance, it's going to take up another big chunk of my time.  All this goes on top of my mandatory work out schedule with my division. And all other military duties they make think to throw on. So yeah, I'm a little busy. I can understand why Eric doesn't want me adopting my very own highway or anything like that.

      I really hate those pigs...  You know, the ones from the story. The moral is supposed to be if you work hard and build your house carefully, and sturdily (I'm not even sure if that's a word) that not even the big bad wolf can touch you. We all read that as children right? But what they don't put at the end of the book is the appropriate disclaimer. It should read, "now remember children, pigs can't really build houses, and you should never listen to a thing they say because they are lying dirty pigs."  Truth is, our lives are nothing more than a house of cards. And it doesn't matter how carefully you build it. How elaborate your plans are, or what kind of structure you give it. You are powerless to protect it. Any wolf can come along and the smallest whisper of breath can send your whole world crashing down around you.  And the worst part is, wolves don't care. You can beg and plead for them to leave your little house alone. What interest do they have in your hopes and dreams? They are of no consequence to wolves, but mean everything to you. Problem is, wolves live to crumble card houses. That's the entire reason for their existance.  So I stand here, desperatly clinging to the walls of my little card house, praying to God that the wolves just pass by this time. I'm sick of rebuilding, I just want to be left alone.

      First things first, I'm sick so back off ok people? I told you I don't post. You didn't believe me though. And now you are going to try to change me. Am I marrying all of you or what?  Anyway, so today, I'm on the quest to find out if the ceiling in my classroom contains asbestos. Because Monday a ceiling tile fell onto my chair. Luckily I wasn't in it at the time, but it did spread a decent amount of dust, insulation-y stuff, and tile hunks all over my part of the classroom. And today, little dust particles kept falling on me. Even to the point where I could feel them in my lungs when I breathed. That's when the sick thought accord to me that the military hates paying to have buildings updated.  Does asbestos really cause cancer? If it does, I'm not too worried. Cancer is like lightening right? Never strikes twice. Let's hope so.  Anyway, THERE, are you happy now? Will you leave me in peace. Back to my bed where I belong, with a glass of Crystal Lite, a large box of tissues, and enough Ny-Quil to drown a horse!

      As operation Beautify&nbsp;Me has yet to see much real progress, I've enlisted the help of a friend, an army kid from my class. He's drawing up an exercise and diet plan for me as we speak. I've only got 8 weeks left, but he said that should be plenty of time. And I can do anything for just 8 weeks right? The key to his whole plan for me is eggs. But just the white parts. I've never been much of an egg person, but I'll see where this ends up.  And on the subject of my diswhitening, I've not had much success there either. A couple days ago I had a little time after school and it was a hot day. So I decided to hit the beach for a while in my new bikini top and shorts. I was just out there minding my own business, reading a book, not bothering any one, when I hear some guys next to me talking and one says "Yeah, she'd be pretty cute if she weren't so damn white."  Now, I never asked for his astute assessment of my personal characteristics. Why did he feel the need to give it? Shouldn't he have waited until I was at least out of ear shot before saying something like that? I figured the answer was yes, so I got up, pakced up my things and then went to have a talking with him.  After asking if he was talking about me, to which he replied "yes" after much stammering and embarassment, I told him that some of us have real jobs, which require us to be in offices all day long. Therefore we don't get the sun that one would, say, on a roof. And then I left. I think he got the point.

      We have a Geography test coming up in class on Wednesday. We have to know all the countries, capitals, bodies of water and flags of all the countries in the Arab World. And we have to be able to spell them in English and Arabic.  This leads to a bit of trouble. Especially when you consider that Palestine is a country by the Arab World standards. But they don't have a capital. Or at least they aren't supposed to since they aren't actually a country. And what type of govt do they have? Oh that's right, they don't. Same goes for Iraq. What is their govt type just yet? Libya is listed as a Republic, but I guess that's only because there wasn't a box to check for "Military Dictatorship."  And the Comoros Islands and Eritrea. Bet you didn't even know they were countries. I didn't until a couple weeks ago. It's like trying to memorize all the "stans" during the fall of the Soviet Union.  And here's another thing I got to thinking about, the new Iraqi flag (if you haven't heard about this yet or seen it... http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1095484.htm  So yeah, OUR govt created this flag. Does anyone else see a problem with that? No one in my class seemed to. But I think, my God, not only are we not allowing them to have any say in the way we are setting up their new govt, but we are also replacing all their symbols.  I understand the old one and the bad memories, since Saddam added to it. But at least it looked like the other flags in the region. The Green symbolizes Islam. Do you seen any green on the new flag? In fact, the closest Middle Easter flag that the Iraq one resembles is, Israel. Now why would that be, oh perhaps because we created them too.  I just have sore feelings about the way this thing is going. I think that the Iraqi people deserve more of a say then what they are getting. Not the crazy weapons toting people, but the ones who actually give a damn. They should be able to help set up the govt, to pick their flag, and to try Saddam Hussein.  So in closing, give 'em back the damn flag, Allah is great, and back off Hague!

      One who begets, gives birth to, or nurtures and raises a child; a father or mother  To act as a parent to; raise and nurture: “A genitor who does not parent the child is not its parent” (Ashley Montagu).   These are 2 of the many definitions listed by Dictionary.com for the word "parent." This is something I've done a lot of thinking about over the past few weeks. I always thought certain words were just concrete. There was no room for personal interpretation in their meanings, but I guess I was wrong with this one. Maybe I've always had a concrete definition of the word parent, because I always had a concrete parent.  My mother is one of the most concrete people I've ever met. By this, I don't mean that she is strict, rigid, unforgiving, or most of the other things that come to mind when you think of concrete. Just that she is always there, that she's stable.  On that other hand, I've never thought of a parent as something so evaporative, so volatile, until I met one of the first loves of my life, my little nephew. His family life, was just that. He spent the first 5 years of his life being passed from one incompetent home to the next, until my mother, the most stable substance on earth, stepped in. She never promised to make life perfect for him or to give him everything. But she promised he'd be loved. And that for as long as he wanted, he'd have a home.  If you've never had these things, this is an amazing gift. And through my nephew I was able to realize just how great these gifts were. Things I'd always taken for granted. A mother who put her kids first, even at the expense of her own social and love life. A mother who I never had to worry about. A mother who was a mother, so I could be a kid.  Recently, two more children came to my mother, in need of help. They are my nephew's brother and sister. Although they are no blood relation, the fact that they needed a wall, something concrete and stable in their lives, was enough to make the decision for my mom. Of course she'd take them in, because that's what she does.  This is where things get a little tricky. The mother of all these kids. The woman who gave them up years ago, to fall in and out of bad relationships, use drugs, and basically try her damndest to end her life, is back. And she thinks she's entitled to her children. Laws where they live heavily favor biological mothers. They say it's in the best interest of a child to be with their parent. But what if the mother never was a parent. What if she never took care of her own children. not to say that the couple weeks my mother has had them, equals parental status, but I think she should have every bit as much say in what happens to these children as the birth mother.  If not more, because she's got something going for her, that no one else in these children's lives has. She has never given them away. She's been the only one to honor her promise to love them and give them a home. Not just any home either. One in which they'll never have to watch their loved physically abuse or be abused by a spouse, boyfriend, whatever. One in which there will always be enough food to eat, even if it's not always their favorite kind and even if they are expected to eat vegetables. And they will never have to come home to find a drunk or drugged mother. Let's just hope that the police, DFS and everyone else involved will realize the advantages these kids will have being raised with someone who loves them.

      So this whole Shroud of Tourin thing has got me thinking. For starters, I'm amazed by how religious people can completely shun all scientific fact, just because they feel it is another way. The shroud has been carbon dated, it could not possibly have been used to wrap Jesus in. But people don't care. They want so badly to believe in something that they are willing to give up all logical thought. I think they should all start to believe that pigs can fly. Might be more entertaining for me.  Then I started wondering about this shroud. Apparently there is a face mark left on it. Was Christ radioactive? How do you leave an imprint on something that lasts 2000 years? Even permanent marker wears off before that. And they call it permanent for a reason.  Lastly, I got to thinking about the reprecutions of this turned out to really be the shroud used to wrap Jesus' body after his crucifixion. There would be blood on it right? Now I haven't seen the shroud, but I would imagine there is some on there. And since it's been in the hands of hundreds of scientists, who would know if they just happened to knock a little of the blood off into a sterile container. Now they've got the DNA of Christ. Now, it might not be completely, but you can fix that by mixing in the missing portions with frog DNA right? We could clone Jesus! The only set backs I can see to this is that speeches would be difficult to deliver, seeing as he'd have to stop to clear the frogs in his throat. And also, frogs don't care about loaves of bread and fish. They much prefer flies. And it would be really easy to feed a large group if all you were serving was flies. Also, can you imagine a drunken half frog half Jesus after he drank that water he turned into wine. that tongue would be everywhere. Not really becoming of the son of God right?  And what would you do with a frog-Jesus run amuck once you created him? It's not like you could crucify him again. (Not unless you cloned a village full of Frog-Jews. Or let Israelis and The French mate.) So you'd probably just have to separate him from decent society right? Hence his own island. Where he can live happily on his own performing all the miracles a frog-Jesus would want to perform. And I plan on making the movie about it. Jurassic Jesus.

      Well, Matt has inspired me. And so Operation Beautify&nbsp;Me starts next week. See, there's nothing like standing in front of 3 way mirrors for 2 hours to make you realize all your imperfections. That is exactly what I did this Saturday during my dress alteration appointment. Good news is, they only have to do a hem (because I'm short) and a bustle (because I don't want my dress dragging in the grass all day). Bad news is, my lats need a lot of work. Apparently hours of pushups, situps, and running up long flights of stairs doesn't do much for those. That's about all our divisional PT ever does. So, it looks like I'm going to have to start doing a little more gym work on my own.  Also, because of an unfortunate sunburn incident last weekend, I've got to try and get rid of these nasty lines. I know everything you guys are probably thinking about tanning beds being evil and giving you cancer, but I've heard rumors that cancer is like lightening and that it only strikes the same place once, so I should be safe. And there's is a tanning salon right next to my house, unfortuantely, I don't know if their hours are going to fit with my crazy busy schedule.  And lastly, due to an extreme caffiene addiction, I am going to start bleaching my teeth. They really really need it. But I'm not going to cut back on my Dt Coke, some days I'm certain that is all that is keeping my on my feet.  I'll keep you updated with any improvements. And you guys will hopefully all be able to see the effects in July!

      For those of you who appreciated my last story, I have another for you. More "classic fucking (insert my name here)" as one reader put it.  I'm always impressed with the complete inability to respond a person will have after you call them on their bad behavior. I usually figure that if they are a big enough asshole to do whatever stupid thing they have done to call out my wrath in the first place, then they would at least want to defend it. But they mostly just stand there, open mouthed and red faced.  Same thing happened when I confronted a guy on a motorcycle about his bad driving. Fist off, I hate motorcyclists. They have no concept of laws and then get pissy when someone creams them on the highway. "Start seeing motorcycles"? Yeah I'll do that when you start seeing the lines on the road.  So, I'm driving down this busy street in Monterey. It's one of the few roads off the penninsula and it's 5 pm, so needless to say, it's pretty busy. This guy on the motorcycle behind me keeps acting like he's going to pass me in my own lane. I keep watching him and if he goes right, so do I. and if he goes left, so do I. I wasn't going to let him around me. Why should he get to cut through traffic like that?  We were approaching the entrance to the Navy base there in town, and when we got about 7 or 8 cars from the right turn, he bolts up the right hand side of my lane and turns. Keep in mind, there is no shoulder, only road and then sidewalk. There is almost always a line to get into this particular base and today was no exception, so I decided to turn in behind him. I parked my car in the line and got out. I walked right up next to him and said "excuse me. You were just driving behind me, and now you are in front of me. I'd like you to know that MY LANE, is exactly that. And next time you drive in someone's lane with them, I hope they turn right into the side of you and spread you all over the pavement. Cause I know that's what I plan on doing. I have the right to drive however I want in my lane. And furthermore, If you were in front of me and I decided to pull up and share your lane, you'd be pissed. So how about you have a little respect for everyone else on the road, ok?"  He looked at me for what seemed like 20 seconds (I'm sure it was shorter) and was unable to come up with an intelligent word, or even an unintelligent word. He just sat there looking at me like I'd told him I just shot his dog, and I liked it. So I turned around, got back in my car and drove away.

      Boy do I have great bitch session in store for you.  See, in case you don't know, I'm about to get married. In 16 days and 19 hours to be exact. And I'm trying to make hotel reservations for the wedding night. I call the best hotel in our sleepy little town, and tell them I want to reserve the honeymoon suite. Granted, I was calling on a Saturday, but for God's sake, it's a HOTEL. I was informed that the woman who handles all suite reservations will not be in until Monday, therefore I couldn't make them. I said, "Excuse me? I don't think you understood, I just want to reserve it for one night, we aren't saving a block of rooms or having the wedding there or anything. We just want to stay one night in a room with a hot tub." He explained to me that only one person is allowed to make suite reservations, and she will not be in until Monday. Gotcha.  This is not an isolated incident though. Apparently there are more and more business allowing employees to get away with less than satisfactory working hours. I will show you.  I called to order cakes for the wedding. (Everyone knows that wedding cake usually tastes like crap and costs 3 times what it ought to. So we are having a small wedding cake and then having a cake buffet for desert. And if anyone really wants to, they can eat wedding cake.) I'm ordering them through a local bakery in Provo. So, I explain to the gentleman on the phone that I'd like to order some cakes. He tells me that I'll have to come in and look at some pictures and tell the cake lady what I want. "But I can't do that, see, I'm in California." And he replies, "Well, we don't do weddings in California anyway."  Do you think he really thought I didn't know that? I hope not. I hope he was just being a smart ass, because otherwise I'm not entrusting him with my cakes. So, after we got the "I'm here, but the wedding is there" thing cleared up, he tells me that I'll have to speak with the aforementioned cake lady. I said, "Ok, sounds great." *Waiting* *Waiting* *Extremely Awkward Pause* "Are you there?" I ask. "Um, yeah." "Well, are you going to get her for me?" "No, she's not in today." (Why didn't you say that to begin with you little twit?) "Alright, well, when will she be in? I will call her back." "She only works a few hours a day." "O-K, when are those hours and I will call her during them?" "They aren't consequtive." How the fuck do you order cakes from someone when they aren't ever at work for more than an hour at a time, and apparently never between the hours of 1 and 2 or after 5? I tell him that I want her to call me back today. During my lunch break (1-2 his time) since I am unable to take calls the rest of the day.  Guess what didn't happen today? Yeah that's right, no phone call. I wait till 12:30 and realize I should probably just call her before I have to start driving back to class. "Hi, is Lisa, the cake lady there today?" "Nope, she actually just left about 5 minutes ago." "Is she planning on coming back today?" "How should I know?"

      I know that I'm being really awful about updating. All I can say is that I'll try and be better after the wedding!  On another note, I'm still waiting to hear if we get Friday off or not. They can't decide if it will be too harmful to the learning process. I say just give it to us, because at this point, we won't pay attention anyway.  Man, I don't think I've ever felt so good about someone dying before.

      There is still a stack of invitations to send out. I would never have believed it would be this hard to get people's adresses. It's not like I want to send you a letter bomb, I just want you to come to my wedding.  I can hear the invites laughing at me during the night. They call "No one will come to your wedding!" It's very upsetting. Must get invites out of my house!!!

You are thorough in researching decorating possibilities, so once a decision is made you are sure it is the best available option. Your comprehensive approach to projects results in a cohesive look that friends admire. After all, it's not every day that someone gets a gift wrapped in themed paper with matching tissue!

      I got an instant message last night from my sister.&nbsp; I was away, but she wrote because she was so lonely.&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; I hate knowing that my family hurts and that I can't do anything about it.&nbsp;  I think being away from home is harder on me then it is on E.&nbsp; We have always been so close, so tight knit.&nbsp; I tried never to miss a school play, let alone a birthday.&nbsp; But now I don't have that option, and I have to remind my self constantly that I chose this life.&nbsp; The worst part is, I don't see it ever changing.&nbsp;  I don't think E and I will ever move back to the mother land.&nbsp; Our plans just don't allow for it.&nbsp; I think we'll probably end up East Coast people until we retire to the Oregon Coast.&nbsp; And that really is how I have planned things, how I want them to go. But it doesn't make it any easier when I know they need me.&nbsp; And God knows I need them...

      Two days ago I was driving onto base. Well actually, before that I was on the road heading up to base and this jackass in a big SUV cut me off. He just started changing lanes into the side of me. Seeing as my car is made from recycled Coke cans, I had no other choice but to back off and let him go in front. But I did let him know that I wasn't happy about it with a few horn blasts and some obscene gestures.  Fast forward to the gate up on base. The security guards are all gathered around with their clipboard and that mirror they stick under your car to make sure you don't have too many dead cats stuck in your undercarriage. Someone was about to get inspected. Luckily for me though, I wasn't the unfortunate smuck. Who was you ask? Well, that honor went to the asshole who cut me off. See how much your aggressive driving paid off? Thank you very much you piece of monkey slime. And may the fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits.  That is all.

      Well, no Disco Stu, but I got two DJ companies, advertising disco. Seeing that Disco Stu is a fictional character and therefore would not have his own company, I'm going to consider this a success. Way more successful than SOMEONE and his PIRATES.

      I want an ad about disco stu.  If there is an ad about disco stu, I'm hoping this will inspire it.  Remember, diso stu likes disco music!

      The really bad thing about being alone in your house, as that it allows you the luxury of thinking time. And when you run out of every day things to think about, your thoughts move to yourself. And I've been thinking about my life. Do you ever wonder if the steps you have taken have led you to the wrong place? That's what I've been wondering lately. It doesn't have anything to do with E, or my life with him. But more with my choice in extra curricular activities. I think that all my time that I've devoted to being a good sailor and a good student, have cost me more than I may ever know.

      The list came out today.  You might be asking "what list is that?"  But you would be asking the wrong question.  The right question is "who's list is that?"  Answer:  The dean's list And I am on it!

      Ok, enough with the guilt trips. I'll write already. One of my teachers taught me a new word in Arabic today. It's the term for one who can't bear to be separated from a loved one. They actually have a word for it. She told me it's going to be my new name if I don't perk up a little. The truth is, I don't feel like perking up. I'm lonely. I want my E back. He's been gone since Sunday, and I don't get him back till Saturday afternoon. It just doesn't seem right that I have to be without him already. I thought that was the point of getting married, so that you could be together. And further more, I am on this crazy diet, not by choice. I never can stick out diets of my own choosing, but this one is a little more important. I have to be on it for 2 weeks before they do my nuclear cancer scan. I don't really want a false negative or a false positive on this test, so I'm doing my best. But it is so hard. Basically all pre-packaged food has salt in it. That salt is almost guaranteed to be iodized, and therefore, off limits to me. So, unless I made it with my own two hands, it's impossible to know whether they used the right salt, or whether they put egg yolks or dairy products in it. In addition to that, have you ever read the ingredients on food? It says stuff like, "This product may contain less than 2% of the following..." It may contain? It scares me that they don't know. And if you aren't allowed to eat it, you aren't allowed to eat even 2% of it. Oh, and I'm still not properly balanced. God I sound like a wreck don't I? Well, I feel it. So, I'm tired, cold &amp; moody because of the thyroid thing. Crabby and jonesing for french fries because of the diet. And very lonely at home because of the E thing. On the plus side, the side effect of boredom is a very clean house.

      13 hours down and only 130 hours to go until I get my  E back.  I'm not sure if I'm going to make it.  All you East Coasters better have a good time hanging out with him cause you aren't getting him back for a long time.  I miss him too much when he's gone.
