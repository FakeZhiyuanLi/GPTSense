I watch finding nemo a very good  urlLink movie .  I thought it was funny.  The veryend after the  urlLink credit  laugh my ass off.  Then I watch scary  urlLink movie  2 I liked the box fighting with that black cat.  Just about the only funny part.

      Well I didn't go to  urlLink school  today.  So I played on the  urlLink internet  got a very nice emulator for nintendo and super nintendo and got a lot of good  urlLink games .  I watched shrek two and It was a good as a new  urlLink dvd .  jason has it now though.  I like pussyboots dan would like the  urlLink movie  because of him.    I am going to hell I found that out.  I steal so much from  urlLink people ,  Dvds that aren't realed yet,  freeware and emulators of my old favorate  urlLink games  and I burn new pc  urlLink games .  But I don't try to hurt anyone.  Yes I also burn cds.  I dont like the idea of buying a  urlLink cd  and not liking it so I burn all Dan's cds.  I know its some what wrong but everyone steals it human nature.  I think all this carp on  urlLink people  who  urlLink download   urlLink music  is retarded.  I found a site in russia where all  urlLink music  is a nickle but the only reason I dont do that is because its in russia No way I can get my  urlLink money  back if I screw up.  and that is how much an MC make if they sell a  urlLink cd  that happen to TRL in 95 I think.    But I do help out a lot of  urlLink people .  When Mandy lost her cell I helppd her find it.  And I help my Mom out and if Jason or Dan needed help I help them or at least try too!  So I be in where ever.  Wait were in hell now.

      Today was boring.  I have a lot of good teachers and I am in a few classes with some good friends Kevin is still short.  I haven't done that much stuff today.  I didn't see dipshit on the bus or inside school.  I downloaded a emulator and now all   I have to do is get a few games on it.  Hopefully I will get megaman x, x2, x3 if I do I will never leave the house.  Except for my top ten favorite things to do list.  That that about it.    My mom and dad are doing good.  And I have burned Dans 2 games so that is about it for me but I still cant wait for my dipshit dude across the street to go to school and I can't go to school tomorrow though which sucks for me I like school this year I really enjoy it I know I am turning onto Dan.  Everyone I didn't see in summer change some way.  Drew got his ear pierced with looks gay on him and Ben got Acme and my Acme cleared up a little.

      Today summer ended.  It are sadest but the cool thing about summer ending is school starts a new and dipshit is in high school have fun getting beat up a lot.  LOL Dan and myself Jason and MR. T hanged out together most of the day which was cool.  I like to hang out with friends.  My favorite things to do  1  Hang out with friends. 2  go to beach. 3  swim. 4  sleep.  5  eat more. 6  play sports. 7  play video games. 8  watch family guy. 9  Go to races with my dad. 10 eat.  Just a little things about me.  I also like long walks on the beach or a short pier.  Little Katie joke there.  O well sorry Katie yell at Dan for that.  I did a lot of stuff this summer.  I met booby and Katie for like a hour.  Went to 6 flags with Dan and Jason.  Went to a water park with Dan and met some crazy people.  I would have went to the worp tour with Dan but I went to Orlando FL for a week and went to Disney and the beach and got sun burned all over my back.  Went to Wisconsin dell and went on a duck (a vehicle that can go in water and go on top of land.)and went to Noah ark water park.  Helped at a church and got bite by a kid and kicked and went I blocked the kick the girl fell and I got yelled at a bite for nothing and I yelled back.  Well tomorrow we have to go on a Nazi bus drivers bus.  That's going to suck so bad.  What a bucking Nazi.  I'll try to get a pic of the Nazi on put it on the blog if I can.  O one my this "it are sadest" is put there for a joke ask Dan.

      School starts in a day.  Today I wanted to do something but no one could hang out for some reason or another.  O, well I guess all I had to do is play all out on games TV music and the internet.  My dad didn't get anything done yet on eBay like we were supposed to.  Shit happens I wonder when we all have lunch?  OR were dipshit shit is going to sit with will Dan ever become friends with Mandy again?  That's cool with a new school year you just don't know what the fuck is going to happen!!!  You don't know if you getting a girl friend or if your going to play a sport or who is going to fail a year or two DAN!!! I just like the beginning and the end of a school year a new start or a new end what will it be.   New topic you can't trust anyone anymore in my thought most people want self gain.  I just want gain I don't want to hurt anyone but I've met a lot of crazy ass people this summer.  Go to a race track and you'll find out what I'm Talking about.  Also Andy should have kept Mykell on the assistant he was really good Colin should have been kicked off a long time ago I hated that dude.   Well tomorrow I will have to go to Dan's house and hang out And hope some personal matter get resolved and everything turns out ok on this.  Which I refuse to tell.  I keep this a journal to keep my thoughts on.

      Today was fun.  We had the block party and we got the cops called on us by that bitch behind us.  Dan finally came around 8:30 PM which was lame.  I ate a raw hamburger and got sick and did a lot of fun stuff.  Me and dan decided to have sing in front of everyone. Jason thought it was the funniest thing ever.  And I mean ever.  We had a limbo contest and Dan quit and I pulled something in my back.    And I got a thought today my dad wants me to be respect full to my bitch aunt and I decided that I will speak my mind of everything I think for now on.  It's dumb but I get pissed and don't tell anyone.

      I had to go to the doctors and I got a physical. Wasn't that bad though (cough cough) then they froze of my wart on my hand. I had to take an eye exam and I can officially see.  I also got my box from ebay. Had six games all work and in good condition. Then that is about it I talked to Dan and I didn't get bit by a child today happy.  I did find out that we are getting out of school ten minutes early each day which is very cool. So that is about it for my day.

      Well, I never did this before. SO sorry if it sucks. Dan and I are talking again, which is cool because I think it was dipshit across the street that. I couldn't football which sucked really bad the school took all my stuff form my locker and I can't play then.   Mandy told Mike that I told her all kinds of stuff about him. A little kid bite me today on the are because he is little. That kid sucks so bad. Bastard. Little kids are naturally mean. I think I have a way to get back at Dipshit across the street. FYI Dipshit across the street is really Ryan kuller or kellar I think well he is naturally the biggest a$$hole in the world. His Mom sucks too!   The lady who called the cops on us on 4 of July is going to have to move her fence an entire inch off the property line. LOL bitch has no friends. Well that is about it.
