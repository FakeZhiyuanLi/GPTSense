      So, Ellie and Kristin just left a few minutes ago, (hi you two  waves , if your reading this go you people for being lame enough to go find this!) and i'm now sitting here typing this, half watching  National Lampoon's Vacation  (or really waiting for the Daily Show to come on again). We went up to Old Town where in the lot, Ellie did the worst parking job ever. She was about 2 inches from hitting the wall and I ended up reparking it. We then went to Ghirardelli's (Kris had a coupon) for ice cream sundaes. I didn't have one, but that probably was a good thing as my stomach wasn't agreeing with me for some reason. Still not quite sure why. Once they finished we walked over to Urban, looked till they closed, then headed back to my house. There, i was somehow talked into sharing my entire personal photo library and most of the rest of the pics i have. Sadly (or maybe happily) i still don't think they now the depth of my obsession with Alias and Angel. I think this is a good thing. Or is it me being the overly solitary introverted person i for some reason like to be. Why i do this i do not know, but i do. I could conjecture at why, but i really don't want to go on about it here. Particularly if Ellie and/or Kristin is reading this.  Fun. Fun. Ain't i lame. I'm going back to my tv now.

      My {evil} brother is playing that William Hung (or whatever the hell the idiot's name is!) really loud on the desktop's (i.e. my mother's computer which has waaay too much power for her, so my brother uses it all the time too) stereo. HEEEEEEEELP! But now i've moved into the living room (where the  real  stereo is. Now the evil singer is being drowned out by my Mozart CD (left over from studying for my German final). Ahhh...the sounds of pretty things. Me like pretty things. So much nicer than annoying asian guy.   Sigh.   Now, i don't actually like classical all that much, but lately it's been a nice mellower break from the stuff i normally {am forced to} listen to.  On a happier note (and far more girlie, particularly for me), i'm chatting presently with this guy i like for the second nite in a row. He was in one of my classes this last year and i seriously think he has a thing for me too, but i really don't know. I would normally act in this situation, but i'm (hopefully, i still haven't been scheduled yet) going to be working at the beach and he's got summer school here. Thus making a relationship kinda difficult. But whatever, he's fun to talk to, so i'll just run with that.  He's off. As am i (coffee with another guy friend awaits...)

      So i be home. As much as i loved Cancun, by the end of the week i just wanted to be home. I was tired, both physically and of having to avoid my mother and her wrath. The trip was fun (oh boy was the night life good [insert BIG mischievous grin here]), but yeah i just was afraid that this one week would ruin my entire summer. And with my mother there, albeit in a different room and technically a different hotel, it was a bit stressful in that way.  But i'm home now and life is good.  That and i have my internet back! I never (well actually i did, but i refused to acknowledge it) realized how much use my internet. It's kinda scary actually, but i'm gonna try not to dwell on that, after all it's   summer.  Cheers to that. I'd type more, i do have more interesting tales to spin (oh...i might transcribe my scribblings from my trip later...)

      I don't pretend to be a hard core Lakers fan. Truthfully i could be considered a fair weather fan, but i still try and follow things in and around the club. Still, i just read the news from the Lakers' camp and i think i'm gonna cry. Phil is gone. Shaq wants out. Kobe is a free agent. Malone opted out and it looks like Payton will also. (Though Malone may still be wearing the yellow and purple next year, knees allowing) That and there's talk that Fisher may leave also. Fisher, the one guy, even when he's not playing so hot, that you gotta love. This leaves us with...er...a..that russian guy who can't play d? Now i  am  gonna cry.  Wanh!  Ok, cry over, but i'm still pissed. I love the Lakers. Everybody makes fun of them for being so LA, but i'm from LA (well close enough) and i don't care. I love LA and i love the Lakers (or what's left of them i guess.)  But what i was going to post on before i got meanly distracted by Laker news, packing. I suck at packing. For one thing i always over pack, even when i think i don't. I can never find the stuff i want, or i need to do laundry to have it (like what i'm doing now). All that and i always have to do it absolute last minute. As of right now, i'm completely on track for my packing method. Go me! Not.  I normally would be telling myself to focus on the fact that 24 hours from now i'll be in beautiful Cancun Mexico with two of my amazing friends and hopefully sipping a drink of some sort. But i can seem to focus on how i'm not packed yet (and i can't really do anything about that till the dryer beeps). So to vent my almost-frustration, i type this very disjointed and meandering entry. Entertaining ain't i? Well, actually i must be if you've read this far. So ha! I  am  entertaining. Naner naner naner! Oh, wait you're not reading anymore? My mistake. Thank goodness for the   BEEP!

      My brother is watching the dumb spider-man trailer (really loud) for like the 5th time now! Is he trying to make wish i didn't have ears?!? Now is going thru the lame-trying-to-more-dramatic-than-it-is chant music! Arg!!! I hated the first movie and now i'm going to have to deal with all the yammering that will go on for the second! Yuck! The last scene of the first movie might as well have been replaced with:       There will be another movie. And yes, she knows!     Hrump! ...ok rant over.

      Today was Graduation Day for everybody, but me. I had my best friend's graduation in Orange County, another friend's graduation (which i could not go to as it was at the same time as my brother's) also in Orange County, and then there was my little brother's 8th grade graduation here at home.   My day really started with my final 2 hour final period, ap chemistry, which i spent formatting and finishing this lab-thingy. Once that was done i proceeded to (the rest needs to be read in that quickly accelerating voice) go home, find my chemistry book, returned to school, returned the chemistry book, w  a  i  t  e  d in the college/career to try and get a work permit (which i didn't get), then went to the camera store (because my digital doesn't like me and will never focus!), books to to pick up fluff reading for Cancun, picked up lunch for myself and mein Bruder, rushed home, ate the lunch that i had to scrounge for cash in my car to pay for, took shower, dried my hair enough so it wasn't dripping any more, picked clothes to wear at graduation and was off to orange county. All in the course of a little over an hour.  Now my friend's graduation was  great . I'm really glad i went. It was blissfully short. (it ran only a little over an hour) I got to see a bunch of people i know and had forgotten that they were graduating. But then i left to get home to my brother's graduation.  Seemingly big mistake.  The trip home, which normally takes 50 minutes to an hour, took me  2 freaking hours!!!  But i did make just in time to see my brother get his name called, walk across the stage-thingy (it was really more of a platform with astroturf) and sit down again. So yeah, i guess the 2 hours of hot traffic hell was worth it.  *grins*  Amazingly there was some other stuff thrown in there, but i have a feeling i'm starting to get boring (if i wasn't to start) so i'll end with this one final thing: (this is proof that as much as i like to deny it i actually am a silly teenage girl still)  Best personal moment (i.e. not involving someone else's graduation ceremony) of the Day:  I was walking to my car after [censored]'s graduation (i had to park  really  freaking far away!) and a guy (really hot guy) driving by (mind you he was in the passenger seat and the car was going at that crawl speed resulting from far too many people trying to get out a residential area at the same time), and he was totally checking me out. (A rare thing for me) And on top of that he (in front of the several other guys in the car and the other people walking behind me),   "I like your skirt."  Which i responded with a big grin and and thank you. And the best part was as i kept walking he continued to check me out as he drove away.   It may seem little and trivial to most, but it (on top of everything else good, happy, and graduationy) made my day.  Lame? Yes. Memorable? Probably. But everyday occurrence? No way. (i wish...)

      As i sit here, choosing options and filling out my profile, i realize that someone may actually read this. I realize that that prospect is doubtful, well maybe not totally, but i seriously doubt i will ever have a "captive following" like Blogger Knowledge blog-thing seems to think i might have. HA! That actually is a funny thought. Me having "captive readers," yeah maybe in that alternate life where was born Elizabeth I, last of the Tudor line instead of elizabeth  garble garble . I'm not complaining (or maybe i am?), but it's an interesting thought all the same.  Interesting.  Very  interesting.  If you, my non-existent reader, haven't figured out already,  interesting  is probably my favorite word. It can convey so many meanings, all depending on how you say it. It can be a happy, sincere 'interesting' (That's so  interesting !) or the cynical 'interesting' that can either be a yeah right buddy you're pretty damn crazy 'interesting' or a damn this problem is so out-there it's  Interesting... ). Either (or any other) way, i like the word.  It is late. (If 10 past 2 am qualifies as late on this almost-summer night) I really should go to bed. Bed. That soft thing i like to sleep on. Oh. yeah. Only problem with that theory is (because like all my theories, it is flawed) that i'm not tired. Maybe that comes from the fact that i got a good 10-11 hours sleep last night. An amazingly untroubled sleep considering i went to bed early to hide from my *wonderful* mother and her rantings over my grades. It should be even funner (you know that's technically a word now?) when my report card does finally come. Not. I'll just try not to think about that, and instead focus on what my cell phone welcome note tells me to do:   Cancun. Just think about Cancun.   And i think i will as i trot off to try and go to sleep.  ETA:  Whoot!  (or maybe O_o) i have a reader!

      I am pretty new to the blogging world (brand spankin' new actually, but whatever) and i was annoyed with the total lack of layout options on my livejournal. So, i started browsing some of my friend's blogs (those things i have addresses for but never really read) to try and figure out how to fix what was annoying me (the picture position). But instead of fixing my livejournal, i ended up here. For one thing the site is much prettier. For another...well i don't know about another, but here i am anyway.  *2* days till Cancun. Thank goodness.

       From previous blog, re-posted here:   Well, i just linked this to where i host my fan art and junk. It was very easy thanks to the fact that i use this idiot-proof site builder.   Today was an interesting mess. A big fat internal mess. I, because i'm too stupid and lazy to do much of my homework, had to deal with the repressiouns of my mother. Shall i just say  not  fun. And part of me (a huge part of me) doesn't give a rip, but my internal snitch keeps telling me, ' Yes , you do care. Remember you  want  to go to college stupid!" But there's nothing i can do about it now. School ends tomorrow, (thank GOODNESS!) i have my last final period, during which i just have to finish typing up this lab. No big. After that i'm   FREE!!!!!!!   Well, as free as you can be with a mother who is pissed off at you, but won't talk to you. But i only have to deal with that for 2 days really because then i'm off to CANCUN (can i say 'YAY!!' enough?) with 2 of my best friends. Cannot wait! My mother will be there too, but hopefully i won't have to see her much as she's staying a different room.    Off to wrap my chemistry teacher's (my ABSOLUTE favorite teacher ever!) gift.

       From previous blog, re-posted here:   So, this is my first time ever posting in this, or any other for that matter, blog. Never really quite got the concept to posting journal entries online for all to see. So, i thought i'd try it out and then reassess. Who knows, this might be the beginning of a blog obsession! Hmm...now there's an idea...   As i have nothing else to say at the moment, i'll leave you with:   later.

      A date book, a planner, a personal calendar, whatever the hell you want to call it; i have one! Why i'm so excited about this i do not know, but i am. I kinda feel like have this odd sense of purpose (which is crazy because pieces of paper strung together with dates written on them by me does not necessarily imbue purpose, but whatever), even though all i really have is the aforementioned things and the same old pseudo-aimless ways as before. I have a job, one that i do not get to work often enough, but i job i like all the same. I have friends, but a pitiful few. I desperately wish i had more, but i really seem to have the ability to pick them. My friends up at home are an illusion, and my friends here i can count on less than one hand. It really hit me last night when i was scrolling through my phone book looking something to do. I realized that i really had no one to call. No one i wanted to call that is. Lots of names and numbers, but not one (i'm ignoring the entries of my 2 friends who were working) i would want spend time with. I'd rather sit at home alone than be driven mad by sharing the same space. There's much more to this, but i'm growing depressed, and i'd rather focus on my new found (or maybe refreshed would be a better word?) purpose. (That and the rapidly climaxing  Cruel Intentions  which i have on). That and the fact that (hopefully) tomorrow is going to a be another beautiful day at the beach. At least i have that. Yay me.

      Today has been good. Now what i planned, but still good. Kris (and Ellie maybe) were supposed to come down today, but couldn't. Just my usual luck. ... But whatever, there's nothing i can do about it now. So, on with my day so far...after i talked with Kris and confirmed that she was not coming, i took my time getting up and eventually went for a run. Boy, was that fun...not. I am still really glad i finally did run though. I ran (well...more like walked with a little bit of running interspersed) from the pier to the wedge. Watched the posers try and bodysurf, that was funny. Then i ran (more actual running this time) back through the allies (the asphalt was nicer on my knees). Chatted (i.e. flirted) it up with the ferry collector, who i met yesterday or the day before and who is very hot. Stopped and chatted w/this dad i know for a while then went home and took a shower. Then when back to the beach (flirted with the same guy going back across  grin ), biked all the way to 34th Street (i had never been that far down on the beach side), came back, grabbed some pizza at Pete's, ate that while reading a bit of my book. Smiled nice at the guys working and then headed home. Where, i finally got to check my email (no practice Monday!!!!!  another grin ) and type this. Fun fun. Waaaaay more solitary than i had wanted, but still very good.  Oh, and just in case anyone cares i've trained for the past few days, and i'm going to be working a partial shift on the 4th. Go me! Really, go me! None of my patented sarcasm here, just good old fashioned grins. (Well...maybe not  old fashioned ) I've met a ton of new people, and it's really cool to have something to do (plus it makes me money!) But more on all that later. The Sopranos DVD awaits.
