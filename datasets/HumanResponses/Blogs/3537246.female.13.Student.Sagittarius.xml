       SUMMER VACATION HAS OFFICIALLY STARTED!!!! WOOHOO  hehe, I'm happy now cuz no more school! YAY. Okay, enough now. Anyway, I've been keeping busy trying not to think about school in September because I get WAYY to excited and upset at the same time. Graduation was on Wednesday (June 23) and that was a really rough time for me and in September I start High School which is exciting, yet upsetting at the same time. But Oh well..   Anyway, today I shall receive a call from my good friend and cousin  urlLink ALISON  who rocks monkey socks! And I shall phone her one day when I have the money to LOL! SORRY ALLIE!! But I shall do it, one day! Today we're supposed to go downtown to the Hamilton Harbour at Pier 4 or something to see the Haida (Some historic ship that was in the war) .. but so far we haven't gone. We'll probably go around 2-3pm.   That's about all that's going on for now.... Hmm... I'll write another time when more goes on! I shall leave with this quote: CHEESE AND BANANAS DO NOT MIX!!

      I haven't blogged in ages! I'm sorry about that! Well we finally finished the yearbook at school. YAY! That means I don't have to go back after Graduation which rocks because there will be nothing to do anyway.   I've been getting good hits on my site but as of now, I'm working on a reviews site. I will post the link up here as soon as it's all finished so keep that in mind if you would like your site reviewed.   I can't really think of what else to blog about. I'm completely out of ideas. Well, then that's all. See ya everyone!

      So yesterday we had a geography test which went totally better than I thought! It was soooooooo easy! Maybe cuz I studied haha.. But then in the afternoon we continued with the test because we didn't get finished in the morning and we had a supply teacher so everyone was like "what's the answer for this?!" it was hilarious... but of course i didn't do that.. -shifty eyes-  so total sweetness here cuz there's 11 days left of school work! YAY! and grad's on the 23rd (i think i said that .. before ..) and so yeah... :D I'm all hpyer and stuff all the time cuz I'm so excited. yep so that's all. later dudes

      Today my grandma's coming and she should be here at 9:30am... which is just great (not) cuz I wanted to get my hair all finished before she gets here and now I dunno if I'll have time.. then we gotta go shopping (me, mom and her) which should be interesting..   so turns out yesterday my teacher wasnt even there in the morning and we had this old supply teacher who I called "Mrs. Thing" because I forgot her name. =P Anyway, our class always gets noisy whenever we get supply teachers cuz we're just too damn rude (haha..) and she threatened to walk out of our classroom and everyone was like "Yeah okay!!" and they were all shocked but happy at the same time...she didnt walk out tho but people were all like "oh i can just imagine what she did to her husband if she threatens to walk out of a classroom because of a bit of noise. It was kinda funny actually!!  so yep 13 school days til Grad but 12 school days til I'm gone cuz on the 22nd is my last day of school cuz im not going on grad day. No way cuz i won't have ANY time whatsoever to get my hair done, my nails, makeup etc. and have my dress on and ready and take pictures n crap and be ready for 3 to leave at 4 and get seats at the church for 5 cuz that's when it starts... tres confusing and tres lame... but oh well.

      Thank god, our Geography test got moved to Monday which is pretty spifftastical... problem is though that we have novel notes and my teacher said that if we can't find any part of these notes that we're writing the test today! AAAAAAAH! I'll probably just tell him that I have the notes but I can't find them, He'll probably say okay because he knows im a good kid -smiles big-  I LOVE Avril's song "He wasn't" I'm listening to it now haha "Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone. He wasn't what I wanted, what I've got, no. He wouldn't even open up the door. He never made me feel like I was special. He isn't really what I'm looking for."   Woot total sweetness!!! :P Anyway yep so that's all for this post. Later dudes.

      Sooooooo what's going on in my boring, regular life? Well let's see...  Firstly, 2 people are on my back and don't like me. Second, there's 14 school days left (not counting weekends) until graduation. Thirdly, ... uh... there isn't really a third, but no one's gonna read this blog except maybe Allie sometimes if I make her... Kidding :P  So I feel very left out and very excluded and hurt and worthless because of how the two people are making me feel right now.. :( i want high school to start REALLYYYY badly... :(

      As you can tell by my title, it's been very BORING around here. Well, we went to see the Haida and it was SO COOL! We got to go inside the ship and look at all the things that were thre originally. It was cool, there was a spot where they had hammocks hanging from the ceiling where the soliders had to sleep. 40 men had to sleep and store all of their stuff in a small little space. It was incredible. I really liked it, but it scared me when I had to walk on the side of the ship because I could look over the railing and see the lake and I'm terrified of water so it was really scary.   Yea, so I got that call from Allie, we only stayed on the phone for ten minutes. It's freaky when she talks though cuz she sounds like my friend, but much older. But anyway, I got the call and it was cool, lol.   So, my grandma's over today. Not much is going on really, cuz none of my friends are home. Carolyn went to Europe and won't be home until about July 21st. So when she gets back, it'll be better cuz I'll get to hang out with her and stuff. Anyway, that's about all for now. I'm bored...
