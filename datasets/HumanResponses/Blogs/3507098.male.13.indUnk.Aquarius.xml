      So. New Journal. "Secret"-y.  Now I can say anything..and not have people yell at me for it. Go me. I just spent about half and hour trying to resize and get a picture online, but it's quite annoying so i gave up. I might try again later, but who knows.  On a fashion note (lyke, omg.), I am getting new  shoes  Sometime this week. This rainy, rainy week. Man, i hope that link thing worked. It would be amazingly cool. I'm also starting to wonder if my Go-Kart Records T-shirt wil ever come. I doubt it. It's been almost a month. But they said allow up to 4 weeks...Still. Pushing it.  I think Free Hats is going to practice this week, or this weekend. We have to, if we plan to get a show. I think i'll write songs in my new, small, floppy notebook, which is from the 80's, and awesome. Ha, the only real songs we have are "My mom thinks i'm cool", which is sort of a dumb song made up by Mike Rogers, and A.D.D. by The Unseen. Ah well. Good times. Speaking of Mike, Me, Him, and Baner all plan to go on down to LBI this summer to his hot-assed Bay-Beach-House. Maybe get a Show or two..Skinny dip the bay. Just a good time.   So long, first entry.

      Mike Rogers and I have created our very own...well lots.  1) DEVIANT ART ACCOUNTS!   Mike - Donkey-Explosives   Me - Beyond-AD  2) COMIC THING!   Further bulletins warrant.  3) BAND THING!    But you knew that already.     The end.

      So i had this really long fight with Chris and Brittany Duwallo and i so won. They won't mess with us again. I emailed the conversation to alex.   In other news, Free Hats had their first practice. We didn't really get much done, but we made progress. I'm writing like 2 songs right now. One's sort of all punkish and then the other one is more...indie-ish? I guess. For lack of better words.  So the Jazz-Ska-Punk-Fusion band idea is going over well. It's now my "side project", and i might get Dan in on it.   And me and monique have so many problems...I don't want to be mad at her all the time, but when she likes someone i just get like...so jealosus and/or mad. I don't know why. I feel like i need someone and to know that they like me, and feel compeltely secure. It's so fucked up, and she would never understand. I don't want to lose her because of this. Would i go so far to say that i love her? I don't know. It seems a tad too dramatic. And kinda lame. But man, i would lose so much without her.

      I've done alot of things today. I'm actually really proud of myself. It's kinda ironic, during school, i got no work done, but now that school is pretty much over, i'm working all the time.  I finished my Math Final. Both sections were really much easier than i expected, i think i did well, probobaly in the upper 80's/low 90's.  I also finished up my French Final, which i still have to present. The only ones left are L.A. and Science, which i'm in the middle of. I think i might do decently in some of my classes.  Dan and I got down to it yesterday; I went over to Sammy's afterschool with Mike Boehner and we worked on the Sidekick t-shirt designs. We finished them up pretty quickly, within an hour. They came out really well, you can see them here:  http://www.cafeshops.com/storekick   Yeah, I thought up that smart name. Storekick. Oh, snap.  Then today, we made and sold like one t-shirt. We're still trying to find out how we can get a good amount of t-shirts to the 19th show, but it doesn't look like that's gonna happen, we'll have to wait till either Maggie or Esther have their garage shows or the shows i can put on for free, anytime, at Teenage Wasteland.  That's another thing. That store, Teenage Wasteland, which sells used clothes at cheaper prices, was gonna have a Band Night, but it fell through. So now my neighbor, Danna, who owns the place, called me up and talked to me about advertising for her shop at my show, and also letting me organize shows at the shop, anytime, for free. Awesome.  I can't sleep, so i'm going to try and make some pins...seems i get alot of things done aty night. Oh, i got such a burst of inspriation i want to talk to myke rogers/boehner about it. I want to have a Jazz-Punk fusion band. And we could so do it. We just need a person to play Sax, cause Nick plays trumpet. Then we have drums, bass, vocals, percussion, guitar. It'll be like nothing else, and if we're good, we'll dominate.I also might design the Logo/flyer thing for all of Pen & Jen's nighttime happenin's. How exciting. Bluh, i hope i get paid...need some cash.  Other than that...nothing much has happened around here. Oh, Gabe got his like 7 grams of pot taken away. He's not in trouble. But still. You don't bring that shit to school.

      So, I've decided, in the early hours of the morning, that I am starting a Comic. I don't know if it will be a comic strip, or a comic book, or maybe just some drawings.  Either way, it will be started tomorrow. If i find a way to get it on the computer, i've decided to put it here first, then Mike Rogers and I are doing a weekly comic on Sidekick eventually.   The comic will be about life, and stuff like that. Characters...based off people i know. Myself, monique, grace, alex, Mike, Myke...and on. Plot? Well, if it's going to be a comic about life, there is no plot. There is no plot to life. What happens happens. In life, you don't always come out on top, and you don't grow emotionally or physically from events. Sometimes in life, days go by, and it's just a slice of your life, gone. And this comic will be just like that. Wish I had photoshop and a scanner though.  Tomorrow..or well, today, technically, I'm going over to Sammy's after making up some work on my Science Final. The frog smells so bad. Anyway, Dan and I are making T-shirts. Sammy will probobaly help too. And Mike B. might come. And I might have band practice this week. And i got nominated 3 times for a grammy in the poetry thing. My poetry sucks. I think the categories i had were like, best rhyming poem (serious), best performance, and best rap. I don't care if I win. I don't want to win.  I really should go to bed. I will be tired tomorrow for my Math Final...And i need to study. I really want to do well in school next year...I think i'm failing French. If not, i'm doing really really badly. 0 out of 30 Homework assignments. Shit. Oh well, french sucks. And the room smells.   I'm gonna have a cocoa puffs cereal bar and then go to bed. I wonder if monique reads my journal..i hope not. I mean, i like read hers, but that's because she's an interesting person. I'm like..not. I write about school and comic books and lindsay lohan and monique and stuff. I shouldn't have a journal. But i like to write..

      So monqiue and i got back together. It wasn't quite so dramatic as i had envisioned, but then again, nothing really is. Ha! When we were about to "part ways" on the street, I hugged her and then gave her a kiss, but she like opened her mouth and i didn't know she was gonna and i didnt have mine open so it was like whoah how does this work..it's a new version.   Ah well. We always mess up when we kiss. It's awesome.  I bought Clay's brother's band's CD, The Singularity. They're not bad, kinda generic, but they're Clay's friends, so i had to.  OH! I found ten bucks on the ground today! How awesome is that? Sammy found $5, and i saw the $10 and grabbed it.   I broke my skateboard. I'm starting to think it was a mistake.

      -I have a project to do. I should start. -However, I am preoccupied with how to get back together with monique. -I hope she doesn't hate me. -I just watched the 'Diary of Lindsay Lohan'. It was good. She likes N.E.R.D.  -I'll have to download some of them later. -Buena Bear is a very good comic. -Boy on a Stick and Slither is a good comic. -Exploding Dog is nice, but I wouldn't obsess. -I should start a comic. It would be about life. I don't think it would go anywhere. -Maybe it would. -Maybe Sidekick should have a weekly comic.  -I checked the traffic of the site last week...can you say 3,000+ ? -Why hasn't alex linked to us on 00skate. It's all the rage! (i.e., reznor is doing it ) -When will i write a song for Free Hats? -Probobaly never. Or just, not now. -I need a new skateboard. Where do i get $40? -What about that project conor...you're doing bad in school. -Level 3 here i come -Where the fuck is my mom....I forogt where she went, and she's been gone forever. -Why do my journal entries suck?

C: Just try them D: No C: Fuck you, yes D: I'M DOING IT NOW! C: FUCKING FUCK!  yeah so that's paraphrased, but that's whats going on. But apparently some HOT new site updates are coming.

      So the DEED is done. And man do i feel bad. ESPECIALLY that I did it over the internet, how queer is that, but alex has done it with grace a billion times and a few he did over the internet so i guess it's ok. I can't really imagine not being monique's boyfriedn tomorrow, hard as that may be. I waited to press that button to send it for like half an hour. But she's crazy...Ugh. LIST:   Reasons I broke up with monique for the first time, a list.  (but not in order) 1. She always is mad at me for absolutely nothing or something that normal people don't get mad at. 2. She would get mad at me for being friends with grace 3. She doesn't like my friends 4. Always calling me gay 5. Didn't really show any emotion towards me in person, or like physical contact or whatever you would call it. 6. Whenever she's mad she gives me some sort of silent treatment or otherwise 7. I felt like i was too young for her, even though it's less than a year 8. People kept talking to me about her  and it sucked 9. I sucked too much as a boyfriend...as always 10. I don't think she actually liked anything ABOUT me, maybe i was just a face 11. I thought i would have it alot easier if i didnt have a girlfriend 12. She was controling 13. Just...ok there is no 13.  But I miss her. I was so happy with her, even though i was so bad as a boyfriend and just as a person to her. I hope tomorrow we make up, and start over. Ah.

      I hate monique. Forever. I am going to break up with her. Maybe this time i mean it. She's so impossible. She gets mad at everything I do. She always is like trying to make me jealous. She doesn't care. She's crazy. Maybe we'll get back together later. But today just feels like a day to end it with her.   Damn. I'm an ass. But whatever. Girls don't realize how much they can make boys go crazy with their shit. Stop-Drop-Kaboom   I went to my Dads apartment in Hoboken yesterday. Pretty fun. I saw two really good movies: The Weather Underground and 28 Days Later. Both were amazing. Um, that's all i feel like writing. I'm going to go draw or something...

      So, Friday. The first day i've been to school in a long time, and my plans have been busted by a certain ISAAC ROJER and I hate him now for it. Forever. I might end up having to go to guidance now, and my mom might get in trouble, and then she'd be fucking pissed...Ah, well.   And I saw Harry Potter. Oh snap. It was alright, they cut alot out, which was ok though, because it was still long and kinda sucky. Well, also because everytime Rupert Grint was onscreen she would get the woozies. Ha! Yes, I can use the term Woozies and still feel confident.  Sammy and I also told of Chris Duwallo. He's just fucking annoying man, and I think if he touches me again i might have to beat him up. Because nobody likes him, he follows us everywhere, and he's fucking disgusting and he hits on monique and ashley alot and I don't mind, except for the Monique part.  Well to end the nice night i thought I'd give monique a kiss "goodnight" or whatever because we don't seem to be doing that too often, but her stepdad came, and he ended up giving me and alex a ride home....so if i had, it would've been awkward. Or, not like i didn't want to, but there was no real way too without it being really awkward. Anyway, I sat with her dog.   Ugh. Tomorrow i'm with my dad. Troubles, troubles yo. word word up in the hizzouse, peace dogz i'm OUUTTT

      Hmm, so there's one school assignment i'm interested in. The Letter. We have to write a letter to ourselves and in 5 years Mr. Palmgren will send it to us. I think it's pretty cool. At first I was thinking of sending my self pictures of me in the nude. I'm still thinking it over, but now I want to do something serious. A good letter. I think i'll write it today.  I wish I had Windows so I could do geocities. This is annoying.

      So, another day spent not at school. Oh yes conor, you're making that system fall. You anti-christ , crack smokin', guitar playing, punk rock rebel.  Cody and I went to South Orange to hand in my insurance form for the Baird Center, and along the way I saw Anton and Ken (?) and on the way back i met Doug and his friend who has no name. Highschool seems like alot of fun, just by hearing about the extra curricular classes, like tv production, and AV film making. I'm going to do fairly well next year so I can grab a good spot in Highschool.   Jon of KP fame is really a) funny, and b) nice. Everyone including Goldy liked my flyer, which isn't too bad if I may say so...myself.   And Mike Boehner has gotten mad at me today. For some reason, someone has been telling him lies. LIES, I say. Anyways, he thought I called him annoying and a 'poser skater'. What the dickens? I called him annoying when Sammy and I were really mad at him like 2 months ago, but i never called him a 'poser skater'. Who calls people that? It just sounds dumb. And like he said, he doesn't skate. So we worked it out, and we're all cool now.   If I can, i'll put the flyer up here once i can scan it. Later, hater.

      So, band i sort of do alot for, Wyatt Reloads, has decided to order up some pins. The 2 designs they've made are a gritty, black and white picture of esther doing an ollie (?!), with red letters Wyatt Reloads. The other is a black and white picture of me and "Wyatt Reloads...Will eat your babies."   Super Cute! Still, my face on a pin is nothing to complain about. Now I have to design one for Sidekick...I was thinking one of those red and white japenese 'Rising Suns', ala kamikaze, with 'Sidekick' then smaller, under it, 'records'. This can be done by hand...or in photoshop. Dan has photoshop, and I have a hand. It'll work!

      Sun on a roof.   So I have some big big plans to go see Leftover Crack and World/Inferno Friendship Society on the 26th of June with good friends Grace, Mike Boehner, and Alex, possibly a few more. It's at 3 p.m. in Brookyln, and there's another show at 8 with them, Morning Glory, and some other band. But either one will be amazing. I think i'll just say i'm going skating for the day, take a train, and arrive. Fun fun.   My mom is so annoying. I know that sounds dumb, but she really is. And it doesn't help being an alchoholic. Fuck. And I still haven't turned in my Baird Center form. It's so late. I hope they still let me have a show. Timmy's being nice with helping me get bands and stuff.   Maggie has announced that she likes me. That is too cool, because she's awesome, but i must not allow Monique to find out...She'd flip many shits. Man, i need a good Paint program. I also need Sountrack: mac, which Alex says he can get me for free. It would be awesome, but I don't know how he would.  I realized the other day...Sammy can get really annoying. Ah well, his funniness makes up for it tenfold. At least now he won't have to borrow my skateboard, Cause now he has his own! Hurrah.  Now I have to go take a Shower and do some Homework. That's the most productive thing i've done in days...When will school End!??
