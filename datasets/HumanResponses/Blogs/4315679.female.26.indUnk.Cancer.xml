      I went to bed nearly two hours ago after falling asleep during CSI.  I really really love CSI so I am always severely peeved to wake up after snoring through the ending.  Ingrate and I like to put bets on What Actually Happened.  The more outrageous the potential ending the better.  "I think an angry swarm of bees were accidently killed by the bullet causing bee-loving activists to plant the bomb."  "I think she was having an affair with her own sister which made the boyfriend jealous so he decided to kill the mother for giving birth to both of them in the first place."  I do apologize to any readers for whom the above has been a reality in their lives.  So I went to bed ages ago and woke up in the middle of a bizzare dream involving babysitting for this guy who has a bit of a thing for me (and no kids) but in the dream he is actually a stalker, you know how dreams go.  There Is A Strange Noise Outside.  I DO NOT LIKE STRANGE NOISES WHEN I AM HOME ALONE.  It is not the usual sound of possum being raped on the roof(I am convinced that with possums, it is rape every time), it is the slow steady tapping of a maniac trying to get into my home and sever my head (or at least steal the computer).  The question I have to ask myself is, do I call the police and make a fool of myself if its nothing, or do I lie here and await my death?  I do neither, I am Brave. I get up, do a quick tour of the house and realise there is no way the noise is loud enough to be of any danger to me, it is just my mind playing tricks on me.  I locate the noise, the teenage neighbour trying to break into his own bedroom and avoid waking up his Mum.  Then, to still my beating heart, I decide to blog.  Sweet, kind, gentle Blog.  You are good to me.  You would never sever my head or steal the computer from whece you came.

      You are my blog.  Mine.  This is about me.  Yes indeedy.  So I guess I'll introduce. I will do this through song.  How do you do and shake hands, shake hands, shake hands, how do you do and shake hands and state your name and business:  How do you do, I'm Amree and I will be your master, you will be my blog.  I just checked my bank account.  There is $200 which I have left in there so I can go to the dentist on Thursday and not be embarrassed when they say 'We would appreciate it if you could pay your account before you  leave' and I won't have to say,'Ooops, um, can I just take the invoice with me and I'll pay it ASAP?' and I won't get The Frown from the medical receptionist.  The Frown can apply to many situations.  People who want to speak to The Doctor.  People who are late.  Kids playing up.  People Who Cannot Pay Before They Leave.  I will not spend that money I will be good.  Its amazing how easy it is to spend $100 not know where it really went.  There was $20 on shampoo, cause it was on special as I was walking past the salon.  I bought lunch for Mum and I, that was $35.  I needed some petrol. $30.  Milk from rip-off corner shop. Plus chocolate, magazine and product-placed funky box of tissues. $20.  Easy.   My electricity bill was so high that I am now sitting in a t-shirt and undies with the heater on in protest.  I might go and turn some more lights on.  Brother, wife and their unborn child came round for dinner tonight.  They are loved and lovely.  I love them.  I especially like the quiet one (Pooku).  Pooku is very anticipated.  My Mum has bought many many things for Pooku.  We had Fajitas.   Fajitas are the first meal I ever cooked for Ingrate.  His favourite foods are green peppers and hot curry so I put two and two together and thought he might like Mexican.  I was right.  So he married me.  And we lived ungratefully ever after.  He gets back from London in 3 weeks.  Looking forward to it?  Not sure.  He has agreed to get counselling with me.  We'll see.  I should be studying.  I can see that you are going to be a very good form of procrastination, Blog.  I hope you can behave yourself.  I am very, very good at procrast.  I am Pro at crastinating.  I don't even need to clean anymore, I can just look at the mess and think about cleaning up instead of studying.  That can keep me away from the books for hours.  Ingrate said he might phone tonight.  Or tomorrow morning.  Or the morning after.  I better hang around so I can ignore it ringing the first time, so he will wonder where I am and what I am doing and then answer breathless so he will know I have a life even if he is on the other side of the world.  He will ask what I am up to and I will be mysterious and evasive.  Give me strength
