      I'm Burnt Out. It's what, the third week of summer and I'm already burnt out. Maybe getting a job wasn't such a good idea. I love it and everything, but Water Polo is taking over my life. I'm at the point right now, where I don't even want to look at the pool. The mere sight of water is disturbing. I barely shower anymore...yes, I know that's gross. I'm just at the pool too much, I feel like I live there. It's definetly too much. After this weekend, I'm just tired of games, and I have a game today and one tomorrow. Well, what can one do? I can't just say " I QUIT FOR A WEEK". Even though that sounds extremely nice. I'm just trying to take things one day at a time, becuase if I don't, I'll be overwhelmed with working, practices, and games. I'm looking forward to the weekend and its only Tuesday.  On another note, I hate when people play games with me. You know those mental games and all that crap. If you think that by trying to make me jealous or whatever that things are going to work, you're wrong, so just stop. I just hate it, because you know that the certain person is TRYING to make you jealous and its just GAY. So yeah. Things like that frustrate the crap out of me. Guys for some reason think that it works, but it doesn't. Aside from that, things are going pretty good.  The sex god has landed.   that's all i'm going to say.  Catch you later. wish me luck at my game.

      SO, I haven't been posting any detailed posts lately, I've been so busy. I've been so busy its ridiculous. So on Friday night, I had Jackie, Lauren, and Katheryne spend the night. I've been through so much with these girls, that when we're together..we're UNSTOPPABLE.. ok..in other words,we're just crazy. I've known them longer than I've known anyone. SO we had a really good night, saw Dodgeball and it was pretty funny. Then we took some pics at my house and it was all good. I didn't go to sleep until 5 30, the next morning I had a tournament and I was DEAD. But...weirdly enough, I think I played the best two games ever. I set, and I have to admit, I was all over it. I scored, time after time. I was really proud of myself and my team for our efforts. SO yeah came home and I was D E A D... like no joke. I think i went to sleep at like 8 or 9. SO I was all rested and EVERYTHING, so you'd think I would do good today, I did.. OKay. Just had a rough time. But yeah, afterwards, I went to Big Z's with Jr. and JEn and i had fun( well sort of) I'm so tired, i'll try and post more often on here.

      SO I spent the entire weekend in Big Bear. WIth my family, and you know what?!?! I totally expected it to be much worse than it was. And it wasn't bad, actually it wasn't bad at all. My parents were totally cool and Adam..well Adam was bouncing off the walls. But how could I expect more from him? I took a few pictures...met a few people. And besides that had a mellow time. Yesterday though, Angie called me and told me that I am indeed going to Florida next month with the team!!!!!!! OMG.. i almost peed myself right there on the spot. I'm so excited! I don't think anyone knows how excited I am. The program that lets me put pictures on here is being stupid, so I will try to put more pictures on here later. As of right now i'm losing my patience with technology. Today is my first game for summer league and I'm totally cool....lol yeah right i'm nervous. I'm really nervous right now, maybe its because we'll actually see what our team is going to look like for next season and how we'll all play together.. oh well.. we'll see. I'll tell you guys the outcome later. XOXOXOX see ya!

      I just got back from inservice and we watched a live birth video. Yes, Live Birth. And when I say LIVE, I mean it. Some lady decided to call in and wanted to have a camera set there while she was giving birth. SO yes, zoom in and all. IT was DISGUSTING. First of all, You see EVERYTHING. The birth part in it self wasn't so bad, but what came OUT of her VAGINA AFTER the birth. It looks like a liver, it was the placenta and it kind of just plopped out of there. (GAG) Think it's bad enough reading about it, try WATCHING IT!!!! So after that the lady just lifts up her shirt and starts to breast feed, at this point i'm thinking "what the hell am I doing here". After the wonderful video was over, I swore that I was never having SEX. Okay, the momment I said it, i was like...umm... OK maybe no sex with no protection. Because I never want to get pregnant. UGh. Blugh.. Gragggle. Deeeeesgusting. anyways, today I'm going to Nikki's casa! And tomorrow is my very first day on the job. Hell Yeah bitches!

      I am T I R E D. And it is just Tuesday. How do you know when you are getting into other people's business? Let's hypothetically say that you are not happy with what someone is doing and how they are treating other people around you. Do you say something? And let's say hypothetically it's driving you crazy and hurting you inside and you don't know why. What the hell do you do? So Hypothetically, would you just sit back and watch a friendship being destroyed? Or would you take action? Idk. see ya

      I started working today, well technically it was just inservice. Meaning, we went over all the stuff that is supposed to be cemented into our little brains. So today, I re-learned CPR, Rescue breathing, and surveying the scene. I don't know if it is just me, but I cannot seem to remember the breaths/counts/compressions/rotations for each different situation. Maybe I'm just not right for being a lifeguard. HA..who am I kidding, with these good looks I'm bound to be a lifeguard. But yeah, I'll just have to go over and study my little lifeguard handbook tonight before tomorrow morning. After work I went out to lunch with Kat, Kody, and Jeremy. I had a blast, we not only stuffed ourselves with food, we got ice cream afterwards and then we went to the a r c a d e. We are so cool, the guy working in the arcade was a prat, he wouldn't give kat another piece of candy because she was short by 3 tickets..COME ON WHAT'S IT TO U MAN!??!! After the arcade, we went to Bed Bath and Beyond and I showed all of them the (loud manly voice) MASSSAAGE CHAIR! They loved it, I know I did! I want to steal that thing, it is so freaking cool. Since my mom is a masoose, I know exactly what a good massage feels like, and that massage chair gives an EXCELLENT MASSAGE. I want one for my birthday. Went home, then discovered that I had practice in Westlake, Nikki (the other hot lifeguard) picked me up. Practice wasn't too challenging, but I got dominated in Set, I'm still learning position. I hate when I'm not good at something, I get so frustrated when I physically work for my side and someone gives me a bad pass or the girl just completely tackles me down.. ughh ..sorry that was some water polo talk, for those who have no idea what I am talking about, watch the offensive player in front and middle of a cage during a water polo game and u will know what I am talking about. That position is H E L L on earth, truly. But..in a way..I love it! Just knowing that when i get better at it, I know that I will dominate and score points for my team...IF i get better. Well this is one hell of a long post. I'm out.

      Went to In N Out today...(gag) quite disgusting if you ask me. My parents dragged me there and shoved a cheeseburger down my throat...Okay I had a cheeseburger by choice but I really don't like In N Out. Spent practicaly the whole day listening to KROQ and watching movies..It was "family day" you know the day that you are forced to stay home and interact with your parents.. Yep..Had a B L A S T. I didn't even bother calling any of my friends today, oh well I'll make plans for this week so I am not forced to have another fun filled day with the family. My brother, Adam thinks that I am the smartest person in the world because I know what 1,000 plus 6 is (he's in kindergarten)he spent half an hour asking me what 1,000 plus all these numbers were..he was quite fascinated with me. I start working soon, thank god! I'll be making the big bucks in no time. Until that time..catch ya'll later.

      So on Friday night I was totally, and completely tired. As I'm getting in bed, my cellphone rings..I answer it and ofcourse some guy is pranking me saying things like he's been in love with me for forever and that he wants to go on a date to the arcade with me and a bunch of really funny nonsense. He also claims that his bedtime is 9 oclock and that he wants to marry me. In the backround i hear people saying " ask her what she's wearing" and giggling. What goes around comes around? EH? I always prank call people. SO whoever called me, thanks for cracking me up. Good JOb. So I fell asleep at around 10/11?? Woke back up at 12 the next day. I think I had the best sleep of my LIFE! I went to La Reina's graduation, it was shorter and less painful than i imagined it to be. Then, I went to The Cheesecake Factory and stuffed myself with food until I couldn't BREATHE. Got home, and instead of making plans with my friends...I decided to be cool and color with Adam. So I spent an hour and half coloring out of a Spiderman coloring book. Should I even be putting this in here? Not that you guys don't think I'm a big enough loser. lol. I have to get out of the house and do something fun soon, hey somebody, anybody call me up.

      I'm starting to think that nobody is even reading my posts, yet when I checked how many times my "blogg" was viewed, the number was slightly above 40. So...why aren't you guys "commenting" on my posts? ehh? What are they not good enough for you?! I am spilling my heart onto the computer and I don't even get a single comment. Wait, scratch that, Shar commented it! (SHAR U WERE ALWAYS MY FAVORITE) SO I hope that someone starts commenting or, I will...ok I can't really do anything but once in a while it would be nice to get some feedback from my fans..umm I mean readers. :) So I was expecting to have a funfilled day with my Pepperdine water polo Gals. I did, but only after some dissapointment. Our 16& under team got disqualified because we didn't have enough people, so I guess I am not going to Florida anymore...very dissapointed. But at this point I don't even think I could afford to go to Florida. So...Double bummer. :( Oh well what can u do? Damn luck of the draw. Maybe I'll be able to go as an 18& under alternate, but I doubt it. On a happier note, I saw HARRY POTTER 3!!! I thought it was quite good (two thumbs up) and I thought Gaby was enjoying it as much as me, so as I turned to ask her what she thought of it...I saw that she was ASLEEP! Yeah...Spent the rest of the movie alone while she was sleeping. Yeah, Felt really cool then. Just as I am feeling really cool now, writing a post that probably nobody will even read. OR bother to comment..

      Oh Yeah! One more day left. Technically only one more final period left, and I am officially a Sophomore! Wow this year has came and gone extremely fast. Today was an excellent day if I do say so myself! :) My science final was...alright lets not discuss it. But atleast this time when I was taking the test I remembered all of the material they were talking about..I just didn't know the answers. "Eenie Meenie Minie Moe" helped me a lot today. And then Goose gave me the cd I've been wanting for a while, what a nice guy eh? Then lunch went by and..it was time to go to my most dreaded final...dun DUN DUNNNN..Geometry. Well as I stared blankly at the test at my desk, I thought to myself " HEY, I remember how to do this stuf" and I actually think I did okay! Sometimes I am soo good, I amaze my own little self. I am a master of disguise..ok let's not get into that. I wish I could write EVERYTHING ON HERE..but I tend to forget that anyone who wants to can read this..It is incredibly difficult to open up to everyone in the world. OKay ..everyone in the world that has a computer.  I went to Mervyns with my mom and she was EXTREMELY ANNOYING asking me questions such as, " this picture frame, or that one?" and when I'd pick one she'd ask, " why not the other one?" AHHHH! sheesh..Housewives..    Random Song Lyric:   oh no it happend again she's cool, she's hot, she's my friend i tried for hours if so you leave me no where to go  she's unstopable unpredictable i'm so jaded calculated wrong.  Please take me home too late it's gone i bet you're sad this is the best time we ever had  i hope, hope that it lasts give in forget the past be strong when things fall apart honest this breaks my heart  she's unstopable unpredictable i'm so jaded calculated wrong.  Please take me home too late it's gone i bet you're sad this is the best time we ever had  Why did we have to go date? It's too easy to complicate be strong when things fall apart honest this breaks my heart  Please take me home too late it's gone i bet you're sad this is the best time we ever had

      So 15 minutes later I come back on this thing and I decide to make a real post. I cannot wait until summer. I just can't. The thought of having only two more days of school is driving me INSANE!! I am looking forward to Thursday because I get to hang out with my friend Gaby, one of the coolest people ALIVE. I've been irritated lately, with everything: from my parents, to some of the people who call themselves my friends... I really don't know what goes on inside people heads sometimes. Can they not see they are making STUPID decisions that ruin things completely for people around them?!?! I'll survive until Thursday afternoon. Today I had my Computer and my English final. Both of them were fairly easy, especially computers. ME and ADRIANNE give a hell of a powerpoint presentation. Narazie! (that means later in Polish)

      So I am all new to this ...really. Don't know what I shall be posting on here, but lately I've had so much on my mind that I think it is best to find some place to post all my thoughts on and have random people read them. Right now I am just stressing out about Finals. I need to do exceptionally good in the next two days...I'll pull it off..or die trying.

      I haven't been online or posted in a while because I got grounded and I couldn't use the computer...so yes, I know you are thinking "FINALLY!" I post. Well I decided I might as well post something instead of leaving you hanging while I am in Florida. Cannot wait, I'm leaving tomorrow at 3 a.m. my flight is at 6 a.m. Sheesh, you'd think that we could leave earlier. I had a tournament this weekend, and it was alright. Alright except for the fact that on Sunday I played 6 EFFING GAMES!!!! Exhausting?? yes, very!  I am really happy to leave Simi. Even if it is just for 6 days..atleast its something.  Haven't seen the  "sex god"&nbsp;  lately and maybe that is a good thing, its not like i don't have enough things on my mind. (YAWN) yeah I'm still tired from yesterdays' 6 games. I wonder how hot it is going to be in FLorida and how humid, ohh man...weather should be a beeyatch. I haven't worked in a while and strangely enough I miss working, I can't wait to start teaching lessons again ( wow never thought I would say that) Wow, 6 more weeks of summer left.. Still have to do the damn history homework.  Alright, well.... I'm off to FLORIDA! So if you want to talk to me before I leave call me today anytime until like 2 in the morning because i'll be up all night. Alright peace out homies! I'll miss you all!    -Things I'll Never Say- Avril Lavigne   I’m tugging at my hair I’m pulling at my clothes I’m trying to keep my cool I know it shows I’m staring at my feet My checks are turning red I’m searching for the words inside my head [pre-Chorus] (Cause) I’m feeling nervous Trying to be so perfect Cause I know you’re worth it You’re worth it Yeah [Chorus] If I could say what I want to say I'd say I wanna blow you... away Be with you every night Am I squeezing you too tight If I could say what I want to see I want to see you go downOn one knee Marry me today Yes, I’m wishing my life away With these things I’ll never say  It don’t do me any good It’s just a waste of time What use is it to youWhat’s on my mind If ain’t coming out We’re not going anywhere So why can’t I just tell you that I care  [Chorus] What’s wrong with my tongue These words keep slipping away I stutter, I stumble  Like I’ve got nothing to say [pre-Chorus] Yes I’m wishing my life away with these things  I’ll never say If I could say what I want to say I'd say I wanna blow you...away Be with you every night Am I squeezing you too tight If I could say what I want to see I want to see you go down On one knee Marry me today Yes, I’m wishing my life away With these things I’ll never say These things I’ll never say...

      "and if you leave here you leave me broken shattered alive I'm just a crosshair  I'm just a shot..then we can die"  -Take Me Out- Franz Ferdinand   So I've had an interesting couple of days, I have been so busy. Right Now, i'm so exhausted, I had to wake up at 7 and then go to Oaks Christian for practice, left practice, went straight to work, came home, slept, went to Royal practice. WOW! I had a really good talk with Junior on the way home tonight, it is so weird, she is the only person I truly open up to. Maybe it is becuase she is soo easy to talk to . Either way, I got something off of my chest.   The boys just left for Florida and I'm soo excited because we get to go in less than a week!!!  AHh...I can't wait!  My mom just came into my room...she's pissed at me...WOW..like that's something new.  I wish that sometimes she would just relax and not stress small stuff.   I've been online a lot, talking to "friends" and idk....its ridiculous..i need to stop going on everynight because i don't get enough sleep. I miss a lot of my friends, I really really do. There's this one person I miss soo much but for some reason i really don't want to see them right now. That might sound like a complete oxy moron, but its true, I miss that person to death, yet they are irritating me soo much right now i don't even want to bump into them...   Peace out!

      " Vindicated" by Dashboard Confessional  &nbsp;   Wow, I'm getting soo sloppy with this whole "BLOG" thing.      I just don't really have time to post, Ok that was a lie, I bet i could find time but sometimes I don't even know what to post on here. A large number of people look at this baby, wouldn't want certain people reading certain things in here...(COUGH) if u know what i mean. So I will give everyone a brief update on what's been going on. I had a tournament this weekend, it was alright...got used to playing with my Pepperdine team. Wow, some of the girls are really good.Didn't get ALL the playing time in the world, but that's understandable..I am the youngest person on the team and I sure ain't the best person on the team. I can't wait for Florida.        &nbsp;   I feel like doing something crazy and spontanios. I've had this crazy idea with dyeing my hair blonde...lol...yes i know that sounds pretty BOLD. But, I think it wouldn't look too bad and my hair is really light right now. So tell me what u think. And by blonde i dont' mean Platinum blonde..just maybe some blonde on the top and a few chunks on the bottom..idk..Either BLonde or really DARK..think DARK CHOCOLATE! hmm....we'll see.. by the begining of the year i should have my mind made up.        &nbsp;   Alright now, I'm sure everyone is dying to know about the boys (men) in my life...well..... guess what?!?!&nbsp; THERE ARE NONE! Yes, there's potential out there... but without work, potential never turns into anything. But i'm not worrying..Everyone has a summer fling, mine is just waiting to be flung at me. ;)        &nbsp;   Tried to start the history homework....just read 5 pages and decided i'd finish the chapter another day.        &nbsp;   Been working on my stomache and my buttocks alot..lol they're both looking very good. My stomach is like a two pack... Me Gusta! Since I already got my arms and my legs pretty toned..just thought i'd work on my other body parts. Eh..this whole working out this is a lot of work.        &nbsp;

      -"Somebody Told Me" by the Killers  SO today was very eventful. I finally got to sleep in...(victory dance) and it felt sooo nice. Then, I finally took a shower, I hadn't showered since Monday. It was very nice. VERY nice I might add in capital letters. SO after that I just got dressed and met Chris at the Edwards cinema. LOL, i haven't been in that place since like 5th grade. It was great, we saw "KING ARTHUR". It was pretty good I must add. Not the BEST movie I've ever seen, but it was okay. After that we walked down to rite aid and got ice cream. Chris and I both agreed that Rite AId has the best ice cream in the world. I always get Cookies and Cream that stuff is the shiznit..chris is weird, he got...what was it agian?!?! umm.... OH YEAH, he got ROcky Road and Rainbow Sherbert. Yeah sounds totally weird and random, but I can't bag on it. It was pretty good, i tried a bit. After looking around in Rite Aid ( we looked at fans, alarm clocks, remote controls) and after " playing" in the fountain. it was time to go home. I had fun, Chris ur a cool guy. HAHA... what the hell did u call that guy in the truck?!?! I can't remember but i couldn't stop laughing you say the weirdest things sometimes.  Came home, watched 2 episodes of MONK...if u don't know..don't ask.  Ate half of a whole watermelon. Checked my email 3 times..still waiting for a response. Maybe I'm waiting for nothing. I finally got my check...it was for $180. Said bye to my dad, he's leaving for 3 weeks. WOOT WOOT! I'm containing myself from dancing because i'm so happy. Tomorrow I'm working BUT, I don't work until 2 so I get to sleep in again! YEEEAHH!!!!! I work from 2 -5. Sundays aren't packed, tomorrow should be boring. I was actually planning to start on the history homework tonight..but..ehhh i'll start it tomorrow night.   Well Peace out Guys, Keep it real. I'll try to take some new pictures soon and post those suckers on here. Catch ya later!

      So If you guys haven't noticed, most/almost all of my post titles are lines from songs. So..from now on I'm going to write what the titles of the songs are( if you guys can't guess) Because the songs I use are usually songs I like A LOT. And maybe, just maybe you guys will enjoy these songs too.  So ..this song is by Hot Hot Heat, its called "NO NOt NOw"   Its amazing how a person can be so Effing busy yet still has time to think about the stupidest things and dwell on them. I've been dwelling on stuff for such a long time. GIrls are stupid..whenever we think about love we have this thing that mentally we picture a knight in shining armor that will come and rescue us from our daily stresses and sweep us away on our feet. Haha..well realitys a bitch. Maybe all along I've been expecting the guy of my dreams to seek me out and charm me and "sweep me away on his noble steed". This might sound pathetic..but secretly I think its what all girls are looking for/waiting for.  Everyone is looking for a summer fling/romance and I guess I am especially...I want to get guys out of my head. I really do. But they're everywhere. Everywhere I turn..I thought I wanted a relationship...but in reality, I don't know what I want. Maybe if I knew what I wanted this would all be easier. I'm trying to just let things happen. But I can't leave some people hanging...I feel bad, I've been leaving some certain people(noble knights) hanging..almost waiting in suspense to see what my next move might be, or what I might decide I finally want. As I was driving home with Jr. today from my game, I realized that all of us want that someone special/someone perfect. And as we were talking, I realized that the people who least deserve things get them... As of now, I'm just going to take things one day at a time and try to least focus on guys. And Maybe things will happen least expected. A wise man once told me...the best things come unexpected.

      So You've Got To Let Me Know....Should I Stay Or Should I go??  Yesterday was a blast, I went over to where I used to live. And I hung out with Lauren and Katheryne. Then I called Nathaniel and he came with us to Carl's Jr. Idk, something about yesterday just felt right.. I was with the people I know the best and spent my early days with (early days from like 5th grade) lol. We reminisced about everything...Then we saw Laurence (aka Gonzo) and Michael was going to come over. Ahh..at moments I felt like I still lived there, i was about ready to walk to my old house..:) It was so good to hang out with Nathaniel again, craziest kid I know. He would randomly scream YEEEE AHH and WWHHHH AATT?!! Like LIl John, it was soo funny. Nate..aka Man of steel. He has like a freakin 8 pack. :) I wish i had like a two pack. After a long day I came home and ever since then, i've been counting down till the fireworks. I decided that 4th of July is my favorite holiday ever. I love the fireworks. So tonight I'm gonna watch me some fireworks. :) Today when I woke up though, I was in the weirdest mood ever. I'm sick of not knowing what I want. At times, its clear what I want...but at other times ..I lose it. I don't like losing things...and lately i've been losing a lot more than my mind.  I still dont' know how to handle some situations...sigh..maybe all this will make me wiser in the end. Like some wise man once told me...What doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger.

      I haven't posted in a while, just been busy. Busy and Frustrated with things. Today was supposed to be my free day. The day where I got to do god knows what and have a blast. I made plans to hang with Chris today and go see DODGEBALL: TRUE UNDERDOG STORY and then have Rite Aid Ice Cream, but Katheryne called me first and insisted we hang out because she's only here for a few more days. SO me and Ms. Katheryne saw "THE NOTEBOOK" and I must say, if u enjoy crying at movies and feeling all Mushy Gushy afterwards, see this movie. It was really good..but i just couldn't stop crying... It was really good...really! And the guy was extremely goodlooking in the sense that at one point he was practically naked and at one point he was in an army uniform. OH yeah !!! Afterwards, we got some Panda..ofcourse. I came home, she left... then Nathaniel called me. Omg I miss that kid SOO MUCH. Me and Nate used to play video games in his room and play basketball. After that conversation, Cameron called me and I totally forgot that me and him were supposed to hang out today....Ooops.. So yeah we're hanging out tomorrow. I'm soo happy its the weekend....HUGE RELIEF!   ahh i just fell off of my computer chair..i seem to do that alot. I can't wait to see some fireworks sunday. I love fireworks. I've been thinking through things and after i talked to cameron, i decided that I might start looking for a relationship soon. I'm through with being single (even though its great) I just need someone... I'll start accepting applications from this point on. ;)
