      Hehe, Today, early in the morning we start to head towards the RIC. For? For the World Environment Day (WED) 2004!! Hehe, I am both excited and worried, cos' my group will be handling children (Not as young as the other group la)! Haha  Upon reaching RIC, we are asked to bring down the tables and chairs for the registration counter. I am like "  huh? why now then set up?  " Nevertheless, we still help them. Then, some of us are asked to go down and ask the drivers to park their car elsewhere. I am included. Wah, here comes another challenge for me... i cant speak Malay, i can only point and smile to the drivers. Though there are malays included, but they are very busy also. In the end, I become a "signboard", car comes, immediately hands up and direct them down to the parking slots. Well, they  should have assigned people there beforehand, organize everything thoroughly .  After that, the even started... Kevin, Wanchoo and I go to the hall where our stations will be started. I am impressed by the primary school kids! Though it's only colouring and using only colour pencils, they can actually blend the colours very well. The strokes and techniques used are also very pro!! Even for me, in sec sch then make use of colour tonning.... so ashame.. lol. There is this kid, stunned me. He is very young and his command of colours are very "chim"! Very nice... I am amused by him throughout this colouring session!  urlLink    "This is that boy, Timothy and his colouring piece!! Nice right?"&nbsp; urlLink     After that, is lunch time. Well, nothing much to say about lunch... lol... *ahem* Then, we proceed to our next station, a garden walk. The kids are splitted into two groups. And that boy (which i just mentioned above) happened to be in my group. He's very adorable and hyper active!! He knows malay, chinese, cantonese and english... wow pro right? He's only primary 3!!  During the garden walk, I get to know more about the boy. His name is Timothy. Chinese name: Zhen Xiao Yao (Really (care)free). When i heard his name from him, I am like " wow still got people at this era called such names ah " He's very fun and active... how I wish I have a little brother like him.  After the garden walk, we have the games session at the pavailion. Haha, all of them are engrossed with the games though some are really lame... Then Kim came with some Nemo keychains and start to ask questions. If they guess correctly, they get the keychain. Well, of coz, that Timothy gets one.  urlLink    "Timothy and some of the kids @ the pavailion"&nbsp; urlLink     Then comes the speech thingy. Some of us followed Mr Ng down to the presentation, speech thingy. I am included so are Eugene and MeiLing. Lol, before we even enter, we asked Meiling to control her luaghing pitch in any situation. hah. Then, Meiling keep telling me that the VIPs all look like terrorists (cos they hav beards and moustach) and keep giggling at herself. Then when the camera faced us, I will nudge her and we will act as though we are listening etc. Haha so fake right? Like Mr Goh loh =p Then here comes the WED mascort, a monkey. In the middle of the presentation, the monkey's pants keep dropping and Meiling is like laughing like you know... haha, but damn funnie loh, keep pulling it up.... in the end, they remove the pants... haha. Oh, after the speech and presentation, we are asked to set some fishes free into the pond. Well, some of us managed to set them free. Haha.  urlLink    "Freed the fishes!! Wanchoo caught on the act!!"&nbsp; urlLink     After that, we go up to the hall, all exhausted. Some sleep inside, 3 bridge "tables" and some playing games... lol... and WR has this love game using the poker cards... lol very interesting. And we call it a day after that...  Well, today best thing is the WED and Timothy. Really, leaves a big big memories on this very day...

      Todae, early in the morning after breakfast, we go to RIC to help up with them in the preparation of the World Environment Day 2004 (WED) which will be held tomorrow.  As the facilitators and coordinators are not there yet, and the youths are "dancing" the bamboo dance at the pavailion, we go and join them. It is very fun and interesting and the beat goes " Bom Bom Pa " and the " pa " that beat, they slide the bamboo poles one! Wow, i kena snape once... and it really hurts... It is really fun to try with... haha, esp with fast speed... keke.  urlLink    "Their bamboo dance!! Nice nice!!"&nbsp; urlLink     After that, we have a small sharring session, share about my feelings and thoughts about the foster home programme. And... i represent my group [each grp one representative] BUT 4 of us allocate the parts who talk about what.... haha, i get the most easy one... talk about plucking the vegetables... [not i choose one, i left with that option nia]. BUT we still help each other, add in more details =)  Then, we are splitted into groups again to plan and prepare our stations for tomorrow's World Environment Day 2004! My Group is incharge of colouring and games... under category 4. Firstly, we start off with the planning with Kim (one of the facillitator from RIC). We have a thorough one and that's all. Whaha, no need set up anything =p Then, all of us go and help the other groups in setting up thier stations. The bad thing is that, we could not complete all tasks before luncg, so, we have to walk all the way back to our resort and have our lunch and then walk all the way back to RIC and continue.   Then, I volunteer to go around and ask for people's t-shirt size (wahaha, free WED tee leh~~left L and XL only though). Then, i followed Eugene, Kenneth and one of the twins (I think is Liang Thing if not wrong) to hunt for leech... Wow, we really walk all the way in from the other side of the bridge till the tracks are very vague. So sad, we cant find any... (we are given a time by Mr Ng and expect us to be back by that time). Then I start to help out in getting pond water and the flush down the drain. Haha, clearing the drain is a huge "project" and we call off our day in RIC with the drains -___-""   Dinner time~ and it's Joel's Birthday!! We sing birthday songs to him in chinese, english and malay!! Wahaha, nice dinner + fresh prawns and banana!! Wow, how generous is that Mrs Lim! Wow, the best dinner man~! Thanks Joel!!!  After dinner, I have my life journey. Hmm, it's not very well-planned and I have missed a couple of things... but nevermind, I have covered most of the things I wanna say and I feel really really relieved. Now think back... my life is kinda colourful and corny! Haha, sports day, primary sch teachers, primary sch dental nurse, sec sch etc... and even YJ and sabah!! If i did not choose to stay in YJ, I would not be able to come to this expedition, which allows me to experience something new, see things in different aspects, make a bunch of great friends and of course, uncover myself.... I difinately nevery choose the wrong choice!  *And got a new nickname: Kodomo

      Heex, I woke up excitedly, as todae, we have the foster home programme.  After our breakfast, same thing, walk to RIC to meet the Sepilok youths. Since there are only 4 youths who allow us to go to their house, only 12 people can go for this exchange. I am one of them and Wanchoo and Kevin is in my group. Okae, after a small briefing, my group is assigned to Nor Liana's Aunt house, with Well-C tag along.  First, she brings us to her Aunt's house [cos her parents dont live here]. Upon reaching, we greet them with  Selamat Bagi  [good morning]. And we are recieved by a warm welcome by each of the family member. Then, we are asked to sit down and introduce ourselves. That house is fabulous man!! Nor can speak and understand English and one of her cousins can speak and understand Mandrin!  We chat for a while then her cousin show us their room. As we enter, I am like " Wow " cos' the room is very spacious, ceiling is quite high and is very neat!! Unlike mine, very cramp and messy. I also got to know their education system. It's totally different from Singapore.  Their main language is Malay, of coz, then they only get in touch with English when they are in sec sch.  In addition, unlike us, their "leveling" is by form what (number) one.  Then, they bring is around outside to meet us with their neighbours. I realise something,  they know each and every single people in the kampung . They are  very close to their neighbours  to the extend that they actually can enter their houses without calling out for them.  Unlike Singaporeans, most people dont know their neighbours well  [even those beside them]  and some even make enemy with their neighbours.  Besides,  they are not like us lor, only work work work.they have life after school one !  After that, we meet up with the others to pluck vegetables for our lunch/ The Sepilok youths teach us how to choose tapioca leaves that can be cooked and eaten [young ones, green stalks]. Also, cos' we ask for the ferns we are few daes ago in the resort, so, the youths showed us the way, quite far. It is more difficult to identify the ferns that are suitable for consuming....  urlLink    "Wahaha, posing to pluck tapioca leaves"&nbsp; urlLink     After plucking sufficient vegetables, we go back to the houses that we are assigned to. Then, we are brought to the back of the kitchen and started to wash the tapioca leaves that we have plucked. We remove the leaves from the stalks. What shock me is that they use salkt to rub against/with the leaves to clean and sqeeze the green juice [which is bitteer, they sae one loh]. After that, we wash them again with water...  urlLink    "Rubbing and washing the Tapioca leaves with salt...."&nbsp; urlLink     Next, we are asked to open a can of sadine fish. I am surprised that they do not have an can opener. Instead, they use knife to open! I tried to open the can with the knife and it really works and much more easier!!  Then, as they also have  tzutzu  [a kind of seashell, cone shape], we are asked to chop off their stomach as it cannot be eaten. I am asked to chop it. At first, I find it rather difficult to remove but after a few ones, I get the hang of it and find that is is pretty easy [kaka, one hack and it's done ;)]  urlLink    "Wahaha, chopping tzutzu!!  Wa~Ta~~"&nbsp; urlLink     Of course, after preparing these food, we have to cook them. Hehe, my first time touching a wok leh~~ First dish is the tapioca leaves with sadine fish. After heating the wok, we are asked to pour the cooking oil into the wok. It is hard to believe that it requires so much oil! Then, after "frying" the onion and garlic, we put in the tapioca leaves. To my astonishment, they put salt again.... with a pinch of MSG... [What a salty and oily dish...i thought...] Liana's Aunt put papaya leaves into a pot of water with asam and chicken. Next, we sort of fry the tzutzu in a small pot and then pour water in. After every dish, we scoop them onto a big plate.  urlLink    "Wanchoo.... doing the frying...."&nbsp; urlLink     After that, we are led into the living room to have our lunch. The different thing is that we sit on the floor and eat, using our right hand... This is something new and I would never try in Singapore. The lunch is damn nice and memorable....  After lunch, of course, we help to clean up and wash the utencils. We go to the back of the kitchen and walk down a small stairs to the washing area. There, is where we start our work. We have to squard down that type loh.... really something I could not experience at home...  urlLink    "Washing utencils... boo hoo hoo..."&nbsp; urlLink     Lol, Quite nice leh~~ after washing is games time!! They bring in the "crimson" board [Aiyo, i always forget wad is this called] Hmmm... i realise how lousy I am at aiming and flicking the seed, However, funny thing is that everytime i miss, it will reflect and hit and sometimes score! BUT still lose.... Then, I play 7 stones with Well-C. Well-C is simply too fantastic! Imagine, she can stuck at her turn for rounds!! LOL, final score, 440 VS 0 [me zero :'(]. Nice game though.  Wahaha. Then, we go to Every's house and gather. When gathered, we play murderer and I am... killed by detective... then they go and play basketball... sigh* I dont want to play basketball!! So is Eugene and most if the Sepilok youths (female, cos females there play soccer one). So I started picking up 7 stones and ask them to play... guess wad? Well-C take the stones and throw on the ground... saying not nice... haha so  need skills one hor... Well, Mell is also a pro in disguise!!  urlLink    "My group in Every's house"&nbsp; urlLink     Then Joel and company came, and we start to walk to the soccer field where a female soccer team waiting for our challenge.... I wanna play initially but is full liao... Haha, they trash our girls ad 5 minutes later, our gals team come out and boys team go in. Haha, Mr Goh scored a few goals. Their female team really bombastic! Haha, we, the bench spectators make all sort of noise and make Kallang Wave... haha!!  After that, they bring us walk shortcut back to our resort. On the way, we walk to this nice greenery where we take photos.  urlLink    "Nice bo? That is the greenery along the shortcut..."&nbsp; urlLink     Then back to our resort, we learnt Wushu from Weijie (jie) and Zijian. I am pretty enthu because I always wanna learn but have no chance... Wahaha, that's how i end my day... fun? interesting? And the whole dae, wanchoo is being chased by cats ^.^ wahaha

      Todae, we have a cave walk early in the morning, so all of us are waken up very early... [Argh! we need more sleep!!] Then, the same old thing, walk our way to RIC.  Upon reaching there, Mr Hilbert briefly tell us about the cave, what water will flow into it when that place rain, what they put sulphur there already to "chase away" the crawlies. Then before we leave our resort, Mr Ng even ask us to bring a touch with us. Then, we are even asked to pull our socks over our trackpants....  Okae, next, we are led to a part of the forest where Mr Hilbert says it is the way to the cave. We stop there and he start to brief us again. He tells us that there is this ruin house above the cave with a weeping willow tree there. In another words, the entrance of the cave there is haunted. So, we are given a blind flod to cover our eyes, not to see these "dirty" things...  Then, after we are blind folded, we are led to another part of the forest and are told that the cave is a few metres away. Then, one by one enter the cave. I am led to the raffia string and are told to bend down to go into the cave and are to be remained low thru'out the journey. I slowly walk in as I hold onto the string tightly.  In fact, I am very scare . I dont know where am I and where my friends are. I continue walking, then, I realise that the raffia string is "gone", so I call for my friends behind and can hear them coming towards me. Then, i feel the end, then I am sort of " Huh? How come there's a small tree ?" At first I thought there's water, maybe there's small trees or bush. Then, I feel the continuation of the string and started to walk. I use my legs to brush the ground in front of me to see if there is any steps or slopes. BUT the thing is there's lots of dried leaves on the ground. I am like, " Okae, must be the water brush all the leaves in ." Then I continue, I can feel the sunlight and I thought that's the end of the trail or there are pockets of holes on the cave ceiling. Then, i ignore it and keep going. I almost fall when i come to a slope, then I am like, " wow, cave has slopes ." Thru'out the journey, I keep myself low. In the end, they unfolded me and I look back.... " OMG!! NOT A CAVE!! " Heex! I feel so cheated man~~  BUT, thru'out this activity, I discover and understand alot of things. Actually,  we tend to depend on our other senses when our sense of sight is "removed".  I also found and confirmed that,  actually, I am scare of being alone, dont know where am I and what will happen next . AND,  i really trust others too much and too easily, without realising it is a lie  -_____-"  Net, we have our lunch and went back for a talk. the talk is on commercial logging and sustainable forest management. I realise that they way they do is quite environmental friendly. Then, they also split the areas into compartments for research and logging purposes.  Due to being very sleepy during the talk, they teach us a game call "Judge, Hunter, Bear" Well, I know and had played this game BUT I never knoe that we are enjoying ourslves!!  Next, we have another 2 talks on how to be a good tour guide. From these talks, though they are in Malay and i fell asleep several times, I learn alot of things. Learn some points that I even never learn in school and can be used in PW oral presentation.

      Todae, at around 1am in the morning, something paniky happened!! We are awakened by our teachers and are told that Lynn (Liyana) is bitten by a scorpion! I am like "OMG!" Scorpion is deadly, and she is allergy to insects bites and there's a bite on the neck! She is a very easy going and talkable girl. She is really great! I almost cried when I heard that. She's really really a nice person (to me la, that's what i think of her). All of us are like very paniky and worried for her. We even dont wish to continue sleeping though we are tired, just to wait for the news. Then, Mr Ng and us started to search for the creature and we found a centipede. Some boys got it and split it into several pieces. Though is is violent but they enjoy it.... Then, Mr Ng started to talk about his fwen in the army... he cried, and i can feel how he feels, and without realising, my tears are actually flowing rapidly out from my eyes... I have this fear of losing someone (though Lynn might just a friend that i just made, but it is pain to feel that... if...). Then, I started to pray for her in my heart... ALL of us wait.... AND most of us.... fall asleep in the end... -____-"  When I wake up, I am so relieved to get to know that our dear friend Liyana is fine and is gonna to be discharged soon by this afternoon. It is not a scorpion, it's a centipede! andthere is no bites on the neck!! Wah Mr Ng hor.... *speechless*  We have a light breakfast, two slices of bread with butter and a hard boiled egg. After that, we changed our clothes and head to the RIC immediately. Hmmm... todae is slightly better, everyone is catching up with the pace, maybe cos' it is the morning? Maybe? Not sure. BUT, definitely got improve.  When we get to the RIC, we have our talks... on "Rainforest" and "The wonder of Flowers Garden" [in the RIC]. tehre arent as much pictures for us to see etc during their slides presentation. Howeverm they are quite detailed when they answer our questions.  After that, the Sepilok youths have their lunch with us at our resort. There is this youth call Denly. Erm... try to make friend with him, try to talk to him BUT there is a communication breakdown between both of us [Argh! So annoying!!] I feel so handicap. So, in the end, we just smiled at each other thru'out our lunch time [and it is so weird].  Well, the "best" part of this trip is that we keep walking to and fro from our resort to the RIC. What's more? We have more "walking" when we reach RIC: The Rainforest trail and the Garden walk.  Then garden, actually very interesting though it is not completed. There are alot of nice and beautiful plants in the garden. And the surrounding is damn beautiful!!   urlLink    "Hehe, one of the water lilies =)"&nbsp; urlLink     After that, we go into the forest. It's rather an eye opener to me. there are lots of interesting tress like the Belian, Shorea Smithia etc. Then, we are led to the place with the bridge. Haah!! The bridge is not like those brick or metal ones. Ir is made with planks of wood, ropes and wires-like thinggy. It is rather shaky BUT fun!!  urlLink    "Picture taken on the bridge...cool huh?"&nbsp; urlLink     Oh ya! Still got one more thing! We learnt a song from Ms Benn. It is fun and interesting! This is how it goes:  "Hey Hey Hey. Tombali Hey. (swing arms below)  Hey Hey Hey. Tombali Hey. (swing arms on top)  Tombali Hey-oh (Clap then "hi-5" partner with right palm)  Tombali Hey-oh (Clap then "hi-5" partner with left palm)  Tombali Hey-oh Hey-oh (clap and "hi-5" partner with both palms twice)  Tombali Hey-oh Hey (sissors, paper, or stones)" Then the winner get to massage the loser... lolx...   Well, todae... WenRong and ZiJian shared a secret. Well, you know, I am K-po type though it is not written on my face. So, I go forward and ask them. OKAE, WenRong actually "shoo" me away with a serious tone. They claimed that it's their secret, cannot/wont tell the third. However, I saw them sharing with weijie (jie). At first, I am like okie.... nvm... BUT during dinner, they actually shared with Cindy and Rebecca.  I mean, what is this?  Wow, they didnt tell the third but the forth and fifth?  I feel totally left out todae.  First cos of WR thingy, then i try to go to Clarence that grp... but there's isnt much common interest that will make me fit in.... *sigh*

      Today, actually I'm rather excited beacause of the fact that we are meeting up with the local youths. It's like wondering what they look like and are they friendly that kind of stuff.  Hehe, nevertheless, we have a stretching session in the morning conducted by Miss Lim. haha! Expected!! Cos' she's a PE teacher afterall!!! Well, we still have fun while doing our stretching.  Then, after our breakfast, we have our morning walk, in the resort and around our area, accompanied by Miss Lim while Mr Goh and Mr Ng has to meet up with the Sepilok's coordinator to discuss our programmes. Hmmm, we do have fun during the walk, we sing songs and cheers, chat around, look at our surroundings etc. [The song and cheers really reminds me of my NPCC daes~~ sob sob~~] "Haha, one of the shots of our resort. Damn beautiful bahz?"&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    "This is part of the route to RIC or FRC, imagine, we have to walk this road everydae.."&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Next, we stopped by a small river/lake (or a big pond??) with a nice pavalion (which is next to the Rainforest Interpretation Center (RIC)). However, that place is full of mosquitoes and big red ants!! But we  chap siao  (heck care) and form a circle and started to play "Murderer".... I am appointed as a detective once BUT I am a lousy one!! Everyone was almost killed and I have not identify the murderer! *Sigh* nevertheless, it is very enjoyable and is a good chance to interact with each and every one of us.  The next thing is the meeting up with the Sepilok youths. On our way, I noticed that Mr Ng is sort of getting impatient of us for being walking so slow to the RIC. Most of us, who are at the front, keep asking those at the back to double up, but thet are like... *sigh*   I feel rather impatient and a little angry actually  . They are like strolling, OMG! Really treat this as a holidae trip...though i dont mind having a holidae trip =p  Okae, @ the RIC, we meet and played some games... like "Getting to know you" (Nah, it's really lame one). All of us are given a tag and is clipped on our shirt at the back, we are suppose to ask pple qns which can only ans "yes or no". Though it's lame, but we have fun and really interacted with the youths as well as the other team mates... [First name known.... Denly, the only boy in the grp of 8 youths]. Then, there's this part where we are to write our names on the masking tape and tape it on us. [Well, chinese names are harder to pronounce, so we cut our names...] WenRong > Rong (sala, wrong in Malay); me > Wei [hey hey]; Clarence > Clare; Revan > Ah Pek...etc so fun!  Then, we are being guided into their kampung areas. It is really an eye opening experience for me. Cos' those kampung, i have never seen them in Singapore before! We ask qns along the tour thru our "translator"  [our 4 noble people! Lynn, Huda, Shereene and Shafi. Well, im in Lynn's group].  However, the four groups become one big group. All the translators are too engaged with the lame riddles... and so, i stopped asking qns as I dont really have a chance to ask them... Then, I am like walking just for the sake of walking. Then, Mr Goh also teaches us something about some plants along the way, WOW thank god, at least there is smth that i can really engage in! Actually, I am  quite disappointed  with my team todae. Yes, you can have fun but in a more appropriate time! Dunno, I just have this kinda feeling todae... "One of the Kampung houses..."&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Back to the resort, during the debrief, the teachers 'shoot' us with todae's performance... *sigh* Hope that in the coming daes, we will perform better!

      Same old thing, wake up very early todae, at around 7am++ cos' we have an early flight today to Sandakan. Haha, dunno for what reason, all my roommates and I are like very sleepy though we have an early nite yesterday. We plodded our way up to the roof for breakfast. Everyone is like " Hey, why look so dead ?" "Hehe, on the roof top of the City Inn Park"&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Today, we have toast bread with butter, a suasage and an egg for breakfast. While, back in Singapore I dont usually eat breakfast, so it's kinda "sumptous" to me. With a cup of black coffee... woah, the black coffee sure waken me up!! After that, we get changed and head to the airport for a flight to Sandakan.  Haha, in the plane, it's really very short loh. Go up, and have a drink and come down already. However, we get to see Mt. Kinabalu in the airplane ^^. Upon reachinng there, we are splitted into 2 groups after we have moved all our laugages up into the vehicle. Then we start to go to Sepilok Jungle Resort (of coz in Sepilok). Haha, on the way, we have lots of fun and i get to know that there are lotta lamers in the team! Wow, im looking frward to their lame jokes! "Mt. Kinabalu...woah!"&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Well, upon reaching, we are like " Hmmm.... not that bad afterall ." as the dinning place or the cafe of the resort is quite nice la. However, when we reach the place where we are going to stay, I am like...  "..okae... at least better than pitching a tent.. ". It is just like a hall like that. As soon as we have settled down and done with the logistics, we started to gather water and mop the floor. Well, we do it in a very innovative manner, we have a mopping race! Haha, cant imagine..., it is fun though.  After that, we get to bath! Haha, I have been looking forward to it cos we will be using that place to bathe for the rest of the expedition. For both male and female, there are 2 rooms, one toilet and one bathing/washing area. However, the bathing/washing area is infested with mosquitoes, so, bo bian, have to bathe in the toilet instead. The toilet... *ahem* okie... quite clean... well, we have to bathe as fast but ironically, we only have a pail and a scoop and the water is like filling up so slowly... But nevermind, we still managed to bath and wash our clothes in the end. Oh ya, the toilet is also filled with mosquitoes... and one thing about the toilet is that IF someone turn on the tap in the first cubical, the rest of the taps in the toilet will have no water.. kaka... Well, Im well-trained in NPCC in my sec sch, so i get to bathe faster and my friends are like " Woah, did u really bathe ?" these kind of reactions. Heex!   After that, we are splitted into grps (L1, 2 and 3) to come out with our team ground rules, motto and mission. Haha, we have fun doing that though. And this reminds me of the "Internet" joke. Cos' Clarence has brought mosquitoe net, and his grp members use it to cover themselves. Then Raven, " Wow, 'In The Net' (Internet, sound like)"  and we burst out laughing hard.  Haha, due to our efficiency, we finish the dae damn fast. Once again, the teachers praise us for being very efficient. And i cam to realised that,  if a team work as a team, then it will be efficient .  Todae, it's kinda holidae mood though! Haha, but it is very fun! And today is when we have our nite sharing on this trip so far.. The embience is damn nice, imagine without lights, everywhere is very dark, there's only candle lights... wow... Well, todae, i really enjoy myselfbut really tiring. And I hope to get more friends ^^ or else i will forever stick with Wanchoo and Eugene... haha

      Woah~ Todae, I woke up very early yet very fresh despite of turning in to the bed very late at around 1am++ (wake up at 3am... X.x). So are my family members.... all wake up at the same time. With excitement, I changed into the black polo expedition tee and a pair of jeans... Haha, 3.30am.... i give each and every member from L3 a morning call, quite happy to hear their wakened and clear voice =p. Then at 4am, without further a do, i bring down all my luaggages down to a nearby bus stop and wait for Eugene's father's car to pick me up... my family members wait for me also.  It's early in the morning, there's hardly any people on the streets, and there are so many taxis drive past us, starring at us, the drivers are hopping to get their first or last trip for the dae. Then, Eugene's father finally come, and happily hop into the car. Wanchoo is inside oso, me and her is sitting at the back seats.   Without realising, we actually reached Changi airport. Well, my family also reached the airport at the same time as us. *Well, plus me, there will be 5 people in total, so cannot squeeze into a taxi, so the remaining 4 of my family take a taxi while i take Eugene's father's car. Well, after much waiting, finally, we get to check in. I bide farewell to my family as they see me entering into the departure hall.... and soon, my flights start...  Haha, this is not my first time taking a plane, but not that much too though. And I've got the window seat! Wahaha, wanchoo, who is having her first flight in her entire life wanna take the window seat but... hehehe, im evil... only let her sit during the return trip *well, nite time nicer what, see the lights of Singapore from the top, very damn nice, so is give her the previledge already =p Haha, and we sorta run into a small turbulance while we are having our "breakfast" in the plane and it is so fun man~~ imagine u cant aim the food into your mouth properly. And i heard that someone saw their water float into the air and drop back into their cups... haha. "Weee~, on Royal Brunei airplane!"&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Soon, we arrived Brunei. Though we dont really visit Brunei, we are stepping on Brunei's ground!! haha. Then, very soon, we have our transit and reached Kota Kinabalu. =)  We are recieved by a lady... hmmm... i have forgotten what is her name... and are transported to our lodging place, "City Park Inn". It's some kind of motel + hotel like that. My room number is 302, if I am not wrong and share my room with Kenneth, Clarence and Leonard. The room is like... OMG! But, it is affordable and comfortable. Too bad that the toilet cant be flushed....  After checking in and all that stuff, we went to a shopping center to have our lunch there. On our way there, there are lots of roads to cross. Maybe, as Singaporeans, we are used to wait for the traffic lights, I feel as though Im an alien who have landed on another planet... The people there just cant be bothered with the traffic lights... and as we walk in groups is like... "wow"...  In the shopping center, well, same old thing, lotta people stare at us as though like we are alien againz... but nevertheless, we still go for our lunch as usual. I dont know if the people there are very "sociable" or what, as we walk pass any store, there will be someone trying to pull you into their shop and eat. However, we (WenRong, Wei'jie', ZiJian, Eugene, Wanchoo and me) stop by a hot plate shop. I ordered a cup of Teh Tarik and a plate of sweet and sour chicken rice... yum yum~~ After we have gathered, we go to a supermarket and buy our groceries =) and headed back to the City park Inn.  All of us meet again and head towards the Central Library for a small racing game. We are splitted into two groups, I am in Mr Charles Goh's grp =) The game is something like navigation game, where we have to go to the station and take photos there to make sure that we have really been there etc... We start off with a very fast pace, then we slowed down after reaching a memorial kind of stand on the way to our first station. we slowed down cos Mr Goh mention this, "  I want you to learn something while having fun. It doesnt matter if we win or lose  ." We are like "...oh okae..." And yes, thru this game, we indeed have fun and learnt alot of things. For example, the people sell the rice in per kilograms basis while back in Singapore, such practice is no longer be found. The funny thing is, when we head back to the finishing point, few of my grp mates saw the other grp is reaching also and hinted us, so we run all the way there. The other grp saw us reaching also, they also rush, too bad, we are faster... However, the point is, we learnt something throughout this so called game. Haha, and we are all  good at navigating  now =p  After that, we go to the Handicraft center where we can find lots of handicrafts there. Then, we are given time to shop there... The items are kind of repeated in the other shops and diff shop owners offer diff prices... you can see the big diff one. And you really can bargain to get a better price... haha and that's how we (Eugene, Wanchoo and I) did... by buying alot at the same time and slash the price down =p But something happened, Meiling and Shafi failed to meet us on time... that makes all of us really worry for them... we are told to find them, thank god, we found them (they are still in the shops). However, we sensed thunderstorm is approaching... Mr Ng started to rumble Shafi and Meiling... though not really scold. And that teaches us that  if we cant meet the time given, at least inform the person who gave the time to meet...   Then, we start to walk down the street to this WaterBay Esplanade. Cool man!! nice scenery (nice sunset and sea!!) We have our dinner there. Though it's quite expensive, ven at where we have it, it's worth it lah. "Haha, a cafe @ the WaterBay Esplanade!"&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Then, we headed back to the same shopping center where we have our lunch to buy what ever we want to buy. It's quite boring here, cos' it's like I have nothing to buy and there is not much things for us to see also. So, after walking for some time, Wanchoo, Eugene and me find a place to sit down while waiting for the time to pass. After we gathered, we headed back to the City Park Inn...  Here comes the farnie part. Kenneth and Clarence get to bathe first and when they bathe half way, the water supply stopped. It's like "... what the..." Then i go down to the reception counterand ask for help.... Ms Lim is there too, she ias like "haha" -.-" then that person went to our room to check. When he comes to check, everything is fine, then he went off. So, i enter the toilet without any worry, but.... it's my turn that when I bathe half way, the water stopped running... I am like... then Clarence they all laugh like mad in the room! I have no choice, but to bathe with cold water from the tap. After bathing, then we get to know it's cos due to the water pressure.... not high enough... and i get to know that it is not our room only... my my room most jialat (serious) one.  Then, we go to the roof for a debrief... it's so damn beautiful... so many stars in the sky. Wahaha, the teachers praised us for being very very very  efficient  ! kaka. After that, we go back to our respective rooms and have an early night....

      yea i got to agree man.. if not for what mr goh said on that particular sunday night after our night walk.. it wouldnt have made us a better TEAM.. instead we would just be like a group of pple.. there to have fun.. with no purpose in mind.. it is by what he said that really makes us wanna do make a difference in this trip.. to do things seriously with a purpose.. and achieve something out of it.. hmm well, he did brought us to the right path. this trip really wouldnt had been possible without every single one of u guys.. all of us, from different family and backgrounds.. came together and form a TEAM.. working together is truly a nice and different experience.. with different pple having different abilities.. we did learn alot from one another.. and help one another along the way.. yuh.. this is what a real TEAM should be doing..  its the 3rd week since we're back in singapore.. we cant deny the fact that we still misses sabah alot.. maybe not to all of us, but def majority of us. hmm.. lets keep these sweetest and fondest memories deep in our hearts.. and keep this special and unique friendship of SaBaSkEtEeRs burning brightly.. surely we wouldnt want to see the bonds built over the 2 weeks there broken just like that right.. its def gonna be a a waste man.. we went thru so much together.. as a TEAM.. the fun.. the laughters.. the scoldings.. the long walk to and fro RIC.. the times we played cards.. the life journeys.. eating together.. rehearsing our items.. sleeping in a hall closely together.. overcoming fears.. and even bathing together for some.. so much so much more.. its def memorable right.. the 'home' to us will remain as a 'home' deep in our hearts from now.. till ever..   SaBaSkEtEeRs, u guys rocks~~~  chEerS~~~

      so long nobody blog eh.. let me start the ball rolling ba..   hmm.. today's meeting really a nice and sad one.. enjoyed being together as a TEAM, as SaBaSkEt once more.. enjoyed sitting in a circle brainstorming for ideas again.. its never dull with u guys around.. those lameness.. those laughters.. the joys and happiness we gave one another.. its really worth treasuring.. really..   the sharing session also.. somehow it bring our minds back to those memories in sabah once more isnt it.. we cant deny the fact that this is a fantastic trip.. and its really a memorable one.. i believe u guys said those words from the bottom of ya hearts just now.. lets withhold these memories together as a TEAM.. and may it never fades..   lastly, the video our dear mr goh did for us.. he spent nights doing it.. should really thanks him for that effort.. that memory that he had given us.. during the video, it really brings back lotsa memories isnt it.. everything just keeps flowing back naturally.. sigh.. lucky thing is that the lights are off la.. hehs..   but well, we're still gonna work together as a TEAM for the open house.. and hopefully many more things coming our way.. may the SaBaSkEt spirit last forever..   cheers~
