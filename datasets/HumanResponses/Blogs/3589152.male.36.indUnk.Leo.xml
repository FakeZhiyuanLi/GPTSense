         If you do not hate people who attend protests, then you just aren't paying attention.  In DC, the mecca for political protest, you cannot avoid these people.           Protests are the only source of empowering truly stupid people with a political voice.  A very small minority of protestors, particularly the celebrity ones, do make it to the talking head shows, due either to their celebrity or to the rare ability of some to sound articulate when in fact what they are saying is entirely devoid of reason.  Even when such people make it onto to the talking head shows, it is only in the midst of the media hoopla surrounding the event.  Aside from their immediacy to the media in displaying the mindlessness that compels people to travel from all over the country to hold signs and scream for seven hours, they have no staying power in the commerce of political debate.         Being a protestor takes a rare combination of low IQ, high self-esteem, and conspiratorial outlook.  And recent trends in self-esteem focused education will only produce more protestors.  (The self-esteem education works like this: when Johnny answers that 2+2=5, no one tells him he got the wrong answer; instead they tell him that math is just a tool of oppression in the West, meant to keep him down, and that math only mattered prior to when the Western world stole algebra from the Egyptians, after which it was corrupted).  In any event, this fortunately rare combination of traits is evidenced by three facts: 1) the fact that everything they say is extremely stupid; 2) the fact they are totally unaware that everything they say is extremely stupid; and 3) the fact that they think the protest is the only way for their voice to be heard, as the conservative media shut out those "who speak truth to power."       If the Soviet Union would have broached any criticism from its population, it would have slotted its protestors in the same way it chose the general profession of all of its citizens.  At a very early age, some party hack would be interviewing the school teachers, sending the smart kids off to be engineers, the athletic kids off to train for the Olympics, and the mind-numbingly dull-witted but otherwise passionate kids off to learn the nuances of drawing large letters on signs and coloring Hitler moustaches on the face the face of the Russian premiere. Oh, and don't forget shouting loudly and interrupting traffic.      Come to think of it, the commies could have delayed the downfall of communism for another hundred years if it invoked such a strategy.  No way Reagan would have fought these guys if he associated internal resistence to Soviet rule with a bunch of people who look like they were shipped to Moscow right from a Vietnam protest at Berkely. But give some protest signs to a set of really pissed off Polish union workers, who so clearly are anamolous in the role of protestor, and Reagan had no doubts about taking on the evil empire.  The Soviets simply failed to manage the face of internal protest, much as they failed to manage everything that capitalist societies provide in a decentralized fashion.  Instead of a Michael Moore, they got a  urlLink Solzhenitsyn .      The protest movement in the U.S. is a testament to the superiority of capitalism. Without any government planning, we manage to naturally get the stupidest and most extreme among us to be the harshest critics of the "system."  To win converts, our protestors devise ingenious strategies such as disrupting traffic and throwing bricks at the window fronts of Starbucks, which as a strategy is bound to attract only those more dull then themselves - those that can tolerate being stuck in traffic without coffee.  This carries with it the bonus of assembling all of the village idiots in one place, which leads to extremely efficient law enforcement.        In many ways, the issue of the protest is of little consequence, as the gathering that is afforded by any pretense of dissatisfaction carries with it the community and security of mass idiocy.  Being an idiot in a room by yourself is lonely, but being an idiot along with thousands of others is cause for celebration, and perhaps some occasional looting.         Does it go without saying that all protestors in this country are leftwing (which is not to say that all leftwingers are protestors)?  The protest is the antithesis of debate.  It is the last resort of the stupid.  It lacks all nuance and humility.  Being that stupid and arrogant may not disqualify you from an Oscar for the best documentary, but it does disqualify you from polite society, even if polite society is shrinking by the day.

         A man's memory is a strange and independent force, resisting all efforts to be dismissed by both the cacaphonous events that demand our full attention in the moment, and the ever-looming concerns over the future.  Despite such competition, your memory fights ceaselessly, and although at times it appears vanquished, it is never down for good.     In some cases, of course, this is a good thing, but in others not.  The elder and wiser man would like to think that he is better for having abandoned the passion of feeling once felt for a certain person in his life, settling instead for a stable watered-down emotion that, even if less exciting, is at least more predictable.  But his memory plays cruel tricks that undermine that conceit.  He becomes like the manic depressent submitting to medication, and giving up the "highs" in exchange for not having to bear the "lows." But for some reason, he can't put the highs out of his head - out of his memory - they stay there fixed, while the lows seem to recede into the distance.        Sometimes it is as if all of this takes place without volition, as if every time the man's eyes shut for rest, the memory revises his picture of the past.  But then something triggers him to recall these re-written memories, and though he trusts them, they are not worthy of it.  It is almost like having read a book years ago, and re-reading it again in the present, only this time each page has been altered slightly in a way that does not alter the look or feel of any given page, but changes the whole meaning of the book, making it seem more significant.        And so it was that I was recently awakened to a particularly passionate feeling for someone from my youth.  Having convinced myself that I preferred the mirror-like calm of the still lake over the towering waves of a turbulent sea, one simple event made me crave again for the crest of that youthful wave.      You tell yourself you can live without that intensity of feeling, but your memory makes a liar of you.  With one image, scent, or forgotten song, all of the things that attracted your passion to that one person come flooding into your consciousness.  And the pale substitutes for that intensity of feeling that you have chosen are revealed to you in their emptiness.      The book launch for Bill Clinton's  My Life  made me realize that I will never hate anybody with that same dedication I reserved for him from 1992 thru 2000.  John Kerry can throw other people's medals over the White House fence and straddle every political fence from thereon, but I cannot muster the same degree of disgust.  Al Gore can foam at the mouth in a pale imitation of Howard Dean, and I can barely frown. Ted Kennedy could tour the country lecturing on how to escape a car sinking into a river, and I would barely notice.  I tell myself that I have used it all up, that I'll never hate this way again, but I keep hoping.  With apologies to Dionne Warwick, a slight alteration to her lyrics sum up the way I feel:  I’ve kept the memories one by one Since you took me in I know I’ll never hate this way again  I know I’ll never hate this way again So I keep holdin’ on before the good is gone I know I’ll never hate this way again Hold on, hold on, hold on  A fool will lose tomorrow Reaching back for yesterday I won’t turn my head in sorrow If you should go away  I’ll stand here and remember Just how good it’s been And I know I’ll never hate this way again  I know I’ll never hate this way again So I keep holdin’ on before the good is gone I know I’ll never hate this way again Hold on, hold on, hold on     What hope keeps me holding on?  Hillary in 2008!

         I am dedicating the posts for the week to the virtues of hatred.  Just be gald I am only doing 1 weeks worth, as the crack young staff at the  urlLink Hatemonger's Quarterly  dedicates every post to things they hate.           I was reminded about the virtues of hate when an old childhood friend sent me the following remarks after reading my posts: "I can't belive that you are actually writing these articals. I am almost inclined to actually become a Reublican, except for the fact that within 5 miles of my palacial estate resides the largest group of registered Republican (Cuban) voters in the country....but....I hate them all."          To which I replied: "Ahh yes, hatred is the only reason I pay attention to anything anymore.  In younger and more idealistic days, I held on to certain things that I thought I loved – like Phila. Sports teams and the GOP.  As you age, you find that these things do not necessarily merit such blind infatuation, and you become cynical.  But rather than give up the ghost, you refocus your attention on things that you hate, because generally these things will not disappoint you by being unworthy of your scorn.  Rather than root for the Phils, you root against the Yanks.  Rather than root for Bush, you root against Kerry. Etc. Etc.  No hatred is 100% rationale, but if a man can’t be true to what he hates, then what does he got?  I have no idea why you hate Cuban Republicans, but I respect it nonetheless."           I for one love Cuban-Americans - they are the one ethnic minority that really pisses off Democrats - and I like that about them.  (You see - even those things I love are defined by their relationship to things I hate.)  But though my friend and I do not share the same hatreds, I think we share the sentiment that hatred is an important and undervalued emotion.  Yankees fans hate the Red Sox, and Red Sox fans hate the Yankees, but in reality the fans of both teams are more similar than not despite hating polar opposites.             It is very similar in politics - I have no problems with people on the streets of DC telling me proactively not to vote for Bush (and there are many who do); I do have problems with people who tell me to vote for Kerry.   Puleeese!  Vote for Kerry? I might be motivated to vote  against  someone if his odious qualities fit into my list of things to hate (Bush's, as you can guess, don't).  But you cannot motivate me to vote  for  practically any presidential candidate - the ego required to make the run practically disqualifies them from respect.  "Up with Dole!" rang hollow, even as "Down with Clinton" reverberated down to my bones. This is why attack ads are so valuable - give me a tenuous charge that is about 15% true to hang my hate on - and let me be on my way!

          To: Al Gore Secret Service Detail     From: Concerned Citizen     Date: June 25, 2004     Re: Location of Tipper's Medications      In the guest bathroom of the second floor, you will find Tipper's prozac on the second shelf of the medicine cabinet, behind the echinacea.  Prozac looks remarkably similar to tylenol.  Replace a handful of prozac pills with a like number of tylenol.  Each morning, volunteer to prepare Al's environmentally friendly Rain Forest Coffee Blend.  Grind one prozac pill, mix with sugar, and insert in coffee. The nation will thank you!  ************************************************************************      The man has clearly gone insane. As  urlLink Lileks  informs us this morning, "he coined a new term for the Internet critics of his positions: digital brownshirts."  Calling his critics Nazis! It sends a chill down my free speech-loving spine.  He came up with his new term of affection for us bloggers in a speech accusing W. of lying about the connection between al Queda and Iraq:  "Beginning very soon after the attacks of 9/11, President Bush made a decision to start mentioning Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein in the same breath in a cynical mantra designed to fuse them together as one in the public's mind."      But wait a minute, it seems only 12 years ago, I can distinctly remember the day, I was watching Larry King Live (fade to dream sequence):   IN 1992, AL GORE ATTACKED PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH FOR IGNORING IRAQ'S TIES TO TERRORISM. SEN. AL GORE: “[W]hen George Bush took office, he should have reevaluated what our relationship was with Iraq ...” CNN’S LARRY KING: “Well ...” GORE: “Let me finish, just briefly. Instead, he stepped up the foreign aid to Iraq, and he looked the other way when there were repeated incidents of terrorism in which Iraq had a part, terrorists operating openly in Baghdad, and repeated warnings from our national security people telling the Bush administration that Saddam was on a crash program to develop nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. And he overruled a lot of his advisers and extended another billion dollars of foreign aid, and the U.S. taxpayers are right now having to bail out Saddam Hussein for almost $2 billion. Just like the savings and loan bailout, now it’s the Saddam Hussein bailout, and it shouldn’t have taken place.” (CNN’s “Larry King Live,” 10/5/92)  IN 1992, GORE SAID BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS “CODDLING” SADDAM AND IGNORING HIS PURSUIT OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. “Democratic vice presidential nominee Al Gore Tuesday attacked what the Bush campaign views as its strongest asset, as he charged the president caused the gulf war by ‘coddling’ Saddam Hussein. … He said recent evidence - including published reports and documents from congressional hearings - contradicts Bush’s assertions he did nothing to enhance Saddam’s development of weapons of mass destruction before Saddam invaded Kuwait. Gore said both the Reagan and Bush administrations received regular intelligence ‘warnings’ that Saddam was aiding terrorists and was bent on building such weapons.” (Sam Vincent Meddis, “Gore Assails Bush On Iraq Policy,” USA Today, 9/30/92)       Substitute any Democratic critic of the claim that Iraq and al Queda were in cahoots with each other for Al Gore, and I'll bet you can find their Larry King moment in about two seconds with Google.  They ought to make a board game out of matching contradictory quotes to the liberal. Hopefully the prozac will help.  I live in Gore's neighborhood (about a half a mile away - its an economically diverse neighborhood, trust me), and it is really hard to sell a house when your neighbors are visibly insane.  Good thing he never got his hands on the nuclear football!

         There is no unifying theme to today's blog.  Just a couple of random thoughts, and the testing of actually setting up a link to other blogs on the internet so that I can direct you to people who can actually write, and who even get paid for it.  *  First, a reader writes to suggest that today's blog should be dedicated to the 90210 reunion that aired on VH1 last night.  Unfortunately, as much as this topic interests me, yesterday I was living the Life or Reilly (or Hageman, if you know him); I played hookie from work so I could go tackle the links of Bretton Woods (a private golf course owned by the IMF), and followed that up by drinking copious beers at an outdoor bar until after the 90210 special had ended.  I lack Tivo, ergo my only comment is that, if Shannon Doherty was not there, it was no reunion!  I welcome commentary from anyone who did see it.  *  Second, judging by the comments received to past blogs, it seems that my Lakers hating article was the only one that sparked great interest.  It makes me think I should write more about sports, but somehow I doubted that a celebration of Reteif Goosen's victory over Phil Mickelson would not generate the same visceral reactions that expressed hatred in the Lakers seems to.  Aside from the man breasts, I couldn't think of compelling reasons to hate Phil Mickelson and revel in his defeat.    *  Third, no blog is complete without some politics. Here I will address the logic of the "not enough troops on the ground" argument in Iraq.  The argument is self-explanatory, but the logic that underlies it is never questioned.  It amounts to the same old liberal piety that is applied to domestic issues, such as education - more is always better.  It would seem to me that this would make sense if there was an Iraqi army holed up in one spot and ready to go at us, but we pretty much demolished that Army in all of ten days.    The opposition we now face is geographically very dispersed, and none of it is wearing a uniform.  It is a far different challenge.  Because we have bent over backwards to limit the collateral damage of tyring to vanquish such elements, we have limited our ability to go where these guys are and route them out.  But whether or not we choose to do that, I don't see how more troops is the answer.  If you've seen the movie Black Hawk Down, ask yourself the question of whether more troops for that specific mission would have led to anything other than more American deaths.  In that case, more troops would have only meant more targets for enemy combatants, and no greater probability of success.  *  Lastly, a test to see if I can actually create a link.  I am linking to  urlLink Lileks.com , a Minnesotan who actually lives in my old neighborhood in Southwest Minneapolis.  He is a reformed liberal living in a neighborhood that sported more "No War in Iraq" yardsigns than trees, and the neighborhood has lots of trees.  Today, apparently, those signs have been replaced with "Get Halliburton Out of Iraq." His daily posting is rather quixotic; a mix of everyday life observations and a few political rantings, or which todays is typical. Hope you enjoy.

          I suppose it was highly presumptuous of me to provide a 4 paragraph summary of Clinton's memoirs that precludes the need for you to read 900 pages of his lip-biting blather, without leaving you with other reading alternatives to carry with you to the beach.  Let me now ammend that discourtesy.          For those of you looking for a good read this summer, I highly recommend The Perfect Mile, the story of Roger Bannister's pursuit of the sub-4 minute mile fifty years ago. Bannister was in a virtual race with an Aussie, John Landy, and an American, Wes Santee; I say virtual because Santee never faced either Landy or Bannister head to head, and Bannister and Landy, aside from racing against each other in the Helsinki Olympics of 1952 when Landy was a nobody, didn't race each other until shortly after each had broken the 4 minute mile.  Landy did it six weeks after Bannister ran 3:59.6, eclipsing Bannister's world mark by 1.6 seconds.  Landy came to Finland that summer to escape the Australian winter because he knew he wouldn't be able to wait out another season without either Bannister or Santee going sub-4.           Bannister trained with two Brits who rabbited him through the first 3.5 laps, at which point he brought it home himself.  Santee, in contrast, was told by the AAU, the governing body of amateur athletics at the time in the US, that if there was any hint that someone was rabbitting him, they would not recognize any American record.  Landy, like Santee, never ran with a rabbit, and ran about 6 sub 4:02 miles, leading each from start to finish, prior to Bannister reaching the coveted milestone. When Landy finally did break the record, it was when Bannister's primary rabbit, Chris Chadaway, traveled to Finland to race Landy; though Landy led from the first lap on, Chadaway stayed on his heels for 3+ laps, which was enough to push Landy.  Santee never broke 4 minutes in the mile, as his running career was cut very short when he entered the Marines shortly after college.  He had a devastating kick, and many believed at the time that he would have won any head to head race with his 2 international rivals.          The singular pursuit of the distinction of running the first sub-4 minute mile made for a riveting story.  Another book (far less light), that deals with similarly amazing human efforts is entitled the Riemann Hypothesis, subtitled the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics. In A Beautiful Mind, the movie about John Nash, there is a scene where he incoherently lectures to a hall filled with mathematicians, after having claimed that he would prove the Riemann Hypothesis. He was institutionalized shortly after that lecture, and some speculate that he was driven mad by the effort to prove Riemann.          The author also tells the recent story of the 1996 solving of what was considered the second greatest unsolved problem in mathematics, called Fermat's last theorem.  The mathematician who solved it is Andrew Wiles, of Princeton University.  He toiled away on the problem for years, making progress, but never discussing his efforts, or even that he was making efforts, to prove a theory that eluded the best efforts of mathematicians for over a century. When he was convinced he had finally proved it, and came out with his proof, many mathematicians who had been toling on the proof for years resented his isolated efforts.  They knew that progress he had made six years ago was ahead of where they stood even in 1996, and resented the fact that they spent so much time on dead-ends they could had avoided had they known of his progress.           There is a similarity to the stories - Bannister and Wiles had the faith in themselves that allowed them to attempt to overcome challenges that had eluded the best efforts of many fine men who came before them, and in the face of many who no doubt said such feats were impossible. But there is also an interesting difference - Landy could still try to eclipse Bannister's world record, even if he couldn't be the first to run sub-4.  In contrast, there is no satisfaction in being a mathematician who fails to prove the Reimann Hypothesis, but sees it done by another. Unlike Landy, proving the same hypothesis a month later in a slightly more elegant manner brings no accolades.  That makes for interesting competition - it is the intellectual equivalent of the primitive form of basketball played by the Aztecs, where the loser, rather than being able to go back and sharpen his game in preparation for the next, got his head chopped off.       The name Bannister is well known among most sports fans, and perhaps always will be.  Wiles, as a mathemetician, enjoys less general fame, but believe it or not, his efforts led to an off-Broadway musical entitled Fermat's Last Tango, wherein the following immortal lines are spoken:     "In order to transform your elliptic curves into Galois representations so they could be counted against the set of modular forms, you assumed they met the requirements of an Euler system, when in fact they do not!"     Not exactly Shakespeare, but of course Fermat's Last Theorem (let alone its proof) doesn't pre-date Shakespeare, so who knows - maybe with different timing?  The good news for you is that you don't have to read the book - just go see the musical.  And the same goes the Perfect Mile, which reportedly is being made into a movie by the makers of Seabiscuit.

      "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban. I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame. I was a father to the poor, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know. I broke the fangs of the unrighteous, and made him drop his prey from his teeth."     I don't plan to read My Life, the memoirs of our lip-biting former president, because I think I can guess the story. The above lines are from the Book of Job, that famous biblical character who lived righteously, but got little earthly good fortune in exchange.  These lines no doubt capture Clinton's self-perception (although one shouldn't take the "father to the poor" part too literally, as I am sure he lived by the bumper sticker adage not too bed a pro-lifer), and as such probably summarize the entire pre-impeachment portion of his memoirs.      When he tackles impeachment, the story will no doubt again closely parallel Job's soliloqy:  "On my right hand the rabble rise, they drive me forth, they cast up against me their ways of destruction. They break up my path, they promote my calamity; no one restrains them. As through a wide breach they come; amid the crash they roll on. Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud."      As one writer as already pointed out, the book will clearly omit any admissions of wrong-doing in connection to matters where there are no dress stains that have established the undeniable facts.  There'll be no mention of Kathleen Willey or Paula Jones or Juanita Broderick.  And this is where one could argue My Life diverges from Job.  Job, in the course of his soliloquy, says that he could understand the miseries that God has bestowed at his feet if he had not lived righteously, listing out the sins that would have merited the fate that has befallen him:  "I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I look upon a virgin?"       But even here, Clinton clearly broke no such covenant with himself unless the definition of virgin has been vastly undermined in recent years.  He gets into trouble, however, a few lines later:  "If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door; then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her."     Any takers?  I didn't think so.

          Late last week it was reported that Hezbollah, the people that bring you the exploding Palestinian suicide bombers, are offering to help Michael Moore distribute his latest film, Farenheit 911, in the United Arab Emerites.  As much as you may think that Moore is against the war of terror, the willingness of Hezbollah to aid Moore might suggest otherwise.      You see, it takes money and other resources to do anything, including getting a film that lionizes the terrorists that the Bush administration is oppressing distributed in Middle East countries teeming with such oppressed terrorists.  And those resources, once diverted to playing movie deal-maker, reduce the pool of funds available for paying the families of suicide bombers $25K per each mentally retarded teen-age son they convince to blow up a bus in Israel, preferably one with many women and children.        It could be argued the other way, so that it is not clear that Moore is really reducing the supply of suicide bombers.  Clearly Hezbollah is making an investment - if enough people see this movie, goes the logic, we may be able to lower the per-suicide bomber family stipend to $20K, without reducing the supply.  If the resources invested in movie distribution are less than the aggregate savings brought about by knocking $5K off of the going rate for hastening young teen-age boys to a paradise that will greet them with 70 (count them, 70!) virgins for killing infidels, Hezbollah might get a pretty decent return on its investment.  And with interest rates as low as they are these days in the U.S., there may be no better investments available for Hezbollah.        But I doubt this is the case.  Hezbollah would be much better off pressuring some mullah to issue a fatwah that ups the number of virgins from 70.  My bet is that the supply of suicide bombers is much more sensitive to the "virgin" price offered directly to the bomber than to the American dollar price offered to his family.  And surely it wouldn't take much to convince the mullahs.      So let me be the first to thank Michael Moore, the exception to the rule that Europeans hate Americans because we are fat, rude, and obnoxious.  His standing ovation at the Cannes film festival gives hope to all fat, rude, and obnoxious Americans that have feared travel to the continent.  As long as you are a left-wing nutbag with a propensity to make movies that spell out the c-o-n-s-p-i-r-a-c-y that is the Bush administration, you don't even have to speak French while loudly ordering and insisting upon an off-the-menu cheeseburger in a Parisian cafe.  Merci monsour, right away!      I'd recommend Moore for the Nobel Peace Prize for the beneficent effect of his movie - diverting Hezbollah from more lucrative investments in terror.  But then again, my priorities are not those of the Nobel committee - they might do the same, but for different reasons.  If Farenheit 911 has any negative effect on the Bush administration, surely Moore would merit deep consideration from the committe. If Jimmy Carter can win it for criticizing Bush, why not Moore?  But if the committe recognizes the unintended consequences of Moore's movie suggested here - that Hezbollah will be distracted - it could work against him.  Because a blow against an organization deeply loved by Yassir Arafat, another proud Nobel Winner, cannot be a feather in Moore's cap.

      A reader writes to give me comments on the dedicated purpose of the website, and its connection to my midlife crisis.  Being of similar age, said reader took umbrage at the notion that the middle age tag applies to our age cohort.  It got me thinking back to the print version of Ideas Hatched, when I recounted when I first realized I slipped the bonds of youth.  Here it is, from the archives, specifically August 1999 ...                Just yesterday, it was easier for me to count working days than vacation days, I could pass entire summers wearing short pants, I spent at least 200 hours per year arguing that the 1983 Philadelphia 76ers were greatest team ever, and I was well informed of most drink specials for bars within a reasonable radius of my digs. 	Today, almost inexplicably, I awoke in the top floor of a townhome that has a thirty year mortgage attached to it, next to a wife who is two months from delivering twins.  She rushed me out the door to board a train that carries thousands of faceless commuters into a major city where I sit at a desk all day long, five days a week, 48 weeks a year.  I wear ties more often than shorts, and I couldn't point out the nearest bar. 	Until now, I could handle all of these lifestyle changes and new- found responsibilities, and still cling to the delusion that I am in the prime of my youth.  But there is one piece of evidence that serves as a mild slap in the face: the brand new Ford Windstar minivan that sits in my garage. 	It is the first brand new car I have ever purchased, and its not exactly the one anyone dreams of having in high school.  The minivan is the modern day equivalent to your dad’s old station-wagon, which was fine for a dad, but isn’t exactly a boon to the social life of someone in his youth.  I am left with either the vain hope that the minivan will become fashionable among young jet-setters, or the harsh realization that I am now middle-aged. 	It is an irreversible course, I am afraid, and can lead to only one thing – old age, marked by the purchase of a Lincoln (which I am actually looking forward to owning).  Of course, the reality of one’s situation is always independent from one’s perception of the same.  I was in fact middle aged the day before I bought the minivan, but it never quite hit me.  I could perhaps have delayed the realization as so many others try to – by purchasing a sport utility vehicle instead.  But the minivan is far more practical, and practicality is the hallmark of being middle aged. 	I negotiated the price of the car in what I believe was an effective manner.  The salesman and I went back and forth for a few days before we settled on a price.  I could tell you I got a great deal on the car, but who have you ever met that has confessed: “I got taken to the cleaners on this one – the salesman must have seen me coming from a mile away.”  	Only the salesman himself will ever know if I did well in comparison to other negotiators,  but whether I got the best of him or not, he at least had the masochistic consolation of witnessing me forever giving up my youth.  Or maybe he let me off easy with the knowledge that by the time I come back for a new car, the fight will be so beaten out of me that I will readily pay the sticker price. 	I think back to all other major life events – baptism, first communion, confirmation, various graduations, and marriage.  All of them mark the passage from an old life to a new one, and all do so through two central mechanisms: ceremony and celebration.  But in each of those occasions, though we generally leave the old life behind with some sadness, there is much to look forward to in the new one. And we usually have alcohol and the presence of family and friends to smooth over the transition. But passage into middle age is conspicuously lacking in both ceremony and celebration.  We are simply left to slide into it, perhaps under the hope that we simply won’t recognize the incremental difference.  Just as in any other passage that proceeds it, there is a lot to look forward to, but middle agedness alone requires the purchase of life insurance, forcing some of us to confront our mortality for the first time.  Now maybe this is nothing to celebrate, but a few friends and a few beers would make it a lot easier to ignore the whole aging process.  And who knows, maybe a month could be set aside for men and women passing into middle age to live as they did in their early twenties.  We are made immune to diseases like polio with a small dose of the disease itself – why not cure the midlife crisis in the same way? It is high time for some sort of ceremony and celebration for middle aged people.  It is too late for me.  It was too late for most of my friends years ago.  But it’s not too late for the children!  Lets do it for the children!

      For those few of you who once upon a time received the print version of Ideas Hatched, this, like yesterday's post, is a re-run.  But now that at least a billion people could theoretically log on to this site, don't you think it would be selfish of you to demand a ban on material that is only stale to you?  This appeared in the June 99 edition.  Consistent with the theme below, which family do you think Jesse Jackson is spending Father's Day with?       About one year ago, Al Gore took the opportunity during a speech to announce the latest finding from high-tech social science: that fathers are actually an important element in the proper development of children.  Mr. Gore is not the only one who requires some scientific backing to feel safe in making such statements.  Remember  that it was only seven years ago when liberals howled with indignation when Dan Quayle criticized the fictional character Murphy Brown for deliberately having a child with no intention of providing it  a fatherly presence.  That controversy actually stimulated work for sociologists who wanted to find out if fathers actually did matter.  Only in pseudo-scientific sociology, and among liberals bent on trying not to offend feminists, does common sense become a debatable topic to be resolved by scientists. 	      There is much to lament this Father’s day for the respect society accords to fatherhood.  While Dan Quayle was reminded patronizingly that Murphy Brown was a fictional character, the show was nevertheless reflecting a disturbing reality.  Madonna, Rosie O’Donnell, and most recently Jodi Foster, represent some of the more high profile cases of women  selfish enough to purposely deprive a child of the love of a father.  These women are all certainly capable of providing materially for their children, unlike the  countless cases of young women who have not planned their pregnancy, and whose boyfriends do not face up to their responsibilities.  The poverty that so often goes along with illegitimacy is not a concern for millionaires having illegitimate children, but there is ample reason for as much moral concern.  Unlike the Jodi Fosters of this world,  most single mothers do not anticipate the father’s abandonment of themselves and their children; they have not necessarily chosen knowingly to deprive their children of  fathers.  	     Children are born every day with birth defects and disabilities, and most are still lovingly received by their parents.  The child’s physical problems  rarely affect the love accorded by a  parent, but still there is not one parent alive who would willfully choose that fate for  a son or daughter.  Why is it any more justifiable to willfully burden a child with the potential emotional problems that so often are present in fatherless children?    We should recognize the choices of these women as embodying the crassest form of consumerism  (notice that it is not an option for women of average income).  The  very act of conception for these mothers is a taking from their child, placing the mother’s needs first.  Granted, not every child is born into the ideal circumstances of knowing two parents who conceived the child out of their love and commitment for one another, but this is usually not by design, and was always looked to as the ideal. 	      One need only look to the inner cities to see the devastating effects of  absentee fathers, though in this case, it is primarily the refusal of fathers to accept the consequences of their behavior.  Many of these young fathers unfortunately know that life guarantees no one the gift of a loving father, and they, like so many men, walk in the footsteps of their own fathers.  We ignore the fact that this is the central problem in these communities, where the dirge of opportunity can never be remedied without the every day presence and influence of  mothers and fathers, both of whom are necessary for the real education of children.       Perhaps the failure of so many fathers to love their children, and the mothers of those children, has led us as a society to shrug our shoulders when affluent single women reveal by their choices that fathers do not matter.  But for every father who has failed his son or daughter, there are thousands who, in the eyes of their children, are one of only two people in the world who can truly never be replaced. For this most recent father’s day, I offer my best wishes to all the men who know this to be true, and who treat their children to their unique love.   You’ll never have a more important job.

      The joy of June matched the elation of October - seeing the Lakers fall badly was as pleasurable as seeing the hated Yanks fall to the most successful post-season team in the history of baseball, the Florida Marlins.  And the losses of both were made all the sweeter by their prior heroic victories - in Game 7 for the Yanks against the Socks, and in Game 5 for the Lakers against the Spurs, when Fisher made that ridiculous 3 pointer.  After knocking off the Sox and the Spurs, respectively, surely the Marlins and the Pistons would be a walk in the park.  Not so.  And, in contrast to the Yanks, who I hate as a matter of principle, I had more personal reasons for hating the Lakers this year. Here are a few:       1) The Zen Master - I hate Phil Jackson. This guy has made a career out of coaching superstars who get nearly every call, and yet after any playoff loss he lays into the refs.  Even his new-agey nickname makes me sick.  It was great to seem him out-coached by Larry Brown.  We should have seen it coming - if Brown could squeak out even one win with the Sixers against the Lakers three years ago (when the Lakers were much better than they are today), the smart money would have been on a Pistons sweep, prevented only by Kobe's clutch 3-pointer in Game 2.      2) Karl Malone - I always liked Karl Malone ... until he signed with the Lakers.  Gave up all of that money, unselfishly we were told, in order to win a Championship.  Turns out he was overpaid.  Memo to Karl Malone: Mark Madsen won several championships with the Lakers - it didn't make him a champion.  It made him a lucky guy whose presence had no effect for good or ill on the Lakers season. You should have been content with the knowledge that the Jazz won two championships with you as their leader against the Bulls (factoring out the 10-point per game spot the refs gave Jordan in every game of the playoffs).  Joining the Lakers was equivalent to a general who lost a battle against a powerful foe resurfacing years later as an enlisted man looking for glory in the invasion of the Falklands.       3) Kobe Bryant - if I were accused of rape, and if I were beyond a doubt guilty of adultery against the Mother of my new born son, I wouldn't wear such a smug self-satisfying arrogant look on my face everytime I dunked a basketball.  Actually, if I ever dunked a basketball, I might wear a smug self-satisfying arrogant look on my face, no matter what I was guilty of. But that is beside the point - I still hate this guy. The only guy I like on the Lakers is Shaq, and that is mostly because it is obvious that he hates Kobe even more than me.         4) Gary Payton - I always liked Gary Payton ... until he signed with the Lakers.  Gave up all of that money, unselfishly we were told, in order to win a Championship.  Turns out he was overpaid.  Memo to Gary Payton: Mark Madsen won several championships with the Lakers - it didn't make him a champion.  It made him a lucky guy whose presence had no effect for good or ill on the Lakers season. You should have been content with the knowledge that the Sonics won a championship with you as their leader against the Bulls (factoring out the 10-point per game spot the refs gave Jordan in every game of the playoffs).  Joining the Lakers was equivalent to a general who lost a battle against a powerful foe resurfacing years later as an enlisted man looking for glory in the invasion of the Falklands.

               Did you know there is a wide body of academic literature concerning the psychology of political conservatives?  I kid you not; as I write, there is probably some professor up for tenure with a very weak publication record, and his saving grace will be that in one particular study he had the "courage" to harp on the psychological problems of Republicans, which is a very brave thing to do on college campuses.  If he wants to make the vote a cinch, he would be wise to show up at his tenure review in drag. You can't buy diversity like that on the faculty.           Curiously, even as the "couching" science has blossomed within the academy, the actual couching of conservatives in the public square has slowed considerably. At one time, scientists could openly couch conservatives. The most famous and thorough couching of all time took place prior to the 1964 election, when 1,189 psychiatrists declared Barry Goldwater mentally unstable and paranoid. One can assume that these psychiatrists presumed such attributes made Goldwater unfit for office.  None of these shrinks had met Goldwater, which provided them the added bonus of not being liable to a malpractice suit for their armchair diagnoses. Unfortunately, that same fact left Fact magazine, the public benefactor responsible for informing the voting public of Goldwater’s instability, liable for a libel suit from Barry himself, which he handily won. So much for freedom of the press, free speech, and the moral imperative of an informed electorate! (I’ll just bet that John Ashcroft has a picture of Goldwater in his office.)             The libel suit that stemmed from Barry’s couching may have had a chilling effect on scientific inquiry in the field, or at least on efforts to apply the science of couching to everyday paranoid conservative politicians. But I think there is a larger reason the practice fell out of favor. When 1,189 psychiatrists peered into the convoluted workings of Goldwater’s brain, conservatism was no threat to the ruling liberal orthodoxy. That of course has changed, and with it couching has taken a back seat to other political strategies, which consist principally of claiming that conservatives possess the IQ of amoebas, and that we don’t wear facial hair because we are only capable of growing Hitler mustaches, and that would reveal what we really think.              Liberals no longer have the luxury of couching conservatives in real time - it can only be done on a post-mortem basis. Indeed, in an environment where they have helped define virtue as chiefly consisting of the quality of having been a victim, the practice of couching may elicit sympathy for us conservatives as the victims of authoritarian fathers.  (Picture millions of Great Santinis raising little Young Republicans - the horror!)  We might even add to our plurality through the misplaced sympathy of liberal voters who hope that voting us in will help to cure us by allowing us to “grow” in office (and there is some precedence that such growth does happen).               So deeply entrenched is the more effective dual strategy of painting every conservative as Hitler with a lobotomy that you could probably bring on your own assault by randomly approaching a student at Cal Berkeley and stating that you think George W. Bush is a compassionate and intelligent politician. With your arms covering your ears in a feeble attempt to protect your head, you may not hear her grunting between blows: “Take that for the Patriot Act and that for Guantanamo Bay and that for Blood for Oil.”             But there is also a slim chance that you may be spared the beating of your life (and it’s probably not your first, due to the likelihood of your authoritarian upbringing) at the hands of our young pacifist coed, if she has been schooled in the science of couching conservatives. As a student at Berkeley, she may have chanced upon a course or two taught by either Jack Glaser or Frank Sulloway, two Berkeley professors that are very recent contributors to the science.  Glaser and Sulloway recently co-authored an article in the Psychological Bulletin along with John Jost of Stanford and Arie Kuglanski of the University of Maryland.  Apparently the complexity of the topic requires four co-authors.  We’ll call these guys the Four Freuds for simplicity.              The involvement of any Berkeley professor in this research area, let alone two, is worthy of note. That a man can walk the campus of Berkeley day in and day out for years, and each day arrive at his office thinking about the psychological oddities of conservatives is no small wonder.  Have these guys ever even seen a conservative outside of the occasional Connie Chung interview of some 70 year-old neo-Nazi who lives 200 miles from his nearest neighbor?  Paleontologists arguably have more first hand experience with live dinosaurs then a Berkeley professor is likely to have with conservatives.               And if these guys were faculty at Berkeley 35 years ago, they may have found themselves held at gunpoint by some of your average psychologically well-adjusted Berkeley students. That was when the quaint practice of our best and brightest students holding their college administrators hostage at gunpoint was in vogue.  These rational idealists would demand changes to the curriculum in exchange for the safe release of the administrators, and did so at Cornell and Yale, among others.  You might think that such happening would have spawned a psychology of the extreme left that sought to explain why some would risk lifelong incarceration in exchange for the promise of easier college classes.  But quite the opposite probably occurred.              Picture the scene: Glaser and Sulloway as human bargaining chips for the students’ demands to add a litany of courses that have as their common theme the corruption of all those stodgy institutions that have led to their receiving an advanced education free of charge. Glaser and Sulloway, in the five tense moments it takes for the administration to capitulate to the demands of the terrorists (and thank them for adding diversity to the curriculum) independently and simultaneously envision their next great research project. “I will establish the perverse psychological motives of conservatives!” A turning point in the history of science!  A few semesters later, they are co-teaching a course entitled “Conservatives - Still Crazy After All These Years”, listed proudly in the coursebook alongside other classics born that same day, such as “Marriage as Modern Slavery” and “How White Men Ruined the Utopian State of Nature.” Maybe Jost and Kuglanski were dilated-eyed Berkeley undergrads who happened to show up for Glaser and Sulloway’s lectures, and the rest is history.

      I sneaked across the street and picked up my neighbors Washington Post this Sunday.  I had a guilty feeling - not because I was stealing - my neighbors were on vacation and they asked us to grab their morning daily.  The guilt stems from my loyalty to the Washington Times, which is unabashadly conservative. The Post, and other like newspapers, hire 1 conservative columnist per 20 (roughly proportional ideological representation in the industry) and act like they are non-partisan.  Not so for the Times.  Three essays caught my gaze - two in the Style section and one in the Commentary - all dealt with Reagan.  For those Post readers (and writers and editors for that matter) left glum by the outpouring of effection for Ronald Reagan, the opinion page gave us the encouraging reminder of an historian from the University of Texas (apparently freedom of speech has returned to Texas now that Bush has larger fish to fry at the national level) that the final judgment of historians has yet to be made in regard to Reagan.  Similar outpourings of effection greeted the death of Warren G. Harding at the time of his death, despite what came to be his enduring legacy of scandal. Without any apparent sense of irony, the author continues to remind us that those students now entering college have no real personal remembrances of Reagan's times, and so how they will view the former president depends upon how the historians of the universities tell their little charges to think.    So there is hope.  Because historians are the only ones with a passionate and enduring interest in defining Reagan's legacy, and your everyday man on the street who lived through those times and regarded Reagan as a great president will move on to other interests, the readers of the Post can rest certain that Reagan will join Harding as a president whose post-mordum accolades were ill deserved and short-lived.  And the Style section provides a logical call to arms that follows from this opinion piece.  First, we are told of the fact that Reagan drew the ire of rock stars from Sting to the Dead Kennedy's, as well as most former members of the Eagles.  With the exception of LBJ, who had to deal with the anti-war counter-culture, no President has drawn as much ire from those who have made careers out of harnessing their teen-age angst into their old age (but we are told that Bush, if re-elected, may rival Reagan). Of course, Reagan always had the good sense to treat the counter-culture and its rock-n-roll descendents with all the seriousness they deserved, which is to say none.  Professional teen-agers can sometimes broach open disagreement, but if you ignore them entirely, you may end-up being the subject of their encore performance at the next Rockers for Pro-Choice rally.  Next, we are reminded by the members of the gay community, on the day following their annual display of pride on our national mall, that Reagan was silent in the face of the rising AIDS epidemic.  There is eveidence to refute that, of course, but why bother?  Instead, let us point out the propriety of judging a man's presidency according to his response to a disease that affected a small subset of an even smaller portion of the population.  Presumably, Reagan should have thrown billions of dollars into researching a cure that would make the bathhouses of San Francisco safe again for anonymous and promiscuous sex. Funds should have either been raised through higher taxes on traditional families, or through cutbacks to other social programs.  Like the rock stars, what hurt most was the fact that Reagan didn't seem to "feel their pain."   Reagan drew the ire of the music world and the gay community in much the same way fathers draw the ire of their sons - by not granting their emotionalism any degree of seriousness.  Indeed, it is said of Reagan that his relationship with his children was somewhat distant, although in their maturity each of his kids have come to realize that a father is not defined by the indulgences he grants his children.  Fortunately for the readers of the Post, rock stars and gay activists generally don't mature, and will cling to overwhelming importance of their own overwrought emotionalism.  They will never forgive Reagan - the distant father.  Now all that is needed is for gay rock stars to become prominent university historians, and the legacy of Reagan will be corrected for the ages.

      My four year old twin boys are very fond of Superheroes. To them, there can never be enough of them, and the current supply is found wanting. But they also realize that a Superhero needs a foe. So they make up their own superheros and foes, defined by three things: 1) a name; 2)whether he or not the aforementioned is a good guy or a bad guy; and 3) a modus operendi.  The MO doesn't always appear on the surface to serve the superhero in any real capacity, but in the imaginations of my boys, I am sure there is an underlying rationale to the skill set they endow their make-believe heros with.  "Steadyman", for example, is a good guy, and he can stay still for four weeks at a time.  It may not be clear what purpose that serves - the ability to stay physically still, but as a metaphor for sticking to right convictions, it is spot on.  A close metaphorical cousin of Steadyman must be Reaganman - a good guy - who never wavered in defense of freedom and in opposition to tyranny.  I'll teach my boys about Reaganman.

           Is the irony of the current 9-11 commission inquiry apparent to anyone but me?  Here we have a commission charged with determining exactly how we could have prevented the 9-11 attacks.  Now of course they are asking the question from an intelligence/military/defense standpoint, rather than saying - if we had only pulled our troops out of Saudi Arabia, left Israel to its own devices, converted to Islam (and not just plain vanilla Islam - the kind where we would swear to kill infidels).  That is good, of course.  So the question of the day is: what could we have done unilaterally, with the force at our disposal,  to prevent the 9-11 attacks from occurring?        The answer, if we follow the arguments against the Iraq war, is that whether or not it was feasible to do something, we had no right to do anything!  Sure, Osama had created a little trouble here and there, perhaps no more or no less than Saddam (even putting aside the first gulf war).  But had we pre-empted, wouldn't that just make us bullies, unwilling to heed the advice of the French?  Wouldn't such actions have led to easier recruitment efforts for the terrorist organizations?  Apparently we need to be devastatingly attacked before we merit any sympathy from France and others in our efforts to protect American citizens. And until we have such sympathy, we are supposed to just stand by and let a cancer grow.  I'm sure you see some difference here, but I guarantee you if Bush (and I wouldn't make the same claim about Clinton) had gone into Afganastan prior to 9-11 to wipe out a few terrorist camps, we would have been treated to daily pictures of moral idiots protesting with signs that portray Bush as Hitler.  And John Kerry, the French, the Germans, etc. would have been decrying the move right up until today.

      When Reagan left the White House, he left the White House.  No clinging to the scene.  No acting as kingmaker in the Republican Party.  No taking potshots at his successors. And when he left the White House, Bush Sr. didn’t have to re-order fine china and silverware.  Bush Sr. has followed largely the same course, and I am confident Bush Jr. will as well, but hopefully not for another four years.  What explains the fact that Clinton and Carter feel the need to wear out their welcome?  OK, admittedly, at least Clinton wore it out for me a long time ago, so I am not without partisan bias.  (Being all of eight years old when Carter took office, it took a little longer for me to be sickened by him.)  Carter’s greatest contribution to humanity was curing the “malaise” he had diagnosed his subjects with in the course of his dismal presidency by getting trounced in his re-election bid.  It’s an inadvertent contribution, but is no less praiseworthy for that fact.  Why not rest on his laurels and leave it at that?  Clinton’s greatest contribution was easing the workload for late night comedy writers, who are usually under great stress to produce decent material.  It puts him on par with O.J. Simpson, but you don’t see O.J. thinking that accomplishment worthy of having him in the public eye every second of the day.   Maybe the fact that these two guys cannot simply leave the scene is attributable to their comparative youth when they left office, but I think Bush Jr. will prove that thesis wrong.  But if I am wrong, and youth is the common denominator, then I would seriously consider voting for the older candidate, or the one of more frail health, if only so that (like Reagan) they can be gone when they leave.  I think the explanation really is quite simple.  Reagan and Bush know that the American people do not need them, which is a testament to their comparative humility.  It is pure hubris to think oneself the “indispensable” politician in this country, as some are no doubt prone.  And they have the class, wisdom, and requisite level of self-assurance to know that they themselves do not need the American people - they don’t need the validation of the chattering classes or of history.  They didn’t self-consciously fret over how history would one day view them, perhaps because they know the judgment of history is the judgment of man, and whether or good or bad, it is not the judgment that ultimately matters.    It was said of Bush Jr. during the 2000 election that, in contrast to Gore, he didn’t need the presidency – life would go on for him, whereas for Gore the loss would take a far greater toll.  Certainly the prediction for Gore now wrings true.  He needed the presidency, much as Clinton and Carter needed the presidency, and the latter, having had it, clearly became addicted to it.  There is something unseemly about the ego required to even aspire to the office, and the founding fathers used to routinely express disinterest in holding such power.  Even if only feigned, their protests at least recognized the dangers inherent to vesting power in the hands of a powerful ego.  Unseemly or not, the job has to be filled by someone.  What is far more disturbing is the ego that not only aspires to and attains the office, but hangs on to the scene as if all hope will be lost without its presence.  The self-justification is always that the country needs me, but the truer cause in the case of some is that they need the country.

       I am on vacation for the remainder of the week, so this will be the last for the week.&nbsp;   Linda Rondstadt has recently been run out of Vegas for her anti-Bush screeds and her tribute to Michael Moore.&nbsp; That tribute consists of dedicating the last song of her concert,  Desperado , to comrade, er, I mean, patriot Moore.&nbsp; Somehow that alone makes Eagles music less appealing for making out.&nbsp; But it gets even worse when you look at the lyrics and try to apply them to Moore.   Desperado, why don’t you come to your senses?    I like the question, but I would probably address it "*%$hole, why don't you...   You been out ridin’ fences for so long now   See what the sexual revolution has led to?&nbsp; Somewhere in Montana there are a bunch of ranchers busily fixing their fences and wondering why their buffalo count hasn't diminished, and why there is a discarded condom left&nbsp;exactly where the fence was broken.   Oh, you’re a hard one   With those 24-pack abs of yours.   I know that you got your reasons   Cheif among them your oversized ego, your love for fascist Arabs, and the fact that there are enough people on the looney left to make you millions by hawking conspiracy theories   These things that are pleasin’ you    Can hurt you somehow   If only it were so, and I can't say scenarios haven't run through my head.&nbsp;   Don’ you draw the queen of diamonds, boy    She’ll beat you if she’s able   Somebody ought to beat you, if it's the queen of diamonds, so be it.   You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet    Now it seems to me, some fine things     Have been laid upon your table   A full-rack of spare ribs, three Big Macs, a plateful of french fries, some pork rinds, a gallon of Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby ice-cream, half a dozen fried catfish ...   But you only want the ones that you can’t get   Say what?   Desperado, oh, you ain’t gettin’ no younger   You aint gettin no prettier either.   Your pain and your hunger, they’re drivin’ you home   Hunger?&nbsp; Is she dedicating this to the Michael Moore we all know and hate?&nbsp; And he might be in pain, but surely he could alleviate it by rubbing Preparation H all over his head.   And freedom, oh freedom well, that’s just some people talkin’   Yeah, like 25 million Iraqis   Your prison is walking through this world all alone   Walking alone?&nbsp; Isn't he usually walking a couple steps behind some poor guy he has chosen to hector for his day's amusement?&nbsp; I got another idea for a prison that would be suitable, but unfortunately Uday and Qusay are out of business, courtesy of Bush's Saudi puppet-masters.   Don’t your feet get cold in the winter time?    Of course they don't.&nbsp; I have never seen them, but by the power of induction, unless he has some strange affinity to liposuction exclusively for his feet, my guess is that those toes could melt a polar ice-cap.   The sky won’t snow and the sun won’t shine    It’s hard to tell the night time from the day   Especially since the Bush administration has been systematically trying to turn day into night, per the bidding of their Saudi puppet masters.&nbsp; Or is it their Jewish puppet masters?&nbsp; Gee, it's tough keeping up with the latest conspiracy theory!   You’re loosin’ all your highs and lows    Ain’t it funny how the feeling goes away?    The feeling is going away because all of your blood is rushing to your stomach (see fine things laid on your table)   Desperado, why don’t you come to your senses?     Come down from your fences, open the gate   But put your clothes back on, for God's sake!   It may be rainin’, but there’s a rainbow above you   Now here is a line that makes sense.&nbsp; As the sunlight breaks through the vapor of sweat that he exudes, the droplets of perspiration no doubt have a prismatic effect on the light waves; it happens to all celestial bodies that have water in their atmosphere, and a star in their solar system.   You better let somebody love you, before it’s too late   Give John Kerry a hug, you are prettier than John Edwards!

       In my grad school days, sometime after the lunchtime foosball tournament had come to its conclusion, and shortly after I would go back to my office and stare at some article that might as well have been written in Chinese, and following the nap I would take after going home because the Chinese script made me tired, I would sometimes, very rarely you understand, turn on the TV.&nbsp; (So much of an admission among the educated set is really rather a confession - not one grad school chum in my days of Minnesota would bring up a TV show in discussion without the preface - "I don't watch TV often, but the other night ..."&nbsp; I heard that expression so often that one day I even consulted (in great fear you understand)&nbsp;the grad school handbook to check if there was an explicit policy that habitual TV watchers would have their funding yanked.)&nbsp;   So there I would be, flipping through channels, and like a passerby attracted to a train wreck, I would invariably stop at Jerry Springer.&nbsp; Mouth agape in horror, mind racing through existential questions of meaning, eyes transfixed, there in solitude I would struggle with striking the&nbsp;correct emotional response to the carnival of human folly on display.&nbsp; Once the shock would pass, and I'd move on to other pursuits, the questions would creep back into my mind: how does he find these people?&nbsp; In what sewers do they dwell?&nbsp; How, in the most prosperous nation in the civilized world, does an entire class of barbarians manage to grow like a weed?&nbsp; Like my dissertation question, try as I&nbsp;did with all of the intellectual power I could muster, I could find no satisfactory answer.&nbsp; Until now.  You want to know how Jerry Springer does it?&nbsp; He directly subsidizes the creation of the underclass that serves as the actors on his stage:   CINCINNATI, July 22 (UPI) -- Talk show host Jerry Springer, a delegate at the National Democratic Convention, has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic causes, it was reported.&nbsp; Springer, a former Cincinnati mayor, has been a generous and vocal supporter of the Democratic party, with donations totaling at least $550,250, the Cincinnati Enquirer said Thursday after examining federal, state and city election reports since 1990.  Springer made 95 percent of the contributions since 1999, when he first considered running for U.S. Senate against Mike DeWine.    The controversial talk show host also has contributed his time to speak at fundraisers, paying his own expenses.&nbsp; Because of his generosity, Ohio House Minority Leader Chris Redfern, who led John Edwards' campaign in Ohio, rewarded Springer with an at-large John Edwards delegate slot at next week's National Democratic Convention.&nbsp; Edwards is slated to be the Democratic vice presidential nominee.&nbsp; Springer's support also earned him "Democrat of the Year" honors at the party's state dinner in May.

       A twist on an old joke applies equally to a new phenomenon: 95% of the population Googles itself, and the other 5% are liars.&nbsp; To that end, here are a few facts about my life that even I didn't know:  - I have written "a  urlLink dynamic story  that captures the essence of survival w/in an African American family in a Mississippi swamp."&nbsp; No easy feat for white guy who grew up in South Jersey!&nbsp; But there's more;  - I was one of the last larger than life characters in the  urlLink Yukon , until recently passing away;  - I am the founder and creator of the  urlLink Village Banking  method of poverty lending;  -&nbsp;If you don't like this particular blog, why not check out my other  urlLink blog , or a  urlLink third .  - Though some people scurrilously think that I got cut from the Freshman basketball team, how does your memory square with the fact that 1982-83, I scored over 20 ppg and had 11 rpg as the  urlLink 6'7" center  of St. Francis Xavier?  - In my spare time, I am the Kennan Professor Emeritus at UNC's school of public health, and you can check out a speech I delivered  urlLink here .  - But the way I pay the bills is as a  urlLink real estate agent  in Portland Oregon "who will speak openly to you, evaluate your needs, and address your questions and concerns."  Quite a busy life, wouldn't you agree?&nbsp; Others I am sure meet with&nbsp;more success, like my good&nbsp;friend Greg Sawka, whose poker skills recently netted him $15K, which, judging from this  urlLink picture ,&nbsp;he apparently squandered over the course of several months in the Nevada desert at $5 all-you-can-eat prime rib buffets.&nbsp; Greg, you should have visited my buddy Tom Metzger while you were out there; he lives in Vegas, and if memory serves he had no meetings of the  urlLink White Aryan Resistance  during your time in Vegas, so he would have been free.

       Stephen Hawking, the famous physicist, conceded a scientific bet placed with a physicist at MIT.&nbsp; The MIT physicist, it seems, bet that Hawking was wrong in his theory that a black whole in space destroys any matter that it consumes.&nbsp; Hawking is conceding the bet after working out an alternative theory to his original theory that concedes matter can be released from a black whole, and also contradicts his earlier theory, beloved of science fiction fans, that one could actually travel to another universe through a black whole.  That story got me thinking.&nbsp; Scientists are usually so sure about their own theories that they rarely, if ever, generate the theory that supplants their own.&nbsp; Instead, they tend to lock in to their conception of the problem, and have difficulty thinking about it critically.&nbsp; This explains the willingness of Hawking to place a bet against a prominent MIT physicist who was skeptical.&nbsp; Clearly that physicist's skepticism wasn't enough to prod Hawking back to the drawing board to rethink his theory, otherwise why would he have placed the bet?&nbsp; So what drew him back?  I have a theory on that, and it goes back to a photograph I saw long ago.&nbsp; At the time, as the following archived article reveals, I mocked the photograph.&nbsp; But now I think it explains why Hawking came to doubt his own theory.&nbsp; Here it is:  I recently had the pleasure of taking a tour of the West Wing of the White House.&nbsp; I suppose I was one of the lucky little people in the 1990s to catch glimpses of&nbsp; the location of so many decisions of import in the history of our nation without forking over thousands of cash sourced from the Chinese military to the Democratic National Committee.&nbsp; (Though my tight pockets may explain why I did not get any coffee.)&nbsp; The halls were filled with pictures of our president, first lady, and vice president, each warming the hearts of people the world over with their empathetic personalities.&nbsp; My tour mates and I were told that the president has his own photographical staff that is responsible for taking pictures of him wherever he treads, with the obvious exception of the closet that adjoins the oval office (however, maybe Starr just failed to consider the possibility that Clinton had it all videotaped, and maybe the president was being truthful when he said that he and that women were never alone together).&nbsp; It might be the case that most of the presidents have generally had the same, but I suspect none before have considered it one of the great perks of the presidency.  &nbsp;  My purpose in this article is not to beat up on Bill Clinton, lest I, for shame, be accused of being a Clinton-hater (to which the best response is simply: “What’s to like about him?”).&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead I turn my attention to his heir apparent, Algore.&nbsp; In the course of our tour, more than any other attraction that we were privy to, there was one picture prominently displayed in the hallways of the West Wing that particularly caught my attention.&nbsp; In contrast to most of the pictures, it was in black and white rather than color, as if to display the gravity of the discussion taking place among its subjects.&nbsp; It pictures Al Gore standing in front of an easel that holds a large pad of paper, pointing toward an equation displayed on the sheet, and looking at Stephen Hawking, who is trying earnestly to keep up with the lightning quick lecture being delivered by Algore.&nbsp; In the background, there are four or five of Gore’s lackies staring on with rapt attention, trying their best to feign that the conversation taking place is way over their Ivy-league educated heads.&nbsp; More striking than the obvious staging of what is intended to come across as a candid picture is the equation that Algore is trying to pound into the obtuse head of Stephen Hawking.&nbsp; For it is the equation that either gives away the lie of the picture or displays Algore’s ego in an all-too perfect manner.&nbsp; The equation – “x/y”.&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s it, right there!&nbsp; Apparently it requires explaining to Stephen Hawking.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If you take the view that the photo was purely staged, can you not picture Algore choosing that equation himself in haste as something he is sure any lowly peon touring the halls of the West Wing would never understand?&nbsp; If you can’t, it’s only because you have never watched him give a speech, where the would-be philosopher king Gore’s typical gameplan is to explain very complex minutae to you, the unwashed, in a style reminiscent of your kindergarten teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the photo was in fact staged, what it clearly shows is an arrogant fraud.&nbsp; And if it wasn’t staged, what on earth does Algore think that he can explain to Stephen Hawking with an equation as simple as x/y?&nbsp; Gore: “Now, Stephen, if we let x represent the size of my IQ, and y represent the number of steps that you will take in the remainder of your life, then the equation tends toward infinity, which is exactly what my research shows will happen to global temperatures if I cannot convince the ignorant masses that the Kyoto accords must be signed in order to limit greenhouse gases.”&nbsp; So either he is a fraud with a mild amount of cynicism and arrogance, or he is entirely sincere with an arrogance that knows no equal (OK, maybe Clinton displays equal arrogance).&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m not sure which is the case, but I know that neither makes me very comfortable.  &nbsp;  How this guy has gotten the reputation for being so intelligent is beyond me.&nbsp; He has certainly received kid-glove treatment from the press as VP in comparison to Dan Quayle, as he has had many gaffes along the lines of misspelling potatoe (I learned to spell from members of the NEA).&nbsp; Included among them are pointing out that a photograph of the earth pictures our planet upside down.&nbsp; I suppose his penchant for environmental issues gives him the ill-deserved aura of understanding the complexities of nature.&nbsp; But even if his “sky is falling” environmentalism is entirely backed up by all of the leading scientists in the field (it is not), it is entirely legitimate for voters to ask themselves whether they’d prefer to slowly burn to death in a soup of greenhouse gases or be saved from the coming inferno at the cost of having to listen to Algore talk to them like they are kindergarten students for the next eight years?&nbsp; Before casting a vote for this guy, I suggest you watch a speech he is delivering while sitting in scalding hot water so that you can make a truly informed decision.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Equally undeserved is Gore’s reputation as a man who, despite his closeness with Clinton, has managed to remain untainted by his boss.&nbsp; If we compartmentalize his sexual life away from his political, of course this claim is true, but other than Larry Flynt and Hugh Heffner, of whom could we say that it is not?&nbsp; The moral preening and crocodile tears empathy of Clinton for the “common” man, though curtailed somewhat in recent months (though by no means entirely), finds its logical successor in Algore.&nbsp; Can you imagine a politician courting the votes of tobacco farmers in an earlier run at the presidency by signalling himself out as probably the only candidate to actually farm tobacco, while in a later campaign shedding tears for his late sister at the 1996 Democrat’s National Convention because she died of lung cancer, at the evil hands of tobacco companies?&nbsp; It sounds like classic Clinton, but is in fact Algore.&nbsp; In the 1992 Convention, he was able to convert a horrible accident, wherein his son was run over by a car, into a speech that scored among the voters, and established Algore as just like us, despite being born with the silver spoon in his mouth.&nbsp; And thereby proving that there are silver linings, for him at least, to any tragedy that befalls members of his family.&nbsp; His speeches call to mind the old cartoon where a fat guy and a thin guy, stranded on a desert island, begin to hallucinate from hunger and exposure, and see each other as a hot dog and a hamburger.&nbsp; I wonder if his close relatives ever get the feeling when he looks at them that he is envisioning them as victims of gun manufacturers, environmental polluters, tobacco companies, or other groups perceived as evil and non-descript.  &nbsp;  The press has reported rumblings from among his campaign staff that they are all worried, right up to Gore himself, that Clinton will get us mired in Kosovo, and thereby jeopardize Gore’s election chances.&nbsp; And there is no doubt in my mind that Gore would consider this the greatest tragedy of Kosovo.&nbsp; In this Gore is the political soul mate of Bill Clinton.&nbsp; If either can do a service to this country by doing a service for themselves, then so much the better in their eyes.&nbsp; But if these two goals ever conflict, as they have many times during Clinton’s presidency (not to mention his draft dodging), we can take Gore’s callous concerns as an indication that, as with Clinton, he will do what is best for himself.&nbsp; It would be ironic if Clinton, whose primary concern now is historical reputation rather than political survival, pursues a course in Kosovo toward that end, and in so doing, hurts Gore’s chances.&nbsp; But for you liberals out there – do not despair – with enough contributions from Buddhist monks and the Chinese military, Algore shall overcome (and then he can deal with burning issues like campaign finance reform to remove the corruption from government).

      Don't you hate when you go to a library, and you "inadvertantly" remove books that you haven't officially checked out? It happens to me all of the time - somehow books seem to fall of the the shelf into my open bag, and off I go none the wiser.&nbsp; Sometimes they even find their way under my pant leg and into my socks.&nbsp; What makes it worse is that, once I am alerted to these things by the librarian who shows up at my door, she gives me a hard time when I immediately return everything I had except for a few documents that apparently I had accidentally discarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess&nbsp;I am&nbsp;not alone; similar things happen every day to good people:   urlLink CNN.com - Federal probe targets Clinton's national security adviser - Jul 20, 2004

      * I know that I linked to stories about this last week, but this more recent story builds a larger case against Honest Joe Wilson. Despite all of the vagueness that usually attends the "Bush is a liar" rhetoric, the "Iraq was trying to purchase uranium (for nukes) from Niger" is the one specific "lie" these people have clinged to from the get go. If you have any remaining doubts as to who the liars are, please read this article:  urlLink "A Little Literary Flair" .

      Speaking of liars, from what I've been told, Clinton's memoirs reflect a deep reservoir of memories related to nearly everyone who has crossed his path in his lifetime. Although I think that any claim that Bush is a liar was, until recently, woefully uncharitable, in the absence of evidence that clearly contradicts that charge, it was at least an opinion that could not be affirmitively and objectively disproved. That, of course, has changed, with the primary "Bush lie" blowing up in the face of the lying liar who told it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the charge that Bush is a liar is no longer merely uncharitable, it is a lie.&nbsp; (By pointing this out, of course, I am trying to chill free speech and quiet dissent.)  But hey, I am an admitted Clinton hater, and I'm sure I accused him of being a liar prior to having any definitive proof.&nbsp; So I have some sympathy for Bush haters.&nbsp;&nbsp; My proof, however, eventually came my way. Remember the lip-biting, index finger waving "I did not have improper relations with that woman." There was a chance that this was true in the Clintonian sense, which hinges upon the accepted definition of each word in the sentence. For example, this statement had a chance to be true if one defines "improper" in the same manner as his core constituency: a sexual relation is only improper if the male doesn't wear a condom, or if he wears a lambskin condom (PETA would object). But then the stain on the dress blew up even that defense of his honesty.   He has 900 plus pages of vivid memories from over 50 years; pity he  urlLink "could not recall"  so many memories closer to the surface.    urlLink

      The Great Depression is rightfully regarded as the bleakest period of peaceful time in our nation’s history, and yet for the liberal intellectual it was a time of newfound hope and opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edmund Wilson, one of the most prominent intellectuals of that era, captured the sentiments of his peers in finding the Great Depression&nbsp; years “not depressing but stimulating.&nbsp; One couldn’t help being exhilarated at the sudden, unexpected collapse of the stupid gigantic fraud.&nbsp; It gave us a new sense of freedom; and it gave us a new sense of power.”&nbsp; Wilson, along with Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, Erskine Caldwell, Jon Dos Passos, Lincoln Steffens, Malcolm Cowley, Sidney Hook, Clifton Fadiman and Upton Sinclair each supported the Communist candidate William Z. Foster in the election of 1932(6).&nbsp; The list was a virtual who’s who of American intellectuals at the time.  &nbsp;  The “stupid gigantic fraud” of free market capitalism had produced economic growth that was unprecedented in the history of the world, but in doing so it kept the importance of government in domestic affairs marginal at best, and frustrated the revolutionary and reformist dreams of the liberal intellectual.&nbsp; Rather than society laying its accolades upon the liberal intellectual, it was the businessmen - the small-minded Babbits risen from the lower middle classes – that were to be credited with the enormous success of the U.S. economy.&nbsp; A degree from Harvard was no automatic entry into this class, and may in fact have been a barrier.&nbsp; Free market capitalism, as such, was not hospitable to a caste system that was based upon intellect.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In that same era, the rise of communism in Eastern Europe presented intellectuals the almost criminally naïve hope of just such a caste system. &nbsp;To the liberal intellectual, the contrast between the workings of the U.S. economy and that of the Soviet Union could not have been more distressing.&nbsp; While a group of small-minded men were accruing enormous fortunes in transforming the U.S. economy by focusing upon the mind-numbing details of commerce, in Eastern Europe, it was the economic philosophers, steeped in their grand theories of history and human nature, who were determining the destinies of the millions in their charge.&nbsp; The liberal intellectual was all too keenly aware of which economic regime was more to his liking.&nbsp; His preference for the utopian rhetoric of the classless society over the dynamic freedom of free market capitalism made him blind to the atrocities and the abysmal record of communism, and he has still not recovered his sight.  &nbsp;  But the shameful record of Western liberal intellectuals in the Cold War is merely the manifestation, albeit the most important manifestation, of their hatred of free markets.&nbsp; What can explain their hatred for an economic system that led to unprecedented standards of living in their own backyards?&nbsp; How could such a hatred lead them to lie incessantly about the performance of the Soviet economy, to engage in traitorous behavior within their home countries, to become a propaganda tool of a hostile foreign government in the course of the Vietnam war?  &nbsp;  Free markets are reviled by intellectuals for two related reasons: 1) the resulting income distribution violates their sense of justice; and 2) the resulting distribution of power violates their sense of entitlement. [1] &nbsp; Taking it upon themselves to cure the first ill of free markets, they naturally cure the second.&nbsp; Government, as the natural monopoly of violence, has both the power and the ability to force its will onto unwilling parties, and therefore represents the only alternative to freely made decisions of individual citizens.&nbsp; The centralized decisions of government are much more susceptible to the utopian dreams of the liberal intellectual, either directly or indirectly, than are the dispersed decisions of their moral inferiors.&nbsp; The free market provides the intellectual a subject for criticism that establishes his moral superiority (via his alignment with those who do not fair well under a system dominated by free markets) and provides a pretense for making his own decisions the law of the land.  &nbsp;  This is the primary reason that intellectuals are liberals – the view that government should take a larger role in society goes hand in hand with the view that it is better to have extreme inequality in the distribution of power as opposed to income.&nbsp; And the bet is that the liberal intellectual stands to gain significantly in power and the status that accompanies it. &nbsp;Even those liberal intellectuals who do not actively seek such power nevertheless want it in the hands of like-minded intellectuals, as this in and of itself provides external validation of the status they feel should be accorded them as a group.

       Did you know that there is a nickname of derision for the weekend bicycler with legs proudly unshaved?&nbsp; (I am talking about the men, of course; there is no need to discuss derisive nicknames for women bikers with stubbly legs.)&nbsp; The would-be Lance Armstrong’s of the world call them “Freds.”&nbsp; For all I know, there is a whole other term for a Fred who doesn’t wear spandex.&nbsp; So there you have it – biking is a sport where men who do not wear spandex and do not shave their legs are ridiculed.&nbsp; As a sport, sadly it is not alone in this regard.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Take swimming, for example.&nbsp; When I was a lad life-guarding down the Jersey shore, our patrol’s representatives proudly eschewed the wearing of what we called “bird” suits in the swimming and rowing races held among the coastal towns in the county.&nbsp; You probably know these suits as speedos – glorified thongs for men that leave little to the imagination.&nbsp; I should admit up-front that our team sucked, and were routinely beaten by bird-suited individuals bringing glory to their teams.&nbsp; But we didn’t suck because we wore normal swim trunks.&nbsp; We just lacked talent.&nbsp; Now it is one thing to lack talent, and it is quite another to lack talent and be wearing a bird suit.&nbsp; That just makes you a French Canadian (for those unfamiliar, French Canadians vacation frequently at the Jersey shore, and always sport bird suits – reason enough, in my mind, for other Canadians to root for the Quebec separatists).  &nbsp;  My guess is that swimming has no term equivalent to the bicycling “Freds” and this is because it is almost universally the case that everyone who swims laps or enters into some type of race sports the bird suit.&nbsp; If you enter a race without a bird suit, the sight is so shocking to the other participants that it leaves them speechless.&nbsp; No sense making up a word of scorn given the rarity of the non-bird suit wearing swimmer.  &nbsp;  Now, I can understand that at least biking garb has some utility, and who am I to argue with guys who ride 2100 miles through the Alps and Pyrenees in three weeks time.&nbsp; But of course there are only about 150 guys who do that, and I am pretty sure none of them pass me on the bike trail, muttering “Fred” to me while clad in their US Postal-wannabe outfits.&nbsp; They may be faster than me, but that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t feel at home in Quebec.  &nbsp;  Maybe the individuality of swimming and biking drives grown men to wear such outfits.&nbsp; No team sport would admit of such competitive gear looking to exploit some thin competitive advantage, because it would take at least one guy on the team to propose such an idea, and he’d be teased mercilessly until he finally retired.&nbsp; I would bet that basketball players could play better in just their jock straps, but that is no reason to take off the uniforms and show everyone the comparative size of your naughty bits.  &nbsp;  These athletes have it so mixed up that even their teasing is upside down.&nbsp; Does calling another guy a “Fred” truly convey your contempt for them?&nbsp; If called out by that name, my first instinct would be to say: “Thanks!&nbsp; It is good to be recognized as a regular guy, a guy who likes to drink beer and watch football.”&nbsp; What guy named Fred doesn’t fall into that category?&nbsp; My reaction would be far different if someone called me “Trent” or&nbsp; “Dylan.”&nbsp; By that I would infer that he thinks I wax my legs, enjoy wearing spandex, and can sing at least three show tunes off the top of my head.&nbsp; Now that would be insulting, because I don’t wax my legs.

      * Tax the rich! The Bush tax cuts benefit the wealthy, right? So we can expect if and when Kerry gets elected, he (or at least his Sugar Momma) and trial lawyer extraordinaire John Edwards will see their tax bills rise precipitously, right?  urlLink Think again.  Maybe it is too much to ask one bleeding heart liberal super-millionaire to give away the vast portion of his/her fortune in order to live less like a hypocrite, but can't they just stop going out of their way to not pay taxes?   * Remember the lies Bush told about Iraq seeking to purchase uranium from Niger? Turns out, as usual, that there was plenty of lying going on, just not from  urlLink Bush.  Or you could read about it  urlLink here . But don't expect to see good old Joe Wilson making the major media rounds to explain his lies, as is pointed out  urlLink here . But in the eyes of some, particularly the person responsible for funding this web site (see the bottom of the linked page), Joe Wilson is the model of  urlLink honesty . Heck, if you defended Bill Clinton's honesty for so long, as so many Democrats have, it is easy to see how you lose some judgment in this area.   * I read yesterday that US troops are pulling out of Bosnia after nine years. Nine years stuck in that quagmire, which I remember all the networks fretting over at the time, and incessantly across these nine years, as another Vietnam (which makes it at least the third of five Vietnams we've had since Vietnam: Central America (Reagan), Iraq (Bush Sr.), Afghanistan and Iraq (Bush Jr.)).&nbsp;&nbsp; At least now we can expect all of the anti-Bosnia war demonstrations to come to an end.&nbsp; Anyway, do you remember all of the hand-wringing from the press following the initial "victory" there over our inability to find weapons of mass destruction ? Oh, sorry, my mistake, nobody ever tried to sell that war as one that involved any American security interest. It was just good old-fashioned American do-goodism, which was OK in the case of Milosevic for two reasons: 1) he didn't have the good taste to produce mass graves silently and slowly over the years, away from the camera's eye (see Saddam Hussein); 2) he lacked the ability to bribe every UN security council country in Europe with lucrative oil contracts that circumvented UN imposed sanctions (see, also, Saddam Hussein).  &nbsp; But at least in Bosnia we had the backing of the UN.&nbsp; Oh, wait a minute, we didn't have their backing, did we.&nbsp; But we did have France on our side, and that's what counts, right?&nbsp; That's what Kerry and Edwards mean when they say they want America to be respected in the world again.  *&nbsp;&nbsp; Against racial profiling?&nbsp; I bet you'd change your mind had you been on this  urlLink flight.

      Reproduced below for your reading pleasure is an exchange of e-mails with my liberal friend Victor, a grad school chum.  Prior to establishing my blog, he alone was subjected to my daily rants, which he responded to with patience and true grace.  The topic of debate at the time was whether or not Barry Bonds surpassing Willie Mays in the home run category was as legitimate as, say, MC Hammer (who was too ligit to quit, although he seems to be taking a hiatus of late).  As a debate, friends from Lehigh will be disappointed in comparison to the level of passion and lack of sobriety I once famously exhibited in debating one Sean McCormick at 4:00 in the morning on some train in Manhatten, wherein I established firmly and forever that Lenny Dykstra was superior to Barry Bonds. Even the bumbs on the train agreed with me.   Hatcher:  All right, here it is: Has Barry Bonds legitimately hit 661 home runs?  Or is he the product of steroids?  Here is my view: 1)  Nobody grows from the size he was in his first few years in the league to the size that he is now without roids. 2)  Nobody naturally or coincidentally makes friends, and keeps  as friends, guys who later go down on federal charges for illegal  distribution of steroids. 3)  Steroids make you irritable.  Barry Bonds is irritable. 4)  In Amerika, you are guilty until proven innocent,  especially  if you are black.  Barry Bonds is black.  In my book, Say Hey Willie still ranks third, and I rest my case!  Vic:  Actually, Willie ranks 2nd because Ruth never had to hit against  Satchel Paige and the rest of the great Negro League pitchers. Furthermore, nobody goes from hitting 11 and 29 home runs in 1918 and 1919 and then 54 and 59 in 1920 and 1921 (and hitting more home runs than 22 of the other entire teams in the league in 1920) without some type of assistance. Finally, I can only speak from personal experience here that looks can be deceiving. Lot's of people look at my physique and think that there is no way that I am not on the juice. But, in 100% honesty, this body is entirely natural, so I've got to give the same benefit of the doubt to Barry.  Hatcher:  Didn't know the history of Babe as well as you do.  I am not sure when  he converted from a pitcher to a regular player, but one would imagine there was a learning curve on the hitting end that could explain some ramp up in production, if not the levels he achieved.  Also, booze, greasy food, and women are permissible performance enhancing habits - these were the Babe's assistance.  I doubt that any steroids were even available back in those days; I think were still leeching the sick back in the 20s.  If Bonds gained his girth through the natural pursuit of vice, I'd be on his side!  But as far as I can tell, he doesn't drink, smoke, womanize, etc.  And he is supposed to be a role model?  But you bring up an excellent hypothetical question: what would Babe  have hit if he had to face the best of the Negro league pitchers?   First off, even if Satchel Paige were in the MLB, there would be a  50/50 shot he would have played in the National League rather than the  American.  So you'd have to look at expected home run effects of facing  any individual pitcher.  But what can we infer from the racial  distribution of Hall of Fame or Hall quality pitchers post-integration  about the comparative quality of black pitchers? And in considering  this question, I think you remove any Dominican pitchers from the mix,  because the timing of the influx of Dominican players is not related to  the timing of integration (although you could argue that because  baseball draws from a wider geographic population than at one time,  quality of pitching has increased - but remember, Bonds hasn't faced Pedro in his career).  Bob Gibson comes to mind as one of the greatest pitchers ever. Doc Gooden had a few good years.  But I can't think of many great black pitchers, maybe due to lack of knowledge.    Off the top of my head, here are some great white pitchers:Carlton, Seaver, Big Unit, Maddox, Clemens, Orel Hershiser, the Neikros, Nolan Ryan, Sandy Koufax, Ron Guidry, Mark "the Bird" Fidrich (OK - he's not great, but he was cool).  Who am I forgetting?  In any event, I think it is reasonable to argue that Ruth would not have hit 45 fewer home runes(6.2 percent of his total) in an integrated league, but it is debatable.   Vic: A surprisingly reasonable argument given the writer. In regards to Satchel, he pitched 3 scoreless innings for the A's in 1965 at the age of 59 and went 12-10 for the Browns in 1952 at the age of 46. Not too bad. It does make you wonder why the great cross-over players from the Negro Leagues tended to be hitters.  In regards to Ruth, should booze be considered a permissible performance enhancing habit if booze is constitutionally prohibited?  Back to the simply looking at the size of the player, pick up a Kirby Puckett rookie card: a bean pole who stole over 100 bases in his two minor league seasons. He hit 4 home runs in his first two major league seasons (1,248 at-bats) while batting roughly .300. In his third season (1986) he hit 31 home runs (good for 6th in the league) with roughly the same batting average. He was also much bigger. Steroids? So, I would suggest that the "Just look at him and his statistics" argument is not sufficient evidence and even in tandem with the BALCO thing can't be given much weight.  I would also say that while steroids and physical strength is a huge issue for, say, weight-lifting, in home-run hitting, it is only one relatively small piece of the home-run hitting puzzle. Otherwise, every team would just sign up Arnold or other body-builders.  Hatcher: In regard to booze and constitutional prohibitions, I refer you to a little essay by Henry David Thoreau - I think it is entitled  Civil Disobedience  or  On Civil Disobedience .  You might also read King's  Letter From a Birmingham Jail .  The only reason someone didn't write equally eloquent defenses of civil liberties in regard to the 19th amendment was because those inclined to do so were hopelessly drunk, as was their God-given (if not government given) right.  But drunks are people too!  As for Kirby, turning from a bean to a pear is hardly evidence of steroids, which may be your point.  And having that extra weight and strength in the hips will naturally give more power.  But much more suspect is a guy who has thin arms that suddenly look like those of the Incredible Hulk.  Finally, the argument that steroids have little effect in the sport is absurd.  Clearly the strength they provide is not a sufficient condition to hit home runs, but if added strength allows you 10 percent more bat speed without loss of hand-eye coordination, this implies that every ball you hit will come off the bat nearly 10 percent faster.  This makes routine fly balls to left field home runs.  If only we had complete video history of Hank, Babe, and Willie, we could see how many times a five percent addition to the distance of their ball would have led to home runs.  Anyway, Vic, I got to hand it to you: it is a measure of your fairness to give the guy the benefit of the doubt in a situation with imperfect information.  Baseball doesn't want to do anything serious about it - record breaking performances put people in the seats, whether they are legitimate or not.  Of course I blame the player's union for this.  But I also think the conduct of Bonds through this is partly indicative of his guilt.  He's said test me anytime, which is really an empty offer because he clearly has probably stopped using due to the scrutiny.  If we could go back in time - now that would be the test.  So why doesn't he, as the best player in the game and one of the best players all time, take a leadership position and buck the union and say that baseball should adopt a stringent standard? My guess is that he won't do that because he knows people in the game who know the truth about his own history, and they'll stay quiet to the extent that they may also be benefitting from similar usage. But if you piss some of the guys off with a statement that is hypocritical, the gloves might come off.

      The annual NAACP convention is taking place this week, and one of its leading lights, Kweise Mfume, is calling the black conservative Uncle Toms the inert portion of a ventriloquist act, with the "right-wing conservative media" playing the part of ventriloquist.  Good old Kweise, father of five children by five different women, taking people to task for their political thought crimes!  There is a name for a guy who doesn't take responsibility for his offspring, and then makes his living as the leader of an organization that propogates the myth that racism is the biggest problem for the black community (rather than the staggeringly high rate of illegitimate births among blacks) - con man. In any event, it put me in mind of one of the first Ideas Hatched articles, from the February 1999 issue.  Some of this is probably a little dated, but here it is anyway:    There exists today a growing minority within a minority.  The Congressional Black Caucus finds itself dealing with two Republicans - Gary Franks and J.C. Watts.  The head of the California Civil Rights Initiative, which intended to remove racial and gender quotas from government employment within the state, is a black man named Ward Connerly.  The most welcomed Supreme Court Justice in conservative circles since Scalia is Clarence Thomas.  And it is the Republican party, not the Democratic party, that boasts the presence of a black presidential candidate in the most recent election, with Alan Keyes throwing his hat into the ring. 	 A curios phenomenon, this!  The black leaders capturing headlines these days are increasingly identifying themselves as conservatives, and the phenomenon is not restricted exclusively to political circles.  In the realm of academia, which has traditionally fueled the most leftwing elements of the Democratic Party, the writings of  Shelby Steele, Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, and Glenn Loury could just as easily be those of William F. Buckley, Pat Buchanan, or Joe Sobran.    There seems to be a burgeoning diversity of opinion, regarding nearly everything political, within the African-American community.  And if the civil rights establishment stands for anything, they most assuredly stand for greater diversity - right?  Well, not exactly.  It seems the minority within the minority is not very well liked!  How can this be?  With all of the great strides we have made in increasing diversity in areas stretching from the composition of collegiate faculty right up to our immigration numbers, could it be that there is some form of diversity that does not promise to improve our lives and our society in leaps and bounds?    Is there a circumstance that justifies the other reindeers not letting Rudolph play in their reindeer games?  Shouldn’t we embrace our differences as the source of our strength?  Doesn’t more diversity improve our educational experience and, by extension, the substance of national political debate?  In the face of all of the proven benefits of diversity, surely anyone who opposes it does so out of racism or sexism.  To what else can we attribute such atavistic leanings?  But alas, diversity of opinion and viewpoint is apparently not necessarily to be valued, while diversity of skin color and gender are to remain sacrosanct.  But surely good liberals will respect the rights of the dissenting minority to voice their disagreements.  Or will they?  Michael Williams was an African-American member of the Bush administration who pushed for race-neutral scholarships.  Now, maybe he deserves to have his say, even if you believe the scholarships should be geared toward African-Americans. Spike Lee has a different idea of what should happen: Williams, in his eyes, is an Uncle Tom who deserves to be “dragged into the alley and beaten with a Louisville Slugger.”  Thank God for freedom of speech.  This minority within the minority must not wonder what it was like to live in the South in peak years of the Klan.  Ask Ward Connerly - death threats were not unusual in his efforts to pass the CCRI, and it is doubtful they would have been as prolific had he been white.  Those members of the hard-line Civil Rights establishment have become diversity merchants.  And in all their years of perfecting their trade, they have made few strides for the poorest inner city African-Americans. Sowell reviews evidence that suggests  affirmative action has had beneficent effects on the income streams of middle and upper class blacks, while it has not affected the incomes of the poor.  Charles Murray explains that the trend line for African American incomes prior to the institution of affirmative action programs would have put African Americans in the same position they hold today without one quota ever being made.  But this would not have allowed those who have become wealthy to do it in the style they’ve become accustomed to: by exploiting white guilt for personal gain.  This is much more fun then earning your money. Consider President Clinton’s  Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman.  After leaving the Carter administration, she started a consulting business that would help companies implement diversity programs that would allow them to smoothly adjust to affirmative action requirements.  The example of large-scale construction in Washington D.C. provides an excellent example of how she could help a company achieve this goal.  The city had in place a requirement that any government procurement process had to consider, as a criteria for selection, the representation of minorities in the management of private firms making bids.  Alexis Herman helped more than one firm secure contracts without being the low bidder by her expertise in making the company more racially diverse. It was as simple as making her a silent partner with a nice equity share in the company - good work, if you can get it.     All of these black conservatives threaten the possibility of more millionaires in the style of Miss Herman - but do they really threaten the situation for other, less well-connected, African-Americans?  The average back person on the street has no ties to the late Ron Brown and to other high ranking government officials that he can parlay into paychecks.  What does he have to lose in the replacement of the standard civil rights leaders with their conservative brethren?  To hear the standard civil rights reply, that reversal of power would be the loss of black leadership entirely. There is no such thing as a conservative brother.  As Roger Wilkins  puts it: “For black Americans who live in a society where racism exists, it is legitimate to set parameters. In arguing about how best to struggle, there is some political and intellectual behavior in which you engage that keeps you from being a black person.”  The color of your skin, then, is at least partially dependent upon whether or not your political views mesh with those of Mr. Wilkens and others.  The modern civil rights establishment is premised upon the belief that blacks, as a group, have a clearly defined set of interests which, when denied from within, makes one a traitor to his people.  The political embodiment of that notion is racial gerrymandering of districts: defining electoral districts so as to assure that blacks constitute a majority within certain districts, thus ensuring them the ability to be represented by blacks. When President Clinton originally nominated Lani Guinere for Attorney General, some of the criticisms for that pick centered upon her writings, which echoed the logic of racial redistricting, and suggested that blacks should have the right to veto legislation they find to be against their collective interests.  Dinesh D’Souza points out that not since John C. Calhoun, in the context of arguing for the South’s right to hold slaves, has anyone advanced the belief that a minority should have some veto power over legislation.  Even if we were sympathetic to the idea, it could only be implemented in a logically inconsistent manner.  Suppose that ten percent of all blacks are conservative - will ten percent of the racially defined districts be constructed so as to allow ten percent of the Congressional Black Caucus to be conservatives?  If blacks were to be given veto power as a minority, in deciding whether to invoke that power, would they grant the same power of veto over their decision to a dissenting minority of black conservatives?  These arguments are made under the assumption that the majority of blacks lie consistently on the same side of the political fence across a wide variety of issues.  In reality, the distinction is not so clear.  As a minority faction within Congress, black representatives have gone far to the left of the blacks they presumably represent.  In doing so, they have become a powerful minority coalition, trading support for more liberal measures in exchange for support on the issues they consider important.  Their power belies the notion that minority veto power is required at all.  It also suggests that to be truly representative of blacks, if they possessed that veto power, they would have to wield it in a way that would differ markedly from their current voting records.  Is Miss Guinere ready to grant that minority power to blacks, seventy percent of whom are opposed to abortion?  Perhaps she would grant the same veto power to women as an oppressed majority, and this would trump the majority decision of black Americans.  The ideas are so ludicrous when closely examined, but they point out the misplaced belief among black liberals that a consensus on issues across the board exists in the black community, is represented by current black leadership, and requires only a more concerted effort to consolidate the power necessary to implement their agenda.  There is no consensus, as black conservatives are quick to prove.  To artificially create one, black conservatives are no longer black.

      There are only two ways to watch a contest – either you’re fully vested in having one of the two (or multiple competitors) win, or you are indifferent.  Some prefer indifference, others cannot enjoy a game unless they are emotionally invested.  In either case, there is an age old tradition that enables anyone to be able to transform an event that they would not otherwise care about into one which they can watch with enjoyment: gambling.  For those who need to be indifferent, simply bet on the team that you are rooting against.  Likewise, if you are completely indifferent between two teams, you will quickly become both emotionally and monetarily invested in one simply by placing a wager.    I like to hedge my emotional favorite with a wager when I am motivated primarily by hate, so that I am indifferent to the outcome; thus, if I am rooting for the Marlins because I hate the Yankees, and have no particular affinity for the Marlins, I might hedge by betting the Yankees.  Only then can I safely watch the game.  But if I am motivated to root affirmatively for a team I love, I prefer not to hedge my emotions by betting on the opponent.  (There is a classic episode of Cheers where Sam bets against the Celtics, and is discovered for his betrayal – you don’t bet against a team you love because it is not good form to be happy when your fellow die-hard fans are low).  Which brings me to the presidential election.  I am trying to determine exactly how much I would have to bet on John Kerry to remain indifferent to the outcome.  I like Bush, but I don’t love him, or to put it another way, the degree of hate I feel for Kerry exceeds the love I feel for Bush, which means that I am looking for the emotional hedge – a bet on Kerry.  I fear that, should Kerry lose, in four years time I will be making the same calculation with Hillary, and in that event I am pretty sure that I will need a large second mortgage to place my bet.  That contingency, of course, limits the amount of my “indifference” bet – a Kerry win has the silver lining of delaying any Hillary candidacy until 2012 – when even all of the plastic surgery in the world will be insufficient for her to stay viable.    In the election of 1916 (Hughes vs. Wilson), which exhibited perhaps the highest volume of bets of any presidential election, the volume of betting (in 2002 dollars) was as high as $8.90 per vote cast in the election.  If you figure that only 1 in 100 voters were casting bets, this would put the average bet at close to $900.  Organized markets for such bets (such as financial exchanges and pools) have existed since the administration of Lincoln.  It was also not uncommon for people to make “freak bets” – where the loser would be required to literally eat crow or engage in similar embarrassing exploits; in the election of 1900, it was estimated that 1 in 30 voters engaged in such wagers.  Today, the  urlLink Iowa market  is the one legal betting market for presidential elections.  There, you can buy a contract that pays $95 if the candidate you bet wins. Right now, both Bush and Kerry contracts are selling for about $50, implying that the election is regarded as dead even.  And speaking of the dead, don’t forget to count on them voting heavily for Kerry in 2004, as they historically vote more Democratic than even African-Americans.  (There is a joke in New Orleans, where no one is buried in the ground, that this is to make it easier for them to get out and vote on election day).  And the dead, unlike elderly Jews in Florida, never vote for Pat Buchannan.  I trust the Iowa market over every poll, and the price of contracts on the day prior to the elections have even been more accurate predictions of the vote count than exit polls conducted on the day of the election.    The Iowa market is actually a bet on who will win the popular vote, so that the price for a contract is the predicted percentage of votes for a candidate.  If you bet Al Gore in 2000, you actually won in the Iowa market.  Now that would have been perfect – having your candidate win the election and still winning money on your hedge bet, but of course the opposite can occur as well.  As a public service, I should mention that I have a friend in Vegas who has the magic betting touch that only those in Vegas seem to have – whatever team he bets on invariably loses.  But he works this to his advantage in killing off teams he hates.  Remember the 2001 World Series, where Mariano Rivera came in to close out the Diamondbacks in the 9th inning of Game 7?  Mariano Rivera hadn’t given up so much as a foul ball in a decade, and he gives up two runs to lose the Series in the 9th.  At the time, you probably thought to yourself – nothing explains this.  Well, now you know, my friend bet the Yankees, and you have him to thank.  By the way, he is no fan of Kerry, so if you do plan to place your hedge bet on Kerry, I can funnel it through him.  But if your betting the emotional hedge on Bush, you are on your own.

      For my subscribers (who have subscribed by virtue of me knowing your e-mail address and being helpless to block e-mails): the "reply to all" button is a very delicate instrument, people.  The word "all" encompasses many people who are now daily questioning their association with me, and some who now actively seek to sever it. But more importantly, it has many disparate persons who are two degrees of separation removed from you, and who wish to remain that way.   The flurry of e-mails last Friday surpasses my daily requests to help out the Zambian "in charge of bills and foreign exchange remittance Department of GULF BANK PLC" who writes me at least twenty times a day "to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department."  It seems he has discovered "an unclaimed sum of ($21.5000 US Million Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our customer, who died in a plane crash with the entire family in year 2000", and "since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money." In any event, should I ever respond to Muhameed Idris in connection to this business opportunity, needless to say I will have enough money to quit my job and blog full time.  Lucky you.  But I also recognize the "Reply to All" serves as a nice forum for keeping a dialogue of inanity going between far flung friends and associates.  Therefore, I will send separate alert e-mails to different groups whose members have some affinity to each other.  That way, if you hit reply to all, at least everyone will know who you are, and they will blame you rather than me for clogging their e-mail.  Also remember that by clicking on the comment button beneath an entry, you can actually post a comment to the blog that can be read by millions each day.  Don't believe me?  Well, why don't you google "Ideas Hatched"?  I think I am 10th on the list, worthy of first page status.  Although on Friday when I checked I was ninth on the list, so I am falling fast.  Google it now. Surely with such high Google recognition, I must have many readers by now.

      Here is one from the archives, circa July 1999.  As true today as it was then; indeed I think this one is timeless:  Ahhh, summertime!  At last, it has arrived, and I can once again enjoy my favorite indulgences of our warmest season.  First on that list is the dusting off of my flip-flops for another season of service and comfort for my feet after nine long months of confinement.  Minnesotans always talk about cabin fever caused by the long winters, but if there is one body part that suffers from terminal cabin fever, in all months outside of summer, it is the foot.  But as they say, one never knows the pleasure of comfort so well as when it has been denied them for so long.  Summer affords one the opportunity to wear a whole range of open toed footwear, from flip flops to the Tevas, Birckenstocks, or the soccer style sandals.  While everyone has his own preferences, I can say with confidence that anyone choosing something other than the flip flop has no taste.  A presumptive remark, I know, but I make it only after serious thought and experience with the matter.    First among the advantages of the flip flop is its economy of material – there is simply no other way to attach a cushioned sole to the bottoms of your feet without using more material than that required by the flip flop.  I offer this as an advantage not because of any concern for wasting natural resources in shoe construction, but instead for the aesthetically pleasing simplicity of design that no other summer footwear can match.    Second among advantages is the complete lack of pretension embodied in the flip-flop.  Their price ranges from as little as $2 a pair to as much as $70 a pair, but there is no way to put on heirs by your choice.  No matter how much you spend, you will always be seen as being in league with those wearing the cheap ones. Though I typically have no complaint with a showy display of wealth, I note the irony that the liberal environmentalist peacefreak’s shoe of choice for summertime is typically the Birckenstock.  The Birckenstock is supposed to signal the liberal’s  simple lifestyle, his eschewing of material wealth, and his rebellion from the tight leather shoes required in the business world.  Yet he pays barely less for the Birckenstocks than the businessman invests in his Italian leather shoes.  The image that the shoe provides for its wearer actually commands a premium in price which makes it, quite laughably, an ostentatious purchase made only by those who are specifically trying to avoid one.  You’ll never see a poor person wearing Birckenstocks, but you’ll see plenty who are sensible enough to invest a couple of dollars in flip-flops.  A third set of advantages presented by the flip-flop consist in what it prevents you from doing.  In comparison to all other summer footwear, the flip-flop is unique in constraining its owner from the contemptible temptation to wear socks in conjunction with them.  The thingie, that little piece of material that attaches the sole to the upper flip-flop, and nestles in between the big and second toes, effectively prevents doing so.  (I made this word up.  Some people used to refer to it as a thong, but that word, along with others such as “is”, had its meaning destroyed in the course of the impeachment.)  In my mind, there is no greater sin to fashion.  Just as white is not an appropriate color for women in the time between Labor Day and Memorial Day, so to should the wearing of open-toed footwear be confined.  Fashion rules are of course often arbitrary and inexplicable, but this one just wrings of common sense, and I suspect that it is followed in all cultures.    A friend once purchased a pair of nice Timberland leather sandals, similar to the Teva design, but also having the thingie characteristic of flip-flops.  I expressed disappointment in his choice, as he was for many years a sensible flip-flop wearer.  He replied by saying that he could never wear socks with his Timberlands, and so he was in the spirit of the flop.  I might have let him off the hook after pointing this out, but he got greedy, and argued that his pair was superior because the heel strap allowed him to run more easily than he could in flip flops.  Which brings me to the second and more important great constraint offered by the flip flop: It prevents you from running anywhere.  If you want to run, put on running shoes.  Open-toed summer footwear is all about relaxing – running nowhere.  Those who are able to run in their inferior footwear may find themselves blistering, and could resort to, egads, socks, as a preventive measure.  A last advantage of the flip flop held over all but the soccer sandal is that you never have to bend over to put them on or take them off.  You simply step into or out of them.  No laces to tie.  No velcro straps to attach.  No buckles to secure.  In and out – its as simple as that.  If there is a disadvantage, it’s the emotional attachment that people tend to feel toward their flip-flops.  Others will leave behind their current pairs for the latest fashions long before the sandals have been rendered useless, but the flip-flop wearer is loyal.  He wears nothing other than his flops until that fateful day when the thingie eventually breaks.  Even Jimmy Buffet, musician and fellow flip-flop wearer, could only escape the sadness of blowing out his flip flop by firing up the booz in the blender for another margarita.  I suggest the margarita as your grieving ritual when you should blow out yours.  One thing is for sure, you’ll never blow it out in a season that is not perfect for an excuse to kick up your heels and enjoy one.

      *  Do you share with me the fantasy of going back to high school, knowing everything that you know now, and being a conservative wise-ass punk kid who ridicules your teachers and fellow students.  Then read  urlLink this .  It won't disappoint.  *   Here is a question to add to the racially biased SAT verbal section (I've added ebonics in paranthesis to make it a racially fair question - substitute for the italicized text)- Coach K, as a highly successful college coach,  would have been  (be) to the Lakers as:             a) Rick Pitino  was  (be) to the Celtics;             b) Larry Brown  was  (be) to the Pistons (or Sixers, Pacers, Clippers, etc.)  I know this is an easy one, but send me your thoughts.  *    ESPN has put forth Philadelphia as the  urlLink second most tortured  sports town.  Which beckons the question - who has it worse than us Philly fans?  Apparently we have to wait until next Tuesday to find out.  *    Jeopardy Answer: Sexual harrassment laws, the independent cousel statute, and campaign finance reform laws.      Jeopardy Question: Name three laws rammed down the throats of Americans by Democrats, who then wail and complain when such laws come back to bite them on the ass.    Remember - Clinton's impeachment was "just about sex"; actually it was about lying about sex in a sexual harrassment suit brought against him. And Kenneth Starr was a sexual McCarthyite whitch-hunter.  Now joining the ranks of laws that liberals consider to be appropriate if and only if applied to Republicans is campaign finance laws.  Apparently, a literal application of such laws would land Michael Moore in some deep trouble, and you can read about it  urlLink here .  Don't hold your breath waiting for the Bush administration to prosecute, but could you imagine the cries of censorship coming from the left if he did merely try to uphold the ill-chosen laws of the land.  *   The "two Americas" vice presidential candidate no doubt feels the pain of those who pay high health care costs and those who cannot afford insurance, but what is less obvious to us in the lumpen proletaiat is that Edwards and his trial lawyer buddies are a big reason those costs are so high.  The Health and Human Services department of the federal government estimates that reasonable limits on non-economic damages would reduce the amount of taxpayer's money the federal government spends on health care by up to $50.6 billion per year.  And this is just what the federal government would save in reduced Medicare, Medicaid, and other health benefit transfers.  It does not account for the larger percentage of the market that pays directly for health insurance.  Where does the $50.6+ billion go?  Well,  one-third percent  goes to John Edwards and others who bemoan our two Americas.  Heck, with those savings annualized, we'd have enough money to not only reconstruct Iraq, but we could also institute some good old fashioned regime change in Syria and Iran with money to spare.  *   Kim Jong-il, the leader of North Korea, recently shot 37 under par in a round of golf that featured 5 holes-in-one. But even with such obvious hyperbole from the benevolent Communist dictator, in the eyes of one  urlLink wag , poor Kim isn't quite in the same league of despicable golf cheats as Bill Clinton. I personally disagree, and how can you not given the comparative magnitude of cheating.  But the difference in the scale of cheating between a guy who tried to socialize 1/7th of our economy and another who has socialized everything in his gives whole new meaning to the saying that communists are just socialists in a hurry.   *   An absolute classic from  urlLink Lileks.

           In my Swedish research for yesterday's post, I came across this paragraph from P.J. O'Rourke (Eat the Rich):  "There are a few Swedish skinheads, who sometimes gather in numbers of about a hundred at the statue of King Carl XII in Stockholm's Kungstradgarden. They are regularly beaten up by about a thousand anti-fascist activists who then break store windows to protest the skinhead outrage."     I bring this up not to continue beating up on the poor Swedes, but to note that cultural inclinations stay in tact thousands of miles away and a hundred years removed.  Minnesota, as some of you may know, has a large Scandinavian-American population.  Having suffered many years in grad school at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, I witnessed a story very similar to the one PJ recounts from his visit to Sweden.     I think it was my second or third year of grad school when a white supremacist skinhead by the name of Tom David, an undergrad, decided to start a White Student Union.  For at least a year and a half, the Minnesota Daily, the school's rag, featured stories related to Mr. David and the anti-Davidians... uh, sorry, that rings too close to the whole Waco thing ... let's call them the anti-fascists, consistent with O'Rourke.     Although the coverage of the Daily and the reaction of the anti-fascists was decidedly alarmist, if there is one thing every liberal campus needs, it's the prospect of a significant white supremacist movement in its midst.  Nothing energizes the extreme left quite so much as the threat of a Nazi (at least a white one, as opposed to an Arab one).  And the presence of one that walks right into town, as opposed to hiding in a rural militia 200 miles from his nearest neighbor, is a downright boon to those right thinking individuals who think themselves quite morally distinguished by their opposition to skinheads.  No doubt the Women's Studies Department and the African-American Studies Department saw significant increases to their funding, on the premise that the "education" provided by such deparatments was necessary to combat the impending Nazi menace on campus.  Which is at least somewhat odd, since white women were not a priori excluded from joining Tom David's group.  In any event, there is probably two chaired professorships within these departments that should be named the Tom David Professor of blah blah blah.       How bad was the White Student Union?  Tom David stood about 5'3", and probably weighed no more than 115 pounds.  But what of his followers? Here, I should note that after having applied to be a registered student group (in order to get a share of student fees that go to student-based organizations), the White Student Union was rejected due to lack of significant membership.  It seems that a student group must have at least three members to be so recognized, and Mr. David had only one other friend.  Two white supremacists on a campus of 30,000 students, but given the hysteria, you would have thought that Coffman Union (the student center) was about to become America's Reichstag.      In any event, one day on campus there were flyers put up in the stealth of night announcing the date, time (evening), and place (outside Coffman Union) for a rally of those who support the White Student Union.  The obligatory counter-rally rally was then advertised widely, setting the stage for Minnesota's very own version of 100 skinheads being pummeled by a thousand anti-fascist activists.  Except this is Minnesota, which has fewer Swedes than Sweden, and therefore the numbers were smaller.      About 100 anti-fascists gathered outside Coffman Union spoiling for a fight.  They ate their vegatarian meals to energize themselves for peaceful non-violent protest, but of course once the blood started pumping in their veins and their heart rates rose, all adherence to the pascifist ethic passed through their system as quick as their tofu salads.  Waiting patiently to take on the fascist menace, they were no doubt deeply disappointed to find that there didn't seem to be anybody who supported the White Student Union.      At about the time they were about to give up, some poor unsuspecting white guy, with his girlfriend, came strolling over a foot bridge that spans from the main quad of the campus, over Washington Ave., and onto the grounds of Coffman Union.  He had the misfortune of wearing black leather and a short haircut, and was immediately labeled by the mob as a skinhead.  It must have pained some of the professors who taught the students in the mob to see their students judging a person by their looks, and not valuing the diversity that such people bring to the campus environment.  But, in any event, the mob moved toward the token skinhead, and proceeded to beat him silly.     Now here is where the Daily earned its shining moment in the sun, basking in the glory of what every journalist seeks - self-sacrifice in order to preserve the freedom of the press. It seems that there were Daily reporters there, cameras in hand, vigorously taking pictures of the melee.  When the misunderstood skinhead pressed charges against his compassionate debators, the police sought evidence that would allow them to identify said assailants.  Ergo, the police sought to obtain the Daily's photos, which the Daily chose not to publish, and the lonely fight of the Daily's student editor to preserve the first ammendment was on!  This was pure heaven for the Daily - they even got take on the Pigs! like their parents did in the Sixtees.  If there is one thing better than covering the news, it is being the news!     Of course the argument put forward by the Daily, though I am sketchy on the details, was something like if people knew the presence of the paper at a rally might later incriminate them, they might not be inclined to engage in criminal activity.  And a rally with no criminal activity doesn't sell a whole lot of papers.  Of course, had the skinhead managed to get a good lick in one of his attackers, the Daily would have raced it into print, and cooperated full-scale with the police.  This would only be consistent with the moral pecking order that characterizes the left: prosecuting and/or persecuting skinheads is a higher moral priority than freedom of the press, which is a higher moral priority than prosecuting anti-fascists.     So you see, you can take the Swede out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the Swede.

         I owed you one last peon to hate, having taken last Friday off to get an early start on the holiday weekend.  I thought about an entry dedicated to hating Jimmy Carter, but nixed it at the last second.  It's not that I think him worthy of one of only five entries; instead, I worry that people forget that they should hate him, and my entry would have merely been a public service.  It's kind of like when the Dallas Cowboys were 1-15, and you thought they were too pathetic to merit celebrating their low state.  A couple years later they were winning Super Bowls.  Not that Carter will ever be back in the sense of regaining the presidency, but he did win the Nobel peace prize, and people are starting to rethink their position on him.  It's a mistake, but I'll save my reasons for another day.  On to the more pressing concern: Volvos.     I hate Volvos.  I also hate Sweden, where Volvos are made.  Sweden is the one place in the world where socialism hasn't led to utter and complete collapse of the economy, along with the usual amount of political oppression.  But I suspect it has more to do with the Scandanavian culture than the economic system.  A Swedish economist once remarked to Milton Friedman that in Sweden there is no poverty, and Friedman replied that in America it is also true that there is no poverty among Scandinavians.  A perfect comeback.     You have to understand a little bit about Sweden to understand the Volvo.  The culture and economy are driven by an inordinate sense of egalatarianism, and it is bad form for there to be significant differences in wealth or income between citizens. This is why a person driving a 1994 Volvo station wagon looks no different than a person driving a 2004 Volvo station wagon - there haven't been any design changes in at least 10 years.  God forbid that it be obvious that I have a shiney new Volvo, and yours still has an 8-track player.        Did you know that fully 25 percent of U.S. automobile costs stem from frequent changes in the design of the models?  Here is a company, Volvo, that has only very recently discovered a design feature and technology that has been prevelant in the auto industry for decades - the ability to curve the elements of the car's body.  For the first time (ever?) you can buy a Volvo that does not look like a box, although you can still buy the box.  Given how little is spent on design, you would think that the Volvo would cost only 75 percent as much as comparable vehicles.  That would be the American "Wal-mart" way, after all - pass the savings onto the customer and earn your profits through volume volume volume.  That is exactly what Wal-Mart does, by the way, and aside from Halliburton, it has earned them the enmity of all Volvo-driving Americans, which is to say rich American liberals.     Because of course everyone knows that only liberals drive Volvos in America.  And the Volvo in America is really a status symbol - it screams out "I am a rich liberal.  I may vote Democrat along with the UAW, but I would never dare buy an American car, because that is so jingoistic!"  At the same time, the rich liberal would never buy a car made by crass capitalists, so other foreign made cars are out of the question, as production no doubt involved some exploitation of labor (and the exploitation goes far beyond not registering your live-in-maid with Social Security, which is really a very minor infraction).  Park yourself outside a tony private school in Washington D.C. (there are many), and I'd bet you'd see at least half of the kids being dropped off by a parent driving a Volvo, who no doubt fully supports the public schools for  other people's kids .  The Volvo in America is the outermost symbol of liberal hypocrisy.      Are the Swedes to blame for this?  Perhaps not.  But there is plenty of reason to hate them nonetheless. Here are a few facts about the Swedish culture that you probably didn't know:     -  Despite having a fully sponsored and subsidized state religion (Lutheran), church attendance is about 5%;     -  The state's schools and public services depict the few women who shun work to raise kids as "parasites."     -  Sweden has the world's lowest marriage rates, one-half of births are now out of wedlock, and one-half of marriages end in divorce.     -  Their teenagers boast the world's highest teen suicide rate.     This is what America would look like if the Volvo-driving liberals ever had their way.

         Let me say right off the bat that I hate people who say "it's a crime that professional athletes are paid millions per year while teachers earn less than janitors."  There are so many ways to attack such a statement that I feel it unnecessary; why is it my responsibility to rescue such people from the prison of their own stupidity?  That said, I will say that in part such people underestimate the value of prominent professional athletes in giving us regular Joes a harmless outlet for our irrational hatreds.  I'd pay them a teacher's salary just for that service alone.  In that spirit, here is a list of: 1) the athletes I hate; 2) athletes I should hate but don't; 3) athletes I try desparately to hate but can't; and 3) athletes I once hated but came to love.     In the first category, for the exact same reason I hate Karl Malone and Gary Payton (see "Pay Thanks to the Sports Gods"), Alex Rodriguiz (A-Rod) heads the list. If the Yankees win the Series, I hope they do it while A-Rod goes 0-50 in the playoffs, so it will be made obvious that they could do it with the rest of their overpaid players, and that he was just a really expensive insurance policy purchased by Steinbrenner.  In basketball, of course Kobe heads the list.  In football, Jeremy Shockey was near the top until he questioned the sexuality of the Big Tuna, which was way too funny.  Now he ranks among my favorites, even though he plays for the hated Giants.  Michael Irvin, though he no longer plays, ranks probably as the player I have hated more than any other.  His one redeeming quality was showing up at press conferences in those ridiculously loud suits with the bowler hat; at the time the bowler added to my hatred, but now that I look back I can't deny that it was really cool.       The two players I should hate but don't are Allen Iverson and Pete Rose.  If they were any other team, I would have despised them.  With Rose, I in fact did despise him until he became a Phillie and got us over the World Series hump in 1980.  Iverson may not be a life-long Sixer, but I stay loyal to even the ex-Philly players, even when they want out (like Charles Barkeley).  I can see why Democrats clinged to Clinton through his tawdry scandals, defending him at all costs - he was a rogue, but he was on their team.      Derek Jeter is an athlete I try desparately to hate but can't.  In fact, I can say the same of nearly every Yankee from those World Series teams.  I hate the team, but the players were largely classy people, and as hard as I try, I can't blame them for Steinbrenner trying to buy a World Series every year.  Compare them to, say, the 1986 Mets - now there is a team that I could hate down to every player (with the exception of Lenny Dykstra, as he later made ammends by playing awesome baseball for the Phils).         Larry Bird I once hated with all of the energy I could muster, but the guy is so ugly, you have to eventually learn to love him.  Contrast him with Magic Johnson, who you liked even when he was beating up the Sixers with a smile on his face.  His trajectory is a little different - once he was diagnosed with HIV, all of a sudden he became this new-agey "victim-hero."  Being treated with more respect by the media after that went down wasn't his fault - it says more about the media than about him.  But it did sour me on the guy.  Maybe if he had made a statement like the boxer Tommy Morrison - I made my bed and now I have to lay in it, I would have had some more respect for him.  But instead he treated it like he innocently caught the flu.  In that he may not be much different from most who have the disease, and many who have it, including him, may bear it with admirable dignity, but the innocent victim role is a little hard for me to swallow.       I also once hated Scottie Pippen, but a few things brought me around.  As with Bird, his ugliness worked to his advantage over the years, but what turned me into a Scottie fan was when it became obvious he hated Phil Jackson.  I remember him saying something about him never reading any of the books Phil gave him as his zen master - priceless!  Zen didn't win those championships, it was Michael, Scottie, some good role players, and three guys in striped shirts with whistles!        There is one current exception to the "if you are really ugly, I will eventually let up" rule: Bill Walton.  The fact that this guy was an academic all-American at UCLA speaks to the fact that everyone in college at that time was at least slightly more stoned than him. Ahh, but who knows, maybe I am just jealous of him?

      A few thoughts on Governor McGreevey:  1) We at the vast right-wing conspiracy thought this guy was totally incorruptible.  In our project "A Lewinsky in Every Governor's Mansion" (Legman for short), we sent at least a dozen thong-wearing, beret-donning weight-watchers his way with a pizza to deliver, and nary a one of them required any dry cleaning when they returned to our headquarters.  Who knew that we should have been sending him a Stephanopolis?    2) This is actually the one national news story that does not come as a shock to me - it is totally consistent with the story that broke years ago in the Total Soreness Gym, owned and operated by a New Jersey State trooper. The story was relayed to me by my brother Lime, who heard it after throwing up and passing out at the gym.  The troopers were responsible for McGreevey's security, which is no easy task for a guy prone to extra-marital homosexual affairs.  Did trooper training include learning how to lecture incoming Governors on how to have safe sex?  Enquiring minds want to know.  And is this the new media feed chain - Total Soreness to Drudge to the blogosphere to Fox and then finally to the majors?  3) "The truth about me is that I am a gay American."  Gee, thanks for telling us the truth.  I am sure your wife and kids appreciate the timing of your admirable honesty, not to mention the residents of New Jersey.  The Human Rights Campaign might consider your admission courageous (they said so), but excuse me if I think otherwise.  There will be those who will rush to defend you - oh, what a difficult burden you've lived with (or rather, what a difficult burden that society has forced upon you), but the truth is that you are the least of the victims here.  Your wife and kids deserve someone better than you. The voters of New Jersey - at least the majority of them - do deserve you: you are actually a step up from Robert Toricelli on the scandal-meter.  4)  But nowadays, regrettably, I fear that being gay will (in the eyes of many) provide this guy some degree of exoneration.  Spare me, please.  If a straight guy leaves his wife and kids for a hair-dresser, can he have a press conference and announce that the truth about him is that he likes his women younger and more attractive?  Maybe I am setting up a straw man here, and no one will really come to his defense - I hope that is the case.  But I have reason to doubt that it will be - remember that Episcopal priest who became the first openly gay bishop in that denomination last year?  Did you know that he was married at one time and had a couple of kids, and left them because the truth about him was that he was a gay American.  One would think such a past of betrayal would be enough to not pick that guy to lead a spiritual flock, but my bet is that you didn't even hear that little tidbit in all the press coverage of that appointment.

      Stax replies:  "Who am I? I am the inner ^&%^ Hatch er  coming out of the closet as a libertarian asking all to vote Libertarian or with principle during the next election. Bush and Kerry are the fast food hamburgers of political choice. They are the McPoliticos. Super-sized. I prefer the healthier organic breed of politican. Ones who aren't politicans at all. I want servants of the people as opposed to high cholesterol-mad cow laden-drooling villiage idiots serving as our lordes.  ^%@&amp; Hatch er  closes with: "In the meantime, I'm voting against John Kerry." He leaves us hanging unknowing whether or not he'll vote for principle.This even though he precedes his closing quote with a great solution: "don't tell us whose running. When we show up in the voting booth, hand us a brochure that has the platform of the previously undisclosed candidates, and let the chips fall where they may."  Wonderful solution. And I in fact won't tell you who Stax is in the same spirit. I'll instead swear that I'm in fact the inner *&#$ Hatch er  until he fesses up and indicates why we shouldn't vote Libertarian based on principle versus tribal allegiance."   OK, Stax, international man of mystery and intrigue, you left me hanging until late in the day before commenting obliquely on your identity, so I left you hanging for a day as well. But now I return to your challenge. In my own convoluted way, that last line - that I plan to vote against Kerry - implied that I planned to vote for Bush. To me, a vote for the libertarian would give more benefit to Kerry than the libertarian. So, despite the fact that I  might  actually prefer the libertarian to Bush, I think that I can still vote for Bush and be consistent with my preferences, if not my principles. And its a principled decision to the extent that my principles include not wanting a gold-digging Massachusetts windbag to be the Commander in Chief.  I'm sure that cleared up nothing. But if Stax is clinging to his comment that he is the inner me, just busting to get out and vote my true conscience, I can tell you confidently that he is not the inner me. I know this for two reasons: 1) the wonderful anti-psychotic drugs I take regularly to suppress the many inner mes that would otherwise post comments to the blog all day long; and 2) if the inner me were posting comments, it would go by the pseudonym MilkShake.  But part of the mystery surrounding Stax has been solved by the Hatcher, allaying the lion-share of my curiosity. Stax, you've outwitted yourself, because I know that you know something about me that you wouldn't know unless you knew me. You used my real name in your comment. A definite no-no, and not quite feasible for a libertarian who doesn't already know me. Sure, anyone who could drool with enough force over the keyboard could probably string together a few personal revelations from the entries and do some supplemental internet research to identify my true identity. But snooping into the background of an anonymous blogger is not exactly the modus operendi of a libertarian. Case solved! You're clever, Stax, but you got cocky.  I've redacted, obducted, and subtracted all reference to my name in your comment. You should have guessed that I am an under-cover operative of the vast right-wing conspiracy, and the release of such information could very well put me in danger. I'll let it slide this time. I still am a bit curious as to your true identity, but now that I know that you are either a direct involuntary subscriber or an affiliate of the same, I'm less intrigued. The remaining curiosity stems from the fact I can't think of one involuntary subscriber who would lean to libertarianism (OK, Bachenson, you accepted). I know some liberals, and some libertines, but not any libertarians.

      The Olympics haven't even started yet and I am already not watching them. I probably have never had less interest in the Olympics than I do this year. NBC has finally beaten it into my head that they don't give a rip about actually showing any sporting events; they just want to show footage of some obsessed mother and father waking their anorexic 12 year old daughter up at four in the morning to go to a gymnastics practice run by some Romanian pedophile. That way you can see the human drama of the whole situation.  You know what they say - behind every great teen-age athlete there is some truly sick parent who swares up and down on camera that little Suzie-Q insisted on three-a-day practices from the time she was two.  And you can just bet that Bob Costas has his fingers crossed for his Jim McKay moment, when disaster may actually strike the Olympic village. Being the live reporter on such a scene is like a golfer winning the Masters - like Jim McKay, Costas could count on being disconnected from the life support system 4o years down the road to come back for his once-every-four-year retrospective on the tragedy of the 2004 Athens Games, and always with that annoying trumpet music playing in the background.  Lacking such drama, Bob Costas will no doubt suffer the fate of Jim Lampley.  Not that the sporting events are that much better. I like the track&field and the swimming, but you just have to cross your fingers that the events you want to watch aren't concurrent with rhythmic gymnastics or synchronized swimming. But the one sport I haven't cared to watch in years is Olympic basketball, at least since 1988, prior to the original Dream Team. Why watch an event where the outcome is predetermined? Oh sure, the argument at the time was that our college guys could no longer compete at the international level, and so to bring the glory of gold back to the USA we needed to send the best. One problem with that strategy - there is no upside - if the Dream Team loses, the loss ranks among the most historic upsets in Sports history, and if it wins, so what? So what if we send a college contingent, we may not win every four years, but when we would win, and we would on occasion, at least there would be some sense of accomplishment.  Look at the USA hockey team of 1980 - obviously the stuff of movies - and ask yourself if that one victory, with a group of college guys, was worth more than all of the Dream Team gold medals combined.  I may just be bitter because the one suggestion I had been making for years to increase interest in Olympic basketball has gone largely ignored. I was all for keeping the Dream Team, with one exception. My idea was to troll the country for a fat sub 5' 6" basketball player with real charisma, a guy who never rose above high school hoops, but remains a gym rat of sorts and lives on a diet of pure junk food. I'd want him to talk an enormous amount of trash loud enough for the camera microphones to pick up, but have no game to back it up at all. Take that guy, give him a uniform, and see that he gets at least ten minutes of playing time per game. And don't put it all at the end, otherwise no one will tune in until the 4th quarter (kind of like with any NBA game).  No way a guy like that would have meant defeat for those early dream teams. The stunt would be highly entertaining, and much in line with the proud tradition of American arrogance - see, we can beat your basketball team with an overfed Spike Lee - now imagine what our military would do to yours.  Sure, I've never written the idea down before, but I have mentioned it to a few people, and by now the US Olympic Committee has no doubt heard some variant of the idea - but still we get fed the same diet of NBA stars, minus those attending to pressing legal matters. The idea has only gotten better with time - today NBC could build a hole reality TV show around the search for the player, kind of like the apprentice, with Larry Brown ending each show saying to one would-be-Olympian - "You're Cut."  Or maybe it hasn't gotten better with time, since now there is a real probability that whatever team we send may still get beat, as hard as that is to imagine. The excuses have already started - the NBA season is so long, these guys don't play together long enough, the lane looks funny, the shot clock is longer in international play, the three-point line is easier, gyros don't sit well with American players, how can NBA players be expected to pass more than once per possession, how can American players defend against teams that pass more than once per possession, etc. etc. Stick my gym rat on that team and they would just point to him as another excuse for losing.  So now I offer my second viewer-friendly idea for the US Olympic Committee. Two words - Harlem Globetrotters. Even if they lose, and they rarely do, at least we know some crappy international referee (perhaps the son of one who gave the '72 Olympic medal to the Russkies) will get a full bucket of water thrown on them. Or maybe it will just be confetti - you never know with the Globetrotters - they keep you is suspense!  You want to talk about passing - these guys have been running the weave for close to a century. These guys rarely lose, and they usually play against teams dominated by white guys (if my memory serves me correctly here), so they are perfect for international competition. A funny looking lane doesn't matter to them. They'll probably wait until during the game to have gyros delivered right to the court. They don't care about the three point line - they've always preferred to take hookshots from half-court anyway. They protect the ball well on offense, using their shirts to great effect. And if the game gets out of hand - one of them usually has a whistle stuffed in his shorts that he can bring out to commence officiating and confuse the opponent.  You think NBA players don't know the international game? They'd be regular Einsteins in comparison to the international players trying to understand the Globetrotter's game.

      Two comments from Stax, the most recent one exhorting me to check out the libertarian candidate for President, Mike Badnarik. I know a Heavy-T, a Giant, a Boz, a Moshe, a Mog, a Lime, the Cheetah, a T-Bob, a T-Cal, a Dusty Eggs, a G-No-Money, a BFX, and a Head, but I don't think I know a Stax.  Could it be that the Hatcher has attracted a regular reader through the mind-boggling randomness of the internet? Have I managed to snare, and keep caught in my web of unsupported and poorly worded opinions, someone outside the list of involuntary subscribers? Is it possible that there others out there, less willing to out themselves by posting a comment, as voluntray readers of Ideas Hatched ?  Or is it that Stax is a pseudonym for someone on my list? Fess up, Stax. I gots to know. If I don't know you, I must say right off that my opinion of you could not be higher, and I would be more than willing if necessary to even bump off one of my so-called "friends" from the current distribution list to include a person like yourself, who has demonstrated refined taste and sensibility.  Stax, by now I've either scared you away for good, or you are even sicker and more attention starved than me. Perhaps I should seem less desperate for unsolicited readers in the future, and pretend like each is one of many, but for now, I feel like I need to pay careful attention to retaining Stax as a reader. And Stax wants me to consider the libertarain candidate. So I will. Stax, will you stay? Please.  Stax views the choice as one of voting on the basis of principle versus tribal loyalty. Very astute, because there is much to be said for the tribal loyalties held by the partisans of the left and right. Look at the comparative political situations of George Bush and Tony Blair. Blair, a liberal who joined forces with Bush to depose Saddam, faces the "liar liar pants on fire" in its most extreme forms from the British right, whereas Bush clearly faces this from the US left. Why aren't US liberals supporting a policy embraced by their favorite UK prime minister? Why do the conservative Brits suddenly find a recommitment to beneficent imperialism objectionable? Simple - neither is in control in their own country. Their tribal loyalties blind them to the more dangerous foe. This is why the extreme left-wing doesn't blink when they paint a Hitler mustache on Bush, despite the irony that his greatest sin in their eyes is deposing the would-be Hitler Saddam.  It puts me in mind of the Monty Python film the  Life of Brian , and a scene wherein various anti-Roman groups had inadvertantly launched a plan to take a strike against the empire on the same night, found that their plots were entangled, and began to fight with each other. Before the fight reached a fevered pitch, one of the participants spoke up loudly to say that the two groups, though they disagreed on much, were united by a larger cause - a common enemy. He didn't name the common enemy, but someone from the opposing group did. Rather than name the Romans, he named another organization that, like these two, was opposed to the Romans. And everyone agreed and decided to work together. The British right and American left are united by the common enemy - the Bush-Blair alliance - not the fight against terrorism.  But I digress. I actually did vote for the libertarian candidate back in 1996 (Harry Brown, I believe). I lived in Minnesota at the time, so a vote cast for Dole wasn't going to do much good. But Stax raises an interesting question that also faces those Dems who prefer Nader to Kerry: does principle require not considering the probable consequences of your vote? OK, the probable consequence of your vote is precisely nil. But assuming that there is some impact, if you knew that a vote cast on principle would lead to the election of the candidate that least conforms to your views, is that the principled vote to make? I guess an argument can be made either way - my guess is that Stax is not indifferent to Bush and Kerry, but thinks that the potential short-term cost would be countered by a long-term benefit.  And certainly there is a troubling self-fulfilling logic to considering the likely consequences of one's vote, as this requires a guess about how other people would vote. The same calculus figures into the money-raising efforts of candidates, so that in the end the parties put forward the candidate that they think other people will vote for (Kerry) rather than the candidate they probably prefer (Dean). Perhaps if people didn't make such calculations, we'd have an exciting four way race with Ralph and Mike Badnarik each having a real shot at winning. Or, even more interesting, people might use the logic that they'd prefer to vote for Bush, but by not voting for Badnarik, they'd be increasing the chances that Ralph got elected, and they'd never to be able to buy a Corvair again!  Here is a solution I think everyone would embrace - don't tell us whose running. When we show up in the voting booth, hand us a brochure that has the platform of the previously undisclosed candidates, and let the chips fall where they may. No boring debates, no freak-show conventions, no TV advertisements, no seemingly endless speculation on current polling data, and no blogs dedicated to politics. Sure, no doubt Congressional Democrats would argue that the need to read the brochure amounts to a poll tax, but maybe we could bring in International observers from the UN (maybe the Chinese contingent, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria, where they know a thing or two about fair elections) to read the brochures aloud.  Under that system, Stax, Badnarik can count on my vote. In the meantime, I'm voting against John Kerry.

      (Warning: if there is such a thing, this is clearly a chick blog entry)  My daily commute pleasure involves biking past the front of the Lincoln Memorial, casting a glance up at Abe, and trying to avoid ramming into a photo-snapping Japenese tourist in the process. But in the mornings, it is usually only me, the cops who are stationed by the fences to preclude trucks loaded down with explosives from getting too close to Abe, and the guys who operate the POW/MIA booths 365 days per year. Gazing to my right, I have a view of the Reflecting pool, the new WW II Memorial, and the Washington Monument.  This morning as I biked past Abe, the tip of the Washington Monument was pointing directly at the rising - OK, the risen - sun (I am never headed to work so early as to see the rising sun). The sky was clear blue, and the air was crisp, making it feel more like a September morning than a hot and muggy August one. I was reminded of waking up in Cape May, New Jersey, two blocks from the beach on Jackson Street, five years ago this morning with my wife. Cape May, unlike the majority of the Jersey Coast, faces more to the south than then east, so our sunrise walk had us looking parallel to the beach, with the sun rising half on land and half over sea.  We woke up early to watch the sunrise to mark our two- year Anniversery. That was a feat made easier by the enforced vacation sobriety of her being 6 months pregnant with our first children (twins). At the time, we agreed that waking up to catch the sunrise would be a good way to start each new year of marriage, and thus a tradition was established. The next year the tradition was broken, as all fine traditions eventually are. Once you've had twins, you quickly jettison any tradition that cuts into sleep.  It has now been seven great years since we wed. In those seven years, we have: had three children; moved from Minneapolis to Washington D.C., back again, and back again once more; sold and purchased three homes; painted and repainted 30 rooms; and changed an estimated 12 thousand diapers. And we did it all as a team (OK, I didn't change more than a quarter of the diapers, but I painted all the rooms). Through it all as a team!  At this rate, we will have at least three more kids, and we will be solely responsible for allowing our realtor to retire early. Don't believe me about the kids? Well, in year eight, specifically no later than March 3rd, we'll have added a fourth to our litter. We have our fingers crossed for a girl. With four boys, I can see it now:  "Dad, we're headed to the golf course, we'll see you later."  "Wait guys, I'll go get my clubs. I think they are down in the basement. Let me go get 'em. Why, I remember when I used to go golfing with my dad ..."  My voice fades as I head down the stairs, while the boys have already started the car and headed for the links. Golf is meant for foursomes. Of course, if we have a girl, she could be the next Anika Sorenstam, and I'll still be stuck looking for my defective clubs in the basement. But either way, our marriage is clearly blessed!

      In a southern suburb of Minneapolis, there is a park called Terrace Oaks with a mountain bike trail. A friend and I, mountain bikes in tow, set out for that park to become tried and true mountain bikers. We didn't want to be part of the high percentage of people who purchase mountain bikes but never hit a trail. Now my friend is a top-of-the-line consumer, so his mountain bike came equipped with the clip-in petals, which are sort of like a ski binding in that you have to make an effort to release your foot from the petal. On a mountain bike, once that pedal gets slightly mudded-up, this becomes more difficult.  We were screaming along the path, on a slight down hill. The path was not single trek at this point, so we were side by side with room to spare. But, like all Junes in Minnesota, this one had seen its share of rain, and so it was only a matter of time before our path was obstructed by what looked like a deep mud puddle, stretching across the entire width of our path, and about twenty feet along it. Instinctively, we both stopped as soon as we saw it, and pondered are next move.  My friend clipped into his petals, and tried to proceed slowly through the mud. A slow ride through would minimize the mud kicked into the moving parts of our delicate machines, which can require significant maintenance efforts if not kept clean. Or so we reasoned at the time. But a slow ride also has the drawback of providing rider and bike scant momentum. A body in motion tends to stay in motion, and a fast body in motion even tends to stay in motion when wheels are peeling through four inches of muddy bog. The same cannot be said for a slow body in motion. He got in about a bike length when his feet came to a slow hault. At that time he had one second when the bike was still balanced upright to kick out one of his feet. He needed two. He fell to his left, mud all over his body and face. And of course I laughed, walked my bike through the mud, and filed the story away in my memory.  Now, there are many things about mountain biking that are completely obvious after you've screwed it up. The after-the-fact obvious strategy would have been to keep our speed and just tear through the mud, and it would have worked. But I don't care how smart you are (and my friend is the smartest guy I know), your instincts tell you to stop the first time you see that obtrusive mud. Anyone who has mountain biked on a trail has probably made a similar stupid mistake.  Another one is locking up your front brake. It's an equation for a one-and-one-half flip with a 180 degree twist, and unless you do it just prior to riding into a pool, it hurts. You only make that mistake once, but you do make it.  Which brings me to the Presidential election, and the tale of two mountain bikers. One - Bush - recently had two mountain biking accidents, the second of which had him doing his Greg Louganis imitation over the handlebars, landing squarely onto his back. Chances are he won't do it again. But the first accident was more in line with the typical hazards of trail riding - it was a fall that anyone could expect to make out on the trail. He may repeat that one on unfamiliar trails, but probably not again on the specific trail he was riding.   The local newscaster, in reporting the story, mentioned that the President was riding his new $3100 mountain bike. The relevance of the price of the mountain bike to the story was not explained.  The first fall prompted his opponent to quip that his advisors shouldn't have removed his training wheels. Get it? Bush is dumb and lacks coordination. Isn't that funny? Ha Ha. Kerry has his own mountain bike. In my lifetime, I have only purchased two cars that are more expensive than his $8000 two-wheeler. It has no training wheels, but it has also never seen a trail that wasn't macadam. He's been photographed fully decked out in spandex and acrylic biking gear, taking a treachorous corner of a tarred path, donning an aerodynamic helmet meant to protect that most precious of national assets (take your pick among his hair, his botoxed face, or his nuanced brain) in case the back wheel should catch a spot of goose excrement left unremoved by employees of the National Park Agency. But that will not happen, because John Kerry does not fall, as he was quick to inform agents of the press when, err, he  appeared  to fall while skiing. But  he  didn't fall; a secret service agent cut him off, and was berated for it.  And its' a good thing he didn't fall off of his bike, for several reasons. First, if he would have suffered any abrasions, he'd be lobbying to receive his fourth purple heart. Second, the nearest Secret Service agent would have probably been fired. Third, John Edwards would have been hired to sue the National Parks Agency, the maker of the bike, the maker of the helmet, and the family of the Secret Service agent. Why? Because John Kerry doesn't fall, and therefore if he falls, there must have been gross negligence on the part of multiple parties. What did Bush do when he fell? He got up and kept riding. He no doubt was slightly embarressed, but he shook it off.  It's a story of no grand significance, but it illustrates a general character trait of Kerry that is disturbing. I laughed when my friend fell, but it was with the humility borne from the knowledge that, there, but for the grace of God, go I. That knowledge came from my own near and not-so-near misses while mountain biking, and the fact that my friend, who is a good athlete and who is far smarter than Kerry, could still find his left side caked in mud. But John Kerry would never hit the trail, and yet he jokes with the arrogance of someone who is pretending to a status he has not earned. And this, in my opinion, is a metaphor for his life.  Maybe, like Bush (at least in my opinion), he will earn the status he pretends to merit now while in office, but right now his manner suggests that his superior fitness for office is self-evident, not in need of any objective support outside of his own very deep self-regard. Somehow we are expected to believe that his famous nuanced mind will balance in favor of the common good the internal dissonance of being a gold-digging billionaire populist, an ex-war hero pacifist, an ex-war protesting hawk, an SUV-driving private plane flying environmentalist, and a unilateral multilateralist.  Sorry, aint buying it, unless and until the guy takes to the trail, scrapes his botoxed face, and learns a little humility.

      "Who Me?" I feel like the Alfred E. Newman of the blogosphere. Six comments on yesterday's blog (a new record I believe for Ideas Hatched, though I, the Hatcher, put in one of them), but two commenters made the blogosphere faux pas of questioning my credibility on various and asunder assertions made with the bravado that is usually sufficient to cow all would-be doubters. Let me explain something to you people - the blogosphere is all about the democratization of unsubstantiated opinions. Why should the New York Times have a monopoly on using shoddy or non-existent facts to build castles of logic built on sand? It's a revolution, people! If you don't like my set of facts, make up your own and be on your way!  Still, given that the readership of the New York Times is well into the millions, and mine is about 10, maybe I should distinguish myself from them through being unimpeachably credible. There is a difference between saying that a comment I make goes unsubstantiated versus the contention that it is unsubstantiable (not a word, I know, but it should be). And that I will prove to you now. Though I generally try to restrain from responding to comments, I make this one time exception to establish the fact that you need never doubt the Hatcher again. (Granted, my back-up support is found from googling and looking at other websites that I assume must be credible. And they in turn probably do the same. In the end, every article on the web - conservative or liberal in tone - is probably based on one of two sets of completely made up and contradictory facts.)  Comment #1 (from the ubiquitous anonymous):  At long last we see some numbers (albeit uncited) to support assertions in the blog. Let's see what went unsupported....most countries in western Europe have stagnant economies and high unemployment...Canadian health care has long lines (oh sorry that was yesterday)...the rhetoric about big corporations and govt doesn't ring true for most people...  I actually posted a response to this comment yesterday, but was unable to link in the comment for some reason. So here is the link - it links to an Adobe  urlLink file  - you'll find the key line towards the bottom of the first column, but I'll quote it here:  "The peer-reviewed literature on waiting times has found that Canadians tend to experience some of the logest waiting times in the world. In 2003, Canadian patients waited almost 18 weeks from the time their general practitioner referred them to a specialist for care to the time they actually received treatment."  Now picture the horror of Canadian women waiting 18 weeks for a C-section!  For the moribund nature of the four largest Western European economies, look  urlLink here . Albeit, the same cited page says that if you remove France, Germany, Spain, and Italy (the four largest economies in Western Europe), the rest of the countries look OK. But don't feel sorry for the unemployed in France, Germany, etc. These guys probably get paid as much for 52 weeks of vacation as the rest of the workers get paid while getting only 12 weeks of vacation. They are the lucky ones.  As for the rhetoric about big corps and govt not ringing true for most people, well, I got nothing. It's an opinion about other people's opinions. To substantiate it I'd have to be a sociologist, but fortunately instead I decided to get educated. Or I'd have to listen to other people's opinions - not going to happen. So I hereby make the following correction: add the words "I don't think ..."  Comment #2 (from Professor Vic):  I like the fact that one of the posters comments on the use of a few data points to support the assertions in the blog. I'll take issue with Hatch's comment, "in the early stages of the Great Depression, we elected FDR, whose policies contributed to the length and severity of the Depression." This statement, as usual, is not supported by any data... (Professor Vic then goes on to provide data regarding GDP growth under Roosevelt, arguing that his performance may have been quite robust.)  I fully realize that this simplistic analysis would indeed be ripped apart by an anonymous referee in an academic journal. So too would a comment like, "in the early stages of the Great Depression, we elected FDR, whose policies contributed to the length and severity of the Depression," without any data to back such a comment up.  Is that so Professor Vic? Not if you ask one of the former stars of the Economics Department intramural basketball team. Sure, his defensive repertoire never involved the Lambier-esque (or should I say Professor Vic Matheson-esque) clotheslining move on the opposition, but he nonetheless was a key player. Here is what he has to  urlLink say.  Not sure if the Minneapolis Fed Quarterly Review is refereed, but I am sure you or I can't get published there. Some quotes from Professor O'Hanian:  "Productivity grew rapidly after 1933. Theory predicts that the economy should have recovered to trend by 1936, with above-trend labor input supporting higher consumption and investment. But hours worked remained 20-25 % below trend until World War II. So why was labor input so low given rapid productivity growth? It wasn't because other shocks were negative - banking panics and deflation ended in 1933, and real interest rates were low."  There must have been a major negative shock to offset the recovery of economic fundamentals and keep the economy depressed. The government adopted some extreme labor and industrial policies (the National Industrial Recovery Act) in 1933 that really distorted markets. These policies suspended the antitrust laws and permitted collusion, provided that the rents were shared with labor... In contrast to the fast recovery predicted by standard theory, our model predicts economic activity remains far below trend after 1933. We concluded that these policies were a key factor behind the persistence of the Depression.  Ironically, President Roosevelt thought that "excessive" competition was responsible for the Depression, and that these policies would bring recovery. He was wrong. My colleague Armen Alchian was a student at Stanford at the time, and told me that his professors thought the policies were crazy - they couldn't understand how promoting monopoly could raise employment. It is unfortunate that Roosevelt didn't listen to these mainstream economists - if he had, the recovery would have been much stronger. These policies were finally weakened during World War II - and employment rose substantially.  There also seemed to be a sentiment to redistribute income during the 1930s. But this policy was a really inefficient method of redistribution. It created a lot of inequality by shutting down employment."  Game Set, and Match to ... the Hatcher!

      2. If Republicans are such good stewards of the economy, why is it that among the 11 presidents our country has had since comprehensive quarterly GDP first became available in 1946, Democratic presidents rank 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in GDP growth during their terms while the Republicans rank 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11?  President GDP growth Rank Truman 4.65% 3 Eisenhower 2.44% 9 Kennedy 5.33% 1 Johnson 4.88% 2 Nixon 3.09% 7 Ford 2.06% 11 Carter 3.20% 6 Reagan 3.47% 5 Bush I 2.12% 10 Clinton 3.56% 4 Bush II 2.48% 8  Democrats 4.33% Republicans 2.65%   The first problem with this question is the confused notion of stewardship it embodies. We hear the political rhetoric of whether the president has the economy "on the right track", as if an economy of 250 million dynamic hard-working and highly educated people is dependent upon the actions of one man. The impression is given that, in your lifetime, the most important economic decisions you will make will amount to punching a chad once every four years (or not fully punching one, if you live in Florida), and all the time in between you merely need to cross your fingers. It also suggests that, in the history of the United States, which has been marked by an overall growth trend disrupted occasionally by a recession and in one case by a severe depression, what saved us from the economic abyss that, say, the Soviet Union fell into, was our great wisdom as voters. Somehow we always know to elect the guy that is going to bail us out. One problem with that theory: in the early stages of the Great Depression, we elected FDR, whose policies contributed to the length and severity of the Depression.  The rhetoric reflects the grandiose self-importance of Democratic politicians. See how important they are? Rather than saying, during my tenure, over 100 million new jobs were created, they say that "I created over 100 million new jobs." The only way a president creates a new job is to expand an already bloated bureaucracy, and no one (excepting of course bureaucrats and Democrats) wants more bureaucrats.  That said, facts is facts, and the rankings tell a story. But if it is the story that my friend implicitly suggests, why doesn't he pursue the notion that correlation implies causation in this case, and publish a nice article in a respectable economics journal? The referee comments on that would make this blog look downright civil.  The best that can be said about the rankings is that they prove no President can really screw us up for long, or even at all in some cases, despite their best efforts to do so. And party affiliation, unfortunately, is not necessarily a great predictor of the economic policy inclinations of the President. Kennedy passed huge cuts in personal income taxes, whereas Nixon instituted price controls. Is it fair to suggest that this should make us identify efforts to cut taxes with Democrats, and efforts to heavily regulate markets with Republicans? LBJ scores very high on the list, but the growth during that period occurred simultaneous with the abysmal failure of his War on Poverty; poverty won a resounding victory, and drew new adherents to its side in droves while taxpayers watched the money go down the drain. Carter is barely beneath Reagan, but of course Reagan had to take the hard and necessary step of wringing inflation out of the system that occurred under Carter's watch, which every economist knows causes a temporary recession (1981-82). There are a million other reasons why the suggested causation is not worthy of serious speculation.  The notion that Republicans are better stewards of the economy, if it is even generally held, has its source in the comparative attitudes of Democrats and Republicans to business, unions, the social safety net, regulation, and the role of government. Across the board, Republicans are generally correctly perceived as desiring policies that are better for the economy.  Social Safety Net: Look at countires that have instituted social policies that Democrats would adopt in a heart beat, like most of the countries in Western Europe, and you see stagnant economies with high unemployment. The problem is that these guys have made the social safety net so soft, that all of their citizens just want to bounce on it all day. The Democrats look to Cuba as a model for health care and education.  Unions: Hey, they served their purpose at one time, but now they serve merely to prop up a monopoly based on thuggery. Were again 'em, and Democrats are for 'em.  Business: Big Pharma, Big Oil, Wal Mart, Halliburton, etc. Were for 'em, Dems are again 'em. Wal-mart, a particular whipping boy of the Democrats, was estimated to have accounted for 25 percent of productivity growth in the late '90s. And you can't find a liberal these days who has anything nice to say about them. You can say: what about Enron? And I would answer, what about it? The guys are going to jail, and they were equal opportunity political contributors, giving lavishly to both parties. And Halliburton's no-bid contract to provide services in post-war Iraq? Turns out they got the same contract for Kosovo under the Clinton administration. Why? Because no one else can bid on it. The rhetoric that Big Corporations are out to screw you, and that government is there to protect you from that happening, doesn't ring true for most people. From Wal-Mart, I can get a five gallon bucket of pickles for $3; from the Federal government, $3 might buy the same, but Ted Kennedy would eat four of the five gallons before I ever got to chomp on a Vlassic.  Regulation: Excessive regulation may not have a large negative effect on GDP growth, but nevertheless its hard to claim that an increasing share of GDP owing to regulatory compliance efforts is a good thing. My employment is directly tied to the regulatory apparatus - but nothing that I do in my job contributes to consumer welfare. The same can be said of the entire Northwest section of Washington D.C., a very wealthy and highly educated populace that could be curing cancer if it weren't so much more easy to make a buck as a lawyer. And guess what? Though we are all employed ostensibly in the regulatory apparatus, there is some truth to the "capture theory of regulation", which suggests that the industry tends to capture the regulators, turning them into an ally that protects the industry rather than a watchdog. Why? Because those on the regulation side want to land in a nice soft job handling regulatory affairs for the industry that they regulate, and pissing people off does not serve that strategy.  Government: Two paraphrased quotes. Bill Clinton, on discussing what to do with the surplus: "We could give it back to you, but if you don't spend it right..." (see Ted Kennedy and the pickles). Ronald Reagan: "Government is not the solution to the problem; government is the problem."

      A liberal friend offers up two softballs for IdeasHatched, though he no doubt thinks he is throwing me a knuckler. Here is his e-mail, followed by my response:  So, I'll give you two easy starting lines for your Blog. "The most intelligent liberal friend I have (and I do have some) asked me this question the other day..." 1. If private markets are so wonderful, how is it that the industrialized nation with the highest level of privately provided health care (the U.S.) has the most expensive health care and the lowest life expectancy among rich countries? or 2. If Republicans are such good stewards of the economy, why is it that among the 11 presidents our country has had since comprehensive quarterly GDP first became available in 1946, Democratic presidents rank 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in GDP growth during their terms while the Republicans rank 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11? "My answer to my friend the genius is..."  I only have time to answer the first question today, but I'll address the second question tomorrow, except to say that the fact the first question (and other similar questions) is asked often by Democrats is part of the answer to the second question. Democrats look at Cuba and say - everyone has healthcare insurance - whereas in the US people go without. See? The US is not so great after all. Of course, when these guys need an operation, you don't see them running to Cuba. But the fact that they ask questions like this make people nervous, and deservedly so.  That healthcare in the US is expensive is not in dispute, but you get what you pay for. If my liberal friend were, for example, to make the wise decision to get a labotamy, he could no doubt schedule that operation in a day, whereas in Canada or the UK, he'd be put on a long waiting list, both because there are more liberals there in need of such corrective procedures, and more importantly because their state-run systems are abonimably slow. And the likelihood that the lobotomy in the US would be successful is far higher; he may emerge from the Canadian operating room asking even sillier questions than this one.  You either allocate resources through the price mechanism, as a market based system does, or you put in price controls that have the effect of limiting the supply, and let people sit in line and hope they don't die before their number is called. The one system gives the bum and the benefactor the same chance of survival; the other doesn't. You decide which is more fair.  It is also true that healthcare is in fact a very regulated market, so it is a mistake to say that it is a free market. There are obvious hurdles that doctors have to clear in order to practice medicine. Such barriers to entry restrict supply and increase costs. Maybe the barriers are too high, although because it is hard for any customer to judge the quality of a doctor, it makes sense to set a barrier that improves the likelihood of competence in the profession. That is, there is some benefit to regulation in that market. But it is the regulation that increases costs. Comparatively speaking, we may set higher hurdles, which makes care more expensive but also higher quality.  Another reason US healthcare is so expensive: Big Pharma. I was once vacationing on a tropical island when I came across Big Pharma. Rich bastard. He was sitting amongst a harem of high-priced professional gals, all drinking pina coladas poolside; him with his gold chains and gaudy diamond rings on each and every finger. He had reserved an entire wing of the hotel we were staying at, piddling away the enormous profits he made on alcohol, drugs, rock&amp;roll, and general debauchery. It was not hard to understand why US healthcare costs were so exhorbitant, given the display of conspicuous consumption Big Pharma was putting on. It was clear that he doesn't funnel any profits back into researching next generation pharmaceuticals. This leaves the fact -that virtually all great advancements in drug therapy come from the efforts of US companies (or the ability of foreign companies to sell into the unregulated US market) - one of those great mysteries of the universe. Thus, even if we put price controls in place like Canada, new more powerful drugs would continue to be developed out of thin air, as they apparently are today. So I agree with you here - we should put price controls in the drug market to reduce the cost of healthcare, and end Big Pharma's bacchanalia right now!  A third reason: John Edwards, and other similar trial lawyers. Want to know the cost of malpractice insurance, and from whence it stems? Do you think doctors pay this out of their own pocket rather than passing it off to you in the form of higher costs? My guess is that it is higher in the US than it is in other industrialized nations, but I am far too lazy to prove that. You'll just have to trust me.  So if the quality or our healthcare is better, why do we have a lower life expectancy? There is only so much even high quality healthcare can do. So we can look to factors outside of the quality of healthcare. Here is one - heart disease is the number one killer in the US, and obesity is a prime predictor of later heart disease. You want to know why there are no private charities advertising in the US to provide food to the hungry and impoverished within our borders? Because poor people in the US are  urlLink obese ! That says something, doesn't it - that the harshly capitalistic country we live in somehow finds a way to feed the poor a daily caloric intake that would satisfy Shaquille O'Neal. Want to improve life expectancy? Don't let people with foodstamps buy Doritos!

      I came across this quote in a book recently:  "Freudian analysis is nothing if not a system that compels its acolytes to render the fiercest judgments on those nearest and dearest to them."  I think that there is a certain type of personality that is attracted to psychoanalysis. There is a certain egocentrism to that attraction that stands out. I also know that many aspects of our personality are genetic in origin, and my bet is that the source of an attraction to psychoanalysis is genetic. That is not to say that people who go to psychoanalysis don't have legitmate complaints about their parents - they may, but it seems to me that dwelling on the shortcomings of your parents is too often a crutch to explain your own.  And a certain personality needs that crutch.  If I am right, and genetics determine who goes to psychoanalysis, then whether or not my kids end up seeing a shrink is independent of my behavior. No matter how I act, I won't keep them out of therapy. So I often ask myself - if I've passed on some genetic predisposition for my kids to pay some quack $300 an hour to trash me, what will be their indictment of me? I don't ask the question rhetorically out of conceit that I am not capable of behavior that will screw them up down the line. Rather, I ask myself the question so that I can choose how I will ultimately be criticized. Do I want to be the distant tough guy or the new-age sensitive enabler? It's not an easy decision.  It puts in mind of an essay I once read by Andrew Ferguson on the then burgeoning "men's movement."  This was the poor man's psychoanalysis, done in the presence of other men.  He has an hilarious passage that I quote here at length so that anyone of you out there who is father to a son will see what is at stake in the choice of how to screw up your kid:  "Tell me about your fathers...", Lee said, and they did. "But I must ask you this - make your comments short and succinct, so we can all talk."  Good luck, fellows! It was an impossible request.  One lucky guy from Lubbuck jumped in first: "My dad - I feel a real need to reconnect with the other men here because it was just like his hyperreligiosity that I just couldn't work through when he'd come to me and ..." Good luck John! But it is not for nothing that John Lee is a superstar, a workshop sultan.  He vacuumed the fog of loggorrhea that was gathering in the center of the room by cutting the fellow off.  He instead suggested the men break up into little groups, according to what kind of dad they had.  All you with passive fathers, leave your seats and come up to the front of the room.  I tell you, the passive father is one of the most abusive kinds of father there is.  He just won't do it.  'Dad', you say, 'I want to talk about masturbation,' and it's like, 'Argh, I ain't gonna listen to ya.'  Like that.  You know?  "Ho!"  "Critical fathers - really abusive - you all come up here."  "What about if your father was really passive until he drank?"  "Over here", said John authoritatively.  "If you had a dad who just wasn't f*&%ing there, just a disappearing dad, you all get here in the center."  People with aggressive dads were put over by the window. A number of men had questions about what kind of dad they had, and they inquired at great length.  "What if your dad wasn't exactly invisible; it was that you were just sort of invisible, he wouldn't notice you unless sometimes - like there was once..."  John put him with the disappearing dads.  A mountain, a Matterhorn, an Everest of grievances!  They dissolved and poured out in tears and sometimes in gut-wrenching field hollers.  One fellow had to sit all by himself, because he said his dad was okay. This brought John up short.  Momentarily.  "We'll talk about this dad later. Because let me tell you", John said, full of pity, "this dad - this one who did a pretty good job - this dad is the toughest of all.  We've got some work to do."  Meaning: Let's talk.  "My dad never taught me how to be intimate with a woman," one man said.  "The men's movement will teach you," John reassured him.  "It's going to take some time.  You better be in it for the long haul."  One fellow's dad refused to go out to brunch with him. "Ho!" said the other men.  Nobody's dad would talk the way the New Men wanted him to talk.  They wanted to talk about their feelings; Dad wanted to watch football or read the paper or, worse, go to work.  But there comes a point when the talking must cease and another kind of work be done.  The last hour was given over to a guided meditation.  The men let their heads fall as the lights in the room went down and they were told to envision Dad in their mind's eye.  John's voice was quiet.  "Tell your dad good-bye.  Good-bye, Dad. I gotta letcha go.  Dad left you.  Now you leave him.  Gotta letcha go."  The sniffles began in the darkened room, and then the keening, and the mewling, and then a loud "Daddy!"  And then another: "Bastard!"  And so ends my long exercise in plagiarism.  But now do you grasp the importance of my decision?  I've always wanted to be the okay dad, but as it turns out that could make me one of the toughest of all - worse even then the passive father who doesn't teach his kids to masturbate!  **************************************************************  The author of the first quote above, in an earlier passage, comments that the "Freudian psychoanalytical enterprise constituted a politics as well as a psychology, and even at times a moral system. Its morality was an inverted Puritanism that conferred upon the most extreme varieties of self-revelation and self-vindication the status of an absolute ethical imperative. In the politics of Freudian analysis, villainy was unequivocally identified with the disabling impostures of the bourgeois family." And finally, "it may well have been this view of the bourgeois family that commended Freudian analysis to intellectuals ...in the wake of their disenchantment with Marxism ... On the couch, Marxian class conflict was transformed into a contest with parents, siblings, and spouses, while the bourgeois enemy remained firmly in place as the obstacles to be surmounted."  The essay that contained these comments was a review of memoir published by a literary critic who, in her private life, was dedicated to her own psychoanalysis. She remarks in the memoirs that "Freudian thought excited much emotions among intellectuals, but not much intellection. Intellectuals tended, indeed, to voice their opinion of analysis in the language of religion: one 'believed' or did not 'believe' in it." Her husband, also a famous literary critic and devotee to psychoanalysis, received what must have amounted to his last rites in the Freudian religion, meeting for one last session with his analyst at his deathbed.  Perhaps rather than confessing in search of absolution, he simply sat quietly while his analyst assured him, and any higher power that may have been listening, that any buggery he may have committed in life ultimately is the fault of his distant father, or smothering mother, or a combination of the two.
