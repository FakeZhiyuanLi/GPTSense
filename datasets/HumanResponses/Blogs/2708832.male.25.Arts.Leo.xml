      Strange things can happen when you least expect it.   This weekend was suppose to be a nice relaxing weekend at home. That all changed at 11:30 last night. My girlfriend and I were watching  Cabin Fever  (review will be up when we finish watching it) when I get a phone call from a friend of mine. She needs someone to edit an interview she just filmed with  Lloyd Kaufman  and she needs it by the morning. I freak out, turn the movie off and we are on our way to pick up my friend and edit this video.   Lloyd Kaufman is one of the reasons I wanted to make films. His love of independent film and his knowledge of filmmaking is amazing. This is the man who created  The Toxic Avenger , released Trey Parker on the world, gave Billy Bob Thorton his first role - this man is more important then most people in Hollywood.   As we are on the way to my work to edit the video I find out that it was shot in my friends house and that she will be showing it to Lloyd Kaufman on Saturday afternoon. The plan is to produce a documentary on him to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his company  Troma Entertainment . By coming through and editing the promo I am told I am now part of the team and to be at  Suspect Video  by 3 p.m. Saturday to meet Lloyd.   Holy shit! Meet Lloyd!   Going on no sleep or food we arrive at  Suspect Video  early and meet Lloyd. I'm a nervous wreck until we start talking. He likes the promo and is impressed we cut it so fast. He likes the idea of the project and invites us to come to New York (Troma's headquarters) to film him and the rest of his team in action. We spend two hours just hanging out with him. He signs my copy of  All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger  and my DVD for the  The Toxic Avenger Part 2 .   He is a great guy and is willing to help anyone who loves filmmaking as much as him. I am still in shock of what has just happened in the last 24 hours. I met my idol and got a gig working on a documentary about him. Now it is time for sleep.   Photo's and video will be up on the web soon.

      I&nbsp;am going nuts listening to everyone who has a PVR (Personal Video Recorder) talk about how great they are. I hate my VCR and am in desperate need of taking control of my TV watching habits. If I was an American I would be hooked up with Tivo by now. However I am a Canadian and Tivo feels that Canada is not worthy of its service.   My options are the SA8000 from Scientific-Atlanta or the Bell ExpressVU 5900 or 5920. Both are not highly recommended and both are expensive.   The SA8000 is offered through Rogers Cable - it sells for $599.99 minus a $100.00 programming credit ($10 per month). It is suppose to be available for rent in the next few months and that is what I am holding out for. I refuse to buy one since the firewire port is not working, it is not HD and there is hundreds of bugs and overheating issues. Plus it does not record that much (only has a 40GB HDD).   The Bell ExpressVU 5900 or 5920 runs for $599.99 ($499.99 with a two-year contract). It is not HD but does have a 120GB HDD. I don't like being locked into a contract and I find the ExpressVU guide to be choppy.   There is a few other options like the Pioneer DVD Recorder w/ 80GB HDD (runs for about a $1000.00) or hacking a Series 1 Tivo. My problems with both of these is that they are not built in to my STB and therefore are not a 100% compatible.   I guess I have to wait until I can rent one from Rogers or until I can buy one from Tivo.

      Well yesterday the nominations were announced.  Lord of the Rings  cleaned up - no surprise. But  Master &amp; Commander  coming in with the second amount of votes is shocking. This movie looked horrible (one of the worst movie titles ever). Critics even said it WAS horrible - why the nominations then? I can't destroy the movie because I have not seen it but from what I have seen it looks bad, bad, bad.   No nominations for  Big Fish  is disappointing. Too many nominations for  Lost in Translation  is disappointing. It is the year of the  Lord of the Rings  though so I guess it doesn't matter.

      In today's National Post there is an article on how CityTV's news anchors (mainly Gord Martineau) act behind-the-scenes in an unprofessional way. After reading the article and finding the actual video on the internet I do not believe they are making fun of anyone or are hurting anyone. Gord is a tad nuts but his co-workers seem to get a kick out of it.   In a job where almost everything you report is tragic you need a little humor to take the edge off. I applaud CityTV for defending them and hope that the public will support them on this as well.    urlLink Link to the National Post artcle     urlLink Link to view the video (thanks to edge 102)

      Last nights Golden Globes were pretty much what I expected.   My biggest shock was when  Lost in Translation  beat  Big Fish  for Best Comedy/Musical. My second biggest shock was when  Sofia Coppola  won for Best Director (Comedy/Musical). I really do not think this movie was deserving of these awards - it was good but nothing special. I also do not remember laughing once during this movie and do not consider it to be a comedy.   Will any of it reflect on the Oscars? I feel that  Lord of the Rings  might be shunned by the Academy. The reaction from the crowd wasn't too exciting when it won for Best Drama. Maybe everyone just expected it? I guess we will soon find out.    Some great moments from last night:    Mary-Louise Parker's breast comment (and breasts!)  Nicole Kidman reading off her list of men she has been with (or Best Male Actor in a Drama)  Charlize Theron winning and NOT crying like an idiot    The Worst Moments:    Danny DeVito's speech for Michael Douglas  Al Pacino's speech

       ** out of 5 stars    Don't you hate waching a movie you once really liked and questioning why?   Last night I watched  Strange Days , a movie I once really liked and praised. Well last night I was really disappointed at how badly it has aged. I cringed whenever they talked about being "wired in" and hooked on "tape". If you've never seen this movie do yourself a favor and don't.   When this movie came out in 1995 it was an interesting look on the year 2000 and what might be in store for us. Four years after Y2K it is just a pile of laughable crap.   I actually disliked it so much that my DVD is going up on ebay this afternoon.

       **** out of 5 stars    I am a big fan of Tim Burton. A few of my favorite movies have been made by him ("Ed Wood", "Mars Attacks!" and "Edward Scissorhands" to name a few). Even though "Planet of the Apes" was a load of crap I still enjoyed what Tim was trying to do, I was however worried he had lost his magic.   "Big Fish" brings back the magic that Tim has. The same magic in "Edward Scissorhands" and "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure". The story, acting, cinematography - it is all magical.   The premise is simple but effective. Edward Bloom (Ewen McGregor and Albert Finney) loves to tell tales of his weird adventures to his son Will (played by Billy Crudup in the adult years). Will has never believed his father's stories and resents him for never telling the truth. After Will gets married he moves to France and doesn't speak to his father for three years. When Edward gets sick, Will returns home to help his mother and try to get the real story of his father's life.   The stories Edward tells are of giants and hidden towns, love and destiny and of course a big fish he caught the day Will was born. Is any of it true? Is he just trying to make his life sound more interesting then it really was? Does any of it matter? By the end of the movie you want to believe and do believe what you just saw.   A film that makes me truly care for the characters and makes me feel as though I am sharing a moment instead of watching a film is a great movie in my opinion.

       *** out 5 stars    The Apple 23" Cinema HD Display is a very impressive display, but for the $2799.99 CDN price tag is it worth it?   I use one at work to edit video and for this it is awesome. A wider screen enables me to have more windows in view which is important when using software like Final Cut Pro. It is also a more professional looking display. Clients come in and automatically "WOW" comes out of their mouths.   So why does it only get three stars? First - it is not as crisp as I would like. When I load a DVD on my PC using a 21" Dell CRT display it looks sharp and crisp. On the Cinema HD it looks fuzzy (unless I minimize the DVD player). I have tried to fix this with tweaking the settings but nothing helps. I should be able to play a DVD on my entire screen with no problem and I can't. The second problem is a little more serious - burn-in. Burn-in occurs when a still image is left on the screen for too long. It doesn't take too long for this get burn-in. There is fixes for it however and by turning down the brightness and turning on Energy Saver you can help prolong the life (and since this costs more then a HDTV-ready TV you want it to last for a few years).   If you are thinking of getting this display I would suggest waiting for the price to come down or buy the 20" model for $1000.00 less. It is impressive though and if that is what you are going for then it is worth it.    Related Links:    urlLink Apple Canada    urlLink Apple U.S.A

      I just started using  urlLink Zap2It.com  in the last week and I love it. From what I can tell it has more accurate info then my cable and satellite provider combined.   I highly recommend it to anyone fed up with their on-screen guide being wrong all the time.

      A few months ago my girlfriend and I started watching the films on the AFI Top 100 film list. The rules we set for ourselves are:   watch them all in a year.  we can watch them in random order.  even if we have seen it we have to watch it again for it to count.   Last night we checked off #18 - "Psycho".   Both of us have seen the film numerous times but this time it was different - we were watching the Collector's Edition DVD on a projector in our living room.   Before you think I have installed a top of the line home theatre system in my house and I am talking crazy let me explain how this came about. I borrowed an  Epson 51c Multimedia projector  and 8ft wide screen from work to see how it would look in our house (it was suppose to be for the weekend but I "forgot" to bring it back on Monday because we were enjoying it so much). Mounting the screen was a pain in the rear (plus a broken picture I have to replace!) and getting the projector lined up perfectly was a bigger pain in the rear (using a ladder with a board across it - I do not recommend this as it is not safe and could damage the equipment). The projector is very loud and not too bright but when I turned it on and played the beginning of the "Matrix: Reloaded" my mouth dropped and I was blown away.   Most of the movies we have watched so far are "special effects" movies that look awesome on a big screen so I was interested to see how a black and white thriller would look.   "Psycho" is a totally different experience on an 8ft wide screen. The black and white really looks beautiful and although it is not a "special effects" movie there is a lot to be gained by seeing it on a big screen. The parts that you always thought "how did people think this was scary?" are actually scary (surround sound helps the scare factor too). If you have never seen "Psycho" or our planning on watching it again do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest screen you can find.   The Collector's Edition DVD is also worth the purchase as there is some awesome making of features and advertising materials that really show you how it must have been to be one of the first people to see "Psycho".

       **** out of 5 stars    For almost ten years I have been pondering the purchase of a large capacity CD player for my home system. I love Pioneer - my receiver is Pioneer and my LaserDisc player is Pioneer (yes I have a LaserDisc player and I still watch movies on it!) so of course I wanted the CD player to match.   Since I tend to over think things I never purchased one and settled on using my single disc DVD player (Toshiba not Pioneer) as my CD player. The problem with this is that it does not play CD-R's and it tends to not play some protected CD's (like the remastered Dark Side of the Moon). Well this weekend I bought a large capacity Pioneer CD player on HBC.com for $99.99 CDN. and it rocks!    The Look    Looks are important when selecting items for a home system and this baby looks sleek. It is a bit larger then I expected but the shiny black finish and the tinted CD changer door really stick out. The girlfriend really likes the look too which is important.    The Remote    The remote is nothing special. Small buttons, hard to read functions and it looks like it came with a cheap combo unit stereo. I will be putting it away and never looking back when I get my universal.    Features    To my surprise there is an optical output (and standard RCA outputs) which was not mentioned when I purchased it. There is many different "list" modes so you can load it up and have a list for all the classic rock tracks or all the hip hop tracks or all the Rolling Stones CD's or...you get the point. All the usual CD player features are on this as well.    The Bottom Line    The suggested price for this player is $249.99 CDN. so the $99.99 price tag is a great deal. 25-disc capacity is a good size and suites me just fine. I wish it was capable of playing MP3's but then I wouldn't have a need to get an iPod next.    urlLink The link to the deal

      I was going to rant and rave at how stupid we Canadians (Quebec) are being towards the whole Conan O'Brien controversy, instead I am just going to thank him.    A Thank You Letter from a grateful Toronto Resident    Dear Mr. O'Brien   Thank you for being a great visitor to the city of Toronto. Thank you for making us look good while you were here. Thank you for bringing back all those great Canadians to share in the fun. I enjoyed every show you broadcast from Toronto (although Adam Sandler seemed quite "off") and would love to have you return during the summer.   Yours Truly,  Brian McKechnie

       **** out of 5 stars     NOTE: This review is based on one nights use on Rogers Cable in Toronto, Canada. My opinion could change after using it for a while. This is my first experience with a PVR. I have never, ever used one in my life and have nothing to compare it to. I do know a lot about them and had really high expectations after years of reading about TiVo and ReplayTV in the U.S.     The Look    The Scientific-Atlanta E8000 is a nice unit. The front is silver and displays a large digital clock. There are two USB ports on the front that are not currently working (future software update). The back looks like any other STB - Cable In, Cable Out, S-Video Out, Digital Audio Out (Coaxial) and an RCA Out 1 (TV). There are a few other connections that will not be working until a future software update. These include an RCA Out 2 (VCR), RCA Input (Aux) and two FireWire ports (IEEE 1394).    The Remote    The remote is a little big and heavy but fits my hand nicely. It was very easy to program for other devices such as a TV and VCR. The main buttons are positioned where they should be. One big problem with the remote is the PIP buttons at the bottom - very hard to control.    The Set-up    The unit is quite large and finding a home for it in my cabinet was the hardest part of setting it up. Once I found a good ventilated spot I easily incorporated this into my system within minutes. I highly recommend putting the unit somewhere that it cannot get too hot. This is basically a computer and therefore it will crash and act buggy if it overheats (I have not experienced this but have researched it). Setting a VCR or game system on it is a bad idea.    The First Time    After the initial boot I had an image and everything seemed to be working. The first thing I did was press the PAUSE button, waited a minute and pressed the PLAY button. To my surprise the video was all choppy and pixilated. I got a pain in my gut thinking this was a sign of things to come. I then read the big poster that came in the box "THE UNIT NEEDS TO BE ACTIVATED BEFORE USING". I called the number to activate it. Thirty minutes later it was working great.    The Second Time    After activating I decided to leave it on one channel to test it. I paused for a bit, I was able to rewind the show from the time I tuned into that channel (the unit is always recording so when you stop on a channel it records from the time you stopped on it). I figured a great way to avoid commercials by leaving the show on pause for three minutes and then fast forwarding. Just before the show ended I pressed the record button and it stored the entire show for me (from the time I tuned in).    The Goodies    You can set the unit to record ALL EPISODES of a show. This is a great way to make sure you never miss a show again. It records only the ones with a different description so you will not get repeat shows. The guide can be searched and can be viewed for over a week (unlike Bell ExpressVU). The PIP feature is great. I do not have a TV with PIP capabilities and I am a chronic channel surfer so this helps me get my fix. Stores up to fifty hours of shows on an 80GB hard drive.    The Badies    The unit is much louder then I expected. You can hear the hard drive grinding away if you have the TV off and are recording something (when the TV is on the sound is drowned out). It is very hot and it is big. Not having a way to connect another video source until the extra ports are updated. Only stores fifty hours of shows and has no easy way to connect it through FireWire to back-up the shows on a DVD-R drive (could do this on a home DVD recorder through the S-Video port).    The Bottom Line    It is a nice unit and it has done everything I wanted it to do so far. I already have a bunch of shows stored that I recorded last night. If you are a TV junkie like myself or hate sitting through commercials then renting one of these units is worth it. If you were planning on buying one I would recommend waiting until the HD version is out in a few months.   Related Links:    urlLink Rogers Cable    urlLink Scientific-Atlanta

      News came in last week that the Rogers PVR (SA8000) would be available for rent beginning February 11, 2004 (today). Sure enough it is available today but in limited quanities and not at every store. In Toronto, the Yonge &amp; Davisville location seemed to be the only store with any left after noon.   Thanks to my source at  urlLink digitalhomecanada.com  I was one of the lucky ones that got one. This is an exciting day for me and I hope I am not disappointed.   I will be hooking it up tonight and posting a review tomorrow.

      After painfully watching the torture that is the Grammy's I am feeling dizzy and lightheaded. That was the most boring show in the history of television. The saving grace of the whole show was Celine Dion looking like a fool singing when her mic was not on (and hearing the audio technicians talking over her).   Most of the acts were toned down. Sting played twice (a sign of how bad it really was). Christina Aguilera was over-dressed. Prince was there. After three hours of torture the show ended pretty cool with OutKast (the reason I kept watching).   I'm not wasting anymore space talking about it.

      Last nights episode had the guys and gals "re-shuffle" teams. This helped Nick stay on for another week but saw Kristi Frank, restaurant owner, get FIRED. As project leader Nick did an excellent job and Donald seems to really like him. The challenge was to buy low and sell high at a flea market. Nick's team made a profit of $600.00 - Kristi's team lost money. Donald seemed very disappointed at how bad Kristi did as leader and was even more disappointed when she didn't stand up for herself in the boardroom.   Heidi is becoming more of a bitch each week and I was surprised Donald didn't eat her in the boardroom. Tammy's "bling" comment to George Steinbrenner was out of line and she came across as a real idiot. George looked annoyed with her and Donald noticed. My biggest shock was Jessie - she is nuts (the bird feeding scene was classic). I really got the feeling last night that she is a dangerous person.   I think it is going to come down to Nick &amp; Katrina as the final two.

      My computer is fairly secure. I have Norton Internet Security running, I have ZoneAlarm w/ Web Filtering running and I have Windows XP's built-in firewall turned on. I do frequent Windows and virus updates. I also scan my system with Ad-Ware on a regular basis. My computer is in "stealh mode" according to online tests.   Sunday afternoon I got a virus. Everything was enabled when I get a ZoneAlarm message - "BargainBuddy is attempting to access the internet" - I of course click NO and run an Ad-Aware scan. Sure enough, a program called "BargainBuddy" had been installed (as well as many other spyware programs) and it was everywhere. I remove all the culprits and run a virus scan - nothing shows up. I restart the computer.   After restarting the computer it tries to connect to the internet right away. I click "Work Offline" and go to open "My Computer". The computer not only freezes but it uses up 100% of the resources in the system and crashes. I restart and try again. It does this everytime. I finally load it in "Safe Mode" and am able to access my files. In "Normal Mode" I am able to surf the internet (if I do not click anything else but IE) and that is all. I decide to reinstall Windows - this made it worse.   I have about 5GB of data I need to back-up. My External FireWire HD will not connect in "Safe Mode" so I am forced to install a secondary internal HD from another computer. After all that I am able to back-up my files and install a fresh copy of Windows. I want the makers of BargainBuddy to burn in hell for this.   The computer is back to normal. Still getting all my settings back in order which is a big pain. I am a little concerned about how this got onto my system in the first place. The common user would purchase all of this security software and think they were safe. This horrible experience has made me question Symantec's software (ZoneAlarm did block it from sending any of my information and accessing the internet). I think I will be purchasing McAfee as my virus scanner when my subscription is up.

       ** out of 5 stars    After being interrupted by the weekend events (RE: Lloyd Kaufman) we finally finished watching Cabin Fever.   I expected a lot out of this film. From what I read Eli Roth was a boy wonder in the horror genre. What a load of crap. First: when stealing from other films make it a little less obvious. Almost every shot looked like it was from a  Friday the 13th  or  Sleepaway Camp  film. Second: The movie starts out very slow and is quite boring until 40 minutes in. I really think a little more action in the beginning would have helped move the story along.   There is some great things in the movie that I applaud Mr. Roth for. There is a nice amount of nudity (which is making a comeback in the horror genre). When the "fever" sets in it there is some great gory moments. The crazy dog.   Sadly, there is even more wrong with the film that I shake my head in shame at. The character of Bert should have died in the first ten minutes of the film. This was the most annoying character I have ever seen in a horror film. The directors cameo was pointless. The reasoning behind the kid biting people should have been explained. The entire bunch of rednecks looked horrible and acted horrible. The cop - although funny at times - was just stupid.   The DVD for the film is decent. Lots of background and how it all came to be. Some shorts that Eli Roth made. A few other fun things. I would recommend the DVD to any fans of the film.

      Well I must say that Superbowl sucked.   The game itself was exciting but the commercials and half-time show sucked (the main reason I watch the Superbowl).   Janet's breast - which I barely noticed while watching it live - was the only thing interesting about the whole half-time. Whoever thinks Justin Timberlake is a good choice for a game that is mostly viewed by big sweety men makes me laugh.   What a waste of time.

      I only started watching The Sopranos recently. TMN replayed season 3 &amp; 4 in Canada before kicking off the new season. Season 3 really hooked me and 4 kept me wanting more.   Then season 5 started.   The first episode was ok. The two after that have been downright boring. I actually don't care if I miss it on Sunday night anymore. If it doesn't start to change soon I'm afriad I will never go back.   So what is the problem?   Tony and Carmela splitting up changed the show a lot. It seems to be drifting away from "family" situations which to me was the best part of the show.   The addition of the "Class of 2004" - these guys don't seem to fit in anywhere and really throw the show off balance. Even Steve Buscemi seems like a waste.   And finally - there is no one to root for or hate anymore. All the problems seem to have been resolved in season 4. Ralphie is dead. Christopher is clean. etc., etc.   Hopefully I'll still be watching at the end of the season to give a better review.

      There comes a time in a man's life when TV is not the most important thing (shocking I know) - this time has come for me.   I recently purchased a house with my fiancee and decided to cancel all of my cable services until we move - which means no more PVR!   Once a PVR has come into a man's home it becomes as important as the fridge or toilet. It has been just over a week now and I am starting to crack. Like a bad drug addiction I am craving my PVR! The first few days were ok - then I sat down to watch TV and nothing was there!   It will return once we move. Until then I will be drooling in the corner, rocking back and forth.

      What a boring show last night. Billy Crystal even seemed bored. No big surprises. No boobies falling out. Nothing to talk about really.    The Good Stuff    Will Ferrell and Jack Black putting lyrics to the "acceptance speech has gone on to long music"  Ben Stiller (dressed as Starsky) and Owen Wilson (not dressed as Hutch)  'The Barbarian Invasions' winning Best Foreign Film  Eugene Levy & Catherine O'Hara as Mitch &amp; Mickey for the performance from 'A Mighty Wind'    The Bad Stuff    The opening montage - boring.  Jim Carrey giving Blake Edwards the Life Achievement Award (what was up with that?)  Sean Penn's acceptance speech (felt bad for Bill)  Sofia Coppola winning for Best Original Screenplay (I really dislike her)

      Well I finally gave up on the iTunes Music Store and downloaded my first legal track today from Puretracks.com.   I e-mailed a PR person at Apple the other day about the Music Store opening in Canada and I got some junk generic DO_NOT_REPLY@APPLE.COM e-mail stating they cannot give out information, etc. I would not be so pissed if the PR person replied herself. Since she did not I feel Apple just doesn't seem to care about their users (Canadian users at least) and I am losing my faith in them.   Puretracks.com is a Canadian company. On average songs are .99 CDN. (although 'Float On' by Modest Mouse was $1.19). Albums are between $9.99 - $12.99 CDN. Because I am a Bell Sympatico member I get a discount (nice!).   I downloaded three songs which totaled 18MB - took about 2 minutes to download (you have to download a special downloader for your purchase). The files are Windows Media Files, 192kbps. They sound great. Before I even played one of the songs I tried converting it to an MP3 in iTunes - sure enough I got an error message. Because the files have a license attached I cannot convert them (but I can burn them to CD and import them into iTunes).   The selection on Puretracks.com is pretty good. A lot of Canadian artists and a lot of classic and recent hits. The layout is very similar to the iTunes Music Store which makes it easy to navigate.   Now about a month ago I tried using this service and hated it (I think I posted my distaste). Since Bell Sympatico opened a special version it feels different and I really enjoy it.   If you are Canadian I would say test it out and see if you like it. If you are a Sympatico user I would highly recommend it.

      That's right. I have a new comic up for the horrible new movie '13 Going on 30'.   Does not compete with 'Big' but tries.   Check the main page out at  urlLink http://www.sickandtwistedonline.com/  for the comic.   More comics coming very, very, soon.

      Well it looks like Comcast is firing most of the staff at  urlLink TechTV .   This is really sad news as I have loved this channel and watched it for the last two years on a daily basis.   I hope they keep Leo and the Screensavers staff at the new station. Maybe X-Play will make it but I think Call for Help, Tech Live and Fresh Gear will be shutdown.   Thanks a lot Comcast.

      Why is it that the iTunes music store is still not available in Canada?   Napster 2.0 is opening in Canada this summer (how did they beat Apple?). I'm worried they are going to taint the market and people are not going to download from them. This might look bad and Apple will never open its store to us.   I for one have no interest in using Napster 2.0 and will not support them.   If every Canadian reading this sends a message to Apple telling them we want to buy music from them they might listen.   Even though we are so close to America it seems like we are so far away sometimes.

      I have been using iChat AV on my Apple for about a month now and haven't really had anyone to chat with (mostly jumping from chatroom to chatroom). A majority of friends and family only have PC's and AIM just doesn't cut it, so they use MSN Messenger. iChat and MSN Messenger are not compatible. I hate using Messenger and refuse to install it on my Apple.   With that said - if anyone out there wants to gab on iChat (or AIM) my username is "ibmckechnie" without the quotes. If anyone knows any tech or movie chatrooms that are good PLEASE send them to me.

      I just signed up and started using my GMail account. So far so good. Signing up was easy being a Blogger.com member. Although I could not use Safari on my Apple because it is not supported yet. Had to go with IE on my PC instead.     What is GMail?    GMail is a new e-mail system run by Google. You get 1GIG of storage and it is FREE! The catch is that a computer (not a human) scans your messages and uses keywords to alter the ads on the right side of the screen (kinda like when you do a Google search). They state that NO HUMAN AT GOOGLE will ever read your e-mail and that your messages are still private.     How is it to use?    If you don't mind the above privacy issue then GMail is great. It is FAST - compared to Hotmail or Yahoo! it loads at the speed of light. This could be because it is in the beta testing stages and not everyone can have an account yet. . It is easy on the eyes - not so much going on the screen (I haven't even seen an ad yet - again could be because it is still in beta testing stages).     What does it offer?    The 1GIG of storage for FREE is amazing, the ability to Google your storage to find messages faster is very cool, but the best feature I have found is replying to a message or receiving a reply to a message. It loads like a chat screen or a messageboard (see my second screenshot). Very, very cool.     Do you recommend signing up?    Yes and no. If you have an issue with them scanning your e-mail then stay far away. If you need a secondary account or an account for all your messageboard use and you need lots of space then I think you will love it and you should sign-up right away.     How do I get an account?    The bad news - you can't (unless you have a Blogger.com account). The good news is that you can be notified of when you can sign-up by visiting  urlLink www.gmail.com .   A couple of screenshots below.    urlLink Screenshot #1    urlLink Screenshot #2    If you want to send me an e-mail to my GMail account it is bmckechnie@gmail.com

      Finally season 5 is starting to feel like The Sopranos!   The last three episodes have been some of the best.   Steve Buscemi is finally starting to fit in. Most of the other "Class of 2004" characters have disappeared and the "family" is working out their issues. If they keep this up they could turn this season from the worst season into the best season yet.

      After 25 1/2 years I am moving out of Toronto.   My girlfriend and I have purchased a big old house about an hour from the city. I will be commuting for work everyday so I am not going to be in shock or anything.   The prices in Toronto are crazy. Our one bedroom, one bathroom 800 sq. ft. house in the beaches sold for almost the same price as the house we bought. The house we bought is over twice the size and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms.   With this new house comes lots of ideas of how to make it a smart home. I want a server/distribution closet in the basement that is capable of whole home audio and video. I plan to eventually build a home theatre. I am going to install a couple of security cameras and motion sensors and I want the entire house networked.   In a Dilbert like attempt to get reader feedback I want to hear WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU COULD? What else should I plan on doing? It can be the craziest suggestion or a simple suggestion. Any product recommendations are very welcomed. And anyone who has first hand experience send me your stories, pictures, etc.   All e-mail should be sent to:  urlLink bmckechnie@gmail.com    I will post some of the ideas on my blog unless told not to.

      I have been very busy packing my house the last few weeks (more on that in another post) and have not had a chance to post anything.   Today I finally took a break to catch up on some news and just found out that G4TechTV Canada is going to be bringing Leo Laporte back to TV!   For more details check out Leo's site at  urlLink leo.typepad.com    I hate the new format of G4TechTV and hopefully this will make it better for us viewers (in Canada at least).

      For the past few months I have been playing with  urlLink Apple's Soundtrack software  in order to create some end credit and DVD menu music for my projects at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have actually made a few songs that I think&nbsp;sound pretty cool and I want to share them with the world (or the two people who might stumble over my blog).   I can only post one track at a time because I do not have enough Web space (I really need to get a proper Web host - any recommendations?). After about one week I will take the first track down and add another.   Title:  urlLink Lone Sailor Part 3   Genre: Electronic  Time: 1:36  Format: MP3  File Size: 2.2MB    &nbsp;  Clicking&nbsp;the link will load the track in a new browser window.&nbsp;If you would prefer to download it follow these steps: On a PC right click and SAVE AS&nbsp;on a MAC&nbsp;hold down CONTROL and click.&nbsp;   Give me some feedback and let me know if you dig it or hate it.&nbsp;

      Well I decided that transfering all the old comics to the blog was too much work (being way lazy).   I decided to change the official Criticize This! site to point to the blog and set-up a page for just comics (known as the comics archive page or CAP).   All new comics will be posted here in the blog as well as on the comics&nbsp;archive page. &nbsp;  Find the comics archive page here:  urlLink http://www3.sympatico.ca/bmckechnie

      Up here in Canada we do not get the&nbsp;Fox News Channel (yet). I have seen the channel while visiting the U.S. though and from what I have seen I think they are a joke. I still wish we got the channel - the more opinions on the news the better.   With that said, when I heard that Michael Moore was going on the O'Reilly Factor&nbsp;this week&nbsp;I almost fell over. I am a Michael Moore fan. I believe in what he is doing - yes it is only HIS perspective but at least he is getting off his ass and showing the world. If a Republican made a documentary bashing John Kerry or Bill Clinton I would watch it as well.   Since we do not get&nbsp;the channel&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to wait to&nbsp;watch it online. It was actually a&nbsp;pretty decent&nbsp;interview (one of the better O'Reilly segments I have seen).&nbsp;I still do not like Bill O'Reilly (many reasons in Canada to not like him) but at least he let Moore speak (and ask&nbsp;questions).   Follow&nbsp;this link to read the transcript and see the&nbsp;footage:&nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,127236,00.html

      So it appears that one of the characters on The Simpsons is gay and there is going to be a same sex marriage.   This is big news today - there is actually a WHOLE page dedicated to it in the Toronto Star (not the Entertainment section either).   It would be too obvious if it was Smither's (as all radio stations are talking about this morning). I think it is Rev. Lovejoy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Principal Skinner&nbsp;or&nbsp;Barney&nbsp;and Moe.

      There is something very addicting about Coffee-mate and I believe there is evil forces behind it.   I have been using it at the office for the last few weeks because we do not have a fridge to store real cream anymore. At first I was like BLAH! GAG! BLAH! But I choked it down to get my coffee "fix". Three weeks later and I am spooning the white stuff into my mug like a junkie.   It is disgusting. I know it is disgusting. It is also very bad. I can feel my heart slowing down with every sip I take. Like a junkie with a crack addiction I just don't care and I NEED IT!   My conspiracy theory about Coffee-mate is that they make it look like cocaine on purpose. This makes you joke about being addicted to it in the lunchroom with your co-workers. Once the joke is out the seed is planted in your brain that you are addicted to it. The bad taste is then covered by your faux addiction and you keep drinking it not even realizing what you are drinking anymore.   I think I'm going to start Coffee-mate Anonymous before everyone in my office is hooked.

        urlLink     This is my puppy-in-law Jackson. He is staying with us for a couple of weeks while my in-laws are away. I am using him to test out a Canon S500 digital camera (I think he wants to be a model because he likes posing for the camera!). I'll be reviewing the Canon&nbsp;S500 in about a week.&nbsp;So far it seems to be a great little camera.   This is my first photo post and WOW! it was damn easy. I used the free software Hello like Google recommends and it pretty much did all the work for me. It resized the photo, hosted it and let me post it with this text on my blog right from the software. I did have to edit the post afterwards to get the photo centered (picky designer in me).&nbsp;   &nbsp;   urlLink   &nbsp;

His delivery was brilliant.   The script, the acting - even the Mummy - worked so well that I am going to sit down and watch this movie again and again and again.   Rent or buy it today!

      After moving an hour away from Toronto I realized something..MOVING SUCKS!   We had a small house in the city - not too much stuff it seemed. We rented a 14 ft. U-Haul which I complained about being TOO BIG and a WASTE OF MONEY! Well my friends, that U-Haul was full and the house was NOT EMPTY!   I am the master mover. I have moved over a dozen times since highschool. This move has killed me and I never want to move again. We are still moving stuff two weeks after we moved! Where did we hide everything? We only had one closet!   Hopefully we will not moving for another 10 years.

      I just checked the Apple Canada Web site and saw the iPod Mini is now available to order. I was excited until I saw the price - $349 CDN! Let me say that again - $349 CANADIAN DOLLARS!!!   Are the execs at Apple smoking crack? Why would anyone pay $349 for 4GB of space when you can get the 15GB iPod for $50 extra! Big deal that is not pink or blue - it is going in your pocket or bag anyways.   I would not pay more then $199.99 CDN for this and until Apple lowers the price I am asking everyone in Canada to protest this stupidity. That is what this is - STUPIDITY.   Apple has still not given us the iTune's Music Store but keeps pushing overpriced MP3 players.   If they don't wise up soon they will not have any market left in Canada.

      This is mainly for people who reside in Cambridge, Guelph and Brantford (Ontario, Canada).  I have started a petition to get the GO Train service extended to the above mentioned cities. It seems like everyone I speak to in my new neighborhood commutes to the big smoke (Toronto) and it would be well worth it for GO Transit to realize this.  If you reside in any of these cities (or close by) please come sign the petition.   urlLink www.PetitionOnline.com/gotrain

      What the hell is wrong with Apple Canada? I was just on  urlLink www.apple.ca  trying to find information on their instant loan program and it is gone. No links, no info, no press release. A week ago it was online and now it is like it never existed.  After searching apple.ca and Googling for thirty minutes I decided to contact someone at Apple Canada. I guess they never heard of e-mail because all I get is 1-800 numbers. I don't want to call, I want to type and send. The best I could find was a feedback form for apple.com!  I truly believe Apple hates Canada. We are still waiting for the iTunes Music Store to open, there is no support for apple.ca and it seems that they do not release information to our media.  I love the products and have supported them for many years but this is getting crazy. If I had this many problems trying to get information and was a new user who did not know much about Apple I would be clicking to Dell Canada or HP Canada pretty fast.  Someone from Apple Canada must realize this! Speak up before it is too late!

      Yesterday I decided to go to the Apple trailer site instead of writing the review for the Canon digital camera (still coming I promise).  Here are a few trailers I recommend viewing:   urlLink Team America: World Police  From the creators of South Park comes a political film starring puppets. Trailer available in full screen size as well as the regular small, medium and large. Full screen is not recommended unless DSL or Cable is being used.   urlLink A Dirty Shame  It's been four years since John Waters gave us a film and A Dirty Shame looks nasty. First it has got Johnny Knoxville (from Jackass fame) and then it has got an NC-17 rating. Could Mr. Knoxville recreate the famous dog poop scene from Pink Flamingo's? We'll have to wait to see.   urlLink Meet The Fockers  I liked Meet The Parents and adding Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand (as the Mother Focker) to the mix can't hurt the laughs. Looks promising.   urlLink The Grudge  An american remake of the Japanese horror film Ju-On (see below). Same director as Ju-On but produced by Sam Raimi and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar. I just hope the movie is half as freaky as this trailer because I'm still creeped out by it.   urlLink Ju-On  Original Japanese film that The Grudge is based on (see above).   urlLink Christmas With The Kranks  Call me crazy but I laughed at this trailer. I know this movie is not going to be as funny as it looks but the trailer is worth viewing. Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis star.  Check out  urlLink www.apple.com/trailers  for more trailers.

      I just heard the new Green Day track "American Idiot" and all I can say is WOW!  It is a very catchy tune but the political message behind it is what makes it impressive. Green Day's music has never been anything more then punk-pop songs since they made it big with Dookie. It is nice to see them going back to their punk roots and actually writing songs with messages (it still sounds punk-pop though).  This is my three and half cents on the song,  urlLink CLICK HERE  to take a listen and tell me what you think.

      A few weeks ago there was a  urlLink story all over the news  about this tourist in Australia who bought a suitcase for $36.00 and found all this "rare" Beatles memorabilia and "lost" recordings inside. The said findings were to be worth thousands.  Turns out the "lost" recordings were CDRs with some bootleg concert material and nothing "rare" was actually in the loot. I say he probably got his $36.00 worth.   Here is a  urlLink follow-up story from yesterday's Globe &amp; Mail .

It is almost like using a pencil and paper but a lot more touchy. I will have to keep practicing with it.  The digital camera review will be up later tonight or tomorrow morning with some more pics I took over the weekend. I guess I will write up a review of the  urlLink Wacom Tablet  in a few days as well.

      People have been asking about the movie that is mentioned in my bio I am giving away for FREE. Since I got a few e-mails about it I've decided to post some info about the film and the how to get a copy.  The movie is called P.O.V - it is a feature length horror/thriller/experimental film. I was the producer/co-director. After the film was finished it received some good reviews (Fangoria Magazine, Rue Morgue Magazine,  urlLink FilmThreat.com , etc.) and won Best Supporting Actor in a B-Movie at the 2002  urlLink B-Movie Film Festival . I really thought the film had potential so I decided to have 1000 copies on VHS produced and self release the film. We got a handful in video stores and sold a few online and then sales stopped. I still have 700 copies sitting in my office taunting me each day. The loan I took to get the copies made was recently paid and I don't need the cash now. What I do need is feedback (and to get rid of 700 VHS tapes that are taunting me).  This is the part I hate to mention. On average it is $3.00 US to ship a copy anywhere in North America - so if you want a copy and live in North America I have to charge you $3.00 US to ship it (I take PayPal). If you really want a copy and can't afford the shipping &amp; handling or don't use PayPal e-mail me and we can make arrangements.  After you watch the movie  PLEASE GIVE ME FEEDBACK . This is the important part of getting it for FREE. You can rate it on imdb.com, e-mail me directly, post a comment on my blog or write a review for your own site - as long as I hear you hated it, loved it, whatever.  If you want a copy e-mail me at  urlLink bmckechnie@gmail.com   For more information on the film check out the  urlLink IMDb.com listing .
