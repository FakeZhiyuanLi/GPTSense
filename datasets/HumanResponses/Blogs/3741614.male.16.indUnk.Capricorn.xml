      Yes, I am continuing the awful series for my fandom of  Spider-Man 2 , but, hey, it's got to pay off somehow. Anyway, in this edition of the update, we'll list things like why I love Spider-Man so much... Not! Now, I know I'm boring, but I'm not that boring. Plus, I just got home from work and most people know exactly how that goes. A few sarcastic jokes here and there. Falling flat out on your face and hoping nobody was looking. And, last, but not least, rolling into the sack only to remember you left something on downstairs. Yes, that's about the night for me tonight, but enough about me - lets get to the "Spider-Man-Fandom-Thing".  Everybody of course knows that the first Spider-Man movie grossed about $820 Million Dollars world-wide, and the new movie is all about upping the ante in action, story, and revenue sales. Personally, I wish I could be first in line for the 7:00 show on Wednesday (that I know will be packed), but as fate would have it, I just found out that I have to work on Wednesday way past 7:00. Bah, I'll just see the 10:00 show or something. Moving on, we've got the villian in Doctor Otto Octavius (Doc Ock) with four arms welded directly into his spine which has somehow turned him crazy (or maybe that's the radiation talking). Anyway, he gets in an accident and gets all mad-scientisty. And that's where the action begins. I couldn't think of any other villian for the second Spider-Man movie than Doc Ock, or someone who could do it as well as Alfred Molina has done.  That's about all I've got for this update.  Spider-Man 2  still has 4 days until it comes out and I'm trembling with anticipation. TREMBLING, I TELL YOU!

       Omega Championship Wrestling (OCW) is in it's tweaking days as we speak. Re-opening after almost a year on the back-burner, this popular e-fed is still in need of wrestlers. I know the owners personally and I can promise that the good times will continue to roll from beginning to end (although I hope there isn't one). There isn't a set date for opening yet, but, as always, it is coming soon. My guess is the first week of July or so.  If you're interested in an e-fed that will bring in the talent and competition that real-world wrestling should every single week, then head on down to  urlLink Omega Championship Wrestling . If you want to get an idea about the people behind the wrestlers, head over to the  urlLink OCW Boards . They may be a little scary at first, but you'll get used to it.  Sure this post may just be a senseless cry for talent, but if it's out there, then I'm sure I've done my good deed for the day. ...Plus, I felt the need to find fresh blood. (evil grin)

      Yes, I may have a guy's perspective on the movie "The Notebook", and, yes, I may not have payed attention to the whole movie, but I've still got to admit that deep, deep down, this movie still was about as tear-jerking for me as a wet noodle gone dry. It's basically about a love-affair between two people that's broken up, put back together, then broken up, then put back together, then given a choice, almost broken up and put back together finally. Unless that's the kind of movie you're looking for I suggest you don't go. Personally, I think if I had gotten into it more, I may have liked it more, but the lack of plot got to me not even half-way through. Of course, that's just my review of it.  By the way, speaking of movies,  Spider-Man 2  is only 5 days away. I'm shaking with anticipation... No, really, I am.

      7 Days Until The  Spider-Man 2  Movie.  It looks as if I'm going to start a daily update on the Spider-Man 2 Movie, as it has been called " the best superhero movie ever made ". How, as a whole, do you guys that blog around do you think Spider-Man ranks in the heirarchy of superheros? Basically, how does Spider-Man compare to Superman, Batman, Birdman, Space Ghost - whoever you can think of?

      Well, look what we have here... Kevin finally found himself a little ol' blog. Welcome to Kevin's Beat-Em-Down Blog where I'll talk about Wrestling, E-wrestling, some e-federations that I'm in, and whatever else pops into my little ol' head.   Well, what are you waiting for? Let's get started.   First time:   Yes, I admit this is my first time using a blog. Anybody have any ideas to improve/comment about it, don't hesitate to mention it... Except Jack. Jack, you know you're a post whore at heart. ;) I guess that's all for my first official post. See ya!  Kevin

      Well, we've finally come to it. I've finally seen it, every single frame. The action was intense, the romance had its good points, and the reveals blew my mind. My one question: How exactly are they going to follow that up?   Spider-Man 2  gave me goosebumps, filled my heart, opened possibilities, and left me wanting more. OKay, that may sound a little eccentric, but it's true: Spider-Man 2 was as amazing as the character it has developed inside of it. If nobody understands that, then I think I've done my job justice. Now, I'll try not to blow the whole movie for people who haven't seen it yet, but there's a lot to cover and a small amount of blog on my hands.  Starting with the opening credits, I was pumped to watch it. I of course snuck in food with my friends just so I wouldn't waste money on the consession stand and had Junior Mints already in my mouth. The story is, again, still about a girl. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is still in extreme circumstances all thanks to her love for Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) comes into the picture and, due to an unfortunate accident with a renewable resource gone awry, happens upon losing control of the four mechanical arms attached to his spine(or they take control of him). Well, he's determined to get that renewable source going, even if he takes the whole city down with him. That's the basic gist of it and the action, romance, sob story and triumph all form around it.  The special and sound effects were outstanding, definitely rising above the first film. The clanks, the claws, the climbs - everything was done to a "T". The fact that they may have toned down a few things to keep this film in the PG-13 field astounds me. Personally, I can't wait to see it again. Too bad I've got a hole in my pocket the size of the Grand Canyon. Sigh...  Basically, this is the kind of movie anyone can watch. Sure, it may have some shocks, menace, and out-of-control scenes, but, all-in-all, its a movie that you just can't put down. That is, unless you're about the most despressing person on Earth, but I won't name any names. You come out of that theater with a bigger sense of pride...that or at least hand just itching to shoot web into the sky and lift you into oblivion. Sure, it's a bit soppy and boring to hear, but I can't help it! Now, go see the movie, aight?

      As it turns out, the movie that I've been tossed into a straightjacket for constantly (truthfully, I have) came out yesterday. Not only did I not post about it (hey, are you a true fan or a poser) [No comments, okay] (poser) but, in the time that I spent not blogging, I didn't even get to go and see the movie. Yes, fans, I have had to wait two days to see it with my friends who obviously don't know how seriously I want to go see  Spider-Man 2 . Sure, I could just go and see it on my own, but then what fun would it be to walk out of the theater with no one to talk to except the wall. It's not much fun, believe me.  In other news, it's raining. Yes, rain, a beautiful thing. Lighting, a nasty little shocker. I'm sitting inside with NOTHING TO DO (hint, hint). I might as well go see the movie tonight, but something just keeps holding me back. Hopefully no one will spoil the movie or its ending (BIG hint, hint). Today would make about the seventh week in a row that I've made a permanent acquaintance with a little person of mine I'd like to call the TV - I get to shout at it and it doesn't shout back (perfect relationship).  Even greater news,  OCW  (Omega not Online) is again close to its re-opening! (cheer, praise) Josh Allen and Andy Murray, owners of the fed, are I am proud to say very good owners and should keep Omega going strong for as long as possible. Who knows, maybe Kevin Heat could capture the World Title and be on the Main Event scene for a while... I can only hope. (sigh, relief not flatulence) Some of the other great faces in this wrestling scene happen to be Jake Navaja, Phantom, Goldie, Jason Stone and Top Dog. Some new notables to the Omega scene are myself (in this character), Henry Illision Tippyunder(big fan of him), Terrance Black, Richard Price, Joey Peyton, and Ozric Mortimer. There is Jack Sullivan too, but he isn't really worth mentioning(post whore). It is rumored that the first title to be given a winner will be the OCW World Heavyweight Title. Whether that will happen may just depend on if Jin Royale, Omega's last World Champ, returns to the federation. As of yet, there has been no talk of Jin returning. Will he make a big return that will fool anybody looking for the World Title? Who knows? Hopefully, real talent will ensue and  OCW  will prosper. If anybody reading this wants to know what its about or want to join, I've got the hook-up:  urlLink http://www.fwrestling.com/host/ocwhq/   Well, that sums up just about all I've been holding in for the past few days. Hope you enjoyed it. I would end with a quote or something, but its clear if you read this all the way through that sense isn't something that runs deep in me. Keep it cool and peace out!

      Yes, this is the first post I've done in almost a whole month, I know. I've got a few topics to discuss,  and not a lot of sanity left in me.  First off, my roleplaying status has been...horrible. Yep, I have officially resigned Kevin Heat from ICWF as he has died one too many times (not actually died, but been beaten and he can't get up is sufficient). Kevin had a future there when I first started, but lately he's becoming a bit jaded and I think I may take him out of OCW also. It's getting harder to easily do two people, especially in a federation of such prestige. Richard Price, my other character, looks like he may have a future if I ever get him roleplaying and segment..ing... Anyway, keep your fingers and toes crossed and I may be able to keep them both, but it's not likely.  Next, last night I went to see the movie I've been dying to see for such a long while - no, not "The Village" which I heard wasn't worth it. " Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle " was the comedy of choice and it was funny as hell. The two leads, John Cho and Kal Penn, look like they have a real future, especially when their able to laugh at themselves so much in this movie. It's basically about two pot smokers - one an anal-retentive business man, and one an A-list slacker - who, after smoking a whole bag of pot, get the munchies for some White Castle. It's bad enough that the White Castle not too far away was torn down, but that they are so close and yet so far from a 24-Hour Open White Castle in Cherry Hill. From there, their epic quest for White Castle mini-burgers and "inner peace" begins, stringing together an escaped cheetah, a hot Hispanic girl, and some "totally extreme" punks that just won't go away. Believe me, it's worth seeing.  Finally, like the sands in the hourglass, times change and school is coming back. Maybe not your school, but my school is coming back in a week or so. I'm sad to say that sooner rather than later, I'm going to have to hit the books and pound the pavement for my three hardest classes. The great thing about them all is that I have them one after the other first semester. Isn't that a coincidence? My only refuge is that I have last period off to rest up and slack off. Sure, I shouldn't really bore you with my schedule, but, hey, you have a right to know, right? All I ask is that you stay with me just for a second.  Well, that's about all I have to talk about right now. Hopefully, I'll be more interesting as the days go on. You can never tell. Oh well, I'm sleepy. I'm gone. Night.
