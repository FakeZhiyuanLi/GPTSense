      Yesterday 2 friends slept over and we had a "pijamada", was cool. Stayed up untill 4am talking. This weekend is gonna be very quiet.. just gonna spend it with friends... maybe tomorrow sunday we'll go to a mountain called "Chipinque" to hike... too bad I don't have a camera. I'm kinda sleepy now I didn't get to sleep much... so I think I'll take a nap.

      So the interview went really well, I must admit I was a bit nervous at the beginning. I was told he likes to dress formal but to my surprise he arrived wearin a beach shirt (Hawaii style) and suddenly I felt over-dressy. Anyways we spoke for about an hour in his office, topics ranged from the situation in the middle east... to Arab immigration to Mexico... then he gave me a copy of one of his books that he wrote titled "Arab Immigration in Mexico" I also found out that he lives about 2 blocks away from me here in Las Brisas, so we're sort of "neighbours". He invited me to go visit his house and meet his family tomorrow evening... but I'm not sure if I will go. He also asked me to go next tuesday to one of his classes... and talk about anything related to the middle east... also answer a few questions that the students might have... which is kinda cool with all the free time I have. So all in all... it went well! :)

      Yep! when it comes to Lebanon... if you don't have social connections with "people in places"... you don't get anywhere.... and turns out we're not the only ones... In a few hours I'm going to meet a somewhat influential man I'm told.. in the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey. He's 60ish, Algerian and the Coordinator of Internacionalización de la División de Humanidades y Ciencias Sociales -- whatever the hell that's supposed to mean! I spoke with him on the phone a few days ago and he sounded a bit nostalgic to speak in Arabic. Hope this meeting goes well.

      Ok it's 11:15 pm, my mechanical energy consumed, so here comes the Brain. Something just happened right now, inside of me, in that big heart of mine: I let go....... when you see somebody happy, if you truly love them... you'd let them go! if you don't it's selfishness... The game, the show is over... did you notice I like to use ...... a lot? Anyways, I'll be here... and so will they... and time will tell.

      I took the dog to the park, and it just occured to me now that throughout the whole ordeal I didn't stop once to think about anything. I am becoming more mechanical day after day, and just concentrating on daily chores, which is excellent. Slowly regaining my motivation to better my condition after years of overclocked brain activity -- I always have too many questions -- but hey who am I to figure out the answers just using my brain, I figured going through life... day by day... would eventually answer some of those questions, so no need to stop the whole train... just to look at the freakin map!

      I'm not really in the mood to write anything right now... I tried and tried but nothing came out... maybe it's emptiness that I'm feelin or just the fact that I'm in a phase that I call "The Crocodile Phase", is blocking my attempts to dig deep and write something insightful, to open a small window into my real world. I'll leave you with this thought: The best things in life are simple... I'm not.
