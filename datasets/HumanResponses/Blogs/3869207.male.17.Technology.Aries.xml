      Well, I was looking through yesterday's Desmoines Register again, and I noticed on page 3 a full color photo of Alex Ingham at the DNC in Boston.&nbsp; Who is Alex Ingham?&nbsp; Besides being a small time pretty boy&nbsp;and&nbsp;apparent liberal&nbsp;schmuck ;) Alex also was my room mate in New&nbsp;York while&nbsp;I was at the&nbsp;Invitational Academic Workshop at West Point.&nbsp; Here's the pics to prove it, courtesy of the Register and my now fixed, but still&nbsp;broken laptop, which had all my vacation photos on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Desmoines RegisterÂ©

      Ladies and gentlemen, today I made my parents proud by being immortalized in history by 17 words made in passing reference to my role as an eagle in the Desmoines Register today. Here they are:       Impressive no? Hahaha well maybe not, but I was still impressed. In other news, I had a full set of physical examinations today to see if I'm qualified for West Point (the college I'm trying to get into). The high point of that was probably when the doctor was finishing the *cough* *cough* hernia check, he told to me bend over, and I swear to god my life flashed before my eyes. Luckily for me, the doc had been doing the hernia exam without gloves(eeew), so he passed on the rectal examination(I have no idea what he was actually looking for back there). I have to give my guardian angel props for that one. Other exciting events of the day include finally getting my laptop back from repair. Unfortunately though, the genius's down at the repair facility forgot to fedex the power adapter with the laptop, so all I have is one battery charge before its useless again. I called them up and gave them a piece of my mind, so hopefully they get on the stick and next-day air that sucker up to me tomorrow. Until then, I'm out!

      hah.  Today Ragbrai (Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, this is one of the largest organized cross-country bike rides in the world.  About 15,000 bikers cross Iowa from west to east) passed through my hometown Eagle Grove.  I know the city council co-chairman pretty well, and him and myself greeted Ragbrai'ers as they rode into town.  The catch was that we were 20 feet up in the air, in a huge nest, dressed like bald eagles.  (you can stop laughing now)  So anyway, I got my picture taken today hundreds of times (no joke), and even once by a Desmoines Register photographer who came up into the nest to get a picture.  We had an air horn hooked up in the nest, so every once in a while we'd blow the horn to get peoples attention.  The whole shebang warranted responses from the bikers such as "WHAT THE F*&%???"  "That away Hawkeyes!!"  "DUDE there's an eagle up in the tree,  KAAAKAAA KAAA KAAA" "Hahaha way to go!" "Work that thang, eagle boy!!"(I did the funky chicken for the bikers from time to time) .  Early in the morning (we started at like 6:00) there was one lady just moseying along, and we waited until she was even on the road with our tree before we sounded the air horn.  She replied with a nice and loud "GOD D$%%IT!!" which make us laugh.  Anyway, it was fun, and having my picture taken that many times might have been flattering had I not been wearing an enormous purple eagle costume...  So after that was over, I headed over to Clarion to work at the video store there because they were short of help.  I was running a little late, but I really wanted to some dinner before I went to work, so I stopped at hardee's.  It just so happened that I picked the same time to eat as a large family of Hispanics, who ordered over $40 in fast food (that's a freaking large amount of food), and took half an hour ordering it >:(   But, its all good, and I'm back home now.  That's all I got for today, so peace out till next time!

      Aye! I've been at the Buena Vista leadership enrichment camp for the past 5 days, so I finally got a free minute or two publish a post.&nbsp; Its been really cool up here in Storm Lake so far, the kids I'm here with are  really  cool, and we've been having a good time.&nbsp; We do stuff like go classes about leadership, do team building activities, and yesterday we even went to boji bay together.&nbsp; I'm really enjoying it here, but it'll be good to get back too, so until then, &nbsp;peace!

      Hey sorry I haven't posted in a while, but my Internet Explorer has been going a bit nutty the past day or two because of some very nasty spyware that refused to die.  Finally, with the help of about 3 or 4 programs, I finally got the bug flushed out of my system, and I'm feeling quite relieved now.  I swear, if I ever come face to face with one of the developers of these adware programs, there may be one less schmuck crawling about on the face of the earth (and I am NOT refering to myself thank you!).  So anyway, I'm back and tomarrow I'll get back to the swing of posting and stuff.  Till then, adios!

      Tyler passed away this morning.  It really hits you hard when the finality of it all just sinks in.  Tyler had his whole life in front of him, and now there's nothing left but an empty shell.  It wasn't his fault, he didn't deserve it, but he's gone.  The worst part is, I don't think he was saved.  I went to classes with him, wrestled side by side with him, I went to his house a few times, but I don't think I ever really witnessed to him.  Sure, I might have made some side comments here and there that could have hinted my beliefs to him, but I never really took it much farther than that.  It doesn't take more than an instant for life to turn upside-down, and leave those still standing with questions and what-if's.  What-if's won't bring him back though, so we need to deal with the what-now's.  So here's to Tyler, the fighter and friend.  I'll miss ya.

      Hey, I was just gettin ready to leave to watch my lil sis do a 4-H presentation at the fair and thought I'd stop and scribble down whatever in on my mind.  umm.......well nothing deep is swimming around in my brain right now, so I think I'll do the blog thing again later tonight after I'm done at work.  Till then peace out!

      I went to the county fair today and saw all the sites.  Pretty much the same as years before, but different people, and I am less involved than I used to be becuase I don't do the 4-H thing any more.  The fair board was able to book a carnival this year, which is pretty fun, except for a couple angry carnies that yelled at my friends and I for trying to get our money's worth at those stupid coin drop, pusher, prizes drop games.  Heh then going home trying to get out of the parking lot, I was just sitting in my parked car minding my own business when out of the blue, a telephone pole come flying through the lot and nearly takes off my side-view mirror.  Well...maybe it didn't happen exactly like that, but seriously, that chainsaw artist guy aught to teach to stupid poles a lesson ...

      I gotta tell ya,  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang  is a high quality movie.  Seriously, when you are feeling overwhelmed by the waves of white trash scumbags entering your store, simply slip in a copy of  Chitty  and let the soothing melodies like  Truly Scrumptious  serenade you into a state of apathy, where you don't really care whether or not the half-drunk, wife beating, cracker is slapping around his ten mangy little kids.  So in other news, I got paid today, which always makes me smile, unless of course you just recently got back from vacation and have very few hours so that your check is miniscule...but on the bright side, that one paycheck probably adds up to more than most families in Somalia make in a year, plus I have daily meals and a home to live in so I should probably be a bit more thankful.

      This morning I drug myself out of bed to go to lifting which was, well, lifting as usual (I had Spud and Rice as partners).  I would like to say that aside from his smelly odor and occasional idiotic interjections, Nick Rice isn't a bad kid, but he just gets a bad rap from other kids who are looking for somebody to pick on.  People need to lay off of Nick and find someone else to pick on, someone else who really sucks at life like.....ehh, better not finish this thought.  So after lifting I was just kinda sleepily driving down Commercial on my way home, and on the edge of the street, right in front of First State Bank was a golden retriever.  The retriever was going crazy makin babies with this black mutt right there in plain view of all the cars.  Completely inappropriate :P  You know your life is getting boring when you start talking about dogs...nevermind. Anyway I went home and took a 4 or so hour nap on this really comfortable recliner in the living room, so now I'm feelin quite rested :D

      Well, it sounds like Tyler might not make it, and that sucks to even think about.  He was always an  optimist, telling the team that we can beat these guys if we want it, talking about what he was going to  do with his life after high school, or joking about as assignment in class.  His smile found its way out on a regular basis, and it's easy to picture his grin.  I don't want to see you go Tyler, so tonight my thoughts and prayers go out to you...

      hmm...another exciting morning for me.  I got up late this morning (finally got a full 8 hours of sleep because I went to bed before 2:00 last night :D) and took a shower, got dressed.  Then I headed into town to talk to Carlson so he could give me the email address of this weasel I've been trying to track down.  The guy I'm trying to find hired me about a month back to take pictures for a basketball camp in FD.  He promised to pay me $75 bucks a session, and since I went twice, there should have been 150 in green coming my way.  Unfortuantly after I left for my last vacation the *#$@!%% guy vanished off the face of the earth.  Anyway, hopefully I'll finally track him down...  So in other news, I somehow got stuck working today on what was suposed to be my day off.  That was cool, but I could probably use the money anyway becuase I havn't been around much recently. However...I did kinda wanted to go see that new movie King Arthur with the boys tonight.

      I got this new blog thing aye so I'm like trying to express myself.  Some of you people might not like it, but really if thats the way you feel about it, you can just take off.  Got it aye?  So anyway, I'm like trying to improve my "communication skills" aye.  So if you have something to say about that, you can just press the little comment button below aye.  By the way I watched Strange Brew for the first time today, and that's like a really good movie aye!

      Aye aye!  Summers almost over, so I'm trying to squeeze as much laziness, fun, and other activities as I can into this last week or two of freedom. Yesterday my family went up to Sioux City to see the President, Laura and the VP. That was really cool, and we got floor tickets so I got within about 10 ft. of the president, but the mass of people kept me from actually shaking his hand. That was spiffy though, so I was glad I went. I also got my senior pic proofs back the other day, which turned out well enough, but David, the photographer who took them, threatened to tie my hands together and drag me behind a car for several hours if I attempted to reproduce any of the proofs, so I better not post any of them on the blog (well maybe those weren't his words, but he made it vitally clear that I wasn't to be copying the pics). Soooooo, thats all I got for now (all i  have  for now, for the english teachers out there). I'll leave you with a pic of the man himself at the convention. I'm out!

      Well I'm back - haven't posted in a few days because of a computer problem that can be attributed to a system file glitch that prevented me from booting into windows, which was what i needed to do to fix the glitch. Its all good now though, so my computer is back and I'm online again.   I've been running around a lot lately, like up to the grand opening of the jordan creek mall in Desmoines, which was quite interesting/expensive. I also had my senior pics earlier this week and that went well enough. We did a whole bunch of scenes/outfit changes that ranged from shorts and a hoodie while standing in the middle of a waterfall, to shirtless with a cowboy hat, while holding a guitar over my back. Haha anyway it was cool, and I should get my proof's back in a day or two, so I'll probably end up posting a couple of them. I've been workin a lot lately, which is always kind of bittersweet, because work can be fun sometimes, and other times suck royally, but the paycheck is always a good thing, and the more I work the bigger it is. Oh, BTW, the word of the day is hooberschnaups, just because it sounds really cool. I don't have any idea what it means, but it kinda sounds german or something, which is a crazy language. Thats it for me then, I'll post again some time soon when I get a bit of time and I am feeling motivated...

      Running, running in the night, past the houses, past the light, gliding swiftly through the dark, my footprints scarcely leave a mark, finally I can just be me,   runnning in the night I'm free.

      Holla front kids.  Well I'm sittin at home, eatin raw onions, just because they taste that good, and make your nose feel funny.  Thats probably the highlight of my day :P because other exciting activities of the day included feeding my dentist friend's cat, helping a fellow employee get caught on work the video store, and plinking at pepsi can with a .22.  Oh, but I did watch Hildalgo today, and that was a pretty darn good movie.  Not like the Matrix or anything, but I like horses and cowboys n' stuff and Vergo Mortesomething isn't too bad of an actor.  Now I think I'm gonna go watch Vanilla Sky though, cuz I've never watched it before and I here its kinda messed up good.  So that's all - till next time, live crazy, drive fast and enjoy your last days of freedom before school starts!
