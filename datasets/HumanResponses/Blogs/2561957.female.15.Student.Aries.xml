       Okay. One might get the impression that Paul and I are "on again/off again." Well, sort of. It's more like, we're official, and then we're unofficial. It's all... erp...    &nbsp;  Anyways, I'm finally back home. I shouldn't be mad at Paul, because we're not even together anymore. But I am. Well, it's not really anger, just massive disappointment. Maybe that's worse than anger. I don't know.    &nbsp;  I stayed up last night until 3:30 AM talking to him on the phone. That's not as bad as it sounds, since I said I'd call him at around 1 AM.    &nbsp;  I love him. I can't help myself. On my old blog, I recorded 20-something reasons why I love him. Maybe I'll do that again on this one some day. Maybe I won't. It might actually make him feel worse if I did that. Perhaps it's best that I deleted my old blog, because if he'd reread any of my old reasons, he might have felt even worse about this week than he already does - which, if you knew him, is pretty hard to imagine.

       Paul made out with and groped Emma. Then he told me about it. Oddly enough, I've forgiven him... I mean, we're not even together, yeah. But... we are, ya know? It's all... jumble-jumble... o.o!   Anyways... out of a week, that's all I have to say. Fun, huh?   Oh! I went to Build-A-Bear Workshop. I was the oldest person there making one. I felt so insecure, but I did it anyways. It's so cute! I made a monkey, which I named Oreo. ^_^! I told my mom about it, and because I'm as bad as she is, she immediately said that tomorrow (Friday) we'll have to go back there and get him another outfit... I then told her that they had furniture for them, too. I'm so spoiled...I love it? =)

       Okay. So, it was Sara on the phone. Yadda yadda. It's okay, right?     &nbsp;   The day after we called it quits, he started telling me that he loved me again. I mean, like, regularly. What the fuck? I mean, holy shit, Kiddo. It's over. That means "Drop It." It's horrible, just utterly horrible. Especially because the day after he started that again, I responded equally with it as well...     &nbsp;   Oh. Sara likes him even more now. Something about carrying her. It's horrible, just all so horrible. And it pisses me off so much.     &nbsp;   I'm far too jealous...     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I wish it had been me instead of Sara.     &nbsp;   But it wasn't, and it never will be.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Not ever.

       Oh, God... Paul's going to the concert with some friends tomorrow: Sara, PJ, and Mel. He likes Sara. Sara likes him. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God...

       What do I do? It's been one day - less than, actually - and I'm not sure if I'm dead inside, but I can't stand it. I heard "Will You" on the radio earlier and just about spazzed out and caved. I can't be with you; I can't be without you. It just... sucks? Oh. Maybe you'll remember these; they both made me so happy I almost cried, but now I just can't look at them. It hurts too much.  &nbsp;  I'm feeling empty. Not dead, just like I sold my soul. I don't think I can stand it, but I still partially think that what I did was best. I mean, now you don't have to lie about being happy to me anymore. Even when you were glowing you still couldn't let go - even for just that one minute.  &nbsp;  So maybe this e-mail was pointless. Actually, I'm willing to bet my left lung that it was, like so many other things I do seem to be. Whatever. I'm going to post it on my blog, anyway. That way, I can remind myself how utterly sad I am, and, maybe, my blog will show up one day in the "Recently Updated" list and you can read it.  &nbsp;  I know you're not going to ask for anything of me. You never have unless I asked you to ask something of me so I wouldn't feel so useless. You're just going to wait until I think it's time to do God-knows-what before you decide to openly worry.  &nbsp;  Oh, lookie. I'm gabbering. I think that that's my cue to end this e-mail.  &nbsp;  -Frankie  &nbsp;  P.S.: Last night, before I went to bed, did you tell me you loved me? (I'm not sure, but I think you did. I was just depressed and tired last night...)

       I miss him so much, and I just wish I could tell him I'm sorry for hurting him. I never a knew a voice could sound so dead and detatched.  &nbsp;  Do I love him, or is this just teenage heartache?  &nbsp;  Oh, God... I wish I knew.

       I don't know what to feel right now... I mean, I feel sort of sad, still, but I'm not sure if this large stone in my heart is because it was real and I let it go, or because I just don't know how to handle this. It was just one of those nights last night, you know? He was perfectly willing to keep trying, but I just felt that I couldn't do it anymore... Now I wonder if I'd just held my tongue if things would still be alright.  &nbsp;  The phone sits there like the Devil taunting Eve with the Fruit. He's out somewhere with friends, I'm so sure of that. I can call him to see how he's doing right now, but that'd be fairly pointless... I should just grow up and accept what I did, but it's uber-hard.  &nbsp;  He's going to a concert tomorrow that he's been wanting to go to since... something. I just hope that I didn't ruin it for him...  &nbsp;  If I call, I'll be smothering. Technically, I shouldn't care anymore. It's over and done with, and I shouldn't even worry.  &nbsp;  Fuck it... Just fuck it...

       Okay... So Paul and I are officially "over." I hope that that lasts, I really do. I mean, nothing would ever work with us. Nothing. I wonder if I'll still feel this way tomorrow. Probably. Probably not. Oh, well. All we can really do is hope, right?    &nbsp;  Hope, oh, that was something I used to always try and cram into his widdle mind... Crap. I'm missing him. I'm missing him way too much, and it's been about an hour. I can't stop being bitter... Whenever I'm depressed, I always go into different stages. Let's go through the stages?   Stages of Depression:   (1) Spite   (2) Sadness   (3) Verbal Brutality   It just kind of repeats until I get over it. Isn't that awful?    &nbsp;  Anyways, I'm just going to go... I'll try and work on the blog thing later today. Maybe. Oh, I don't know...

       Alright, so I was thinking about trying again on this Blogspot. My other blog, which you can visit   urlLink  here   , is nice and very clean, but I didn't do anything but click the template of which I wanted. So... wish me luck?

       I miss cute little comments... Actually, I've never really had them. Perhaps this is because, for the most part, I never give out my blog address to everyone I know of. That's okay. I hate explaining myself. For those of you in this world who actually give a fuck on what I have to say, this is about as good as you're gunna get. This is generally the only place I'll ever explain myself, unless you have quite a bit of standing with me.      It's Paul's friend Alex's birthday today. They got him Doom 3. Yes. Violence, testosterone, and video game. Does a 19-year-old guy need anything more in life? How about - no?      Oh! There's this guy in my 2nd period. I don't think he knows anyone in that class, because he sits by himself and just sleeps. Anyways, yesterday he didn't wake up at the bell when it rang and everyone was just going to leave him there. I felt bad for him, so I woke him up? Okay. So I find him uber-cute. That means nothing, right? Right.      Anywho, I don't know what to think about Paul anymore - right now. It's like... yes, but just kinda in the grey zone. It'd be so much easier if our relationship were black/white... Oh, well.       Even though I know, I don't want to know. Yeah, I guess I know. I just hate how it sounds.

       Paul said he'd call me at 9-10. It's a bit over 10:30. He hasn't called yet. I'm sure he forgot. He's hanging out with PJ and Emma, so whatever.      The first day was alright. Massive pit in the middle of the hallways. It was like a fucking mosh pit. I mean, I almost fell three times. It was kinda fun, though, pushing my way through about 300 people in a space of about 10 feet.      Anywho, that's my blog entry for the day. Signing off.      Until next time.

       School starts in 4 and a half hours, and I can't sleep. Insomnia blows. I have to be up by 6:15, and I can't sleep. It's not cool. I should try sleeping again.      Oh. Paul can't stand me now. And apparently I don't say anything to people about what I think. Blogging is about the only way people know shit from me. They learn bits and pieces, but I'm afraid of letting people know me too well. I want them to know me that well, I just can't let go of myself. I did that once. Unconditionally, even. Unfortunately, it fucked up. Now I don't trust Paul like I should. Sometimes I don't trust him at all. Also, I rarely trust myself.      I give up.       I know everything sucks, yeah. And this is gunna be the last time you'll hear me complain.
