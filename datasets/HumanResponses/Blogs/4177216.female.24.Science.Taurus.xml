      Sometimes I wonder how I manage to get myself into the things I do. Take work for example. At what point did I go from this almost worthless student in cancer to this important, critical aspect of antibacterials? A few weeks ago I asked Jia for a raise. He thought I should have one and began to process all the paperwork. Well, at some point HR told him that there was this freeze with salaries. I guess recently Jia has continued pushing. He asked Steve H (head of molecular sciences) for me to have a 50% increase in my wage. Well, he wouldn't buy that but did approve bumping me up to $11.50/hour. This is just fine with me. But, Jia told me he went and to talked to Steve G and Steve G said he would support such an increase. I think that is crazy because I'm not even in his department. I don't think it will happen but it is at least nice to know that Steve G thinks so highly of me. So that is work.  Now, this leads me to do some more personal pondering so to speak. My career is looking pretty good. I have pleased enough people at Pfizer that it is really going to help me out in the long run. Love...I'm getting married next June and that's good. So, if career is good and love is good I'm left with one burning question: Why don't I feel happy?

      My long weekend is over. Its funny I don't feel rested at all. Saturday was a good sleeping day. But Sunday was church and then today we met with the guy Jon and I are looking at being our photographer. A busy weekend. But it will be nice to start the week on Tuesday. I guess the one bad thing is going to be trying to make up the hours.  I'm worried about my parents. My mom told me that her and my dad aren't getting along very well. I don't know what it is, but my dad has been really grouchy lately. He has just been so angry all the time. My mom said he has been mad at her for things she can't help. I don't know what is making him like this. I don't know if it's my Grandma A bothering him all the time or if it's his job or me getting married or what. I just don't want him to be mean to my mom. Its to the point that I don't really want to be home. But at the same time I don't want to leave my mom in that situation. I just wish that there was something, anything I could do to make things better. Sometimes I just want to yell at my dad and tell him to stop being mean to my mom. They've been married for 30 years, this isn't a time for their marriage to fall apart. I've felt like if my parents can survive then so can I. What would happen to that if they didn't? I guess that is pretty selfish of me but right now I think that I need to be a little selfish. Its hard to talk to Jon about it. His family is so perfect. Its not like they having any problems. The only thing wrong is Jennifer with her severe middle child syndrome. Sometimes I wonder if his parents ever fight. Its nothing against Jon but it does make me feel a little like he doesn't quite understand. When we were at the photographer, he asked us about our parents for pictures and we told him both sets were married. He just about fell out of his chair with shock. I must say that I think that is very sad. What is our society coming to? Do that many people marry on a whim? Am I getting married on a whim? Maybe it's just me getting nervous about what is happening with my parents. I don't know. I think it is very clear that I am the "evil" one in the relationship. I'm the one that is trouble. I feel like Jon thinks that. Sometimes I feel like he can do no wrong and that all that would go wrong with our relationship would come from me. I just don't know what to do.

      I took the GRE. We'll see if I need to take it again. It would be for the verbal portion. I got a 440 in the verbal, a 660 in the quantitative and an 800 in the analytical. I could not believe I got a perfect score on the analytical portion. I seriously thought it was the wrong score. I'm going to wait and see what percentile I end up in but chances are with that verbal score so low I will take it again. Give myself some time to learn some new vocabulary. I just don't want to lose that perfect score on the analytical portion. Because chances are pretty good that I won't do that well again. I mean come on, how many times can you get a perfect score on the GRE? I'm going to talk to some people and find out what their thoughts are. Because maybe my low verbal score won't make a difference. We'll just have to see.

      I take the GRE tomorrow. I'm nervous. I'm so worried that I am going to do poorly. There is part of me that wants to go on to grad school but then there is this other part of me that doesn't want to. The part that says just take the job at Pfizer and stay in Ann Arbor. This is the same part of me that wants to be on Survivor and be a photographer on the side. I know that I will go and take the GRE and hopefully do well enough to get into graduate school. Then, I'll just go on and get my PhD and everything will be just how it is supposed to be. There is a part of me that wonders if that will make me happy. I'm sure if I get the job that I want, doing the things that I want I'll be fine. I'm sure everyone goes through this so I guess I just need to make sure I pray about it.

      I just know it. Even though he won't tell me, I know there is something. It really bugs me sometimes when he does this. I swear he can be the girl in the relationship and I don't like that. I know that we were both a little grouchy Saturday on the way back from Cedar Point but that was because we were both really tired and I am so very sunburnt. He slept on the floor that night, I don't know what was going with that. Then, last night he slept with his back to me the whole night. When I asked him about it tonight he said it was the only way he could sleep so that his neck didn't hurt. I don't know about that. I just wish he would tell me when something is bothering him. He can be such a girl sometimes.

      I'm getting married! Sometimes I just glance down at my ring and get so excited. I am getting married and every once in a while it really hits me and that is when I get super excited. It makes me feel like I'm eight and it is Christmas morning. Giddy might be a good word to describe it.  Yesterday/Wednesday (16th and 17th) marked three years since Jon and I decided that we were lying to ourselves by saying we are just friends. I remember that night so well. It was the night after our spring fling and week after prom. That was all so...so...magical. I know that sounds super cheesy but it was. It was seriously storybook. It is really hard to believe that it was three years ago. It really doesn't seem that long. Time really does fly. In just over a year Jon and I are getting married. Before I know it forever will have come and gone. Wow, forever...that is a long time. That's a long time to be in love with someone. But you know what? I'm really excited about it.

      I did not get to talk to Jon tonight and I was a little disappointed. I don't like not being able to talk to him but I guess that really isn't that bad of a thing. It's only Monday and already I am wishing it was Friday. I'm not sure what we are going to do with weekend. I want to go to Cedar Point but I don't want to just say it. That costs money and we all know how Jon hates to spend money. I probably just won't say anything and we won't go. That is something I tend to do quiet often. I want to go so bad though. Cedar Point is so much fun. It would be great to go now because won't be busy at all. What is wrong with me though? Why can't I just say, Jon how about we go to Cedar Point on Saturday? AHHH!!! I frustrate myself. I'm such a non-confrontational person it makes me sick sometimes. Why do I do this to myself? I let people walk all over me and then I feel bad. I do all of this to myself. Maybe a day will come when I'm able to say what I am really thinking. You'd think I would be able to considering we have been together for 3 years. Maybe I will soon since 3 years will be turning into forever. Forever is a long time to walk around thinking and not speaking. This is something that I need to work on.

      I have discovered that some of the times when I am the happiest is when I'm with my two little cousins, Jacob and Ellie. The simplicity of their lives just puts me at ease. They have the simplest joys. Jacob, who is 2 and a half, got so happy when I blew up a balloon for him. He was so happy to see me. He is so cute. When I was at Aunt Carole's he had on this bicycle helmet because he wanted to go for a bike ride. The helmet was too big for his head and I told him he looked cute. He walked over to me and wanted a kiss on his cheek so I gave him a kiss. Then he said, "What? No big hug?" So I hugged him and we all laughed. Ellie, who is 4 months, is even simpler. All you have to do is talk sweetly to her and she will smile and laugh. Nothing is sweeter than when a baby laughs. For them life is so very simple. It really makes me feel better and less stressed when I get to be around them.

      At last, my long lost fiance returns. Seeing Jon again for the first time is always the best feeling. It's like I fall in love with him all over again. Yesterday I mentioned winning a wedding dress. I figure what better way to tell this story then on the day my Jon comes back for the summer.  It was April 28 of this year, I came home after just taking the incredibly grueling GRE subject exam. My mom had told me that a new bridal shop had opened up in my hometown (why anyone decided on there is beyond me...but hey, I'm not complaining.) Their grand opening was the weekend I was home. My mom had also told me that at 3:30 pm that day they were having a drawing for a free wedding dress. So, mom, grandma, Aunt Carole and I all go up there (everything is a family affair.) So I fill out a card and stick it in the box for the drawing and then I go about my business picking out gowns to try on. I got a big stack of gowns and my mom and I go back to the dressing rooms and I start trying them on. All of a sudden people are calling out my name. So I come out and my aunt says to me that I won the dress. I didn't believe her at first but then all these people were running back towards me. A few people we saying, "You won, you won." I was shocked. I wish there were some words I could use to describe what I was feeling but I just can't do it justice. It was a feeling of overwhelming joy and relief. Overwhelming is a pretty good word to describe it. It had come at the right time. We were so worried about the cost of things and this felt like a heavy burden lifted off our shoulders. It was truly a blessing. It was great, I could choose any dress in the store but it had to be off the rack. I wasn't going to get one that day because I was just in so much shock. But when we were going back to the dressing room my mom saw a dress hanging up in the back and she said, "Why don't you try this one on, it looks really pretty." I said okay and we went back and put it on. It was perfect! It even fit perfect! I knew right then that  was  my dress. It was like it was custom tailored just for me! It is beautiful!!! It was really cute because my grandma left and told my grandpa and he came running up there with the camera to take my picture. I had already taken the dress off but it put it back on for him. It may be the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me. It is going to be so hard not telling Jon about it. How do you keep a secret like this from the person you tell everything to? AHHH!!!!!

      I am so convinced that I am lactose intolerant. Everytime I eat dairy my stomach hurts. I really haven't felt well all day since I ate my daily bagel with cream cheese. I'm very tired and my chest has felt tight all week. Monday I tried to do Tae-Bo and after 15 minutes I couldn't breathe at all. I guess I just feel like crap all over.  On a positive note, Jon will be home tomorrow. I haven't seen him in a month. How much does it suck that I only get to see my fiance once a month? But he will be home for the summer and that means I will see him every weekend. I wish it was everyday.  I just finished watching the last bit of Survivor. Its weird because I watched a bit of the first one and I thought it was stupid. I liked this one and I really got into it. Maybe it was just because Colby was so gorgeous but I liked it. When I first thought about it I thought I would never do that but now I think I would. Survivor 3 has already been cast but maybe 4? Who knows? It would truly be a great adventure. It would be the ultimate test of me as a person. This fall when Survivor 3 airs, who knows maybe next fall when they get set on 4 I will try. I probably wouldn't get put on but hey, I never thought I would win a wedding dress either.

      I go into work at 6 am and at 10:30 am the power went out. So, they sent us to turn off all the not important stuff. We didn't have power for two and a half hours and they still didn't send us home! Finally at 1 pm my boss, Jia, told me to write 8 hours on my time card and just go home. Everybody lost their experiments. It was bad.  Well, Jon didn't call me on my birthday and he was really being mean about it. I did finally get him to apologize. It is a start but how do I know that he isn't going to do it again? He really seems to do things like this when it really matters. Sometimes I feel like I am asking too much to have to show that he cares. I know he does but that doesn't mean he doesn't have to do things to show it. It's weird sometimes because there are times when Jon is so perfect and knows exactly what to say and when to say it. But then there are other times when he does the stupidest stuff and says all the wrong things. Its like I'm dealing with two different people. He'll be home from Tech soon and things will be better. Just 3 more days.

      I figure what better time to start keeping a journal then on the first day of my "adult" life. I refuse to call this a diary. A diary is something a 12-year old girl keeps. I'm not a "kid" anymore, although it is more common for me to be thought of as 12 rather than 21. But, ah, so is life.  Today was a good day (it should be, it  is  my birthday after all) even though I didn't get a paycheck. See, I used to work for Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis but about a year ago Pfizer took it over. What they call a hostile take over. Anyway, after we became Pfizer, I switched departments from cancer to infectious diseases. Well, it took a year for everything to finish being Pfizerized. Our department split into Antibacterial Pharmacology and Antibacterial Molecular Sciences. I went with the Molecular Sciences but no one told me so there was confusion and I go no paycheck, buy things got straightened out and I'll get paid on Tuesday. But that has  NOTHING    to do with my birthday.  Let's start with when I woke up: my roommate Lisa started out my birthday with a totally decorated kitchen. They (my friend Ryan included) also decorated my car. I am so unhappy with Ryan's girlfriend Aarthie. They were supposed to come out with us but at the last minute, Aarfie (as I call her) decided that she wanted to have a "romantic" evening with Ryan. It made me so mad that she had to pick my 21st birthday for that! I think she didn't want Ryan to be with me. I don't understand why she would be threatened by me. I'm getting married for crying out loud!!! I love Jon and would never try to steal Ryan away from her. Ryan did stop by though, he brought her with him but at least I got to see him. Lisa and Ryan got me a giant Super Soaker. It's pretty cool. Amy (my best friend from high school) came down. It was so good to be with her again. So, Lisa, Amanda, Amy and I went to dinner at TGI Fridays (I  LOVE  Fridays). I now have a new favorite drink: Strawberry daiquiris.

      It really kind of bothers me that Jon isn't coming down tonight.  It really isn't so much that he's not coming down but more because of the reason he game.  He said we wasn't coming down because he wanted to paint his car.  Now, how lame is that?  It couldn't wait until next weekend or Wednesday when he had the whole day off, he had to do it today and tomorrow!  It really bothers me that he did that.  Seriously, what is wrong with him.  It really bothers me.  It's not like it was a family member's birthday or he had to work or anything like that, it was because he had to paint his car.  No, not even because he had to but because he  wanted  to.  It's almost like him saying I would rather wash my car than come see you and that is a little hurtful from my point of view.  But the thing is: I don't think he ever stops to see things from my point of view.  But then again, why would he?  He is just a boy after all!  Then, he called me and told me he doesn't want to talk tonight because he's not done painting his car.  So now, not only do I not get to see him, I don't get to talk to him either and it really makes me want to scream.

      I went back to the doctor today because I'm still not doing so well. He said that I still have the bronchitis and he could still hear wheezing in my lungs. He also tested me for mono since we think that is what Ronnie has. I don't think it is good. I hope its not mono. That would really suck. If it isn't mono then I could see myself getting it later if Ronnie has it. I would just hate to give it to Jon. Speaking of Jon, he came down to stay with me tonight. He just drove down from class. I'm worried about not sleeping well tonight. It has been awhile since I've slept well. I hope the cough medicine the doctor gave me helps me to breathe a little bit.

      It was back to work after being out for so long sick. It really tired me out. I know that I am still not 100%. I think it is entirely possible that I have a mild case of pneumonia. I'm really struggling with my breathing. I can feel it in the lower part of my lungs. My brother might have mono. He has something and I don't want to have picked it up. I can't afford to be sick any longer. I'm coughing again, I don't know what that means. I've been using this inhaler for a week and my breathing still isn't better. Today, I feel worse than before. Maybe it is just work and me being tired but I don't feel well. I've had no appetite. I'm supposed to be getting better. Being back to work also means I didn't get to see Jon. I almost cried this morning when he turned on Huron St. Maybe it was because I didn't feel well but I did. Friday seems so far away.

      I am so happy because Jon and I had a good weekend. We didn't fight at all. We definitely needed a weekend like this. We weren't extremely active because I'm still having breathing problems. I think that we had just the right amount of activity. So let's see what did we do.   Friday:  We went to Meijer's and got groceries because I was really in need of some food. We had potatoes and burgers for dinner. While Jon grilled the burgers I made the yummy potatoes. It was so nice to make dinner together. I think it may have been the best dinner. We rented a couple movies that we watched. We say  Pay It Forward  and  Fargo  because Jon had never seen it before.   Saturday:  We walked up to campus and had lunch at Einstein's. Then we walked around campus. I took some pictures so that I would have them for my scrapbook. We came back to my house and took a short nap because I was so tired front he walk. Jon made me a nacho dinner. We watched  You've Got Mail  and  The Wedding Singer . I love  You've Got Mail . I think it is such a great movie. I think part of it might be related to how Jon and I got together. We spent so much of our relationship by e-mailing and talking of AOL IM. Anyway, it's a great movie.  Today we went and played a little bit of Frisbee. We didn't play for too long though. It was pretty warm and I was having a difficult time breathing. After we finished we relaxed at my house for awhile. My lungs are really inhibited right now. Much physical activity makes me struggle. Jon has been really good though. I'm really hoping that it is going to subside a bit. We had hamburgers and potatoes again. Jon made them for me. He really spoils me. I really want to be careful not to take advantage of that. I feel bad sometimes when he is always insisting on doing stuff for me. I am sure it will al stop someday. I mean doesn't it have to stop?  I feel that I had a bit of breakthrough Saturday though. I was able to have some physical activity with Jon and not get totatly grossed out. That was really a big step for me. I'm not sure if everytime I'm going to be able to do that but this was a big step for me. I just have to focus on what would be going on and not on things of the past. What was strange though is that I am perfectly happy not doing anything sexual. Don't get me wrong it still isn't a bad thing but I'm impartial. I have no problem with us not being physical. But that might just be related to the fact that I am a girl and girls tend not to think that like. But anyway, I was just happy we had a good weekend. No wait, we had a great weekend.

      It has been really nice to be at home. There is just an incredible level of comfort that comes from being at home. Ronnie and the dogs can be very irritating but even that has its level of comfort. There is just something about being at home. It could be because I associate home with safety and relaxation. It has been so long since I've spent any length of time there.  Boy, I could really get used to this seeing Jon everyday deal. Well, I guess I have to since I am marrying him in like 360 days. Oh wow! It is so exciting to think that in less than a year we are going to be married. AHH!!! So exciting. It will be so nice to be done with work and just relax with him. He has been coming over after work and class. I'm not sure how this weekend is going to work. We have to spend the weekend at my apartment. I really need to be alone with him. We need this weekend to be alone and to be together. Just us. I really think that we are going to be okay. Lately, I just have really been feeling a lot better about us and that sort of thing. I'm not sure if it was the wedding that did it or what. I'm just so glad it happened  My mom brought me home a yellow calla lily plant. I love calla lilies. They are my ultimate favorite flower, so of course I am going to have them in my wedding. I will have yellow calla lilies in my bouquet and it will be so beautiful because my mom will have made it for me so it will also be very special. I'm so excited to be getting married. I can hardly wait. I watch the Wedding Story on TLC and I get so excited when the couple says their vows because I think that so soon it will be me and Jon and that will be so wonderful. I am  SO    in love with him.

      I am getting so tired of not being able to breathe. I went back to the doctor's today. He is saying its inflammation from the bronchitis I had/have. This is insane, I'm doing everything I can think of to help me breathe but to no avail. At the doctor I did this breathing treatment thing. All that did was make me very shaky and really feel like I was going to pass out. He put me on this inhaler that I'm hoping after a few times will help me breathe. I can't go back to work for a few days so that sucks. All I want is to be able to breathe and that in turn should help me sleep at night. This is getting so frustrating.  The only good thing I see about me getting sick is that I have gotten to see Jon. He stopped by tonight. I really feel like I'm to the point that we may be able to try something physical. However, I think that I may need to be the one that is in control. He cannot dictate what happens because that is what happened last time and it freaked me out. We have 362 days until our wedding, I need to be past this by then. I'll have to get myself all psyched up during the time we are together and then just follow through. We aren't fighting as much. This weekend was a good weekend once we got past the troubles of him not calling me. I just really wish that I had been able to spend more time alone with him. That is the problem with being at home for the weekend. Next weekend I will be at my apartment and we will get to be alone again. I think that Jon and I really need this weekend alone and together to go smoothly. Things have been so rough lately that it would be a much needed advancement for us. I love Jon dearly and I just want to take this on to the next level.

      My pastor from when I was young was back at our church today. Pastor Bob was such a wonderful pastor. Ever since he left, our church has really fallen apart. We have been plagued with bad pastors. It was so great to have everyone back at our church. Jon came with me and got to meet my childhood pastor. I wish that Pastor Bob could perform his ceremony but he and his wife are missionaries in Micronesia. He isn't sure he will be back in time. Jon and I also have Pastor Fowler doing the ceremony but he is no Pastor Bob. We shared the same birthday and when I was little I always used to take a cupcake over to him. I was so glad that Jon was able to meet him. The last few days have really helped me with the Jon situation. I'm so ready to marry him. It is exciting to think that we are getting married and going to be together forever. I am so in love with him and it is so clear how much God has blessed me. I am so blessed in every aspect of my life.

      This was a busy, long day. Today was Marcella and Josh's wedding. I went to high school with Marcella but she graduated two years before me. I lived with her and her twin sister, Tonya, two summers ago. That was also when I got to know Josh. Josh is a defensive tackle for a pro football team. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met. So is Marcella and it just makes me so happy that they are together because I know they will be so happy together. Their wedding was so nice and so beautiful. My mom did the flowers and, as always, they were breath-taking. The Cornells always like unusual flowers so this wedding was no exception. They had all these flowers from Hawaii. My poor mother was freaking out. But of course it was all so beautiful. I really liked Marcella's bouquet. It was purple and white with these white lilies in it. The wedding was outside at the Cornell's house. It was really nice. One thing they did with the programs that I really liked was they put in a paragraph about why they chose who they did to be attendants. I just thought that was really nice.  They had a little reception at the house right after the ceremony. Then they had another reception at the Radisson with a meal and dancing. Jon and I paid particular attention at the Radisson since that is where we are having our reception. I thought the food was very good. They served a fruit plate before the wedding party got there. I liked that a lot. As far as the dinner I liked the vegetables, the red skin potatoes and the chicken they served. I did like the room set up. However, there needed to be one more set of salt and pepper shakers on the tables. The band was different. It was reggae. It was cool at first but how do you dance to reggae? White people  can't  dance to reggae.

      Today marks one year until Jon and I get married. That's for one year for Jon to get his act together. He finally decided to call him. At 7:00!! He claimed that he didn't know I was sick. I sent him an e-mail saying I was. Boy, he is just full of excuses. He was getting mad at me because I wasn't talking to him! I clearly told him what was up. I don't know what is wrong with him. All I want is a small amount of appreciation. I would like him to care that I have bronchitis and am sick. He doesn't seem to act like it. I feel I have no lung capacity right now. Whenever I'm around Jon he likes to play off whatever may be bothering me. I'm not sure what his deal is. It needs to change because in one year we are supposed to get married.

      I've been home for two nights because I'm sick and I haven't heard from Jon at all. What is wrong with him? I do not understand at all. I mean does he really not care at all. It is so upsetting to me. I just feel like screaming. I know he has had class but I haven't heard from him at all and it really pisses me off. Almost to the point that I'm not even sure I want to see him tomorrow. He can go have his skanky Niki for all I care. With her he could have had all the sex he wanted and years ago. And he wonders why I think he doesn't care about me. It's totally obvious Jon!!

      Since Jon has been avoiding the Niki issue I haven't even wanted to talk to him. It is bad because I don't want to e-mail him either. This is why things should not go unsaid. I try to talk about issues such as this but he is constantly changing the subject on me, it is so irritating. I could have talked to him tonight but I would rather go to bed and get some extra sleep. Although, it really seems like we have been fighting a lot lately. I'm not really sure why but I'm really getting tired of it. I just want Jon to listen and not try to change the subject whenever I need to talk. A lot of times it feels like Jon is a lot more focused on himself then on our relationship. He's always been like that. Sometimes I think it might be in part because he is a little bit jealous of me. He completely ruined my aunt giving me their car. I was so scared to tell him about my job offer because I was afraid he would do something and make it bad. I should have to be worried about that. Should he be happy about my good news? I was very glad when this time he was. Maybe that is another something that makes us fight. It really is getting frustrating for me though. I wonder if he is frustrated too.  I feel like I am killing myself. I'm getting sick. It might be because I work 10 hour days or it might be because I'm stressing over Jon. Whatever it is, I don't think it is healthy. I mean its summer! How can I get sick in the middle of the summer? It is absurd I tell you. I need rest.

      This is probably my fault. Well, most of the time it is my fault. Our senior year of high school, at the beginning of the year and the summer before, Jon had this fling with a freshman, Niki. Well, I cannot stand this girl. She is trash. She is such a little skanky-ass whore and I hate that Jon is still friends with her. She ended things with him not long after school started because he wasn't "cool enough." I do not like her and she does not like me. Well, today was her open house. Since her family and Jon's family are friends they were invited. So, Jon calls me up and tells me he wants to go. I hate this girl! He actually has the nerve to ask me if I want to go. Of course I say no, but he is still going. I don't understand how this one person that I don't like is the one person he still insists on seeing. It's not that I don't trust Jon, I don't trust her! She is a little slut! There is just something that prevents us from talking when I am upset. All I wanted to do was talk to him alone. This is not possible in my house. I just wanted to be alone to talk. We were going to go see a movie but Jon kept pushing back the time. I got fed up and said I'm going back to my apartment. I thought maybe he would come with me. At first he did say he would and then he said he'd see and then he wasn't. It was like he just said it because he felt like it would make me feel better or something. Its not like I would have expected him to come. He never does. I know him much better than that. Any slight amount of resistance that may come from his family makes him not do what he wants. This time it was his sister that decided our fate. How lovely is that? So once again I am forced to talk to him about something bothering me on the damn computer. Then we did talk we didn't even talk about what was bothering me! But, really am I surprised? I always have to go to bed with things still on my mind. So now I'm not going to talk to him until I see him on Friday. How great is that? How am I supposed to go five days without talking to him about this? Why does he always do this to me? I just feel like screaming.  AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!   It is going to kill me sitting on this all week. On top of it all, I'll be at home again this weekend so we probably won't even be able to talk then. Why is it that we have such a massive problem with communication? Maybe its because I have a relationship with a computer and not a person. That could be part of my problem. Why is it that this happens to me? This is frustrating me so much that I feel sick to my stomach. My stomach was really hurting earlier and this must be why. I'm not sure I will physically be able to handle this fighting. It might kill me. I really want this to stop and things to be back to normal. I'm so tired of fighting.

      So we had a gathering for my dad's side of the family today. This was the first time they had met Jon. My Uncle Ken and Denise made me nervous. Denise is just a bitch and I was so scared of what she might say to Jon or about Jon or to me. Fortunately they were all pissy about something and were only there for 45 minutes. My mom's side of the family is much warmer. They really like Jon. I'm so glad my fiance is so lovable. It really makes life easier.

      Today was a very exciting day. Today marks the day that all of my hard work and dedication at Pfizer has finally paid off. I was offered a full-time position today. We had a group meeting today and I was the only person who had any data to present. So, I put up my data and got attacked by Tod, this arrogant bastard from chemistry who finds fault with everyone. I let his comment just roll off my back. So, after the meeting I was walking out with Jia, Steve D, and Mike K and Steve D told me that the "flames were starting to burn on this project and Heather is our coal." Mike suggested that Pfizer should pay for school in the fall. I said that I liked that idea. It was then that we started talking about me and what my plans were for after graduation. Then Jia started to tell me about his meeting with Steve H on Monday. They met and discussed my raise. Jia's justification for my raise is that I am such a hard worker and my data is good. Well, Steve H told him that maybe they should just put me on staff. I couldn't do that now because of school full-time but the job is there when and if I want it. So, I'm really going to have to think it over and talk with Jon and talk with my family. But the option is there and that is nice to know.

      Jon and I talked yesterday about our problem. It went a lot better than our talk Monday night. Monday we were mean, last night we were civil. I definitely prefer civil. We talked about our problem. We decided that we think part of the problem is that we never seem to do anything on the weekend. This weekend for example: we just sat around all day. I think that when we aren't up and about doing stuff we are so bored that we just start to irritate each other. We are going to try doing more stuff together on the weekends. I hope that fixes the problem. IF it doesn't...I'm not sure what we are going to do. I've got some ideas for this weekend. Friday: Have a fire at my house and have marshmallows and s'mores. Saturday: During the day we have a gathering with my dad's side of the family. At night we can just relax and rent a movie or something. Sunday: After church I was thinking maybe a picnic if it is nice out.  Things at work are going pretty well. Jia is really pushing for getting me that raise. I was talking to Mike K today and he said that Jia thinks very highly of me. I really try to come across as a good worker. These people are really helping me out. It makes me feel good to know that I'm so important to the project I am working on. Steve D told me today that I was going to be carrying the group through the next set of compounds we are working on. I want to be well like because it helps me down the road. I do what I can to better myself.  I did something today I never thought I would do. I bought a purse. I'm not going to call it a purse though, I'm going to call it a bag. I just got really tired of never being able to find my checkbook when I need it.

      Talking to Jon has helped. I'm not sure he really understands though. There are two parts to me. There is the scientist that always is looking at the facts, the data. Then there is the dreamer. The dreamer is always wanting this unattainable things. This is the part that lives in the world in my head. It is the scientist in me that is always pulling me back to reality. Sometimes, I just want the scientist to go away and let me chase my fantasies. I told all this to Jon. I don't think he understood. But how can I tell him that he is part of that reality. Perhaps I will be happy when my dreams and reality mesh. The big question is...will this ever happen? If it doesn't, will I ever really be happy?

      Humility is the topic of today's devotional. It is, in a way, a very difficult topic. There are so many ways as to perceive humility. I try to be humble and I think that is something that I really want to strive to be. I do not think that I am above God by any means. In fact, I truly believe that He has blessed me in so very many ways. Every advancement I have made in my life has come with God's Hand behind me, guiding me. I can honestly day that I have achieved nothing without God's help. In fact, the times in my life where I have stumbled have been the times where I have fallen or stumbled in my walk with the Lord. It's like the quote I have at the end of my e-mails:  "If the Lord is with me, then who can be against me."  Oh, the Bible has so much great stuff. My favorite verse is Romans 3:23:  "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."  But that is why Jesus came so that we might be saved.  Amen to Jesus.

      I think it is so amazing that when you are thinking about a spiritual issue, God always shows support in the Bible. This evening I read a passage that goes perfectly with what I was talking about yesterday:    As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in the womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.   -Ecclesiastes 11:5 (NIV)     It just fits so perfectly with what I was saying yesterday about how the more I know about biology the more in awe I am of it all. Right there it is saying that we are never going to know everything. If anyone has doubts, it's right there in God's Word.  On a similar note, last week Jia had told me about a Bible Study that they had at Pfizer. So, I went today. I really enjoyed it. It was so nice and refreshing to know that there are other Christians in the company. I enjoyed it so much that I wish it would have lasted longer in fact. I am rather disappointed that I won't be able to go once classes start up again. That would be nice to go during the year, especially since life gets very busy. I have to make sure to take a little time out to focus on God.

      How do I recognize God's presence in nature? How do I sense God's hand moving in every situation of my life?  As a biologist I am able to study God's work in our own design. Everyday that I study and learn about the complexity of biological systems I am just in more and more in awe of God's awesome power. It always leads me to wonder why scientists and biologists can not believe in God. We are said to know so much but really we know so little. I feel that by studying biology, the study of life, I am, in fact, studying God's work, I am left in total wonder and amazement of what he has done. In my profession belief in God is rare and I was a little worried about how this would affect my faith. It has increased it. The more I learn, the more I know that God is the great and almighty.  I feel God's presence in every aspect of my life. He has blessed me over and over again that I am left we no other option but to go with Him when times are bad. I know that all I need to do is pray. I've learned that all things happen for a reason and especially with the bad it just sometimes takes a while to figure out what that is. Right now my family's focus is on His plan with Ellie. Yesterday she was having seizures. Julie and David took her to Mott's Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. They ran some tests and she is home now but we are all praying that she will be all right.  Jon and I had a very busy weekend. I'll just go through each day.  Friday:  I drove home and had lunch with my mom and Grandpa. After lunch I went over to Aunt Carole's and swam laps. Then, Jon and I saw  Jurassic Park 3  and ate dinner at Olive Garden.  Saturday:  In the morning, Jon and I had a meeting with a the Cake Salon. We got some cake samples which were pretty yummy and we also got some good ideas. After that, I went to Aunt Carole's to work on our scrapbooks. Jon and I were together again later. We ran into Meijer's and rented  O Brother Where Art Thou . I fell asleep.  Sunday:  We had another meeting with Cake Art. Jon and I liked this lady much better and she is cheaper. Afterwards, we swam at Aunt Carole's because it has just been so hot. Oh, oh, oh! I almost forgot. Jon finally saw our photographer and we now have a reason why we didn't hear from him. For one, he hurt his shoulder and was in rehab, he also was transferred to Detroit for work. But anyway, he felt so back about not getting back to us that he is giving us a 30% discount. So that is good. I am pretty sure we are going to go with him. He is so much cheaper than anyone else. That made us both pretty happy. All this wedding planning stuff is going pretty well. I am so fortunate that things are going so smoothly.

         Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.   -Romans 12:21 (NIV)        Next time I want to react selfishly to a situation, what can I do instead?  This is a difficult question to answer.  We humans have a selfish nature.  People always say that you have to look out for yourself.  It is scary to think about letting that go.  It's almost like giving up control and I know that I hate to do that.  But when I am next put in that situation I'll try to step back and think about how I could go about things differenlty.  I must say that I do not see myself as an overly selfish person.  I really tend to do things for others more than for myself.  I don't know why I do things that way but I just do.  Perhaps it was because I was raised that way or because I'm Christian.  It's not something I try to do, it's just the way I react.

       Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. -Luke 11:1 (NIV)   I've decided that while I am giving my body a work-out, I also need to give my soul a spiritual work out. So, I'm getting back to my devotionals. There is this one called Campus Journal so I thought I would use this to write about that.  If anyone considers himself righteous and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. -James 1:26 (NIV)   Considering the way I use my mouth, is my religion real of fake? Lately, I find that I am really trying to cut back on how much I talk about other people. It can really be trying sometimes when others are doing the same. It is difficult not to join in. That is something I need to work on. I do find that I don't tend to lead it. I do "tease" Jon but he does the same thing to me. I also find it hard not to "dish it back." I'm not one to just let someone rip into me but I suppose that just makes another thing for me to work on.

      I was irritated with Jon because he had promised me he would stop by the photographer's house on Saturday but he didn't. But did that surprise me? No, not really. I was so angry because he gets this attitude where he doesn't stop to think about things. Sometimes he can act like he just doesn't care. I was so glad that he was able to redeem himself by stopping by tonight. But of course the guy wasn't there. This is getting incredibly annoying. We want to book this guy but he is really making life difficult. We are really trying to give him our business but it doesn't appear to be wanting it. All I want is a photographer who is good and cheap. The cake situation is going pretty well. I think that we are going to be able to find a nice and reasonably priced wedding cake. I just really would like to get the big stuff taken care of this summer before Jon goes back to school. It will be really difficult once he is back to being 600 miles away. It sucks to think that about he leaving again but knowing that in 334 days we will be married makes it better. Part of me wants fall semester to start because the faster it starts, the faster it ends and the faster I get married.

      This was not overly restful weekend. Yesterday, Lisa and I spent the day at Cedar Point. That is fun but boy it really can make you tired. It was also a bummer because I didn't to see Jon. I tried to call Jon but he wasn't home. I wanted to see if either he could come down or I was going to go home. But he never called me back. I'm not sure why. Sometimes I think he just doesn't care. Sometimes that boy really makes me wonder what is going through his head.  But, about my trip to Cedar Point with Lisa. It was fun but I was unable to get her to go on the Millennium Force which is the best roller coaster. I went on the Mantis for her and it really messed up my head. Today my ankles are really sore. Lisa owes me about $20 from the whole trip. She also owes me a ride on the Millennium Force.

      After talking to Jon last night he told me that he didn't know why he was upset. I didn't do anything according to him. He said he just wanted to go and be alone but he regretted it afterwards. It sucked because by the time he realized how stupid he was it was too late. But of course that didn't do anything for me. Now he told me he would come down Thursday because Saturday I'm going with Lisa to Cedar Point. So we won't get to spend the whole weekend together. I'm not sure if he is going to come down later in the week or not. I don't know what was going on with Jon. I don't understand what was wrong with him. He was so grouchy and angry acting. He was really acting like he just wanted to get rid of me. But he says that I didn't do anything and what other choice do I have but to believe him? I would hope that he wouldn't lie about that. I'll see him tomorrow because I have a doctor's appointment Wednesday morning so that will be good.

      Another weekend has gone by. While the weekends at home are nice they really suck with the Jon factor. One good thing is that we do get to go to church together and I like that but as far as us being together it is pretty bad. To top it all off Jon was acting like there was something wrong. After church and washing my car, we swam at my aunt's. Jon just really seemed like he wanted nothing to do with me. It was like he just wanted to get rid of me or something. I don't know what his deal is. I don't know what I did. He was kind of like this all weekend. I'm not even sure he's going to talk to me at all. It seems to me like he would be wanting to see me since I'm going with Lisa to Cedar Point on Saturday and not going to see him but you never can tell with a boy. I really feel like he is upset with me about something. I'm not real sure how I feel about the way this weekend went. I know I don't feel the best about it. But what can I do? The only option I have is to sit and wait and hope he signs on so that I can talk to him. I just wish I knew what I did. Its not like him just to drop me off at 4:00 pm and say that's it for the week.

      I was so proud of myself. I changed my own oil today. I think I really surprised Jon by doing it. I somehow manage to surprise him quite often by doing things like that. You'd think by now he'd have figured out that I do non-girly things. We have been really busy this weekend by working on all my car stuff and things like that. Any weekend when I come home to Jon and I really don't get that much time to be together and I don't like it.

      I am so glad that it is finally the weekend. I am spending this weekend at home and it is really going to involve a lot of getting things accomplished. Jon and I are going to take care of the rust spots on my car and wash and wax her. My car wasn't really badly rusted but I thought it would be best to take care of them before they get too bad. We are also going to focus on doing a lot of wedding stuff. It will be a busy weekend. That's kind of how at home weekends are. Today was really about sanding and putting primer on the rust spots. That was what we did today. Earlier, I got to spend some time with Jacob and Ellie. I love to be around them. It is so refreshing for me. The simplicity of their little worlds is so great. I swam with Jacob this afternoon and he really wanted me to hold him a lot. It was so nice because he can just be so sweet and he is so smart and so cute. And Ellie, there is just something about babies. They are so amazing really. They are so amazing really. The way they feel when they snuggle against you to sleep. The way they are just so happy and pleased with the world. They really are wonderful. Jacob and Ellie really let me know that I want to be a parent.

      I did the most disgusting thing today. I cleaned out our refrigerator. Oh my goodness there was some really gross food in there. Some of the stuff was mold and gross that I just had to throw away the tupperware too. I like Lisa, she is one of my closest friends but she is really bad at cleaning. I think that 90% of the stuff I had to throw out was hers. Oh my it was so very disgusting. I suggested from here on out using the disposable Gladware. I just want to save myself from having to do this again.  Okay, I am such a nerd. I decided that every week I would read two journal articles. One from the  Journal of Bacteriology  and one from the  Journal of Virology . I'm doing this to get myself ready for my virology series at the medical school this fall. But it is kind of cool that I can how read these articles and understand probably 85-90% of what they are saying. I am starting to feel like I might actually be approaching a professional scientific level. How cool is that? I know I am a big nerd but what can I say, I really like what I do. Isn't that a good thing? I think that we are all put here on this earth for a purpose. I think that my purpose is to do virology research. That is my calling. No, it is more than that, it is my passion. I think I am very blessed because of that. Very few people can say that about their career paths and even fewer understand the passion I have.

      Independence Day. One might say that this is a very important day in our country's history. This is the day we declared our independence from England. For me, a lowly student at Pfizer, it's just another day I don't get paid for. So, I went into work when I got up. I didn't drive into work, I biked into work. It's at least a 4 mile trip each way. It was a little tougher than I thought it would be. I don't think it would have been so bad but this town is so darn hilly that it felt like I was constantly going uphill. But it was a good work out and I feel good right now. I just don't think I'll be biking to work again real soon.  I'm so happy. Jon came down for the night. I am always so happy to see him. We had a good night. He took me out to dinner at TGI Fridays. Fridays is my ultimate favorite restaurant. It was cool because he doesn't take me out that often. Then we bought a game at Meijer's, so we plated that all night. It was a good night with Jon.

      So, my frustrations at work continue. Greg came and told me he can't find the data on the 23 compounds so I think I'm going to have to repeat those compounds. It really makes me mad. No, it really pisses me off. This guy is really incompetent. I don't understand how he could have stuck around so long. He probably should be fired. But what can I do?  So, my friend Christina called me last night. She and her boyfriend, Dave, got engaged. I'm really happy for her. They are getting married December 29. In a way it kind of bothers me that they are getting married before we are. It wouldn't matter if they had actually been dating more than a year. It just bothers me because ever since Jon and I got engaged she has been saying that her and Dave were probably going to get married before we did. It's just, Jon and I have been together so much longer. But I  am  happy for her.  I'm a little bummed because tomorrow is the 4th of July and I was really hoping that Jon would come down. But, apparently he told his uncle he would help him build a dock. I really wanted to see him. Oh well, I'm going to go into work for a few hours anyway. I really need the money.

      Another week of work begins. I'm not very excited because Greg is back. This man makes my job about 100 times more difficult than it ever needs to be. He is a full-time colleague but is the most useless employee on the face of the earth. He doesn't ever do any work. The little bit of work he did do makes me wonder how trustworthy it really is. He has missed compounds that were highly specific. It makes me question all of his data. Before he left he claimed to have given me all of his data and claimed to have tested all the compounds on this list. Well, I can't find data for 23 compounds. He said he tested them. I asked him about it today and at first he was trying to say that they were compounds that compound management didn't have enough to send us. That was his story until I said that I had data on them. All of a sudden he didn't know what happened to them. It was very sketchy! But it concerns me because I don't know what else I'm missing or is wrong or whatever. He is back and he is going to drive me insane.

      Ah, the first of the month. It is almost like a new beginning. You get to turn the page of the calendar. Any time I turn a page I feel like I am starting anew. That's why I like a new month. See, this way I can make it like a new year. Well, sort of. I started off the month of July by celebrating my friend Amanda's 21st birthday. We all met at Charley's for dinner. I decided that since I was one of the few that was also 21, I would have a drink with her. Lisa convinced me to order a Purple Rain. It had almost every kind of alcohol imaginable: vodka, rum, gin, tequila and a raspberry liqueur. It didn't taste too bad but it was a VERY strong drink.

      Well, I am approaching the point of school starting. In all honesty, I am about ready. Jon is gone so really what else is there for me to do right now? I know once school starts I'm not going to be happy and will wish it was summer again, that is the way things always seem to work. Yesterday, Amanda and I walked up to the bookstore to see about our books. I ended up getting mine. I was so happy, it only took me one trip to the bookstore and only one bookstore and my books cost less that $200. I was so very pumped about that. I have to say that it was really nice to have Amanda staying with me. Lisa is in California this week so I would have been all alone otherwise. Amanda and I don't get to hang out so much anymore and that is a little sad but we did this week so that was really cool. I think we'll have to figure something out where we can study together or do something similar to that.

      I really need to work on my listening ability. I don't mean my ability to listen to people but my ability to listen to God. I want to make sure that I am really listening and that I truly know that I am hearing Him and not my own voice. I know that if I just do the right things this will come to me over time. In order to hear God's voice I know I must do five things: 1. Stay in close fellowship with God 2. Listen to Christian radio and music more. 3. Read books that will guide me into deeper spiritual understanding 4. Ask for and apply advice from Christians I respect. 5. Read God's Word I really need to focus on this because by doing so it will strengthen me and my relationship with God.  I was very happy because Jon called me tonight. I'm really missing him. There is really nothing I dislike more than not being with him. In 10 months though, I will finally be able to be with him always. It really is what gets me through not being with me. It's funny because now that Jon has gone back to school I almost want school to just hurry up and start. I think about getting married and the sooner school starts the sooner it is over and the sooner I get married. That is what I am looking forward to.

      Which of the spiritual disciplines of prayer, Bible reading, memorization and mediation am I lacking?  I feel like I'm doing well in all those disciplines except for memorization. I can recite a few verses but not much more than that. I know how important it is but when I have to memorize so much for school it almost feels like it is just one more thing. Memorization is so important too and it really is much more than just another thing. It just is difficult with my life-style. The Bible talks about how important it is to have God's word in your heart so that you may call upon it wherever you are and whatever you are doing. This is clearly a place that needs work.  Jon returned to school this morning. Thankfully he made it safely. He called me when he got there. That meant that I was at church by myself. It was sad not having him there beside me. Also, in church I was very glad that last night we decided to wait on having sex. I was sitting there and this calming peace came over me. I felt like God had just told me that He was so proud of Jon and I for overcoming the temptation and doing what God wanted us to do. It was really a great feeling.  Speaking of great feelings, I got to spend time with Jacob today. I love that little guy. He makes me so happy. A hug from him is the greatest thing. He just holds on so tight and it just feels so good. We had a shower for Jen (my cousin Chad's fiance) and Jacob came up with Uncle Dave and David. I played with him. We rode the elevator and pretended that we were a train. Of course we had to smell all the flowers. He really is just a little bundle of joy and excitement. I really just love to be around him.

      Today was my last day with Jon. You would almost think that it would have gotten easier, as this is now the fourth time we have had to say good-bye. But strangely, it doesn't. I guess that this is what happens when you are in love with someone. We started off the day by getting a mirror for my car since the passenger's side one got ripped off. So, Jon fixed that for me. We went to dinner at Clara's so that was really nice. After dinner we went back to Jon's house. His parents were gone and we started out just watching TV. But later we migrated to his bedroom. In there we discussed having sex. Over spring break this year we started to but after like a minute we both decided that we didn't want to. This time we were really, really contemplating this. It was a struggle because we both wanted to have sex but we both knew that it was wrong. That was where our indecisiveness was. I though about how I would feel sitting in church tomorrow if we did. I am not sure if I could knowing that the night before we had so blatantly sinned. This was the ultimate deciding factor in our decision not to. So this time we were able to overcome temptation.

      So begins my last weekend with Jon. It really was a rather sad thought. Tonight was good though. We started it off with our second meeting with Pastor Fowler. He actually showed up this time so that was a definite plus. We were going over the results of the personality test that we took for ourselves as well as for each other. It was interesting because we both seem to be the same. The only significant difference between the two of us was that I am way more self-disciplined than Jon is. Pastor Fowler did not really see any place that was going to cause major problems in our marriage. That is awesome to think that we shouldn't have much as far as problems go. I like Pastor Fowler so we were just able to sit and talk with him for a couple hours. After that we went to Amy and Chris's. It was nice to see the people that I went to high school with but at the same time I was kind of glad to not be seeing them all the time. Amy and Sarah were really the only two that I wanted to spend any time with.

      In what way do I struggle with being discontent? Earlier this summer I was extremely unhappy and depressed. From some reason I could not see any of the good that existed in my life. There was nothing for me to be depressed about, but I was. Since then I have pulled God back into my life in a strong way and things are looking a lot better.  Why is it so hard to be content? What message does the world keep bombarding me with? In the society we live in it always seems to be about "keeping up with the Joneses." It tells you that in order to be successful you have to have the biggest and best of everything. Since we live in a world where everything is quickly changing it is difficult to keep up and that is what leads so many people to being discontent.  How can I keep from wishing my life away? The best way to avoid is to make sure that God is an active part of my life. By doing this He will help me to appreciate what I do have. He will help me focus on the present and not leave me dreaming about the future.  Jon goes back to Tech on Sunday. That makes me so sad. I know that this is the last time but it still doesn't make things any easier. I miss him so much. It will really take a lot to keep me from crying on Saturday. I'll just have to keep reminding myself that this is the last time.

      If I were in this man's place, what would I have to go through to be able to forgive? How can I tell if I have forgiven or not forgiven someone?  It is a very difficult question to answer because I have no idea what I would do in a situation where someone killed a person close to me in cold blood. Especially if they have no remorse. I know eventually I would have to forgive them according to  urlLink Matthew 6:14-15 . However, it is definitely something that would take time for me to get past. I think that is okay though. You must take some time to grieve and feel the pain. After that you can reach the point of forgiveness. I think the best way to tell if you have or haven't forgiven someone based on how I feel around them. For example, if I still feel intense anger and remorse I know that I haven't truly forgiven them.  I found out some rather poor news today. My friend Amy called me because a group of us were going to get together on Friday for Sunshine's 21st birthday. Sunshine was my best friend growing up. But as we got older she started to get involved with things that I didn't want a part of. So we have grown apart. Two years ago she had a daughter. Well, Amy told me today that Sunshine is pregnant once again. But this time could really be trouble. She is five months along and apparently just found out like two weeks ago. She was using that shot where you don't have your period. I guess she had two or three of these since she has been pregnant and that can really screw up a child. She also has been drinking and doing drugs while she was pregnant. Chances are this is going to be a seriously messed up child. It just makes me so sad.

      What would I most like to change about my life during this school year? What is the biggest obstacle I face in making that change? Who might enter a pact with me to work toward spiritual change?  First of all, I want to go to church on Sundays when I am down at school. That is something I have been struggling with. It is very intimidating to go alone to a new church. But, I must remember that God will be going with me. The second thing I want to change or I guess continue is the right word is my devotionals. I want to devote an hour each night as my "God Time" and just read my Bible and pray. I think this will help me to be more focused on school. I must keep my focus on God when classes start again.  In making these changes I have to say that laziness is going to be my biggest obstacle. I have to resist the urge to just keep on sleeping on Sunday morning. I have to resist the nap that I might want to take instead of doing my God Time. I will have to start drawing my energy out of my time with God. I will use the spiritual energy I get from my hour with God.  Jon and I are going to work together for our spiritual motivation. It will be difficult with the distance but with us praying for each other we should be able to overcome this.

      1. What is my view of alcohol? Do I try to use God's Word to justify my desires or to guide my thinking? 2. If I do drink, could I stop? If so, will I?    Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.   -Ephesians 5:18 (NIV)     This verse is saying that the Spirit empowers for worship, service and testimony. One can be under an influence that affects him, whether of wine or of the Spirit. A happy, mutual encouragement to praise God and a healthy, mutual relationship with people. If you are affected by alcohol you will not have this life. I drink every once in a while. It is far from everyday and really not even once a week. The Bible always talks about the abuse of alcohol or being drunk. I come no where near the point of abuse and I've never been drunk. I think that alcohol in moderation is fine but once you start abusing you are in trouble. I know that if someone told me I could never have alcohol again I would have no problem with that. So, I must say that for me, alcohol is not a problem.

      This took be back a bit to my relationship with Andy. It was about faithfulness. I remember how horrible I felt with that whole situation (forgive me for not going into details but it's not all that important.) It leads to God's faithfulness and in turn my faithfulness to God. Over time, it has become quite clear to me that God really is the only "person" I can truly count on regardless of what happens and that is a wonderful thing. But, at the same time, I also must be faithfulness and you cannot love someone without being 100% faithful to them. God will always provide me with that kind of love and so I in turn must try to do the same for Him. I feel that I have this love for Jon and I would certainly hope that he feels the same way.

      My devotional today asked a few really good questions that were really making me think about myself. It was focusing on the beatitudes of Christ. It spoke about the key areas of life change:  1. Poor in spirit: Am I humble and broken before God and others? I have to say that I think that we can always be more humble before God and others. I make sure not to brag about myself in front of others. I also know that everything I have ever accomplished in my life has been with God and only because I had the Lord's help.  2. Mourn: Do I grieve about sin or do I swim in it? I have tried to keep my life as sinless as possible. But I know that I sin and "fall short of the glory of God."  3. Meek: Are my power and drives under God's control? In my life, I believe that my career choice has been God leading me down the path that He has chosen for me. I try to make my decisions based on what God wants me to do.  4. Hunger for Righteousness: Is my deepest passion for Christ alone? I think that this is an area for me to work on. I am getting better and my drive and passion for Christ is getting to be much greater. I am truly nearing the point where all I want is to please him.  5. Merciful: Are other people aware of the grace and mercy I show to others? I need to make other people much more aware of my relationship with God. This will also be helpful with witnessing. Perhaps someone would say wow, she is doing great, how? My answer can be through God, how else?  6. Pure in heart: Is what I watch, what I read, and what I say appropriate and pleasing to God? One of my problems is with swearing. It is something I have been focusing on for a while so I've gotten better but I'm still not quite there.  7. Peacemaker: Do I seek peace or conflict in my relationships? I think I really ten to go more toward the peace end. I am not one to go fishing for conflict.  I think that for everyone there is always room to become a better Christian. That is something I am focusing on in my life.

      Today was a very busy day. I'm not real sure what it is about my weekends lately but they have been everything but relaxing. Although, I did get to sleep in a bit. But once I got up it was on the go. We had Jacob's birthday party today. Jacob loves trains. When I was about three Grandpa Don made me a train for Christmas. It was one that you could sit on and schooch around on. So, Jon and I cleaned it all off and repainted it to give to Jacob. We also bought him a children's Bible and Jon wanted to get him Veggie Tales videos. Jacob liked his train but I'm not sure he really knew what exactly to think about it. It was a whole lot of excitement for the little guy. After we were all done with Jacob's presents we were playing with the kids. There were a whole bunch of little ones for Jacob to play with. Jon and I were playing with them. They were all trying to get Jon. I had to get in there and help them out. They were loving it. I was standing off to the side and David said, "Heather, you don't have to worry about Jon not being a good parent." I know that Jon will be a really good father just by watching the way he is around Jacob and Ellie.

      Jon and I had our first session with Pastor Fowler tonight. It comes at a time when we are struggling. I just want to be able to talk with Jon about where I am spiritually. I feel like I have really changed my life a great deal these last couple of months and I am feeling much more happy than I was before. I was needing my relationship with God to be better and I have that now. But it is really bothering me that I cannot share this with Jon. He is the one person with whom I want to share this. I want to sit and talk to him about our walk with God. It makes me so excited and I really want Jon to share in this excitement with me. I think that unless we can fix this on our own this may be a topic to discuss with Pastor Fowler. I think he could help.

      When I look at others, do I usually consider how much better  I  am than they are, or do I look at them and commend the ways  they  surpass me? Am I tempted to think that admiring others will hurt my own self-image?  The very answer to these questions should come from this verse:    Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourself.   -Philippians 2:3 (NIV)     I have found that lately I am not as quick to judge others. When I see people I am focusing on looking past what would cause a non-Christian to cast judgment. I do need to work on seeing the areas these people are better than me. I think that a big part of humility has come from recognizing where my personal weakness are also recognizing when someone else kicks my butt. There is this woman in the Pfizer Bible study that is so excited and passionate about God that is almost makes me feel like a bad Christian. But I know that I should strive for her conviction. I am so pleased that she is that in touch with God and it is a level that I wish to achieve. However, to get there I must not let myself be tied down by worldly obstacles and distractions. This is a weakness of mine and I must work on overcoming all this and work on listening much more closely to God.

      I think I'll start by talking about a couple verses that jumped out at me today.    I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."   John 14:6 (NIV)     This verse is saying that Jesus is not one way among many, but it is  the  way. This is really the fundamental basis of Christianity. It is important to always remember that the truth comes through Jesus Christ.  The other verse is a very important one:    Do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God.  Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.   -3 John 11 (NIV)     This verse is saying that we must continually practice doing good, not just merely doing the occasional good deed. I know that is something I find difficult. I always strive to live a good life and do things that are right and good in the Lord's eyes but sometimes I'll find myself giving into world temptations. As a Christian, I know that I can always be better and do more good and that is something I must focus on and strive to achieve. I know that by studying the Bible and through prayer God will help me make that easier for me.

      Today's devotional talked about giving. Last week, I made the decision to give money every week that I go to Jon's church. I figure I'll just cut back on the amount I spend during the week so that I can give to the church. I've always kind of been one that likes to give. After I give I feel so good. My parents celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary. I gave them a camera. They were so pleased and it made them so happy that it was entirely worth the money I spent.  This was another busy weekend. Yesterday, Jon and I met with Brenda to talk about wedding cakes. This is who Jon and I are having do our cake. She is cheap and does a really nice job. So, that was the morning. All afternoon was the anniversary party for Jon's parents so we spent most of the time setting up and cleaning up. Then today was church and spending time with my family. We saw Julie, Jacob and Ellie. Those two are my favorite to be around. They really make things feel so nice and happy.

      In what ways do I let others set my values and agenda? What will help me reject the pressure of the crowd and do what God wants?  I think that I have done a pretty good job throughout my life at not giving into peer pressure. Throughout high school and now into college, I haven't gotten drunk or experienced drugs. I've never even taken a puff of a cigarette. Lots of things have kept me from having these "typical" teenage experiences. One of the biggest has been my faith and how it has taught me not to follow the crowd but rather stand on my own two feet and beat my own path. I've also avoided this because I really have no desire to loose control of my body and mind the way these substances make you. A lot of time, I don't drink for the sole purpose that my friends want me to. I refuse because they want me to. The more they push the less likely I am to cave into them. The way I was raised has really made me the way I am. After I turned 21 I have had some drinks with friends but not because they pressured. This is the way I have decided to live my life.  After I woke up this morning, I drove home and stopped at Aunt Carole's. We had an all day scrapbooking marathon so to speak. I enjoy doing this with Aunt Carole. It is like our little bonding moment. I spent the night at Jon's house, although I am not feeling well. I kind of wanted to stay at home but Jon wouldn't let me. But what can I say?

      Let me start with a verse and then I will go on from there:    But we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perserverence, perserverence character, and character hope. And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given to us.   -Romans 5:3-5    This verse is saying that a Christian can rejoice in suffering because they know that it is not meaningless. Part of God's purpose is to produce character in his children. It goes right along with the fact that God never gives us more than we can handle. Even though at the time it may feel like it, we can rest assured that He would never do that.  Questions for thought: 1. Have I ever tried to add anything to the Gospel? 2. If I've already accepted Christ as Savior, what should be my response to the Gospel?  I'll address the first question separately from the second. I think that most people want to alter the Gospel a little bit in order to "make it apply to today's world." I know that there have been times when I have wanted to do the same thing. But, when I stop and think about it, I realize that is ridiculous and that the Bible  does  apply to today. We have no need to try and fix things.  As a Christian my response to the Gospel should always be that it is the truth and the law. I should not want to change things. I should love every part of the Gospel because it is God's Word and I want to walk in accordance with God, therefore, I should love every aspect of His Word. Even if at times my human nature would like me to do otherwise. I think that the stronger your relationship with God, the easier that becomes. I think that helps you to see that you are living a good Christian life and that you are walking strong with Him.

      So today involved our long trek back from Tech. It was overall a good weekend. I was in fact sad to see it end which I am taking as a very good sign. Especially when you take into account the way I was feeling before I made this trip. So we left this morning around 11. That led Amanda and I to roll into Ann Arbor around 8 pm. The drive just consumes your entire day and that really stinks. When I got home I was very unhappy to be here. I was really missing Jon. This I also took to be a good sign. I was so sad that I really couldn't even focus enough to do my work. But like I said I think that is a good sign that this weekend helped me.

      I was very happy because Jon was at class and I was able to get some of my own studying done. Going away for the weekend has some affect on that. But I got stuff done so that is a very good thing. Jon had planned a big night for us. He took me out to dinner at the Northern Lights. It is this restaurant on the top floor of the Best Western in Houghton. It has all these windows and we had a table by the window. They overlook the Portage and we had a really nice view. After dinner we had tickets to see Branford Marsalis. He is a jazz saxophone player. We had seats in the third row. It was pretty cool. My stomach got real bad toward the end of it. So I had to skip out early. I don't know what it is about my stomach or why it has to do that. Something else happened that I completely did not expect to happen. It all happened so quickly but it still happened. I guess I should just say it...Jon and I made love. I'm not going to say we had sex because there was much more emotion behind it than just physical pleasure. It was very strange. We didn't go the full time but it was definitely beyond the virgin threshold. I must say I did not expect that to happen. I don't regret it but I don't want it to happen again until we are married.

      Today involved me and Amanda driving up to Tech. That is a long drive. It takes nine hours to get there. We left at noon and didn't get here until 9 pm. I hadn't told Jon about my knee situation so he found out when I get there. He saw me and said, "Why do you have crutches?" He did act like he cared which I personally took as a good sign. So, that was a start. But we had a lot to talk about. So we stayed up late talking. I told him how I had been feeling about my inability to tell him things. I told him that it went all the way back to September 11 and the national tragedy. I said this was a problem since we are getting married and I shouldn't feel uncomfortable telling my husband personal and serious things. He agreed and said he would really try to be better about it. But on that same thought, I'm going to have to work on opening myself up to him again. I guess it will take some time but I am hoping soon I'll get past it.

      I was a little nervous being at the football game this afternoon. There were just an awful lot of people in a pretty confined space. In my current walking condition it would have been trouble trying to get out in a hurry. Thank God nothing happened. At the start of the game we observed a moment of silence. That was pretty cool to have 110,000 people just shut up and not say a word. At half-time the bands played a tribute to America. Our band's formation was an eagle, it looked really cool. Then both bands got together and played  America the Beautiful  and we also sung along. It was pretty moving. Then some band members came out on the field with a huge American flag. I almost felt like crying. Our country has just really come together. At the game they handed out red and blue pom-poms. I got one of course. After the band did its thing, everyone in the stadium starting chanting, "USA!" I really almost cried. I've never been so proud to be an American.

      I went to the doctor today. I am having too much pain. I don't know maybe I'm just a wuss but I want this over with. So, this morning I spent three hours at UHS. They x-rayed my knee so the bones look okay but I'm supposed to go to physical therapy next Wednesday and I have an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon in a month. I don't know what I am going to do, I'm in Chad's wedding in a month and my heels are huge! I had to tell my mom about it. I haven't told Jon yet and I don't think I'm going to. He can just find out when I go up there next weekend. Telling him will do no good. Its not like he even cares that much. So, I tell him and then he will get annoyed just like when I get sick. Jon just does not rate very high on the compassion scale. I can't talk to him about anything and that could be a major problem. How can I marry a person I can't even talk to? That will be a discussion item for next weekend, without a doubt.  The president spoke tonight about our country's current position. He said that there will be a military attack on Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan if they continue to harbor him. I'm scared. I'm scared of what our retaliation could lead to. Who would we piss off? I'm scared for our nation's security. Will we ever truly feel safe again? Or is that something that the terrorists took from us? I'm scared to go to the football game Saturday. Is it over? Would Michigan Stadium be the next target? Why would it? Why not? I'm scared of war. Would there be a draft? Would Jon get taken? I'm scared of how long this could last. Will I ever know peace again? Will my children? I'm scared of the state of being our nation could be in. Will we live the rest of our lives in fear? I'm scared for all the victims families. Will the over 6,000 missing ever be found? Or will they just be assumed dead? I'm scared for Misty. Will I see her again? I'm scared for my life. What things will forever be changed? I'm scared for my freedom. Will what our fathers that founded this great nation strove for and fought for and died for be forever lost, as if it never existed at all?

      My knee is quite swollen this morning. It is rather sore and I'm not able to put much weight down on it. It has not been fun hobbling around trying to get from class to class. If it hasn't gotten better by Friday, I need to go to UHS and get it checked out. I really, really hope that it is nothing severe. This is just not something I needed right now. I was not a happy camper because it rained all day! It just figures that it would be pouring with my knee hurting and lead to making my life rather difficult. It was really no fun trying to get around work with my bum knee. This all and all is rather a pain. No pun intended. The common theme in my life is when it rains, it pours. Everything starts to go wrong all at once for me. I'm not real sure why that is. But enough of me and my sob story for today.

      It has been a week. I woke up this morning and prayed that this Tuesday will be less eventful than last Tuesday. It has been a week and over 5,000 people are reported missing in New York. Rescue crews continue to dig through the rubble that was once the World Trade Center. There is now little hope to find someone alive. But they continue to look. Thousands of families are still searching for closure while knowing their closure will most likely come with a body. I feel so useless, so I do the best thing I can, I pray. I've been praying for families, the rescue workers, the victims and the president. What else can I do? What else can anyone do? I thank God that this Tuesday's events did not lead to such a national disaster.  In my own life I was able to have a bit of fun. I played soccer with Alex tonight. But the fun was short-lived when I hyper-extended my knee. It was my knee that I had surgery on. I hope that it is nothing severe.

      It is amazing to think how much things have changed in the last week.  How drastically different we have all become.  The US is once again a truly united nation.  Everywhere I see red, white and blue.  There is a new level of brotherhood and a patriotic atmosphere.  A week ago The  Pledge of Alligiance  was not allowed in schools because of the separation of church and state and  the Pledge  said God.  Today,  God Bless America  is being sung at every major league baseball game along with the national anthem.  Oh yes, how quickly things can change.  Who would have thought a week ago that our nation would find itself in such peril?  Who knew that so much would change?  President Bush wanted this week to be a return to normal.  But what is normal now?  The skyline of this great nation has forever been changed, so I ask only this:  will anything be  normal  again?

      The president has declared today a national day of mourning and prayer for the victims and the victims' families. My evolution class was cancelled today because it was at noon and that is when the prayer service was supposed to happen. Christina and I decided that we would go elsewhere and mourn together. We went to Einstein's Bagels and got something to eat since we both had class at one. We were done eating and we were sitting talking about this week's events when a man came up and put his hand on my shoulder. He has asked me how I was and I answered. As he walked to get in line he put a piece of paper down on our table. At first I didn't think anything of it until I read the paper. It started out saying that women were no good and that they are deceitful and all this other horrible stuff. It got a little scary when you take into account Tuesday's events. So, Christina and I decided that we needed to leave. It very strange and very scary.  Since the football game was cancelled this weekend, I decided to go home and be with my family. I think that is the best place for me to be right now.

      The country is continuing to move about in a daze. We are back to work but really just going through the motions. The television is still filled with images from Tuesday's attack. I am personally finding it very difficult to concentrate on anything. It is such a chore for me to have to study. I do it but I think that I am pulling very little out of it. Our president and his officials are looking for the evil mastermind behind our devastation. The prime suspect is a Saudi multimillionaire, Osama bin Laden. President Bush has declared this a war on terrorism and the entire country wants to see a full-scale military strike against whoever did this. I say, if bin Laden is responsible and Afghanistan won't give him up, then we go make Afghanistan a crater.  The NFL cancelled it's games this weekend and college football did the same. I am really glad they did. I would have been a little afraid to have gone and sat in Michigan Stadium with 110,000 other people. Just something about that would have made me slightly uncomfortable. I was glad for all the athletes as well. So many of them are very against playing and I don't blame them at all. How could you expect the New York Jets to get on a plane to California? How could the New York Giants play with the still smoking remains of the World Trade Center visible from the stadium? How could the Washington Redskins even think of taking the field with the Pentagon in it's condition? So, for this weekend, no sports will be played in America. I think of Marcella and how badly she must want to be with Josh during this time. I don't know if she will be able to be with him this week but I hope she is. I know how badly I want Jon's comfort and support in this time.

      We all woke up to a different America this morning. It was an America where no planes were flying overhead. Everything was strangely quiet this morning and today. The birds didn't even sing, like they knew. I'm not sure there is a person in this country that slept well last night. Our blanket of safety is gone and who knows if it will ever return. I think if it does it will take a great deal of time. Things were different. At work this morning I had to drive through three security checkpoints. You know, Monday that probably would have bothered me but this morning, I had no problem with it at all. I'm quite certain that no one else did either. I really am afraid that it isn't completely over. Today was Lisa's and my friend's Elizabeth's 21st birthday. We went to Charley's for a surprise party. I really felt like I should not be happy and celebrating anything with what happened yesterday. I do not know how people could be laughing and having a good time with TVs in the background showing the plane crashing into the tower. It disturbed me greatly. I just want to feel safe again.

      This date will forever be remembered. It will go down in history like December 7, 1941. This morning around 8:40 am a commercial airliner ran into one of the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. The plane was en route from Boston to LA. It exploded on impact. Approximately 18 minutes later, a second airliner hit the second tower. At this point in time we were all aware that this was no longer an accident. I was driving home in my car when I heard this. I was on my way home from work to go to my evolution discussion. It was while I was in my car that the next disaster occurred. Around 9:30 am a third plane hit the Pentagon (the center of our defense). These planes were hijacked by terrorists. Around 10:30 am, the first tower of the World Trade Center collapsed, not long after that tower collapsed the second tower collapsed. When the first tower collapsed some 200 fire-fighters were inside with a rescue effort. About 50,000 people work in the twin towers of the World Trade Center. In the course of a few hours the skyline of New York City and of our country was forever changed. A fourth hijacked plane crashed in Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh. This plane crashed in a field. For the first time ever the FAA (in charge of airlines) grounded all flights and emptied the skies over this great nation. This is being called the worst act of terrorism on US soil. It is the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor. At least in Pearl Harbor we knew who did it. They have their suspicions. One is Osama bin Ladin. This man is the leader of a terrorist group that has had other attacks against the US, embassy bombing and attack on the USS Cole. He is denying any involvement in this attack. Afghanistan is harboring him. The president has said that "we will make no difference between those responsible and the countries that harbor them." Our country is in turmoil. For the first time in quite a long time the University of Michigan cancelled classes. Federal buildings sent all their employees home. The country shut down and huddled around televisions waiting to hear what news may come.  I had gone to my Shakespeare discussion to make sure that classes were infact cancelled. My GSI had not heard. He was in shock. I felt so horrible when he said that he had a friend that worked in the World Trade Center. I have been praying for them.  I had another terrifying experience when I went to get gas. I had the radio on and a man came on asking about flights and if they were grounded. They said that all flights were grounded and nothing is in the air. So, the guy said that there was a plane circling Ann Arbor. I looked out my car window and sure enough, there was a plane flying overhead. I watched it as it turned almost ninety degrees. It was very scary. I do not know what it was doing or anything like that.  I am scared. Never in my life has anything like this happened. This is huge and I'm afraid that it's not over. I'm afraid that we may go to war. I am honestly terrified of what a third world war would bring. With technology now it could bring about pure disaster. I am afraid that if there is a war there will be a draft. I am afraid that a draft would take away Jon and Chad. The blast of the World Trade Center almost did take away Chad. He used to work for Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley held some 50 floors in one of the towers. They had talked of transferring Chad to New York. Thank God he was fired. This is all so crazy. It's almost too crazy to be believable. Watching what happened in New York and Washington feels like watching a movie. It is just unreal. We no longer live in a country that is safe and that is frightening. One of the most moving things I saw about tonight was the entire US Congress, democrat and republican alike, standing on the capital steps singing, "God Bless America." That, along with the image of the second plane hitting the tower, will forever be etched into my memory. There are so many images that I will never forget. I know I'm not alone. Every American will never forget the images of today. This is our generation's big event. Our grandparents talk about Pearl Harbor, our parents talk about JFK's assassination, we are going to talk about this. Someday our children and grandchildren are going to learn about this in their history class and they are going to come and ask it about it. I truly hope that this is all of the story we have to tell. Tomorrow, we will wake up in a different world.

      I brought Lisa, Amanda, and Christina home so that we can pick out our bridesmaid dresses. Amy drove over to my house and joined us. Before we headed to Lett's we went to Aunt Carole's so that they all could see my wedding dress. They all seemed to like it. We went into Lett's and we were able to pick out a dress that they all liked. I was happy because the color it came in was almost exactly how I had pictured it. I was also happy that they could all agree on a dress and that the price was really reasonable. Now, Julie and Jon's sisters have to go and get fitted for the dress. The dress is really something I had in my mind. I'm really happy that my wedding planning is going as well as it is. After we picked out the dress we had lunch at Clara's. On the way home a rainbow almost caused a 50-car pile-up and we were almost part of it. It was not cool at all.

      Even after a short week the weekend is still very welcome. I'm not sure why that is. I guess a weekend of good rest is always needed. Tonight, Lisa and I went to the Evans Scholar's party. It wasn't as much fun as they usually are. We almost felt out of place because we are seniors. It is definitely more fun when just a few of us get together and hang out in Andy's room or something. I felt bad because Andy is the president and had to watch the door the whole time. After the party, Lisa and I wanted pizza so we got some from Bell's and boy did it really hit the spot. We saw Greg on our way back. He is being such a jerk to Lisa because she hung out with one of his roommates this summer. Greg is such a jerk. I never did like that boy. But overall, I'd say it was a good night.

      If I had to pick one thing in my life that would be likely to pull me from God it would have to be this university. I think this for two reasons. First, school is a lot of work and I get really busy. That makes it a lot more difficult to take time out of my day to spend with God. The second reason is that so few people at this school are Christians and whether we like it or not, it can be taxing on your faith. That is why I have to really concentrate on keeping close to God.  I only had one class today. It was viral pathogenesis. I was really worried about it because of what I had heard from people who took it last year. But the professor modified the class and got rid of the ten page grant proposal so I'm a lot less worried about that now. I really am going to try and stay on top of things this semester.

      How is my relationship with God?  Over the past couple months the relationship I've had with God has gotten stronger. I began to spend more and more time reading and really studying His Word and it has greatly improved my relationship with Him. I feel much closer to Him now than I did at the beginning of the summer. And my life outlook has drastically improved. Which just goes to show that by maintaining that strong relationship with Him, He helps you out here. I'm really not sure how I could possibly get through my life without God's help. Things in this world are just too difficult to try and face alone. I am nothing without God and His strength and guidance without Him I am a failure.  Today was my first day of classes of my last year here. I had three classes today: Shakespeare plays, Evolution and Infectious Diseases. So here are my thoughts: Shakespeare Plays: I think this is going to be a great class. Dr. Williams is the professor and he is fabulous so I am excited about this one. Evolution: I knew I was going to dislike this class and I think I'm going to be correct. One plus, Christina is in the class. Infectious Diseases: I think this will be interesting. I like this stuff, what can I say? So those were today, we'll see how things pan out this semester.

      Today marks the end of the summer, which in a way is a little bit depressing. We had a gathering for my family at my aunt's house. My family does that a lot. That is really one of the things that I really like about my family. I love how close we all are. It really is a rare thing to find a family that is a close as mine. Sometimes people from the outside find a problem with this. I'm really not sure why that is. I don't know if part of it is them being jealous because they never had anything like that. I like it but part of me knows that this closeness is going to make my life a lot more difficult very soon. In a few months, I must make a decision about graduate school. It is a decision that will involve me moving away from them. That will definitely be hard for me to do. Although, I must say it is Jacob that I will miss the most. It is him that would hurt the most for me to leave. I really don't know what it is about that little boy that makes me so attached. I really love that little boy.

      Why does it always seem like there is a dread to starting the month of September? Each new month is welcomed with open arms, but not September. Perhaps part of it has to do with school starting. I'm not looking forward to it because I see where I have come spiritually over the summer and I do not want to lose that simply because school has started. So, I guess that really leaves me to my spiritual goals for this 2001-2002 school year.  First, I want to continue to be in church each Sunday. This may not be as simple a goal as it might sound. It is very difficult to go to a new church alone. It is something that forces you out of your comfort zone. Next, Sunday I will be at school and I am hoping that with the Lord's helping hand I can go. I will need His help though. My second, goal is to continue with my devotionals each night and be able to spend an hour a night reading the Bible, meditating on His Word and praying. My third goal is to try and continue my study of Genesis, just one or two chapters a week is all that I am really aiming for. I will need God's help with keeping these three goals and to help keep me from wavering. With His help and guidance I will succeed.  Well, along with school starting September marks the beginning of something much more fun... FOOTBALL!!!  Today was Michigan's first game. It was against Miami of Ohio. We won 31-13. Since Lisa was in California she wasn't going to be using her ticket, so I took my dad instead. He had never been to a game before but I think he really enjoyed it. There is really nothing quite like a University of Michigan football game. There is just something about 100,000 people all singing the same fight song that is surreal. There is just something about a facility that holds over 110,000 people that is incredible. There really is just something about Michigan football game. It is incredible because on game day the entire city is united behind a maize and blue flag. Students, alumni, faculty and just die hard fans alike all march to the beat of the same tune..."The Victors." There is truly no experience like that surrounding Michigan football. I must say that I'm glad to have been there for the last three and soon to be four years.

      I’ve still not figured out what exactly made my life into a “daytime drama.”  This is all so insane.  Ryan called me tonight but how can I bring up this over the phone.  This was something that I wanted to talk about in person.  But who knows, maybe it just wasn’t meant to be.  I spent an hour on the phone with my aunt.  She was much more helpful than what my mom was.  She had an idea and was able to give me at least some advice.  I have a decision to make.  It involves either waiting this out a little bit, postponing the wedding or calling off the engagement and re-evaluating all of this in the summer.  We also agreed that this weekend is not going to be time for me to make this decision.  This weekend will just be a step.  Aunt Carole also suggested that maybe we take this to Pastor Fowler and get the advice of an unrelated third party.  I will definitely be spending some time in deep meditation and prayer to get all of this figured out.  I will be searching for God’s answer.  We also came to the decision that tomorrow I’m not going to think about this and just “pamper” myself.  Please God, give me an answer.

      So I had e-mailed Ryan last night and tonight he showed up at my house.  Unfortunately, he was not alone so I couldn’t talk to him about this little problem that I am having.  I really feel like I need to be addressing this with him.  Although, I must admit that there was a great deal less attraction then normal.  Maybe that was because his friend was here.  I’m not really sure.  I am struggling to keep my focus on things and it is getting really hard right now.  I had no desire what so ever to go to class today.  But I did go.  I am finding studying rather difficult and I need to overcome that so I can get on with my life and get some things back to normal.  I want all my regular routines back and stuff to be normal once again.  Ah, the return to normal, something I am still working on.  Hopefully soon.

      I’m getting nowhere with this Jon thing.  It is so frustrating because I’m on my own with this.  I am seriously feeling very lonely right now.  I just want to know that everything will work out.  But I don’t know that right now.  I don’t have a clue what is going to happen.  I feel so depressed.  Amanda is really the only person I can talk to about this but I don’t want to be bothering her all the time.  I just wish I could go to sleep and have the dreams to end all dreams.  One that just tells me what I am supposed to do.  But in reality I need to just keep praying and be patient and God will reveal to me soon what His will is.  I just need to not freak out until then.  When did my life become a soap opera?  Why can’t I just go on and marry Jon like I was originally supposed to and have that be it?  Why?  Because my life is not that easy!  I need to talk to Ryan soon.

      Well, Jon called me this evening.  He was crying and going on and on about how much he didn’t want to loose me.  It makes me feel so terrible that he was crying.  How am I supposed to figure anything out with him doing that?  He kept saying that he wouldn’t know what do without me and that he can’t loose me.  This is so hard and it seriously makes me feel ill.  I’ve been so depressed all weekend and I really don’t have anyone to talk to.  Jon mentioned something about coming down this weekend.  It was good of him to think of it but I don’t think it is going to completely fix things.  I am just so stressed out with everything right now.  It just seems like my whole world has come crashing down around me.  Very little is going well right now.  All I want is something to be right and for something good and positive to happen.  Right now that isn’t happening and it makes me want to scream.

      This saga of insanity that is my life continues…I called my mom and talked to her about what was going on.  She really did not have anything to tell me.  I want some advice.  Countless times when my friends come to I have advice for them.  Go to Heather, she has all the answers.  Well now I need answers and there is no one here to give them to me.  But my mom did help.  My family thinks Jon is so wonderful and I’m not sure how they could understand that I’m not happy.  But the point is for me to be happy.  My mom told me that it would be okay if I decided not to marry Jon.  I think I need to hear that because knowing that will help me make my decision.  I hope that this is the distance and that is all it is.  I want to marry Jon.  I love Jon.  But I also want to be happy.  So, after I talked to my mom I talked to Jon.  I needed to make him listen to me because he doesn’t always do that.  He needed to stop for a second and think about the possibility that we are not meant to be together.  He does not want to think about that but he has to because I need to know that I’m not making a huge mistake.  I think that is fair for me to want that.  So, we decided, much against Jon’s will, that we would “take a break.”  So we are not going to talk until next Saturday.  But if I decide that I need more time than I can take more time.  So, the question is: what will I do with my week of freedom?  I think I need to sit down and talk to Ryan.  I’m not sure how to approach that but it needs to be done.  This has got to be one of the most horrible things I have ever gone through.  I just feel ill.  I feel ill at the thought of hurting Jon.  I really do love him.  I am so confused that I can’t stand it.  I need to be with him.  Maybe that’s it!  Maybe I’m not unhappy  with  Jon maybe I’m just unhappy not  being  with Jon.  I guess that is what I have this week to figure out.

      This saga of insanity that is my life continues…I called my mom and talked to her about what was going on.  She really did not have anything to tell me.  I want some advice.  Countless times when my friends come to I have advice for them.  Go to Heather, she has all the answers.  Well now I need answers and there is no one here to give them to me.  But my mom did help.  My family thinks Jon is so wonderful and I’m not sure how they could understand that I’m not happy.  But the point is for me to be happy.  My mom told me that it would be okay if I decided not to marry Jon.  I think I need to hear that because knowing that will help me make my decision.  I hope that this is the distance and that is all it is.  I want to marry Jon.  I love Jon.  But I also want to be happy.  So, after I talked to my mom I talked to Jon.  I needed to make him listen to me because he doesn’t always do that.  He needed to stop for a second and think about the possibility that we are not meant to be together.  He does not want to think about that but he has to because I need to know that I’m not making a huge mistake.  I think that is fair for me to want that.  So, we decided, much against Jon’s will, that we would “take a break.”  So we are not going to talk until next Saturday.  But if I decide that I need more time than I can take more time.  So, the question is: what will I do with my week of freedom?  I think I need to sit down and talk to Ryan.  I’m not sure how to approach that but it needs to be done.  This has got to be one of the most horrible things I have ever gone through.  I just feel ill.  I feel ill at the thought of hurting Jon.  I really do love him.  I am so confused that I can’t stand it.  I need to be with him.  Maybe that’s it!  Maybe I’m not unhappy  with  Jon maybe I’m just unhappy not  being  with Jon.  I guess that is what I have this week to figure out.

      So I didn’t talk to Jon last night.  Lisa was on the phone and I was watching the football game.  I’m not real sure why I didn’t get on the computer.  Maybe I just need some time to figure out what I want.  I only wish I knew.  I just do not understand why nothing in my life can ever be easy.  I know there are a lot of people out there that have things a whole lot harder than I do.  But no aspect of my life is easy!  Health:  Well at the moment my left knee doesn’t work.  I also have ulcers in my colon.  Now what does that suggest about easiness.  I have to constantly pay close attention to what I eat or else I end up with diarrhea like 20 minutes later.  School: I have to work to put myself through college and have a place to live and food to eat.  Working takes away from schooling, which in turn makes classes that, much tougher.  Love: Well, I think we know this story by now.  I thought that this was going to be part of my life that was easy but I guess I should have known better.  I keep praying about this but I’m running out of time God.  Why did Ryan have to tell me all this?  Why does Ryan have to be so wonderful?  Why can’t Jon be the way he used to be?  Why can’t I just be happy?  I need to talk to my mom about this.  I’ve been talking to Amanda about this and she is really the only I can because I can’t talk to Lisa.  If it didn’t involve Ryan I could.  The thing is…everyone thinks Jon is the perfect guy.  But I’m not sure if he is perfect for me.  Is there something wrong with me?  Or is this just cold feet?   HELP ME!

      I was thrown last night.  Late last night Lisa, Alex, Ryan and I went to Fridays for an appetizer and drinks.  Of course there was the intense flirting there always is between Ryan and I.  The problem is: the more Ryan and I flirt, the more I want him.  It is getting so hard for me not to kiss him.  This is a problem.  This is a huge problem.  It makes me wonder how ready I am to get married.  I also wonder what would happen if Ryan and I were alone together, besides in my car.  Part of me thinks it would be best for me to avoid that situation completely.  But then, this other part of me is dying to find out what would happen.  I was talking to him about the situation with Jon and the more I talked to him the more I realized that Ryan represents what I want.  Ryan held my hand as we talked.  I thought…well, I’m not real sure what I thought.  All the time I was talking to Ryan about my lack of happiness and the whole time I kept thinking: “And then there is you.”  What is going on with me?  I’ve never wanted Ryan like this.  I need to figure out what to do about Jon.  I need to figure out what I want.  We’ll see how our talk goes tonight.

      Two postal workers in Washington DC are dead from inhaled anthrax. This is getting a little crazy. The cutaneous form, which has made up the majority of the cases is treatable and no one has died of that. But now, if the spores are getting up into the air that is a big problem and a big scary thought. The problem with inhaled anthrax is that by the time you actually start to show symptoms it is often too late to save your life. It is so hard to believe that the we are actually having a bioterrorist attack. Two months ago no one would have thought this was even possible. Up until now it has always been this far off distant nation and such a think would never really happen in our country…or so we thought. But now the unthinkable is reality and I’m not real sure how to handle it.  As far as my smaller life is concerned, I got my surgeon appointment moved to a week from tomorrow. That is so much better than November 21. I think it is safe to say that I will be having surgery, it is just a question of when and how serious it will be. God has really helped me out and I need to keep praying for strength to make it through this injury. I also need to keep praying about the situation with Jon. I am at a loss about what to do. I’m almost to a point now that I don’t know if I even want to marry Jon. I’m trying to figure out what it is that is causing all of this. Maybe part of it is that it is my last year of college and I am starting to realize that I never had much fun. Part of me wonders what I missed out on. This is a recurring issue and it becomes frustrating because Jon never has considered us not being together as an option. I don’t think that it is a good thing. It is like he has been so obsessed with me that he can’t get spending forever with me out of his head. There has never been an option of us to be with someone else. He won’t let that be an option and that drives me crazy. Sometimes I wonder if he just thinks of me as this little prize of his and he can’t stand the idea of loosing that prize.

      When I went out of my house this morning to go to my MRI Jon was sitting in my driveway. He drove down in the middle of the night. It really didn't make me feel any better. It was nice of him but it was too late. But I had my MRI and then Jon and I drove back to Lansing so I could shower and start to get ready for the wedding.  The wedding went well. I made it down the aisle and Chad and Jen are now married. It is so weird to think of Chad as married. He has always been my brother. Our relationship has always been much more than that of typical cousins. It really meant a lot to me to be a part of his wedding. It makes me a little sad when I think back to all the memories with him to realize that it is over. He has always been one to watch out for me and I know that in my eyes he could do no wrong, even when he did. I am so happy for him and I hope that Jen will make him happy for the rest of his life. She better.  Chad's wedding has made me think of my own wedding. You always hear about people saying as soon as they saw their spouse they knew they were "the one." That leaves me confused. Do you know that if the first time you saw the person you were 13 years old? I've really been spending my time lately trying to figure that out. I have another question: is there only one? I love Jon, I know that. I want so badly to make him happy. I've told him I will marry him next June 15 and sometimes, most of the time, I am very excited about that. But then, I wonder if I'm in love with the Jon that I first fell in love with and not the Jon now. The Jon now is less nice, less caring, more selfish. I keep telling myself it is the distance. But I'm not so sure. What if I marry him and find out that the Jon now is really the true Jon and not just something I am perceiving? I'm not sure I could be happy with that. He claims he loves me so much, but why do I feel so lonely and starved for love? But then, there looming in the background is Ryan. Ryan: who reminds me so much of Jon, the Jon I first fell in love with. Ryan: with whom a sexual tension exists between us. He shows me he cares about me. I know he would drop Aarthie for me. I find myself being less able to keep my wits about me around him. The truth came out from him on Wednesday and for a moment I felt the same. I am torn between two guys. One I am set to be married to and one who reminds me of what I want from a man. That should be the same person, but it isn't. Jon is not being the best fiance right now. He is not fulfilling my needs. But there is Ryan, filling the void Jon leaves. There is Ryan, 9 minutes away as opposed to 9 hours. All I could think about last night as I drove back to Ann Arbor alone was: Ryan would never do this to me. Ryan thinks I am beautiful the way I am and because of who I am. Jon continually hints at me staying thin. Is Ryan the guy for me? Is Jon? Is there someone else entirely? There is one other huge thing that keeps me from turning to Ryan...Lisa.

      As soon as I got home, Jon and I had to make a run into town to buy Chad and Jen's wedding gift, we had to buy Jon a suit and I wanted a dress for the wedding rehearsal. After the rehearsal I drove back to Ann Arbor alone because I have my MRI tomorrow morning at 5:30. I was so upset because Jon did not come with me. Last night we just had the talk about him caring about me and not just thinking about himself and he goes and does this. It never once crossed his mind that maybe he should come with me since it involved me doing a lot of running around in the dark. So I called him very upset. I made him cry but he never pulls through and shows me support when I really need it or when it is the most important. He is so selfish and really only thinks of himself. It makes me wonder why I am marrying him.

      So I got my appointment for my MRI. It is Saturday at 5:30 am! This is going to make a very long and tiring weekend. I'm going to have to drive to Lansing for rehearsal for Chad's wedding then drive back to Ann Arbor, get up Saturday morning have the MRI, drive back to Lansing to get ready for the wedding. When, I saw the surgeon he told me he wanted to see me as soon as possible after my MRI, so I call to set up my appointment and they tell me that as soon as possible is November 21st! I need to figure out something because this is getting ridiculous.  Jon came down because of Chad's wedding. We had a long talk about what has been going on with us. He really has not been the best as showing me he loves me. I told him about Ryan. I'm not sure why. I think part of it was a little bit of my attempt to make him realize that he cannot take me for granted because there are other wonderfully great guys out there that would love to be with me. They are closer than he thinks. Maybe even closer than I realize.

      I finally got to see the orthopedic surgeon today. One month after my injury. He thinks that I have torn cartiledge. So I'm supposed to have a MRI sometime next week here. So, I guess I pretty much assume that I'll be having surgery since that doesn't just fix itself. I guess the rest of the semester is going to play out to be a little on the long side. It was good know that he did not think it was alignment. I hope the MRI further validates that thought because of lot of the time cartiledge can be fixed arthroscopically. I am hoping that is the case for me. I'm so ready to be able to walk and bike again.  Today was Lisa's 21st birthday. I was of course put in the position to be the responsible sober one. So I was the only sober one really. Ryan had a bit too much to drink. Well, maybe not too much to drink but just enough to loosen his tongue and to tell me his feelings for me as being more than just a friend. I told him that it was just the alcohol talking. But he told me that all the alcohol was letting him say what was on his mind. He pretty much told me that he wished I wasn't with Jon because he would have gone after me. It was strange because I knew that there was a little something there, so I wasn't totally surprised. I am slightly attracted to Ryan as well and part of me wonders what would have happened if Jon and I had not been as serious when Ryan and I really started to get to know each other. Ryan reminds me a lot of Jon. I am sure that is where a lot of this comes from but there is always that wondering. I am torn by the question is it possible for there to be two people that are perfect for you? If so, how do I know which one is the best for me?

      The anthrax cases keep pouring in. Who would ever have thought that I would ever be writing about anthrax in the United States? It really is scary. I am just glad that it has not been the pulmonary anthrax because that is much more deadly at least than the skin infection that everyone is getting. "They" are sending it in letters to the news media. The senate majority leader also go one. The last I heard the 7 month old child of an ABC news personnel was infected. I'm not sure how that would respond to antibiotic treatment. Adults can be treated successfully with Ciprofloxacin. There is an e-mail going around right now not to go to the mall on Halloween. I'm not sure how valid a threat that is but you won't see me in a mall on Halloween. All this is seriously getting scary. Like I said before: nothing scares me more than biological warfare.

      Tonight was Jen's bachelorette party. We all met at her house and ate some dinner. After we were all done eating and Jen had opened her gifts we headed over to Grand Rapids. We were going to stay at a hotel and go to this bar called the Bob. Of course, I cannot walk real well so I really was not sure how great I was going to be. I was  VERY  happy that the hotel we were staying at was right across the street. I decided that I was not going to take my crutches because I thought they would just get in the way. Boy was that a mistake. I was really in a lot of pain by the end of the night. But one thing my limp did was give the boys a good excuse to come up and talk to me. I got a lot of offers for piggy-back rides and to be carried. This one guy was actually my age. He kept coming around me. I felt so bad because I had to break his heart. His name was Josh and he was cute. He was coming around asking me if I needed at piggy-back ride down the stairs. At the end of the evening he came over and asked me if I had a boyfriend. So, I had to tell me I was getting married. He was so disappointed! I felt so bad because he was nice and not scary in his approach to me. And like I said, he was cute! And ripped! It kind of made me wish I wasn't dating anyone. I would have given this guy my phone number. I would have kissed him. He asked me my name and he was like my sister's name is Heather, now I won't forget you. I was feeling terrible. I'm too nice I guess.

      As our military strikes continue against Afghanistan, the spokesman for al-Qaida, the organization headed up by bin Laden, said that the "storm of airplanes" will continue until we stop attacking Afghanistan. But, do they really expect us to believe that? They are not going to leave us alone. I really do not want fighting and war to be the answer but really, do we have any other choice? So, they are basically continuing their threat on our country. That is not something we are going to take lightly. I mean, we don't want to have to bomb stuff but we are without option at the moment. They are still investigating the two anthrax cases in Florida. I hope that further threats don't mean anything with biological agents. That is just too scary to think about so I think I'm going to stop talking about it.

      Our attack on Afghanistan continues . Part of the plan is to send in ground troops after all this has stopped. As of right now no one is sure if Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. I fear that it will take more than getting rid of just him to make this country feel safe again. There are a lot of crazy people out there and that is scary. How can you stop someone who doesn't care if they die? Those are the most dangerous people. Speaking of scary, there are two cases of anthrax in Florida. One man has died. The FBI has thought of this as an act of bioterrorism. I am much more scared of that then of bombs or even chemicals. That is much more frightening than anything else. I pray that no terrorist ends up with that ability.

      The front page of today's Daily screams: "US at War!" We are bombing Afghanistan. The major targets of this strike are Taliban headquarters. It is unfortunate that civilians have to die in this attack but there really is no other way. We are attempting to immoblize the Taliban so that we can go after bin Laden. Our targets are mostly airports and places intelligence suggest as Taliban camps. The president is making an interesting statement, while we are bombing we are also giving food to civilians. It is a statement that the US is attacking terrorism, not Islam. Bin Laden is trying to make this a holy war against Christians and Jews but he is wrong. We are not attacking Muslims! Islam is a peaceful religion. There was nothing peaceful about September 11! It is scary to think about what more could come of this but what else can we do? Students here are rallying to protest the war. What is wrong with them? Do they really think that if we just sit back and do nothing this will go away? If we could do this without war, without bombing we would! Why don't they understand that sometimes I think people just want something to protest. But sorry folks this isn't a perfect world.

      Well, today was my mom's birthday so it involved a family gathering. We were a little annoyed because Grandma insisted on having it in the evening even though we told her I had an exam and need to get back but she really didn't care. All I cared about was seeing Jacob. He is really special to me. I love that little boy more than anything. Very little else makes me more happy than just being with him and playing with him.  On a much heavier note, we began bombing Afghanistan today. From what I understand we are going after important Taliban sites and trying to open the airspace so we can fly without worry. I'm not really sure what else is planned but it is scary. No one know what is going to be happening.

      Why does the world place so much importance on looks? Why do Christians? Why do I?  I wish I knew why so much was placed on appearance. Especially for women. This leads to so many problems. I wish I knew. I am guilty of it. I never think of myself as attractive, I know that is wrong but I struggle to alter my mind set. I do little to alter my appearance though. While I don't feel like I am attractive, I am engaged so I don't feel like I have to be. Maybe society is so focused on it because how you look is the first thing people notice about you. It is part of your first impression and people claim that is so important. Who knows? Maybe that is the root. People want companionship and more often that not people will only approach other people that they find attractive. I guess all that is just part of the dynamics of being a human. It can be obnoxious though.

      1. Am I a justifier? Do I like to do questionable stuff and then say, "There's nothing wrong with that?" 2. What specific activities do I often justify? 3. Do I need to ask the "what good is it" question more often?  I think the for the most part everyone tries to justify what they do wrong. It is part of human nature. I know that it is something I do, but I try not to. For the most part, I'm not doing anything that is so awful and terrible that I need to be justifying myself for it. I know I sin but don't usually think about it before. I guess one big example was what happened this weekend with Jon. I knew it was wrong but I still did it. Now I'm not feeling so great about it and I DON'T want to do it again. So I've prayed and God has forgiven me for that.

      So today was back to school. It really is hard to get back into the swing of things after enjoying my weekend like I did. I am really missing Jon. Like I said before, I am taking that as a rather good sign. It is weird because I feel like Friday night never happened. It was definitely weird. Jon and I spent some time talking about it. Jon never really came out and said what he thought. I was honest and told him how I was feeling. I said that I didn't regret what happened but at the same time I didn't want it to happen again. I want to hold off until our wedding night. That is only 257 more days. I can wait, right? The weird thing is, Friday night I never actually thought about the slight risk that I might get pregnant. I'm on the pill and Jon did not orgasm but there is still that slight chance. But we will know in a week and a half. I really wish that there wasn't the time restraint on our talking because there was really a lot that I would have like to keep discussing.

      Here’s something that’s a little scary: I have no idea where I’m going to be in a year.  Throughout my whole life I’ve always known.  Now, I don’t have any idea.  How did I grow up so quickly?  What happened?  Sometimes I don’t even feel like I should be in college and in April I graduate.  I feel like I just graduated from high school.  Part of me wonders how on earth I could possibly think I am ready for graduate school.  But then there is this other part of me that can’t wait to get out there and start making a difference in this crazy, messed up world that we are living in right now.   I guess the CIA is hiring microbiologists right now.  I guess it is because of all the anthrax that is going on right now.  I am glad that has calmed down a bit.  I think we have pretty much incapacitated the Taliban, so I hope the worst of it is over.  Christmas worries me because it is such a big US holiday.  But there is no sense in getting all worried about things I have absolutely no control over.  Christmas is a great time.  I love the atmosphere and the joy.  I bought a few gifts today.  I love to buy gifts that I know people will love.  That is the best!  But I need to finish my scrapbook for my parents.

      Jon left to go back to school today.  I am missing him already.  When I went into the bathroom and his shaving kit wasn’t there it all sunk in.  There is just something reassuring about Jon’s shaving kit being in my bathroom.  It’s just nice to know that Jon is here with me.  Soon, he will be with me everyday.  That makes me happy.  I think that I am finally getting excited about marrying Jon again.  This weekend Jon and I picked out our wedding invitations and have been looking at our honeymoon options.  I’m so glad to finally be getting over this hurdle that we had encountered.  Well, I guess it is more of a hurdle I have encountered.  I hope that this is over.  I don’t want to have any more doubts or any more questions.  I’m getting so ready to be married to him.  Certain little thoughts make me really happy.  Things like getting to wake up every morning beside him, or sitting down to eat dinner together.  Something as simple as seeing his toothbrush there next to mine or seeing his razor or his deodorant sitting there.  It is all those little things that I will be looking forward to.  I know he will be easier to live with than Lisa.  At least Jon picks up after himself.  That is all that I can ask for.  When I stop and look back on it, Jon has everything that I want in a man.  With this thought in my mind I should be okay.

      Today was my last Michigan football game.  I must say it was really kind of sad.  It was even sadder that we lost.  I would have liked for us to win our final football game but that didn’t happen.  I walked into Michigan Stadium for the last time as an undergrad today.  It was sad day.  I hope some day to return to the stadium, full with its 110,000 people, most of them fully supporting the Maize and Blue.  There are few feelings that compare to it.  Michigan football is a great tradition and I’m so glad to have been apart of it for four years.  Go Blue!

      Thanksgiving is such a great holiday.  You get to go be with family, eat good food all day and watch football.  What a great holiday!  The interesting part of all of this is that Jon and I must juggle two dinners.  At noon we ate with his parents, sisters, grandparents and Uncle Bob.  This year also involved me being in all the family pictures.  I am now included in their family.  So, after the dinner with Jon’s family we drove into my Grandma Joyce’s for dinner with my entire family.  We spent most of the evening with my family.  I guess that is just kind of what happens when we go there last.  It is nice to be able to be with the family.  I don’t want to be the kind of people where we only see our families on Christmas and Thanksgiving.  I like the way my family is set.  I like that we see each other often.  I don’t want to loose that.

      Well, I saw the surgeon again today.  This time he was much more helpful.  He actually touched my knee and looked at my MRI.  My cartilage is torn and that means surgery.  I don’t get it because last time I was there he told me I needed to let it heal on its own but then this time he told me that torn cartilage doesn’t heal on its own.  I don’t get that, but whatever.  He said that they would be unable to tell what exactly they need to do until they get in there.  He said they would either repair it but it would take three months to recover or they would trim it and remove part of the cartilage, which would take 6 weeks to recover.  I think I would rather take the longer recovery period so I don’t have to deal with the problems later with having part of the cartilage removed.  So on January 8th, I’ll be having surgery.  After my appointment, Jon and I drove home.  We went and got stuff for our honeymoon.  Then we ate pizza at his house.  I spent the rest of the night hanging out and relaxing with my mom.  It was nice.

      I think our weekend went really well.  Saturday when I woke up Jon had made breakfast for me.  It was really nice.  Later on we watched Michigan’s football game.  Jon made me a chicken dinner with corn and the yummy potatoes we make.  Lisa had left and so Jon and I were able to just be together.  Sunday, I had to do some studying because I had an exam today.  After I did my bit of studying we watched  Sleepless in Seattle .  Today, I had to go to class and had physical therapy.  After I got home I found out that my retroviruses class tomorrow as cancelled because the professor is sick.  So, Jon and I were able to relax again tonight.  There was just something very comforting by know that when I was done for the day Jon would be there to pick me up.  That has been such a nice feeling.  It has really made me wish that Jon was going to be here all the time.  He would drive me to class and pick me up because I know how much he likes to help me.

      Jon came down last night.  It was so nice for him to be here.  I didn’t go into work this morning.  Instead, I spent the morning being in bed snuggled up next to Jon.  He was sweet enough to drive me up to class and then pick me up from physical therapy.  I go back to the surgeon Wednesday.  We’ll see what the verdict turns out to be.  Jon and I relaxed and watched the Red Wings game together.  We like to watch Wings games together.  We were both a little jealous because Lisa got to go to the game.  Her dad knew someone who has box seats at the Joe.  I am definitely feeling good about Jon being here.  I am feeling very content.  I’m beginning to get a little more excited about our relationship.  I must say I am feeling happy.  Happiness is not something I have been experiencing lately.  I am really looking forward to being happy once again.

      Jon is coming home on Thursday.  So I am busting my butt right now trying to get everything done that I need to.  This next week will be pure insanity.  Friday, I have an evolution exam; Monday, I have an infectious diseases exam and I have an assignment due on Tuesday for my retroviruses class.  I want to try and get as much of it done as possible since Jon will be here this weekend and my studying time will be limited.  I’m looking forward to spending the time with Jon.  We really need this break.  It may decide the fate of our relationship.  I am really wanting to just get this all figured out.  I want to soap opera that is my life to end and for things to return to normal.  I can hardly wait for my life to return to its normal chaos.  It will be a welcomed chaos.

      I decided to head home this weekend instead of staying in Ann Arbor since standing at the game would not prove to be the most beneficial to my knee.  I’m still having the knee problems.  I’m so sick of this thing.  I’m looking forward to walking again.  This weekend was nice.  Being at home always has its perks.  Yesterday, we all went out to dinner and saw  Hamlet  at MSU.  It was pretty good.  I like Shakespeare.  All this comes after this crazy guy in my Shakespeare class wrote me a sonnet.  That’s right, a sonnet.  It was this poem where he professed his love for me.  It freaked me out because I don’t know this guy at all!  All he knows about me is my major.  How can you be in love with someone if that is all you know about them?  I think this guy is taking Shakespeare a little too seriously.  But that is that.   Today, I went with the family to see   urlLink Monsters, Inc  .  That was such a cute movie.  Our whole family really liked it.  I was really glad I got to be at home this weekend.

      So tonight Jon and I started our new trend of talking on the phone.  After this weekend we both decided that it would probably be best to just suck up the increase of phone bill cost and talk on the phone at night.  We are truly having some communication problems and the computer does not seem to help that at all.  In fact in tends to make things worse.  We hide stuff when we talk on the computer and it really leads to a whole new world of problems after that.  This weekend has left me feeling better.  I’m not to 100% just yet but I am getting there.  I thought that a real good sign was that I didn’t think about Ryan all weekend.  In fact, until I mentioned him just now, I haven’t thought about him at all.  I know it will still take some time but I think that I am going to figure out that I still want to marry Jon.  I do love him.

      I think for the most part my weekend with Jon was good.  We were able to talk about things and I think for the most part we are on the same page with each other.  When all is said and done I still love Jon and I still want to marry him.  It is so hard for me to feel doubtful when he says he is so excited to get married.  I’m not always excited to be getting married and I need to get back to that point.  I’m not bummed about getting married.  I’m indifferent.  That could be a problem.  I think that I should be so excited I can hardly contain myself.  But right now I’m not.  I used to be.  Chances are my lack of excitement is correlated to my confusion with things.  I am hoping that when I am sure again the excitement will return.  I think that may be my sign that I am sure.  But what if it doesn’t come?  Perhaps my happiness with Jon this weekend was an indication that Jon is right for me and with just a little more time the excitement will return.  This is what I want to happen.  I don’t want to break Jon’s heart and I don’t want to have to face my family and friends if I do.  If I do call this off with Jon, you better believe I will be taking off out of state for graduate school.

      Jon came down today.  It was strange because for the first time in a long time, I felt genuinely happy.  I was happy to be with him but I’m still a little confused.  I’m not sure if this means that the distance is what is making me unhappy or if it extends beyond that further.  It is really hard to say.  I am hoping that Thanksgiving will provide me with a much better insight into such a thing.  Jon will be down here for a week at that time and I think that should be helpful.  I am definitely not in a position to make any kind of a decision.  It meant a lot to me that he came down.  That says something to me.  But at the same time he is really focusing on trying to make me happy so maybe I won’t know until he forgets and starts thinking about himself again.  I hope he doesn’t do that, if he doesn’t do that then things will be a lot better and I will be a happy girl.

      So, I tried to take my aunt's advice by not thinking about the situation with Jon but this didn't turn out exactly as I had hoped.  When he is calling me it makes things rather difficult to put things out of my mind.  But I did my best.  Jon is coming down tomorrow.  Well, he will be here in the morning.  I kind of bothers me that he didn't leave this afternoon.  The reason...he has a hockey game.  That bothers me.  I know it shouldn't because he is coming when he wasn't planning on it but still...a hockey game?  Maybe I'm just being too selfish but isn't this part of the problem?  Jon keeps asking me what I think is going to happen this weekend.  I don't know why he thinks I have all the answers.  I don't have them.  I am so lost right now that I don't know what to do!  I feel like I'm blind in the dark.  I need something to either open my eyes or turn o the light.  I'm hoping that this weekend will do something.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see...

      I got a letter today from Michigan inviting me for an interview! I am so excited because Michigan is my top choice. The end of the letter said that I had excellent credentials and that they were very interested in me as potential student. I am so incredibly excited. I would love to go to Michigan. I hope that the letter is as promising as it sounds. Jia told me that if you get invited to interview you are pretty much accepted because they pay for your flight, meals and everything. Of course, Michigan doesn't have to pay for me to fly anywhere. I am feeling a lot better about myself now. I now feel like I am worthwhile and capable of being what I have always dreamed of.

      Today is Ellie's first birthday. I can hardly believe that little doll is a year old already. It doesn't seem like that long ago that she was born. To celebrate, Julie had a party at her house. It was my first big family appearance since my wonderful news. Of course my family was very happy for me. Chad was thrilled because he is a big Ohio State fan. Michigan is still my top choice but I'm still completely thrilled to know that I'm going to get to go somewhere. Everyone had complete faith in me and they keep saying how many more letters I am going to get. I don't know about that but I'm pleased with getting just one.

      I AM SO EXCITED!!! I got an acceptance letter in the mail today from Ohio State. I got into their microbiology PhD program! I am so excited because this means I get to go to graduate school! I was so worried that my GPA was going to keep me from getting in. BUT I GOT IN!!! I'M GOING TO GET MY PHD!!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!! This may be going down as one of the best days of my life! I still haven't heard from Washington, Michigan, Illinois or Penn or UMass. I don't really want to go to Illinois so we'll just throw that one out right now. I'm not making any decisions yet but I'm just pleased because I get to go somewhere. I'm going to get to reach my dream! I'm finally going to get to see all my hard work at Pfizer pay off. I knew it had to! I'm going to achieve my dream!!

      From now until February 5th on Tuesdays and Thursdays I will have my microbial pathogenesis class. The professor is Phil H, his lab is one of my top choices if I was to get into Michigan for graduate school. I like him, he is funny and not a complete science nerd. The class doesn't seem to be that bad. There are two exams and they involve us reading a paper and writing an abstract. I don't think that will be bad at all. It is fair and something we are all going to need to know how to do. I'm so intensely interested in my major that I love reading papers and learning all about the research that is going on and the complexity of the microbes we are constantly battling against.  After class and work I drove home to pick up my bridesmaid dresses and for my Aunt Carole's birthday. My grandma made chop suey for dinner and we all ate there. It was so yummy. Of course this meant we got to see Jacob and Ellie. Ellie is really becoming a pistol, she is getting into everything and is just running around like crazy. She has the most precious face though. Those cheeks are to die for. And of course Jacob, my little buddy. I don't know what it is but there is definitely a connection between Jacob and I. I love that little boy to death. I asked him if he wanted to be in my wedding and he told me that he needed to be married first. Sometimes I wonder where a three year old comes up with the things Jacob comes up with. He was touching everyone on the knee and I asked him not to hit my knee because I had "owies" on it and he wanted to see them so I showed him my incisions. He got scared and ran over to Julie and asked if they were going to cut his knee. He is so precious and truly makes me want to have children.

      This marks my first full week of classes. Since last week really wasn't much of a school oriented week I will go over classes this week. I only have 5 credits this semester; which I am very excited about by the way. So, on Monday and Wednesday I have Dante's  Divine Comedy . Amanda and I are in this class and we are both taking it pass/fail so that should be great. This is the first time we have ever taken a class together. The professor is really hard to hear so we are going to have to sit up near the front because she speaks so quietly and it makes things very hard to pay attention. I think it will be interesting especially since the  Divine Comedy  is such an important work. I also went back to work today. It will be nice to get back into the inflow of funds. I can't want for that. Right now I'm really pinched for money but that will all work out. That is just what I keep telling myself. I will be able to work 40 hours a week this semester, so I should be able to bring in some money. April 27th is the day all my hard work pays off. April 27th I graduate!

      I think the day of my surgery went a lot better than the day after. I had a very bad reaction to the Vicitin and I was not doing well. I had to go back to the doctor for my post-op appointment. Well, the pain medicine had me really screwed up and I was nauseous and dizzy and my face was ashen. It was bad. Jon and to carry me to the car because I couldn't stand up. I got to the doctor and he showed me the pictures of my knee and I guess the huge band of scar tissue I had lodged in my knee had rubbed divets in the end of my femur. I'm not real sure what that means but that was the pain source. So to prevent it from happening again (since this is the second time) I am going to go to intense physical therapy, 3 times a week for a month. I was supposed to start today but since I was so messed up from the drugs they didn't make me. I ended up going home and just trying to sleep off the pain medicine. The real tricky part was trying to read my papers for my class, this is college and you can't just miss class.

      I had my knee surgery today. It went well. I guess my cartilage wasn't torn after all. I had scar tissue in my knee again that was creating problems. It was on the end of my femur and they think that was what was causing all my pain. My parents drove down and Jon was here so it was like a big surgery party. I'm feeling really sore right now but they gave me Vicatin as my pain killer. I've been taking it but it makes me nervous because the last time I had that it really messed me up. They said to just take one so hopefully that will be okay. But it was good news that there was nothing structurally wrong with my knee. How great is that?

      Amy and I met and had dinner tonight. I go the news not long ago that she is pregnant. I am so excited for her. She will be 7 months along for my wedding but we talked to Lett's and it is all worked out. They are going to order extra fabric for her and make her dress fit. She said this they told her this happens all the time and that they do this a lot. I am so excited for her! She is due August 21st and I promised I would come back from wherever I am to see her and her new baby. She told me that her and Chris are going to find out the sex of the baby. They've already picked out the names: Jacob Christian if its a boy and Emily Christine if its a girl. Amy's parents are so excited and so are Chris's parents. Finally, one of my friends is having a baby the right way! Amy was really happy because Chris had gone out and bought a little outfit. It was for a boy but at least he was getting excited about it.  It makes me excited for when Jon and I have a child. I cannot imagine the feeling of having a child that is from both of you. It is a moment that I am really looking forward to.

      Jon and I spent this New Year's at Chad and Jen's house. It was fun to hang out with Chad. I haven't been able to do that in a long time. We went over there at 9:00 and didn't leave until almost 5 in the morning! It's not like we were even partying. We just played cards, drank a funky daquiri drink and hung out and talked. Amy and Chris were going to come over but Amy was sick so they didn't. It was fun but this New Year's was a lot less eventful than last New Year's when Jon proposed. But now we are about 5 and a half months from our wedding and that alone is exciting. New Year's Day is always about watching football. We went into Aunt Carole's because Julie was there with Jacob and Ellie. Ellie is really getting around and getting herself into trouble. Jacob was sick and not feeling well. He really wasn't himself. I felt bad for the poor little guy. He is really a sweetie. I love that little guy. Jacob and Ellie really re-emphasize that I want to have children.

      I got Jon's Valentine's Day card today. It was a week late but it came. I read his card and started to cry. The card was really sweet and it really made me miss Jon. It was when I read his card that I realized I had fallen in love with Jon all over again. I don't know when I fell in love with him again but I realized it today. It was that moment when I read his card that I realized how badly I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. I'm so glad I got that card. I'm not sure I would have come to that realization without it. Maybe I would have but it would have taken me longer and maybe would have tormented me longer with this sense of unknowing and unsureness that had overcome me recently. Whatever it was the card has made me realize how much I love Jon and why I love him and how badly I want to be with him forever.

      I do not like Valentine's Day. I think this is my least favorite day of the year. I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it's because I never get to be with the man I love on the day that is supposed to celebrate love. On the radio all day they kept playing love songs. It was quite annoying to be quite honest. Jon says he sent me a card. I didn't get it so I'm not real sure how true that is but we'll see.  Since neither one of us get to be with our men, Amanda and I went out together. We went and saw   urlLink A Beautiful Mind  . That was such a good movie. I think that Russell Crowe really deserves to win an Oscar for that role. He did such an incredible job that there were times you forgot that he was the actor. It was such a captivating movie. It has been a long time since I have felt that moved and enamored by a movie.

      Well, it seems that I will be racking up some frequent flier miles. I got an e-mail from UMass inviting me out for their recruitment weekend. My spring break is going to be filled with travel. On Tuesday (26th), I fly out to Columbus, on Thursday I fly back into Detroit, hang out in the airport and then catch a flight out to Providence, Rhode Island to visit UMass Worcester. I come back from UMass on Sunday. The only negative thing is that Jon will be home on Thursday. But he will be there to pick me up on Sunday, then I will have an entire week with him. I can't believe how cool it is that they just fly us out there, put us up and feed us. I guess I should have applied to more places to get more free trips.

      Well, Winter Carnival is over. Jon really had a hard time with me leaving this time. I'm not sure what it was but he cried. Jon never cries when I leave but he did this time. It was so nice to get up there on Wednesday. We got there around 6 pm Wednesday evening. Jon and I walked around campus and watched the sculptures being finished. It was really cool to see how they finished them. We didn't stay out real late because I slipped and tweaked my knee a bit. Thursday we went into campus and looked at all the statues. The rest of the day and Friday we just hung out and were together. But on Saturday, Jon's parents came up so we walked around campus with them. That night they took us to dinner at this really good seafood place.  Amanda's and my drive home was good until about Mt. Pleasant at which time everyone decided they needed to drive 35 mph. Amanda and I stopped at my parents house to get my car. It is always good to finish the drive and be home.

      I got an e-mail today from Ohio State inviting me to come visit. They are going to fly me down to Columbus and put me up in a hotel so that I can see campus and see the facilities. It kind of makes me laugh because I am flying from Detroit to Columbus, Ohio. But, hey, I'm not complaining because they are paying for my flight. Every thing in my life is so exciting right now.  Wednesday, Amanda and I are driving up to Tech for Winter Carnival. I'm not sure I'm really looking forward to the trip. I don't know what it is but I'm going through some very confusing stuff. I have to say I think it will be a lot nicer having more time though. I am slightly worried about how my knee is going to hold up with all this walking around on snow and ice. I'm sure I'll be okay though.

      There are two sacraments in the church...baptism and communion. Our lives are to be extensions of Jesus. -Relate to the Lord's spirit upon me and unaccepted in my hometown. I want to  SERVE GOD!  -How am I being called to be a servant-leader? I want to be a vessel to bring God's Word to others. I want to study and to teach.

      I'm starting to go through this book from Pastor Sandy about my reflections with becoming a minister. 1. How have I experienced the church as a faith community? -As a child - pre-school, open to the community -In HS - Kid's Cupboard, food drives -Now - Angel's Attic, chicken dinners, open doors 2. How have I experienced the church as a response to what God has done for mankind and creation? -Support network for members -Beacon of light -Source of great love

      I can't sleep so I might as well do some reading.   Chapter 5 - The New Moses  Matthew presents Jesus as the new Moses - This was probably because the Hebrews greatly regarded Moses and his gospel was written to a  Jewish  audience. Christ's exodus was one away from sin.   Chapter 6 - The New Elijah  Portrayal of John the Baptist as Elijah but Jesus was an even greater Elijah. He brought life not death.  This book has been so awesome to go through. I really like the author and his insights.

       Chapter 3: The Transition into Religion  -It is critical to think of Jesus in a Jewish mind set because He  was  Jewish. For Hebrews the good person was the  whole  person -Christ was a specific figure in history - this reaffirms our belief in Him as Savior -One view was to give up the "desires of the flesh." Stating that marriage was a sin. This seems to go against what God stated in creation, where man and woman are to be united as one flesh and to be fruitful and multiply -We bless food before we eat it. Why?  God  has already blessed it. We should really be blessing God.   Chapter 4: Sin - A Description of Our Being  -Good is not defined by deeds. There is more to being a Christian than simply doing good deeds and not doing bad ones.

      One of the books Pastor Sandy lent me is  This Hebrew Lord.  By John Shelby Spong. I'm going to use this for notes as I read through it.   Chapter 1: A Necessary Personal Word  -Christ not in with today's society? -I'm not sure I agree with that -But what does Christ mean to me? -See Jesus in a Hebrew light! -I think that it is important to remember that Jesus was a Jew. I'm not sure I fully understand all of the Jewish aspects of Jesus's teaching but it is something I hope to someday understand   Chapter 2: Learning to Think Biblically  -Religion and Religious -I think in today's society there words do have a negative air about them. They seem to be associated with a "holier than thou" attitude. I too cringe at being called religious -"The goal of Christian mission - not to become religious but to set one free, call to life, invite to love." -Spiritual and Spirit -For me spiritual means being in tune with God and one's spirit. -Hebrew words: - Nephesh  - breath, breath of God - Rauch  - wind, wind of God -These are more along the lines of how I think of spiritual. -"To be indwelt by the spirit, the breath of God, was not to be pious but to be alive, to be vital!: -"To be spiritual means to be alive." -Faith - to be bold, courageous. Step out into the unknowns of life! -Salvation - Salvation is about power! The fullness of living.

      Amanda is getting married in an hour and a half!!!  I am so very excited for her. Amanda is such a wonderful friend. There are few better. That is what makes this day all the more wonderful. I miss Amanda so much. I wish we could still see each other everyday. I've known her almost 6 years. Only 6 years and she is one of my best friends.

      Rehearsal was really nice. We had dinner at Amanda's parents house. Their house is  AMAZING!  It was easily 5200 square feet. Probably the only million dollar home I'll ever be in. It was very cool. At dinner we said something about Amanda and Steve and then they said something about all of us. It was really nice.

      I just got home from meeting with Pastor Sandy. It was a really good talk that we had. We started by just chatting about general stuff but she asked me about lab. I said that I was still on leave but that was what I wanted to talk to her about. She stood up and went to her bookshelf and said, "Let me give you some books." So she gave me two books to get started with and we talked some more. I will probably become the lay delegate of our church. I would also go to lay speaker school this fall. We are also going to go through a book to help get me spiritually prepared. I have to say that probably for the first time in a year that I have felt truly happy.

      First, praise be to God! They were able to take care of things with my mom with the scope. It turns out she had these fatty adhesions that had adhered her colon to her abdominal wall. The freed those adhesions and that should make her feel a lot better.  I just had a great talk with my mom about our spiritual walks and my thoughts on seminary. I told her about the way I am leaning not toward ministry but study and perhaps linking my science and spirituality. She actually surprised me with her answer. She said, "I see how all along, the whole time you have always been concerned with ethics and balancing your faith with science." She then let me read her testimonial that she read to the church upon her confirmation. Wow, it make me appreciate her struggles with trying to have children and see how angry she was with God. And then when she accepted that I was born and they were able to adopt me. She told me that she truly believed that God took Grandma Belle from them to send them me. She died two months before I was born. What an overwhelming feeling to know that you were, no, are a direct answer to a prayer. That is a heavy thing.

      I am so sick of hospitals. Yet here I sit in yet another hospital waiting room. My mom is having a laproscopy today. I hadn't planned on coming up here and being at the hospital but my mom wanted me to be here. That actually surprised me. She of all people was the last person I ever expected to ask me to come. So, of course I don't say no. Sleep deprived and everything. My insomnia problems continue. I've only slept 14 hours the last three days. We'll see.

      My grandma is now in the hospital. She has got some kind of respiratory thing going on but nobody really seems to know the details. I went and saw her today. I was coming up to have dinner with some friends from high school and drove over to the hospital to visit. She seems to be doing better but the doctors don't know what is going on. Can I just say one thing? I am SO sick of hospitals! I swear I have spent more time in them in that last few months (last two years really) than any normal person should have to! The silver lining being that I haven't been a patient.  Well, like I said, I came up to have dinner with some of my friends from high school. One of my friends who I don't think I've seen in 3 years was back in town from Vegas so a bunch of us got together. It is always interesting when I get together with them. They all still live around my hometown and I feel like they still have their little clique that always does stuff together. Then there is me. It is always good to see Amy and it was nice to see that Sunshine is still clean and doing well.

      I met with the pastor of my mom's church today. My mom really wanted me to meet with him to talk about my thoughts of going into ministry. I had no problem with that because the more people I can discuss this path with the better. I think my mom had a hidden agenda though. I think she was hoping that he would talk me out of it or something, since she and my dad aren't the most keen on the idea. However, he did no such thing.  We had a great talk. I told him about my spiritual history and how I've come to this point in my faith journey and he listened. After he had finished listening he told me his insights. He definitely things that God is calling me into full-time service for Him. Based on what I told him, he told me that I had the qualities in me to become a great leader. I have the desire for human well-being on a global level and that is the one thing great leaders have in common with each other. He also paid me the highest complement anyone has ever paid me. He told me that I have the heart of Christ. I didn't even know how to respond to such a complement. I still don't and I'm not sure I ever will.

      We packed up from Lake Vernon this morning and set off to our next destination, Laurel Lake. This was without a doubt our easiest hiking day of the trip. We only went 4.7 miles and it was pretty flat. But after the all up of Day 2, I don't want to go up ever again. We ran into some trail crew on our way over. We were a little less than a mile from Laurel Lake and had to cross this river. Well, Jon jumped ever so gracefully from rock to rock and made it across the river without a problem. So I tried. I did not do so well. I landed on the first rock and when I jumped to the second rock I missed and landed in the river. I thought, well, my boots are already wet so I just splashed the rest of the way through the river. It was a good thing we didn't have that much further to go and that we are planning on spending tomorrow there too.  We got to camp around noon. It was really nice area. The lake was really nice and there were good clearings to put up our tent. There was even this nice big rock where we ate lunch. Jon and I walked down to the lake and waded in the water a little bit. Then for whatever reason I decided to stop on this log. Well, the log shifted and I fell in the water. I landed on the log. So of course Jon had to run up and grab the camera.     So I had to change my clothes. Jon and I settled in and we started reading our books. Jon ended up going into the tent to read but I stayed out and read in a lot of various places. I had found this comfortable spot leaning against a rock and looking out over the lake. All was quiet around camp and I noticed that the sky was clouding up for the daily 4 pm rain. So I stood up and turned to get back in the tent and there was a bear about 30 feet from me. I just kind of watched him for a while but then he looked at me so I waved my arms and yelled a couple times. Then, Jon yelled at me from the tent and I told him there was a bear. So he got out of the tent. We watched him but he really didn't seem to interested in us and just continued on his way. It was really cool. We got some pictures of him.    Mr. Bear

      We spent the day today at Lake Vernon. After our big hike yesterday it was really nice to have a day off. I'm a little sore today. The surroundings are so beautiful. It is so relaxing and peaceful. While yesterday really sucked, the trip has been excellent. I was feeling a little sick today. I'm not sure if it was from all the hiking yesterday or the altitude or a combination of things. I laid in the tent for a while and then found this very comfy rock. I know that sounds weird but smooth bedrock can make for a very pleasant place to lay. Around 1 I decided that I would try and go swimming in the lovely mountain stream that we were camped by. It was very, very cold. Jon took a picture.   urlLink    So Cold!  Posted by Hell0     After I got out, I was going to lay on the bedrock in the sun and dry off. But almost immediately after I got out the sky clouded up and was getting ready for the daily rain. The storm that rolled through had a lot of lightning so it was slightly scary being in a tent while there was lightning all around you. We survived though and are off to Laurel Lake tomorrow and our easiest hike of the trip, 4.7 miles.

      Ugh! Today was awful! At least I can rest easier knowing that today was the worst day. I am so sick of going up. If I never go up again it will be too soon. We ended up sleeping a little later than we had planned at didn't set out until about 10 am. We climbed for about two hours. We knew we were coming to this valley and had thought that we would stop and have lunch there. Well we got there and it was more of a marsh than a valley. There were mosquitoes everywhere! It was not a good place to stop. So we pressed on and crossed the valley. We ended up eating by this little stream and finished lunch about the time the clouds rolled in. When we set out again we saw what we were going to have to climb.  Shortly after the clouds rolled in the thunder started. Shortly after the thunder started the rain started. Shortly after the rain started the hail started. That's right, I said hail. The date is correct, we were being hailed on. The hail then turned into chunks of snow. Before long the trail was covered.  So we continue on being hailed on and it really hurt when they hit you on the head. We hiked and we hiked and we climbed and we climbed. Finally, we came to a level area where we had planned on camping. But it turned out that we were only about a mile from Lake Vernon where we planned to camp tomorrow so we figured what's one more mile? We finally came to the top of the mountain and began our decent down to Lake Vernon.  We rolled into our campsite about 7 and we aren't eating, we are just putting up the tent and going to bed. I'm exhausted.

       urlLink    Here I am setting out on the first day of our trip.  Posted by  urlLink Hello    We are at our campsite for the night. We ended up walking about two miles further than we had planned. So it ended up being 6 miles instead of 4 like we had planned. We were definitely able to see some very beautiful sights. It was a harder hike that I had anticipated but here we are at Rancheria Falls. The falls are beautiful and there is a little campground here. I have ended up with two blisters on my feet. Jon also has a couple on his feet. So taking care of those was one of our top priorities. Oh, yeah, we ran into a thunderstorm on the way up. Nothing serious, just a few rumbles of thunder and some moderate rainfall. Right now I am completely exhausted, so, I think I'm going to go to bed.

       urlLink    Jon and I with the bride and groom.  Posted by  urlLink Hello      What a lovely wedding. It was outside and outside in Sonoma is quite pleasant. There is no way I would have an outdoor wedding in Michigan, too much unpredictability in the weather. But it was really nice. The ceremony was nice. They had their parents hold the rings for them so that was nice. Since they both work at wineries there was certainly no absence of good wine at the reception portion. They had lots and lots of food. There were food stations set up. Tables with breads, cheeses, a ice carved bowl full of shrimp, a sushi station and a station with beef tenderloin and potatoes. I tried sushi for the first time. I was surprised it wasn't too bad. Its not something that I would eat everyday but I would eat it again. I also had some great wine too. It was really nice chatting with Jon's family and seeing a lot of them.  After the wedding we had to start driving toward Yosemite. We need to hike at least 4 miles tomorrow before we can camp so we figured we should head in that direction tonight so we get to the park with enough time to hike those miles before it starts to get dark.

      Since we had some time today before the wedding, Jon and I and his parents and sisters and his aunt and uncles and cousin drove over to the coast. We were at this really neat place called Goat Rock Beach. The coastline was so awesome. I think that I prefer coasts that have rocks and stuff on them over just plain sandy ones. At the beach the Russian River came in and met the ocean and where the two met there were all these seals laying on the beach with their bellies up. It was cool to see them. It was really cold and really windy though. We had lunch there and we huddled behind these rocks to eat. But there were these kids who kept tossing and sand and since it was so windy the wind caught the sand and blew it at us. I think we ended up eating a great deal of sand. The drive to and from the coast was really pretty too. We able to get some great pictures and some great views.   urlLink    On the coast  Posted by  urlLink Hello

      It was so nice. David and Carrie, Jon's cousin and fiance, took those of us who were interested on a tour of the winery Carrie works at. I figured we were in the Napa Valley we had to do a winery tour and taste wine. I thought the who thing was very neat. It was really interesting to learn how they make the wine and how they age it and all that kind of stuff. At the end of the tour we got to taste some. The only draw back was that the wine was right out of the barrels so it hadn't properly aged. I thought it was interesting to taste the difference between the same batch of wine that was in old oak barrels vs the one in new oak barrels. You could really taste the oak in the new oak barrels but couldn't from the old ones. Jon tasted some wine too but he didn't think it was as enjoyable as I did.   urlLink    Jon tasting wine  Posted by  urlLink Hello

      So, I've been on a bit of a hiatus here. And a lot has really happened on my little break. I've been thrust into a few more hospital settings. Grandpa is still on dialysis but really not doing the best. He has lost a great deal of weight as well as loosing muscle mass. So things are really not the best with him. Also my Aunt Bev is in the hospital and doing quite poorly. She is in ICU. Unfortunately, I don't know too much of the details and haven't been able to see her since I've been sick.  On a different more positive note: I'm finally happy. It is such a wonderful feeling to be happy again. I finally have reached a level of peace within myself. I have realized fully that God is calling me into full-time service for him. On Friday, I told Vic that I am leaving the program. I have to say it felt like a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Jon is really getting on me about getting a job. But I really don't know if I want a lab job. But that is where my experience is. I am very much looking forward to my career that will be focused totally on God.

      It was so nice. My mom had this gift certificate for a massage and since massages have hurt her in the past she gave it to me. So I went with my aunt and uncle to have a massage. It was so nice. I enjoy massages and professional ones are so great. It was so relaxing and nice. I've been so tense lately with the money situation and job hunting that this massage was just what I needed. I felt so relaxed that leading Bible study was very difficult. It really wasn't the best one I've led but I think we still got something out of it. Jon's mom came for the first time. I figured we had to add one more because we just weren't getting enough for good discussion. Also seeing that she is Catholic it would be nice to have a Catholic perspective. She did provide some interesting insight.

      We had a scary night last night. I was up because I can't sleep. We had left the cars outside because Jon and I had borrowed his parents truck to take some stuff down to our house. I had unloaded it earlier in the day and the stuff was in the garage so Jon and I had parked our cars outside. It was about 1:45 in the morning and I had gone back to the bathroom. All of a sudden I heard this crash and I hurried back out and the motion light on the front of our house had turned on and I saw this car whip out of our driveway. So I woke up Jon and we were out in our driveway at like 3 in the morning in the rain checking things out. It turns out that someone had picked up this 30 pound bucket of mortar that Jon had put out by the curb for the trash and carried it up between our two cars. I think they were going to use it to break in the window but when the motion light kicked on they dropped the bucket and ran and that was the crash that I heard. It turns out that Jon had been out in the garage and left the garage door open. So it was a good thing that I was still up or else who knows. So needless to say Jon and I did not sleep real well last night. Now we are being extremely careful and jumpy. Afterwards, Jon went downstairs and got his shotgun and so that is by the bed now.

      I had a job interview today with a temp agency. The job is with the Red Cross. I'm sure it would be screening blood. I would be working midnights but that doesn't bother me considering I can't sleep at night anyway. I thought the interview went well. They seemed impressed with my experience and thought that I would fit well with the Red Cross position. They told me that they would let me know by the beginning of August and that they would let me know either way. So hopefully, the Red Cross will like me and I will have a job here before too long. In order to treat myself after the interview I stopped and got a bagel sandwich. Now I have to go and finish up my preparations for Bible Study tonight.

      Well, Aunt Carole and I finally got my mom to scrapbook with us. I thought that my scrapbook party I had in June would do the trick. It did. So we got together at my aunt's and we got mom going on the scrapbooking. I didn't end up working on my book much because I was helping my aunt work on the scrapbook we are doing for Grandma of Grandma Nina. It was her Christmas present last year and we still haven't finished it...Oops! But it was fun and nice. Scrapbooking has always been mine and Aunt Carole's thing and now I've got my mom into it so it's great.

      Well, the good news with job possiblities just keep flowing in.  I got a call this afternoon from a staffing company who is staffing labs for the Red Cross.  The position would be third shift but I don't care.  She set up an interview with me for next Wednesday at 11.  I'm not sure what the pay would be but I feel like the Red Cross is a noble cause and wouldn't mind working for them at all.

      Well, there is no turning back now. I went into my old lab today and talked with our student representative and handed in my ID and made sure everything was square there. Then I finished getting the rest of my stuff from lab. So I am no longer a graduate student. While I was in there I was talking with Kristie and Laura (who both joined the lab) and Kristie was telling me about her fiance who was quitting his tech job to go to grad school. She gave me the name of his PI and so when I got home here I e-mailed her about his position. So maybe that will provide me with something. I don't really want a job right now but I need one because money is starting to get tight and it is making Jon antsy.

      I just got a call from my breeder. She was very upset. She told me that one of the puppies in Riley's litter died suddenly. He had shown any signs of illness but just suddenly died. They did an autopsy but it was inconclusive. It did however show some kind of abnormality with his heart. So, just to be on the safe side she wants to have the puppies in the litter to have a heart screen done. So she is going to take them up to MSU. She was in tears on the phone. After I got off the phone with her I started crying myself. I don't know what I would do if something happened to Riley. I was be so distraught. I'm really worried about him.

      Aunt Bev's funeral was this afternoon.  It seems very unreal to me.  My poor uncle is just beside himself and doesn't know what to do.  Who can blame him though?  They had been married for 51 years.  I can't imagine what that must feel like.  The funeral was very nice.  I was really surprised to see that Jon was crying.  I had no idea.  I mean I knew that Aunt Bev was his favorite one of my relatives but I didn't think he would cry.  It was kind of sweet to see.  After the funeral there was a dinner at my mom's church.  It was nice.  I was surprised to see so many people there.  At the dinner there were so many people that Jon and I went and ate lunch outside.  I had planned on going back home tonight but was so tired that I just ended up staying at my parents.  My mom and I went down to Uncle Glenn's to visit with him.  It is just so sad to see him so upset and broken.  That is always the hardest part of death.  Seeing the way other people respond to it.

      I got up to the funeral home at about 1:00. It seems that I beat everyone to the funeral home. But shortly after I arrived my uncle came and then my Aunt Carole was not far behind him. I always find it odd when you talk about how a deceased person looks. But she looked good. A lot better than she did when I saw her Sunday. I think it always makes the people grieving feel better to see their loved one looking somewhat the way they always remember them. It makes you feel that they are truly at peace. Its really hard to think someone is at peace when they still look distressed.  I ended up going down to my Aunt Carole's to finish up the picture boards of my aunt's life. That was nice to look back over the years of when she was happy and having a good time. After the first round of visitation we went down to my grandma's and had some of the food that everyone brought for our family. Jon came down for the evening visitation. I seriously think three quarters of the town was there. It was really nice to see how many people my aunt had influenced in her life. I'm staying the night at my grandparents since my parents are re-doing my old bedroom and there is no bed. Its always interesting to stay with Grandma and Grandpa.

      Well, Jon and I went up to my parents as we had planned. We had just pulled into the driveway when my mom came out and told me that my Uncle Glenn had just called and my Aunt Bev had flat-lined and he wanted us to come to he hospital right away. So, I got out of the car and got into the car with my mom. Jon took Riley over to his parents'. Riley wasn't real sure he wanted to let me out of his sight. I think the thought I was going to leave him again. So Mom and I went over to the hospital but by the time we got there my aunt had passed away. My uncle was a mess and was blaming himself. It turned out that she had a heart attack while she was eating. It was the heart attack that killed her. Her heart was just too week to go on. She had already had several heart attacks over the last couple of weeks. You know what the sad and depressing part is, I thought that I'd be grieving over my grandpa before I was grieving over another family member. This really wasn't what I expected to happen on our first day back.

      We just got home from our trip. Our flight home was a little rough and because we were flying over bad weather. It made me really thankful they showed a movie. Some lady on the flight had some sort of medical problem so when we landed we had to wait for paramedics to come on the plane. I'm not sure what was wrong with her, I'm thinking maybe it was motion sickness since the flight was so rough. But we are home now. I'm ready to go pick up Riley. But I didn't think Sue and Chuck would appreciate me coming to get him in the middle of the night. But I will be getting him tomorrow. I'm excited to see my puppy.

      Jon and I hiked out of Yosemite. I had a difficult time sleeping last night and at 6:00 this morning was wide awake. Jon woke up right about then too and we decided that since we were up we might as well get hiking. So we ended up leaving camp around 6:45. We made really good time on our way out. Of course we were going down the whole way so that made things a lot easier. It wasn't even all that steep of a down. We ended up hiking about 9 miles out. The only problem I had on the way down was that my ankles kept giving out on me so I kept rolling my ankles and I fell a couple of times too. Once we got out we had to hike about another mile back to the car. Here's a picture on the dam at the end of the trip. We were pretty nasty after not being able to bathe for six days.   urlLink    Jon and I at the end of our hike in Yosemite.  Posted by  urlLink Hello    So we got out and handed back in our bear canister and started driving back toward San Francisco. We ended up stopping at a Burger King because we were both really hungry and wanted some good greasy food. Keep in mind how filthy and I'm sure incredibly disgusting we both were. I'm sure we smelled pretty ripe too. I kept getting odd looks from women in the bathrooms. Jon and I ended up staying at a Holiday Inn. I tell you, never has a shower felt so good. It was nice to get six days of dust and grime off my body. Our feet were in rough shape too. I think I'm going to end up loosing a few toe nails and Jon and I both have some massive blisters. We ended up just lounging around the hotel and watching a Rocky marathon on AMC.  The trip though was marvelous. I had such a wonderful time and it was so awesome to get back to nature. You really have this amazing appreciation for mountains and all God's creation when you are walking it. As I told Jon as we drove along the sides of the mountains on our way out of Yosemite, "It just isn't quite the same from the car."

      We spent the day today at Laurel Lake. It is such a nice area. Poor Jon, he finished his book yesterday and thought he had another one but it since he didn't spent most of the day watching ants. That's right, I said watch ants. I just enjoyed sitting around the camp reading my book and enjoying the wilderness. We had kind of hoped that Mr. Bear would come back and we could get some more good pictures of him. But he didn't come back. This morning though Jon gave me a hug and my back was really sore. It turns out I had this massive bruise on my back from where I fell in the lake yesterday. Jon insisted on taking a picture.   urlLink    My wound from falling in the lake.  Posted by  urlLink Hello

      I couldn't post earlier because Jon did something to his computer which screwed up our wireless router and neither one of us had an internet connection. I don't know why I was thinking I needed to post because I have nothing to write about. I really have just spent the day cleaning on the house. It took a little bit of time to get me motivated to do so. I just wasn't feeling it. I was happy though because Jon took back all our pop cans. That is a task that I absolutely hate doing.  Okay, what is it about men? We are watching TV right now and Jon has the remote. He flips and then leaves it on a station just long enough for me to get interested and then he changes the channel! It's a little frustrating. Now I know that this is a man thing and not just my husband thing. Why do you men do this? Are you obsessed with making sure you aren't missing something better? Or is it just a control issue? I don't understand. In the last half hour we have watched about 5 minutes of 5 different shows. We've been going between  Ace Ventura ,  Deliverance , something on the Colts on ESPN (which is surprising because Jon doesn't EVER watch ESPN),  Street Smarts  and some show on Tech TV. I really would have liked him to leave it on ESPN or  Deliverance . Great, now we are watching  Queer Eye.  Seriously, STAY ON ONE CHANNEL!!! I'm sure other ladies out there can sympathize with me on this. Now its on to Olympic Boxing. See for you men out there maybe you can see how ridiculous this channel flipping is. All right, that is enough of my complaining about channel flipping. There are other things that I should be doing now.

      Never fear, Jon just called and is on his way home.  I guess something went wrong at work.  But he's coming home now.  Good news about his health care situation, his company is now going to pay for most of the health care so we will be only paying like $50 a month so that is better.  Need to tend to my dinner.

      Jon isn't home from work yet. I know that he has been having to work late recently but he had told me he wouldn't be as late this week. I just thought he would be home by now. He has really been working a lot lately. I have been getting a lot of quality Riley time. Most of the time it is just Riley and I in the house. I was going to wait for Jon to get home before I had dinner but I had to start mine, I'm getting shaky from not having eaten today. I know that's bad for me but we just don't have a lot of extra food right now. I am making a hearty dinner so never fear. Where is Jon? You know if I didn't know my husband better I would be worried about him having an affair. I asked him the last round of late nights at work if he was and he told me unless I meant with Tim (a guy he works with) he wasn't. I thought I had a right to ask since he sometimes spends the night at work. I know that he is actually at work because his boss has sent me thank yous and I've called him on his work phone number and talked to him. I supposed I could call him but I'm content speculating. Hopefully he is just at work and not laying dead in a ditch somewhere. Oh Heather! That is not even funny to say. [Smacks self in head]  I think Riley is finally starting to get a little bit of his protective instinct. When my cousin Julie was here Riley was doing a serious bark and his fur was standing up on his neck. I know what you are thinking, Julie and her kids are far from threatening but it was someone he doesn't see all that often coming into my house. That makes me feel better that if it was really a person who didn't know Riley that he would protect me. Its good to know considering how much time I've been spending alone in my house lately. Hmmm, where  is  Jon?

       urlLink    Riley's Favorite Way to Sleep  Posted by  urlLink Hello      I took this picture of Riley last night while I was watching the Olympics. He gets sneaky and gets up on the couch after Jon has gone to bed. Well, he's not too sneaky because I let him get up on the couch. I know, I know, I'm not supposed to but look at him. Doesn't he just look so comfy?  My cousin Julie just called. She and the kids are on their way to my house. I suppose I should scurry around and just make sure the house looks a little bit more presentable then it does now. I did get the downstairs bathroom and kitchen cleaned so don't worry, I found some motivation.

      I just got back from taking another application into the U. Just one. I know it is silly but there were no other new postings for research positions. There wasn't a whole lot that I could do about it. I need to keep applying. Oh, but I discovered something bad. I had re-worked my cover letter for this position and as I was proofing it I discovered I had left out a word! Oh, this could be disastrous. Could that be why I haven't heard from those other jobs? I'm almost inclined to say that this is not the case because I am extremely well qualified for these positions but oh goodness what if it is. I am kicking myself for not catching this sooner. Unfortunately there is not a thing I can do about it now.  I had planned on mowing the lawn today but now its raining. So I guess I won't be doing that. I need to clean the house too but I'm not so motivated. I'm sleepy. I had horrible dreams last night and didn't sleep well as a result. They were so awful that it took me a couple hours to get over them this morning. I was disturbed. Even thinking about them now makes me disturbed. I hate it when dreams do stuff like that. Its awful. Well, I've got to find some motivation in me some where and I'm certainly not going to do it posting on my blog so I better stop.

       urlLink Political ad upsets Iraqi players   For some reason lately I've really been feeling like commenting on stories in the news. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that Jon is pretty much indifferent about all things going on in the world so I have to express my opinions somewhere :o)  I just read this article and I have to say that I don't blame the Iraqi players for being upset at all. They have every right to be. To be quite honest with you, when I saw that ad for the first time, it upset me. First of all, how can anyone possible say that Iraq is free? We still have troops there! That's not freedom. Freedom doesn't come with having troops from   another   country occupying your nation. Who's crazy idea of freedom is that? And then Afghanistan, the United States didn't liberate Afghanistan, we bombed the crap out of them. Since when is that liberation?  I completely support the Iraqi soccer team. They have every right to insist that President Bush not use them in his political endeavors. I also support the Iraqi team in the Olympics. I think they are a great story. This is not because of what my country did to "liberate" them but that for once they can play without fear. Good luck to you guys and I'll be cheering along with you in your quest to bring the gold to Iraq.

       urlLink West Nile from Dialysis   Wow that is scary!  All this has a personal account because my grandpa is on dialysis.  The scariness increases since West Nile has been found on the street my grandparents live on and my grandma has found two dead birds in her yard!  Since my grandpa is also on chemotherapy drugs he is much more susceptible to infection.  I makes me a little scared for my grandpa.  He is starting to feel better and is playing golf again.  Contracting West Nile would be disastrous.  I suppose I should not worry about it because the chances of that happening are pretty slim.  At least that is what I am going to tell myself...Grandpa is not going to get West Nile.

      While I was at my interview Jon got some rather upsetting news. The health insurance his company has decided to increase its rates. But the increase is ridiculous. They increased the rate five fold! How much he has to pay now is more than 10% of his  GROSS  pay. There is no way we can afford that increase. It really only goes up for two of the employees because they are the only two who have spouses on their insurance. Ironically, they are the two hardest working employees they have. Their CFO is not there right now and that is who he needs to complain to. Like I said, there is no way we can afford that. I told Jon that he should get a pay raise to compensate for that increase. It is SO significant. But enough of that because it is just making me angry.  I think that my interview went well. It ended up going 45 minutes longer than expected. I think that is a good sign. I'm not overly excited about the work but the benefits are really nice and given our current benefit situation it would be nice. This company that I interviewed with pay for 100% of the benefits both medical and dental. And they are talking about adding vision. There is also disability and 401k options. I won't mind the work and I have no problem with working a 9 to 5 kind of job. I'll take it.

      I have to leave for my interview in 10 minutes. I'm nervous. I don't know why. I usually don't get nervous for things like this. Yesterday, I went through a bunch of scenarios with Jon about what happens if. He helps hire people at his company so he is a good one to ask. I haven't heard from any of the jobs at the U but I am not giving up hope just yet. There is another one that I want to apply to but considering I have to drive there to turn in the application I wanted to wait until I had more than one. But I will take it Friday regardless. I'm nervous and I feel my stomach starting to twinge. It can't go off on me now, it can't! Okay, going to run through a last minute check to make sure I have everything I need. Wish me luck!

      I am watching the women's team final for gymnastics right now. I am completely amazed that the talent of these girls. For one thing, they are so strong! I can't imagine having the strength that it must require to do so many of these routines. One of the events that probably amazes me the most is the balance beam. I don't even think I could walk across one with out falling on my face but they are able to do all these crazy tumbling moves and flips and stuff. WOW. Although to be quite honest with you if I tried any of those events I'd probably fall on my face. Yes, that even includes the floor exercise. I'm sure I'd trip over my shoelaces or something there. The other part that amazes me is their strength combined with their elegance. It also seems like all those girls are just so adorable. Of course most of them are like 12 but they are so cute.   urlLink    Russia's Svetlana Khorkina performs her routine on the balance beam during women's gymnastics team finals at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Tuesday, Aug. 17, 2004.

      What was I thinking when I decided to go back and post my thoughts over the past three years of my life? Clearly, I wasn't. It is turning into quite at task considering most of these entries are scratched down in various notebooks. I'm surprised I was able to find them all. Since I've decided to go and replace my archaic way of journaling I'm doing it all the way. That is me though, all the way or no way. The only problem is, now I'm fixated on getting it done. I am actually finding it rather interesting to be going back and reading my thoughts from what seems like so long ago. It makes my decision to change from mircobiology to ministry seem less outrageous. Looking back over these notes my only response (however ineloquent it might be) is, "DUH! No wonder you are changing career paths." It has also been interesting to go back and read my thoughts on  urlLink September 11 . You can check it out if you are interested. Hmm, I actually had a point to this posting when I started but I'm not sure what it is anymore. Well, since I don't have a point anyway, I might as well keep rambling, right? You can stop reading now, I won't be offended.  I think that it is going to rain today. My knees are really bothering me (thank you knee surgery.) They tend to do this before storms. Darn that low pressure. I have noticed that fall is starting to creep up on us. The nights have become noticeably short and it is pretty cool at night now. It doesn't feel like summer could possibly be about over. I think maybe because it has rained an insane amount this summer. I would say we are averaging at least a thunderstorm a week. This is more than I can ever remember. Well, I suppose I should stop boring you people and get things going with my day.

      Well, it turns out that message was from the company that I heard from last week.  I have a job interview set up for Wednesday afternoon.  She said it would take most of the afternoon and that I would be meeting with her and four other people.  I really think that I would like to hear from one of those jobs at the U before I have to make a decision about this job.  I'm just not overly excited about what I would be doing.  We'll see how the interview goes, who knows maybe the people will be completely awesome and it won't matter that the techniques I'll be doing will be a snooze.

      I caved in this afternoon and called the doctor. I hate going to the doctor but I needed to do it. I needed to go back anyway for a follow up for my depression but there a couple other health issues that I need to address. For one thing, I have this funky rash on my leg that is getting bigger and really itches. But really the bigger issue is that my colitis has flared up and I cannot seem to get it back under control. I think that is probably more the reason why I have lost four pounds. I'm not really eating right now because everytime I eat I get sick. This has been going on for about three weeks now. I'm not sure if our backpacking trip screwed my digestive system up or what. I'm really having to be careful about what I eat right now and just about everything is setting me off. I'm sure this has a lot to do with my fatigue and screwy sleeping schedule. I'm just not getting the proper amount of nutrients and calories that my body needs. But there is little that I can do. Enough about this.  I talked to my mom last night and it turns out that my aunt did end up right in the path of Hurricane Charley. The place they were staying was only about 20 miles from where Charley hit land so they had decided to go inland but then thought they were inland enough so went just north of Orlando and old Charley followed them the whole way. But she and all her traveling companions are okay and the lady whose trailer she was staying still has there trailer and power. It will be neat to hear her story when she gets back.  I got an e-mail from human resources at the U and my applications have been submitted to the hirer. It was nice because they sent automated e-mails if you don't get the job. I'm hoping that I will be hearing from at least one of them sometime this week. I am also still waiting to hear from that flow job. The human resources department was supposed to be calling me. I'm thinking if I haven't heard from them by Thursday I'll have to call that guy back and let him know. I'm really hoping that by the end of the week I will have a couple interviews set up. Hmmm, I just got a voice mail message but my phone didn't ring. Better go check that out. I'll post this now in case of any computer disasters while I'm checking my voice mail.

       urlLink    Riley at 9 months.  Posted by  urlLink Hello   I found this picture the other day of Riley that I had taken about a month ago. I thought it was a really nice picture so I thought I would share it. See, he doesn't really look like a rabbit killer. I have gotten over the whole rabbit incident and Riley has moved on too. I know it sounds silly but we were both mad at each other. I was mad because of the whole rabbit incident. He was mad at me because I took the rabbit away from him and then I made him stay outside (he's an odd dog in that he really doesn't like to be outside much.) But we are now reconciled.

      We just got home from having dinner with Jon's family. We went and had dinner for his sister's birthday. It's always interesting spending time with Jon's family. They are all so goodie-goodie that it really makes me look like I'm the spawn of Satan. Well, maybe not his youngest sister, Juli. They all think she is some wild child but in reality, she is just normal. For example, she is 19 and heading over to Canada next weekend. Somehow, I don't think her parents  really  know why she is going over to Canada. But she's fun. The sister whose birthday it was...well, let's just say she's a little conservative. But, dinner was nice and really, I couldn't complain. Given the fact that we have almost no money it was nice to get a nice, free dinner.  Not only did we get a nice, free dinner we also got a movie! After dinner, Jon and I went with his dad and sisters to see   urlLink The Bourne Supremacy   (his mom saw  The Princess Diaries 2. ) I liked the movie but now I need to go back and see  urlLink  The Bourne Identity   because I can't really remember how it ended. The movie was good and of course Matt Damon looked good so for the ladies there is some nice eye candy. Jon and I were discussing this and we both agree that all in all Matt Damon makes much better movies than Ben Affleck and in our opinion is a better actor. But anyway, we are home now and Riley is happy to be out of his crate. He is giving me looks like, "Come on Mom, it's bedtime." So, good night.

      I love the  urlLink Olympics ! Winter, summer, it doesn't matter to me I just love them. I'm so excited because I'm going to watch the opening ceremonies in about 10 minutes here. I am annoyed that they aren't airing them live on any American station. I have to watch it on the Canadian station. What is wrong with America? It's the Olympics! I think we need to learn a lesson from our Northern neighbor here. Air the Olympics! Since I'm not working right now I'll be able to watch them. I'm seriously so excited. I know, I'm a dork but I just love the national pride that comes with the Olympics. I love supporting my country and chanting "U-S-A! U-S-A!" What I find so great is that this is the only time where we come together as a country. No one fights over who they want to win the Gold in the Olympics. Its a no brainer...America! That is what I love about the Olympics. I also love supporting that one athlete from that tiny country I've never heard of when they win the Gold. To me the Olympics represent peace and there is comrodery both within the nations and between them. At what other time do we see this? I think we could all learn a lesson from the Olympic athletes.

      I just had to kill a rabbit.  I was out mowing the lawn and Riley was out there with me playing some kind of game he made up in his head with the lawn mower. I noticed him chasing something along the fence line and then saw a rabbit dart under the fence and into our yard. Well, it took about 30 seconds for Riley to catch it and he was mouthing it around. By the time I got the lawn mower off and ran over to stop him, he had punctured the rabbit's head with his canine and blood was gushing out of its head. It was still alive. I just stood there for a minute trying to decide what to do. I knew that the rabbit was not going to live and that I had to stop it's suffering. I didn't know what to use so I got a shovel and hit it on the head. I had to hit it a couple times before it died. Then I buried it. But Riley just dug it up and was carrying it around the yard. I think he ate it. I can't finish mowing the lawn right now.

      I just got a call from a guy at one of the jobs I applied for. He was calling me to fill me in a little bit more on the job. I figured I might as well go in and at least see the facility and check things out. No harm going for an interview. He is having someone from his HR department call me to set up an interview hopefully sometime next week. I'm not sure how interested in this I am since it is a core facility and would be more of a high throughput type of job but I have sometime before the interview and hopefully I will be hearing on some of the other jobs I applied for and I will have some options. I guess a big benefit would be that I would be able to go in, put in my hours and come home. I think I am looking for that right now. But, I guess we'll see what happens.

       urlLink CNN.com - Storms put squeeze on Florida - Aug 12, 2004   First of all, for all the people in who live in Florida, know that my prayers are with you as these storms approach.  I cannot even begin to imagine how you must feel.  I now have concern on a personal level.  My aunt is in Florida.  I have a wonderful relationship with my aunt.  She has always been like a second mother to me.  I have always been able to share things with her and not worry about them getting back to my mom.  Now that I am older she and my mom have become my friends.  I go to them both when I need insight on life.  Who better than to advise me then two people who have been through it?  When she left for Florida on Saturday I have to admit I had a bit of myself in mind when I didn't want her to go.  How was I going to go two weeks without my Aunt Carole?  Now, I just hope that she is safe.  And more than ever I want her home.

      For those of you who may be confused about what is going on with my blog.  I'm trying to back-blog and get all of my entries into one place.  This goes back 3 years so it will take some time.  Bear with me and try not to get too confused.

      I just got home from taking my job applications to the university. Again, I would just like to re-iterate how irritating it was that I had to drive 15 minutes down to the U and then drive around for another 10 trying to find the stupid building only to walk into the human resources department to hand my stack of papers to a receptionist and then leave. So, 25 minutes of driving for 30 seconds of time in human resources. HELLO! E-MAIL! Step into the 21st century. Seriously, why was it necessary for me to do that in person? Its not even like the person I gave the applications to will have any say in my hiring.  There was a bright side though. Since I was already out and have been in a state of continual hunger for the last 3 days I stopped by the grocery store and got a few groceries. Jon took out some of the pork that we had in the freezer and so tomorrow we will have pulled pork but I got some potatoes because they are cheap and filling. I also had to get some grapes because I need to get some fruit in me. I don't think that is so much to ask.  Well, all my applications are in and while I am still checking daily for new postings I think it is time for the waiting game to begin.

      I just got home from a meeting at my church for Christian Education. I will now be coordinating three different things this fall. Along with my role as leader of the Tweens (5th-8th grade) Youth group, I will also be coordinator for the one room Sunday School and leading the adult Bible Study on Wednesday evenings. I may be completely out of my mind. I wonder what Jon is going to say when I tell him. Well, I feel that God is pulling me in this situation and I know that my Lord will give me the strength to do God's work.  I still may be crazy though.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - High Schoolers: Military Draft Will Resume   I ran across this article on Yahoo! today. Back when the war started I remember there being some rumors of a new draft. It would be revised so that people in college and women were eligible. Of course there were a lot of congressmen who were against such a thing. But with the war in Iraq going on longer than we all expected and our troops loosing their lives more now that before a draft is seeming less and less out of the question. I fear that the situation in Iraq is going to lead into another Vietnam. You would think that we would have learned from our previous mistakes. I know that the whole situation is very delicate and I know that I don't understand it all but our troops have already been deployed longer than they expected and reserves are now being called into active duty. Will a draft be next? I certainly hope the conflict is resolved before we ever get to that point.

       urlLink    Riley as a baby.  I just thought I would test things out and see how publishing pictures works. I thought what better to post than a picture of my baby when he was a baby. Isn't he cute?

      Well, tomorrow I will have applied to six jobs.  I say tomorrow because for the four that I am applying to at the university I have to actually go to an office and hand in the applications.  That annoys me slightly but I think I am well qualified for them so its worth a shot.  See all I needed to do yesterday is get myself motivated on that cover letter.  I am of course modifying it for every posting as I'm sure the last thing employers want to read is some non-personal generic cover letter.  So, I will be keeping my fingers crossed and saying a prayer or two that one of these six will work out.  I mean one has to right?  Jon and I can't go on not buying groceries forever.  We will eventually run completely out of food and Riley needs to eat too.  Something will work out soon.  I just know it.  While I have your attention I have to bring up something I heard on the radio this morning or at least think I heard.  You know how it is when you are waking up to the radio, you're kinda groggy and not real sure what's going on.  Well, I think I heard them giving the news and tell of this story about this guy whose wife wouldn't have sex with him for two nights.  So, I guess to get back at her, he cut off his penis and chopped it up into little pieces.  By the bazaare nature of the story you can understand why I'm not entirely sure I heard that one correctly.  But let's assume for a second that I did.  WOW!  That guy is a wacko!  And my question is, why did he thinking cutting his penis off would get back at his wife?  She clearly didn't want to have sex with him anyway so cutting off his penis solves that problem.  She's probably happy.  Although I guess we ladies should realize how crazy sex-deprived men can be so we should be careful.  Yikes!

      It's 10:00 pm and I just applied to a job.  Ah, the beauty of the internet.  It makes job hunting so much nicer.  No flipping through piles of newspapers.  Is that how people used to do it before such things at hotjobs.com and monster?  Must be.  Wow, that must have sucked.  Makes me really thankful for technology.  This job I applied for is doing things I've done before, but surprise surprise, I've done it all.  That's right, I'm a science whore.  It's doing FACS analysis though and I HATE FACS.  Although, maybe that was because I hated the lab that I was doing it in and the machine sucked.  Oh well, it would be a paycheck and that's really all I'm after right now.

      I hate job searching. So, of course I seem to try and do anything I possibly can to avoid it. I just can't find the motivation to write my cover letter. I'm so bad at "tooting my own horn" so to speak. It just feels wrong. Perhaps this is why I keep putting it off. But you know now its close to dinnertime so I can put off writing it until after dinner. Instead, I'd rather write here. Not that I have anything interesting to say here but sometimes I just like to ramble. I suppose this is one of those times where I want to ramble. After all I am putting off doing something. I've done about all I can to put it off. Made dinner, did laundry, read. I suppose after dinner I'll have to write the stupid letter. Mmm...dinner smells good. Oh yea! Its ready.

      You know it was fun being unemployed there for awhile. I didn't have to get up, I didn't have to fight traffic, I could stay home with Riley. Now, money's getting tight, I'm starting to get bored and Jon's going to kill me if I don't find something soon...I WANT A JOB! So, I'm job hunting. I changing career paths but since all my experience is in science and lab work that is where I'm looking. I have 6 years of lab experience. That's right, do the math, I've been working in labs since I was 18. I worked all four years of college. Tons of experience should equal easy job finding, right? WRONG! Perhaps I wouldn't have such a hard time finding a job if there were actually jobs available! I mentioned before the job at the Red Cross. That was being set up through a temp agency. When I interviewed with the temp agency they told me they'd let me know one way or the other around the beginning of August. So, its the beginning of August and I hadn't heard anything from them. So, I e-mail them this morning. At least they were kind enough to e-mail me back but listen to this:    It turned out that the Red Cross only needed one, part-time position for the early august start date, which has already been filled.        So, it looks like I am back to square one. This is incredibly irritating but I suppose there is really nothing more I can do but keep hunting.

      Well, a mere four hours after finally falling asleep, I'm awake again.  Who really needs sleep anyway?  I think there was a fire or if not a fire a very serious accident this morning.  Seeing that we live on the major road that connects the police, fire and ambulance to the freeway we pretty much know whenever something happens.  I saw...and heard...about four or five large fire trucks go by and a couple ambulances.  I was very loud for awhile.  I suppose it didn't help that we had our window open either.  After the first round of sirens, Riley decided that it freaked him out so he climbed up on the bed and plopped down on my legs.  This is a problem because he weights over 70 pounds.  With that, the sirens and Jon hitting the snooze every 10 minutes I gave up on sleep and got up.  So, now I'm up.  I suppose I shall start my day.

      There really seems to be nothing worse than not being able to sleep. Its like my body is on west coast time...This is a problem seeing that I am not on the west coast. I tried to go to bed when Jon beckoned but just laid there unable to sleep. Sadly, I don't seem to be able to come up with a remedy. I sleep much better during the day for whatever reason. This is in part why the job with the Red Cross that I interviewed for would work out well. It was third shift. I wouldn't have a problem with that since I'm awake a good majority of the third shift now. Regardless, I need to get a job soon. I'm not sure how much longer we can go on in our current money situation. I mean, we are already not buying groceries or anything else for that matter. I take that back...gas...we buy gas. On the positive side of no groceries I've lost three pounds. Of course I'd rather be eating.  One thing I've learned from not sleeping is that there really is nothing on TV after like 1 am. I guess they figure most people are asleep but what about those of us who aren't? Why must we suffer with horrible paid programming? Sometimes we get lucky and can find a movie on but it seems like most movies have taken the tone of Cinemax (or Skinemax as I call at night.) I don't want to watch that. I just find it frustrating that out of 100 plus channels there isn't a single one that can come up with decent programming for those insomniacs out there.  Well, enough griping by me. I suppose it is time for me to attempt sleep once again. Wish me luck.

      Oh today was just one of those days that was far too hard to get motivated.  After church my husband, Jon and I had to swing by the local grocery store to get some buns.  Being that we are in a current money crisis $.99 hot dog and hamburger buns were about all we could afford.  Sad, I know.  So we got the buns and since I had the cash and Coke was also $.99 I got a 2-liter of Coke.  Lunch was hot dogs on the grill.  I had planned on going to Sue's candle party at 2:00 but ended up falling asleep.  Not that I cared too much for two reasons: 1. I don't have any money with which to buy candles and 2.  I hate going to these ridiculous parties where you feel obligated to buy something...seriously when did this become trendy?  Especially with this particular type of candle party, for some reason the person selling the candles always tries to trick you into scheduling a party of your own.  So all in all I think the nap did me more good than the candle party.  I feel bad that I told Sue I would go and then didn't show up but she'll forgive me given that she knows my thoughts of these parties...yet I still continue to be invited...hmm.  After waking up from my nap I found that napping did not give me any further motivation.  Of course it didn't help that Jon had made himself cozy on the couch watching movies on TV.  Even my dog, Riley, didn't seem to have much motivation as he found himself to be quite content curled up on his blanket snoozing.  So, I found myself streched out on the ever-so comfortable Lazy Boy with my computer on my lap screwing around.  I found my solace in Rollercoaster Tycoon.  I like loosing my mind in these types of simulation games.  After awhile Jon went upstairs also to screw around on his computer and I turned to my devotionals and daily Bible readings.  For some reason I still insist on doing them in five translations.  I get more out of them I guess.  Or I'm just crazy which is entirely possible.  So doing my devotionals was about the extent of things I got done today.  Oh well, I'm allowed lazy days every once in a while, right?  I suppose I should post this and head upstairs to bed since Jon keeps calling down to me.  It seems he is ready to "pester" me as he likes to put it.  Riley also appears ready for bed as he is streched out on the couch on his back with paws in the air.  I suppose I should also find myself in bed asleep.

      Well, we all know what a sucker I am. Jon and I just got back from watching 5 kids. Julie had called a couple weeks ago and asked if we could come and help her dad watch her two kids and David's sister's three kids. Of course, me being the sucker that I am said yes. To be quite honest it wasn't so bad. Jacob and Ellie were of course ecstatic to see me. Especially Jacob but he is my little buddy. Ellie was happy to see Jon. I think she has a little crush on him and its cute. I wasn't at all worried about Jacob and Ellie because I have taken care of them countless times by myself. David's sister's children concerned me a bit more. She was worried about the baby, Zack, because I guess he doesn't do so well when she and her husband leave him. But I had no problem with him and he came to me with out a problem and let me change his diaper and get his pajamas on him with out any fuss. Alex, the little girl who is 6, just played with Jacob and Ellie so she didn't create any problems. She did get a little cranky toward the end but it was no big deal. Tad is about 8 maybe but he is autistic. He was no problem whatsoever since he just sat on the couch and played Game Boy the entire evening. It was a little odd because I'd try to ask him if he was hungry or thirsty or anything and he would just ignore me. My uncle and Jon did a lot of playing with the older kids and I pretty much took care of the baby. Jacob was less pleased because I didn't get to play with him as much. My uncle had things under control once Tad and the baby went to bed so Jon and I took off. We made $40. I always feel bad taking money but I do get called on to baby-sit a lot.

      So, I just got off the phone with Amanda. It was really good to talk to her but she told me something that I found amusing. I guess a couple days after Jon and I got back from Yosemite Lisa called Amanda and asked if she had heard from me. Amanda said she hadn't but she knew that Jon and I had been in California. So, Lisa tells Amanda how she's scared that Jon and I died out in the wilderness. A week or so go by and I hadn't e-mailed Amanda yet and Lisa talks to Amanda again. Now Lisa is freaking out because no one had heard from me and she was convinced that Jon and I were dead. Keep in mind she hadn't tried to call me herself. I guess she then tried to call me but I never got a message from her so she was even more freaked out. Finally, I had talked to Amanda and Amanda told Lisa and Lisa got calmed down. So, after I got off the phone with Amanda I called Lisa. Lisa didn't answer her phone so I left a message that I was okay. I doubt I'll hear from her but I just thought that was funny.

      I took Riley to meet my breeder at MSU to do the heart screening.  Three of his littermates were there and it was so neat to see how different the four of them looked.  Riley looks so little compared to them.  But anyway, all of the dogs heart screens turned out okay which was a huge relief.  I was really worried about Riley.  We all were, they are our babies.  So good news, Riley is okay.

      Earlier today as I was getting the bills together to be mailed my mom called me to ask if I was coming up for dinner. I told her that I planned on it and she told me that we were having a fish fry. On Monday, she, Ronnie and my Grandpa went fishing and caught 27 blue gill so we were going to have them for dinner tonight. I got really excited because it had been years since I'd had blue gill and I love blue gill. So, I headed up to P-town and stopped by my mom's shop. I have Riley with me since I'm taking him to MSU tomorrow for his heart screening. She had a customer so I walked down to my grandma's. I saw in her fridge the fish. I was excited because that meant Grandpa had filleted them and he does a great job. I got even more excited when I learned that Grandpa was doing the frying too. I love the way Grandpa does blue gill. When I was younger, whenever Grandma and Grandpa had blue gill for dinner I'd always stick around and eats tons and tons of them. Tonight was no exception. I ate so many blue gill that I made my stomach hurt. But, oh it was so worth it.
