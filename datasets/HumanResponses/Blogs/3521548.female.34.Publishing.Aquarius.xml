      so here i am at the christian booksellers convention.  it's a cool time for me, really.  most of my year i'm writing away in little ole cottonwood, and then powie, i get to hang out with my favorite writer friends.  i stay in hotels that i usually can't afford (they give discounts and i pile in friends). i see and meet a few famous people or once-were famous or lukewarm famous people too -- hey, i like them all.  and some people actually act like i'm a little famous which is rather a kick.  two dear people in my booksigning line mentioned their disappointment over my first three novels all going to out-of-print purgatory this year.  bless them, i wanted to take them home with me.      i get to wear all my dressy clothes and shoes and feel prettied-up for author dinners and events.  browsing the floor, i see all the new books, cool covers, spot christian music artists, rush over to old friends, set up meetings both semi-important and then just plain fun.  talk about the future, the ideas, the vision, the plans, the things we've learned, the things we'd wished to never know.  and i haven't even begun to mention the writer's retreat before cba begins, or the intense discussions or plans for my trip to the philippines in november.  people expand my world, and i love them and they love me.  you see the best of people and are reminded or given fresh views of god love, his grace, and his intimate reach around the world.        and then there is the downside.  the convention is for displaying new products.  christian products, if you will.  though how really does a product understand its need for grace?  so, among the christian stuff, i find things that i like.  books, i'm bringing home tons of books.  and other things too.  but then, then, then, oh then, there is the crap, if you will.  and i mean crap spelled s-h-i-t.  really, will a christian in-soles (IN SOULS), you know those padded things for your shoes, truly help me live a better life in christ?  (and i came up with that idea years ago as a joke, and now someone has a booth and product) and then, the scripture mints, the stickers, the flower arrangements, framed quotes...anything and everything you can think up that can hold a verse and sell, really they're selling what it cost christ to die for mankind.   how about some toilet paper?   WHY ARE THESE THINGS FOR SALE?  WHY ARE PEOPLE BUYING THEM? HOW CAN THIS BE A MARKET?  no one thought my sleeping bag roller-upper was a good enough idea.  or what about the body cup holder (hands-free coffee for the gal on the go!).  or...hey, maybe if i put a scripture verse on that.  and the thing is, people don't get outraged about it (well some do), but not enough really, cause it has a verse and so must be christian (is this the thinking?).  but i'll get disapproval for saying shit.     god can use anything, and will.  someone's life will be moved by a mint with a scripture on it.  but that doesn't stop the disgust of motives behind it.  i mean, enough already.       now, i really don't mind being told i'm wrong.  i'm wrong all the time to such a degree i'm forever doubting myself.  so tell me, if you know.  am i wrong here?    i'll miss cba, the people, the events, the energy.  it's been a great one, and i'm grateful for it. grateful for so many things i see in my mind right now, and wish to write each one.  wow, i thank god for them.    home in the morning (missing home) and with the sleep i've had, that flight will be a blink.

      what do you want?  at the core of your being, not just what shiny car, what do you really desire? and what do fear, the most? (make a list) when the feared comes true, how will you survive?  what keeps you from the want that is also part of the purpose for life on planet earth?  what happens in the next life if you miss the purpose of this one?    at the end of the end of the day, will you have loved who you were meant to love, what will you wish to have done, who will you wish to have known, what will you wish to have changed? will you have loved enough? can you love too much?  questions for me, and you.  god, will you redeem this life every morning and help me answer?

      atlanta, georgia.  floor to ceiling glass gives a great view of the atlanta skyline.    flying today, i slept a bit and awoke to think i was coming into salzburg for a moment.  had that sudden sense of a place and longed for it.     and glimpses, more glimpses.  i feel the need for a life that matters, for a purpose, for a reason beyond myself.  easy to let myself forget such need, get caught in the moment.    flying away from the majority of people I love (those close by and those distant), i thought of each one.  wondered at the moment i first loved them and which ones i most needed and/or wished for love back. travel always makes me feel small. and makes me want to see the world even more. also makes me long for things i sometimes don't quite grasp.  rambling now. off to bed, but reports from cba soon....

      two writer friends were god-sends in the past few days: one on the phone from chicago -- just talking writing plans and dreams with him brought alive something that was a little sleepy.    another friend called from an airport between north africa and atlanta -somehow minneapolis became one of her connections.  i'll be rooming with her in a few days and see her once a year, unless i make it to the netherlands where she lives on rotterdam harbor.  she never fails to inspire.    leaving for atlanta in a few hours for the christian booksellers convention.  i will be reporting from there and will include phenomenal facts and insider commentary.  this evening -- family competitions -- i defended my title as air hockey champion, won at go-cart races (okay, i did take off well before the light turned green, but i didn't know there was a light), played video games and my first laser tag (what fun is that), watched in amazement at my children, how i love them!  saw a bumper sticker: it's never too late for a good childhood.  i have a bit of peter pan in me.        quote: "velour sweatshirts, for sure, but not baby pink or blue.  maroon or fuchsia are always in style." from "Style Tips for Heavy Eaters" in The Sopranos Cookbook.

      could i stop writing?  what would it do to me?  is it even possible?  wouldn't i always be one in my head, mentally writing things down, seeking that perfect description, grabbing onto things said around me, amazed by a sentence or word, or anxious to move my fingers in accordance to a thought?     or does it feel impossible because it's something i don't want to give up?  wouldn't it be an easier life?  i might be more organized, a better wife and parent perhaps, a better friend and correspondent.  or would i?  i have lived through things i needed but lost, got up another day because as humans we must, especially with people depending on us.    these are certainly not new musings.  but tonight, or rather early morning, they return.  hey, a bug is swimming in my cup and i'm suddenly thirsty.       grace and god's guidance to you with your musings.

      monday seems a good day to rethink and set new writing goals, sort of the new years day of the week (new years day is never as fun as new years eve, but it is the actual beginning).  as i floated on an air mattress yesterday and swam a bit, i tried to consider where to go now.  not writing is getting to me.  it's like an ache in the stomach that grows, i feel it as i type this.  thus some monday goals.      i leave for atlanta thursday (christian booksellers convention) and as with most of my trips, i don't feel ready (though i do need this i think).  it takes until that plane tips off the ground to say, "okay, i'm going, i can't do anything more at home, can't feel bad for leaving, now i'll focus on what this will be."  since i'm rather directionless at the moment, hoping it provides a little.  meeting with my agent and writing friends should help.  some help too from time to think and pray and sleep (yeah right, i'm in atlanta with friends).  in many ways, life would be easier without writing.  but could i live through it?  monday writing plann-eo: 1000 new words (at least) on writing experiment and put together some of the pieces -- see if they make anything.  wimpy goal, yes, but trying to be realistic with what this week means.     also, create game plan for atlanta.    "you don't remember me, but i remember you."  just heard that on the evanescence cd playing through my computer, liked it.  maybe i'll put something of it in my writing experiment.

      sometimes i can be such a sarcastic little twit, and yet the irritation doesn't leave me even while identifying such flaws.  i'll just apologize in advance if this hurts feelings.  but i have to say this.  i just don't understand why many christians often say, "praise the lord" or "thank you jesus" or "exalt his name" or "rejoicing in him" but ONLY when something goes our way.  i mean, when something goes our way, that often means it didn't go someone elses.    i'm all for gratitude and such, don't get me wrong here.  but what about praising god even when life sucks?  what about rejoicing in him when there's nothing or no one else to rejoice in?  how often do christians say, "praise god, my car broke down, i'm in deep debt, i didn't get the promotion, my child said his first swear word and i'm rather suicidal today."  so often the bad is the devil and the good means we're blessed.  what about blessed are the poor in spirit?  blessed are those who suffer...and all those mystifying words from that hillside chat.    this wasn't supposed to be a rant, but it somewhat is.  however, of writing value, today i chose this word and it's variants:  mystify, mystic, mystical .  i just said each slowly and find them of delight.  and for my jenna jane, how about some  ambiguity , i always liked that word until we said it two hundred times yesterday.  any words to add that just sound great?  i sure have my list of despised words, but i despise them too much to write them here.

      this morning i think not only of the pain we carry, but the pain we cause.  this life journey creates it.    i've never intended to hurt anyone, well, i'm sure a few times though i'm presently mentally blocking them. whether from simply not returning a phone call, not reading someone's writing...not doing any number of things to the actually doing of -- hurt can happen and i'm the cause.  like trying to do what's best for everyone which is most often impossible and someone gets hurt.  or trying and wanting to love selflessly and yet needing love desperately too.  or...well, this could go on and on.    somewhere i have lewis' "the problem with pain" though it's probably packed for the forthcoming move.  and more scary and weird dreams after my late blogging.  weird one was that my new writing spot was on a skinny platform (like a giant lifeguard station) perched out in the ocean.  i had to swim to get there (hmmmm) and when i'd finish writing and was feeling brave, I'd jump the 60ish feet to the water (where did my laptop go after work?).  i watched a black stingray, then a whale, and wondered if i was brave enough to jump that day.  so, analyze that.    anyway, who wouldn't agree that it's worse to be the cause of pain than to carry it?  maybe those people who can move on and not look back.  i'm not one of those, which sometimes feels unfortunate.

      for no apparent reason, today i was thinking about the pain we all carry.    i pictured the faces before me from my husband, family members, and a trail of friends, and with each their pain seemed suddenly vivid -- nearly a color or image. then thoughts went to acquaintances who i've often been surprised to find what they've carried, or the many hastily resown hearts.  we've no idea what each other has inside.  such scars and unhealed wounds. they can't be compared to each other, each individual's experience comes in different weights.  i considered my own too and wondered how we all do it.  how do we get up sometimes?  later, i stopped by the traveling viet nam wall with my oldest son and daughter and my niece.  yes, "stopped by" which felt rather disrespectful.  my father was in viet nam when i was born, and i wished to know the names he could recognize there.  we watched a man trace the name of someone he knew.  i read wishing to speak each one aloud and know them for a moment.  what enormity of pain in each one.        another matchbox twenty quote (oh, that rob thomas), "there's no one around who can tell us what we're here for."  such could be a quest of mine, to know why we're here.  i mean really.  my need for christ is part of that quest, but all the old answers don't work for me (such as, "to go out and share christ."  yeah, that's worked great, so all this pain has been well worth it).  robert benson writes something of this in  between the dreaming and the coming true . this from memory and my own thoughts too...but,   can we see or experience light without having been in the dark?   could we know joy without some sorrow?   is beauty beautiful because of the ugly to contrast?   for us to love must we also feel pain, even the pain of love?   is the loneliness required to someday feel complete?   and must we be separated from god to truly discover him or to need him or yearn for him or recognize our need and want of him?    somehow among these, i feel it connects with a required divine sacrifice for human redemption.      wonder if robert benson has a blog?  i'd be stopping by if so; his books amaze me.    anyway, i'm much more philosophical silly-putty than any kind of theologian.  maybe sleep will bring something more, lately sleep's been overflowing with dreams.  some scary, others painful.  so i'm tossing thoughts to see what returns.

      "faith in fiction" blog starts a discussion monday on one of my very favorite novels:  my name is asher lev  by chaim potok.  if you haven't read this book, you must!  especially writers and other artists.  and join or at least pop in to  urlLink david long's faith in fiction  for conversation.  i'm anticipating.  but next thursday, i leave for atlanta and the christian booksellers convention (cba) so might miss some, but hope not much.  and cba, now there's a discussion.  the reunions are longed for like my best writing friends, one as far away as holland.          today's writing chronicle: a few paragraphs on writing experiment tentatively called  clockworks  or  3AM .  this project began over a year ago and keeps going.  i thought it was two separate stories and called them:  two weeks  and  3AM .  then they merged and now we have  clockworks , perhaps.  fun stuff.  no deadline.  very different writing for me.  a general market audience, but strong redemption message.  every one of my stories seems to be a redemption story of some sort.  just like my life. and answering reader letters...wow, that never fails to amaze me.    something musically interesting is on letterman, a rap group not sure who.    night night, cee  ps.  hi a.d.

      i went swimming yesterday. at last, and how i'd forgotten.  there's a nice lake near my house and soon i'll be moving to its shore, so it's often that i see it.  water never fails to hypnotize me, i could stare at it for hours.  but i haven't been swimming there since last year, last year when life was utter chaos.    i almost didn't go.  my hair was washed already, makeup done, and i had my writers group in several hours.  then my seven year old lured me in to swim with him, so i was halfway there.  funny how i can sit and consider and sometimes not do what i need so desperately, some practical thing keeps my feet on the ground.    finally, i asked my sister-in-law katie, "do you mind watching the kids?" "you're going across?"  katie knows, we've been friends since third grade and then married brothers, quite conveniently.  so i left everyone and went to my spot.  it was windy and the water a little wild.  the cold crept over my skin, physical exhilaration.  there's a stiff line between air and water; the surface we call it though it should be named something else.  it's rather a doorway, but that doesn't quite work either.  when i've had a mask, i like to put that water line halfway up so as to view both sides.  whatever that line or veil is called or should be, i was in it. lungs in need of air brought me up, everything else was taken in, so struck by that other place, consumed and at one.  it's a whole other world, truly a step closer to the eternal, i think.  always near, yet completely foreign to the world i inhabit.  you can actually hear peace underwater.  i'm weightless and have a sense of freedom unfound anywhere in the world of air and earth.  friends have mentioned such deterrents as large fish and things in the dark down deep, and sometimes that thought has made me pause.  but not when i'm there.  the magic of water takes over then and fish or creatures of any size are simply comrades in our liquid kingdom.  it's like flying, or maybe better.    on the other side of the lake, i sunk my feet into the slimy, thick mud and felt six years old.  staring back, i could see the kids and katie all appearing so "away" and none saw me.  the light too was oblivious to everything except it's dance on the tips of those waves.  it was another perfect moment.  a wider glimpse.  a reminder of all that's right beyond my sight especially when i won't allow myself to see.    and so, no more whining, i told myself as i've told myself before.  no more eeyore whining (as a friend would say).  i'll swim instead.  swim and swim.  of course, whenever these moments happen, it seems we come from our enlightenment to be slapped around a bit.  the rest of the day had some of that and i wanted to sink into the earth again, so quickly i forget the places barely separate from us.  so i hope to go swimming again today. when i move, my neighbors might hate me.  they'll say, when does that crazy women ever DO anything.  but it's when i forget that i begin to unravel.  and my god how i need him, and how i need water.        it's summer, i might just stay there.

      for many aspiring and professional writers, we've all heard about tightening our writing, or writing tight.  the goal is streamlined sharp prose that can be lyrical but has chopped the fluff and self-indulgent crap (you know, the stuff allowed in blogs).  so here's a great tip in developing sharp writing.  ready?  it's worthy of some attention...  very important...  are you paying attention?  here it comes...  TEXT MESSAGING tah dah!!!!  yes, i'm serious as both a writing instructor and writer.  the world of text messaging has been opened before me, okay, i only text one friend as of yet.  but she's funny, and keeps me on my toes.  i love that little beep beep on my phone when one has arrived.  but then i want to say so much more than i can.  it takes such time tapping those buttons.  it makes me conserve words, choose wisely, or attempt to.  the perfect writing lesson.  on other subject now...last night with eric, carolyn, cassie and jackie wilson was great!  we talked for hours.  and today i went to a bookclub who read my book -- wonderful women.  so does meeting with a writer, talking writing to a bookclub, and text messaging constitute progress in my writing chronicles?  oh oh, i DID start a story while waiting for a train (the train came at just the right moment cause driving and note-taking wasn't working well)...the title even came with it called "one missing week."  we'll see about that title and the story, but i was really getting into it.  maybe my new character idea, billy jean castle, should be in it.  puzzle pieces click together in such ways.  speaking of, i have a writing process sort of called "the puzzle."  different from randy ingermanson's "snowflake" which writers should checkout on his website ( urlLink rsingermanson.com ).  very helpful, mine is a little more messy and for less organized more puzzle-type people (will have the process on my website eventually, maybe, possibly).        assignment #1: text message someone as an exercise in writing tightly (you don't get this just anywhere folks!)  let me know how it goes.

      this has been the truth for a while and i can sustain such existence for a time and some time after that, but it's beginning to take a toll. then my neurotic side really comes out.  already i feel it in the stomach aches while i'm driving listening to music that's is mine and reminds me of all the things and places i want to discover and writing i want to do and depths to explore.  i send my girlfriend text messages of SOS.      i'm behind on reader letters too.  i can hate myself for that.  there are authors who so proudly say they never let a week pass without responding.  i so can't say that, we're talking months behind!  and it's not that i want it this way.  it's not that the letters mean nothing, because they are so meaning-full!  quite the opposite.  they're so full of meaning that i want time, thought and energy to respond.  and then i don't because time, thought and energy have been lacking.  for nearly the last 2 years.  the last 2 years have a lot in them, dark places and such.  stories from others that i still can't forget, shouldn't but they do jade you.  my own inner and outer struggles.  deadlines that nearly did me in.  and such.         i'm a whiner.  and i'm distracted cause i'm instant messaging my aunt right now and my mother-in-law just arrived with her two sisters and my son and his two friends are coming home from eating pizza and soon gotta take my daughter's friend home and get daughter to her cousin's house and i'm waiting for a phone call from a writer and his family I'm about to meet for the first time (eric wilson -- read his debute novel DARK TO MORTAL EYES  urlLink www.wilsonwriter.com ).  can't wait to talk writing.  can't wait to write.  the writing chronicles ended so quickly....

      so i need a car.   i have two, both paid off, and both beginning to break down.  one has nearly 190,000 miles.  one a jeep, the other a sporty little red thing i bought at a steal from my brother-in-law.  in a few months, i have lots of driving ahead (kids and sports at 3 locations, at least) so i need dependable and with breakdowns lately, dependable has not been here.  i start one of the cars, hoping it will.  so i need a car, just one, not two, and suddenly, i'm checking everything out.  what will be practical? gas efficient?  fun?  me?  can a car be me?  should it?  do i care about practical or efficient?  sometimes.  i do care that my kids aren't crammed and grouchy, but oh, that rx-8 is so sweet and just might be "me."  197-238 hp, 0-60 in 3-4 seconds, cool four doors that open like french doors of the future (http://www.caranddriver.com/article.asp?section_id=33&article_id=7581).  i discovered upon buying "sporty-at-a-steal", that a car actually can bring a measure of happiness.  taking those curves, stereo pounding, and zipping along (a touch over the speed limit) -- it's exhilarating.  i like that, even if i don't necessarily think i should, or that being a somewhat conservative person with an impulsive wild streak is good(i think stephen king described himself in a similar manner which makes me wonder.)   so all this car searching is consuming: suv, 2-doors, 4-doors, car payment or go cheaper and happily have no car payment (like now), V-8, straight 6, a jeep like i once had (a real jeep with big tires and hard top), sporty extravagant, mini-van conservative...my son wants me to get the 2005 Corvette that looks like a Dodge Viper, yeah, okay (he's only a few years from getting his license).  it's only a car, i tell myself.  but i'll be living and writing in that car, the other self says.  regardless of what each part of self says, i suddenly find that this has taken WAY too much thought.  i mean, i'm blogging about it.  it never ceases to amaze me how consumed with temporary things i can become.  i'm a seeker person, somewhat dissatified, sometimes lonely, often reaching for the beyond, the meaning of everything, the important and eternal, how God views it all.  then i see a shiny car and wonder, "what kind was that?"  torn between here and there.

      so the weekend exhausted me and not in a fun way.  bright note, i did find a character and named her "billy jean castle."  (wonder if i heard that name somewhere, but google turned up nothing) she's a woman in her late 40s, slightly overweight, dirty-blonde hair in braids, flip-flop shoes and cutoffs, and runs with her shoulders and head down while hands move even faster than her feet.  i loved her and will put her somewhere.    other than that: thai food tastes good (green curry dish),  the changing sunlight on water is hypnotic, someone you love getting arrested and making phone call to you at 6AM is terrible.      i need a nap, for a few days.

      so i've written six novels now and i'm still unclear as to how long it takes me to write one.  it takes until the deadline, that's how long.  i've recently finished a book and it's safely off to beloved agent where we'll look for a home for it (i'm in a publishing transition, at least, hoping it's "transitional").  seems changes are everywhere, me made to move when i don't want to, worrying sometimes, or just riding the wave.  anyway, there are several ideas i keep working on, two are pretty much experiments with possibly no marketable value -- these are currently my favorite projects to work on.  we'll see what happens there.  i need a bit of focus, maybe, but a few months of non-writing-focus sounds nice too.  with a big conference coming soon, the fog might burn off a bit.  i love fog.     but, i thought i'd try to gauge how long it takes ME to write a novel (or to complete a writing experiment) by recording it here in my shiny new blog.  i mean, it's not like i have a following or am here for any other purpose than no purpose at all...it's rather for me i think that's what Lisa Samson was trying to tell me).    so...chronicles of one writing life: --about 6 hours working on promotion, learning html code, web stuff, email and general such stuff that had nothing to do with stories (and still didn't catch me up).   --that one sentence discovered while driving and wrote down, or rather half a sentence.  i'm not putting it here, it's sleeping away for now. --a quote that moved the gray matter tonight as it has before, but maybe now towards a story, could fit with experiment #1 (titled either 3AM or clockworks -- why am i giving titles to experiments?) "the people we’ve become, well they’ve never been the people who we are." quote from a matchbox twenty song.  there's a lot there.   --returned to john gardner's  on writers and writing   for the purposes and purposeless...grace to you, and good sleep.

      I've started my own blogspot, and why would that be?  Mind you, a few months ago, I knew nothing about blogs.  David Ryan Long's ( urlLink http://faithinfiction.blogspot.com/ ) was the first I viewed, and his was so impressive the thought never occurred to do my own(and mine will be nothing like his, I'm far from that ambitious or talented).  I've no real idea why I'm doing this, or why it would mean anything, or why...hey, I bet half the blog-people say just that.  Therapy perhaps?  Buying into the reality TV generation? The need to be heard, even if no one will listen?  So the list could continue.  But my writer friend, Lisa Samson, suggested I do this -- there were reasons even.  She has a blog, another I'm much impressed by, and she's such a fabulous person that I'm reading hers all the time now.  Lisa Samson inspires me ( urlLink http://www.lisasamson.blogspot.com/ ).  And so, without reason, what the heck, diving into the deep water, here I am.  I'll misspell words, make horrid grammar mistakes, and often make no sense at all, or worse, reveal more than I should.  I won't be consistent.  Or reliable.  I won't offer the best advice.  I'm on a straight and narrow path, as best I can, but the lines sometimes are blurred, so I tend to bump around or step into potholes, often.  So that worries me.  Everything pretty much worries me lately, which then worries me more.  A friend once said, "Don't worry, don't do it" and yet, what I worried over came true.  So there.     But I'm a blogger now.  My words may be mostly fiction, I will warn you of that.  Or not.  Who knows?  I don't.  This is a work in progress, as I am.  And some progressive work is needed in me, I'll talk about that more later and hopefully more changes will occur.  For now, let me tell you, I had a great moment tonight, well, even longer than a solitary moment.  An evening with two writer friends.  We sat outside on Kimberly's patio with amazing view, ate Greek salad, sourdough bread, watermelon, drank some Chardonnay, talked about the writing life and read Cathy's chapter (she has a great reading voice).  It was rather magical.  The moon rose up as the horizon turned dark.  I could've stayed there for hours, and actually did.  So much for a moment.  But I'm grateful for it.  Thank you God for tonight.  It was needed.  Writers need one another.      My first blog.  Here you are.

      "the years only make us more of ourselves."&nbsp;   a friend turned forty.&nbsp; my son starts high school in a few weeks at my old high school.&nbsp; and&nbsp;my crash-and-burn watersport injury is over a week and half old and i still can't take a deep breath without pain in the ribs -- i used to bounce right back from such things.&nbsp;   age.&nbsp;&nbsp;and i'm okay with it.&nbsp; i like the above&nbsp;quote and find for me and hopefully many others, it's true.&nbsp;&nbsp;when you live in your hometown, people&nbsp;have known you, and you've known them forever, or so you think you know one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;some&nbsp;friends say that&nbsp;i've&nbsp;changed, changed a lot (hopefully not in a bad way).&nbsp; i don't think i've really changed, and this quote sort of defined it.&nbsp; i've only become more myself.&nbsp; a few of those glimpses are coming into light.&nbsp;&nbsp;pieces are clicking together.&nbsp;&nbsp;less&nbsp;and less of me feels the need to apologize for&nbsp;how i&nbsp;view things and what i feel compelled toward.&nbsp;&nbsp;a strength perhaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;a vision with the determined force to race toward it.&nbsp; for a while now, it's felt like much of my life was bumping around in the dark, finding familiar forms,&nbsp;fearing what i couldn't see but&nbsp;trusting the hand guiding me along (what else was there to do?).&nbsp;&nbsp;there are times god strengthens our trust in him, then we&nbsp;get back to running that race, and running it hard.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   a friend and i discussed various religions yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;there are&nbsp;issues with&nbsp;americanized christianity that are tough at times, and&nbsp;truth&nbsp;is found in all religions.&nbsp;&nbsp;but what christ offers is grace.&nbsp; free to me, but not free to him.&nbsp; grace that is also love, peace, hope, and a whole slew of other wondrous things.&nbsp; and i'll take it, every day as air to breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'll cheer and laugh and jump around a bit if we get talking much about grace.&nbsp; it's free stuff without guilt but with eternal benefits -- and god, yes god indeed to be discovered and known (as much as we earthlings can know him).&nbsp; i'm in.&nbsp; &nbsp;   a strange mistaken twist yesterday brought me, instead of the intended person, talking for an hour via phone to&nbsp;someone who had a shotgun&nbsp;beside him&nbsp;and was ready to leave this world.&nbsp; what words to say and how&nbsp;needy&nbsp;we are for&nbsp;god in such times.&nbsp; and yet, all the time too.&nbsp; and i'm just fine with being a needy person; i'm needy for air and food and blood flowing through my viens, and for a good swim like i had today.&nbsp;&nbsp;   age.&nbsp; i think i'm finally okay with it all.&nbsp; also reading "the fountainhead" by ayn rand.&nbsp;&nbsp;what a grand experience that's been so far.&nbsp; rather transforming on a multitude of levels.&nbsp; all of it is invigorating on the writing side of life.&nbsp; some story is brewing, i feel it both in my stomach and chest.&nbsp; can't wait to explore it, run with it.&nbsp;

         at our community pool, i’ve seen a couple come and go with their little baby and all the baby accessories.&nbsp; once we left at the same time, so we waved goodbye and&nbsp;i saw them pack everything into their blue SUV-thingie.&nbsp; every time&nbsp;i drive by and see that blue SUV-thingie,&nbsp;i smile thinking of them swimming with their baby and carrying more than people without babies carry when going to the pool for the afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  nearly every morning around 10AM, a guy swims with his two dogs on the other side of the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;i can’t see him very well, so can’t guess his age and&nbsp;i don’t know who he is, but i’ve come to hope he and his dogs will be there whenever&nbsp;i realize it’s that time of day.&nbsp; one dog is white and the other yellow (labs perhaps), and they love splashing and swimming around the guy – the water goes a-flying.&nbsp; he tosses a stick and they all swim out toward it as if racing and laughing together.&nbsp;&nbsp;i like that guy whoever he is; somehow he makes my day better than it was at 9:45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  i know at least three friends who work in offices and read my blog, and&nbsp;i can picture each of them in their little spaces, working on the work they do (hello, hello!).&nbsp;&nbsp;i like picturing them there; it comforts me to see them even when they’re far away or we haven’t spoken in a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  once&nbsp;i had a friend with a little photo of himself in his cubicle with pin pricks in it, he liked to throw pencils&nbsp;i guess.&nbsp; he said, “me, the target.&nbsp; but&nbsp;i don’t feel that way any more.”&nbsp; he pulled it down and tossed it away.&nbsp;&nbsp;i always meant to ask him about that, and wish i’d kept the picture – even if it was a really bad photo of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  maybe my friends in their offices are having a bad day today.&nbsp; maybe their bosses are making them crazy.&nbsp; maybe the library members, subcontractors, and authors are being demanding.&nbsp; maybe today rather stinks in their life.&nbsp; maybe that guy with his dogs has only one good half hour in the day, or maybe one day&nbsp;i won’t see him again.&nbsp; maybe my old friend feels like a target again.&nbsp; and still, somehow, both stranger and friend make my life richer just picturing them, wondering about them, praying for them, imagining their routine, thanking them for what they’ve given me, and even missing them terribly.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  my youngest son’s question keeps coming at me, “what is your greatest heart’s desire?”&nbsp;&nbsp;i can come up with some pretty good-sounding spiritual answers – and&nbsp;i even mean them.&nbsp; but then there’s my earthly answers, and self-sacrificing ones,&nbsp;the selfish, the horribly honest, and then my wonderfully honest answers, and i’ve just decided that&nbsp;i must have several hearts for all the desires within them.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  how can it possibly be this hard to live here on planet earth?&nbsp; seems the older i get, the more complicated it becomes, and the less&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;see things as black and white&nbsp;but instead understand there are many layers and depths beyond our easy glance.&nbsp; we understand better how people do the things they do, even if we don’t agree with them or ever want to walk such paths or just don't have such affinities.&nbsp; but we get it.&nbsp; we can see a hint of waywardness within ourselves or our own secret wishes and it heightens our compassion and understanding.&nbsp; maybe that’s why.&nbsp; maybe discovering deeper levels of compassion inside, desired needs&nbsp;of forgiveness, more substantial beauty in what we’d once pass on by – maybe that’s why it’s hard on ole planet earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  i don’t know.&nbsp; i’m just thinking here. &nbsp;

      "the struggle to find others with whom we can share our lives, others who give our lives texture and color and meaning, has been going on forever.   "the task of finding work to do that is fulfilling and productive and sufficient for our needs has been constant.    "the need for rest and sustenance and time apart has been never-ending.    "our hope and yearning and our desire for god, and a life lived with god, have been everlasting, from age to age."    sometimes you find the words that exactly describe your own search, and really mankind's search for the most part -- though don't we know so many who sit down and give up on it (don't we sometimes too)?  the balancing of this struggle, these needs, hopes and yearnings and searches -- this is my struggle, your too perhaps.  one complicates the other.  i strive harder for that fulfilling work and find myself lost in another area.  i discover someone who gives my life texture and then the busy life or the real world living doesn't allow for the texture and color and meaning to be.  my responsiblilities somehow harm my time with god, or my time with god is disrupted by thinking of what needs to be done.  what i yearn for isn't always what i need.  what i desire may not be for this time.  my excuses or guilt or view into the sadness of life can shadow the rest and prayer and joy.  on and on they go.       the quote comes from "a good life: benedict's guide to everyday joy" by robert benson.  even in the struggle, some guidance is most welcome.  most welcome.  a small book of hope.

      so do you imagine yourself on a reality tv show?   i love to watch them, or rather hate to be hooked and watching and watching like some crazed person (though the past few months insanity i've hardly watched tv).  today amanda tells me all about surreal world on mtv and now i want mtv to see it.     but, what about ME on a reality tv show?  not in my forward thinking plans, not on the goal list, not on the "what i hope to accomplish before death."  and yet, in my inbox is an email from a tv producer with a phone number and two email addresses and asking, "am i interested?"  now, of course, they may not be interested in me.  there's a lot to consider, a lot of things to look at for them, but still i have to ask on my side too.  am i interested?  how can i not be?  how can i?  oh my gosh, the fool i could be exposed as, and not just on local tv, not just on national tv, but on us and english tv!    this wasn't in my book marketing plan.  this could be trouble. but....  just months ago the hallmark channel considered my latest novel, "the salt garden."  cool to be considered, kind of prodded me on in a difficult time even though they decided to pass.  but that and this are very different.  very different.    guess we'll see where this goes.  advice, i need advice! more to come....

      so my neighbor said yesterday, "i've decided i'm not going to have any more bad days.  it's good days from now on."  he just decided it.  hey, isn't it mostly attitude?  i liked that.  i'm reading another great robert benson book, "a good life: benedicts guide to everyday joy."  it talks of balancing life -- prayer, work, community, and rest.  i need this book.  i need this balance.  for about two years now, i've been saying how i need to make some major changes.  i want good days, life as prayer, to swim more, and to keep the inner peace i've been feeling so strongly lately (god with his grace and love so close) even though it's been incredibly hectic.    "who yearns for good days?" that's not the right quote from the book, but i don't have the book here.  but the question is the same.  and i want good days, meaningful days that add up to a good, meaningful life.  a "well-done" life.  so maybe this book will offer a little direction.  robert benson doesn't know me, though i did get to shake his hand in atlanta and get a signed copy of the book, but his words and journey sure never fail to speak to me.      my seven-year-old cried for a half hour last night because he wanted to move back into the old house.  he feels bad for leaving the old for the new as if we've abandoned something.  i love him so.   "who yearn for good days?"  i'll get the exact quote, but i still wanted to ask.  and what will it take to have it?

      tomorrow is the 4th of july.  for my family, it's the day to remember my nephew passing from this life to the next.  brady shawn harman lived three months.    sometimes short snippets of time with people change us in the most profound ways.  they move us, shape us, help us reach beyond the moment and our own narrow view.      my son and my sister's brady were born two weeks apart.  we were excited about having babies so close together, wondered what they'd be, anticipated them starting kindergarten together in mrs. kostelec's class.  oh, the plans we make.  the days we believe to be ours.    brady was older and smaller and didn't have the health to live upon this earth.  and yet, he was loved so richly and he gave back so deeply with his smile and little grip around our fingers and a depth in his eyes that seemed beyond this place.    how can seven years have passed now?  it seems impossible.  born on easter sunday and died on independence day.    we miss you, brady.  we will see you soon.

      so i've lived with my impatience.  conquered, or so i've told god and insisted he need not test me any longer as i'm as patient as i need to be.  ah, but my patience or impatience will be tested again and again and again -- this my writer friends is what awaits each of us.  months and years and decades of waiting.  but we must persevere, the alternative is to not be a writer.     i'm again at larger waiting stage.  who wants a novel?  anyone, anyone? well not just anyone? what if no one?  am i doomed toward future publication?  and all that guidance that seemed straight from god while in atlanta feels a little hazy now.      SWM (single written manuscript) seeks good publisher who enjoys long walks on the beach, has likeminded vision and immediate love-at-first-read for a long-term commitment (maybe tens of thousands of sales, please, pretty please, it's a writers unfortunate reality -- yes, sales are very important even for those of us who wish to only be lost in the words and myth).    tested impatience brings out my oddities.  i have plenty to do, to write, to pursue.  and for over two years, i've been seeking to change my life.  i need more peace.  but how?      ah, one treasure of my recent cba convention...robert benson's new book,  urlLink A Good Life: Benedict's Guide to Everyday Joy .  focuses on our lives as a balance of prayer, community, work and rest.  i need this book, can't wait to crack it's pages and hope in my soul for some guidance.  here's the  urlLink study guide :

      i miss europe. last night, i felt like a portal opened, and i was both here and there. vivid. the smells, the feeling so clear. and then it was gone. i want to go back, but there are so many choices of where. back to austria, prague, paris, netherlands, germany, or italy? what of ireland, greece, croatia...  i miss several of my friends. two i talked to yesterday (one the phone and in person), another i'll see today, one i've meant to call for months (sorry wee), one i need to email back and have mentally composed the email several times, and another i think of often and hold conversations with even though we're very far away.  school is soon to start and i get grouchy thinking of it.  the kids gone and i'll want to do so many things.  that's when i'll miss homeschooling and our ski days and such.  but it's better this way, the way it needs to be.  i'll miss them though.   oh yeah, i decided "no" on the reality tv show. it just wouldn't have been a good idea,i think.  my writer friend, laura walker, is coming for four days. it's her writing escape, and i'm thrilled to have her work here. i get to bring her tea and discuss plots and my new wacky idea i'm working on -- we're even strong about not talking too long so she should get lots done (maybe i'll get a decent amount too?).  laura, my inaugural author to stay in my office with new comfy futon bed i bought for guests.  even have some pictures up for her -- hemingway, van gogh, dali, matchbox twenty, buechner, enger (inspiration all around).   writing: reading the fountainhead is invigorating the writing mind. last night, as i drove and felt europe around me, i discovered two major solutions on two different projects. can't wait to work on them. and the wacky idea, my writing experiment titled either 3am or clockworks -- i've set a goal to finish the first draft. have a friends who will ask about it, right? we need that, you know. another goal to finish revision on a novel i wrote two years ago, my trusty agent will ask about that.  i guess i like missing things. it fine tunes the senses, even with its element of aching and longing.  maybe missing things makes us all a little more than we'd be without it.  know what i mean?

      A creative few nights away from home, I’m staying in a house with a view of Mt. Shasta – a house that feels nearly like home for the time I’ve spent here alone and working. I’m not alone this time, my sister-in-law is here to read and relax too. Today, an unexpected rain storm with violent sheets of water from the sky – so beautiful and invigorating, and what fragrant air still remains from the open window even at this late hour.  So golly, I’m loving The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. Few books have had this affect on me – I can name a few like works by Graham Greene, Lewis, John Irving and such. It’s a behemoth of a novel with over 700 pages of tiny print. I’ve only reached over 200. Only 200 pages and I just can’t express clearly all that's it's meant.  Do you ever feel at the end of something, at the threshold of something new, yet you’re patient, expectant and feeling strong in your forward walk? It often begins with things coming round again first. The whole full circle thing. And yet, there is no going back really or coming around to the beginning because we also move onward, changed, scarred, more beautiful perhaps, weaker and stronger too.  Parts of this book are bringing into view what I’ve been catching glimpses of. And I feel an energy to walk forward even while fear must be stomped with hard steps. From the backcover summary, “This instant classic is the story of an intransigent young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who struggles to defeat him.” That my fellow book lovers is a glimpse into a book of incredible layers, character studies, views into why people do what they do or don’t do even when they want to…on and on. And now for some random quotes, and I truly mean random. My book is filled with underlined passages and notes all over those 200 pages, and I just pulled these out for no purpose at all.  QUOTE-ARAMA TIME: "He thought of his days going by, of buildings he could have been doing, should have been doing and, perhaps, never would be doing again. He watched the pain’s unsummoned appearance with a cold, detached curiosity; he said to himself: Well, here it is again. He waited to see how long it would last. It gave him a strange, hard pleasure to watch his fight against it, and he could forget that it was his own suffering; he could smile in contempt, not realizing that he smiled at his own agony. Such moments were rare. But when they came, he felt as he did in the quarry: that he had to drill through granite, that he had to drive a wedge and blast that thing within him which persisted in calling to his pity.”   (this by Roarke, the young architect talking to a potential client) “Don’t you know that most people take most things because that’s what’s given them, and they have no opinion whatever? Do you wish to be guided by what they expect you to think they think or by your own judgment?”  “You can’t force it down their throats.” “You don’t have to. You must only be patient. Because on your side you have reason – oh, I know, it’s something no one really wants to have on his side – and against you, you have just a vague, fat, blind inertia.”  well that's all for now from the mountain. nighteo or rather guten morgan from ceecee-senorita
