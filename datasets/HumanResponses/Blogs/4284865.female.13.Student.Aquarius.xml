        Many people i know have eather a dog or maby a cat, but i have a bunny. Sure my bunny can be hard to handle some times, but its so cute and small i had to get one of them. So to get on with my story; yesterday i was doing the laundry and by mistake left the dryer door open. I had just finished folding the close and and left it open. So i went up staris to go to sleep. This Morning i wake up and go back down stairs to watch some t.v. I thoght my bunny had no food left so i went to feed her. I had gone to her little room were we keep her and she wasn't there. i was very confuse becase theres like this wall fense that gose half way up, so she couldn't had jumped it. next thing i see is the wall to the side and it had a huge hole in it. That was when i relized she had chewed throw the wall!( the wall was like wooden ) I told my dad, mom, and brother what she did and we all started looking for her. She can clime stairs so my brother and mother went to look upstairs. Me and my dad stayed down stairs too look for her. It was about 2 hours after i saw the dryer door open, as i went to close it i saw her there sleeping on top of all the clean clothes. .....i just stod there in amaisment. My dad walked over to me and saw her so he begain to laughf. So i told my brother and mother where she was and the searh was over......later today my mom found the back of her couch all chewed up and all the phone cords riped. She wasn't to happy. Well thats my bunny story. :)

       Do you ever feel like the world's closing in on you and every thing starts crumbeling into small tinny peaces? Well thats basical the story of my life,.....yea i have good times and great days, but its at the end of thouse great days when u realize you have nothing to gradhold to. I just feel like somethings missing. Today was one of thouse great days, but here i am writeing this and its almost the end of my day. I think this time i may have something to grab hold to. Today i was online and a person imed me that i would never think in a million years would. it was the day befor the last day of school and me and her had gotten into a huge fight. The fight was about me and how she thought i betraid my ex by telling Jason ( one of her former friends ex ) that i like him. why shouldn't i have told her i liked him? Heck i told Jason i liked him, and only to find out that he liked me back. the next day i didn't go to school and left the problem unfinished. but heres to show that she wanted to talk tome. we both talked online and later on the phone she apoligized and so did I. Today i gained an old friend and still notice i can grasp Jason's heart. ........funny .....she tells me jason caled her and told her that he would like to go out with me sometime. .....funny how things seem to work out. ....funny how a day can start like a train reak and work its way out into one of thouse great days......well my day is over and i truly have something to grab hold of and thats my life.
