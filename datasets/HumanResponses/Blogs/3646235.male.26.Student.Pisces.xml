      We had lab meeting today, like almost every Wed.  And, like almost every lab meeting, it ran over.  Some people just don't know how to present ideas in a concise and efficient way.  Ah well.  We're trying to decide on a lab T-shirt.  Sometimes it's tough working with such a diverse group.  It's hard to get them to focus on the important things.  I still love working with interdisciplinary groups.  Word of the Day: anomalous - irregular or deviating from the norm

      Not much going on today, started 6 arrays today.  More tomorrow, we're going to get our engagement pictures!  Word of the Day: probity - honesty; high-mindedness

      Well, Alicia went to Houston this past weekend to register for more gifts for the wedding and look for her wedding shoes.  I stayed home and had a great time!  I went shopping for her birthday gifts, got my car inspected and registered, and looked into a wedding present for her.  I missed her and Ella, but it was nice not having to take Ella out or play with her.  I needed a break.  We head to Dallas next weekend for the 4th.  Going to spend it with her family (her brothers live there).  The weekend after that Ella and I head to Houston since my parents are coming in to look at rehersal dinner places.  Alicia will be at a conference.  She's out most of July with conferences and workshops.  Just me and the dog.  Ella will be spending a lot of time at daycare!  Research is going fine.  I started 6 arrays today.  When I finish them, I'll have 9 I need to grid.  Blah.  Damn cell lines are on backorder, so I may have some time where I'm not doing anything.  I hate wasting time like that.  I need to call Houston for a different cell line, but I'm nervous talking to people on the phone whom I've never met.  I need to do that this week.  Word of the Day: tenacious - persistent; stubborn

      Literally, I have a pain in my neck.  I don't know if I slept on it wrong or what, but it really hurts.  Got to fight through the pain.  One of my fears about getting sick is if I'm half-way through an experiment.  Would I come in to finish it?  Some of these experiments are expensive and I'd hate to waste the time and money by not coming in.  On the other hand, I wouldn't want to get everyone else sick either.  When someone in Alicia's lab gets sick (they're all in the basement), then everyone gets sick.  Took the morning off to take Ella to the vet.  She should be fine in a few days.  She goes nuts at the vet, she loves them!  It's so embarrasing, I bet they think I can't keep her under control.  Oh well.  Word of the day: propensity - inclination; tendency

      Well, the pooch is sick.  She has tummy troubles, and it was NOT pleasant to clean it up.  Gag reflex working overtime.  Poor Ella.  She's a yellow lab about 19 months old.  It's so funny how a dog is training for kids.  I'm a lot dirtier now than I used to be.  Puppy kisses?  Sure!  Muddy paws?  No problem!  Gotta dig something out of her mouth?  Excellent!  Seriously, I get slimed about once a day now.  I'm sure kids will be the same.  You also become more protective.  Messing with my dog?  Over my dead body!  Not feeling good, pooch?  Sympathy to the rescue!  I love that dog.  As much as she can be a pain in my ass, she's wonderful.  We really have to prioritize though.  Don't go out as much as we used to (especially when we first got her!).  Have to let the dog out.  And if she doesn't go to puppy daycare, she needs to be played with.  Dogs.  Kids.  Hmm, they should be pretty neat too.  Word of the Day: equivocal - ambiguous; open to two interpretations

      I have this great pipeline for my experiments.  Some take longer then others, so I do as many of the long ones as I can and do everything else when I get backed up.  Right now I'm waiting on cells to grow (arrive, actually!), and on slides.  Once I have slides, I can do a ton of experiments while I grow cells, then start all over.  It's important to plenty to do and to keep things moving.  I'm reading articles while I wait on everything else.  You know, sometimes (many times!) I don't think I know enough to actually get a job after this.  Can I keep the grants coming in?  Will the ideas keep flowing?  I have pretty good ideas, but no idea how to carry many of them out.  Lots of collaborations, I guess.  More on that later.  Word of the day: bantam - a small and feisty or quarrelsome person; diminutuve; tiny syn: miniature, small, petite, Lilliputian

      Awesome book.  It's about a dream this guy has.  He starts off in Purgatory (or Hell, if you never leave).  It's a grey town that grows forever.  People can have what ever they want (they keep moving to a new house to get away from their neighbors), but no one is happy.  He moves to Heaven with some Ghosts from the town and watches their story.  Each Ghost has a problem they hae hung onto from their life and they can not let go.  If they would let go and love God, they would become more solid and be able to walk to Heaven.  They were to selfish or took good things to extremes, like loving a child but not loving God.  I went and bought more books by Lewis, and I'll post my thoughts on them when I'm finished.  I really liked this version of Heaven.

      Well, I met with Father Ed this weekend.  He's in charge of our pre-marriage counselling.  It's been awesome, like I've said before.  Anyway, he and I met after our session.  He mostly talked.  Most of my questions seemed to fade away before I could ask them.  It's like when you have a debate with someone and think of all these great responses, but when you actually have the debate your points are moo.  I had several questions about things in the Bible, most importantly how can you trust everything if it was written by men?  He said that they were just stories for the most part.  Before most people were literate, the only way to pass things on was to make a story out of it.  Everything in the Bible did not neccessarily happen, but the message is what is important.  Hmmm, something to think about.  Now to think of more questions for him next time.  We'll probably meet in August, so I have plenty of time.  I really want to have a stronger faith, and maybe thats the most important thing.  Once I'm there, it won't be a half-ass endeavor.  Maybe I intentionally slow my progress so I won't have to go to church as often.  That's a sad.  More on all of this later.  Things I need to work on: Praying more Reading the Bible Going to Church

      Well, as I mentioned before, I'm getting married.  The wedding is October 2, 2004.  Let me offer some advice to those planning a wedding.  If you can get through the planning, then the worst is over.  Man it's stressful.  And I'm not even doing most of the planning.  I am in charge of the honeymoon.  That's a secret, but I gaurantee she'll love it.  Sometimes I wonder if she's quessed where we are going, and I catch myself at the last second before I spill the beans.  I'm looking forward to the wedding, then things can calm down around here.  She's also a graduate student and under a lot of stress with her research.  I don't think I'm under as much stress as her and the little I do have is sometimes hard to deal with.  Anyways, I think the wedding will be wonderful.  We're meeting with a priest this weekend, part of the requirements to get married in the Catholic church.  I highly recommend it, even if you're not Catholic (I'm not).  It has been great learning about how to communicate with your partner.  In fact, we had a talk last night.  I'm worried about the attention I get from her (me, a guy, worrying about affection!).  She gets so stressed with work that I take a backseat sometimes, which is fine, I know she has to work.  But it's the little things she can do, like run her hand through my hair when she passes by.  One of the things we're working on with Father Ed. is putting the other person first.  So, I'm trying not to let it get to me.  I'm doing a better job with it.  I get to meet (hopefully) with Father Ed alone tomorrow to talk about faith.  I haven't discussed that yet here, next week.  I'll let you know how it goes with Father Ed.  I'm currently reading C.S. Lewis "The Great Divorce".  It seems to help me make some sense of it all, but more on that later.  What's coming down the road (thing's I'll be discussing later): Crisis of faith. My hot temper. Ella.  Oh, the word of the day is: avail - to be of use or value

      I'm going to start a word of the day.  I figure, as long as I'm blogging every day (my goal), I might as well learn while I'm at it.  I don't think people strive to learn during their life like they should.  You should always strive to learn.  People walk around listening to music over their walkmans.  Does no one think anymore?  I use the time walking to plan my day, analyze data, etc.  Oh well.  Anyways, the word of the day words will most likely be familar, but you know when you use a word but don't really know the definition, that's what I'm going to post.  Today's word is audacity.  It means boldness; impertinence.  As in "I can't believe this guy is post the word of the day when his vocabulary sucks!"  I was supposed to talk about the wedding today, but I'm rushed for time.  I finished two more experiments today and entered them into the database, so I'm running ahead of schedule in the grand scheme of things, but late today, go figure.  More tomorrow (and another word!).

      Forgot to mention last time that I'll only tell the truth in these blogs.  Why keep a journal if you're just going to lie?  So, what should I tell you first?  Work?  Wedding?  Waning faith?  Let's try work.  I'm a fourth year graduate student studying Biomedical Engineering.  My research project involves a molecular analysis of cervical cancer and its progression from normal to cancer.  I use microarrays (gene chips) to study the global expression of every single gene in the human genome at the same time.  Lots of fun, until you have to enter the data into a database.  I've been doing that this week, so boring and so long.  Afterwards, I see spots when I close my eyes, tiny views of the microarray.  It's like when you play a video game like tetris or War Craft, you see the pieces moving around when you close your eyes.  I bet my mom sees cards moving from playing so much solitaire on the computer.  Anyway, I figure I have about 2 more years left of research before I graduate with a doctorate.  Yippie.  Still no idea what I want to do when I grow up.  Ah, my data has just been loaded into the database, so I'm off to look at it.  I think next time we'll talk about the wedding.

      Well, I guess I've now entered into the realm of Blogging.  Not as exciting as I thought, but we'll see.  I suppose I should let you know what I'll be talking about, if you're even interested.  I'm a graduate student and about to be married, so there's plenty to talk about there.  The wedding is October 2, 2004.  I'm excited, but more about that later.  I'll also be talking about life as a graduate student.  I'm a fourth year student with about 2 years left of research.  Lastly, I'll be talking about my struggles with faith.  That's probably why I started this in the first place.  I hear blogging helps people organize their thoughts, which is what I need if I'm ever going to get past this crisis of faith.  So, I look forward to posting my ramblings.  Don't know why people feel the need to read most of the blogs out there, so I shouldn't expect mine to be any more important that anyone else, but there is that feeling of, "hmm, maybe I'll post a famous blog someday."  Anyway, at the very least it will provide a written record of my thoughts.  Should be interesting to read 20 years from now.

      This past weekend my parents came into town to look for a rehearsal dinner place.  Alicia's dad, my dad, and I went to Sears to register for tools.  It was awesome!  I felt like such a man.  Two guys giving their experience to a younger guy so he can look after his family.  It was a rite of passage, like an Indians first hunt.  By owning power tools I am now a man.  Incredible.  I have been struggling to reason why gays should have the right to marriage.  After this weekend I have a better understanding.  If I had two moms, I would never have gone through that rite of passage for a young man, the registering of power tools.  I realize that we are all equal, but still different.  Man and woman are different, and those differences are fine, it doesn't mean they are not equal.  However, you are robbing children of valuable experiences unique to their gender by not having a mom and dad.  I still need to think about giving them some rights of married couples.  Word of the Day: succint - terse; brief; concise

      Interesting morning today.  I took Ella back in from outside and this man downstairs was kind of crying out and had trouble opening his door.  I put Ella inside and ran back down to see what the problem was.  He said his leg was hurting and he wanted to go inside to sit in his chair.  I helped walk him to his chair and he sat down, he said his leg felt like it was asleep.  He said if it got worse he would call for an ambulence.  I really should have called or done something else.  I made sure he was comfortable, he seemed to relax once he was in his chair.  Maybe I'll check on him later today.  Wow, I really felt helpless.  Word of the Day: expurgate - to remove erroneous, vulgar, obscene, or other objectionable material before publication

      I had some fillings replaced at the dentist today, my jaw is sore.  I was REALLY nervous during the procedure.  It was uncomfortable, but no pain.  Don't know why I was so worried.  I'm adding Drano to my fiancee's tub, she'll be surprised!  Man, she looses a lot of hair in the tub!  Wookie!  She left me a "Honey To Do" list (drano wasn't on it).  I don't mind doing things for her, as long as she makes it like I took it upon myself to do something for her, not a list of things I HAVE to do for her.  Started an organotypic culture today.  Instead of growing cells in 2D, we're growing them in a 3D matrix that will look more like in vivo tissue.  Pretty cool.  The cells are in a collagen matrix, so it looks like jello.  Man, I'm going to write more on "deep" topics, but I don't feel like it.  My jaw hurts.  Word of the Day: unfettered - free; unrestrained

      Went to Dallas for the 4th and had a great time.  Ella played with Tyson and Bruiser in the yard, but you can tell she likes to play inside better.  She whines at the door when she's hot and wants to play with people.  Alicia is away at a conference this week.  She gets back next Monday.  I really hate going home to an empty apartment.  I stay at her place most of the evening to watch tv but mainly to stay close to her presence.  She left am a list of things to do while she's gone, I'll probably finish most of it tonight.  I also really need to bathe Ella, she's filthy and scratching a lot.  I'll probably take her to Petsmart and get a bone for her after her bath.  My parents are coming to Houston this weekend (Thurs, actually).  I can't wait to see them!  They're coming to pick out a rehersal dinner spot.  Word of the Day: decimate - to reduce drastically; to destroy a large part of

      Let's not get into extreme fanaticism, but moderate fanaticism in faith.  Do you have to be fanatic about God to have faith?  Can you have a quiet understanding with God?  It seems all the people I know that have a strong faith are almost extreme.  That's all they can talk about and they are rigid in their beliefs.  Well, not everyone.  John has a strong faith and I don't see that in him.  Maybe the people I think don't have a strong faith actually do, they just don't talk about it.  How strong is my parent's faith?

      Well, some of the guys in lab went to see Farenheit 9/11.  I hate talking politics in lab, half us are conservative, the other liberal.  I'm conservative.  Let's clear up one point for the record.  The policies that are in place right now are due to the last President.  The economy is in the craper you say?  Well that's because of the previous administration's policies.  It takes years for a bill to finally pass and start affecting the nation.  By that time, a new President is in office.  Don't blame Bush for Clinton's mistakes!  History will judge Bush in the end, and I believe it will look at him in a positive light.  I think next time we'll talk about geopolitics.  Word of the Day: quiescence (quiescent) - inactivity; stillness
