       Wow, I wish I wasn't so ADD that I could keep a diary or write a poem right now.  I think I shall try though.

        I went out with a friend tonight and we just drove until it was time for the last showing of Little Black Book, which is okay if I might add.  But we were driving around and I was remeniscing about times back in high school and immediately after.  Mostly about an old friend, Jeff.  It just so happens that Jeff was my first kiss...and we drove by the spot where it happened, places he used to take me...stuff like that.  I've been thinking about it and I've realized that I've been doing that a lot lately...remeniscing that is.  It's weird...in some ways I wish I could go back.  Back before everything caved in...before everyone turned their backs.  But at the same time, I want to be who I am now.        There's so much of me that's just waiting to be realeased.   It's like there's this person inside of me just waiting for the right time to jump out and make good with all these talents.   I hate arrogance, and part of me is howling and scratching my eyes out while I type this, but I know I'm here for a reason.  A big reason in some way.  And every day, it's like this fire inside me grows, and I'm ready to burst at the seams.  But every time I try to let it out...to harness all of it and release it the way I'm supposed to, I get a little trickle, then I close up again.  It's like my social studies teacher used to tell my mom when I'd get in trouble.  "Mrs. Young...the light was off again today."  It's like I'll have this moment where I'll open up, and I'll be everything I can...what I'm supposed to be, but then the doors will slam shut and I'm back to playing a role.  I feel like a child in so many ways....being that there is so much I want to do, and I'm just staring at the world doe-eyed and in awe.  Then there's the weathered, cynical adult in me trying to surpress all those dreams to save myself the pain.  So which is better...to be a dreamer....and always have that to reach for, or to settle for what you think is the best you can do?   I want to be a painter, a writer, a poet, a singer, an architect, a doctor, a geneticist.....the list goes on and on....and I know there's no limit to what I CAN be, because I was blessed with the mind I have.  But that blessing also brings curses with it.  There are times I can't turn my mind off....that I can't just STOP looking for the solution and just live.  It's such a double-edged sword.  I say in jest that I would like a lobotomy.  While most of it is just pure ironic humor, there are parts of me that actually feel this way.  Ignorance is bliss.  If I didn't know that I could do so much more, I wouldn't be so unhappy that I'm not there yet, right?  But then there's that piece of me that I've grown to love...the piece that makes me the fighter...that tells me I'm going to get there someday.  Someday I will find my release...and it will all fit together like a puzzle...and I'll be the poet....the artist...the lover....the mother....everything I dream of being....as long as I keep the faith that it will.      I've toyed with thoughts of writing a book...about my struggles...to help people that are going through something similar.  The same with speaking publicly.  I would LOVE to just give someone who's down where I was the hope to keep going, but I don't know where to start.  It's so overwhelming when I start thinking about it that I shoot myself down before I even try.  Yes, I know I shouldn't live my life based on fear, and that I need to just grab the bull by the horns, but lifelong habits are hard to break.  My bane is the constant thoughts of how I can mess up.  How I might not reach that one person...and they won't be able to find a reason to hang on.        I know I can't be perfect, and I don't want to be...but knowing that there is no limit to what I can achieve has put a weight on my back while I'm trying to climb my ladder.  And at the end of the day, it's a weight that I'm both glad to bear, and wishing to be free of.

        If you haven't noticed, I'm a Dashboard Confessional fan.  You will probably hear a lot about them in this blog.      My name's Shana, I'm 24 (soon to be 25) and from upstate NY.  I'm a student, poet, dreamer, romantic, artist, psycho, dork....  I'm sure there's a lot more that I could add.  I have a panic disorder and depression, and I'm very open about it.  I know how much people that weren't afraid to say that they suffer from a mental illness helped me, so I will never hide that part of who I am.  I'm always looking for cool people to talk to, so don't be afraid to im me.  I like making new friends.  hehe      I don't have much time right now, so I'll save the "emotional" posts for later.  (Expect a ton...I'm big on sharing my feelings.)
