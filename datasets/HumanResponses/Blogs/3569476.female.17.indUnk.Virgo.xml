      What the hell is my problem?! Okay so I leave for camp tomorrow and I'm going mental. I love camp, it's been my home away from home for going on nine years and now suddenly I don't wanna leave. And it's all because of one thing... my amazing friends.  I know camp is gonna be the same amazing experience that I have every year. The kids are gonna be awesome and the counselors are gonna be a blast but I can't help thinking how much I want my friends to be with me there. To experience the campfire and the just awesome-ness that is camp. Augh, but I know they can't and it makes me want to cry. I've never been this close to so many people before; it's frightening. I think that's why I've never be homesick before, not a little, not at all. I never really had anyone to miss before.  Now, don't get me wrong. I'm excited for camp but I've gotta face the fact that I don't know any of the JCs or CITs (hardly) and I know things about my friends that no one else does. Four weeks is a long time. It's a long time to be away from Sobe, Kay, Page and Potts, Nemo and Hanus and even Kopetsky. I'm gonna miss them all in their own little ways.  Auhhh, four weeks. How can I go without my friends for four weeks?

      Today was freakin' awesome. I can't even believe it happened. Well it didn't start out so good, the ACT's blew somethin' major, but right after that I coolified myself and went to watch some of the best friends I have graduate from High School. Of all of 'em I'm gonna miss my Page the most. There was a strange feeling in the air so that even when I wanted to cry, I couldn't. I guess which is for the best, but still...  Anyway, after the Ceremony it was off to Page's. I met her family. Her sister was extremely pretty and had amazing taste in shoes and her brother was so awesome. We kept trying to get him to sit with us but he turned us down each time. Oh well, he was awesome anyway. Potts, Hanus, Reithel, and Matt all made appearances and so did Brooks and Starkey. Lemme just say fun was had by all.  One finally thought for my Senior friends: "I'm gonna miss the hell outta you so you better stay in touch forever!" I love you all and I'll miss you.   For everyone else: "CLASS OF '05 KICKS ASS!!!"

        These are the Good Old Days    These days nostalgia is lost on me I live for now instead of what will be Too happy to look back on yesterday I wish we could stay forever this way Such beautiful moments go by too fast Seconds, minutes and hours slip past Until all are gone; the day will end Knowing tomorrow you'll still be my friend Together up to the stars we gaze Singing, "These are the good old days"  When I'm with you I'm never judged I'm beside you when my makeups smudged My hairs in a mess and my jeans are torn Others look at me to frown and scorn But you stand by and hold my hand I can always count on you to understand But the sand keeps falling in the hour glass And what is now, too soon will pass Years will speed by, leaving us in a daze But we'll be singing, "These are the good old days"  The time of our parting draws on apace So I'll smile with you and save your place Forever if need be until you come home From wherever it is you've chosen to roam And though these tears may fall from my eyes I always knew we'd have to say our goodbyes I have no regrets though it hurts me so To look back on so long ago So one last time, under the sun's warm rays, We'll be singing, "These are the good old days"   Page, I love you! I'll miss not have you at school. Don't cry, we still have forever...

      Today was a sad day for me. Yeah, I know, last day of school sorta I should be happy. Well, I'm not. This last semester kicked me in the ass and I don't know how to recover. I feel my brain shutting off for the summer and I'm like no, no, not yet!!! Plus because of slacking this semester I have to go to ALL of my exams. This sucks so much. Also it was the last day of school for the Seniors. Damn how I'm gonna miss them. It really isn't gonna be as fun next year w/o them. I'll miss you guys. MUAH!

      Well, camp is over, I'm done apartment watching and Seton Fest is over and done with. NOW WHAT DO I DO?! I am so freaking bored. Maybe camp spoiled me because I was used to all this action but now I'm just bored out of my mind. Somebody call me so we can do something, ANYTHING. I guess I should look on the bright side; it's still better than being stuck in school.  By the way did you know that Amanda is said more than petroleum? Yeah, I'm BORED! but check out http://www.fabrica.it/wordcount/main.php. It's pretty cool.

      Let me tell you a little story. So I invited Sobic to my churches festival, Seton Funfest. Her reply; "Oh, I've seen those signs around and I made funny of them. I thought it was Satan Funfest." She comes despite the hilarious name mix-up.  	Funfest was starting to drag after we bingoed our butts off and won nothing, ate food, and scan for hot guys but got no return looks. The search for boys was fun despite its massive failure. We were the hunters searching for prey. Hell, we even made up hand signals. They were pretty simple as far hand signals go. We just held up the number of fingers as there were hot guys. Example: two hot guys, two fingers. We had plenty of sightings.  One of our firsts was a redhead standing by the napkins. We walked around some more and came back. He was still there by the napkins so were go and watch the band at the tent he walks from his napkin spot over to us and... just stands there. He lingers for a minute and turns back to his napkins. Weird. 	Then we ditch Funfest for the ever exciting Omega and get some ice cream. "This seems to be a vicious cycle," Sobe says. "We look for boys; we can't get boys, so we eat ice cream." Subsequently, we go to Wal-Mart to see if Hanus is working, but we can't find him so we go to Target. It was 9:54pm and Target closes at 10:00pm. I walked up to the door and waited for it to automatically open. "What the hell?" I shout, "I still have six minutes." Then I make a very important observation: the door was not automatic. Ops. We walk in and I grab the Notebook, which an awesome movie but I hear the book is ten million times better.  	Anyway, we leave but we still have an hour to kill so we do what pretty much any teenager has done or will do; we go cruising. After about a half hour of cruising we decide enough's enough and we head home. We're going down Grange but we want to go through the new round-a-bout they have just put in. "Lets just go around and around," I say. So the windows are down, our music is playing and Sobe and I are in my PT Cruiser going around and around. Suddenly, Sobic says to me, "Um Brown. There's a cop." 	"Oh, Shit," I say and quickly exit the round-a-bout, police car follows with its light blinking. "Uh, does he want me to pull over?" 	"Yeah, I think he does." I turn of the music and pull the car to the side of the road.  	It seems to take him forever to get out of the car and come to the window but he does and he has his little flashlight and is shinning it in our eyes. "Hello Ladies," he says, "Are you lost?" 	"No." We shake our heads. 	"Oh, you just don't know how the round-a-bout works then?"      	"Um, no. We know," Sobic replies. 	"We just being silly and going around some," I smile sheepishly with my hands clutching the steering wheel. 	"Do you have a license?" He says to me. 	"Uh, yeah. Right here," I say handing it to him. 	"Okay, I'll be right back. Wait here." 	We wait as he walks back to his car. As soon a he closes the door, I freak out. "Oh my god, Sobe! I'm going to get a ticket; my mom is going to kill me." Sobe just holds up one of her fingers, the signal for a lone "hottie." "I can't believe you!" I shout, pause, "Yeah, okay. He seems pretty cool, too." Hot Cop comes back with his little flashlight. He hands me back my license. 	"You Ladies didn't do anything wrong," he says, "I was just wondering what the hell you were doing. It looked so weird to see you just going around and around." 	"Okay Officer, we won't do it again," Sobic says and we go home laughing the entire way. Oh man, I can't believe that happened. My very first pull over and it was the funniest thing EVER!

      Well I'm back and I can say that my fears were completely unfounded. I've never had so much fun. It was the best ever and I guess that how it should be. What could be my last year should always be the best. I can't deal with that thought though. That that could have been my last year. I don't even know what to say. I need sometime to think. I miss it so much. I wish I was at camp. I wish I was home...

      Each year I write a letter to Jared, my friend who passed away two years ago today. Then, just before midnight, I take that letter and a candle out into my backyard. Under the stars I set the letter to flame and watch as the smoke goes up to heaven and up to him. That used to be an ancient way of sacrifice but for me it's a release of pain. It's the only time of year I can put my thoughts about Jared together cohesively. It gives me, what feels like, a few minutes back with him. I've written three letters total, one a week after he died, one year after and today, two year later. I've saved the last two as a memory but the first one is gone. That is a time I would like to forget.  I still can't believe it's been two years when I can't believe it even happened at all. I'm still stunned to silence. To put it simply, I miss him. Jared, I miss you and can say with much certainty that so does everyone else. We won't forget you and please know that we love you, Jared. We love you...

      So the other day I found one of my Old Chicken Soups for the Teenage Soul books (#2 to be exact) and I read a list entitled "What I Wish I'd Known Sooner." So I decide to make my own list. Feel free to comment on anything you think I should add. Here goes:  WHAT I WISH I'D KNOWN SOONER •	Friendships are like fire, they can't keep going without help. •	Don't let your life wait for other people.  •	Going around a round-a-bout is okay as long as you limit the number of times to one. •	Sometimes smart people can do very, VERY stupid things.  •	You can still think a cop is cute even if he's about to give you a ticket. •	Do what your heart tells you, even if others tell you differently. •	Never, ever, EVER let a member of the opposite sex make you compromise your standards. Never. •	It's never too late to say you're sorry. •	Don't wish for things that you're not willing to go out and make come true. •	If someone tells you that you'd make a cute strawberry blonde, don't dye your hair strawberry blonde. That’s a color you have to be born with to look good.  •	Never pre-judge because you'll be wrong. •	Never stay out way past your curfew. Your parents WILL find out and you WILL be grounded. •	You never know when you're making a memory. •	Work hard at whatever you do and you won't be disappointed. •	Accept the bad things that happen to you because it's true that good comes out of everything. •	Don't take the ACT twice if you already have a good score in the first place. •	Crying doesn't change things; it just feels good. •	Laugh at the stupid things you do and you can do no wrong. •	Being nice to people will get you far. •	Notes passed in the middle of Spanish will be intercepted by the teacher and be read to the whole class. Whether it was written in Spanish or not. •     Death is not the end. •	Friends are important but not as important as your own self-worth. •	Just because someone flirts with you incessantly doesn't necessarily mean he or she likes you. •	Don't do nice things for people so you get something in return. Just do it to be nice. •	Never turn down an opportunity. You'll kick yourself for it later. •	A base tan will not prevent you from getting sunburned. Really. •	Someday you will look back on this and it will all seem funny.

						   Every time I see the midnight sky, And the crescent moon shinning high above me, With the stars shimmering their precious light, Whenever the day becomes the night, I'll think of you.  Every time I close my eyes, And slowly, gently drift off to sleep, With lights flashing inside my head, Whenever I'm alone in my bed, I'll dream of you.  Every time I see lovers pass my way, And I wish I had a lover to call my own, With the way they look into each others eyes, Whenever someone cries, I'll remember you.  Every time I hear a love song, And the melody makes me sing, With the notes dancing along, Whenever I sing a song, I'll sing for you.  I'll think of you.

						   You broke my heart, you made me cry, Without even giving me a try. You judged by how I looked, Just like I was some old book, And I was wrong I should have guessed, Why wouldn't you be like all the rest? But now you ask me if I would Go out with you, I don't think I should.  Because yesterday isn't that far away, You didn't like me then, then why today. So forget about now, let's think about then, And if I've changed please tell me when.  My hair is long, my teeth are straight, And now you're asking me for a date. Who I am still hasn't changed. Just my looks, isn't that strange, That your mind changed when I'd Changed my outside, not inside. I'm looking for someone who loves The me that was given from above.  Because yesterday isn't that far away, You didn't like me then, then why today. So forget about now, let's think about then, And if I've changed please tell me when.  I thought you were honest Thought you were caring Thought you were everything I wanted. But, oh no, I was wrong. I should have known it all along.  Beauty is just skin deep, It's the heart you got to keep. But if you look into my eyes, You'll see their owner's gotten wise, And you'll see what you did wrong. There's no more trying to belong.

						   I look into this distorted glass A cruel image comes back to me And it breaks me more than I do it When I see the face I hate to see  But now I'm caught inside that glass Trapped with the spirits of dignity And the ghosts of my self-esteem Can I live in anonymity?  Or must I face the world this way? Must I stay and face rejection Or can I just stare into the broken glass At my reflections of imperfection.

						   My heart, it was so lonely I thought it would beat for him only Thought the storm would never fade away Looking to the times of yesterday All hope was nearly lost No getting through no matter the cost Then like a rainbow through the clouds Spoke to me the most heavenly of sounds My soul you lifted Made me feel gifted Restored my hope and love You were sent from above Baby, you chased my clouds away And opened the sky for a bright new day With you by my side I can touch the sky Kissing all my worries and fears goodbye

						   In daylight we are children holding our mothers' hands In nighttime we are Bohiemiens traveling in our gypsy band The day can get so boring, of school we often tire While waiting for the night to come so we can dance beside the fire With rings on our fingers and bells on our toes We sing to the moon where ever she goes The violin plays quickly by the fire's light The wise owl takes in the sight Of our scarves waving through the air As we stick flowers in our hair By day we sit patiently waiting for the night And when the sun begins to fade we're gypsies by twilight

						   Gentle kisses reach my lips no longer Tender touches feel my skin no more My heart is aching for you to be with me I cannot hide this feeling anymore It hurts me thinking of my life without you My world is falling, crashing to the ground Thunder rolls as I wait for you in vain It's clear to me now you're no longer mine Sweet whispers find my ear no longer Silent love enters my heart no more How... can this be? I loved you... and you loved me I lie in bed each night calling out your name I wake every morning reaching for you I live each day wishing you were here I want... gentle kisses, tender touches, sweet whispers and silent "I love you's"

						   Sweet dreams, Good night Whisper softly, "Put out the light" 	Warm lips, Love erased Fade away, Warmth's replaced 	Cold ice, Visions gone And its hours until the dawn 	Red roses, Candle stick Melt away, Burnt out the wick 	Salty tears, Broken glass The love we had is lost, Collapse 	Pained screams, Star watch Fall away, Drunk half the scotch 	Bruised cheek, Kisses sweet Lost words when fist and face meet 	Sadistic devotion, Amorous hate Waste away, but it's too late.

						   I don't believe in love, It's fairy tale that never comes true. I don't believe in love, Because love never follows through.  Please tell me why I should believe a lie I don't believe in love. Love is just an illusion Confusion and delusion I don't believe in love  I don't believe in love, It's a story to help you sleep at night. I don't believe in love It's both a legend and a painful plight  Please tell me why I should believe a lie I don't believe in love. Love is just an illusion Confusion and delusion I don't believe in love  I don't believe in love In the end it always makes you cry I don't believe in love When he leaves me with Good-bye

						   It's been many years now, locked in this prison of a home A hell with bay windows and patio doors I've watch as the wishes of those I love whither at your feet. I've seen my desires sacrificed for your own petty needs You destroyed my life, my dreams and hopes of someday Breaking free and moving into the light beyond your shadow You made the mistake of loosening my leash And once I've tasted the light there's no living without I may be just a broken down spirit, cold and dark inside like you But I can still cut you and I've got the salt to make it sting You hang your lies over my head by the tiniest thread What will you do when your lies come crashing down? All around you; a life's work of pain and deceit, shattered glass at your feet What would you do if they found out who you were inside? Just a selfish brat, caring about nothing unless it's yourself When you look in the mirror do you see what I do? A monster behind a mask, choking on smoke I block my ears to your words, they burn anyway I'll leave you with your misery that you've created So carefully around yourself, trapping you inside I'm going from the darkness to bathe in the warmth of the sun.

						   You pass me by, you see me stare Your eyes see a hate that isn't there. You're walking to your gallows Alone Afraid You're walking to your gallows A man Unmade  All around you, this world is dust Just empty words, lies and mistrust You've tried once but it's all in vain All you want is to end the pain  You move by without a glace Nothing here is left to chance. You're walking to your gallows Tired Worn You're walking to your gallows A man Unborn  Each day is darker than the last Your futures slipping into the past Your heart can't take much more of this You're clinging to what's left of bliss  You go by without lifting your head You go to end your life instead. You're walking to your gallows Wounded One You're walking to your gallows A man Undone  Oh, Jared, don't you see? You're walking to your gallows You're leaving me.

						   I walk along the fading line, Between reality and dreams. Now this edge is in decline, And nothings as it seems.  Where illusions feel so certain, And reality seems pretend. I'm caught behind a curtain, When the line begins to blend.  They tell me to trust my dreams, One day they might come true. But when I pull apart the seams, The fantasies begin to skew.  These delusions start spread, And the limits keep on fading. Steadily taking over my head, As the distortion is pervading.  Any mark has disappeared. It's gone without a trace, And the line has been smeared. There's empty in its place.  I walk along the fading line, Between reality and dreams. Now I'm looking for a sign, For nothings as it seems.

						   When I was a child I never was told This world was so wild, unruly and cold But tragedy never collided this close to my heart Until Jared decided to tear my life apart Its something that comes to all but me Until I heard the drums of my destiny The light of his candle had been blown away A death I couldn't handle so I started to pray, "God, help the people who've wandered afar For they are the people whom hate did scar."  I've reached the conclusion There's no more delusions So start the confusion From this moment on I'm disillusioned...  When I was naïve, people always said Never deceive the one that you wed What a group of liars they turned out to be Full of impious desires and hypocrisy Marriage is holy or so I've heard But now love is only a fake silly word Parents tear apart the kids they betray So with a broken heart, I started to pray, "God, help the lost children. They cry for a guide. These are the children for whom your son died."  I've reached the conclusion There's no more delusions So start the confusion From this moment on I'm disillusioned...  When I was little I was made to believe You never belittle what others achieve. The worlds at peace and people understand That we all need a piece to survive in this land Racism is dead and Hate's just a word I would lie in my bed and never had stirred Until somebody tore my calm world away I could not ignore so I started to pray, "God, help humanity. Your people are crying Please, end the insanity. Poor people are dying"  I've reached the conclusion There's no more delusions So start the confusion From this moment on I'm disillusioned...

						   I walk these cold streets These streets I've walked with you What's left is a memory Of dirty alleys and a dismal view Somehow it looks so different From the road I've walked before It's just how I remember Except you're not with me anymore  I struggle to see the stars Through the billowing clouds of haze You gave the stars their fire The same way you set my heart ablaze It seems like only minutes Since your candle's been blown out Leaving me in wanting And now I must live on without  Without you I still see you Locking me in your embrace Always the romantic one With a tragically handsome face Now I'm left in wonder Marveling at love and life and death How life ends so quickly But love continues without a breath  What is left; I bring along A memory of love without a frame It's just a jaded portrait Of a tender face without a name

						   I wake from a dream. You know those dreams that leave you slowly But you always wish they never ended. My dreams are like that, As quiet and soft as a breath, But as powerful and wild as a thunderstorm. Like a gentle kiss on the cheek, It makes its impression and then leaves. It leaves you grasping on to it, begging it to stay, But it cannot. Such is the way of things That dreams do come and go in rhythm. If that rhythm ever vanished, What would become of reality? Cold and harsh, It is reality that forces the dream from our minds. For in the dream, the images from the mind seem real, But they dissolve, and physical existence is there. The night holds enough mystery, love, Adventure and horror to last a lifetime, But it disappears and we must move on.

						   You smile across the room and I know that I love you But you don't smile at me; I know I cannot have you What a merciless torment; when I see you everyday Wanting to touch you, to love you in every way A million and one scenarios, dancing through my mind Of your lips; a tender kiss, our hearts and souls entwined But each glance is like heartbreak, when you look but never see The love my heart holds for you, the wreck you've made of me Against all reason and right judgment, I'm sure I love just you And it tears me up inside because now I know I cannot have you  So leave me to wallow in all the pain you've made And I will just continue on and live this masquerade I really need to wash away, all these fantasies and dreams Because what lies beneath the surface is never what it seems In some ways I've always known, you were out of reach But there's something about my heart I could never teach And you'll never know, the passion and love that you missed The devotion that I've felt for you, an infatuation I can't resist It seemed so easy at first; without you I still loved you But it's so complicated now; I know I cannot have you

						   Do you see what your eyes cannot? My heart speaks the words, my lips do not. I buried these feelings deep down inside, Except in your eyes, for I cannot hide.  I used to think that love was tears. You give your all, then it disappears, But when I'm with you I am shown, Life isn't worth living, when living alone.  I used to see the world in black. I'd cry for all the things I lack. I've left behind the pain and guilt, Tearing down these walls I've built.  I used to hide my face from light. I lived in a world of endless night, But there are no shadows on the sun. Eventually the sun and moon are one.  I used to be an empty shell, Wishing things I cannot tell. I try to hide but you still see, The feelings deep inside of me.  Do you see what your eyes cannot? My heart speaks the words, my lips do not.

						   She doesn't know what she does to him This devil with an angelic face She teases him and tempts him With hints of her velvet and lace Since the very first day he saw her His heart unfurled before her feet Little, now, did this boy know Her world was littered with deceit  She'd been broken many times before By all the men in her life She was never the kind of girl He could take to be his wife Despite all this he continued on And willingly she fell for him Always moving with the tide Giving her heart and soul at whim She didn't mean to hurt him He knew it would come to this As much as he tried to keep her She left him with a kiss With her gone he moved on Trying not to place the blame Of his passionate love gone wrong On her heart he couldn't tame Soon she didn't remember him Her long forgotten toy He was just a victim of her game Of breaking the boy.

						   I blow out a candle I lit it for you I watch the smoke rising And wind my fingers through Its beauty strikes me It breaks my heart in two I remember your face I think of the candle as you And the flame is your life Which out yourself you blew As I watch that smoke ascend I feel like I am with you The smoke of the candle Will meet with you too...

						   I lie in our bed and wait for the dawn I haven't be the same since you've gone My hand reaches out to touch your face But your not there; it's just empty space I cry and I wonder with a weary heart Do you think of me when we're apart? I want to say I hate you and I do But it's leveled by my love for you  Wish I could say I'm battered and bruised That I was rejected, neglected and used But I can't; it's not true I'll still be in love with you Wish I could say I'm better without you here That I lived in misery, desolation, and fear But I can't; what can I do? I just want to get over you  I walk alone beneath the pouring rain You've gone and left me with this pain I feel exposed when you're not around But when you're here my loves profound  My clothes are wet; they're soaking though I want to know if I'll survive without you I want to say I'm glad that you left me But I still love you; why can't you see?  Wish I could say you've cheated and lied That you've been deceitful; that you denied But I can't; I always knew I was born to love just you Wish I could say since you left I haven't cried But the truth is that without you I die inside Oh yes; it's so true I'll always be in love with you

						   Why can't I just break though your walls? And find out who you really are. I wish you would give me one chance, But you always said I wish too much. If only you would you take the time To drop those lies and let me see. You've got me twisted but I don't why. You're messing with my head So I can't even trust myself anymore. Please just tell me how you feel. Though we may be holding hands, I'm still left a distance from you heart. Sometimes I think you say those lies So much you started believing them too. What if I turned the tables on you? Would you be able to stay away? I wonder if you know that you’re my life, And without you I wither and die. When we talk I feel like I'm drowning. Before I can get a breath, The wave crashes down again. Only you can save me now. Even a few words will suffice Please just tell me how you feel.

						   Like an echo from my past  You step through the door Oh so eager to start again To turn me into your whore It's all been done before, This emotional beating That's just the game you like  To play; of history repeating  I've broken free from you before By loosing your hold And even in doing so The thought has made me cold I had learned to live with you When all happiness is fleeting And now your back to your Old game; of history repeating  But now it's time to break the cycle This cycle that’s breaking my heart But now I see that the only time I'm happy Is whenever we're apart Because I'm sick of all the shit you pull All the lying, threats and cheating It looks like I won your Stupid game; of history repeating

						   I'm so sick of us being like this You feel nothing unless we kiss You just stand there and bite your lip What the hell is wrong with our relationship? Screw the rhymes Tetrameters bore me I 'm just going tell you the truth Because I'm tired of being someone else I'm tired of lying to myself And sorry for lying to you The truth is I hate red roses And to me violets seem purple Isn't that why they call them violets And as for sugar; it's not always sweet Like me I like to play dress up once-in-awhile But these heels are killing me And I never sit right in a skirt While I'm at it I might as well  Come clean I use unscented soup in the shower Who likes the smell of papaya and kiwi anyway? If it was up to me I’d cut my nails short And throw out the polish It's a pain in the ass to paint over chips I guess you could call me humble Because I'd rather be outside Than in the mall And I'm not the type of girl, who crushes on every guy But you're special I've never been the romantic type But since I've met you Love songs make sense And I must admit; as embarrassing as it is Each night I spray your brand of cologne  On my pillow Because it reminds me of you So look at me without the make-up And my hair part wavy; part straight Can you love me as I am? I know it's unfair To you and to me For me to continue with this stupid façade I know that I love you So I'm leaving the decision to you Love me or break me I know myself well enough to take the news And continue on No matter what the answer

						   It's Graduation day today When summer ends you'll be on your way It's hard to believe it's gone so fast And all of our memories fall into the past It amazes me to think of next year Going to classes without having you near Things won't be the same without you around And I can't let go of the friendship I've found  So laugh with me; don't say goodbye Let's stop searching for answers to why Time moves slow when it should go fast But speeds so quickly to the day I'll see you last Could we have just one more year? Perhaps we could stay forever here Because the future is blurry; it scares me to see What life has in store for you and for me  So hit the breaks for a moment; ease up off the gas Because I don't wanna spend life looking to the past Let's wait for a moment and take it all in If we can't then this is a race I don't want to win I've got all I need with you at my side So slow down a little; let's try to decide  How we can stretch these moments on And try to stop the approaching dawn  But in the end; life goes on And one of these days I know you'll be gone All I can say is, on that day When you leave me to find your way On your own; wherever you roam I hope you always find your way home And there I'll be waiting for you, my friend Just because we're apart doesn't mean this has to end.  For the Graduating Seniors

						   One tear falls; I wipe away before they see Before they get the chance to see the weakness inside of me Because of my pride it is so difficult to reveal It's so hard to show anyone, how I really feel  The heart in my chest may be breaking in two But you won't ever see me shed a tear or cry in front of you  So I'll bury my feelings deep down inside again They could resurface but I don't know where or when  I am scared of nothing but I always feel afraid And from their critical eyes, I am trying to evade Keeping what lies within me right where it belongs Speaking to no one of my sad and lovely songs  I wanted to feel nothing and this wish is coming true That's what happens when I try to hide myself away from you I guess should feel sadder, now that I am turning numb But when offered a life unfeeling, it's so easy to succumb  The pain is gone away now but the joy has left me too I move about like a shadow with my vision all askew This isn't what I wanted if I could I would feel fear But I can't so what I'll shed for you is one small, simple tear.

						   Midnight soft is how I love you Like a secret in the night Moonlight sweet is how I need you Whether it be wrong or right  When it's dark outside I hold you And I'm not ashamed to say That my heart's longing to touch you But so quickly comes the day And as quickly you are gone When my sky turns pale and light We are never the same at dawn As we were that very night  With night time comes my dreams And I suppose that's what you are But underneath the moonbeams I know you're never far Still when day comes you leave And I die a little inside The sun and I are left to grieve For the moon's love will not bide  On your violin, I watch you play A tune of love untold But with sunrise comes the day And soon the song turns cold Then all day I lie in waiting For the sun to fade from view And as the sunlight starts abating I make my way to you  Now I've had a revelation One day I'll let you see It's not my imagination Or a school girl's fantasy One night I will reveal A love you've never known I'll prove that what I feel is real And stop loving on my own  Midnight soft is how I love you Whether it be day or night Moonlight sweet is how I need you In darkness or the light.

						   Each night I look up to the sky And see the Lord in every star But for some reason, I know not why I find him not in the moon afar I see a face but he looks cold Up in space the time he bides Near the ocean rocks so old Ever changing with the tides God, for me, does not waver Like the moon does every night To me, God is my bless'd savior An always constant shinning light But, somehow, it's different now The closest star seems distant And though the sun will not allow My moon turns to a crescent I move quickly against the waves Others come but I must go Past all the people the Lord saves If I'm one the sun will show Its futile whispering prayers to the moon The man speaks not to me For the night is gone too soon And then the moon must flee I realize I am like that sphere So weary, dark and low And only when the sun is near Am I allowed to glow I revolve around the earth As the earth goes round the sun From the moment of my birth And until my life is done I'm not afraid of the sea anymore With the current I am intune As I wonder, on this distant shore, About God, the ocean and the moon

						   Childhood friendships dwindle away so fast Caught beneath the dead hand of the past  It fades like the photos on our shelves With no one left to blame but ourselves  We didn't know what we'd had until it was gone And it breaks my heart to see you so withdrawn Did I ever tell you how sorry I feel? And all of this, now, seems so unreal  I wish I had been a better friend But I was too young to comprehend The terror inside your mind and delve Into the dark shadows, I was only twelve.  I look at you now and wish I had been there Perhaps I could lift you from your despair The loss of childhood, come too soon As we slept beneath the cold, full moon  There's a wall between us that I can't tear down So I can save you before you drown In your thoughts so dreary and dark By being the lantern; a distant spark.  Is there's nothing I can do for you now? Lost friend, if there is please tell me how Because I miss the way we used to be When you would smile and hold hands with me  But those days are gone forever it seems For you are haunted by your dreams And I was too immature to understand Instead of running I should've held your hand

						   These days nostalgia is lost on me I live for now instead of what will be Too happy to look back on yesterday I wish we could stay forever this way Such beautiful moments go by too fast Seconds, minutes and hours slip past Until all are gone; the day will end Knowing tomorrow you'll still be my friend Together up to the stars we gaze Singing, "These are the good old days"  When I'm with you I'm never judged I'm beside you when my makeups smudged My hairs in a mess and my jeans are torn Others look at me to frown and scorn But you stand by and hold my hand I can always count on you to understand But the sand keeps falling in the hour glass And what is now, too soon will pass Years will speed by, leaving us in a daze All the while singing, "These are the good old days"  The time of our parting draws on apace So I'll smile with you and save your place Forever if need be until you come home From wherever it is you've chosen to roam And though these tears may fall from my eyes I always knew we'd have to say our goodbyes I have no regrets though it hurts me so To look back on so long ago So one last time, under the sun's warm rays, We'll be singing, "These are the good old days"  For Page

						   From the day you're born, people give to you They give but never take They smile and cheer and wait for you They applaud all the progress you make They watch you grow into the life you live And as you live you learn It seems that all they do is give But get so little in return You notice how much these people care And help you become who you are You know they may not always be there But they'll never be too far Because what they give stays with you And helps you through the years It makes you want to give some too And wipe away other's tears Then you get your chance, one day To pass on the love you've got So you help others on their way And grow to love them a lot The more you give you come to find That the ones you love, love back And with each person that you are kind You see you get more when giving back

						   I watch as the gentle brook feeds the lake And I wonder how something so large Depends on something so small  I smell the scent of fire; burning pine And I wonder if any aroma could ever Bring back as sweet of memories   I watch the dragonflies dance on the water And I wonder if, over the centuries, Their dance has ever changed  I feel the warm wind against my skin And I wonder, truly, if what I feel Is the gentle breath of God  I watch the rocks break the water's flow And I wonder how long it will take Before the water breaks the rocks  I take in the world that lay before me And I wonder if anything could be More serene or beautiful than this

						   Each year I go back home And dream my summer away It may not be my real address But it's where you'll find my heart So what is home but a relative term For home is where your family is  Each year I meet my family And play my summer away They may not be blood related But they love me just the same So what is family but a relative term For a family is people who love  Each year I go where I am loved And laugh my summer away They may not have a reason but they love me anyway So love is not a relative term Because when I'm loved I'm home

						   My childhood lies in ruins It is the swing that hangs by one chain And the jungle gym set in pieces on the ground I watch the weeds grow They grow around my memories quickly Covering up the past so easily as time moves on My field is overgrown With grass and dandelions that grow in patches They were with the younger me before she passed I want go back to then When life was simple and fun didn't end But my childhood is still slipping from my grasp My recess is over It been over for years but not forgotten Now it's gone completely, a memory of happier times I cry for my loss of time But I still watch the clock ticking away the days As my last moments are wasted on wishing for more

						   It's been two years since I've seen your face I picture you now but you disappear Time has darkened your image in my mind Making what was once vivid, unclear I wish with all my soul to see you now But when I try I fail and fall again Then the despair grips me and I give in I fall willingly and relive the pain I left you at sixteen and moved forward I'm growing up and you are frozen Stuck in time and in my mind, you live Forever a freshmen; a could've been  I don't want your memory to fade from me But the clouds of time are rolling in And when the rain comes it washes you away So I must leave you buried within I watch the time with the eyes of a woman Years will go by and years have gone I'm struggle to hold on as the seasons change Others have left you; they must move on How can I blame them for leaving so fast? We are still children after all And the grief sweeps in as we think of you So much pain it hurts to recall  Sometimes I want to forget how you died And just simply think of you But for some reason, it pains me more If I try but I can't see you There are some nights when I've dreamt of you You hold me while I sit and cry A small favor given by your midnight visits But in the morning, another lie These years have brought on clarity anew Only love will bring us through And when the next two years pass me by Please know, Jared, I miss you
