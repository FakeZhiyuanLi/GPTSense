       by Britney Spears    Notice me, take my hand  Why are we strangers when  Our love is strong  Why carry on without me   Everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, it's haunting me  I guess I need you, baby   I make believe that you are here  It's the only way I see clear  What have I done  You seem to move on easy   And everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you, baby   I may have made it rain  Please forgive me  My weakness caused you pain  And this song's my sorry   At night I pray  That soon your face will fade away   And everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you, baby

      Amazing but true? how you get undressed reveals  your personality   If you throw your clothes all over the place, you  are a friendly, life-of-the-party type. You are  free with your thoughts and opinions, not caring  much about what others think of you. Your parents  might think your room looks like a cyclone hit  it? but it actually represents your happy,  individualistic nature!    If you remove each piece of clothing and put it  away carefully, you are a serious person who  likes her life to be very calm. You are  comfortable with routine, and you believe that  the best way to deal with life's problems is to  prevent them in the first place. You are a  perfectionist. By nature you are quite shy. You  are observant and you know more about some people  than they think, just because because you've  watched them. You are dependable and sometimes  intense. You think carefully before making  decisions. You go about your tasks methodically,  with concentration. You know how to pay  attention.    If you take off the shirt, and ten minutes later  get around to the pants, you are an extremely  self-confident person. You are naturally bright  and intellectual. You are also a deep thinker who  loves to ask questions and ponder the meaning of  things. You hate being rushed and you do not like  to be hassled. Usually you like a lot of free  time for yourself.    If you get out of your clothes as quickly as  possible, you are concerned about others and what  they expect from you, but you're worried about  your own needs. You are family-oriented, and stay  extremely busy. You often feel stressed, but most  of those heavy expectations come from your own  head! Give yourself a break, you don't have to be  perfect.    If you take off your rings, earrings, necklace,  watch, et cetera before anything else, you are a  warm and sensitive person. You are considerate  and thoughtful, and you give good advice to your  friends. You are a natural born romantic. (this is me)   If you don't have an undressing routine and you  never do it the same way twice, you are a very  curious and interesting person. You enjoy a broad  range of activities. You take risks and enjoy fun  and adventure. You are very social.

       My Immortal    by Evanescence    I'm so tired of being here Supressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  You used to captivate me by your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me

       How Did You Know    by Gary Valenciano    INTRO  I remember so well The day that you came into my life You asked for my name You had the most beautiful smile  My life started to change I'd wake up each day feeling alright With you right by my side Makes me feel things will work out just fine  CHORUS  How did you know I needed someone like you in my life That there's an empty space in my heart You came at the right time in my life  I'll never forget How you brought the sun to shine in my life  And took all the worries and fears that I had I guess what I'm really trying to say It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way No words can express how much I love you  Repeat Chorus

       The Reason   by Hoobastank   I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do  But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I found a reason for me To change who I use to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it the way And me the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I found a reason for me To change who I use to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I found a reason for me To change who I use to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you I found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

       PARA KAY "EX"    Tinanggal ko na  ang pangalan mo  sa phonebook ko.  Pinunit ko na rin  ang picture mo  sa wallet ko.  Ayoko nang pakinggan  ang mga kanta  na kinakanta mo noon  para sa `kin.  Pati mga palabas  na lagi mong pinapanood  ay ayaw ko na rin.  `Pag may lakad ako  `di ko na kailangang  magpaalam sa `yo.  `Di na rin kita tinatawagan  gaya ng dati  sa bahay pag-uwi ko.  `Pag nanalangin ako  ipinapanalangin ko nang lahat  maliban sa `yo.  Sinisiraan na rin kita  sa pamilya ko  at sa mga kaibigan ko.  Pero tanggalin ko man  ang pangalan mo  sa phonebook ko  kabisado ko pa rin  ang number mo.  Punitin ko man  ang picture mo  alam ko pa rin  ang itsura mo  tuwing pipikit ako.  Kahit `di ako tumawag  binabantayan ko  ang telepono  sakaling ikaw ang tumawag.  `Di kita ipinapanalangin  pero ikaw ang huling naiisip ko  bago matulog.  Sinisiraan kita  sa lahat ng kakilala ko  pero makokonsensiya lang ako  at tuluyang iiyak.  Tatahan lang ako  kapag kinakanta ko na  ang paborito mong kanta.

       Until I Get Over You  by Christinia Milian     Woke up today, thinking of you Another night and i made my way through So many dreams still left in my mind But it can never come true  I press rewind and remember when I close my eyes and I'm with you again But in the end I can still feel the pain Everytime I hear your name  Chorus: The sun won't shine since you went away Seems like the rains falling everyday, There's just one heart, where there once was two That's the way it's gotta be, until I get over you [You...]  Walk through the park in the evening air I heard a voice and I thought you were there I ran away, but I just can't escape Memories of you everywhere  They say the time will dry the tears That true love burns for a thousand years Give my tomorrows for one yesterday Just to know that I could have you here  Chorus: The sun won't shine, since you went away Seems like the rains falling everyday There's just one heart, where there once was two That's the way it's gotta be, until I get over you [Till I get over you...]  When will this river of tears stop falling Where can I run so i won't feel alone I can't walk away when the pain keeps calling Just gotta take it from here on my own But it's so hard to let go...... [Oh no no no] [Oh no no]  Chorus: The sun won't shine, since you went away Seems like the rains falling everyday There's just one heart, where there once was two That's the way it's gotta be, until I get over you [You.......] [You.......]  Thats the way its gotta be until i get over you [Until i get over....you.....]

       12 Better Explanations of LOVE....    1) Don't turn your back to love when it's  already in front of you, Don't drive it away  from you, because if you do, someday, you'll  think again, why you let love flew when it was  there next to you.  2) In Love, think things first over if you're  sure about how you feel, Don't fall too hard not  knowing where you will stand, 'coz it will hurt  real bad if things don't go the way you want  them to be.   3) It's an irony to know that it takes hours for  someone to have guts to say "hi" to the one he  likes, days to admire, weeks to miss the person,  months to love, but just a blink of an eye to  say goodbye...   4) Go for the person who loves you. It is not  wrong to love someone who belongs to someone  else, but it is much better to love someone who  could also love you in return.   5) Love isn't something we hold, it is something  we set free, It's not something we just do, but  it's something we don't imagine to be. Lastly,  it's not something we choose, it chooses us...   6) the scariest thing about falling in love is  getting hurt. The scariest thing about getting  hurt is not being able to love again. The  scariest thing about not loving again is being  alone forever.   7) When you follow your heart, worry not where  it will lead you, for your heart knows the way.  And if you do get lost or reach a dead end, use  your head to lead you back home.   8) When you truly care for someone, you don't  look for faults, you don't look for answers, you  don't look for mistakes. Instead, you fight for  the mistakes, you accept the faults, and you  overlook excuses.   9) It's better to lose your pride to the one you  love, than lose your loved one to your useless  pride.   10) Love is ......... not " it's your fault ",  but " I’m sorry ", not " where are you? ", but "  I’m here ", not " how could you? ", but " I  understand, not " I wish you were here ", but "  I’m thankful you are ".   11) The beginning of love is to let those we  love be just they, and not twist with our own  image. Otherwise, we love only the reflection of  ourselves we find in them.   12) If a relationship is truly meant for you,  your love will find a way to make it happen, and  God will be there to make sure it will stay.   -------------------  The Mysterious thing called "Love"... If you  find yourself in love with someone who does not  love you, be gentle with yourself. There is  nothing wrong with you. Love just didn't choose  to rest in the other person's heart. If you find  someone else in love with you and you don't love  him/her, feel honored that love came and called  at your door, but gently refuse the gift you  cannot return. Do not take advantage do not  cause pain. How you deal with love is how you  deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same  pains and joys even if our lives and ways are  different.  If you fall in love with another, and he/she  falls in love with you, and then love chooses to  leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess  blame, let it go. There is a reason and there is  a meaning. You will know in time. Remember that  you don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you  can really do is accept it for all its mystery  when it comes into your life. Feel the way it  fills you to overflowing, then reach out and  give it away. Give it back to the person who  brought it alive in you. Give it to others who  deem it poor in spirit. Give it to the world  around you in anyway you can.

       when d last teardrop fall   It's so hard to lose the one you love To finally have to say goodbye You try to be strong but the pain keeps holdin' on And all that you can do is cry Deep within your heart you know it's time to move  on When the fairy tale that you once knew is gone  >>Chorus When the last tear drop falls I'll still be holdin' on to all of our memories And all of what used to be When the last tear drop falls I will stand tall And know that you're here with me in my heart When the last tear drop falls..  So now I'm alone and life keeps movin' on But my destination still unknown, oh yeah Will there be a time when I'll fall in love again? When I was meant to walk these streets alone If there was just one wish I could be granted  here tonight It would be to have you right back by my side       >>Chorus  Now it's time for me to find my happiness again And the emptiness from missin' you Will never ever end, baby       >>Chorus

      As I watch you move, across the moonlit room There's so much tenderness in your loving Tomorrow I must leave, the dawn knows no reprieve God give me strength when I am leaving...  So raise your hands to heaven and pray That we'll be back together someday  Tonight, I need your sweet caress Hold me in the darkness Tonight, you calm my restlessness You relieve my sadness  As we move to embrace, tears run down your face I whisper words of love, so softly I can't believe this pain, it's driving me insane Without your touch, life will be lonely  So raise your hands to heaven and pray That we'll be back together someday  Tonight, I need your sweet caress Hold me in the darkness Tonight, you calm my restlessness You relieve my sadness  Morning has come, another day I must pack my bags and say goodbye... Goodbye...  Tonight, I need your sweet caress Hold me in the darkness Tonight, you calm my restlessness You relieve my sadness

      Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others including Love. One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all repaired their boats and left.  Love wanted to persevere until the last possible moment. When the island was almost sinking, Love decided to ask for help. Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you."  Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel, "Vanity, please help me!" "I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat." Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked for help, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh....Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!"  Happiness passed by Love too, but he was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her!  Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come Love, I will take you." It was an elder. Love felt so blessed and overjoyed that he even forgot to ask the elder his name. When they arrived at dry land,  the elder went his own way.  Love realizing how much he owed the elder and asked Knowledge, another elder, "Who helped me?" "It was Time,"  Knowledge answered. "Time?" asked Love. "But why did Time help me?" Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, "Because, only Time is capable of  understanding how great Love is."

       It beats through your heart, burns through your skin and melts your senses.  It compasses all human emotions and justifies all human reason.  It holds no bounds, breaks all barriers, scales all heights and defies all depths.  It is a question that answers all inquiry, and an answer that questionsall knowledge; a mystery of the mind and a secret of the soul.  Indescribable, immeasurable, indefiable.  It is pure, undefined and simple.  It is the unknown, the utopian, the dream of all dreamers.  It is the core, the polestar, the center, and the beginning.  It runs courses, lacerates sentiment and intemsifies passion.    It is Romance.  A taste of heaven, a sensation of bliss.  It is faith and conviction.  It's an aura in the atmosphere.  It is multiplied: over and over and over again.  It's louder than  the storms, deeper than floods, more blinding that the sun and the most electrifying of all forces.  It is elemental.  It is beautiful and stunning.  It's words, words, words.  Ironies and paradoxes, going in circles, never to be answered; riddles of feeling.  A touch, a kiss, a priceless show of affection.  It is delight and happiness.  It's ecstacy.  It can combat forces, destroy destruction, and war.  It is life and death all over again.    IT IS LOVE...    my.rose.1",7

       6, 8, 12    by Brian McKnight    Do you ever think about me Do you ever cry yourself to sleep In the middle of the night when you awake Are you calling out for me Do you ever reminisce I can't believe I'm acting like this I know it's crazy How I still can feel your kiss   Chorus:  It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you went away I miss you so much And I don't know what to say I should be over you I should know better But it's just not the case It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you went away  Do you ever ask about me Do your friends still tell you what to do Everytime the phone rings Do you wish it was me callin' you Do you still feel the same Or has time put out the flame I miss you Is everything ok   Chorus   It's hard enough just passing the time When I can't seem to get you off my mind And where is the good in goodbye Tell me why, tell me why   Chorus

      A girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the  road...   Girl: Slow down. Im scared.  Guy: No this is fun.  Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!  Guy: Then tell me you love me.  Girl: Fine,  I love you . Slow down!  Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.   *Girl hugs him*   Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on  yourself? Its bugging me.   (In the paper the next day):   A  motorcycle  had crashed into a building because  of break failure.  2 people  were on it, but only  1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the  road,  the guy realized that his breaks broke ,  but he didn't want to let the girl know.  Instead,  he had her say she loved him & felt her  hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so  that she would live even though it meant that he  would die.     If there's anyone you love this much on here, pass this to anyone so that they will know how much you can sacrifice just for the sake of your very special someone!!!

          Sweet, can I sing you the song of your kisses? How soft is this one, how subtle this is, How fluttering swift as a bird’s kiss that is, As a bird that taps at a leafy lattice; How this one clings and how that uncloses From bud to flowers in the way of roses; And this through laughter and that through weeping Swims to the brim where Love lies sleeping; And this point I snatch, and capture That in the ecstasy of rapture, When the odorous red-rose petals part That my lips may find their way to the heart Of the rose of the world, your lips, My Rose. But no song knows The way of my heart to the heart of MY.ROSE.

         A story is told about a soldier who was finally coming home from the war. He called his parents from San Francisco.  "Mom and Dad, I'm coming home, but I've a favor to ask. I have a friend I'd like to bring home with me."  "Sure," they replied, "we'd love to meet him."  "There's something you should know" the son continued, "he was hurt pretty badly in the fighting. He stepped on a land mind and lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to come live with us."  "I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live."  "No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us."  "Son," said the father, "you don't know what you're asking. Someone with such a handicap would be a terrible burden on us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let something like this interfere with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He'll find a way to live on his own."  At that point, the son hung up the phone. The parents heard nothing more from him. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling from a building, they were told. The police believed it was suicide. The grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the city morgue to identify the body of their son. They recognized him, but to their horror they also discovered something they didn't know, their son had only one arm and one leg.  The parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun to have around, but we don't like people who inconvenience us or make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are. Thankfully, there's someone who won't treat us that way. Someone who loves us with an unconditional love that welcomes us into the forever family, regardless of how messed up we are.  Tonight, before you tuck yourself in for the night, say a little prayer that God will give you the strength you need to accept people as they are, and to help us all be more understanding of those who are different from us!!! There's a miracle called Friendship That dwells in the heart You don't know how it happens Or when it gets started But you know the special lift It always brings And you realize that Friendship Is God's most precious gift! Friends are a very rare jewel, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed They lend an ear, they share a word of praise, and they always want to open their hearts to us.  You now have 2 choices.  1.) Show your friends how much you care.... Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND. If it comes back to you, then you'll know you have a friend for life.  2.) Don't send this to anyone and act like it didn't touch your heart.
