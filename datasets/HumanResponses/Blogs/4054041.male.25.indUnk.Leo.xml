        I was watching the premiere of Atlantis again the other night when Bran and I spotted one of the frequently seen, yet never seen too much, technicians that roam around the SGC. Everytime we see one of these two partciular individuals, something apparantly clicks in our minds. a kind of.. "Wow, they're cool.. they should really, you know, do something..". Of course, being that it's "Stargate: SG-1" and not "Stargate: Everybody Else", that's not to be.. yet look at this two distinctly different characters, something rang in my mind. They also seemed very familiar.    Firstoff, there's the "gate operator", Walter Davis. This poor guy is constantly getting hosed as far as ACTUAL things to do are concerned. This is why I immediatly compared him with Miles O'Brien. Now.. I also immediatly compared our second character with O'Brien as well.. and to help prevent further confusion, I shall refer to this comparison as "TNG Miles O'Brien". You see, Miles of TNG era didn't do a whole hell of a lot. He operated the transporters, for crying out loud.. WORF could operate the transporters.. any Alien of the Week could operate the transporters.. yet.. they need someone who's sole duty was to tap some LCARS and slide his fingers up the padd. Much the same way that Davis is relegated to just a few, small, simple things. He opens the gate, dialing addresses and locking in chevrons (keep in mind, this is only when a member of SG-1 doesn't do it for him). He's also tasked with opening and closing the gate's IRIS device, to prevent access of a hostile nature. Granted.. these things are very important.. but comeon. This guy is a Sergeant for crying out loud.. and he's also pretty smart, as evidenced in a couple of eps where they actually gave him a line or two. Does he get to go offworld? No. Does he get to do ANYTHING but operate the damned gate computer? Well.. yes.. in the future he got to be a tour guide for the renovated SGC, after it had been exposed to the public and was used as a museum. Yea.    Then there's the guy who gets a little LESS of the shaft. Siler.. no first name.. just, Master Sergeant "Sly" Siler. This guy I compare more to the likes of "DS9 Miles O'Brien". He's the guy who can fix pretty much any mechanical or mechanicaly related system.. it's like he roams the mountain complex just LOOKING for things to fix. He's saved almost every member of SG-1 at some point or another.. and I'm fully convinced that without him, the entire SGC would have ground to a halt right after dialing Abydos for the first time (The first time in the series, not the first time in the movie.. which doesn't have ANYTHING to do with this.. aside from the name and source material. Err.. yea..). Does he get more screen time? Nah. Does he even get a full freaking name? No.    Just.. some things I noted. Sad.. I know.. but, I compare things. It's something I do.. apparantly.
