       urlLink andPOP | Is Fahrenheit 9/11 Eligible for an Oscar?  I seriously believe that this picture should not only be nominated but obiously deserves to win. I would not be suprised if in few years down the road this movie would be used as an educational tool for our youngsters in describing  Bush's presidency. I loved the movie. It was entertaining, tough provoking, and down right scary. I enjoyed it and I believe it should be shown on American TV. Overall the movie deserves an oscar and should get it.

      My darling six year old decided to come up with one of those wonderful questions, only one her age could come up with, and coming up with an answer is becoming more and more difficult.  "Mommy, where did we begin" she said , "Do you mean, where we came from" I replied " No, like were we came before we were in our mummy's tummies" she expanded"  Now I was faced with the challenge of deciding how to answer. She has been going to Sunday school so the Biblical version was familiar, yet I did not want her to take it necessarily verbatim, and I have every intention to tell her about evolution. So I started by telling her there are two ways of looking at this. One says that God created us. He created the earth, the sun and the moon. The water the animals and then a man, Adam. He then took the rib of Adam and created the woman, Eve. Adam and Eve then began to have babies. She liked this explanation. Then I continued, the other way is to believe in Darwins theory of evolution. This means we are all evolved from each other. That we all evolved to what we are today from something we were before. I said some dinosaurs became birds and whales, and we evolved from the apes. She laughed at this notion. She maid it very clear that she liked the biblical version so much better. I guess there are answers that are ok when you are six. I still feel good having exposed her to a notion she may not comprehend today, yet it will be familiar when the notion is more acceptable. I think all answers should be given with a bit of truth even if just simplified. I am glad that she has been exposed to a organized religion, since it gives her the basic moral values to live by. Yet I want her to be curious enough to pose questions and be exposed to different answers. In few years Darwing may make more sense, but today I like the simplistic innocence still preserved in her.  urlLink http://www.darwins-theory-of-evolution.com/

      Let me tell you a really weird story. Me and my family consume 3 five gallon water bottles a week. Since the water delivery company only delivers every 3 weeks, I can not store 9 bottles in my house and therefore must visit my local Publix to get the waterbottles. Obviously they charge me a deposit for every bottle. Well,  we at times have 5 to 6 empty bottles in the house and I load the car up and take them to the store. Well lately I had been given a really hard time in returning them. I was told that I could only return as many as I was purchasing etc. Each and every time the "rules" became more and more difficult. Finally I had it, I asked for a manager and after a very long time he showed up. He explained to me that there had been a re occuring theft of water from his store. That they actually caught the guy on tape and he was stealing the water, pouring it out on the parking lot and then returning the empty bottles for the $6.00 each deposit fee. He said that since I clearly was not the gut then there would be no reason to suspect me and I could continue to return my bottles. Needless to say my husband is still a suspect, due to the gender issue. I told the manager that since the bottles were purchased there, then they should be able to be returned there also. I did not appreciate being treated as a criminal and I suggested they move they're bottled water away from the front door therefore eliminating it being so easily stolen. After a couple of weeks I went back again with empty bottles. I was not given a hard time this time but they all knew whom I was. I had loved the anonymous of my visits, and I did not appreciate being recognized. Well this bothered me so much that I emailed Publix and email sharing my concerns with they're policy of treating the water customers as potential criminals. The next day after my email. I got a message from the store manager that he wanted to talk. Then my husband spoke with the District Manager, whom said he would look into it. I did not immediately return the store managers message. We left the house to spend a afternoon shopping. When I got home, I noticed that the gate to our backyard was open, and I feared the Dog had gotten loose. Dog had not strayed, but I could not figure why the usually locked gate, was now open. When I got in there was a message from the store manager " I stopped by your hours" This freaked me out. Certainly I had included my address, they could have sent me an letter of apology, not a Stalking Publix Store Manager. Then the phone rings again.....yep him again, luckily my husband answered. He kept on insisting that he wanted to shake our hands....He wanted to come to our house again.....Absolutely not said my husband. Anyway the whole moral of this story is......Do not dear to complain, in writing.....The manager may be a stalker....You would think that they hire managers that know not to trespass on customers homes. What a freaks experience......Oh I am shopping at Albertsons now on....
