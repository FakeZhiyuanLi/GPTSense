      Okay so last night, I watched / commentated to my dad in florida the whole game, one of the greatest comebacks ever! Well maybe not ever, but for little leauge baseball, this one was pretty spectacular.&nbsp; My brother ( who is an amazing baseball player) and his all-star&nbsp; team, are at the end of sectional play.&nbsp; Now normally, any team from A-town would be considered well out of the race for a big finish in this tourney, but this team's got somethin. Okay so they make a few errors... let me rephrase that, they make ALOT of errors, but then again who's perfect. And they've got the bats to back it up!&nbsp; ANY way, we were playing the squirrels from Joshua,( we call them the Rodents, cuz their so obnoxious, rude, and play so dirty.) and every one at the ball park was rootin for us to beat them,&nbsp; because whoever lost this game, was&nbsp;done with&nbsp;baseball for this season and obviously they had burned more than a few bridges with the other teams in past games.&nbsp; Well we were doing well the first 4 innings, but then all of a sudden the bats awoke for them, and we were dead asleep in the field.&nbsp; Error after error, short throw after short throw, missed fly ball after... well you get the picture.&nbsp; Finally we got out of the inning. With heads down and spirits definatley not at their highest we went up to bat.&nbsp; Luckly, our top&nbsp; of the lineup was up to bat, so we started the hitting of with a few good hits! So we got a few runs, then it was back out to the field.&nbsp; 3 up and 3 down. Not a sole touched those bags that at bat for them, which was oh so good for us.&nbsp; This was the last chance we had. It was the bottom of the 7th ( they only play 7 innings) and we were back at the top of our lineup.&nbsp; Some awesome hits and some skilled base running/ stealing took place and before we knew it we were tied 7 to 7! SO the third out came around shortly after, but no problem, cuz they once again didnt touch the bases that last inning, and what do you know we scored after three batters!&nbsp; So needless to say it was a Sweet Victory for&nbsp; A- town last night and now tonight were gona try&nbsp; to double dip 'em for the championship game tomorow!&nbsp; Boy I love baseball!&nbsp; Well&nbsp; I gotta go get ready for the game!&nbsp; Ill be back on later tonight to letcha know whats goin on in the&nbsp; Wonderful world of Sports!&nbsp;  PS: there was more than just the game goin on last night.. tons of bantering between their coaches and the umpire, their players and our player, and their fans&nbsp; and a bunch of people who really cared less what they had to say.. but in the end we shut em up! :)&nbsp; Plus it gave the game a little extra kick ! &nbsp;

      The memory is a funny thing. IT always seems to remember the things you never hoped to keep dragging along with you down the road to the future, but yet throws out things that you really want to cherish, like your Blogger Password. Yes, thats right, I forgot my password. Now im usually not one to give up, but when it comes to networks, computers, or other fairly complicated things, I tend to back down quite easily. In this case, the solution was simple. I had only one option: Start Over.  My other blog, which at the end of the school year mysteriously fell into a coma, is now no longer existant.  But amazingly, I managed to pull out the last few ideas it stored from its memory, which is luckly alot better at remembering things than mine is, and doesent give up quite as easily when it comes to malfunctions. So, soon I will be adding those cherished epiphinies I managed to drag out of my old blog archives. They wont necessairily be in chronological order, or make any sense what so ever to most people, but maybe they will add a little "FLUFF" to my blog:) In addition I will soon be adding some new  ideas/opinions ive derived this summer,  much to "someones" opinion i have plenty to talk about!  So until then this is all I've got! Talk to all yall again soon! and Hi to everybody in the big HRCO:) hope yall are havin an awesome summer, and not havin TOO much fun without me!   Gotta Run! ChEeRz  ~niki~
