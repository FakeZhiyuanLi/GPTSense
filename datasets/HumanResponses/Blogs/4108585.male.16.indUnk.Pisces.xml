      Yo... this is my first post... I don't know how this'll look on the journal, but I'll tweak it accordingly for a decent looking blog. I'll use language, so, if you're one of those who tell your mom to look at what you're surfing through on the internet, light something invaluable (to your wonderful mother) on fire while browsing this page. While she's off taking care of the fire and getting a trident to murder you, you can spend your last few minutes alive browsing. I'll see what other features this thing has so that I can add more content to make it a bit cooler. Whatever. I'll post later. --Kiran

      Aight, so, I'm bored... anyone got any ideas? I'm gonna publish the fuck outta this blog on all the websites of mine... as many as I got. I'll keep myself entertained. Well, I had a decent time in the Kaplan SAT prep class, today... it was my highlight of the day. Here's what that class has taught me to do (as a class clown, and I urge you all... if you want to do these, please give me credit and tell the teacher boldly that I did it. I will be proud to be your, the future class clown's, role model.) Anyway, here's what the list says: A few things you can do during the SAT and get away with: 1. Roll a strip of white printer paper and stick it under your tongue. When the proctor looks around, make sure you get his/her attention by getting the paper out of your mouth... they can't kick you out, and even if they ask you to show it, it's a harmless, plain piece of white paper. 2. Start making random calculations in the middle of a verbal section and make sure you punch the calculator loud enough to get peoples' attention. And once they ask you, just say you wanted to calculate your proctor's age. (Note: there are never  hot , young ladies proctoring the tests... if there are, well, you're a lucky cunt.) 3. Always write "OK", "why?" "The SATs are so gay." or something, to piss off the rainbow fucker who's putting your paper in the scantron scanning machine, in places where it says "Do not write anything in this area." 4. If you have your SAT prep class at a Kaplan center (or any other center where the proctors will not stay in the room during any practice test), the proctors will  always  be out of your room, which gives you additional chances to be the class clown. In scenarios like that, always be attentive because it will give you yet another chance to: A. Talk to your friend for answers in the middle of a practice test. B. If you're listening carefully, you  might  hear one of the people at the front desk, or nearby, laughing, and if you do, stop whatever you're doing and just blurt out a "HE HE HE" like Homer Simpson. Trust me. People  will  laugh. C. Once you're done your whole class (making sure you've done all your homework, etc.) apply for a refund and tell them you'll be buying yourself a new television with the money-back and thank them once again. D. Since they give you a non-monitored break, you can look ahead in your test and start answering questions in the next section. I'll update this list after I think of more things to do. For now, that's all I have. Something I need to say... you can use whatever I said, but you can't hold that against me because you got raped out of the exam hall because you did what was told here and spiced it up with your utter-fucking-stupidity. No, you can  not  file a lawsuit against me and all these things are fucking copyrighted, you whore. Just e-mail me... I'll approve it... I'm not one of those copyright whores that hog their own stuff so much people will copy it behind their back. If you tell me, I'll let you, if you don't, I'll let you go if you're a decent person, at least to other people. I won't sue you... lawsuits are a pain in peoples' asses. Whatever. I'm being nice so take care. I'll blog your brains out next time. --Kiran
