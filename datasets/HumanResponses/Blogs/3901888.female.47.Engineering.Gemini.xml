       I know everyone has pet peeves, and some of mine are probably the same as a lot of other people, so I thought I would just vent a little and list some of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   First, just so you know, &nbsp;I like to think&nbsp;of myself as a person who is generally kind, polite, and thinks about other people.&nbsp; Therefore, when my actions DO affect others, I try to be considerate.&nbsp; I try to think how I would like to be treated.&nbsp; I think the Golden Rule pretty much applies to the way I feel.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I don't think this is the same for a lot of other people which I seem to encounter on a daily basis.   For example:&nbsp; When I am driving down the road and am going to be turning onto a street and I &nbsp;see someone waiting at an intersection for me, I turn on my turning signal.&nbsp; I have enough decency not to mention consideration for the other person&nbsp;to click on my turn signal.&nbsp;&nbsp; This lets the driver of the other vehicle know that you are going to be turning.&nbsp; I know...common sense...&nbsp;so, why don't people do it?&nbsp; I hate it when I am waiting for a car to pass so I can go and then they turn.&nbsp;&nbsp; It ticks me off, and I usually express my unhappiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they not see I am sitting there waiting for them to pass?&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just rude not to mention lazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; How much effort does it take to reach up and click on your turn signal when you are going to turn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this does involve using one of your hands and that is probably hard to do for some people when one hand is on the steering wheel and the other is holding a cell phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; People use your turn signals!   Now, I KNOW this pet peeve a lot of people can relate too.&nbsp; How many times do you get in the check-out line in the grocery store that says: "10 items or less and&nbsp;CASH ONLY"?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't even begin to tell you how many times I am standing in line with LESS than 10 items, like the sign says, and there will be someone in front of me with a whole basket full of groceries.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, they aren't paying cash for all these groceries.&nbsp; I have grunted many times at people doing that.&nbsp; I know most people can count to ten, so what compels them to do this?   I use to work part-time in a grocery store when I was in high school.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most the time I was on the "normal" register, but when I worked on the register that said "10 items or less and CASH ONLY", I did not let any one come through my line that did not meet those criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would stop them before they began to unload their cart and tell them that this was an express lane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most just didn't realize it was an express lane and apologized and moved to the next check-out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other would complain and whine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still held my ground and made them get into another line.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other customers that were waiting&nbsp; in line that did have only ten items or less would always thank me and tell me how much they appreciated me doing that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just trying to do the right thing and be fair to those people who actually were in the right check-out line.   One day, after I had been waiting in line with my two items, I asked a cashier&nbsp;why she had let the man in front of me go through the line with a basket full of groceries?&nbsp; Why didn't she tell him that&nbsp; this was the express line and make him get in another line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told that if she did that and the customer complained to the manager that she would get in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have liked to have talked to that manager and asked him why did the store have an express lane if they weren't going to enforce the rules?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not just make it another&nbsp;regular register?&nbsp; &nbsp;A manager that gets mad at an employee for doing what is right and obeying the rules &nbsp;is no manager.   Here is another store related pet peeve.&nbsp; I was in Home Depot last week waiting in line to be checked out.&nbsp; I was holding two light fixtures and some light bulbs.&nbsp; They weren't heavy...&nbsp;just a little bulky and awkward to hold.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a man in line in front of me who had put all his merchandise on the counter.&nbsp; He still had his empty shopping cart in front of him.&nbsp; He could have moved up a little where I could put my merchandise on the counter, but he just stood there with his back to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought how inconsiderate.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was plenty of room on the counter for my items if he would have only moved up closer &nbsp;to the register.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always try to help the person behind me especially if I see they are holding items.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will move my items up and even put the divider between their items and mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is always appreciated.   Anyway, this man stood there while the cashier rang up&nbsp;a basket full of&nbsp;items.&nbsp;&nbsp; She then&nbsp;told him the price.&nbsp; He THEN reached in his back pocket and pulled out his check book and begin filling out his check.&nbsp;&nbsp; WHY didn't&nbsp;he fill out everything except the price&nbsp;WHILE he was just standing there??? &nbsp;So, there I was holding all these items, watching him write his check in slow motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;As soon as I&nbsp;put my items on the counter, I&nbsp;IMMEDIATELY take&nbsp;out my check book and fill&nbsp; in everything except the price.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the cashier tells me the amount, boom...I fill that part out and&nbsp;I am done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this is just another example of a rude inconsiderate person.   Here is an oldie but a goodie.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have read my blog, you know I live in Beaumont, TX and work in Lake Charles, LA.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is about an hour commute.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a good driver.&nbsp; I am 47 years old and have been driving since I was 15 without an accident.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had only one ticket and that was about 5 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; That has been my first and only ticket, so I think of myself as a pretty good driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;   On this hour commute, I come in contact with all sorts of drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The speed limit on IH-10 is 70 mph.&nbsp;&nbsp; I encounter people going anywhere from 40 to 90+ mph.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the law states, I only get in the left hand lane to pass someone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am not one of those people who jumps out in front of someone while trying to pass.&nbsp;If a car&nbsp;is going slower than me and I want to pass, &nbsp;I will just slow down and wait until I have a big opening before I get into the left lane to pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't tell how many times I have done this and while passing the slower vehicle, a car will come up doing 90 mph and be on my bumper before I know it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I do NOT pull out into the passing lane unless I have a huge opening because I hate when someone does that to me, so being the considerate person that I am, I will make sure I have a big opening before I begin to pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Cars will come up to me flashing their lights for me to get out of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I don't pa-pa around.&nbsp; I drive about 75 mph, but I am not going to speed to get around someone so the person behind me can go 90 especially in Louisiana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drive&nbsp;about 75 mph, so &nbsp;when I pass someone I am doing about 80.&nbsp; So for a person to come flying up behind me and start flashing their lights for me to get out of the way really irritates me.&nbsp; I am getting out of the way as fast as I can, but that usually isn't good enough for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am already going 80, and I will not go any faster just because I am an inconvenience&nbsp; to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they really really tick me off, then I just tap my brakes and actually start doing the speed limit.&nbsp; If they would have just been patient and left me alone, they would have already been around.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; People who drive that fast and that recklessly obviously don't care about themselves, so if they want to do that and go kill themselves, that's fine, but unfortunately, they usually take an innocent bystander with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing is worth speeding and going that fast and risking your life and others.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever&nbsp; you are hurrying to get to, will still be waiting for you in 5 or 10 minutes later.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the speed limit.&nbsp; Think of others.&nbsp; Think of yourself.   Now, my last pet peeve I am going to list is one that my guys (co-workers) pick at me about.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am getting on the highway and I am going up the ramp to get onto the highway, &nbsp;I pick up speed.&nbsp; This way by the time I am to the highway I am doing the same speed as the people on the highway, and therefore, I just merge and blend in.&nbsp; To me, THAT is what the ramp is for.....to get your vehicle&nbsp;up to highway speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; If everyone did that, then for the most part, you could just slip right into the traffic.&nbsp; Sounds simple enough.   Now here is what I get picked on about.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am the one on the highway and someone is coming up the ramp to get onto the highway, the guys say I should move over and let that person on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if they would do like I do and get their speed up, there is&nbsp; no reason for anyone to have to move.&nbsp; I might have to&nbsp;vary my speed a little to allow for them to get&nbsp; in front of me or behind me, but that should be about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; How many times have you seen a person going up the ramp doing about 30 mph&nbsp;and trying to get on&nbsp;a highway where the people on the highway are doing 70+ mph.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, how many times do you see a person at the end of the ramp&nbsp;&nbsp;at a complete stop&nbsp; blinking trying to get onto the&nbsp;highway?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   This is the situation where my guys think I should move over and let&nbsp;the person&nbsp;get on the highway.&nbsp; I tell them why should I do their driving for them.&nbsp; If they do not know how to enter a highway, they shouldn't be driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They think that is mean and inconsiderate of me.&nbsp;I don't think so.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they only knew how many times I have gotten over in the left hand lane&nbsp;and have gotten screwed because of me trying to be nice, they wouldn't say that.&nbsp;   This is what&nbsp;SHOULD happen, but hardly ever does.&nbsp; When I move over and let another person get on the highway, after I let them on, I get back in front of them or behind them.&nbsp; Therefore, I am out of the fast lane and back in my lane, and I hardly had to even change my speed.&nbsp; It rarely happens like that.&nbsp; Usually what happens is I move over in the fast lane and the person that is getting onto the highway &nbsp;finally gets on&nbsp;and then realizes what that peddle on the right is for and punches it and speeds up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I am stuck in the left lane with traffic coming up behind me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I can get over back into the right lane, the people who were coming up behind me is now jumping into the right lane passing me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I look like an idiot driving in the fast lane while everyone is going around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes me a while to get back over.&nbsp;   All this would never happen if the person getting on the highway would have found their accelerator BEFORE getting on the highway and just merged and blended with the traffic.&nbsp; THAT is why I rarely move and let anyone get on the highway.&nbsp;   Those are my pet peeves for today, but I know I am not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure others were reading this and shaking their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it...what if everyone went the speed limit, used their turn signals, looked before changing lanes, used the ramps to merge, etc.....wow, probably a lot less wrecks...who knows..probably a lot less road rage also.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try it sometimes...be courteous and friendly.&nbsp; Just remember how&nbsp; you would want to be treated.

       I have added a few sites to my little blogroll.    The first, Opinionated Foo, is the work of my friend's thirteen-year-old daughter. She and I share many of the same opinions about animals.     The second, Richardson Zoo, is another animal lover.     The third, Mostly Cajun, is my best friend and co-worker.  He's liable to write about anything and is very opinionated.     There are also some new buttons for animal lovers.  Please click on them and help...     If the site looks a bit chopped up, it's because we're trying to learn HTML while building this blog...

       I wanted to write about "my guys".&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, that is what I call them.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The guys I am talking about are my co-workers.&nbsp; To&nbsp;give you a little bit of background, I work for an electrical testing company.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started working for this type of business in February, 1995.&nbsp; I did not know anything about this type of business absolutely NOTHING!&nbsp;&nbsp; But as time went by, I began to learn.&nbsp; In fact, I had to learn and learn fast.&nbsp; For I had only been working for the company for two months, when our operations manager just quit.&nbsp; One day he was there, and&nbsp;the next day&nbsp;he was gone.&nbsp; His desk was cleaned out, his pictures gone, and his office locked.&nbsp; This left me all alone in the office.&nbsp; I had just barely figured out&nbsp; how the phone system and filing system worked, and NOW I was all alone.&nbsp; Yikes!  &nbsp;  There were five technicians who were also employed there, but for the most part, they&nbsp;stayed out in the field on jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I might would see them in the morning or in the afternoon, but for the most part,&nbsp;I was there by myself alone.  &nbsp;  Every time the phone would ring, I would cringe because I knew it was someone wanting something that I probably would have no idea about what they were talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the phone would ring, I actually prayed for it to be a wrong&nbsp;number or a sales person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least those, I knew how to handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I would have the guys calling me asking me if we had a "Doble" test set in the shop or some other type of&nbsp; testing equipment.&nbsp; I would have customers calling me about such things as&nbsp;relay testing, transformer testing or asking me about&nbsp; hipotting cables, pulling oil samples.&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk about a head spinning.&nbsp; I hadn't a clue about any of this, but little by little, I learned.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I learned fast.&nbsp; There is just so long that a person can sound stupid before someone notices, so I had an incentive to learn all of this and fast.   One day when one of the technicians were in the office doing some paper work, I asked him if he could tell me about the test equipment. &nbsp; I wanted to know the name of the equipment, what it looked like, and what it was used for.&nbsp; By having all of that information, they&nbsp;didn't have to stop working and come into the office and look for themselves.&nbsp; They could just call and ask me, and I would actually know.&nbsp; It took a couple of times before they felt comfortable with my answers.&nbsp; After that, they learned to trust me and rely on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After about six months, I got promoted to Assistant Operations Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was the assistant manager over&nbsp;the Beaumont and Lake Charles, LA office.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got a company car, and they paid my gas.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was great, and I loved my job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one day, after working there for 7 years, they decided to close the Beaumont office.&nbsp; Everyone in the office was let go except me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt awful for my co-workers and the technicians, but I had been looking at the profit and loss statement for that office for sometime, &nbsp;and the revenue that was coming in was just not enough to justify that office.&nbsp; So when they did close it, &nbsp;it wasn't a real big shock.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had questioned it myself long before they decided to do something.  &nbsp;  Our corporate office was in Houston, TX, and the management decided to keep me on and asked if I would mind working out of the Lake Charles office.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told them that was not a problem.&nbsp; Compared to the alternative, I decided to make the hour commute to Lake Charles.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The closing of the Beaumont office was in January of 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guys from&nbsp;the Lake Charles office came over, and we &nbsp;moved all my furniture, files, office machines, computers basically everything out of my office to Lake Charles.&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly didn't mind at all.&nbsp; The four technicians that worked in that office were great.&nbsp;&nbsp; They made me feel welcomed and didn't seem to mind giving up some of their space.&nbsp;&nbsp; They made room for me which was a task within itself.&nbsp; That office was one big room with me and 4 guys.&nbsp; Needless to say, we became close.&nbsp;&nbsp; We heard each others conversations, got to know about each others family, knew about&nbsp;each others&nbsp;problems.&nbsp; Basically nothing was sacred in there because we were all in one big room. But it also made us close like a family.&nbsp; I really liked that, and I loved working with them.  &nbsp;  But, and there always is a but, all good things must come to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp; One terrible day in May, my boss from the Houston office walked in and told me that upper management just couldn't justify an administrative person for just 4 guys.&nbsp;&nbsp; They laid me off.&nbsp; I was devastated.&nbsp; After working there 8 years, I no longer had a job.&nbsp; I was numb.&nbsp; I don't think it actually sunk in until I&nbsp;was on my way home. &nbsp; The Lake Charles operations manager gave me a ride home.&nbsp; I cried and cried and cried.&nbsp; I knew it was nothing I had done wrong because my boss from Houston was giving me &nbsp;a letter of recommendation and plus he looked&nbsp;genuinely &nbsp;sorry about the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never blamed him or the company.&nbsp; For the eight years I was employed there, they were very very good to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will always remember that.  &nbsp;  For some reason, the four technicians did not like what they did to me.&nbsp; They kept saying if someone&nbsp; as loyal as you could get laid off, then we might be next.&nbsp; I told them not to do anything crazy, and I was sure they would have a job forever if they wanted it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess they were not so sure, so they began to look elsewhere.   They didn't leave because of what happened to me, but I think it just made them look at the company in a different light.  &nbsp;  All I knew was I had been working with these guys for 8 years, and I was going to miss them terribly.&nbsp; Now, don't get me wrong, they could be butts sometimes, but 90% of the time, they were great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't know what I was going to do.&nbsp; The company gave me 8 weeks severance pay which was good of them to do, so I didn't have to run out and find a new job instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then one day, I got a call from my Lake Charles operation manager, Dale.&nbsp; It had only been about 2 weeks since I had left.&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked me how long did I want to stay unemployed?&nbsp; I asked what was he talking about.&nbsp; He said that he and they guys had talked to another company who basically was the competition and that they wanted to hire all of us...me included!!&nbsp;&nbsp; That day, they all faxed over their resignations &nbsp;and gave their notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Words cannot express how happy I was to be working with these guys again...Dale, Paul, John, Danny.&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart started beating again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a JOB!!!  &nbsp;  I was going to be making the same pay but no company car or paid gas this time.&nbsp; But I didn't care, I had a job and a job with my guys again.&nbsp;&nbsp; We found an office, and I furnished it and was back at work by June 17 of the same year.&nbsp; It is the exact same work only with a different company.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As of today, I have been here just a little over two years, and I hope to stay forever if they will have me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people dread going to work.&nbsp; I look forward to it.&nbsp; I love my job, and I am damn good at it even if I say so myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes the difference to me is the people I work with.&nbsp; They are all caring, smart, and intelligent people who every day do a dangerous job working with high voltage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I worry about them when they are in the field, but then&nbsp; I know they are the best at what we do, so I know they will be ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know at the end of the day they will be coming in here picking at me about something or complaining about something, but that's alright.&nbsp; It's just my guys!

       A   friend of mine sent this to me, so I thought I would share it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know&nbsp;if there is a Mildred Hondorf or if the story is even true, but it was a touching story nevertheless, so I decided to post it.....   &nbsp;   My name is Mildred Hondorf. I am a former elementary school music teacher from DeMoines, Iowa.I've always supplemented my income by teaching piano lessons&nbsp; something I've done for over 30 years. Over the years I found that children have many levels of musical ability. I've never had the pleasure of having a&nbsp; protégée though I have taught some talented students. However I've also had my share of what I call "musically challenged" pupils.     &nbsp;   One such student was Robby.&nbsp; Robby was 11 years old when his Mother (a single Mom) dropped him off for his first piano lesson. I prefer that students (especially boys) begin at an earlier age, which I explained to Robby. But Robby said that it had &nbsp;always been his mother's dream to hear him play the piano. So I took him as a student. Well, Robby began with his piano lessons and from the beginning I thought it was a hopeless endeavor. As much as Robby tried, he lacked the sense of tone and basic rhythm needed to excel. But he dutifully reviewed his scales and some elementary pieces that I require all my students to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Over the months he tried and tried while I listened and cringed and tried to encourage him. At the end of each weekly lesson he'd always say, "My mom's going to hear me play someday." But it seemed hopeless. He just did not have any inborn ability. I only knew his mother from a distance as she dropped Robby off or waited in her aged car to pick him up. She always waved and smiled but never stopped in.     &nbsp;   Then one day Robby stopped coming to our lessons. I thought about calling him but assumed, because of his lack of ability, that he had decided to pursue something else. I also was glad that he stopped coming. He was a bad advertisement for my teaching! Several weeks later I mailed to the student's homes a flyer on the upcoming recital. To my surprise Robby (who received a flyer) asked me if he could be in the recital. I told him that the recital was for current pupils and because he had dropped out he really did not qualify. He said that his Mom had been sick and unable to take him to piano lessons but he was still practicing. "Miss Hondorf...I've just got to play!" he insisted. I don't know what led me to allow him to play in the recital. Maybe it was his persistence or maybe it was something inside of me saying that it would be all right.     &nbsp;   The night for the recital came. The high school gymnasium was packed with parents, friends and relatives. I put Robby up last in the program before I was to come up and thank all the students and play a finishing piece. I thought that any damage he would do would come at the end of the program and I could always salvage his poor performance through my "curtain closer."     &nbsp;  Well, the recital went off without a hitch. The students had been practicing and it showed. Then Robby came up on stage. His clothes were wrinkled and his hair looked like he'd run an eggbeater through it. "Why didn't he dress up like the other students?" I thought. "Why didn't his mother at least make him comb his hair for this special night?" Robby pulled out the piano bench and he began.     &nbsp;   I was surprised when he announced that he had chosen Mozart's Concerto #21 in C Major. I was not prepared for what I heard next. His fingers were light on the keys, they even danced nimbly on the ivories. He went from pianissimo to fortissimo... from allegro to virtuoso. His suspended chords that Mozart demands were magnificent! Never had I heard Mozart played so well by people his age. After six and a half minutes he ended in a grand crescendo and everyone was on their feet in wild applause.     &nbsp;   Overcome and in tears I ran up on stage and put my arms around Robby in joy. "I've never heard you play like that, Robby! How'd you do it?" Through the microphone Robby explained: "Well Miss Hondorf ...remember I told you my Mom was sick? Well, actually she had cancer and passed away this morning. And well....she was born deaf so tonight was the first time she ever heard me play. I wanted to make it special." There wasn't a dry eye in the house that evening.     &nbsp;   As the people from Social Services led Robby from the stage to be placed into foster care, I &nbsp;noticed that even their eyes were red and puffy and I thought to myself how much richer my life had been for taking Robby as my pupil. No, I've never had a protégée&nbsp;&nbsp;but that night I became a protégée.....of Robby's. He was the teacher and I was the pupil, for it is he that taught me the meaning of perseverance and love and believing in yourself and maybe even taking a chance in someone and you don't know why.     &nbsp;   This is especially meaningful to me since, after serving in Desert Storm, Robby was killed in the senseless bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in April of 1995, where he was reportedly....playing the piano.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice: Do we pass along a spark of the Divine? Or do we pass up that opportunity, and leave the world a bit colder in the process?

       This was sent to me by the same friend that sent me the story "Piano Lessons".&nbsp; Again, I do not know if this is true, but it still will make you think how your actions can affect other people.&nbsp; Here is the story:    &nbsp;  One day when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school.&nbsp; His name was Kyle.&nbsp; It looked like he was carrying all of his books.&nbsp; I thought to myself, “Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday?&nbsp; He must really be a nerd.”  &nbsp;  I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.&nbsp; As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him.&nbsp; They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt.  &nbsp;  His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him.&nbsp; He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes.&nbsp; My heart went out to him.&nbsp; So, I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw a tear in his eye.  &nbsp;  As I handed him his glasses, I said, “Those guys are jerks.&nbsp; They really should get lives.”&nbsp; He looked at me and said, “Hey thanks!”&nbsp; There was a big smile on his face.&nbsp; It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude.  &nbsp;  I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived.&nbsp; As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen him before.&nbsp; He said he had gone to private school before now.  &nbsp;  I would have never hung out with a&nbsp; private school kid before.&nbsp; We talked all the way home, and I carried his books.&nbsp; He turned out to be a pretty cool kid.&nbsp; I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with me and my friends.&nbsp; He said yes.  &nbsp;  We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of him.  &nbsp;  Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again.  &nbsp;  I stopped him and said, “Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday!”&nbsp; He just laughed and handed me half the books.  &nbsp;  Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends.&nbsp; When we were seniors, beginning to think about college, Kyle decided on Georgetown, and I was going to Duke.&nbsp; I knew that we would always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem.&nbsp; He was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship.  &nbsp;  Kyle was valedictorian of our class.&nbsp; I teased him all the time about being a nerd.&nbsp; He had to prepare a speech for graduation.&nbsp; I was so glad it wasn’t me having to get up there and speak.  &nbsp;  Graduation day, I saw Kyle.&nbsp; He looked great.&nbsp; He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school.&nbsp; He filled out and actually looked good in glasses.&nbsp; He had more dates than me, and all the girls loved him.&nbsp; Boy, sometimes I was jealous.  &nbsp;  Today was one of those days.&nbsp; I could see that he was nervous about his speech.&nbsp; So, I smacked him on the back and said,&nbsp; “Hey, big guy, you’ll be great!”&nbsp; He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled.&nbsp; “Thanks,” he said.  &nbsp;  As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began, “Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years.&nbsp; Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach…but mostly your friends.&nbsp; I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them.&nbsp; I am going to tell you a story.”  &nbsp;  I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met.&nbsp; He had planned to kill himself over the weekend.  &nbsp;  He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn’t have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home.&nbsp; He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.&nbsp; “Thankfully, I was saved.&nbsp; My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable.”&nbsp; I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment.&nbsp; I saw his Mom and Dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Not until that moment did I realize its depth.&nbsp; Never underestimate the power of your actions.&nbsp; With one small gesture you can change a person’s life.&nbsp; For better or worse.

       I guess anyone that knows me knows my love for animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;  ALL  animals!!&nbsp; Now, when I say "my love for animals", I don't mean loving them as in&nbsp;grilled,&nbsp;sauteé, or fried!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always had a tender spot in my heart for animals.&nbsp; I have NEVER met an animal I didn't like.&nbsp; I have met many people I don't like, but never ever an animal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;    I have loved animals as far back as I can remember.&nbsp; This caused many controversy at my house while growing up. I remember my dad bringing home a duck.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought it was going to be my new pet.&nbsp; I was petting it and trying to come up with the proper name fitting to a duck.&nbsp; He told me not to get to attached to it.&nbsp; That is when I found out that it was going to be dinner.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cried and cried and told him that I hated him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I begged him not to kill that duck.&nbsp; He explained to me how that duck was going to feed us.&nbsp; I explained to him in my oh so subtle way that there was no way I was going to have any part of eating that duck.&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, while they gorged themselves on that duck, I was eating peanut butter and jelly in the other room.&nbsp; I didn't speak to my dad for a week because of that.&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried over and over to explain to me how people use to have to hunt to put food on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him if I had the choice of killing an animal or starving, then I guess I would have starved.&nbsp; People who tell me "no, you would have killed the animal" obviously do not know me at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sometimes, just sometimes, I wish I hated animals.&nbsp; I wish I could not care&nbsp;about what happens to them because sometimes it hurts so bad when I hear of some of the horror stories that happens to dogs, cats, or just animals in general.&nbsp; I help out with the local humane society   urlLink  www.petsforpeople.org   , and&nbsp;I hear about such stories.&nbsp; I can NOT believe in this day and time how some people treat their animals.&nbsp; Why even have a pet if you are going to mistreat it, starve it, dump it?&nbsp; Since working with the shelter, I have been amazed just how ignorant some people&nbsp;can be.  &nbsp;  When I first went to the local humane society, I left there crying.&nbsp; I had gone to the back and looked at all the unwanted pets.&nbsp; There were dogs, cats, kittens, puppies, and even a pot belly pig.&nbsp; I read the card that is attached to each cage that tells about the animal.&nbsp; On that card, it tells the gender, breed,(if they know), age, and the reason&nbsp;the animal &nbsp;was brought to the shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I went from kennel to kennel, I started reading&nbsp; these cards, but just the section of why each of these animals were brought into the shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the reasons were horrible and not reasons at all.&nbsp;Here are some of the reasons:&nbsp; "moving and could not keep",&nbsp; "kids want a puppy", "got too big", "having a baby, so can't keep", "owners moved and left", "getting married and future spouse does not like animals".&nbsp; This is just some of the reasons.&nbsp; I am sure I am leaving out&nbsp;some.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now, I want to address these one by one.&nbsp; Ok, the first one  "moving and could not keep"  I can not&nbsp;EVEN imagine just moving and not taking my pet.&nbsp; My pet was always part of the family.&nbsp; Would someone just &nbsp;leave their kid?&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I know some people would say that is different, and that I&nbsp;can't compare an animal to a&nbsp;kid.&nbsp; Well, I don't&nbsp; compare the two.&nbsp;There is no comparison and I will &nbsp;leave it at that.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I would find a way to take my pet and for some reason that I couldn't, I would find them a loving home that I knew they would be loved and taken care of just like I would have.  &nbsp;  Second "excuse".&nbsp; That is what I call it because to me, there is no reason for these excuses, but second one "kids want a puppy".&nbsp; HELLOOOOO, does the puppy not grow up????&nbsp; So, getting a puppy will eventually turn into a dog. Do you again get rid of the dog so you can get yet another puppy?&nbsp;&nbsp; This becomes a vicious circle.  &nbsp;  Third "excuse".&nbsp; "Animal got too big"&nbsp; Most intelligent people know that certain breeds of dog will get big.&nbsp; They should find out&nbsp;the type of dog that they are interested in and how big it will get BEFORE they get the dog.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Fourth "excuse". "Having a baby and can't keep".&nbsp; Now, most women in their child bearing years will probably want children one day.&nbsp; That is pretty much the norm for some people, so it stands to reason that BEFORE they get a dog or cat, they should think about this.&nbsp; What is really really sad is that some people will have a dog or cat for 5 or 6 years and then suddenly bring&nbsp;them to the shelter because they decide to have a baby.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is so sad and stressful on the animal.&nbsp; The poor animal &nbsp;has been in this environment for years and suddenly shut up in a kennel.&nbsp; They don't understand what they did or why they have been abandoned.&nbsp; Those to me&nbsp;are the saddest situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are always looking&nbsp;out the kennel looking for their owner.&nbsp; Makes me cry just to think about it.  &nbsp;  Fifth "excuse" which is really there is no excuse for is "owners moved away and left".&nbsp; This appalls me to no end.&nbsp; How can someone do that?&nbsp; A lot of people think it is ok to leave a cat.&nbsp; A cat will survive.&nbsp; They are WRONG.&nbsp; A domesticated cat is a pet.&nbsp; They have no survival instincts.&nbsp; They will die as will a dog who is left without food or water.  &nbsp;    Sixth "excuse". "Getting married and future spouse does not like animals"&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the dumbest one yet.&nbsp; Why marry someone that you do not have something in common with.&nbsp; If they ask you to get rid of your animals, I would think twice about marrying them.&nbsp; First, it shows they are pretty selfish even to ask.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, how can someone NOT like animals!&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;re-read the first and second.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now to be fair, &nbsp;I know some people are allergic.&nbsp; There are pills, shots, and other ways a person with allergies can have animals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know many people that are allergic to cats, and they still have cats.&nbsp; There is always a way.     Now, what does all these excuses have in common?&nbsp; PEOPLE.&nbsp; If a person stops and really thinks and that is the key word,  THINK ,&nbsp;an animal gives you unconditional love.&nbsp; They do not care what you look like, how you talk, what job you have, how your house looks, what kind of car you drive, how old you are, &nbsp;etc.&nbsp; All they care about is being fed and taken care of and they give back so much more.  &nbsp;  Now I do want to praise some of the caring people who bring in strays.&nbsp; A lot of the animals in the shelter are strays that people have found on the side of the road or in a dumpster or wherever a**holes decide to dump them. Those people take time to pick up these animals and bring them to the shelter where at least they have a chance for adoption.&nbsp; Those people are the kind of people who care, and I take my hat off to you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I guess I will get off my soap box now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, I am a calm spirit, but as you can see when it comes to animals, I can get&nbsp;a little radical.&nbsp; They have to have some people to defend them.&nbsp; They can't speak for themselves.  &nbsp;  One day I will write about my dog "Pokie".&nbsp; She is gone now, but she was the love of my life.&nbsp; She died in 1993, but I still get teary-eyed talking about her, so I will save that for another day.&nbsp; I have not gotten a dog since her.&nbsp; She just can't be replaced.&nbsp; One day, when the time is right, I will probably seek out another dog.&nbsp; When I do decide to get another dog, it will be from the shelter, not a breeder.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not ever BUY a dog from people who breed them.&nbsp; A mutt makes the best pet, and there are plenty of them at the shelter that will love you just as much if not more.  &nbsp;  Here are a few sites that I like.&nbsp; I will list more as I find them.  &nbsp;    urlLink  www.petsforpeople.org     &nbsp;    urlLink  www.theanimalrescuesite.com   &nbsp;&nbsp; This site you should go to daily.&nbsp; All you have to do is click on a button and it provides food and water to animals in shelters or sanctuaries.  &nbsp;    urlLink  www.petfinders.com     &nbsp;  All are good sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; Until next time, kiss your dog or hug your cat!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing smells better than puppy breath! :)

       Kinda the story of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born at a normal weight... 6lbs 11oz , but&nbsp; I think that was the only time I was at my ideal weight.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;was always&nbsp; a "chubby" kid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course when you are a child, it is cute and considered baby fat, well it is NOT cute and definitely NOT baby fat any more.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Now, when you talk about dieting and diet plans, I am an expert.&nbsp; I could write books on the subject.&nbsp; I know all there is to know&nbsp;about calories, carbs, the different types of fats, fiber, sugar, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done everything from Weight Watchers to Atkins.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could give lectures on how to eat and lose weight.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one little problem that I have is that I don't listen to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't listen to anyone else either, so I am told, &nbsp;but at least I should be able to listen to myself.&nbsp; After all, I am a smart, intelligent woman, so why can't I do this one simple task...LOSE WEIGHT!!!!     &nbsp;   I have been down the "dieting" road many years.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the first time that I really got serious about&nbsp; losing weight was when one day I got on the scale, and I weighted 278 pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; My brain just kicked in (finally) and said, "hey, this is almost 300 pounds".&nbsp; After that, I started my "diet".&nbsp;&nbsp; I basically just cut back my intake.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, instead of having&nbsp;three hot dogs, I had two.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped eating my late night pizzas, and I stopped buying my one pound bag of M &amp; Ms.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weight started to fall off, but as in all dieting, I reached a plateau.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was down to 160 pounds.&nbsp; I then decided I was small enough to join Weight Watchers without feeling so embarrassed of my size.&nbsp;&nbsp; While in Weight Watchers, I lost another 20 pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was now at 140 and wore a size 11 jeans!&nbsp;&nbsp; Was I happy?&nbsp; No, because I let that scale run my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 5' 3, so in my eyes, 140 pounds was still too much weight.&nbsp; Plus, I never saw myself thinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hold up my size 11 jeans, and they looked small; and I was able to fit in them comfortably, but I still saw myself as being a size 26.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first started buying clothes for my "new body", I went to the mall to try on some clothes.&nbsp; I went to the women's department and tried on a size 44 shirt.&nbsp; It swallowed me.&nbsp; I then tried on a 42, then 40, then 38.&nbsp; All were way too big.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought to myself, "gee, these clothes sure run big" which&nbsp;is kinda ironic because I&nbsp;used to complain how they all ran&nbsp;small.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was just standing there probably looking lost when a sales lady came up to me and asked if she could help me.&nbsp; I told her I couldn't find a size that fit me.&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me that I should try the junior or misses department.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I had never shopped in either one of those departments, so this was all new to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried on shorts, jeans, blouses basically anything that I thought was cute.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was like a kid in a candy store.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   But like so many things, all good things must come to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never did see myself thin.&nbsp; Also, my body must have liked staying at 140 pounds because it would not budge past that weight.&nbsp; Again, I should have been happy, but I was not.&nbsp; Of course, what woman is happy with her weight?&nbsp;&nbsp; I would walk in the mall with my friends and when I would see a person over weight, I would ask them, "am I as big as her"?&nbsp;&nbsp; They would say you are twice as small.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would them find another person and ask them the same question.&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing this about 5 times, I think they got a little tired of it, plus they could not believe I thought I was that big.&nbsp;&nbsp; They finally said when they saw someone that was close to my size, they would point them out to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; A while later, a girl walked by us, and they said, THAT is exactly how big you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at that girl from the front, back, and sideways.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know she probably wondered what I was doing, but I couldn't help it.&nbsp; She was so little.&nbsp; I told my friends that they were obviously blind because there was no way I was that small.&nbsp;&nbsp; My brain never comprehended that my body was different, and I think that was the beginning of my undoing.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I slowly started gaining it all back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hated myself for it, but it was just out of my control.&nbsp; All that hard work and trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had even told myself that if I ever&nbsp;lost weight, I would NEVER gain it back.&nbsp; It was too hard to lose it, but here I was slowing gaining it all back.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Now, personally, I think everyone that is over weight has&nbsp;a certain number that is embedded somewhere way back in their brain.&nbsp; They might not know exactly what that number is or have even given it much thought, but&nbsp; when they get on the scale and see that number that has been&nbsp;lying dormant, I think&nbsp;the brain &nbsp;suddenly comes to life and says ding ding ding.....enough already!!!!&nbsp; That number for me is in high 200s because that is when I decided it was time to do something about my weight.&nbsp; I wish I could have made my brain pick the high 100s, so I wouldn't have so much to lose, but it is set on that number.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got on the scale a week ago today, and I weighted 282.5 pounds.&nbsp; I wanted to cry, but crying won't help.&nbsp; So, my niece, Deanna, and my friend, Dale, and myself all decided we would do Atkins again, but this time, we would DO IT, not just try.&nbsp; As Yoda says, "Do or do not; there is no try".&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So as I sit here today after being on&nbsp;Atkins a whole week, I have lost down to 271.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not fail this time.&nbsp; Your mind is the most powerful gift you can have.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am going to use mine to make me feel thin, so this time around, it will work for me.&nbsp; And I never&nbsp;will&nbsp;to do this all over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of my friends and family, I will continue to lose.&nbsp; I will keep&nbsp;everyone &nbsp;posted on the progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the diet saga continues.........&nbsp;&nbsp;

      US v Reid….Sentencing Hearing: Judge's Sentence & Comment  Remember the guy who got on a plane with a bomb built into his shoe and tried to light it?  Did you know his trial is over?  Did you know he was sentenced?  Did you see/hear any of the judge's comments on TV or Radio?  Didn't think so.  Everyone should hear what the judge had to say.  Ruling by Judge William Young U.S. District Court.  Prior to sentencing, the Judge asked the defendant if he had anything to say.    His response:   After admitting his guilt to the court for the record, Reid also admitted his "allegiance to Osama bin Laden, to Islam, and to the religion of Allah," defiantly stated "I think I ought not apologize for my actions," and told the court "I am at war with your country."  Judge Young then delivered the statement quoted below, a stinging condemnation of Reid in particular and terrorists in general.  January 30, 2003 United States vs. Reid. Judge Young: Mr. Richard C. Reid, hearken now to the sentence the Court imposes upon you. On counts 1, 5 and 6 the Court sentences you to life in prison in the custody of the United States Attorney General. On counts 2, 3, 4 and 7, the Court sentences you to 20 years in prison on each count, the sentence on each count to run consecutive with the other.  That's 80 years. On count 8 the Court sentences you to the mandatory 30 years consecutive to the 80 years just imposed. The Court imposes upon you each of the eight counts a fine of $250,000 for the aggregate fine of $2 million. The Court accepts the government's recommendation with respect to restitution and orders restitution in the amount of $298.17 to Andre Bousquet and $5,784 to American Airlines. The Court imposes upon you the $800 special assessment.  The Court imposes upon you! five years supervised release simply because the law requires it. But the life sentences are real life sentences so I need go no! further.    This is the sentence that is provided for by our statutes. It is a fair and just sentence. It is a righteous sentence. Let me explain this to you. We are not afraid of you or any of your terrorist co-conspirators, Mr. Reid. We are Americans We have been through the fire before. There is all too much war talk here. And I say that to everyone with the utmost respect. Here in this court, where we deal with individuals as individuals, and care for individuals as individuals.   As human beings, we reach out for justice.  You are not an enemy combatant. You! are a terrorist. You are not a soldier in any war. You are a terrorist. To give you that reference, to call you a soldier, gives you far too much stature. Whether it is the officers of government who do it or your attorney who does it, or that happens to be your view, you are a terrorist. And we do not negotiate with terrorists. We do not treat with terrorists. We do not sign documents with terrorists. We hunt them down one by one and bring them to justice.  So war talk is way out of line in this court. You are a big fellow. But you are not that big. You're no warrior. I know warriors. You are a terrorist. A species of criminal guilty of multiple attempted murders. In a very real sense, State Trooper Santiago had it right when you first were taken off that plane and into custody and you wondered where the press and where the TV crews were, and he said you're no big deal.  You're no big deal.  What your counsel, what your able counsel and what the equally able United States attorneys have grappled with and what I have as honestly as I know how tried to grapple with, is why you did something so horrific. What was it that led you here this courtroom today?  I have listened respectfully to what you have to say. And I ask you to search your heart and ask yourself what sort of unfathomable hate led you to do what you are guilty and admit you are guilty of doing. And I have an answer for you. It may not satisfy you. But as I search this entire record, it comes as close to understanding as I know.  It seems to me you hate the one thing that is most precious. You hate our freedom. Our individual freedom. Our individual freedom to live as we choose, to come and go as we choose, to believe or not believe as we individually choose.   Here, in this society, the very winds carry freedom. They carry it everywhere from sea to shining sea. It is because we prize individual freedom so much that you are here in this beautiful courtroom. So that everyone can see, truly see that justice is administered fairly, individually, and discretely. It is for freedom's sake that your lawyers are striving so vigorously on your behalf and have filed appeals, will go on in their representation of you before other judges.  We are about it. Because we all know that the way we treat you, Mr. Reid, is the measure of our own liberties. Make no mistake though. It is yet true that we will bare any burden; pay any price, to preserve our freedoms. Look around this courtroom. Mark it well. The world is not going to long remember what you or I say here. Day after tomorrow it will be forgotten. But this, however, will long endure here in this courtroom and courtrooms all across America, the American people will gather to see that justice, individual justice, justice, not war, individual justice is in fact being done. The very President of the United States through his officers will have to come into courtrooms and lay out evidence on which specific matters can be judged, and juries of citizens will gather to sit and judge that evidence democratically, to mold and shape and refine our sense of justice.  See that flag, Mr. Reid? That's the flag of the United States of America. That flag will fly there long after this is all forgotten. That flag stands for freedom. You know it always will.     Mr. Custody Officer. Stand him down.  So, how much of this Judge's comments did we hear on our TV sets? We need more judges like Judge Young, but that's another subject.  Powerful words that strike home.   God bless America!

      Since this is new to me, I thought I might begin by telling you a little bit about me. Before I start, my boss, who is also my friend, tells me that I type I like I talk, but that is just the way I am.  If I have to type something "official" for work, then I am better at my wording. But for the most part, he is right, I do type like I talk, but then I can't think of a better way for you to get to know me and my personalities.  Notice, I said personalities with a "S".  I have been told I have several, but those are stories for another time.  Now, I won't start at the beginning.  That would take to long, but I do want to give everyone an idea what I am like.    I guess a good place to start is with my name.  My first name is  Jo-Anne, but I hate that name, so I go by my middle name which is Chris or Chrissy.  I answer to both. I am 47 years old. I was born on June 11, 1957 in Beaumont, TX.  Yes, I am a full blooded Texan. My mom was from Waxahachie, TX and my dad was born in Church Point, LA but grew up in Opelousas, LA.  My dad was full blooded Cajun. He could barely speak English when he met my mom.   I have two sisters who are very special to me.  Both are older.  One I haven't seen in a while and the other, I talk to regularly. My parents are both deceased.    I have a BBA and a couple of business certificates from Lamar University in Beaumont, TX.  Most of my days are spent at work.  After I graduated college, which I did not attend until my late twenties, I went to work at a law firm.  It it one of the most prestigious firms in Beaumont, so I was told.  Of course, I was told this by the managing partners of the firm.  This was my first "real" job, and I was very excited.  Well, after about a month, I was in tears daily.  I could not please this attorney.  No matter how hard I tried, it was just not good enough, but I kept telling myself, this is the "most prestigious law firm in Beaumont."  After about a year, I decided that this was not the job for me, so I decided to leave.  Later I was told that I was the 4th person to work for this man in three years.  Seems no one could please him.  Needless to say, this left a bad taste in my mouth about attorneys.  I know not all of them are like he was, but there were about 25 attorneys at this law firm, and I think maybe two would "allow you" to talk to them.  After this, I went to a temp agency to let them find me a job.  I did not want to get another job like I just got out of, so I thought they might find me something more suitable.  Seems like weeks went by and nothing.  I kept telling myself that I have a four-year bachelors degree why doesn't anyone want me.  I was getting so depressed.  Then one day, I had three job offers.  I was so excited, but then also confused.  I had one offer from another "prestigious" law firm, one offer from an electrical testing company, and one offer from one of the local refineries.  I immediately scratched off the law firm.  I still had the bad taste in my mouth from the other one and wasn't quite ready to go through that again.  The other two was a challenge.  One was a temp to hire that only paid barely above minimum wage.  The other paid about $3.00 more per hour, but it was only going to be a temp job for four years.  I kept thinking about the money and also thought maybe after four years they might see how good I was and hire me but then again, they might just say "thank you and seeya".  I decided to go with the temp to hire position which paid less, but then turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made.  In fact, I am still working in that field.  I will tell you more about my job adventures another time.  This pretty much brings me to now.  I love my work and the people I work with.  They are like family to me.  It is a small office, so we get to know each other pretty well.    I hope this has given everyone a little information about me.  I will be writing about my "pet peeves" and my love for animals at a later date.  Also, my major obstacle in my life right now is losing weight.  This is an ongoing thing which I am really trying to work on.  Seems I have been working on it for years.  Again, that is a whole other story.   Hope to see you soon.

       This is for everyone who think animals are dumb.  When I read this, I thought it was so cool and amazing.  My brother-in-law could learn from Koko.   Here is the story about Koko:       Gorilla Seeks Help Using Sign Language     WOODSIDE, Calif. - When Koko the gorilla used the American Sign Language gesture for pain and pointed to her mouth, 12 specialists, including three dentists, sprang into action.    The result? Her first full medical examination in about 20 years, an extracted tooth and a clean bill of health. About a month ago, Koko, a 300-plus-pound ape who became famous for mastering more than 1,000 signs, began telling her handlers at the Gorilla Foundation in Woodside she was in pain. They quickly constructed a pain chart, offering Koko a scale from one to 10.     When Koko started pointing to nine or 10 too often, a dental appointment was made. And because anesthesia would be involved, her handlers used the opportunity to give Koko a head-to-toe exam.  "She's quite articulate," volunteer Johnpaul Slater said. "She'll tell us how bad she's feeling, how bad the pain is. It looked like it was time to do something."  Twelve specialists — a Stanford cardiologist, three anesthesiologists, three dentists, an ear and throat specialist, two veterinarians, a gastroenterologist and a gynecologist — volunteered to help.  "It's not often that we get to work on a celebrity," said Dr. David Liang, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford. "Probably, Koko is less demanding."  The team came to Koko on Sunday, bringing portable X-ray and ultrasound machines. They set up shop at her "apartment," which looks like a remodeled box car, complete with a makeshift toilet, television, DVD player and lots of toys.  After four hours of tests — including a colonoscopy, gynecological exam, dental work, X-rays, and ultrasounds — doctors pronounced her fit.  Koko, who celebrated her 33rd birthday July 4, was due for a checkup. While gorillas in captivity are known to live into their 50s, they are susceptible to heart disease and a thickening of the arteries.  Koko and Ndume, her partner of 11 years (he doesn't "speak"), have been trying unsuccessfully to have a baby, and the doctors thought the checkup could let them know whether she had any biological problems preventing it. She doesn't.  Her teacher, Francine Patterson, was at her side when the anesthesiologist prepared to put her under in the morning, and apparently Koko asked to meet her specialists.  They crowded around her, and Koko, who plays favorites, asked one woman wearing red to come closer. The woman handed her a business card, which Koko promptly ate.  Otherwise, Koko was calm, Liang said.  The Gorilla Foundation has studied gorilla intelligence by teaching American Sign Language to Koko and another gorilla, Michael, who died in 2000.

       I know everyone probably gets tired of me and my animals, but that is just part of my life. As I said previously, I love animals. One in particular is my cat, Turbo.       Turbo is about 8 years old. He is the sweetest cat. Normally, I am not a cat person. I love dogs. I like being greeted when I get home with a happy tail wagging dog with bunches of doggie kisses. I still miss my dog, Pokie, who used to do that. I will tell you about her one day.      For everyone that has a cat, you know a cat very seldom runs up to greet you when you get home. They might allow you to find them and actually pet them, but they normally could careless when you leave or get home. That is just a cat.       Turbo is a little different. I first heard about Turbo from a friend of mine. She called me and said that someone had thrown a kitten out of a car, and it had wondered up to her house. She said she couldn't keep it because she already had three cats, and that they did not like this little kitten. She then tried giving the kitten to her mom who lived next door, but again, she had cats who would beat up on this kitten. Once again, she tried giving it to her sister who lived on the other side of her, still the poor thing would get beat up by cats.       She called me and asked if I knew anyone that wanted a kitten. I told her that I didn't know of anyone right off hand, but I would ask around. She said if I did find someone, let her know because she was taking this kitten to the local vet and hopefully they could find it a home. I told her I would be sure and ask around.       All day long I thought about that poor kitten. In less than one day, he was thrown out of a car, rejected by three families and been beaten up by other cats. I just could not shake this from my mind.       I finally decided to call the vet and see if a home had been found yet for the poor kitty. They told me no. I then talked with the vet who told me it was such a sweet kitten considering what it had been through. It wasn't skittish or scared like most cats who have been through what he had been through. He was very loving and trusting around people. I then asked him if he had given the kitten an exam to make sure he was alright especially after being tossed out of a car. (I won't mention what I would like to do to the person that did that) He said is was is great shape but was a little malnourished, but that was just because he hadn't eaten in a while. I told the vet that I was glad the kitten was ok and hoped he found a home for him soon. I hung up and tried to forget about him.....like I really could.      Well, within the hour, I was at the vet's office. I had to see that kitten. They brought him out to me. He was sooooo cute. He was solid white with the bluest eyes. He was so tiny that he fit in my hand. I noticed he was a little cross-eyed. The vet said that was because he had Siamese in him and that is one of their features. But I didn't care. It was love at first site.      I couldn't stand it. I had to have this kitten. I didn't have a cat carrier because I had just gone to "see" him; I had no intention of taking him home. But I am such a sucker for animals. How does that song go..."just one look...that's all it took..." Well, that's all it took with me. I held my new kitty in my arms as I drove home. He purred so loud and rubbed his head on my chin the whole time. I think he finally knew he was going home.      When I got him home, I put him down on the floor. He was so tiny. He had this huge head and small body. I went out and bought him dry cat food and the canned cat food. His mouth was so little I didn't think he could even eat the dry food. I thought it might break his little teeth. He was that small.       After he ate, he was running all over the place. You could see how happy he was to be inside. He was warm, fed, and loved. That is when he got his name...Turbo. He was like a super charge turbo.       That was 8 years ago. Now, his body has caught up to his head. He weighs about 20 pounds. He has never been outside except that one horrible day when someone tossed him. He is actually afraid of the outside and never even tries to run outside even when the door is left opened.      His day consists of waking me up at 6:00 a.m....even on weekends. I keep dry food down all the time, but he has to have his canned food in the morning and evening. He will only eat 9 Lives tuna and egg or tuna and cheese. He expects his meals on time too. He might be "a little" spoiled, but that's ok. An animals life is so short compared to ours, so I don't mind spoiling him.      He is about the sweetest kitty I have ever seen. It is like he knows I went and rescued him and saved him. He will sit on my lap and purr so loud.       He loves to play, so naturally, I went and bought him tons of toys at Petsmart. I bought him mice with catnip. I bought him a thing to climb on. I bought him a toy with feathers. I bought him rubber balls. I bought him everything I thought a cat would like. Most of them, he just looked at and then looked up at me. I could just hear what he was thinking with his Garfield mind..."and I am suppose to do WHAT with these"????       Then by accident, I found him his two favorite toys. I had just got back from the grocery store and was unloading the groceries. I had dropped an empty brown paper bag on the floor, and he immediately crawled inside. He stayed in that bag for an hour or more. Everytime I would walk past it, he would reach out and try to slash me with his paw and then run back in. His other favorite toy was also an accident. I was opening a new gallon of milk. This is the kind you have to pull off that plastic ring. As I did this, I dropped the ring on the floor. He grabbed it and tossed it all over the kitchen and living room. He loved it. So, his best and favorite toys are an old paper bag and a milk ring.   Wish I had discovered this BEFORE I went and spent all that money at Petsmart.      Turbo has come along ways since that horrible day he was just tossed out like garbage. I don't know what or how a cat thinks, so I don't know if he would even remember something like that. I know he is terrified riding in a car. When I have to take him to the vet, it is a chore. He is so scared. He cries all the way to the vet. I wish I could make him understand, but maybe he does remember what happened to him. Who really knows what they can and cannot think. I know he is more intelligent that some of the people I have encountered. I think he at least knows he is loved and safe and will always have a good home!
