      OK, still not updating.  But hopefully this one will.  Not much happened today.  Just work most of all, unfortunately it's been rather slow this week.  I work as a photo lab manager.  Sales are hurting this week.  Called Vanessa this morning before I left for work.  Unfortunately it seems I always wake her up.  She spent last night just along thinking.  I hope she's thinking about me.  Till next time!

      Well, this is my second post to this although my first post didn't appear.  I wonder why?  Well today I did some good.  I finally finished up fixing a computer for my good friend Deb and delivered it back to her, about 75 miles away.  She had some serious hard drive problems that I'm happy to say that were fixed without any major outflow of cash.  There are some other things I wanted to upgrade on it, but just didn't have time.  I gave the  Body for Life  CD's I made to Vanessa today.  She really wanted to hear them.  I hope she uses them, she needs a lift.  As I said yesterday she's had some troubles with her fiancee, I've honestly told her that from what she's told me that I think it's truly over.  She doesn't want to believe it.  She told me that I was just saying that because I wanted a chance, well that's very true but also being a good friend of hers, I had to tell it as I saw it.  I'll write more as it unfolds.  Till next time!

      Well, work finally picked up a bit today, managed to sell 4 cameras!  I really wanted to see Vanessa tonight and went to see her after I got off work, I also bought a beautiful pink rose for her.  She got kinda emotional about it and I got a couple big hugs.  If anybody is reading this, will you keep this in your prayers that Vanessa and I actually get together?  Take Care! Steve

      Hello all!  I had a workshop in Fairborn, OH today for work.  In case you don't know, I'm a manager of a one hour photo lab here in the Cincinnati area.  It was GREAT!  Learned alot of information that I hopefully will remember when I get back to my store tomorrow.  I'm worried about Vanessa, but it's probably unwarranted.  I haven't spoken with her since Wednesday afternoon before she moved her stuff out of her house.  I know deep in my heart that she needs some time alone, but I also feel that she needs someone to be there for her.  I'm going to wait it out.  She needs support, but when she's ready to accept it will be the best thing.  Till Next Time!

      Just got back from an absolutely wonderful workout!  I did my lower body and aerobic today, although I'm still a bit sore from Monday's upper body workout I enjoyed it alot.  Makes me wonder why I ever got away from my workout, I guess it just got kinda boring but now I have something to look forward to!!!

      Hello all!  Not much going on today except HEAT!  It's very hot here in Cincinnati.  Spoke with Vanessa today and she's moving the stuff out of her house today.  I offered to be there for help and support but she said that she's a big girl and could handle it, I pray she's right.  Till next time! Steve

      Hello again!  I now know that there is a God.  He has helped Vanessa get over her loss.  She now says that she feels free again!  Possibly for the first time in her life.  I'm guessing that this is quite an accomplishment because I've noticed that she's been scared to be alone.  It seems as though she never thought she would never find love if this didn't work out.  She's still going to have some tough times, moving the stuff out of the house and selling it and all, but it's a step in the right direction.  I'm praying now that a relationship that's more than friends will be possible between Vanessa and myself.  But she definitely needs to spend some time alone and enjoy it for a while as well.  I'll wait because she is more than worth it.  See ya soon!

      Well, called Vanessa again today.  She left me an e-mail that she really needed to talk to me but she couldn't get through because my brother was on the internet.  I had a feeling I should have told him to get off, but oh well.  She finally spoke with Brian (her fiancee) and he said that they're officially broken up.  But he said that they might be able to work it out.  Are you confused?  I know I am.  I really need to go get a good workout in, so I think I'm heading that way now.  Till Later!

      Well it's been kind of a rough week.  I've been worried about Vanessa and I rather than focusing on what I really should be doing.  That's letting it all go to God and let him work his will in my life.  Jeez, it's a tough thing to do, but I have to if I want any sanity in my life!!!  I also ask that God take away all my worries about relationships and such.  Other than that I really don't have all that many worries.  It just gets lonely sometimes.

      Sorry it's taken me a while to get back.  This past weekend I helped a friend of mine move.  I was only supposed to be there for one day, but there was way too much to do so I stayed overnight and helped on Sunday too.  Yesterday was pretty good as well, we've picked up this week at work.  We did 75 rolls of film on Monday which is pretty good for us.  I think our daily high is 84 still, but it's close.  Had the day off today, went and helped another store learn how to burn photo CD's.  Then I attempted to fix my toilet (I still don't think it's working right), did laundry and saw a movie, Final Fantasy.  It could have been better, but it was in and of itself pretty good.  Haven't spoken to Vanessa since Friday, I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  Take Care! Steve

      OK, I just had to know.  I finally e-mailed Vanessa and told her that I felt as if something has come between our friendship.  Luckily nothing has, except for the fact that she's going through some hard times.  Will anybody reading this please keep Vanessa in your prayers?  Lets see, been getting busier at work this week, it's odd too because we haven't got any services on sale.  We're not too far behind last weeks counts when we had a decent sale on.  Last night went to dinner with a few friends at "The Music Palace" out in Springdale.  It is a fun place to go, basically while you're eating dinner you're sitting inside a great big organ!  It's truly an experience that you need to have.  Lots of fun.  I also saw American Pie 2, it was actually pretty good.  I liked it better than the first and there aren't too many sequels I like too much.  Take Care! Steve

      Oy, I'm up way too early for working late last night.  I wish the phone didn't ring so loud!  Good news though, we won a contest at work and got 20 tickets to Kentucky Kingdom.  The bad news, they're only for September 22 which happens to be this Saturday.  But the good thing is, I'm off this Saturday!!!  I'll have to see if I can rally some people to go with.  Aside from being rudely awaken by good news it's going to be a pretty good day I hope, albeit rainy!  Talk to ya soon!

      Ok, how come it seems that I never post anything unless Vanessa is mentioned somewhere in it.  Maybe it's her that's causing the most stress in my life.  Maybe it's the not knowing anything about if we're going anywhere.  I so badly want to just leave it and let her make the next move, but that's so hard to do.  What if she doesn't make a move at all?  I don't know.  Well with all the stuff happening in New York this week, work has been tough.  Business has been kinda slow.  I think everybody is watching TV.  But the past couple days have been good, we ran out of flags, so we started making buttons and T-shirts in the photo lab.  They are flying, but then again I don't exactly feel right about it.  But it's not like we've raised the price, and people want them.  I guess it's not as bad as it sounds.  Till next time!

      I still haven't heard from Vanessa, I know what everyones's saying "Get over it, she's not worth it!"  Do you really think if she wasn't worth it that I would be hurting this bad?  I just wish I knew what she's thinking.  More than likely I've hurt her really badly and that's something I  didn't  want to do.  Or maybe she's upset because she hurt me and she doesn't think that I've forgiven her, which I already have if she'd just give me a blasted phone call.  I spent a good portion of last night chatting with some friends over this.  For a while there, I couldn't help but cry.  I really could use a big hug right now.

      Well, took a personal day today.  Just wanted to enjoy the day.  It was beautiful!  Went and worked out and saw a movie.  If you get a chance, see Shrek, it was a good movie and the computer animation is phenomenol!  Well worth seeing.  I still haven't heard from Vanessa.  I sent her a letter telling her how I felt, it wasn't condemning or anything it was just honest.  I expected to hear back from her before now, but I haven't.  Kinda wondering if I will ever hear from her again.  But I know that whatever happens, it's what God has in store for me.  I take comfort in that fact.  Till next time!

      Hello all!  Had a good weekend, went ot Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom with some friends from work.  Had an absolute blast!  I was pretty worn out by the time it was all over, but it was a fun time.  It's not a huge amusement park, but it's a decent size and it wasn't too crowded.  Rode all the roller coasters, even the kiddie one.  Unfortunately only three people from my department were able to go, but we still had a good time.  Those that didn't go stayed on their own volition though, made sure to buy them something from the park as a Thank You.  Take Care!

      Well, another Vanessa thing to tell you about.  Today was one of my team members birthday.  She has been helping out at Vanessa's store for a couple weeks.  Well, I stopped by to see my team member, I had no intention of seeing Vanessa, I was afraid of what I would say to her.  Well, I was waiting around for Judy to go on break and guess who comes walking around the corner.  It wasn't a pleasant meeting either.  Nothing bad was said, after a bit of chit chat I finally asked her why she didn't call me Tuesday and she couldn't give me an answer.  Well, when she was leaving she said that she would send me an e-mail tonight.  I couldn't hear her very well and I asked her to say it again then she said "I'll send you an e-mail tonight, I promise" and crossed her heart.  As of the time of this writing, she still hasn't sent me anything.  I'm not really expecting anything either.

      Couldn't get much sleep last night.  Vanessa is still driving me bonkers!  You would think after all the chances I've given to rekindle a friendship of some kind that if that's what she's truly interested in, she would call.  I think what bothers me the most is that she tells me she's going to do something and then doesn't.

      OK, Things got better then worse.  I spoke with her yesterday morning and she said she would call me or e-mail me and me like the fool I am believed her.  I told her I would be home after 9 pm if she wanted to call.  Well when I got home I decided to watch a movie while waiting, watched the movie until 11 and no call.  Oh well, it's her loss.  She told me that it was my decision and that she still wanted to be friends.  I gave her more than her fair share of chances and she still ignores me.  Oh well, her loss.

      I'm still stewing today.  It takes alot to get me pissed, but Vanessa has managed to do it.  I've got the most open attitude and it takes so much.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I've ever been this pissed off at anybody!!!!!  When I finish the letter I'm writing to her I'll be sure to post it.  Stay tuned, it's gonna be a whopper!

      Yesterday I was happy, but today I'm a bit pissed off.  After thinking about it a bit, Vanessa only e-mailed me after Kathi called her and told her how depressed I was.  It really gets my gall that someone would have the nerve only to contact me after someone asks them to!!!!  I hope Vanessa is reading this.  I know she has the address considering I sent it to her.

      Well, thank God for little birds!  One of my team members called Vanessa at work yesterday despite my asking her not to.  That was one of the sweetest things anybody's ever done for me.  From what Kathi said, it doesn't seem Vanessa is upset with me at all.  As a matter of fact she seemed concerned that I was worried over her.  But anyways, to make a long story short, apparently after Kathi had called her, Vanessa e-mailed me.  I haven't had such a burden lifted off my shoulders in a long time.  She's off Wednesday so hopefull we can get together.  Prayers would be helpful!

      Well, Vanessa told me to get the F out of her life yesterday.  It hurt so much, but then again it was also sort of healing.  It was healing to finally know exactly where I stood, nomatter where that was.  She told me that she heard that I was saying all kinds of lies, as to what these were I don't know.  She did accuse me of something I actually considered though for which I feel horrible.  She's been seeing someone that I kinda know and have heard some horrible stories about, directly from the people involved.  Out of my concern I was considering having them write to her and tell her about him.  To which I did admit that I had thought about, but couldn't do.  She told me that they were almost broken up, "which I'm sure makes you happy".  I told her no I'm not, I just want her to be happy and if she's not happy I wasn't.  Well to make a long story short, I told her that I cared about her.  I told her that although I would like a romantic relationship with her, I'll settle for friendship which is what I said all along.  She told me that I don't know when to give up, well can I deny my feelings or who I am?  She has become a large part of what I am and now it feels like I have a hole in my chest.  I told her that if she ever needed a friend or someone to be with to give me a call, I expected her to say "go to hell" but all she said was OK.  In short Vanessa, if you're reading this I want to apologize for what I've done.  Particularly the part about having a letter written to you.  But you must understand I don't know these "lies" you've heard.  I have said no lies whatsoever and trust me I haven't spoken to John either except for telling him "Have a nice night John."

      Yesterday I was pondering all day what Vanessa must be thinking.  Then last night a friend of mine made things drastically clear for me.  She told me that it doesn't matter what she may or may not be feeling.  What matters is that she said it.  She has made her bed and now she must lie in it.  That helped me through so much I couldn't tell you.  I'm still kinda hurting but it's not nearly as bad now.  Don't get me wrong, I still care for her and I will be here for her when she needs me, but what she said last night holds so much truth.

      OK, I found out today that John actually did make Vanessa call me.  She didn't want to, but he told her that if she didn't break off our friendship that they would be through.  Well, she's a big girl and did make the call.  What am I supposed to do, wait until he hurts her again?  I don't think so.  She has my number and knows where to find me.  If she needs a friend, I'm here for her.  But I refuse to put myself through more agony and pain.

      Well, it's been a week without Vanessa.  This has to be the hardest thing anybody has ever asked me to do in my life.  Is it wrong to love somebody?  Is it wrong to express those feelings?  Is it possible to be madly in love with somebody and still be friends?  Well, in my humble opinion my answers in order are no, no, yes.  It is very possible.  I've been doing it for years, the person who I can turn to with my problems is someone that I'm in love with.  She's also a friend and married.  I just want to talk to Vanessa and discuss everything.  I know we could work something out.

      I'm starting to feel much better although still alone.  The events of the past month are still on my mind almost constantly but I'm learning to smile again.  Halloween is coming quickly and with it one very big picture taking holiday!  Hopefulle we'll be busy.  We've noticed an increase already, maybe this will pull us out of the slump we've been in at work.

      After a bit more thinking last night, I can't really blame Vanessa for the way she treated me.  I was, and still am infatuated with her.  I guess I just pushed a bit too hard.  But that's the way I am, I'm a very emotional guy and when I find something I want, I tend to smother it.  I never meant to hurt Vanessa in any way, but I guess I did without realizing it.  My apologies to you Vanessa for hurting you.  Can you forgive me?

      Just when will the pain end?  Nobody or nothing has ever made me feel this way before.  It's so hard to care for somebody so much and them not respond to you or even want to talk to you!  I told her that I wouldn't e-mail or call her and I will keep that promise but to be honest with you, it's tearing me up!  This is definitely the hardest thing anybody has ever asked me to do.  But I will do it because I care for her.  I know that sounds messed up, but if that's what will make her happy then I'll do it.

Usually the only time I chat with her is right around now.  She wants to meet me!!!  It's odd, but I've never met anybody online that I've really wanted to actually meet anybody I met online.  I was hoping to meet her this weekend, I'm off.  But I have a birthday party I had already agreed to go to on Saturday!  Darn!

I know, it's disgustingly cute, but she's got me hooked!  I still haven't met her face to face, but I really think I'm falling in love with her.  Everytime I talk to her, I get butterflies in my stomach.  I'll keep you informed!

      What started out as a wonderful way to end the week, has turned into a disaster.  Chris called me yesterday and told me that she had gotten a call from home (Wisconson).  Her father was rushed to the hospital.  She drove there, in record time I might add just in time.  He passed away last night.  I ask anybody reading this to please say a prayer for her family in their time of need.

      OK, I haven't blogged in a while.  Tried a couple times but the site was down for security reasons, I fully understand that one.  Last Monday Chris told me she loved me!!!  I was stunned but very happy and relieved because I felt it all along and I feel the same way towards her.  But we still haven't met!  I don't know how to explain it, but meeting Chris in this way just seems more pure than any other.  No worries about looks, more worries about find out about the true self in the person you're chatting with.  In case you may be wondering, yes, I still miss Vanessa now and then.  I told her that I loved her and that will always be and never change.  I also made a promise to her that I would be there for her when she needed me and I fully intend to keep that promise, no matter what has or will transpire between us.  I'm of the belief that a person is not made up by who he or she is, they are made up of all of lifes experiences put together.  Every person one has encountered in their life, no matter how insignificant it may seem makes up who one is and what one will be.  Does that make any sense whatsoever?

      I haven't spoken to Chris in a month.  She couldn't leave her mother thinking that she wanted to replace her.  She said in the last e-mail I got from her that she's finally becoming the woman she knows.  Chris loves her adoptive mother and doesn't want to replace her.  It was all part of the plan that she couldn't speak with anybody because she didn't want her mother to think she was faking it.  I pray she's home soon, I do love her and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.

I have to keep reminding myself that God is in control of all of my life and he will work things out for the best.  But I can't help but wonder what's up with Chris?  I love her more than I can say and I miss her twice that.

      No, I wasn't crazy to think Chris actually cared.  She finally got hold of me on Monday, Yes, she still cares.  She's had some troubles again, but she's doing well and hopefully we'll talk soon.  On another note, I've decided to take the plunge from walking to running.  I  WILL  run a 5K race in the next few months.  Today was my first workout in the training for the race.  It wasn't much, 1 min running and 2 min walking for 7 reps.  But it's a start!!!  Till next time.
