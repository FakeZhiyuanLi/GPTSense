      lol...The Little (Spanish) Pimps.  Nice. Anyways...Marten, you're not the only one stressed.  I think we all are...and everyone in the play is totally needing to be avoided.  So, I understand.  lol, I know my personal reason for being so moody...but ya'll prolly don't care nor want to know.  Yep.  I hope you get un-stressed soon...I miss the old Marten who didn't yell at me for painting the wrong way in stage tech.  :-( SQ(u)EE!

      O yeah, I knew that. I saw that he died on the news. hehe. didn't make name connection, never watched price is right.    Erin is the lead in the play. yay erin! I am sad, i think. maybe im just tired.  I need to do speech. the play is affecting me more than I thought it would.  indirectly, of course.  stress pipes. yarg, you interpret. thinky sleep good, burritos.   Sophia:  "its not you, its me" I appologize for moodiness. I stressy. need a punching bag and a very long nap. stuff is leaky.

      Erin is a senior who is friend of Comstocks, Marten, and Thomas. By the way Nathan, I posted a blank message accidently while trying to edit a former post, so I had to find some way to use it. I wasn't trying to be nasty or anything. Death to Mr. Hall! SQEE!

      Who's Erin?  haha.  Ln has one Native American.  haha.  I find that funny for some reason.  I want to apologize, Marten, for acting like such a...umm...butt-munch?  today.  I don't know what's going on...just some odd hormonal imbalance or something.  Oh well.  Enough about my body's chemistry.  Who's Erin?   SQEE!

      Found a useful website today.  Comparative information on public schools of Indianapolis can be found  urlLink here .  All the vital stats, as they say.  I find it really funny that LN has exactly one Native American student.  I think I know her. You know what annoys me?  Ugly people who like to shout across the computer lab about their social lives to equally ugly people.  Hicks is a good, stereotypical word for them, or maybe white trash.  They like to verbally abuse each other. Marten: Bob Barker?  The "Price is Right" guy?  You are so out of it. Thomas: Point taken. SQEE!

      Who's Robert?  I hope that text thingy works. I hope I remember to do it. I also hope I remember to do my original oratory manuscript. Thomas wrote his in one night. I laugh. Laugh with me its funny. So was BOO!, a bunch of "scary" shorts that LC players perform.      anywhy, I could've sworn either Nathan or Jonah said something about Lara. Maybe it was just Thomas.  Michael said her posts weren't funny. We must all obey the Great Michael!.    Sophia: there wasn't a real poll. um. don't hit me.  or anything.  Jonah:  I want a spork of doom.  Thomas: I can't go another day without central heating.  Nathan: I hope that works.  Lara wont make a very good minion.    Lara:  You can still post, can't you? I knew I forgot something!  Erin: HEY! ERIN! um... YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TIME TO POST RIGHT NOW(oops), SO I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER TELLING YOU TO DO SO!(ewok, be happy)  You know, I could take Lara off just cuz this is a lot of people to have on a blog. The spell check on this prgram didn't know the words ewok, Jonah, or Erin. I thought everyone knew those.

      The results are in for state. I have the scores but not allowed to post 'em. Sorry Jonah. LC got fourth, which is disappointing compared to last year's second place, but I am still happy with a great performance. We got 6th in music and that is what dragged us down. We got 3rd in visual, and 3rd in general effect. Indy regionals and Grand Nationals will be very exciting.  Nathan: I shared your soul with Jonah and it gave me a soar throat :( Jonah: PiE! Huzzah for marching band despite the Protests of Marten and Soph Sophia: When are we gonna get a duo?! By the way, I do not post often because my posts would be pointless if I did. I only post when I have something to say.  SQEE!

      Rest in Peace, Robert Barker.  If all dogs go to heaven, you're gonna have a hard time when they found out who told their owners to spay and nueter them.  Just kidding.  You were a good man, and we hate to lose you.  The price was wrong. I know I've had a lot of Oklahoma titles recently, but it's what I know really well. Marten, go to View, Text size, Medium.  That should solve your problem.  It was a genetics project.  Soph, I likle that name better than Mindless robots and some of the others.  Lara, I'll support you, but only if you agree to be my minion.  Thomas, post more often.  Jonah, you're allergic to souls, remember?  SQEE!

      Marten, was this one of those "Hey, Thomas do you think?" polls? 'Cause Nate and I don't remember being polled either.  As long as I'm posting, it's time for the State report-LN version.  We recieved 6th place, a seemingly bad spot.  In fact, though, we were 2nd place in marching to Avon by 3/4 of a point and third in music.  We were only 6th because we were eighth in general effect, and that could be attributed to our band being very small compared to the others.  This made us too quiet for the dome and ruined the pianissimos at the beginning and end of the show, which contributed to the low effect score.  So really, the score isn't so bad considering what we had against us. We still should have beat Carmel.  But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk.  In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat.  Yay! And Now, Mtto5:  Marten:  Nope, didn't get smaller for me.  Also, don't tell Lara but I'm with you.  Thomas:  Now you write the LC version!  Larry:  Nice Poem. Also, don't tell Marten, but I'm with you. Also also, your new title scheme is Famous Chiropractors.  Have Fun.  Sophia:  I like your poems, too.  I like the second one better.  The first one has a few lines that don't sound poetic enough.  Nathan:  I will eat your soul with my spork of doom.  SQEE!

      Haha...I think this is possibly the stupidest band name I've thought of for this thing.  It's quite possible.  lol.  Anyways...I don't remember the poll either.  And I've gotten over my problem with not being the only girl on here...so I think she should stay!  lol Larry's funny.  Anyways.   Life is pretty boring.  Everyone's sick.  It's dreadful.  I hate being sick.SQEE!

      Did the print suddenly shrink for anyone else? its giving me a headache.  Lara, I apologize, but the polls are in and you've been voted off of the blog. Obviously, you'll still be able to read it and if you have anything good to post you can post it through my name.    68 on what? SQ(u)EE!

      Ok, I've calmed down.  I get fits of rage sometimes; I'm better now.  Plus it was pointed out to me that it's a 68 out of 80, which is actually closer to an 83%.  I'd just seen the 68 and assumed it was a percentage.   I know that's not the actual name of the song, but it makes more sense and I'm lazy.   SQUEE!

      Lisa, since I know you read this, my e-mail has been down since the move (a little over a month).  I can finally recieve messages now, but I can't send them.  Secondly, well, I'll get to that when I can reply to you.  I didn't want you to think I was being petty. Sorry, everyone else.  It's always a little stressful to get a months worth of E-mails all at once, and Lisa's were only slightly less annoying than Amazon.com's: Problem with your billing information.  Your order will be canceled in... 10...9...8...7...6.  Lucky I got to it now.  It still delays my order by 6 frickin' days. Other general complaints: My title scheme is to frickin' hard, Levi hogs the computer too much, and the flickering light above my head is really starting to get annoying.  Oh, and Ms. Knapp can take her 68% and stuff it. (I don't know what she can stuff, it just seemed like the right thing to say.) Errrr..... SQUEE!

      I was at my friend's house and she has this book from the library called the Encyclopedia of Serial Killers. It had all these serial killers and what they did listed and all sorts of creepy sadistic things. Its also had some "symptoms" for phsycopathic/serial killery...ness. There was bedwetting until adolesence as one and animal torture and obsession with fire too.. I like fire (-^^-) lol  Eeww, Marten, that game is gross. Even if it isn't really that graphic its just... =p. And its 6:15 when you come in! 6:15!  Sophia: thnx =D and you're welcome  I can't think of a title scheme so just give me one and I'll stick to it.  SQUEE!

Its called city jumper or sumthin, the object being to jump over sky scrapers, lest ye end up as a pool of blood.

      lol...get it?  Rachael Aull?!  hahaha, man I'm so funny.  Anyways...she's doing speech this year?  SO EXCITING!!!  Thanks you guys for helping me with my poems...lol for those of you who actually commented (cough Lara cough), your comments were really fantastic.  Thanks so much!  And your poem...(trying to think of perfect word here)...wow.  That's all I can think of to say right now.  You know?    Anyways...I don't actually know if it's based purely on the writing or on performance...I'd guess that it's based on the writing since there are other performing categories...but I really don't know!    Gracias, señors/señorita!!  SQEE!

      I'm not much for free verse poetry.  I think it's more of an expression for yourself than for others.  For me it is anyway, its how I vent. Not surprisingly, the only real poems I've written in the last two years or so, class assignments excluded, have been about Laura.  There's one in my other blog.  My problem is, whenever I write a poem I actually like, it's to personal for me to share with anyone.  I find I can't write poetry about something unless I really, deeply, care about it, in which case I can't share it. Getting back to the point, I really can't judge because I just can't get into that form of poetry.  I don't know enough about what makes it 'good' -- seems pretty arbitrary to me.  My question is, do you perform it, or are you being judged purely on the writing? Lara - don't you think Tiny Explosions fits Sophia's title scheme better? Marten - It's Larry.  Rachael's doing speech, and he's offered to help out like our dad is. Secret soul, by the way, is a super cool duet from "Jane Eyre the Musical" SQUEE!

      Alrighty then. My title scheme is just things that have absolutly nothing to do with my post unless of course you dissect it and it might have something to do with it.  About poetry, you have come to the right person. Marten, poetry doesn't have to rhyme, but its still fun to find words that do. Your poems are great already. Believe me I've been published. I personally think that the first draft is usually the best. It shows what your thinking at the exact moment of writing and that is usually the deepest point of that partiular emotion. Here's one of mine that I just wrote Thursday. I was listening to SOAD and I was so tired I didn't  even want to get up and turn off my cd player or my the light. I barely reached for my notebook to write it down:  "Waking Up Is Hard To Do"  5:00 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the large button on top It stops  5:05 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the button Radio still plays I pound harder Radio still plays I retreat back under my comforter Radio talks about  Sex Gays Enhancements Trends Money, money, money Sell, sell, sell Buy, buy, buy I shrink further beneath the comforter I hide I fear to face the cold angry winds outside my bedroom The radio is just a taste of what hides outside my safe haven My heaven  My lounge  My healing  5:20 I mash the button again Radio stops I roll over to doze in my newfound silence Silence.. When all are at peace  5:25 Radio plays automatically I try to shut it out Try to think I try to be at peace No success I wish to die I reconsider my wish I give into the Radio Set me free   SQEE!

      Um, I dont know much about poetry. About all I can say is that its kind of intersting, but it doesnt rhyme. I wonder if i could ever get excited for anything like that.  Maybe opening night of a show I'm involved in somehow is the equivelent. your father?  That would be interesting. Unless of course im wrong, then it might be more interesting.  SQEE!

      Hey guys, my diary won't let me post...so you'll get to give me feedback instead!  lol I wrote two poems (so far) for Project XL and I'd like to know what you think.  I don't think they're the best I've written ever...so...please...be nice.  "Change Over Time"  My 7th Grade Teacher's Favorite phrase used to seem Absurd, abstract.  But now I see, That behind the times, there really has been Change Over Time.  Once the world was dead, dark, desolate, but by dawn there came lights.  Light from the sun, Light from man's brilliance. But these lights Couldn't be relied upon.  So we're ever-searching, ever-wondering: What prompted this Change Over Time?  ~*~ (Insert Title Here…possibly “A Moment”)  The sun rises over a dying cornfield.  Crows take flight awakened by the sudden, blinding light.  Their world has changed in an instant.  One moment forever altering their future.   So, as I said, not the best I’ve ever written.  I think my time when poetry was easy for me is over.  Now I have to work for it.  So this is just the first draft.  Yep.  So please tell me! SQEE!

      I'm really excited about State tomorrow.  The odd thing about that is, I'm not in marching band.  I'm excited like a normal person would be about the World Series or the Super Bowl, or like I would be about the season Premier of Stargate.  I want to see how it turns out.  Anything can happen. I've been forced into doing USX at Connersville.  That gives me about a week to learn how to Extemp. and put together a file with absolutely know help.  To make matters worse, no one knows where last years is (not that it would do us all that much good anyway).  Amar(at least two of you knows him, so I figure he's ok) has quite unexpectedly offered to give me a hand, and I'm grateful, if a bit confused.  His sister donated a bunch of stuff too, but shes actually nice sometimes so it was less surprising.  I still don't have enough.   Marten, guess who's gonna be judging and helping us out at speech meets?  Hint: it's an LN parent you know very well..... SQEE!

      The procrastinator is from thief of time.  It may be paraphrased though, I haven't read it in a while.   Sorry about disappearing regularly at Thomas'.  I was just a bit restless and bored. Had to move around.  Lara: Your title scheme cannot be invisible.  If it was invisible, we would not be able to see your titles.  I will kick you if you do not lower stealth fields.  And technicly, the only way someone passes any class like its nothing is by getting a D.  That proves that it's nothing (important) and its passing. You get no points.

      You know Alex?! OMG he is soo hott! He was in Jazz Band, Honors Chamber, and regular concert orchestra last year at FCV, so everyone knows who he is. Thats why making Jazz Band was so important to me, it makes me feel like I'm really, really good but now I feel like everyone is watching me to see if I'm as good as he is. Now I guess since I'm first chair now, with no practice, I might skip over to the eighth grade orch. if I DO practice...hmm...Or else I'll just be really, really, really good...Or maybe its because the other three are really, really bad...  Marten and Sofa:  You know what'll be really funny?! When I  have Mr. Hall and I pass his class like its nothing. lol but the way you guys are talking I probably wont...poopoo.. SQuEE!

      For those of you who don't know, I'm a section editor for the North Star, our newspaper.  I'm currently overbooked, working on two stories and a page.   Story 1: The Skinny on Wrestling.  Sarah, editor of our quarterly magazine MEOW, had the brilliant idea of taking the two least athletic people on staff, and making them participate in various sports for the magazine.  This eventually led to The Skinny.  In it's final incarnation, Colin Dugdale and I (the aforementioned least athletic people) attend a wrestling (this issue, anyway) practice and observe.  Afterward, we get together with the few of the guys, don the uniforms, and wrestle each other.  Pictures are taken and everyone laughs at us. (Fun gig, eh?)  We've watched the practice, we have to do the stuff and write the story Monday. Story 2: Regime makes (wins, loses, etc.) State.  The other girl in both North Star and Marching Band and I are splitting this story because we're the only two people on staff willing to attend the competition.  Because of the nature of it, we can't even do interviews until the end of Saturday, and we'll write the story on Monday. Page: I'm always responsible for designing the feature page, usually at least a two day proccess.  Because all the reporters with stories on the page got extensions, I haven't been able to start it.  Due: Monday.  So that's my Monday.  My Journalism class will be spent writing the Regime Story, SRT wrestling with Colin, and I'll stay after to design the page.  Or else I'll make the assistant features editor design the page by herself.  I hate having to give up the fun one, though.  The moral of this post:  Don't volunteer to do two stories in one weekend if you also have a page to design and the paper gets sent to press Tuesday! And Now Mtto4  Nathan:  AD&D? All over again? Why not?  Marten:  Where does the procrastinator quote come from?  Lara:  Actually, we have an electric bass in our marching band this year.  Alex Shumard - he's in the pit.  Sophia:  So there is no Matthew Broderick-Nathan Lane version?

Anyways...my friend (the one who burned me the CD and told me to rent the video) told me this morning that the Producers we rented last night was the only one.  I'm super sorry guys...I was looking for the songs.  SORRY!  lol and sorry for yelling so much...ya'll just wouldn't stop talking!  GOSH!

The Dungeons and Dragons thing sounds pretty cool even though I have no idea how to play, but oh well, I'll learn.

      So, I was unpacking the other day, and I came across an old dusty box that I'd mindlessly packed into another box.  I opened it up and found a wealth of stuff from when Levi, Jonah, and I used to play Dungeons and Dragons together -- character sheets, maps, dice, and the old second addition books.  I realized that I really want to get back into it again -- and I'd like to invite you all to join me, Lara included.  I'm telling Tyler Rudd, Paul Simmons, and a few others you don't know about it, and I'm hoping to get together a diverse adventure group of 5 or 6 people.  I volunteer to be dungeon master, but if someone else wants the job, I'm open to different arrangements.  It's a lot of work though.  Don't say no till you've thought about it.  Old fashioned pen and paper RPGs, with the right group of people, can be really fun, and we're going to use 'simplified' rules, so learning the basics should take maybe an hour, hour and a half tops.  It's just an idea right now, but if enough people are interested, it'll end up actually happening. WIGII!

Jonah :  Of course there are other guys!  lol, you didn't seriously think ya'll were the only guys I flirted with!  I can at least think of four others off the top of my head.  And about Claire...I am sorry, but I still think high school relationships are pretty stupid, so I knew ya'll were gonna break up.  It's just a fact of life right now.  But I'm very proud of you for breaking up amicably.  That's always wonderful.  So...support!  Larry :  Haha, my nickname's Sofa, so it's all good.  And, yes, it's only the FCV band room that smells like that.  I actually noticed that while I was there, too!  LC's band room isn't bad at all...you just have to ignore how many sweaty marching band members have practiced in there and it smells perfectly normal!  lol.  BTW:  You aren't considering joining marching band...are you?????  Marten :  You turd muffin!  You didn't say anything about my wonderful couch!!!  lol just kidding...but you still didn't say anything to me.  :-(.  hehe  So...that's it.  See ya'll tonight!!!!!  SO EXCITED!!! SQUEE!

       Nate: Sorry about the cursing, but the first attack was baseless and the second attack was below the belt.   Like my least favorite post of yours, Maria, If you didnt spend so much time on the people, and just got to the point, I wouldn't be complaining. Especially if you didn't even know the people, u didnt have to list them. You could just get to your point of the post.  Jonah:  Well, I didn't know whether or not I should be sorry, you said you broke up on good terms.  Sorry about ignoring your problems.  Lara:  um, wait for the band folks.  I like your bass, don't trade it. And while I could just kick people off left and right, I wouldn't be left with anyone to blog with.  I don't want to do this alone, it would turn into a diary kind of thing with a whole lot of rambling about stuff no one cares about, and i can do that in my head.            Maybe gossip was a bad word.  Rambling about people and events to which we can't relate would be better.  Like when Lara apologized about rambling about some guy who wants to be her boyfreind.  Of course, I should like to know more, in case I have to get my stick out of my closet...

      Above quote is from an interview with the author of I am the Cheese and its a great book and i just think that sounded cool and I want to read all of this other books. Tell me if they're good if you've read any. Sorry for all of the 'and's and stuff I'm kinda tired. I havent posted in a while because Marten ish always on so this might be a little long and boring. Alrighty then, the whole Larry thing started because Thomas didn't want to be called Tommy and he said that if i called him Tommy then he would call me Larry just to bug me but it doesn't bug me too much so I'm trying to get my other friends to call me Larry as well but they either forget or they just don't want to for some reason. =p So far only Pixy calls me that but i think its because he wants to be my boyfriend. wohoo im rambling!! Is it just FCV or do all band rooms smell like socks and old Saltine crackers? I seem to be the only person who gets a little screwed up in the head after jazz band but its probably because everyone else is used to it. I now regret not trading my bass guitar in for the mushroom shaped one. It was really pretty and i could've traded my Westone for it but I didn't so now I want it but I have to wait until next year to trade. BTW whats wrong with gossip?!?! Some gosip can be good gossip! Most everything I say is gossip anyways...  (sry for all the 'I's I didn't capitalize in the haste of writing this post) SQuEE! what are we revolting against my brother for? he could take us all off the member list and we wouldnt be able to post anymore...

      Fighting makes me sad.  I wish my friends would be nice to each other.  It's also kinda sad that in all this turmoil my actual problems are being ignored.  But, then again, this is a blog not an AA meeting, and I get the feeling nobody liked Claire anyway.  I don't know what else to say.  It hurts to come looking for support and instead find your friends cursing at each other about stupid stuff.   And Now, Mtto4*   Marten:  sorry about Claire  I think ? btw, I don't appreciate cursing at all.  I respect your right to use it when you deem it necessary, but keep in mind that I'm opposed to it.  Sophia:  There are other guys!?!?   Thomas:  LC's always been nice to us, in a we're very proud of you but you won't beat us sort of way, so you can see why beating you would be nice.  Nathan:  Maybe you were being a jerk, but I enjoyed the biting sarcastic way you went about it *Mtto# only includes people who have posted since my last post.

      I still this you're being asses as much as I am.  But I don't want this to be what this blog thing is about, so I'm going to try and comply with what you're saying.  With the party tomorrow and everything, I don't want us to be on bad terms.  That doesn't mean I'm agreeing with you.  It just means I'll try and keep the 'gossip' as you call it down, and we'll end this whole argument.  Cause if this isn't fun, theres no point. A few other notes: The spell bowl people: I didn't know any of them either.  All I know about them is that they had their names on the list but didn't sign up.  I was complaining about lack of commitment in general.  I didn't post the dream here because it was all about people you guys don't know.  I'm serious there, I didn't think it would interest you.  Believe it or not, most of what I've said is stuff I've thought would interest you, I mean, if you told me about similar problems I would genuinely be interested, whether I knew the people or not.  That's why it made me so mad. Anyway, it's over now.  Back to our regularly scheduled sillyness. SQEE!

      Nathan, you really were being an ass there.  That was uncalled for.  And really stupid.  You know what Marten and I meant...and I thought your story about your loveseat was quite entertaining.  lol just kidding...but it reminds me of a little couch I had when I was younger...it was blue and you could pull off the seat and it was a toy box!!! it was the coolest thing ever!!!  I loved it!  My dad bought it for me...but the fact that my butt got too big for it, plus the fact that I didn't play with toys anymore caused me to sell it.  Memories.    Anyways, back to whatever.  I just want to read interesting stuff...not stuff about these girls you like who I don't even know.  You know?  I mean...I could write about all the guys I flirt with in a day...and you wouldn't know half of them.  So would you really want to read that?  I didn't think so.  So...there.  lol see you tomorrow!

      ::Come to think of it, Marten, so is the History you're so fond of.:: Ok Nate, what the Fuck? Thats right, youve been enough of an ass to get me to curse on a fucking blog. What the hell are you talking about, this history im so fond of?  Thomas is the history buff, Im just a hereditary reinactor!  I never thought id get this bull shit from you of all people. ::Also, this all comes back to what I said at the Socrates Cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself. Therefore, "gossip" as you call it is actually and important form of self-examination, studying onesself by ones relationships with others. Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants.::  Gossip isnt a form of self examination, its a form of examining others.  Besides, Im really only complaining about solve..problem..maria, And sound of music(a bloody list) the stuff in all that jazz would be funny in moderation, I thought the rating with decimals and everything was funny.  your making this a bigger deal than it is.

      :: prompting Dad (I mention him despite that he's another person, please don't interpret this as 'gossip')::  Nate : Your making an ass of yourself. We all know your dad. but in your post, how do you solve a problem like maria, You just went on about things that had no relevance to anything. we dont know amanda, drew, jane, katherine, and some other people we dont know. Well, we might know katherine, but thats beside the point!  I don't mind you talking about speech meets, or spell bowl, or whatever, but when the whole thing is described in great detail, It gets rather boring, especially when you talk and complain about people who, to the perception of the majority of the blog, don't exist!  Why don't you post your dream here? If it was interesting....   Thomas: Its not censorship.  Its editing. No seriously though, I'm not deleting anything he writes, I'm just complaining about the boring stuff he writes about people unknown.  There is a difference. Some on, read some of those old posts, do you want more like that? The time one, that was interesting.  Sophia: thanks for the support  Jonah:  sorry about claire, I think.   A response to the second attack right now would make the post too long

I hope we beat LN, because I hope that we will beat every band. To Jonah: Glad Claire coming won't be too awkward for you. You know what would be fun? One day where the United States was just a massive anarchy. Would be interesting to see how things would play out. I shall see you all thursday at six.  SQEE!

      Can't we all just get along? Well, I broke up with Claire today.  The break-up doesn't bother me too much; I saw it coming a long time ago, and I did, after all, break it off.  What gets me is her reaction.  I was putting it off because of my fear that she'd be angry or sad, but what she did was much worse.  She smiled, said ok, and was completely unbothered by it.  In fact she almost seemed relieved.  It doesn't do much for my ego, and it confirms my belief that the whole relationship was meaningless.  What a waste of a chunk of my life.  Well, at least people like Kiel can't say I've never had a girlfriend (or for that matter never been to State).  I hope we beat LC just so I can rub it in his face.  That would be rich.  No time for Mtto5 today, too close to last time.  Consider the first line of my post my message to everyone. To Thomas's I add: I was kinda kidding, but whatever. Btw, this doesn't mean Claire won't be there on Thursday.  We "broke up amicably."

      Just to keep this from degrading into a warzone, I'm going to agree not to mention any other people in my blog whatsoever.  Unfortunately, this limits my choice of topic somewhat.  I think I'll talk about one of my favorite inanimate objects: My useless couch. (Technically, it's actually a 'loveseat', but I hesitate to say that, lest my mention of love be interpreted as a complaint that I don't have a girlfriend and hence be percieved of as 'gossip')  It's made of leather and it has a massive gash in it.  I ripped it myself, several years ago, prompting Dad (I mention him despite that he's another person, please don't interpret this as 'gossip') to want to throw it away, but I convinced him to let me put it in my room.  I have since not sat on it once.  This pointless, boring story is exactly what it sounds like, and is typical of how interesting something can be when it contains no people.  But, I wouldn't want you to think of it as 'gossip'. I'd be interested to see your choice of literature.  Pretty much every book I've read and every movie I've seen has contained people you don't know, so I think you'd consider it pretty boring.  Shakespeare?  Terry Pratchett?  Star Wars?  Bunch of 'gossip'.  Come to think of it, Marten, so is the History you're so fond of.  I don't know anyone who lived back then, do you?  By your definition, wouldn't that make it 'gossip'? By the way, I'm gonna need you're guy's help with an Etymology project over fall break, anyone who can come.  We're going to film a scene from Beowulf (an old English bit of 'gossip' about a guy you don't know) and dub it over in old English.  I might decide to use a scene from an old movie though.  I'll keep you posted.  There are other interesting projects going on, many of which I think you'd want to hear about, but since they involve people you don't know, you'd just call them 'gossip'.

      Yeah, well this is what I think of you.  ::points to butt::  so hmph.  I think society is crap and the same goes for your view.  Just kidding.  But at least gossip about people we know.  Otherwise it truly is pointless.  Cuz you're just talking to yourself.  SQEE!

      Marten started the Blog, but only officially.  It was my idea, and was actually started while I was over at his house.  I'm as much responsible for having started it as he is.  Also, this all comes back to what I said at the Socrates Cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself.  Therefore, "gossip" as you call it is actually and important form of self-examination, studying onesself by ones relationships with others.  Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants. And don't go saying it's "more of a musical scene", and yes, there most likely will be a second attack at some point. SQEE!

      lol...kinda like the Shirelles *since that's how you SPELL it and everything* but also having a Marten-esque touch.  I like it.    In reference to the revolt against Marten -I'm with Marten on this one.  He's the one who invited us onto this blog, so it's still officially his.  He made it, so if he doesn't like what you're posting then you need to make another blog for those posts.  Talk about interesting stuff.  Like how hot I am.  :-) Anyways, I got all my money stolen today.  I think it happened before 3rd block.  I'm so sad, that was all the money I'd saved up...$49.  lol, that's not even two allowances...so I just need to wait 2 weeks and I'll have more money than that, but, you know, it's the idea.  Someone stole from me.  That's so sad.  Sorry...I'm traumatized. Anyways (again) Pre-show is fun.  Marten, when is the fall play?  lol...isn't it November 6, 7, and 8?  Cuz I want to invite people to see my StArRiNg RoLe...lol...not...but I don't know when to tell them to come!   Anyways (I need to stop saying that) SO EXCITED ABOUT THURSDAY!!!! SQUEE!

      You'll notice a change from the regular scheme today- my title, while still following the scheme- has nothing to do with the content.  This is because what little content there is doesn't start with D.   Oddly enough Nathan DOES sound like a prep. By contrast, you'll notice I haven't mentioned my girlfriend once on this blog.  Actually that's kinda worrysome. If she's uninvolved enough with my life that I can neglect to mention her for 3 entries, including the one with the first letter of her name as the main letter, I probably don't spend enough time with her.  I've been thinking about that a lot.  I realize that I don't really love her, so I should probably break up with her.  Then when I try to, I realize I really don't want to lose her, and I figure I must love her or atleast like her a lot.  Kind of a vicious cycle, but I'm gonna have to figure it out one way or another.   Anyway, we took the PSATs (pronounced: pissats) today.  How boring.  I had a scary Jolly Rancher experience and ate some cookies, and that's about it.  Oh yeah, and I'm writing about the Regime at State for North Star, and I also designed a killer feature page on Halloween.  I'm becoming quite the trendy designer, if I do say so myself. And Now, MTTO5  Thomas:   Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred.  It'd be funny.  Nathan:  Way to stand up for yourself! You can post whatever the shrell you want.  Marten:  Sorry I just used your word.  Sophia:   You know I'd be swooning if I didn't have a girlfriend.  Lara:   Welcome to the blog.    i33nbS

      I had a really crazy dream last night.  So I've recorded it in my  urlLink dream log . I suggest you read it though, it's very odd. Marten, I'm sorry you don't like my topics, but this is my blog as much as anyone else's.  I don't always like your topics either.  Deal with it. (And I mean that in the nicest way.)   On the plus side, according to my established behavioral patterns, I should be out of the swooning "I need a girlfriend" phase in a week or so, when I will brief enter into the "women are evil" phase and be back at good, old, apathetic me by mid-November.

          Actually, there is no problem named Maria.  The problems are Amanda, Anna, Zach, and Chris, the people who DIDN'T SHOW UP for spell bowl, causing us to have to FORFIET THREE WHOLE ROUNDS!     Err.......... The worst part is, when ar last person finished in Round 7, we were in the lead!  If we'd continued at our average score, we would've come in second.  As it is, we came in Ninth, out of twelve, which isn't bad for a group that forfeited a third of the competition.  It's just a little irksome.    Seriously, if other people are depending on you, the least you can do is tell someone you can't be there  in time to find a replacement.  It's sickening.  I'm never talking to Amanda again.  This, combined with Romeo and Juliet, is just too much.    Ok, what else.  We got room assignments today for Branson.  Kevin Wack, David Meyer, and Drew Klages.  At the least, none of them have any serious hygiene problem.  They're not bad people either.  It'll be fun.    Now, to swooning.  Both Jane and Katherine have sisters a year apart from us who are both more attractive and more interesting then them.  So why am I stuck in class with the bad ones?  Oh well.  At least I've got both Webbs.   SQEE!

Nathan-I totally recognized Timon's voice on the CD...I just didn't know that Nathan Lane was him!!!  I thought it was Billy Crystal...doesn't he sound like that?!  But, yeah, I recognized his voice and also Matthew Broderick's voice from when I saw The Music Man.  That's a good musical, as well. Jonah-Congrats on State!  And even though Marching Band IS a death cult, I'm still proud of you guys' beating Carmel.  That's quite a feat!  YAY!

           Wow.  Lots to say.  First off, Sophia: you're safe.  On the off chance any of us try to swoon over Lara, I think Marten would get mad.  It's unlikely anyway.  At any rate, I'm going to do all my swooning at my other blog, since thats what its for.      Second, I've thought of two more broadway songs about time, so we can continue that discussion whenever you want to.         Third, Sophia -- did you know that two voice actors on The Lion King have been in The Producers?  Nathan Lane, who did the voice of Timon, played in the Movie, and Mathew Broderick, who played the adult Simba is in the revival.  Just thought I'd throw that out there.  On that note, did you know Zazu the annoying bird was played by Rowan Atkinson?  Mr. Bean?  I had no idea, myself.      Fourth, Why are my posts always so much longer than everyone elses?  You guys need to write more.        Fifth, It's Walky is an incredibly well, written, well drawn web-comic, and I highly recommend it to anyone.  It's nice to finally learn about Jasons past, and this plotline seems sure to provide action, romance, and maybe a little background info on the cheese.  Plus Joe and Dina's Battleship is gonna be really cool.  I hope they don't just forget about it.  It's also nice to see a webcomic deal seriously with the issue of religion.     Sixth, You're adding webcomics to my list of taboo topics now, aren't you?     Seventh, Dune! The Musical! is coming right along, and I will show those of you who haven't already seen them the two sample songs at the party.     Eighth, what the frell does SQEE mean?  Is it some in joke I'm not in on? Wish me luck at Spell Bowl tomorrow!  Bye, ya'll! SQEE!

              Sophia, we are swooning.(or at leats I am)  We're just very good at not letting that sort of thing interfere with other stuff.  As for Lara, your too young for socrates cafe, and Sophia will once again be the only girl on here if you don't explain your title. They have to have some kind of scheme.  Don't forget to capitalize the first letters of your sentences, thats important to. About the only grammar related thing we really pay attention to here.       I'd congradulate Jonah on state if I didn't despise the utter control of marching band, though at this point, drama is nearly as controlling. My hair is gone. Woe is me.    SQ(u)EE!

I should probably stop talking now.  But, yeah!!! Let's rent The Producers!!!  That's such a smart idea!  I'm so glad I thought of it!!!  lol...where's that from?  The Lion King, maybe?

      So much to talk about.  First of all, I just realized that I am really, really sexy.  Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy.  I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants.  I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic.  Actually not really, I just wanted to give Sophia an idea of what her comments would seem like to other people.  Anyway, Socrates cafe is awesome, and Ms. Guthrie is so cool! If she weren't ten years older and already married, I would be in love with her.  I I thrive off discussion, and coffee makes me hyper and the combination made it so I couldn't get to sleep until 1:30 (and I tried to wrestle Thomas's dog, Taz, who is on a permanent coffee high).  Of course, it didn't help that Levi's friends were over watching Leeches! (the new worst movie ever) untill 1:00.  We threw him a surprise party; it was lots of fun.   Why not rent the Producers at the Moby Dick party? (Just thought I'd throw that out) In other news... WE"RE GOIN" TO STATE!!! WOOO!! WE BEAT CARMEL!!! YEAH!! It was really crazy after we found out, and everyone was hugging everyone else.  This girl comes up and hugs me, then she's like "Hi, I'm Ashley." We'd never even met before!  It was very funny.   And now, messages to the other four. Thomas:  Join the Blog!  Nathan: Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall. Sophia: As far as the hair thing goes, you're so hot I never noticed your hair.  Or your face.  Or lower body. (j/k) Marten: Shrell is not my word, dram is.  Shrell is all yours.  SQEE!

      OMG...it's so freaky that you want to see The Producers.  I totally just got that CD from my friend...he burned it for me and told me it was REALLY good.  lol and it is...it's superb.  It's hilarious!!!  SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER!!!  omg, you soooo need to see it.  Anyway...Alice Laramore LOVES Pippin...so that's obviously a pretty good one. Anyway anyway, you thought I was hotter with long hair?  Really?  You're not the first guy to say that, actually...I just don't see it.  I thought I was kinda too normal-looking back then.  Sorry...we can stop talking about me and my hotness.  I just realized a few hours ago that I was simply irrisistable (lol just kidding) and wanted to share it with the world!!!   SQEE!

      What happened to the interesting time topic? Not that i mind thinking of how hot Sophia is. Although, I wanna-screw-her hot is somewhat relative, depending on the guy.  But, yes, Sophia, you are so hot it literally burns.  Good thing i have quite a bit of self control.        Ha! I knew nate only went to socrates cafe for the girls!  but once again, i must complain about your topic.  who cares what musicals you want to see? I mean, if you chose one, and talked about it, sure.  But you just have a bloody list! What the shrell? I dont care if thats jonah's word   SQEE!

           There are so many musicals I want to see.  I've been browsing for information on "The Pajama Game" and I've come across a whole bunch of shows I'd never heard of that looked really good.  I'm gonna start getting them out of the library, though.  As soon as I have time.  The list so far: Rent (just missed it -- Ergh!) The Last Five Years (Just ordered the soundtrack from Amazon) How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying Jeckyll and Hyde Blood Brothers The Civil War A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum The Producers Miss Saigon Little Shop of Horrors (Heard the Soundtrack -- Loved it) Pippin        There are more, I just don't have time to list them right now         Sophia: You're very unobservant.  I personally thought you were hotter back when you had long hair (I know you hated yourself then, but that doesn't change it).  I think something in between would be best for you though.  About like mine (Styled differently, of course).  But you're still really hot.  You know who else is really hot?  Christen Neary.  Not gonna elaborate anymore on that here, though. One more thing: I'm now on the spell bowl team.  We're doomed. SQEE!

            That is kind of important. I've thought of time a lot. Not entirely like that, but it makes sense.  But any one can percieve time like that. how would it affect how they interacted with people who percieved time linearly?        I thought of time being percieved as longer or shorter in diferent circumstances.  Like in a car.  If you spend more than four hours in a moving vehicle, whenever you were got into the vehicle in the first place feels like yesterday.  And what about days that feel like other days? like when thursday feels like monday, and sunday feels like wednesday.and you know how time flies when your having fun?  It doesnt always do that, but it almost always slows down when your bored. SQEE!

               Since you say my comments are inane, I've decided to address an issue of the utmost importance.  Something that's really been bothering me lately.  Linear time makes no sense.            Most of you have probably grown up with linear time, and don't know it any other way, so you'd probably be opposed to changing it.  And I'm not suggesting everyone be aware of all points in time simultaneously.  That would be mass chaos.  What I'm suggesting is that it makes more sense for people to control their own personal time.         Whether we want it to or not, the next thing to happen will happen next.  Friday will come after Thursday.  Two o'clock will come after one o'clock.  Causes will have immediate effects.  What if you had control over this.  Imagine if you could decide that you'd be in SRT than in biology class.  SRT would still come after biology, but you would perceive it as coming before.  If you put something in your pocket in Biology class, it would still be there in SRT.  It's just your perception of events that would change.        You may complain this would cause paradoxes.  Well, it would.  But only if used irresponsibly.  If overused it would get quite confusing.  The other danger would be the thrill seeker who lived every fun moment immediately and then had only sorrow for the rest of his life.  But, if used correctly, this ability would completely eliminate stress.       Do you get any of this, or am I just rambling?  If you do, that's great.  If not, it just goes to prove that everything I think about that's not inane is insanely complicated.       Bad puns excluded, of course.

      Yes jonah, I will add your link when im not lazy.  haha ur in marching band.  You are quitting next year, are you not?  I tried to convince Kiel, but now hes gonna try out for section leader, or cult leader.  poor soul.       Your next point is a valid one. I made it on the post that never was, because my comp screwed up and deleted it.  Hey, readers that I didnt send a link to, find someway to tell us ur reading it!  Kinda locks, most blogs have a little spot for comments or notes.    i think we should start an online socratic cafe even if no ones reading it. It will be fun.  Hurray philosophy.  nate, Ur topics are all gossipy, or about people.  Other than the fact that we dont know these people, It is kind of the lowest form of conversational intelligence         we love you too, Sophia.  See? evil people can change over time.  Don't diss ur own species so much. though thats a bit of an exageration, u werent evil, we were just ahead of our time.  While I do approve of what our country is supposed to stand for, I can agree that weve become decadent and desesitized as a society, and the fact that we blame the media doesn't help.  It only keeps us from doing anything about the real cause of the proble, and that is that kids are raising themselves.  but i skipped a bunch in that, and it prolly doesnt make too much sense. I agree with schuck kinda, Were gonna fall like Rome soon. Prolly by the end of this century, if not quicker  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional.

      Well, that was Thursday.   Oddly enough, it felt like a Friday.  That happens sometimes, but I must be careful not to think tomorrow a Saturday, lest I miss school.  Or, in this case, show up at 5:00.  Yes, I'll be at my school at 5:00 on Saturday because the esteemed Low Brass captians have decided that just because we need to be at school at 7:00, it's no reason not to come two hopurs early for a Low Brass Breakfast.  But it's oK, I can sleep on the bus.  Speaking of marching band, today was the last rehearsal before regionals, and I think we're gonna make state.  Unless somebody screws up. Which brings me to my next point.  Or rather, doesn't bring me to my next point because it has nothing to do with marching band.  And the point is: For whom are we writing this anyway?  For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience?  I need to know how much background to provide in an entry.  Also, I think I'm going to shamelessly advertise my other blog,  urlLink Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog.  It's not a blog like this one, I have Compendium and  urlLink What Kind of Day Has it Been?  for that.  Tales is a story blog, in which I'm writing an amusing story about toasters at the moment.  However, other stories will follow.  And now, messages to the other four. Thomas: JOIN THE BLOG! Nathan: I thought you weren't supposed to use this blog for ranting about your love life. Sophia: I never thought of you as any of those things, but then again I didn't really notice that you didn't want to be associated with us, so I was probably just naive and/or in denial. Marten: If you can't remember it it can't have been too important.  Also, if you could add TftosotC (what an abbreviation!) to the links in the blog, that'd be cool.   All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.  I'll say.

         Whoah.  I'm exhausted.  Choir concert today.  I'm hesitant to say anything about it for fear of that sounding like the most important.  We did well.  I, on the other hand, made a complete ass of myself onstage.  But apparently Mrs. Dingman is the only one who noticed.  I don't know.     One good thing about being in the prestigious top three choirs is you get to watch the Hip Street girls change clothes.  Of course, their overall hotness level went down a notch when Danielle left, but it's still at, like, 9.6 out of 10. Which means Laura must be, like, a 22, as I realized I'd actually rather look at her fully clothed then watch them in their underwear.      Kudos to Millenium, they improved dramatically since Thursday.  They've still got a long way to go, though.  But so do we all.      Shiny red doesn't become me.  Just had to say that, cause it's so true.  I have a whole new respect for Lexi; she got my hair to stay back and up.  The combination of that and the suit, of course, made me look like a colombian drug lord, but that's life.  Lexi is also I have to say the most attractive African American girl I've ever met.  Not to say black girls aren't attractive, just that it's better than saying "Fourth hottest girl". (By the way, number 3 is actually Mexican, so don't tell me I'm being racist).  She's a senior, though, so just about as off-limits as Tiffany.  Oh well.    Thank you for your comments Soph, they made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but not fuzzy like when you eat mold.  In the words of Pete Abrahms, "And that's it.  I'm going back to bed."

      Lol...funny stuff.  I love this name.  HAHAHA!!  Cuz it's like, Moby Dick...but they're "punk" so they wear Dickies.  HAHAHA!!! FUNNY!!!   Okay, maybe not.   Oh well.  Anyways...MOBY DICK PARTY!!!  Rent isn't on video...so we're gonna watch Moby Dick!  I'm so excited.  Yayness.  Anyways...hmmm...Marten and I had fun cleaning out paint buckets in stage tech, didn't we? Do you want to know what I think is highly ironic?  The fact that when I knew you guys before...I thought you were so stupid.  I thought you were incredibly dorky and I didn't want to be associated with you because that was how I was in 4th and 5th grade...but now, here I am, truly happy and having the best time with three of the coolest guys that I've known for the longest and never imagined being friends with.  That was quite a long sentence.  But anyway...I realize now that you guys were the awesome ones and I was the stupid, idiotic, moronic, immature (shall I continue?), butt-headed, (okay, blanking on more mean words I can use to describe my 4th/5th grade self) one.  So I just wanted to say...I think...that you guys are the awesome-est and I'm just so happy that I finally got to know you and realized how incredible you are. So, I'm done with my testimony.

      I can dance!  It takes me forever to learn, but I am now without a doubt not the worst dancer in the choir.  I practiced with various combinations of Laura, Chad, Amy, and Megan today for a total of about two hours, and as a whole, we no longer look like crap.  Millenium is a different story.  If they don't improve by next year, I'm going to shoot myself or join band.  Freshman aren't supposed to be perfect, but these guys are absurd.  There is on e guy with any facial expression whatsoever.  Problem is, he's the worst dancer of the lot.   And that's saying a lot.  Most of them are two or three beats behind, and their movements are either lazy and half-hearted or jerky and disconnected.  Or both.  Oh, and they're not singing either.  Basically, if this is the future of the Lawrence North choir program, we're screwed.  Oh, and by the way, I'm not putting the name of the show in the title anymore.  It's too cluttered.   I'll add it to the end of the post.  If anyone wants to know, this one's from Songs for a New World.  And I deleted the stupid signature line.  It's tacky and blatantly untrue.

And I didn't even know you were leaving or anything?  Goodness gracious.  Anyways...great band name, eh?  Thought of it last night while I was half-asleep.  I thought it was quite an inspiration.  lol cuz the initials would be DBW and you could say it like "Debuwah".  lol Like a retarded Deborah.  That's my mom's name!  Isn't that the uber-peachiest?

Laura, if by some bizarre chance you end up reading this, don't click that link, even if you already know everything that's in it.  I refrained from reading your online diary when I found it.

But now, it's just like...What was I thinking??   So anyway.  Enough about that.  I don't really know why I'm writing in here; there isn't really that much to write about.  Cept I've got a little crush on a friend and I can't like him because I don't want to screw up our friendship.  How much does that suck?  lol cuz I think it sucks mucho.  Anyways...au revoir!

      Well, My E-mail's finally up, so I can do this blog thing for real now.  First off, Muppet Movies now count as musicals. So do Disney Movies.  Because I said so.  Second off, Sophia is not my girlfriend either, and while I was thinking about remedying that about a week ago, I decided against it.   As my friend Glennie said, when you can't drive and you go to different schools, 20 minutes is a long distance relationship.  She is really hot though.  I don't have a girlfriend.  Never have.  Don't particularly want one either.  More on that in a later post.  My next post is gonna give you a little backgound on my romantic history.  It'll help you understand my attitude towards girls in general, and Laura in particular, as I suspect she'll come up again.  Plus it's a great read.  I'll probably post it on Wednsday.  Well, that's all for now.  Word to all my homies!  Peace!  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

And moshing has developed some muscles in my legs that I didn't know existed!  It's painful, yet exciting, because I just thought my legs were devoid of muscle.  Haha.

        ah, jeez, now even my dad yells at the tv when the footblah team is doing badly.  I just dont see the point of some spectator sports.  Especially racing.  see the cars. see the cars go around in circles.  second to that is baseball. some times there are cool catches, slides, but reall, its just a guy hitting a ball and running a square. excuse me, diamond.      the weird thing is, my little sister enjoys watching me play video games.  I dont mind either, if the player is good, and the game a cool design and graphics, like Zone of the Enders.  this could be why one of my more favorible sports to eatch is tennis, for its similarity to pong.  That could be a new revenue, competitive professional video gaming. I hope so, because its a definate net if none of my other career possibilities fall through.

      Thanks a lot.  Now you've ruined my whole air of mystery.  You know chicks dig an air of mystery.  Now I need a new schtick (it's yiddish, and not at all what it sounds like).

Anyway, if that happens, I'm taking yours.  Your identity, I mean.  It's only fair, since you caused me to lose mine.  I'll be Marten Dollinger, and you can be some weird internet creep.

      Hey, um, I had to write something right now so I could set up this blog. I wasn't ready for this part yet, as evinced by the peanuts.  Im serious about that ya know. Ive had a weird craving for peanuts.  I think i might be pegnant.  That would suck.  I mean, did u ever see that episode of enterprise when tucker got pregnant cuz he touched that wierd blue stuff? and I dont even have a girls freind.  watch out for typos by the way.  Im offering a small bounty for them.    All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

      Nurr, Michael.  I can say "lol" as much as I'd like.  You want me to prove it?  Because I will!  I bought a new CD!  It's VEGGIETALES!  Silly Songs With Larry!  OMG, I love it so much!  And there's a remix...that's absolutely FANTASTIC.  It's so great.  Sorry, I'm just so excited about my new children's CD.    It's okay! I had Subway!

      I know that I post too much, but I still had stuff to say and didn't want to add to my previous post that was almost Tolstoy-Length.  1.) I italicize  Claire  because I happen to think that  Claire  is a hussy who isn't good enough for Jonah. I have no problem with Ashley though. She seems nice. Unlike  Claire .  2.) I hate it when people say LOL. It just really annoys me. I think Sophia has said it in the past, and I'm not trying to tell her how to post but I think it is one of those phrases that can only be said by girls or gay men. Not that there's anything wrong with that... However this poses a quandary, cause Sophia's a girl Not that there's anything wrong with that...  3.) I think that Sufferage killed Chivalry. I also think that if you have the right to vote, serve in the army, and have equal rights, you can open your own damn door. Unless the guy arrives at the door first. If the girl arrives first it's not my problem.  4.) I have created forums.  At this point, we really don't need them since no-one but us reads the blog. But I believe that discussion is good and that forums are better.  So tell everyone you know. Tell your friends. Tell everyone who has an IQ over room temperature. And Send them to our site. Write it down for them. It doesn't matter, just get them here. And then get them  urlLink here   Have problems? Objections? Rude remarks? See your friendly comments page for details on getting those to me.

      Let's start off with this. Shut up Nathan. Caffeine's the only way to fly. It's my anti-real drug. And Tommy Schlamme was executive producer of The West Wing and Sports Night. And that is officially calling anyone named Thomas who I think I could beat up. A Thomas larger than me will remain Thomas.  I have to admit that the mini JournalCon thing was fun. Jonah "Fun Stuff" Comstock and Marten "Grizzly Bear" Dollenger came over. I was constantly distracted by Marten's disturbing mustache and medium long hair. I think I may either be the first to rise up and say it or absolutely wrong, but Marten really looks bad with long hair. Or maybe he just looks bad all the time. In my opinion, if you're going to look bad, then you might as well look bad with a low maintenance haircut. He asked on one occasion sometime between the time where Marten attacked me and the time(s) Jonah was being vaguely gay "Why am I so Goddamn Poor?" My response? "Too much money on haircare products." I often had an urge to beat him over the head with a frozen butter braid and drag his limp unconcious body to Great Clips. If you are opposed to this, don't make post about it. Just use the comment buttons that I created. For the Glark to Marten's Sars. Another allusion you don't understand, courtesy of Michael Christie.  Right now I'm listening to the credits music from Pirates of the Caribbean, the best [live action] movie of the summer. Disney actually threw in the live action comment in its DVD commercials. To distinguish it from their other best movie of the summer (and the most popular DVD of all time) Finding Nemo. Both of the movies were movies that the more I think about them, the more I like them.  Erin - You watch Joan of Arcadia? That's so cool! I love that show! Were you here when I used "Anticlimatic means you're against the weather" in a convorsation.  And speaking of which I have another one coming soon. I bandied around the idea of making Erin my mindless love-bot, but realized she would blow an artery if I actually did. Hopefully she will just find this hilarious and not hunt me down and kill me dead. As actors are wont to do.   By the way, I have made up my mind that my improv skills will vastly improve if I add various phrases to my preparation. To date I have added the following "They got eaten by monkeys" and "Get Out. Now."  That's all for now. If you had half as much fun reading this post than I had writing it, well I've had twice as much fun writing it than you have reading it. I'm Casey McCall, and you're watching Sports Night

      The Star Trek date went amazingly well.  I got both Nana Visitor and Jason Carter - who I had no idea was going to be there- to sing to us.  I also got an autograph and a death threat from Jason (Luckily for me, he didn't have a Minbari fighting pike with him at the time).  I did not buy her a tribble, although she did buy a tribble for her mom.  Ashley told me she likes me better than her birds, then Richard Biggs (B5's Dr. Franklin) asked me if she was my Lady.  Anyway, with all that, we're together now.  You can meet her at the speech meet on the tenth, or I  might  bring her to youth group sometime. Micheal: That only makes it funny when you're on Caffiene, which most of us aren't at the moment.  Also, what the heck does Schlammes mean? Jonah: I have a statue of Emperor Palpatine.  Would you like to borrow it?  Oh, and cornblog is a stupid idea. Lara: Where can I get a copy of your book?  And will you sign it?

      lol, ehh...it's 1:15 right now...so I don't think I'm gonna come.  I might plan on coming to the JournalCon, though.  That does sound a bit interesting.  hehe.  anyways...I'm going to go get beautified cuz my mom's paying.  lol, I sound like such a barfy girl.  Okay, I'm just going to stop.   Have a good day, everyone!  I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

      That, I have just discovered, is the tagline of Joan of Arcadia. In speaking of which, Michael, did you see the previews for next week's episode at the end last night? My commentary was... But she's OLD! ("She" being Mary Steenburgen.)  I'm glad there are no sweeps in real life. I wouldn't be able to stand November, February, and May. Jonah: Tear down a statue of Emperor Palpatine. That will always work. I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

      Sofa - If with only one hour to go you can provide snacks and figure out where I live, than yes you can come. I really didn't anticipate this turning into a JournalCon though, people  Jonah - Tommy! S c hlamme's! Mommy! is brilliant. As is Ma Hornsbeck.  The first is funny 'cause of internal rhyme the latter because I was on massive amounts of caffeine when I wrote it  I don't like it. I don't like it at all.  Me Either. This Signatures Sucks!

      The title refers to the Blitzblog, and the confusion it surely raises among readers.  It's also a fun bit of alliteration.  So, first thing - the beginning of the conversation involved Michael commenting that I smelled weird, which is what 'point taken' was in reply to, as well as all of the shower stuff.   Second, all formatting was lost in the posting, but when Michael says 'with Claire?' (7:40:49) it should read 'with  Claire? ' folowing the unwritten rule that Michael cannot mention Claire's name without italics. Third- The correct terms for referring to people's mothers: Mine and Nathan's- Carol, Jonah's Mommy, or Ms. Hornbeck (Not Ma Comstock or any variant) Thomas's- Mrs. Fowler, Momas, or Mhomas (Not Tommy! Shlamme's! Mommy!) Michael's- Mrs. Christie, possibly Bonnie Fourth- There is no fourth item.  Anyway, news from the other side of the corndog.  I know how to use the template well enough to not only add links, but add a totally seperate item to the sidebar - Stories.  This will be lots of fun when there's actually more than one. But Marten- this is proof that you should give me mod power so I can make cool, trendy stuff for our sidebar, or just add my blog to the links.  Also, Who thinks I should change the name to 'Tales from the other side of the cornblog?'  And Now, a long awaited Mtto8:  Nathan:  *snicker*  Michael:  Loved the West Wing comparisons. Btw, did you notice how I've been spelling your name correctly?  Erin:  Yay! The war is over.   I feel like we should be tearing down a statue of someone.  Lara:  Welcome back, how's the book selling?  Thomas:  Actually, Spinachs do have livers.  Atleast, they cloned one that does in a secret lab in Montana.  Sophia:  Michael's already mad enough at me for inviting two additional people, so it's his call.  I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Well maybe a little.  But it smells wierd.

      Ah, Lara's back.  I liked the book tour thing.  If you post again it has to have little static sound effects in it. that can be your compensation for not having a title scheme.  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Erin - I insist on getting you a gift certificate, at least. I have Christmas/JournalCon gifts for everybody in mind already and will work on getting them purchased.  Lara - I'm sorry, I have to ask. What time is it in Johannesburg? 'Cause you must not know that Erin and I have buried the metaphorical hatchet.   Jonah - I'm Casey McCall and this is Dan Rydell and you're watching Sports Night on CSC so stick around.  Nathan - Aww... Nerds in love. Maybe you could propose to her. You would give her 'the one ring' as your wedding ring, then you would buy a spaceship and adopt blobby aliens of some kind and then get some pet tribbles.*  Marten - Sorry your thanksgiving sucked. Mine didn't. Read about it here at What Kind of Day Has It Been. Or not. Depending on whether I'm sitting in the office updating or watching a rerun of the pilot of Joan of Arcadia. Probably the latter.  Thomas - I think he died. Just my opinion. I heard his name at LC mentioned. They wanted him to come down to the dean's office for messages. Maybe his mom picked him up and they moved to Sri Lanka.  Sophia - Refrigerator Box? Cool.  Also regarding the webcomic comparison. I really don't know what you're talking about, so I'll put it in terms that I understand  Marten's omnipotence and wisdom qualify him as Jed Bartlet. Erin is the tall attractive press secretary CJ Cregg. I am the lovable, but still annoying Deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman. Jonah is Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director, whereas Nathan is Toby Ziegler, Communications Director. Oh and Sophia is Donna, who is Josh's assistant. Lara is Mandy, who was a major player in the beginning but was never heard from again. Thomas is the aging chief of staff Leo McGarry.  Cut me out of the loop, will ya...  *This was meant to be something said to provoke laughter, otherwise known as a joke. Just don't want Erin to think I be dissin' Nathan.*  *This was also a joke, where I made a blatant attempt to state the obvious. Please don't hurt me.

      Sorry I haven't posted in so long you guys, but you know how it is with an older brother hogging the computer day in and day out...maybe you don't then.    Welcome to the blog Michael and Erin! Stop fighting its buggering me.  I don't know why but I don't feel too talkative right about now.  What did I write anyways?  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      I just asked Ashley to a Star Trek convention.  I don't really know why, it just seemed like a good idea at the time.  I saw the article in the paper, realized it was the same time as we were going to lunch and then.. it just sort of fell into place.  In retrospect, it seems really crazy.  I mean, she watches Star Trek, but she's not as big a fan as me.  Still, she said yes.  I hope it works out; there's no going back now.   And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      Thanks, Michael, but an end to hostilities is more than enough for me. I'm sorry for being so... well, bitchy. Okay, everybody, it's officially over. You can all come out of the bomb shelters now. (Group hug.) Marten: How can I stay mad at you for more than ten seconds? As Magrat Garlick herself would say: "Um." I hope everybody had a great Thanksgiving! I know I did. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Erin, I sincerely apologize. I realized that on this day of thanksgiving that my remarks and behavior was inappropriate. I would like to bridge the gap between us by purchasing you two tickets to "One Man Star Wars" in Chicago. I can't provide lodging or transportion, but Expedia frequently has good deals. The show is playing at The Noble Fool theatre and is playing January 1st and 3rd. It is probably playing more in the future beyond that but Ticketmaster has no information. Provide dates, and if tickets are available they're yours.

      Of course, Nate's usual luck with girls would qualify him as Sam, so I guess Jonah is Torg. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Nate, I think you would be the nerd who gets caught up in everything Sophia would be the insane beauty, Erin, would be, um, Queen Magrat.  I know thats irrelevent.  Erin: um, sorry, I figured once you had told him it would be alright, I thought it might help the situation in general if he knew exactly what the problem was.  Woohoo! Nates got a date! I claim it as a personal victory that had nothing to do with me.  See above exclamation! Jonah has updated the toaster story! Another personal victory. All points revert to me. I dont think Lara counts as a character in this little webcomic, as she no longer exists other than an odd gag about a book tour in a random location.  Its thanksgiving, and I am in the last place I want to be, but its good anyway cuz Matt's good at painting models. He's working on Tau right now, only nathan or jonah will know what I mean, but who cares?  Hey Thomas! Find something interesting and post about it! I want to see that catchy little title scheme again. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Michael and Erin--I really hope you guys are finished because this fighting is getting very tiresome.    So anyways, HAPPY THANKSGIVING everyone!  OOOH!! AND GUESS WHAT!!!  I have a refrigerator box in my bedroom now!  I'm so excited!!! :D!  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      One last thing to Michael: For one thing, you kept nagging about subject lines and the way people did their convorsations. As far as "widespread" goes, at the time Marten notified you of my "angry letter," Marten, Thomas, Sophia, and I think Nathan (I'm not sure about the others) were all getting fed up with it as well. They didn't put it in any form of print; the communication was strictly vocal. I'm tired now and I'm going to bed. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      JOSH: [comes out of his office] Victory is mine! Victory is mine! Great day in the morning people. Victory is mine! DONNA: Good morning, Josh. JOSH: I drink from the keg of glory, Donna. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land. DONNA: It’s gonna be an unbearable day. -The West Wing "Post Hoc, Propter Ergo Hoc."  Heh Heh Heh...forgot about the "Quivering mass of indecision".  Erin, Also just want to ask, where exactly did I tell you how to post on the blog. Just show me. And believe me, if I never exchange posts with you again, it won't be soon enough. And I'm "widespread desire for you to moderate your habits"? Erin, what are you talking about. Marten has no problem. Nor do Jonah, Nathan, Thomas (I don't think...), Sophia or Lara. So unless you have split personality I don't really see the "widespread desire".   Done People. The Erin Problem is solved. Unless this post gives her (and then Marten) an anyerism I'll see y'all next week.

      By the way, everybody have a happy Thanksgiving!  I'm going as far as McCordsville before the arduous journey to my grandmother's house, which is around the corner from mine. Also, Camelot at Footlite rocked. --- "Morgan le Fay! Can you hear me? Am I near your invisible castle?" Nathan: Yay for you! It seems you are certainly a lucky fellow. Sit Ubu, Sit.

      Ahem. Yes, Michael, I did read the whole thing. After being awed by your brilliant mockery of my typos (I don't know-- Are we in sixth grade?) and amazed by how full of yourself you really are, I have only a few things to say. I don't care what you say in your convorsations. I don't care what you want to make up about Rob Lowe and shoes. But it is neither your place nor your right to call me a "quivering mass of indecision" or to instruct me or anyone else as to correct posting on the blog. You don't seem to have taken to that treatment yourself. And I'm interested that you had to go to an outside source to find sufficient means of mocking me. While we're on that subject, Marten, I'm curious to know exactly why you chose to share a private email with someone else without my permission-- with, in fact, my having asked you not to. I'm sorry if it's getting mean, but you're the one who told me to start it.  On a closing note, I apologize for the inconvenience to fellow bloggers. But I have no intention of moving this elsewhere, as I have no intention of being involved in it nearly so long as such a commitment would imply. I, for one, have better things to do with my time than trade insults on a website set aside for that purpose. I have no problem with both of us remaining on the blog so long as you know of the widespread desire for you to moderate your habits. If we are agreed in that regard, then let's all just move on. That's about all I have to say about that. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Well, Marten, a pair of girls succeded where you failed:  they have successfully gotten me over Laura.  Heather was, of course, in on it.  Plus, then I found the perfect actually attainable girl and asked her out.  We have absolutely everything in common.  She's even a Babylon 5 fan!  What more could I want?  It actually makes the break seem like a bad thing, just cause it's a time during which we wont see each other when we normally would.     Her friends are always trying to get her a boyfriend, and now that she's found a guy who likes her without their help they won't leave us alone, so we're keeping it a secret at LN, just to spite them.  There's my love life update, hope it doesn't bore you to much. Michael: Why were you calling Erin non-jewish?  It seems like sort of a bizarre insult. Jonah: If this is a web-comic, I know Erin's the insane beauty(Oasis, Margaret, sort of Gwynn, Sal), Lara's the wishy-washy younger sister who only shows up occasionally (Min, Lilly, I know there are more), and Marten's the brilliant, but mysterious blonde (Riff, Fooker, Roger).  So who's the hapless Nerd who gets caught up in everything?  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      I really do not mean to post often, In fact "Enemies" has been my first post over one word in five days. I also move to take the Blog War into a seperate website. I've got an extra one, me and Erin will battle it out there and the winner shall return to Compendium victorious. And as anyone who has seen "Posse Comitatus" knows, Victorious in war shall be made Glorious in peace.   Jonah - I really wish you would post more frequently as you would know that Marten and I have resolved the posting issue, in a calm and resolved manner. Yes, I know. You're all shocked. Michael used diplomatic resources to resove an issue rather than just slitting the offending persons throat.  Erin - I wait for your reply. I hope you consider yourself a worthy opponant. I also hope you had the stomach to finish my post and did not just e-mail Marten in a "hissy-fit" of epic proportions. I also have to say, that quite frankly I don't give a damn if you are a senior. Just means you'll probably be gone next year anyway.  Gratias Tibi Ago Domine will be up Friday  Until next time, I'm Michael Christie, and your ring "The Enemy Within" on CoS. Stay tuned for comedy in the form of "Smack the Pony".

      Bug's have ears?  Begun this Blog War has.  Insert Fanfare.  Is there anything else? If there is, It should be entertaining instead of just mean.   Jonah's right about the whole webcomic thing.  Michael's our own Bun-Bun, only no switch blade.   Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      You're both right. Michael, yes, you've singled out arrogance and meanness (but in a good natured way) as your niche on the blog.  And, as every good webcomic teaches us, every group of good guys needs an ambiguously evil character.  So, we put up with you and don't take offense.  In fact we enjoy your presence. HOWEVER, the mean guy is not the main character, and many feel you are taking over the blog by posting too much.  And you didn't preface this niche, so Erin, who doesn't know you, obviously thought you were just an asshole (pardon my crude slang).   So, Micheal be your own person, but less often, and Erin, don't ake anything he says seriously.  If he says something that really offends you, don't tell Marten, tell him.  He'll probably apologize.  Otherwise I'll beat him up.  I've probably oversimplified, but that's my two cents. To everyone else who has dissappeared in the midst of all this, come back and do like always.  If you don't want to become involved in a conflict, just ignore it and post normal stuff.  The world needn't stop for Erin and Michael.  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Erin,  My response is in two parts, you paranoid shiksta feminista. First the part where I mock you mercilessly, then the other part. Keep reading. If you can’t scroll down any farther, then close your eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better.  Yeah, it's been a week or so and Michael Christie is still getting on my nerves. [A week? Honey, that’s like seconds in Michael Time! I’ve been getting on people’s nerves for years! It’s part of my incendiary charm. –Michael] I don't want to be negative, [Little Late for that, don’t you think? –Michael] but I hope you realize he is taking over your blog and I would like to know just who the hell he thinks he is. [Sultan of Neptune! –Michael]  Well, I'm not sure if I was the only one who actually wrote angry letters or not. [Yeah, You really were –Michael] I don't think you would rat me out, [Rat me out? Are we in Sixth Grade? –Michael]  but if you want to, let me do it. Let me turn myself in. [Guilty concience, huh? –Michael] In a public exhibition [I believe you mean ‘forum’, the phrase is ‘in a public forum’ –Michael] where I can at least tell him where he is welcome to go. [Chicago? The Ivory Coast?–Michael] He might enjoy his arrogance [Yeah…I really do –Michael], but others don't. [Actually, they kind of do too…Once again part of my incendiary charm. --Michael] Maybe it would help if I knew him in person, but I don't and he doesn't know me. [See below… -Michael] No matter how much he thinks he does and assumes he is welcome to be an ass to me. [I’m an ass to everybody. –Michael] I've had about enough of that for today. [Aww…Sad… --Michael] And he knows it was me anyhow. I know he knows. [Yep, absolutely correct –Michael] Perhaps it was the Huttese that gave me away. [Nope you were the only one who doesn’t know me and it’s common knowledge that to know me is to love me. Just ask Sophia. –Michael] It might as well be out in the open if he's going to ask you to reveal that information—not something a nice person would ask you to do, if you ask me— and if he's going to stay and wants to be hostile to somebody. [ 	 Erin if you were truly offended by my conversations, then well, I think you are as dumb as most of the kids in my Biology class. Convorsations are meant to be taken lightly, and are not a real indication of a persons true being. My convorsations implied that you were bitchy and had a secret thing for Rob Lowe. I don’t actually think that you are bitchy or have a thing for Rob Lowe. I did not mean to offend you. I never knew that you were offended until I got Marten’s message. I pretty much knew it was you, because everyone else knows me, and knows that I’m obnoxious and sort of an ass sometimes, but other times I’m as cute as a little bug’s ear. You just need to realize that I have the maturity of a first grader, and that being sarcastic and mean to you, It just means I like you.

      Michael: As I have been given the go-ahead, I'll save you the trouble of pulling this out of Marten. Yes, as you probably suspected, it was I who wrote the angry letters, though I was not the only one who was angry. Nonetheless, I will answer your particular challenge. And since I have bridged this gap, I may as well provide a translation to my earlier Huttese comment. It means, "The last fool who called me that got his antennae stuffed down his throat. Do you feel lucky, punk?" To that I will add: Kee baatu-baatu. (You bother me.) Kava doompa D'emperiolo stoopa. (You are a low-down Imperial fool.) What? You think it's easy being the Queen? Now, I don't know you, Michael, and you don't know me. But nobody around here appreciates your arrogance but you, and the minute Marten gently tried to inform you of this, you threw a little hissy fit. To put it briefly, I don't like the way you treat Marten, and I don't like the way you refer to others. You are free to "mock me mercilessly," as you put it, but know that I am willing to match you blow for blow, and that I frankly don't care much about what you have to say and thus have little concern for your lack of mercy. I hesitate to pull rank, but... Coughsophomorecough. In conclusion, I cite a quote referring, in case it is unclear, to a certain place over Slice way in Lancre, conveniently located between a Rock and a Hard Place:  "Stuck it up your jumper, sir. Stick it, in fact, up your jumper. Named after Colonel Henri Jumper, I believe. A useful woolen garment akin to a light-weight sweater, sir, which, if I recall correctly, was named after Regimental Sergeant Major Sweat. That, sir, is where you may stick it." -Lieutenant Blouse, Monstrous Regiment by Terry Pratchett  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

It was nice.  kinda.  lol.   So I'm feeling kinda random.

      I have a new worst day ever story.  My Day with Day.  Most of you know Daniel, or at least have seen him.  I'm gonna give you the short version I gave Sasha when she asked how the movie went.(slightly extended)  We went the wrong way, we got back on track,we arrived half an hour late, we walked around trying to think of something to do, I let a hot girl tell me what to do so we nearly got killed by three thug-looking guys at The House,we decided to go home, the car broke down, the car started again, we got terribly lost (again) and ended up 28 miles out side the city, then we (finally) went home.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      Ok fine. I was wrong about the thomas thing. But still, your compendium to WKoDhiB post ratio was a bit unbalanced. And thats no reason to kick me off! youre over-reacting.   And you were taking over the blog.  Well, this kinda sucks. Im back to not having any contact whatsoever with Michael, and he hates me for it.

      Well, My titles always have a tiny connection.  You get to feel smart if you find it.      I was cleaning my room yesterday, and it was practically an archaeological expedition, only without nazis and hot British women. There were a few bits of alien technology; I put them up for sale on Ebay.  Anywho, among the artifacts, I found an old health assignment. It was letter I was supposed to deliver to someone who made a difference in our lives, and mine was full of synicism and young martenesque wit that brought a tear to my eye and laughter to my heart.  Dear Andrew,          In health we have to write to someone who had a big impact on our life, and i chose you. We're writing these things for recognition. You know, why they matter in our lives. We figure if more people knew that they were important, we would have less people committing suicide, or something.         The main reason i chose you is because you are a loyal friend. No matter what I did, you would always try to help, or give me encouragement. Nothing I did would matter, you would always be my friend. I hope it can stay that way. I also chose you because when I get mad I can punch you in the stomach without hurting you... Kidding!         Because of all of the above, I present you with this cheap blue ribbon. Remember, it's the thought that counts. I want you to give the other ribbon to someone who made a difference to you, then explain what the ribbon is for. If you don't, I'll have no choice but to not know about it. But please, don't make me resort to stupidity.                                  Your friend,                                          Marten Dollinger, your future lord and master, as soon as the world acknowleges his global control  ha, good times.  That was in seventh grade. Boy have I changed. mmmyep....  anywho, Michael: I have been getting angry letters about you.  It seems like your taking over the blog.  You need to calm down a bit, I've noticed that you don't post on WKoDhiB as often as you used to, and here I see atleast 2 of your posts between everyone elses. I think maybe you've already scared Thomas away, he hasn't posted since October. Maybe you can lower the post rate and arrogance level just a bit? Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

      Michael's titles always fit the title scheme, but generally have nothing to do with the post.  That's why he never has trouble with his title scheme.  Since he's so experienced at all this, I've decided to follow his lead.  I'll still try to think up sensical titles when I can, but otherwise, total randomness!  It's better than no title at all. Erin: Either one, since I know parodies are what you're best at.  I started a "Look Down" parody about Marvin, but it just wasn't working at all, so I've moved on. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.

      I DO want to be Queen of the Penguins!  And now, "The Lady of Shalott" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. As a limerick. There once was a girl from Shalott Who fell in love with Lancelot At the end of the day In a barge down she lay And floated out to Camelot  Yay! I am glad last week is over.   Fanfiction recommendation of the week ("You might not care, but I do."): "A Moment in Time" a Star Wars fic on fanfiction.net by Kazzy. It's only 11 chapters long. It's about a not-dead Padme and her twins hiding from the Empire. Very moving and true to the characters, even when they don't do what you want them to. And to boot, it has the Naberries in it! They yell and give hugs! And make food, of course. You know what happened to the only person who ever left that house hungry...   Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!

Nathan: Thomas, talking in the third person just isn't hip anymore Micheal: Like you are, ghetto boy!  And why is my name spelled like that.

      Math sucks.  I've just figured out that if it weren't for math, my GPa would be a 3.6 something.  I'm getting a D in Allgebra II now.  I've never gotten a D on a report card and all be damned if I'm gonna start now. Well, the play is over.  Sasha and I broke up, and I don't really care.  It's hard to say which one of us ended it.   I don't know what Randall's problem is.  He was cast as Lord Montague and Lord Capulets understudy, but Capulet quit.  We worked with him on his diction, but when he got out there it all disappeared.  Jazz show Friday.  Come see it.  I have a duet with Heather Haywood.  It will be fun.  Hip street's performing too, and so is the Jazz band.  Oh, and there's swing dancing.  And jazz.  Lot's of Jazz.  Have I mentioned Jazz?  Unfortunately, I already used All That Jazz. One of my IYC/Speech friends(Amanda, Soph, if you want to know) saw Levi's duo and asked me about the "cute guy with the goatee".  That cracks me up. That last post had a title.  I don't know what happened to it.  Plus my title scheme is way harder than any of yours, so cut me some slack. Michael, as much as I enjoy your posts, you're making way too many.  Try not to post three in a row. Marten, even if we'd had a tech crew, we wouldn't have had backdrops.  Mrs. Means thinks they're tacky. Jonah, I think more profession's should do that.  I'm going to make a movie about Janitors who fight evil blobs of Dirt. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?   No it's not. it's Larry.

      What on earth are you talking about Jonah!?!!!  About your last message?!  And I think that you should make one of your movies be  "Indiana Jonah and the Raiders of Nathan's Ark" so you can include your brother.  hahahahahaa.  We need more archeologists...let them think that all of them are incredibly hot and that the work is interesting...we might learn something!    And I never said I wrote the Mr. T comparison!!!  I agreed with Marten!  Hmmm.  Not sure yet about the JournalCon yet.  Ya'll are still pretty strange.  Do I have to do a conversation?  Cuz it's gonna be super dooper pooper scooper random if I do.  So mleh. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

      Creepy.  I could hear Mrs. Horrigan's voice in that convorsation.  Jomah, I did do the Mr. T comparison. Those points belong to me.  You have no settings tab because you lack administrative power.  You need to level up before you can purchase that skill.  Why do you need it, anyway? Michael's only got it because its complicated to teach me how to make links over aim.  I'm making one of my next two posts my unofficial tenth post.  The other one will have my convorsation.    Yar!

      Micheal, what did Laurence say about textual montages? Anyway, these convorsations intrigue me.  Are they a Michael thing, or are we allowed to try our hand? Cause it could be fun...  Anyway, I've decided to make a series of movies: Indiana Jonah and the Raiders of Noah's Ark Indiana Jonah and the Temple of DOOMHOUSE and Indiana Jonah and the Second-to-Last Crusade We should do one for XL.    Speaking of which, the media has desensitized the public to the boringness of archeology.  Tomb Raider teaches us that it's a feild full of incredibly sexy women and fighting bad guys.  Indiana Jones teaches us that it's exciting and dangerous.  Stargate teaches us that every artifact you find is a piece of still working alien technology.  This is what young people entering the field expect to find.  What do they do when they find it's mostly just digging up odd-shaped rocks and guessing what they used to be?  I think someone needs to make a film and/or video game about real archeology. As far as my title today goes, it's a line from Moby Dick the musical, unless the line is actually "My men may call it madness." Either way, this one works for me. And Now MttO6 Michael: Either date works for me, I think.  Also, it's Sluggy Freelance Marten: I have no settings tab.  Find out why. Thomas: Congrats on GrandNats. Nate: Good work on the play. Erin: Ooh, it is a penguin Soph: You still haven't answer my last message! Also, the Mr. T comparison was very funny.  You get points.  Yar!

      Hey guys!  Fixed my name so ya'll could figure it out.  lol.  Okay, I feel  kinda  bad about saying this, but,   ROMEO AND JULIET WAS THE FUNNIEST PLAY I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!  Watching Daniel Day as Mercutio...oh my goodness, I had no idea that he was supposed to be so flamboyantly gay!  I'm glad Daniel brought it to my attention.    Nathan, you were really funny as the old man!  Never really figured out who you were supposed to be...but you cracked me up nonetheless!  And as Friar Lawrence, you were great.  I'm really proud that you could memorize those lines...lol I have enough trouble memorizing NORMAL English, let alone OLDE ENGLISH!  Haha, Lord Capulet was the funniest.  Whenever he'd talk...I'd lean over to Kelly and be like..."Did you understand anything he just said?"  And she'd be like, "I have no idea."  lol cuz it sounded like all he was saying ::add lots of dramatic inflections, yet still sounding like a drill sargeant:: "blebleblehblehblehblehbleh."  I really thought he should be a drill sargeant...he'd be good at that.  Shoot, is it spelled sergeant?  I'm confused.  And completely exhausted.  OOOOOOOO GUESS WHO PLACED IN BOTH HER SPEECH ROUNDS TODAY!!!!  I bet you'll NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS GUESS!!!!!!!  Well, actually, Nathan will...cuz he was there...yay speech!  So I'll just tell you.  ME!!!  I PLACED 10TH IN PROSE AND 4TH IN OI!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Okay, that's enough excitement for this issue of Sofa's insane slap-happy hour, please stay tuned for the next episode!

      I would rather like to know what happened to the titles there.  Technical difficulty? Its just those two.    Michael, you would have enjoyed Romeo and Julliett one way or another.  Daniel Day was incredible as Mercutio.  Everything else was fun to make fun of. No offense to nate, mostly it was the tech that made me laugh, and lord capulet's porky-like speech.  And at one point he reminded me of Mr. T.   i pitty the foo who dont marry paris on thursday   As for JournalCon, either date is fine for me, unless one of them is the Chicago trip with Thomas.  I dont like lemon poppyseed.  I demand blueberry.  I think we should watch old batman movies with Adam West.  It makes me laugh.   Erin:  Nicole is an alias.  That's Sophia.  Yar!

      Does Michael not know she's in the blog?  Is she not in it anymore?  Am I in a parallel realitly where she no longer exists? (Come to think of it, I didn't see her after the play with the rest of the Dollingers.)  If the latter is the case, and you all say "Lara Who!?!" then the answer is "Never mind, she doesn't exist here." Anyway, We made Grand Nats Semis.  Unfortunately, we have the first draw and must be at school at 5:00, so I think I'm going to bed.  A few select messages tonight, with no bolding. Soph: Michael's already the funniest, so soon after the extravaganza!?! Jeez! Michael:  Thomas has the best title scheme ever.  Don't be dissin it. Thomas: When you're living in a DOOM HOUSE at the end of the millenium, You're what you own.  Discuss.  Yar! This Be a Superball!... Or Be it!?!?     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?... Or Is It? Dum dum dum

      That quote from Wyrd Sisters in honor of Romeo and Juliet, which I am going to see tonight. Break a leg. Nate, I look forward to seeing you in tights. (I think it's possible that I have seen too many of my male friends in tights, what with Marten in the talent show last year and Levi's Cpt. Character.) But geez-- you were home at 8:47? That's not a proper Hell Week! I want to borrow My Ishmael when you're done if I may. Nicole- yes, I will never forget me dancing in my slip and make-up to Chicago in the dressing room, either. :) That was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole play because, well, how often do we get to do that in real life? hehe... Next week I'm going to figure out the deal with my title scheme. Be patient with me till then.  In other news, I got a college application turned in this week! Go me! Yar!

      It's true, Nathan.  The grass is always greener on the other side ::insert witty quip here::.  I'm too lazy to think of a worthy witty quip, so you get to do it yourselves.  Yay.  If I misspell stuff, it's because I can't see because I'm not wearing my glasses, so you are forewarned.  Or maybe I'm just too lazy to press backspace.  Anyways...don'e really know what I was going to say now that I've gotten this far.    Michael, you are the funniest person on this blog.  I really enjoy your posts.

      Great example of the grass being greener on the other side:  When I couldn't get a girlfriend, it was like my one goal in life.  Now that I have one, I really want to not have one.  Or have one who I actually see on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, I can't bare to have her mad at me during the show, so I have to wait on that.    Michael, at least you do improv.  Mrs. Britton hates it.  She won't do any, at all.  And choosing your own monologue isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially since the character has to be close to our own age and the same sex.  I'm doing Peter Wiggin from Ender's Game, btw.  I like being sadistic and manipulative. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

      Well, it's the aptly named Hell week.  Having a girlfriend their made it a little better, but she's gotten kind of weird lately and she flirts with Daniel too much.  My time on stage is too scattered.  I don't have long blocks of time offstage.  The good thing is I only have to wear tights for two scenes.  They're not comfy. On a totally different note, I highly encourage you to read  Ishmael  by Daniel Quinn.  I cannot stress enough how important I think it is that everyone read this book.  I'm working on the sequel (parallel novel) and it's not bad, but the first is just overwhelming, and totally defies description.  Read it, then you'll know why.  That'll also explain what the title of this post means.  Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

      I don't really forget; wouldn't YOU all want to listen to a band with this title?!  I know I sure would!    Michael -Oh my goodness, boy, you are really funny.  I just thought you were a weirdo before...now I realize that you're a FUNNY weirdo!  WELCOME TO THE CLUB!!!  (the funny weirdo club and the blog club)  ooh, do you wanna know what would be so cool?!  If we started a club at school for all the people in this blog (cept the Comstocks, of course, unless they want to get bussed over from LN during random SRTs).  I don't know what we'd do exactly...but it'd still be fun!   Erin -lol I will never forget you dancing in your slip and make-up in the dresing room to that exact song (Chicago-title-entry).  And I super-hate days where I would be perfectly content dropping dead.  Marten -You're worried about me "going out" with Larry?  Lol, the "quotes" are because I still think the phrase "going out" belongs back in 6th grade...but whatever.  lol, well, who's to say I didn't start coming to the scene shop to chill with you and Katy and Lauren and such?  It might not have been because I'm "dating" Larry.  (lol, trying to find a word that works for us)  Unfortunately, that is part of the reason why I did end up hanging out there...but I really like it!  You guys are pretty cool!  And what the heck is with this pessimistic foreshadowing?  lol...well...maybe not foreshadowing...but you get my idea.    Nathan -Don't worry about the eating contest...I'm in a beauty pageant in my diary on TOD.  lol, so you're definitely not the most far gone of us all.  :D  hmmm...trying to think of a good signature.  Not working!

      Yay! Chicago quote! Well, I'm in a much better mood today, folks. Yesterday even Ewoks didn't make me happy. I'm trying to get my friend Marggy to stop hating Anakin Skywalker, so I'm chronicling the transition from Jake Lloyd to James Earl Jones, as it were. It's interesting. And now, a new feature: Erin's fanfiction recommendation of the week. You may never read it or even care, but I do. I recommend "The Winds of Change," a Star Wars fanfic by geo3 on fanfiction.net. It's 38 chapters long now, and very, very good. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

      But woulnd it be funny if you did?  I saw you rapping in my head. You had a gold watch and everything. Bling, whatever. Which reminds me, Michael has just recently been made aware of my use of british slang, and has coined the term Blang. I found this hilarious.  Michael is funny. shout out to Michael.  Jonah should spell his name right.  Jonah, with your jubilation and your Konversions, one would think you'd have updated your toaster stories. Am I going to have to finish that for you? Your gonna lose readers.  So Sophia is with Larry now? That would explain you showing up in the scene shop.  I thought it was random coincidence.  How come you didn't tell me? I didn't find out till you were talking to Katie in Physiology,   Oh well.  Still happy. Still worried about it. I feel like a content Arthur Dent, or Rincewind.

      Ever find yourself doing something you find really deplorable in other people?  Yep, I was in an eating contest.  At three and a half plates, I was tied for the second to lowest place, but it was still exciting.  Golden Corral's the best place for it too.  After that we went to Liz's and played Malarky, which I did slightly better at. I've graduated from Leprachaun to Ewok.  Come on Friday, you'll see what I mean.  (Especially if you saw Wizard of Oz). Oh, and new stuff at my other blog, if you want to know. SQ(u)EE!

       Knote: Bekause of the alphabetikal kontinuity of this entry, kreative spellings are konstantly kalled upon  Wow.  I expected more komplaints.  Thomas, Soph, and Marten liked it, Lara didn't komplain, and I don't even know if Erin read it.  I'm still the center of attention, so I'm happy.  However, just for fun, a list of komplaints I half expected to recieve.  I reached ten posts a long time ago and I didn't get a Jubilee! Jubilee is a 25th anniversary anyway. Those are elephants!?! (Okay so I did get that) I never said/sung/rapped that! I would never rap, period. I got shafted because my speech was 90% static! When did Lara write a book? Like you know Laurence Fishburne. Ha! Diddo for J-Lo. and, last but not least, Laurence didn't say "Sip Responsibly" once!  Luckily you didn't komplain so I don't have to answer those.  Anyway, great fun all around and now back to regularly scheduled entries.  And Now Mfto7 (Yep, it says 7)  Marten:   I assume the "most" in "most of that is pretty klose to what would happen if Laurence Fishburne interviewed us" refers to the rap.  Soph:   I think you write your poetry better than I do.  Nathan:  It's more a live elephant  koncept.   Thomas:  It wasn't really that random.  You knew it was koming.  Lara:  You have to make the celebration yourself, y'know.  It ain't easy. And the doomspork is used to eat souls.  Erin:  Welcome to the blog.  Good job on the play.  I don't think you should share title schemes, get your own ASAP:)  Laurence:  Thanks for hosting the show buddy, I owe you one. SKWEE!

      Celebrating 10 posts of Jonah! (Hosted by Laurence Fishburne!)  AD= AD= AD= AD= ADs AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= ADs AD= AD= AD= AD= ^A line of live elephants, because any good celebration has live elephants.   Laurence Fishburne:  Hi, I'm Laurence Fishburne, and welcome to Jonah's Jovial, Jocular J-post Jubilee.  I've been reading Jonah's posts since he began them a little less then a month ago, and they have had a profound influence on me.  I spend so much time reading that blog, that I only did one take of each of the scenes in Matrix Revolutions.  That's why it was so bad.  Keanu Reeves: Also, I can't act!  Laurence Fishburne:   Anyway, that's why I decided to host this special.  And Now, a montage of the best moments of Jonah's fabulous posts.  So I'm joining another blog. Don't expect to hear much from me./For whom are we writing this anyway? For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience?/ I just realized that I am really, really sexy. Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy. I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants. I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic./Thomas: Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred. It'd be funny./I was kinda kidding, but whatever./Fighting makes me sad/The moral of this post: Don't volunteer to do two stories in one weekend if you also have a page to design and the paper gets sent to press Tuesday!/But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk. In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat. Yay!/Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone!    Laurence Fishburne:  I guess Montages work better with something other than text! Next, Blog founder Marten Dollinger will say a few words.  Marten:  Nice work and stuff, I guess.  Laurence Fishburne:  And now, a musical presentation by fellow blogger Thomas, and his band The Fanny Pack Five.   Thomas:  (to the tune of a certian Weezer song.) His name is Jonah, he writes really good posts! He's not from Barcelona, but he makes a mean slice of toast! Come sit next to him, Pour yourself some Slim- Fast, like Granma made when you were on a diet Things were better then, you couldn't eat chicken, You gave up that trend when you didn't lose weight.  This song is not going as planned, The lyrics suck and should be banned, The rhyming is bad when it exists at all, The resemblence to the original is small, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and gone, Yeah they're gone! (Really cool guitar riffs.)   Laurence Fishburne:  Well, now that the audience is gone, it's time for Jonah's brother Nathan to say a few words. (That didn't come out right.)  Nathan:  Jonah's posts have been a true inspiration to me.  A few weeks ago, I was planning to develop an addiction to cough syrup or toad licking, because I couldn't take this cruel world anymore.  Then, I got on the blog and read those beautiful words, "Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall."  Suddenly, it made sense how wonderful this world is.  I've been a staunch supporter ever since!  Laurence Fishburne:  Thanks Nate! Now a poem from blogger Sophia.  Sophia  Thanks Laurence.  This is a poem I wrote for Jonah.  It's called Ode to Jonah.  Jonah is cool, Jonah is neat. If he were a food group, he would be meat. Jonah is sexy, Jonah is cute. He melts number 7 plastic fruit. Jonah writes losts of nifty posts, and according to Thomas makes good toast. Life without Jonah would be sad indeed, Like a yard all full of weeds.   Laurence Fishburne:  (crying) That was beautiful. Now a word from Jennifer Lopez.  J-Lo:  I don't know this Jonah guy, but I want to talk about what the letter J means to me.  Without J, my name would be Ennifer Lopez.  The shortening would be E-Lo, or possibly just Lo.  Either way, I'm glad Jonah's decided to celebrate this letter.  Laurence Fishburne:  Now blog writer Erin will perform a freesyle rap.  This doesn't sound good.  Erin (dressed in baggy clothes and a backwards cap):   Jonah is neat, he's a pretty swell guy, He's had 10 posts, that's more than nine. He knows Laurence Fishburne, and that's pretty rad, He draws people in like newspaper ad. This rap's pretty lousy, I won't say it's not, But hey, I made it up on the spot. So way to go Jonah, for 6 posts plus 4, Here's to the rest, to 16 more! Word.   Laurence Fishburne:  Now, a word from Micheal Christie, who introduced Jonah to blogging.  Micheal Christie:  Jonah's posts are awful.  Originally, he wrote decent posts but now they're all fluff, randomness and meaningless titles.  Although, it's nothing compared to the new Matrix.  Laurence Fishburne was especially...  Laurence Fishburne:  That's enough of that.  Our final writer, Lara, is in Seattle on a book tour, but she's with us via satellite.  Lara, on staticy screen:  Jonah bzzt crckle doom spork bzzz fizzle elephants zzt bzzizle 700 fizzz brzzle pop bzzz much. So, bzzz crckle fzzble a really good pie. Thanks Laurence.  Laurence Fishburne:  Well there you have it, bzzz crckle a really good pie.  How better to describe Jonah then that.   Until next time, I'm Laurence Fishburne, signing out.

      Well, well. It finally has worked! Erin here, I finally got in this thing, so... here I am. Thanks to those who came to see the play-- it did have some great lines, the definitive one probably being "WHAT??" That's a cast joke... Marten is letting me share his topic of subject lines-- quotes from movies and books. That one is from Monstrous Regiment, the newest Terry Pratchett. And now I have to go, for the stage calls me home in about 45 minutes.  SQ(u)EE!

      First off, congratulations to Marten and Soph, the show was excellent.  Now none of us will be able to stop quoting from it.  He He ........ 2000 aeroplanes........he he. Overall, I've had a really amazing day, basically the polar opposite of Jonah's. First period a project I wasn't looking forward to presenting got postponed.  Then in choir, I got a solo from an audition I thought I'd bombed(Laura and Heather got the others, by the way).  In Theatre Arts we broke into work groups of four, except mine only contains two, and the other one is a really hot girl who I don't really know.  In Allgebra II, I actually finished the midterm.  I have absolutely no idea how I did on it, but finishing is a one up from the last test I took in that class. Zach Dzuba played Mandolin for us today.  It was very amusing.  He was borrowing it, but he's saving up to buy his own. Lara. Get. Title. Scheme. NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SQ(u)EE!

      Its true, they are. I was at my friend's house and her parents were talking about it.   Hurray!! I get a doomspork!....what does it do?  One of my friends actually had a relationship for shorter than that.. It was only for 30 seconds but it was forced so it might not really count to you people. Her parents don't want her to date until after high school either. Which brings me to the fact that I have a boyfriend! No Marten you cannot hit him with your stick. He comes to my locker every morning and he walks me to my bus after school and thats almost the only time I get to see him, but oh well.  SQ(u)EE!

      How many day hath past since my last post?   Verily, I say it has been many, for mine post hast passed into the archives like flowers into winter's first snow.   Alas, alas for me, for what shall I say now that I at last post? What news to report?   Random bad things keep happening to me.  Yesterday a saxophone mouthpiece hit me in the head, and I've still got a scab.  Today I threw up for no apparent reason.  I also had a random headache and tripped over a microphone cord somewhere in there.  However, I'm still in surprisingly good spirits, possibly because there is no band practice today.  Also, I'm going to see la obra de teatre de Erin y Marten. (I apologize for the language switch.  When I can't think of an English word I use a spanish one.)  I was thinking about asking a girl to go with me, like on a date, but I probably won't. And now an announcement.  My next post will be my 10th post, and will have a J title.  Since 10 is a milestone and J is the best letter in all the alphabet, it shall have to be an excellent extravaganza of a post.   urlLink An amusing comic.(The beginning may not make much sense, but it's the last panel that's funny.)  Instead of my normal ending section, I'll conclude with this.    Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone!

      Well, in the time since my last post I've had my first girlfriend, my first break-up, and the worlds shortest relationship in general.  I was Sasha's first boyfriend too and apparently, her parents don't want her to date until she's out of high school.  Stupid overprotective asian parents.  So my first relationship lasts a day and odd hours.  Wonderful. And I left the stupid Etymology project at school somewher and I have no idea where. I know you don't want to hear about my love life, but I need to vent to someone.  I hope you don't mind to much. SQ(u)EE!

      Romeo and Juliet is officially screwed.  I called for line eight times in the last scene today, six of them on the same monologue.  I'm sure you guys are having hell of it to though.  ABout eight of us are coming out to see you. I have mixed feelings about the crazy hot girl whose been all over me lately.  On the one hand, she's hot and she's all over me.  On the other hand, this is such a sudden change I fear she may be using me for something.  Oh well.  I'm still enjoying the hell out of it. I can't wait to see Camp! Ok, umm, Erin looks nothing like Renee Zwelleger, but it's really funny to imagine her doing those songs.  Deanna was apparently mistaken when she told me Bob Barker was dead; in fact the man who had previously hosted The Price is Right before him passed away.  Soph, it was right before you left, and you gave me a weird look and said, "okay...."  SQ(u)EE!

      Why weren't any of you at speech? It was really fun, even if I did only get 4 1/2 hours of sleep.  I chickened out of talking to Christen and only exchanged a few pleasantries with her brother.  Technically, we were competing in different catagories but I think we got the same number of sweeps points, since LN is really slipping and LC is on the rise.  Oh, plus I got my bronze seal, which signifies my status as ubernifty speechifier.    On the halloween party:  I'm  really  tired.  It was great to see Hannah again, though.  Sorry I tried to kiss you, Soph, it's one of those sudden whims I get.  Who was that Andrew guy?  Does he go to LN or LC?  I've never seen him before in my life. I ate too much.  I'm going back to bed. SQ(u)EE!

      Now it's my turn to say Merry Christmas, Life Day, Hogswatch, or whatever you celebrate. My dad's family is over at my house right now. That's eleven cousins, ladies and gentlemen, plus aunts and uncles. Fun! I almost got to see LOTR yesterday, but at the last minute, I didn't. So I'm probably seeing it next week. Marten-- other things that smell bad, if you're still thinking of doing that parody: we had wookiees and Governor Tarkin, but there's also A Tauntaun and The Inside of a Tauntaun.

      Merry Christmas or secular holiday of your choice, everyone! Sorry I haven't posted lately, but you wouldn't believe how busy I've been.  Actually you probably would, but I don't feel like telling you all of it.   Last night we watched  The Pajama Game .  Ugh... I'm not sure I even  want  to try out now.  And, just like in  Oklahoma! , the two best songs were left out of the movie, while plenty of awful and/or pointless ones were left in.  Why can't our school do a good musical for once? It doesn't feel like Christmas eve, namely because I've been to busy with totally non-Christmas-related things to be anticipating it all that much.  I haven't finished you guys's Christmas presents yet, either, so don't expect to get them any time near Christmas.  Sorry. In other news,  Return of The King  ruled!  Can't wait for the four and a half hour extended edition.  Or five.  I hope it's five. In other, other news, Charles Dickens'  A Christmas Carol  rules!  Like a bad lobster!  Well, rotate my vertices and call me a trapezoid!

      Ha! A christmas title with only Ws! I've still got it! (X is Next, I may have to cheat) Anyways, Merry Christmas Eve and happy Winter Holiday to you non Christians.  (If we have any; I don't think we do)  I had a very weird dream last night.  I became a techie for a scuba-cheerleading squad who traveled around the country in a van.  They ended up switching to regular cheerleading and then acting because times evidentally got tough.  Then, we were stopped in my hometown and I was taking a walk when I saw my dad at a magazine stand that said Comstock & Comstock & Comstock: Booksellers, Arcade Games, & Fun.  I was all like "You started a business without me?" and we was like "Well, you had to run off and join the cheerleading squad."  So I said, "Well, why Comstock & Comstock & Comstock instead of Comstock & Sons?" and he replied, "Well, If you'd been here you might have had a say in the naming process.  That's about all I remember. Lord of the Rings was awesome.  Particularly the Oliphants.  Btw, Trebuchets are in this season, so buy one for your loved ones today.  What better way to say I love you than a giant slingshot that shoots fire? Oh, also I have a girlfriend now, which marks the first time Nathan and I have both had girlfriends simultaneously.  I don't think any of you know her, because she's a Craig person.  For my new section, I have self referencing paper of the day, which is urlLink  "This Is the Title of This Story, Which Is Also Found Several Times in the Story Itself"  also, I encourage you to read "Self Reference, which is linked to at the bottom of "This is the Title"  I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

      Mleh to you, Michael.  I'll say what I say and do what I do.  Word.  lol just kidding.  Sorry, just posted a ghetto Christmas poem on my diary and the ghetto-ness is contageous.  Just wanted to wish everyone happy (insert holiday here)!  I hope everyone has  a good holiday and a good break.    You guys' phobias are silly.  I'm slightly arachnaphobic and claustrophobic...but not to the point of whatever.  I suppose I am a little afraid of going into the guys' bathroom, but I think that's just funny cuz it's not like they'd mind if there was a girl in their bathroom, right?  Oh, and, Marten, I hate that feeling...that your fly is unzipped...I always triple check before leaving the bathroom, just to make sure that I'm not showing everyone my pink polka-dotted underwear.  Not that they'd mind.  Again.  oh well.  bye.    Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret.

      None of my phobias have names.  When you see the giant list of Phobias, it's hard to imagine they left any out , but mine are very obscure. The first one is the irrational fear that I've just walked into the wrong bathroom, characterized by repeatedly poking my head out the door to check the sign and occasionally leaving the stall door slightly open so I can see urinals.  (I realize some of you may not have wanted to know that, but when I'm ranting it's hard to stop) My second and much worse fear is talking to answering machines.  They're horribly misnamed, because they don't answer.  They talk, beep, and then just listen silently.  The worst part is, unlike people, they remember everything they hear perfectly.  Once you've said it, there's no taking it back. So, normally, if I call someone and the answering machine picks up, I hang up immediately in fear.  Sometimes, though, you just have to reach someone.  In these cases I'll leave a message.  I'll start talking, but the silence on the other end makes me uncomfortable, and I start rambling to fill the silence, until I've forgotten what I was gonna say, at which point I start mumbling and hang up.  After I've hung up, I realize how awful it sounds and call back in order to apologize for the first message and say what I need to say, but this doesn't always work as planned either.  So, anyone I call and leave a message for thinks I'm a gibbering idiot, and it's all the fault of those dram answering machines. Anyway, if any of you know or would like to make up names for those, please let me know.  In other news, Tales is updated.  Reply to Michael's e-mail already.  I want to change my links to  urlLink 5-minute Voyager  and  urlLink Triangle and Robert  (I'd forgotten how raunchy PWOT was). And please, please help me think of a new title scheme.  Time is running out!  Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret. (This is from T&R btw)

      i was thinking about people of different religions, and people of no religion, and how that relates to me.  I have quite a few friends of different religions, and i thought about free will. We obviously have the right not to believe in God, or Jesus.  Otherwise we wouldn't have free will.  Also, how could people of different religions believe so adamantly in there own as I do in mine if there weren't some truth in it?  In general moral belief, all religions are pretty much the same.  I mean, generally one doesn't hear of actual satan worshiping religions, becasue they'd be out killing everyone including themselves. Of course, if you worshipped satan, you proobably would belive in God and Jesus, you'd just be on the opposite side.  What we do hear about are Extreme Puritans, or terrorists. They aren't always Muslims, they just are currently.  I'm not quite sure where i was going with all this, but its a random thought that hit me.  Discuss.

This is my last chance to pimp out my site before departure tomorrow so I'm taking it. GO  urlLink HERE  NOW!  And also add "prolly" , "nurr", "Cya"  and "WoRdS wItH rAnDoM CaPiTaLiZaTiOn" to the Echelon list of words that annoy Michael. Although my pointing that out will probably just make you say them more.  And Marten, the word "subjugate" will forever be dirty in my mind.  And Thomas, Sorry if I appeared dodgy, I thought you wanted one of my Twizzlers. And You would have had to have pried them out of my cold dead hands! And Sophia, I believe the quote is a misinterpretation of one of Maya Angelou's poem. The one where she's got oil wells digging in her back yard. Yeah, that one. (if you were in my 9H English class during the interpretive reading of that poem you saw Taylor Sheridan groping himself. Yeah, I wish I had missed it too.)  Does my sexiness offend you?

      Shoutout to Jonah for being the only person who actually listens to really really simple instructions.  Another Shoutout to Jonah, who is (as if we didn't already know) a really good feature writer.  urlLink These  people said so.   It's the 13th of December! Which means that I will begin daily updates of What Kind of Day Has It Been. Yay! Updates. I probably won't post much at Compendium. Actually it's all touch and go because the laptop, which incidentially is older than I am, may not be able to connect to the internet, thus making it worthless to drag out to California as my Carry On Luggage!  He'll try to tuck and roll, but it won't work because he has square pants.

       Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha...I write this from a seat of power, for I have admin access and you have none. Ha Ha Ha   Marten: Not For Long, Michael Michael:  Ha! You cannot defeat me! I defeat you!  urlLink You're Fired ! Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!  Marten: I have been vanquished! No!!!  But seriously people, I want you to look at the Changes at Compendium  Each Blogger Gets Two Personal Links. I have mine down. I guessed on a couple of yours, but e-mail me if you have none or want some or think that I suck.  Comments are fixed so now Ryan can say that I suck. I guess he saw me do my monologue.  I am officially Glark to Marten's Sars. Click on my link to figure that out. Or E-mail me  urlLink here.

      Shout-out to the nice lunch lady at LN.  The one in the Taco line, with the accent.  She always brightens my day.  Debate! It's a wonderful thing.  We had one today first period and I crushed the opposition (namely Nathan).  I'm curious, Marten.  Who else reads the blog but doesn't write? (besides Ryan).   In terms of the Thomas situation, anytime you see that he's online, IM him with  Post on the Blog!  every five seconds.  If we all do this, he'll have no choice but to comply.  Do not, however, use the same strategy with me and Corndog. In other news, I'm ditching MMtto??? as a section, and I'm going to add something new.  Right now I'm going with random capitalized comment of the entry.  This one is: ARGLE BLARGLE IS NOT MY CHICKEN'S NAME, SO STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY SPLEEN! With any luck, they'll get progressively more random. Michael, explain this shoutout to me please. Sophia, good luck with that I guess, and I hope you feel better, too. Marten, nice endy thingy Finally, Why in the Hellenistic era doesn't the blog link to  Tales , yet!?!?  Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe!

      That's kind of what JournalCon is. You celebrate survival and give me tips on how to deal with the heathen monkey. And no, you can't blame everything on Mr. Hall. That's what Mrs. Mohr is for.  Ok, What's next.  Tommy needs to post. Seriously. SERIOUSLY.  Note to everyone. I don't know, I forgot. I probably won't post for a while out of respect for the others in this blog. I'm on hiatus. The lid is on, have a great holiday. Read my daily updates at What Kind of Day Has It Been.   What's Next?

      I blame Mr. Hall for everything.  He made me lose debate.  We should have a party at the end of the six weeks when we no longer have to deal with him.  I'm a Thespian!

      Eww! No one wants to here about your menstration! And Aw. Also I think the word is Ya'll  Also, I hate the Librarian at LC. The one with glasses that's perpetually dressed in barf-green. She's a bitch on wheels. You can read more about her Memorial Day, 2006 in "Graduation Day, Part Two" coming to Michael's blog soon. Or more specifically less than three years.  PS - I am shutting down What Kind of Day Has It Been...Wait for it...Wait for it...Wait for it...25 August 2006. It's a high school blog, and I have signed a three year, $400,000 per entry contract with Blogspot and Blogger. Don't fret, I am allowed unlimited posts at Compendium, until Marten gets bored, and the Comstocks have to start their college applications (and with all their extra-curriculars, to be considered for the 2006-2007 year, they're going to have to start...right now)  Also does anyone wonder why Thomas is perpetually online, yet never posts? I seem him all the time on my buddy list.

       Marten: Maybe I have been different.  I can't tell anymore.  I think that the fact that I'm super pmsing *I know ya'll didn't want to know that, but figured it might explain something*, and suspect that I have the flu might just have put enough stress on me to act like a major bitch.  I don't know.  I'm sorry for doing whatever I did and for having a hard time.  Please forgive me.    Michael: Thanks for standing up for me...I think...lol I didn't really understand what you were doing with that post, but I recognized that you were telling Marten off just as much as you were telling me off.  So thank you.  Nathan: yeah, as you can tell, girls are weird.  We're all weird.  It's just part of our physiology...I'm surprised there isn't a specific gene that makes a specific protein (Woo hoo Mr. Lamishaw's class!) that makes us stranger than you.  Who knows.  But, yeah, it's the whole "I want what I can't have" mindset that's making these chicks *did I just say chicks?!* swoon over you.  and I'm happy that you're happy with Ashley!  :D

      Shoutout to JJ Abrams who just gave one of our own bloggers a magnificant shout-out last night on Alias. Congratulations on being the new Will, Jonah.  11 days until cut off people. I may check my e-mail on the twentieth but I may not so get JournalCon RSVPs  IN MY MAILBOX  by December 19th. E-mail is here. E-mail me even if you aren't coming so I'll know that you aren't coming, rather than just thinking that you are ignoring me, which I'm pretty sure most of you are.  TWoP Quote  "Oh, ABC! You and your viewer-discretion advisory. Trying so hard to be all rough and tumble. It's cute. Anyway. We open on a very rainy day, and two FBI agents chasing some other dude through an alley. It's very blue in Richmond, apparently. I'll add that to the list of things cinematography has taught me about geography: thanks to Line Of Fire, I know that Richmond is blue. Thanks to Traffic, I know that Mexico is yellow." Jessica on  Line of Fire

       Michael: This is not just a personal vendetta against one action by Sophia, this is a late reaction to a month of on and off bitchy behavior  Sophia:  I'm sorry if I've offended you, but you really have been different, and I'm not the only person around you that's noticed, but whether this is just a stupid Marten Paranoia thing or not, I'd like to keep it offline.  I'd also appreciate it if you didn't blatantly insult my friends online.  Nate:  um... yeah.... girls are weird.

      I've figured out how my luck with girls works!  It's not that they don't pay any attention to me at all.  It's just that they do it in clumps!  Whenever I commit myself to a relationship, it seems 2 or 3 incredibly attractive girls who never payed me any attention before start hanging all over me and pouring out there hearts to me, because now I have to tell them to stop.  There was Sarah and Sasha, and now that I'm so happy with Ashley, of course a really hot girl starts talking to me about how lonely she is and how I'm the only nice person there.  Mind you, given an actual choice between those two, I would have chosen Ashley anyway, but I still wish that sort of thing would happen to me when I'm single. Sorry if I bore you, that's my life.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      I am an instigator. I am a scrappy terrier that will chew your leg off if you look at me funny. That's why what I'm going to say is going to be more shocking than the last five minutes of a majorly-hyped Law and Order episode.  Sophia and Marten are being childish and need to bury the metaphorical hatchet.  You know Marten, you're the administrator of this blog and I respect that. However I think your indignation towards Sophia is covered in crap. Petualantly hiding away and editing posts isn't going to make this go away. Okay, Sophia may have offended a loyal reader. Big Deal. That's not nearly as bad as the time when I told Erin that my post may be so asinine she should "close [her] eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better" If you would have let this g, talked to her face to face, and I'm not just talking about the Ryan Hagan post, but rather the calling here bitchy, than this would have been a non story. But instead you openly attack her on the blog, which automatically put her on the defensive. Now Sophia's mad and you're mad and the rest of us are caught in the crossfire. But if you insist on starting things, than you better finish them completely, because if you just hide away than I will wait in the tall grass for you, Marten, because you are killing the blog.  I'm not saying that Marten was the only one wrong in this argument. I have once (spectacularly) gone off on someone and made mountains out of molehills. But Blatantly attacking a read with no reason given to this sudden outburst is just confusing and apparently unacceptable. If you are going to hate something you need to give a reason, because otherwise you look petty and small. And Believe me, I know petty and small. But you have to remember that I openly apologized and extended an olive branch once I realized that I was wrong and that my comments were offensive and petty. So If you don't stop being "bitchy" and apologize to both Ryan and Marten, than you are just as wrong as Marten is, and someday we may look back and realize that Compendium, what was a Utopian Shangri-La for hilarous intellectuals, failed because petty squabbling between the writers.  I may be hypocritical for saying this. I might me monumentally out of line. I am pretty sure I looked back five minutes ago and saw that line that you don't cross with an administrator fading away in the rear-view mirror. Marten, If you don't want to apologize, If you believe that you are absolutely right, than I accept that. But if you believe that you were wrong and are just afraid to swallow your pride and apologize, then God, Marten. I don't even want to know you

      Shoutouts to Rachel Griffiths (who had a baby), Tom Cruise (who got a haircut), The cast of The OC (who are #1 on the TV list of breakout stars of 2003) and Keira Knightsley (who is number one in movies)  C.J.: Good morning, Mrs. Landingham. Where are we in the saga of Toby and the President? MRS. LANDINGHAM: They seem to be having a disagreement. C.J.: A disagreement or a fight? MRS. LANDINGHAM: Well, it certainly has the potential... BARTLET [OS] [shouts]: Oh, for God’s sakes Toby! MRS. LANDINGHAM: There we go.  Oooh, Chickfight on the blog. Ten bucks on Sophia. Any takers?  The Following is the expressed opinion of Michael Christie, and does not reflect the views of Marten Dollenger or the Staff of Compendium of Stupidity  I think that it would make sense if Sophia gave a reason why she hated Ryan Hagan. That would explain why. Also I find it somewhat shocking that Marten actually edited a post.  I'd also just like to congratulate Compendium of Stupidity on three months online.   Also I'll be posting a piece on weddings, currently titled "Untitled Michael Christie Blog Post". It's so delightfully meta, don't you think?  The Obligatory Television Without Pity quote. These will appear until y'all visit.  Pamie: That damn SuChin is finishing up.  Stee: Now, SuChin...she won a contest, right? She's not actually a VJ. Please tell me that.  Pamie: She does that thing to me that happens to Kramer when he hears Mary Hart's voice.  Stee: I'm gonna interview you in the style of the MTV Video Music Awards opening.  Pamie: Okay. And I'll do it like a guy who's there.  Stee: "Okay, okay! So Pam! I mean, I mean...! Hey, there's...! I'm standing...! Hey! I...there's....! Thanks, Kurt! I'm standing here on the red carpet with...Pam--"  Pamie: "Right, right, true, true!"  Stee: "So, Pam! This is absolutely amazing here tonight, isn't it?"  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying, I've been, I mean, you know. I'm just here. I'm just sayin'. You know, everything's been a really good year and we're all just really happy about everything--"  Stee: "--Is--?"  Pamie: "--and how everything has worked out."  Stee: "Now, isn't our red carpet really red?"  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying, it's like, yeah, I mean, it's like, crazy, man, it's like, amazing."  Stee: "Now, I understand that you, uh, don't like Kurt Loder. Is that true?"  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying. Everybody has like, things going on and stuff and it's like, you kinda, you know, you work through it. You know, and everything. But my new album, CHICKEN AND RED MEAT, drops October7th, and that is what it's all about. CHICKEN! CHICKEN! OCTOBER SEVENTH!"  Stee: "All right..."  Pamie: "WOOOOOO!"  Stee: "How many, how many hours a day do you watch MTV?"  Pamie: "What? I'm sorry, I was talkin' to my boy! That's my boy right there! T-Bok! And T-Bok, come over here, T-Bok! Woooo!"  Stee: "I forget..."  Pamie: "WOOOOO!"  Stee: "I forget who I'm...who you're talking to."  Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying."  Stee: "Hey, fat guy! Uh...Sway! Umm...."  Pamie: "Wooo! October 7th!"  Stee: "SuChin! Someone help me!"  Pamie: "October 7th! October 7th!"  Stee: Man.  Pamie: And now...the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards! In the hizzy! -Pamie and Stee on The MTV Video Music Awards. The Hilarious Title of the Recap is "Yo Yo! Our Recap Drops On September 8th! Hollah!"  Seriously there is something for all of y'all. Children of Dune recaps for the Comstocks. Regina's Alias Recaps for Marten. I don't know what Thomas, Sophia, Erin or Lara watch, so I guess there are only things for the Comstocks and Marten. Never mind.

I decided to "edit" that one myself so you didn't have to take the time out of your schedule to do it for me.  You're welcome.  Michael-That quote was pretty funny.

      This is a parody I just finished from our hypothetical musical  A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Ithaca .  To the tune of the Stones' "Wild Horses".  Enjoy!  Gods in heaven, it’s easy to do The things you wanted, we sacrificed them to you Immortal Lady, you know who I am, You know you can’t let me lose to Priam  All our forces, couldn’t get into Troy All our forces, couldn’t get into Troy  You’ve watched us suffer, fighting in vain, Helen is still there, inside their domain No sweeping exits from enemy lines Could make us feel bitter and leave her behind  Men and horses, could get lost in the fray All our forces, still would not go away  I know I’ve dreamed of getting inside And Meneleaus, would get back his bride Walls would be broken, Tears would be cried All of the Trojans, soon will have died  Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy  Large, Wheeled horse, could get us into Troy Trojan forces, we soon would destroy  To be perfectly honest, Jonah came up with the idea and part of one of the verses.  It's still sort of a work in progress, so any suggestions would be appreciated.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.

      Marten - No Hipster Flare sounds like a pair of pants. Also the socratic thing got blown to hell once you hired me. Because while it maybe interesting. It just ain't funny. Nathan - I'm now the president of yo' mama! Bow before me, The President of the Kingdom of Ma Hornbeck! Erin - Queen of the Trees? Do tell. Also did you see your love thread on the forums. There's a link somewhere around here. Also everyone loves Ewan McGregor!...That sounded straighter in my head. I'm sorta having a gay day today. Sophia - As Do I. Though It would be sad if he saw this and slit our throats while we were sleeping. But not together. Although I wouldn't mind sleeping together. Because I'm straight.   I was at Bethlehem Village tonight and wasn't able to mod the thing. It's okay, y'all didn't seem interested anyway. I'm [illegally] downloading the second season premiere of The West Wing, In The Shadow of Two Gunmen, Parts One and Two. They won the Emmy for best writing in an episode. They also reveal "Who's been hit! Who's been hit!" (I sincerely hope it's not CJ. Allison Janney rocks. And According to EW Allison Janney was the best thing to happen in that stupid Mandy Moore movie "How To Deal".)  I don't know what else to say, so I'm just going to quoteTelevision Without Pity You don't care, but I do [tm Erin]  "Paris and Nicole are giving interviews on a red carpet for the premiere of their show. The interviewer asks if they are ready for this. I think a better question is, "Are we, the viewers, and in fact all of America, ready for this?" And the answer is, "It's December and sweeps are over, so why the hell not?"" -Kim on  The Simple Life

      I kinda meant for this blog to be somewhat socratic, but it never happened. Started to with the Time thread, but it died.   Jonahs new title scheme should be things that sound like attacks from animes! You know, in those action sequence thingies when They say the name of the attack?Like Hipster Flare.

      In case some people haven't heard me say this yet, go see Love Actually! Great movie. Not just one happy ending-- but lots!  This weekend I am finishing college and Prelude applications, studying for precal test, working on research paper, memorizing my lines as queen of the trees, and making elf hats. Hopefully somewhere in there I will fall unconscious and not wake up until December 20.  I am six lines away from being finished with my latest parody, "At the End of the Day- Naboo Style!"  I have a horrible suspicion that, were there to be an online Socrates Cafe, I wouldn't have enough time to attend.  Jonah's blank entry leads me to suspect that he may be the Phantom Menace. I have a bad feeling about this...  Segue to Erin's Fanfiction Recommendation of the Week ("You might not care, but I do."): The Shifty Troublemaker, a TPM parody on fanfiction.net. This piece is very clever: frequent references are made to George's quest for more money through spectacular marketing and his love affair with impressive CGI creations such as Jar Jar and the Wizard Eopies, not to mention the Lego (tm) Podracers. Anakin has tourette's. Coruscant is one giant disco bash. Qui-Gon loves his drugs and perhaps a certain young Scot. This fanfic is the origin of the infamous penguin line. Need I say more?

      I love drama!  More on that later. I would be scared if Michael were president of anything.  More on that would be superfluous. I think an online socrates cafe would not work at all.  everyone would be talking at once and so the discussion would be somewhat stunted.  That happens on all chat rooms and I doubt this one would be any different.  So for now I'm gonna say no.  Even  if  Christen's there, seeing as I have a girlfriendwith whom I'm quite happy. Ok, Drama.  Today in our scene groups we all got the same scene, but we had to figure out what the somewhat cryptic dialogue was about, and make up motions to go along with it.  It was really fun. I have four essays to write.  That makes me sad ): But Drama, Ashley and the fact that it smells like Christmas make me happy (: Jonah: How about AB, then AC, then AD, etc.  either in the first word or the first and second?

      I hate Drama. More on that later.  I want to Run for School President. More on that later.  I would be glad to moderate an online "Socrates Cafe: Now with 75% less Guthrie!" Just grab a frappuchino and IM me at SBristowSD6 so I can let you in. I probably won't talk much, cause I'd be doing other stuff, but I can create private chat room (I don't know if all of you with AIM can do that. If you can then someone else will do it.)

      The end is near! Z is fast approaching, and the end of my title scheme with it.  My options are: Switch to numbers (Very Difficult) Use double letters (Difficult unless I'm posting about different sizes of batteries or BB guns) Start over at A (Boring) Make up a totally new scheme (Conceptually painful- I stand to lose my alphabetical identity)  So, as you can see, they all have disadvantages, so your suggestions would be appreciated.   Second, the blank page. When I saw it, I thought it was either the stupidest or  most brilliant thing I'd ever seen.  But I didn't want to dis it without trying it, so I made a blank post.  And it was refreshing.  If nothing else, it stimulated conversation. Sophia - That sounds like a great idea, but for me a big part of Socrates Cafe was being on a coffee high, so I don't know how much I'd enjoy the discussion without it.  Out of curiosity, how is Guthrie limiting the numbers? Fourth order of business, my life is crazy.  Just for fun, I'm going to list all of the things that contribute to that.  Band Things  Marching band Fiesta Bowl Prep Pep Band rehearsals and games ISSMA Solo and Ensemble contest Concert band concert in a week  Church Things  Choir cantata and rehearsals Pagaent and rehearsal(s) Youth Group (Tiny Tim) Brass Quintet Brass duet with Thomas  School Things  Book Report/ Reading of book for World History Debate in Lyceum Next issue of North Star Regular Homework  Other Things  Speech Supporting the craziness of others (attending choir, orchestra concerts) Eating Sleeping Trying to have a social life  Wow, 18.  That's more than I would have thought.  Anyway, that's pretty crazy, so if I don't post again before January, that's why.

      lol, I thought Jonah's intentionally-left-blank post was quite refreshing.  :D    Now, I was struck with a brilliant idea and was wondering if you all would be interested in joining/helping me.  Since Guthrie started limiting the number of people allowed to attend Socrates' Cafe, not everyone can go.  Which super-sucks.  So I was thinking that maybe if we started an INTERNET Socrates' Cafe, more people could join and we could have a more interesting, philosophical time on the internet!  So I propose a Socrates' Cafe CHATROOM!  Who's with me?!  Oh, and, Michael, that date is my mommy's birthday!  Just fyi!

      Guess what? You want to hear about my day? I actually stayed awake in Algebra. I made spaghetti in Nutrition and Wellness. We talked about Russia and Napoleon's Penis in Japanese, and I impaled myself on my monologue in Drama. See, this is why I don't try new things, It turns out they're either boring or I'm really bad at them. Carmela! Get me a Vodka Tonic and some lighter fluid. Daddy wants to fly! Yes I'm talking to you, you wayward Cabana Girl. Now Go!   Also I just found out that unemployed sitcom writers wear tweed. Who knew?

      Shoutout to Tim Dinger, who I think is a butthead, but he'll never find out because he's anti-blog. I have great Tim Dinger stories. Not to mention a really really funny one about Daniel Day. Remind me to tell you that one soon.  Now Nathan, I'm sure that Ioians and Ganymedians are also ungrateful and mean. Astronomy humor. Doesn't go over well with people.  The Europeans have always been mean. I've known that from the beginning of sixth-grade social studies. Europe has frequently been the enemy, just look at almost everyone of our wars has had a European enemy or been instigated by Europeans. Look at the Revolutionary War. Look at World War One. Look at Nazi Germany. Look at Russian History. (By the way, Nathan, I would highly recommend majoring in Russian History. Fascinating stuff. Even as late as 1917, Russian history has been turbulent and nebulous) Vietnam was started, indirectly by the French, British and Americans snubbing Ho Chi Minh at one of the summits after World War II. The British used Opium to get the Chinese high and take advantage of them. The Dutch did the same thing to Indians in order to acquire Manhattan Island in New York. Of course the Europeans are mean nasty and horrible. Even now most of them still are. While I have mixed views on the war in Iraq, I think that after saving French Ass in World War I and getting Germany back on it's feet after the calamitous forty-year period of War and death had to count for something. The British backing us proves that they are truely the best ally we have at this point.   I wonder how long a tangent I can go on before you all stop reading.   I think the Spanish Conquistador's behavior speaks for itself. They wiped out two advanced civilizations for gold. I think that was just greed for the point of greed. And look at Columbus. And I don't even want to bring up the fact that we gave them all Syphillis. The Swiss are probably the nicest people in the world at this point. Except for Heidi. She's a bitch.  That's my entire view of imperialization. And Nathan (last line "Especially Islam. If I were them, I'd be mad too.") I think you meant to say the Arabs who have gotten screwed over a great many times by the west. Although we had no business arming them in Afghanistan back in the eighties, then running away with our tail between our legs after Yeltsen took office. We should have worked with the Afghans, set up a government and then backed away. That (indirectly) led to Terrorist Attacks over the last ten years, including the Apartment Buildings in Riyadah, The American Embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam and the one that hit closest to home, the terrorist attacks on September 11th. Offtopic (even more than I am right now),   JONAH: Cornblog is a very stupid idea. Try something like "The Blogs of War". That will make sense after you read Julius Caesar. SOPHIA: Queen Mary? Cool. ERIN: I think I saw you this morning, but I may not have. How do you know in a school of 1,700? THOMAS: How's Columbo? LARA:ummm...Bye! I think this is it for me for a while. I'm tired and have quite a bit of work to do. I'll just leave you with this thought: "Fish Are Friends, Not Food."

      Ok, here we go.  From Jonah's list, a question about an  interesting topic. Why is history so Eurocentric? I'm really enjoying world history, despite Mrs. Layman and Spodek.  You know why?  Because, while I'm not getting a balanced perspective, I'm finally getting enough of one to see Europians for what they really are: fakes, thiefs, rip-offs.  Ungrateful, and often down right mean.  I had no idea how much revisionist history I'd been absorbing.  Europeans have only been the big players for  maybe  six hundred years.  The Chinese empire lasted like four times that long.  Dar Al Islam lasted almost twice that long.  But what do we learn about as kids?  The last 200 years.  The ones that involve America.  Maybe a little about Europe. I've been thinking a lot about my career plans, and I think I want to major in Medievil history and minor in theatre.  I'll probably still end up a teacher, but if I must teach, I'd rather teach history, and try and help kids get a somewhat better rounded view of the world.  Especially Islam.  If I were them, I'd be mad to.

      There was a mass suicide and I wasn't invited? Gasp! Anyway, I'm in Journalism SRT, and I'm supposed to be silent reading.  Anyway, I think people aren't posting because they don't know what to say.  So, I'm taking it upon myself to reaffirm what the blog is for.  -- Posting interesting developements in your life that are not gossipy or girl/boy crazy. -- Posting Philosophical quandaries about random or interesting topics, like time or love. -- Relating interesting facts about stuff like cod or England -- Posting amusing anecdotes (funny is good) -- Convorsations!!! -- Suggestions for improving the blog, or for other bloggers, like this one.  You all have atleast one of these in your head now, so post.  Or face the consequences.   It's okay! I had Subway!

      Live From Indianapolis, It's Friday Night!  I just want to say a few things. The first of which I'd like to say this. I'd certainly enjoy reading  The Complete Works of Erin Chandler . And that  Ewok  didn't look bad either. On this being an "LC Blog":Suck it up and deal, Nathan. You spent a good part of the car ride to Taj of India discussing people at LN I've never met. You want an LN Blog? Create your own. You can do that. You can create a blog just to discuss things at LN, but I will rise up an army and I will beat you. (I was paraphrasing Leo's speech on why A Proportional Response makes more sense than the disproportional response Bartlet suggested. Yes I'm just rambling here. Also I just realized that we have like eight of us here already (but only six who regularly post) But seriously that's a lot of bloggers, yo. I'm just making my point, and also using the phrase "Suck it" which I've always wanted to do. Also Nay on Flame War!  Also Jonah is totally hot!  Also speaking as a Republican, we really really need Dean or Sharpton in the White House. Not for their policies, but rather for the entertainment value. Also there needs to be a more charasmatic Republican candidate in 2008. I mean I'm talking Bartlet here.  Alright, Nay on syndication!  Also I'm introducing what, until I get bored of it, will be my new feature  GOOGLING MEMBERS OF THE BLOG!  I searched "Jonah Comstock" and there were four hits: The newspaper thing, the Indianapolis Children's Choir (Nathan was also there), Some random old thing and Corndog.  Now apparently from the Nathan hits, Our Nathan is the first "Nathan Comstock" to be born in...about one-hundred years. Seriously people.    The Nathan Comstock Timeline  1725: Nathan Comstock Born 1735: Nathan Comstock Born 1746: Nathan Comstock Born 1760: Nathan Comstock's daughter was born.  1776: Nathan Comstock Born 1786: Nathan Comstock Born 1802: Nathan Comstock Born 1806: Nathan Comstock Born 1809: Nathan Comstock was a Commissioner of the Poor in Palmyra, New York.  1816: Nathan Comstock built a cabin in Rockport, New York 1827: Nathan Comstock signed a petition having something to do with a highway in Michigan.  1862: Nathan Comstock Born  Nathan Comstock is: a Freshman Senator at Emory University, a High School Tennis Captain in Georgia, and a marathon runner in Michigan.  Thank you and Good Night!    2 links of 252 actually were Nathan Comstock. Funny, Huh?

      Actually its evening, but oh well.  I still have a bunch of random stuff to say. You know what's creepy?  Hearing your friends argue about whether or not your brother is hot.  Especially when one is a guy.  That's just my major weird experience of the day. If the constitutional amendment banning gay marraiges manages to pass, I'm going to stage a coup and overthrow the government. We need more LN people on this blog.  I move to invite Tyler Rudd or Paul Simmons.  Somehow this has turned into an LC blog with a couple of LN guys and that's not what it was supposed to be at all.  It makes me feel left out sometimes.  I also think you guys are being a little hypocritical in discussing LC teachers who Jonah and I have never met. No on Syndication. One: why do we want readers?  Two: Who would want to read any of this?  I think syndication is vain and pointless. I'm really sick of my title scheme, so as soon as I think of a good one I'm going to change it.  Just a bit of warning. Ok, none of that had anything to do with the rest of it, but thats ok.  Please don't get offended and try to start a flame war.  Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

      I hate Mr. Phillipy  I hope both he and Mr. Hall get married to eachother and die on their honemoon.  Or it would have to be a civil union thanks to stupid President over there in Washington...I don't even know if THOSE are legal here.  Stupid conservatives.    Anyways.  Mr. Phillipys such an asshole.  I agree with everything you said about him because that's EXACTLY what I was thinking...he thinks he can read Cyrano's part when there are so many people in our class who could do SO MUCH BETTER!  He's an awful speaker and he's so random.  I hate him, I hate him, I HATE HIM!  I've just had awful luck this year with gay English teachers, have I not?    I CAN'T BELIEVE HE MADE FUN OF ME FOR SAYING "OUR" FUNNY!!!    He can't even TALK about accents, stupid Pe-ru man.  Grrrrrrr.  And the whole "Bless you" thing?  Grrrrrrrrrr.  You enjoyed my pissed off acting?  I would've thought it was quite funny as well if it hadn't been me he was making fun of.  Asshole.  Nobody makes fun of me and is still my friend.  Unless if they're joking...I'm good with jokes.  But he's not joking.  He's dead serious about making fun of the way I say "our".  Eat me, Mr. Phillipy.  (Now I understand why it definitely isn't a good idea to syndicate this...sorry about the profanity guys...and about the awful comments...just sorry for making you read all of that!)

      Ha! Sophia,  you made my day.  Phillipe isn't much better, is he? What a yutz.  The guy is a horrible speaker.  We're reading Cyrano, and our teacher thinks he can read the lead.  The guy has no prose skillz. can't act.  Plus, or minus, as the case may be, hes a bloody hypocrite, he's rude, and has to have the stage constantly.  He'll cut people off on questions and go on scripted tangents.  I think he decides exactly what he's going to say before hand and if you don't follow his script hes just going to block you out.

      Do you all know how much I love snowblowers. Seriously, It took me fifteen minutes to clear off the driveway. Which is awesome. And I did it while listening to a .wav I ripped from the  urlLink cheerleading episode  of Joan of Arcadia.  Also Yay for Snow Days!  Also we can syndicate our blog. I know how to do it. It would expand our audience, which would be a good thing. Then again with some of the things said about a certain speech teacher, it may not. I'm syndicating What Kind of Day Has It Been. Just so you know.  Syndication: Yay or Nay?

      This is the last post to utilize the stupid and tedious alphabetical title scheme.  My next post wil began a totally new scheme.  But I've finally figured out what my regular section will be: Match up of the week.  This week:  Who would win in a jousting match between Helen Keller and Larry the Cucumber if Larry was riding a giant corn chip with legs and Hellen Keller was riding a potato chip of equal size with wheels? (They are both using chocolate lances, but Helen Keller's is dark chocolate and Larry's is milk chocolate)  Most of the matches will pretty much be like that.  Also, "of the week" does not mean there will be one each week.  There will still be one per entry, regardless of how they spread across weeks.  Erin, please read the comments on the posts for information about your books.  Do you think I could borrow Monstrous Regiment if I promise to read it quickly?  (Easy enough.  TH White is good, but his books take signifigantly longer to read than Terry Pratchett, whose books I have more than once read in a single night)  Also, I am surprised that Celebration is coming here again.  Pleasantly surprised though.  And this time, we'll get organized enough to enter the costume contest for real. I'd like to conclude with the word Eggplant.  But I won't, because this sentence is here.   Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

      There's more to that quote, but it sounds funny right there as it is.  Everyone should read Jonah's story if they havent been reading it already, it's awsome.  Erin, I'm surprised. I was expecting, now that I am queen I want title scheme of my own, or something closer to that quote. precious is too predictable for the times.  I'm betting Nate's the feminist and Heather's the communist. Oh, and Nate's hairstyle is now officially known as a lutefisk.  It's a Norwegian dish of cod soaked in lye.

      Erin, Word on the Golden Globes. Apparently we'll get to also see Jack "Sunglasses at Night" Nicholson knock the microphone stand back and forth. My parents asked me what the difference between the Golden Globes and the Oscars were, the main differences being these: The Golden Globes are held in a Hotel Ballroom, usually the Beverly Hilton and the Oscars are held in a theatre, usuallyThe Shrine Auditorium near USC, The Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, or the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles Music Center, Downtown (I suppose the new Gehry designed Walt Disney Music Hall is a possibility, unless the Philharmonic Orchestra are performing)  This tangent has been brought to you by NBC, the only place to see the 2004 hooker-infested Olympic Games in Athens and Drunken Celebrities at the Golden Globes.   Also the fact that the nominees and attendees sit at tables, rather than in a big theatre. Also they drink heavily.   There was really no point in me writing this entry except to say that I know a lot about the Golden Globes and Los Angeles, and you don't.  Also Erin, Nathan told me he lost your book.   Oy, With the Fishcakes Already!  (The template thing should be italicized, as not to drag attention away from the entry)

      all night, but oh well.)  In other words, show choir hell has officially started with 21 hours of Choreography in three days.  On the plus side, this show rules!  It is very awesome and I urge you to come see it.  Especially if you want to see me being ghetto, and all of our girls doing Kung Fu. (Actually it's more like kick boxing, but some of these girls trying to pull off 'tough' are downright hilarious.  Especially Amy and Laura.)       So yeah, if you think you've had an exhausting week, I advise you to think again.  Equally frustrating is that there is absolutely nothing cool for small, lightweight guys to do in a show choir show, and they won't let the girls lift me.       In other news, Heather Haywood and I are writing a scene together in Theatre arts about a feminist, an environmentalist, and a communist.  I think you can guess who I'm playing.

I've just been rather busy and/or rather lazy.  Your choice.  I'm really tired right now, cuz I just got home from a party (lots of drugs and sex, guys, I had a great time.  :D) and I only got 2 hours of sleep between the speech meet from hell and the party.  Btw, I got 8th for Humorous Interpretation (yay) and 2nd to last in all of my OI rounds.  Hmm.  So I'm actually alive and well.  Thanks.    Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

      My new semester schedule contains one highly awesome element:  As many lunches as I want!  Ok, well technically just whichever lunch I want but I can get away with more than one easily.  It just so happens that my North Star period (which is during a beginning journalism class, so I'm the only one in it) is during a lunch period.  Since I'm one person and the administration won't notice, Hayes said I can go to any lunch I want.  First day I went to two and he didn't notice.  If he asks, I was doing interviews. But other than that, the new schedule kinda sucks.  Two new teachers, one boring but nice and one who I thought was mean but she's just old.  I guess overall it's a wash.  In other news, The Pajama Game is a sexist musical.  It has three or four girls chorus songs, no guys songs and only about three that guys even sing on.  Being male chorus is quite pointless, particularly knowing I will be cut from all the dance numbers.  I'd better get lines, or else this musical will be a huge waste of my time.  There is one post left before the alphabet fails me, so please tell me what to do. Marten, you should bold the end thingy in the template so it doesn't blend with everything else.

Incase we have any uncultured whelps reading this blog, he plays the cello.  He plays it well.  Hurray for Momas who got tickets to see Yo Yo Ma!  If there's anyone here who doesnt know who Momas is, she is the mother of Thomas.  Mom + Thomas = Momas.    Then I came home.  Then I went away again.  Off to Christin Neary's birthday party.  Good food. Lots of people. and notice the sentence fragmens? Good device. Will be used more later.  Anywhy, parts of it were fun, other bits tasted good.  However, there was quite a bit of negative-marten energy there, so I was, for the most part, canceled out.  Sounds silly, but what can I do?  After that, Big Fish. It was fun.

      And so were the recaps. Seriously people, if you aren't watching  Joan of Arcadia , you should be.  Here's an excerpt from the fabulous Deborah's recap to entice you to watch... I'M QUOTING! BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CONSIDERATE PEOPLE DO! DON'T HURT ME!  "Kevin wheels into the kitchen, where the rest of the family is getting breakfast, reading the newspaper on his lap aloud to all: "'Chief Girardi's courage in confronting the corruption that has plagued Arcadia for years cannot be underestimated. He should be treated as a hero, not a pariah.'" Joan finds this odd and asks, "One of those flesh-eating Amazonian death fish?" Luke: "That's 'piranha.' A 'pariah' is an outcast, one of the unclean."" -Deborah on  Joan of Arcadia  1.12, "Jump"  Click this  urlLink link . Fufill your true nature.  Joan of Arcadia airs Friday at 8 on CBS.

      Okay, so it's not an actual quote, but I succesfully combined Lord of the Rings with Once in a Life Time. I get props. who coined that? Props to so and so. its actually kind of stupid and I never wat to hear it said again. Unless the speaker is refering to actual props for a play or something.   Ok, Michael, Im going to read the Alias recaps for the episodes I mised on TWoP.  Also, I'm going to ignore the squabble because I wasn't here. Also because I have divine right as administrator.  And because I think squabble is a dumb word.  reminds me of bad seafood. and notice the sentence fragments? good device. will be used more later  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      Joan Girardi has one. Rory Gilmore has one. Sydney Bristow has one. keckler has one. John Carter has one. Seth Cohen has one. Laynie Hart has one. Now Michael Christie has one too. I have an iPod! I finally fixed the port and I have music on there. Right now I'm listening to music from Finding Nemo.  There are about 11 intended links supposed to be up there. If you don't know who any of these people are, you don't watch enough TV. However, I'm nice enough to give you an idea: Joan of Arcadia, Gilmore Girls, Alias, Enterprise (recapper), ER, The OC and Everwood. Just go to your friendly search engine and type in "Television Without Pity" I promise I'll read a webcomic if you do this.

      I, too, am ignoring that squabble because it's over and moving on to say: That was definitely the best Joan of Arcadia ever! Hooray for Joan... or Jane, if you so prefer... and Adam! Good ripples all around. And definitely no weird scary koala bears in hats. Also, everyone, go see Big Fish. It is officially out now, and I saw a preview of it and it is such an awesome movie. It made me cry and laugh and everything. It's a brilliant film. Jonah, I want The Once and Future King back. Also The Da Vinci Code from Levi. You guys have had those for like six months. I've decided that I'm fixing the fanfiction recommendation of the week on Saturday, so here it is. You might not care, but I do. Another Lifetime by Kazzy, again for SW, again on fanfiction.net. I do read other fandoms and other sites, but these have just updated more. It's an AU where Padme doesn't die and is raising the twins, hopping from one planet to another and staying one step ahead of the Empire. Some very cute stories.  I shall now push "post and publish."  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      Nathan, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I completely and totally over-reacted.  And the rest of you thought this post would be all hostile.  Best Joan of Arcadia Ever! Yay! If you aren't watching now, you should be!  Here's the part of the post that was nice...  2.18 - 17 People  The episode that set up sweeps week, as well as the future of the show. Bartlet's MS is revealed to Toby, who freaks out and tears both Leo and Bartlet new cornchutes. (I actually would have enjoyed a scene where he goes off on the first lady and she slaps him. But this is a serious episode...) Meanwhile Sam and Josh try to write jokes for a speech for the Correspondent's Dinner. Sam invites Ainsley up to write jokes and the end up debating the Equal Rights Amendment. Powerful episode, masterfully captured by Alex Graves, who is probably the most talented director on the show since Schlamme left. Great acting from Marten Sheen, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney and Rob Lowe. However Richard Schiff turns in a powerhouse performance and steals the show and runs.  Also I don't understand dell. What is a dell exactly? And what does Dell Computers's catch phrase "Easy as Dell" mean. Cause it's stupid and I don't get it!

      I didn't read that post after the first sentence.  Nor will I.  I'm not going to retaliate.  I'm letting this go.  And even though you'll no doubt consider this a bunch of self riteous bs, I forgive you for that first comment.  It's not the kind of language I would use lightly.

      Micheal, I typed a rather long rant in reply to you, but then I deleted it.  I'm mad rght now.  I was already mad when I read you're post.  I snapped on five people today including both of my choir teachers.  So I figured it would only start a flame war.  So now I'm going to apologize for not explaining myself on the D&D topic, concede that I should have, and agree not to discuss it here.   I will not make the same concession for webcomics unless you do for TwoP, The West Wing, and basically every T.V. show you talk about that I don't watch.  You are holding a ridiculous double standard. Now I'm going to go take out my random, inexplicable anger on virtual characters in Super Smash Brothers.

      I don't know what the hell you are talking about. Quite frankly it's pissing me off more than a little bit. I loathe being outside of the loop. I also hate the fact that you cannot schedule an event without it being moved due to some previous obligation. On this note JournalCon is at 11:00 on the 31st of January. Come or don't, don't call before, just show up.  I'm probably expecting to much of you to even read this post. The webcomics are calling.  Okay...I've taken a few minutes, gotten a drink of water, had a shot of bourbon and now I'm back.  I propose a moratorium on Webcomics discussion, as well as whatever the hell DM is. Lord of the Rings dorkiness as well as things of actual substance are not banned by this bill, H.Con-175.   Vote in Comments (use Yay or Nay)  Also, Yond Nathan has a lean and hungry look;  He thinks too much, such men are dangerous.

      DMing is awesome!  But Marten, I've decided I can't do this with just two people.  I'm keeping the pirate theme, and I've expanded on it quite a bit.  I need a couple more weeks to get everything in order.  Meanwhile I've invited Paul and Tyler, and the invitation is still open to anyone else.  Especially Thomas.  Thomas, you in? Oh, By the way Thomas, you haven't posted because because time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so, and time has been moving very quickly for you, so what seemed like days to us was only about half an hour to you, which you spent eating lunch. That's my guess, anyway.  As for the Web comic talk, get in the game!  I have 11 that I check regularly.  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

Anyways, I'm happy with the websites I do go to and that's why I shan't be reading your other blogs or whatever it is ya'll are asking me to read.  So yeah.  Au Revoir.

      Sorry to post excessively, but I (being the Glark to Marten's Sars) have to inform readers and bloggers of the new features.  Comments. Point, type, shoot. Simple enough, eh.  I have one other request that I'd like to express. Can we lower the amount of webcomics talk, please? I always feel left out. Of course, I could rip out The West Wing episode reviews. I'm not kidding either. Seriously.  ALSO OUT OF SHEER NECESSITY, I HAVE TO ASK AGAIN FOR REPLIES TO MY GENEROUS JOURNALCON INVITATION. SINCE NONE OF THE RESIDENT FEMALES HAVE RESPONDED AT ALL, THIS IS NOW A SLEEPOVER EVENT!  urlLink RESPOND , DAMMIT!  I ALSO NEED LINK SUGGESTIONS FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS THEM!

      Thomas, I am really inclined to do that having been reminded of your prize winning convorsation. Oh wait you didn't win a prize. You didn't even enter? Ohhh Yeah...I'm really inclined to give you a reason.   I have one guess however because you're always online. You are playing games on the internet and never care enough to post on a collaborative blog.   Yeah I'm saber-rattling. I'm extraordinarily jet-lagged and am not in the mood to be screwed with.

      ...I'm really tired. I forgot what I was going to post about.  I'l probably ramble until it's more ridiculous than a Triangle and Robert Strip.  Speaking of the comic, I say all you non-readers read a bit so we can play the Triangle and Robert Improvisational Puppet show! (or TRIPS)  It's like a role playing game, but made to be silly, instead of silliness being made a mere possibility.    Michael, what is IKEA?

      Jonah, the bands at the Rose Parade had to do the same thing, but for five and a half miles. And one of the bands played Barry Manilow. Ew.   Read "Happy New Year" at my site! Coming today "20 Hours in America, Part One"

      Imagine holding five pounds of dead weight at level with your head, expending your air blowing into it while at the same time having to move forward, perfectly in step with those around you on uneven ground in unbearable heat. You are allowed to lower it from head to chest level for about four beats every three minutes.  Imagine this lasts three agonizing miles, while the people you walk by are sitting, laughing, and eating food. Keep that in mind the next time you watch a parade.  It's like gladiators - deriving pleasure from the pain of others.   Other than that, Arizona was great.  2nd place by a tenth of a point in the field show, 3rd in that cursed parade.  Saw the grand canyon, met some cowboys.  Met three to six wonderful girls from Maine and got e-mail addresses and even a phone number.  Marten suggested I refer to them as Xenophiles in my title because the were strangers who like me.  Xylophones is because we have them in our pit.  I must say, the grand canyon is absolutely amazing.  If you've never been there I highly recommend it.    Webcomic recommendation of the whenever is my official new section.  I'm going to kick it off with the ever popular Sluggy Freelance.  It's got Vampires, Aliens, Ferrets, and the like, but what makes it is the characterization and the quirky humor.  The page is www.sluggy.com.  The only drawback is the 7 years of archives, but if you find yourself with the internet and lots of free time, that is how I suggest spending it.  Thomas- I think you were eaten by a carnivorous moose from another planet.  You would be dead, except that just as you were being swallowed a space-time vortex opened and you fell into another dimension, specifically one populated by super intelligent tuataras, who made you their slave.  You were rescued by MacGuyver, who was thrown in by a similar vortex, and he created a dimensional flux agitator out of a pair of dirty socks, a toothpick, and some frozen orange juice.  However, the agitator wasn't perfect, so you ended up in the right dimension but the wrong planet.  MacGuyver made a spaceship out of some rocks, the agitator parts, and a captured turkey-like creature, but there was only room for one, so he left you behind promising to send help.  You waited for ten years and then gave up on that, deciding to find your own way home.  However, at the discovery of a mostly buried statue of liberty you realized that you were on earth, just in the future.  So you spent the next fifty years looking through the ruins of earth technology for a time machine.  The best you could find was a youth machine, which is why you still look 16.  You didn't find the time machine, but MacGuyver found you.  He had realized his mistake almost instantly, but because of relativity it took 60 years of your time for him to come back.  He was able to build a time machine with all the ruins you found, so you got back, only you were in New York.  Because you had no money you had to work as a taxi driver to raise the money, but while you were driving the taxi you got pulled into a web of mystery and intrigue revolving around a series of murders and a woman named Moreen LaRue.   Eventually you solved the mystery and got the girl, but she was run over by a speeding bus, so you returned here because you wanted to forget that other life and it's woes.  (I think I deserve a cookie for that.)   I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      Yeah, Eoywn rocks. Oh, hello. I didn't know anyone was here. Before you all start, the laptop died a horrible death on the fourth day of the trip, thus making me unable to update daily. I have some of my pieces in a notebook (sitting in my new Dead Tubey messenger bag) however the rest are on the laptop (probably in a warehouse somewhere)  Thomas, let me start out by saying welcome back. Also that people don't respond well to contests. Believe me. I know.  I'll be updating in a completely random order until I'm done, dammit.  Jonah: I tried desperately in vain to find the Fiesta Bowl parade, but I was in Pasadena at the time, and thats kind of like asking for Pepsi in Atlanta. Nathan: Crazy Idea! Don't try out for the play. You'll thank me on many a spring Saturday morning. Marten: IKEA! Erin: IKEA! Thomas: IKEA! Sophia: IKEA! (That rhymed. Hee.)  And...I'm spent.

      Marten says he couldn't see my last entry, so I'm posting it again.  Marten, I see you have started Monstrous Regiment. Isn't it special? It has some sort of dark parts later on, but I liked it.   Return of the King was so awesome! I finally saw it yesterday. Eowyn kicked the Witch King's ass! Ha ha! I especially enjoyed the adaptation for film of the above line. I forget exactly how it went, but I remembered that part from the book, so while I was watching, I was like, "Say it... say it..." And Frodo and Sam had some very nice love scenes. And there were oliphaunts!   Thomas, were you gone because you had to return a Ring, or possibly because you joined the army, or possibly because you fell into a parallel dimension?     I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

      Laugh at Soph, for she is out of a loop.  Few people at LC know, though.  I mean, conversations lead to it sometimes, but it seems weird to say to some people, hey, I have a girlfriend now!  Odd conversation starter, ya know? Props to Erin for an extremely long, extremely funny post.  It was so Random and out there, that I thought michael was writing it until i saw your name at the end.  Everybody check out the lobby! Its on the links, its my new journal site.   Hey, I have a girlfriend now!

      Erin, thanks for showing Soph what a decent-lengthed, interesting post looks like.  I think you get extra lint for that.  Thomas, you recieve the shame hat tonight.  Rules of the shame hat: It is worn until you post a post with atleast a hundred DIFFERENT words.  It would have just been until you post, but Nate and Sophia made me add the qualifiers.  There are instances wherein you can not wear the hat, such as the shower or while eating or praying or while the National Anthem is being played.  But generally, wear the hat.  If Marten reports to me that you are not wearing the hat we will devise stronger punishments. Now, match-up time!  Results of the last match:  It was cancelled on account of rain and will be rescheduled to late 2005.  New match:  A super-intelligent toothpick vs Alex Trebeck's hair in a competition to see who can take over the world first.  The only rules are no Microsoft and no Easy Cheese. Now, onto business:     I have nothing to say.  Thank you

      Yesterday was the most amazing day in the history of life in my house. I should have my own journal just so that I could write about it, but instead I'll write about it here.  It all began on Friday. Actually it began a few weeks ago when my grandmother brought over several pairs of underwear that were to big for her and thought that my mom might want them. She didn't. Fast-forward to Friday. Not having learned a single blessed thing and greatly overestimating my ass, Grandma brought over a pair of her underwear that were too small, thinking that I might want them. I don't. But my brother saw them and started teasing me about possibly keeping them. So, while he was in the shower, my mom prompted me to put them in his bed. I did so.  The next day at lunch, I asked if he had found them. Mom said yes, and he had put them on her head. He said that he'd found them at the foot of his bed. Mom told him that during the night they had been in his bed. "You slept with Grandma's underwear," she said. He immediately began to plot revenge.  That night, my mom discovered that all of her underpants were gone. Really gone. And in their place was an opera-ghost-like note declaring that there was no point in asking where they had gone, for revenge had begun so beware, etc.   Conveniently, my brother was in the shower again. He wouldn't say where the underwear had gone. While I combed the house, my mom turned on hot water in all the faucets hoping to give him a very cold shower. When she realized this would take too long, she filled a cup with ice cold water and poured it into the shower and onto the little miscreant's head. Still, he would not speak. So mom took all the towels out of the bathroom.  A moment later she realized that his pajamas were still in there, but by then he had locked the door. At first she tried to pick the lock with a bobby pin, but then we broke out the heavy machinery and removed the doorknob.   For some reason this didn't work, and by now the boy was out of the shower. Still no sign of the underwear. That was when he informed me that I hadn't even found out what revenge he had wreaked on me yet. I went into my room to discover what he had done.  The worst thing possible was that he had messed with my notebooks or folders or papers that are scattered about my room. He didn't do that. But he did do the second worst thing. He took my teddy bear. If you've ever been in my room, which none of you have, you'll know that I have several stuffed animals. But there is only one that matters. He is the definitive childhood teddy bear. And he was gone. I looked through the house again, but he was nowhere to be found.    About fifteen minutes passed. My mom couldn't get the knob back on the door until my brother unlocked it. He couldn't unlock it until the doorknob was back on. So, finally, he held his side of the knob in place while mom replaced her end and he unlocked the door. Then he went to hide behind the shower curtain because he was still naked. Bad move. And he still wouldn't reveal the location of the stolen things. Worse move. We took his pajamas.  Altogether, I would say that my brother was in the bathroom for about two hours last night. After his pajamas were gone, he refused to come out. We said we would give his pajamas back when he told us where our stuff was. He said he would tell us where our stuff was when he had his pajamas back. It was a standoff.   For me, it had stopped being so much fun when Teddy went missing. I suspect that my brother wouldn't hesitate to destroy the bear if he was upset enough. My mother gave up and we into her room to watch TV, waiting for him to streak across the hall. I sat in the hall and watched the door menacingly, preparing to shoot him when he emerged like I was Natalie Portman and he was a Yankee soldier threatening the safety of the World's Largest Baby.   After awhile I realized this was impossible because I had no rifle, so I went into his room again to search. This time I was successful. He had put my poor bear into his bass drum. He had played his damn drum set while poor Teddy was inside! I dismantled the front of the drum and rescued my teddy bear. Mom's underwear was still missing. Mom told me to leave the front of the drum dismantled.   After a few more minutes, Mom gave my brother his pajamas and told him to give her her underwear and he was grounded. When he realized she was serious, he did has he was told. It had been locked in a trunk in his closet.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the most exciting thing that has happened in my  house since I have lived there.  (Wow. Just like Sassy.)  Everybody, the Oscars are tonight, and if Renee Zellweger doesn't win, I want notes of consolation from all of you.    Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.

      I had the weirdest day at the gun show.  A random redhead started talking to me, and I ended up with her address.  House address. She's an hour away, so calling would be expensive, and she doesn't have a computer.  So summing up. Random cute redhead gives marten, who has a girlfriend now for those who don't know, her address. I have to write letters now. I mean, what can I do? She's going to find me at the next event anyway, so I cant ignore her. Besides, she seemed cool, I don't want to be mean.  But Kaylee will definately be a subject of my first letter, so she doesn't get any ideas.  Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.

      Props to Alex Richmond.  I did win a cough drop! It was wonderful. It tasted good and healed my raw and achy throat. It was like that thing that Galadriel gave Frodo in the Fellowship of the rings.  The Title refers to the unveiling of the new template, seen below. Isn't it hilarious! Shut up, Carrie.

      Or rather, of Marten, who won the quarter.  Michael got the cough drop and Erin, the next time I see her, will be awarded the lint.  Sophia and Nathan get imaginary cookies.  Thomas, however, has not posted and will recieve the hat of shame.  This is a paper hat that says  SHAME  on it in big black letters.  Now, Match up time. I put a lot of thought into the last match-up and decided that Stephen Sondheim, as a composer, might get distracted by the pitch and rythm of the little "bloop" noises and lose.  The pitbull, however, as a pitbull, has no opposable thumbs and isn't tall enough to reach the controls, so old Steve only has to hit the ball once.  Winner: Stephen Sondheim.  Next:  Claire Danes VS Natalie Portman in a waffle-eating contest.  Only the catch is that they are also riding on unicycles, and to win, one must eat the most waffles  and  survive the obstacle course without falling off of the unicycle.  Claire Danes is equipped with an industrial strength vacuum cleaner, and Natalie Portman has a huge autographed picture of the pope.  So, now, to business.  Michael - I am intrigued.  What does this bandwagon jumping entail?  Just that comic, or perhaps others?  Nate and Soph - Do you think those little short posts get you off the hook?  I want real posts or you'll all be wearing SHAME accessories.  (Personal Note: Must find a way to keep SHAME gear from becoming fashionable.) Marten- Today is the day I abuse an admin power.

      Darn you, Nathan and your inability to read prior posts! (Although I did notice you posted at 6 AM...) I have to ask all my questions again! Okay...Here Goes...  When is the blog going online? What is the name of the blog?  Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title?  Who is Joining the LN Blog?  Is Nathan going to be administrator?  Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium?  Is Marten Joining?  If Marten is joining can I join?   Answers would be appreciated!

      Number one reason I haven't been posting lately: Eighteen hour show choir competition.  It was really fun, though.  There was breakdancing and everything.   But I have had no sleep.  I require sleep to post.  Or at least I thought I did.  But apparently not.  Anyway, since then I can't stop dancing.  Whenever I hear a song I choreograph it in my head.  I think I may be turning into Micheal Humphrey.   Marten, does Kaylee read this blog?  It's just something I'd like to know.

      When Omar G., the Smallville recapper, writes webcomics, that will be the day that I jump on the bandwagon.

Renee Zellwegger kicked ass and earned all the awards she has won and/or will win on Sunday, Nicole Kidman was pretty and sad, Jude Law was sad and died, and Natalie Portman made a stirring appearance as the widowed and lonely mother of the world's largest baby. (It looked about half the size she is, probably partly 'cause she's so small.) She cried and then was almost raped and then shot a guy. Hooray. Jude Law is cute but not so much so with a beard. That's about all I have to say about that.  LC Players sucks. More on this later.  If I'm going to read The Other Side of the Corndog, or whatever it's called, somebody has to tell me exactly what it is. Either no one's ever said or I've missed it somewhere.  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      Props to Jonah for  urlLink jumping up and down on my already weak argument against euchre until it folded like a cheap card table   Yes the title is kind of a blatant attempt to  urlLink pimp    urlLink out   urlLink my   urlLink site . But it's also a query for information regarding the LN blog. I've got a bit of curiosity about this and a few concerns.  What is the name of the blog? Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title? Who is Joining the LN Blog? Is Nathan going to be admin? Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium? Is Marten Joining? If Marten is joining can I join?  When you get around to it, information about this would be greatly appreciated  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      I'm betting on Steve, as rabid pittbulls suck at pong. It might win at a game of snood, however.   Michael, you are disqualified from the jonah's pocket sweepstakes because you had been posting.  That means I get all the lint, the loot, and everything else at youth group.   I must appologize for the cuelty of my parents.  If it makes you feel better, I'm at my computer unable to work on my report because of my dad's horrible guitar playing.  You try and think with this racket.  Jonah, I don't understand the new scheme.  Everyone else, post, for the Admin. commands it. So the rest of you are also Admin.s, but I am the origional. It's like vampires. I'm the Admin. King. But thats about it. I have nothing else to say. Except that I took Kaylee out to see Tech's Faculty musical! Well, technically my dad took us, as well as my sisters, but we had fun anyway. More on this later, probably in the lobby(check the new links)  There are times for breaking down, and then there are times to get Funky. This is one ofthose Funky times

      Jonah, you owe me the current contents of your pocket.  I've seen all the movies nominated for best picture at the Acadamy Awards this year! Ranked in Order from best to worst:  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Mystic River Lost in Translation Seabiscuit Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World  I really don't have much to say, except I have to go see Miracle because  Jonah has a work ethic and Marten's parents are unsympathetic to my plight of having to go see a cheesy inspirational sports movie.  I'm done. Check out the new links! -> But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

      It's 10:06 and I have to be at school at 6:30 tomorrow morning, but for the love of the blog, I'm posting anyway!  Let this be an example to you all.  Anyway... Match up time.  The monkey was eliminated after it starved to death out of fear of eating the wrong bananas.  Patrick Moore tried to use his Xylophone skills to make the dancing Martians attack, but they were to caught up watching Lardman dance.  Meanwhile, the snake bit Patrick, the badgers out-danced Lardman and shamed him out of the cage, and the mushrooms ate the aliens.  This seemed like a shoe-in for the badger-mushroom-snake team, but the wrong bananas themselves came out of nowhere and defeated them, which goes to show you that you can't underestimate a banana (a recurring theme in my work, as  Corndog  readers can testify to.  Next match-up:  A single game of the original Pong between Steven Sondheim and a rabid pittbull.  So, in other news, I finally saw  Camp! .  If you haven't seen it yet you don't know what you're missing.  Sexual confusion, musical numbers, and big-hair are just a few reasons.  Also the randomly appearing main title which is sometimes backwards. I'm going to a speech meet tomorrow to compete in Poetry.   I swore I would never do that again, because the only poems I do are humorous, whereas the only poems that place are written by 7-year-olds with cancer about life in Auschwitz.  And if you've got a poem like that (and 90% of them do, 70% probably have the same cancer-holocaust poem) who needs talent?  Meanwhile, the three of us out to prove that it doesn't have to be depressing to be poetry get consistently creamed.  Ah well.  Btw, I'd encourage you all to head down to Michael's new site and post more comments that disagree with him about Euchre, but first - POST HERE!!! As in incentive, the next person to post will get a quarter or a cough drop or a piece of lint or something the next time I see them.  For FREE.  It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals with which they treat your dashboard.  P.S. Isn't it weird that the Blogger spell check doesn't know the word Blog?

      Tomorrow is the sixth month anniversary of the first entry at Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog. I just felt that should be pointed out. Let me be the first to extend Jonah congratulations on six months of hilarity, Norwegians and cod analogies. May there be many, many more.  Jonah also has been busy elsewhere as he has taken over my old site, which has moved to a new address  urlLink here  I wish he would have come up with something less obvious than changing one word in the title, but hey, what can you do...  Incidentially, because I know that this is going to come up, I am posting at the same rate that I normally do. You are all just posting dramatically less. Just wanted to point that out so that we don't have another "You're taking over the blog!" controversy. Just for the record: Marten last posted 11 February, Erin last posted 15 February, Sophia last posted 15 February, Nathan last posted 16 February, and Jonah last posted 10 February. Basically I'm saying post more! I'm bored and lonely here!  It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat your dashboard with.

      I have big news.  I'm moving What Kind of Day Has it Been to a new host.  I'm going to keep the archives up here at blogspot, but I'm moving the Journal part of the site to SquareSpace, where you will get to access a special section of the website. Cool, huh? But the journal is prettier and I like it a whole lot better.  I'm just going to blog right here from Compendium for daily crap.  I'd like to remind you of this. My site is very nice, and you might enjoy it, But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!  ETA: Journal is  urlLink here

So I'm taking large amounts of Schadenfreude in Nathan's unfortunate haircut. And now I'm going to go sit in the basement, play video games and wait to be hit with the massive amount of inevitable Karmic backlash coming my way.  ETA: Erin read  urlLink this  It's the recap of the episode of ER where Romano's arm got chopped off. And it's HILARIOUS! But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

      My haircut sucks.  The woman cut off way to much and now I have androgynous 80's hair.  I'm not in the best mood ever.  Also, I'm going back to my old title scheme with slight modification.  Songs from musicals, names of musicals, and quotes from musicals.  It will not change again. And the good news.  This is the last braces wire I'll ever wear!  April 7th they come off for good! JournalCon was fun, but you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!  And compared to that....  I still prefer JournalCon.  Definately.

      Today blew. First of all it was laundry day. Secondly just as we were planning what to do today, Tim came up and started horking all over everything. So now Tim has the flu, I'm bored the hell out of my mind and I just realized I missed The Simpsons.   ETA: Then I watched Alias and was happy again. Then I was sad and depressed afterwards. Now I'm kind of happy because I had pancakes for breakfast! "Guess what Flappy! I'm not going to kill you yet!" And Tim isn't sick anymore! So we're going  downtown !   Erin - The whole Chicago, Chicago, Toronto thing isn't bothersome online. It's when Marten proceeds to...cackle it continuously that it grates on my nerves.  Marten - Please remove your crap from my house.  But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

      I only pressed post, not post and publish with that last entry, and I want to make sure it gets up, so I'm posting it again. Sorry for the inconvenience.  JournalCon was fun. Even though I only sat through two episodes of Sports Night. And wasn't really paying attention to them, but rather to the journal of Anakin Skywalker, which was, well... wizard.  And let me be the first person to annoy Michael and say...  "Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago TORONTO!"   But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

LOST & FOUND: Marten, you forgot your games and your memory card. Did anyone forget a stick of deodorant?  That was fun. We really need to do it again sometime. Season Two is waiting...

However she did get to wear a hilarious wig on LC Current so all is good.  I really don't know what I'm doing here except to trumpet "JOURNALCON!"   Edited to add: I remember what I wanted to say. I may be downstairs in the basement when y'all arrive. If I don't respond to the doorbell walk around back down the sidewalk, down the steps and into the back yard. I'll be there, and the door will be unlocked  Hopefully, Y'all check before you come!

      I've gotten confirmation from Thomas and almost confirmation from Erin. However Thomas does not lend his name to a semi-hilarious Sports Night reference, Ergo "Erin's Coming, Hide Your Heart Girl.  JournalCon. Tomorrow at Six. Michael's House. E-mail me  urlLink here   for additional information and stuff.  PS I have  Chicago . And by the way movies and stuff need to be italicized 'cause I thought Marten wanted to go to Chicago for a JournalCon, which would be...easy, now that I know the secret entrance (Stony Island Avenue!) but expensive to say the least.   However it would be cool...  History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

      Huzzah! New schemes, and journalcon is finally happening.  Chicago is a must at some point. For some reason I still don't own it.  I also must show those of you who are familiar with Triangle and Robert, namely Nathan and Jonah, my new parody.  I got bored in math and started drawing polygons, and it turned into an alternate T&R universe.  Enter: Thomas and Rhombus.  Its not just a crappy hack of the origional, Ive got interesting ideas, it works. just read it.  Its wacky and absurd in a whole new sense of the word(s).  I don't like Phillipy.  I do like showing him up with well done assignments.  The battle continues.  History is a giant crack.   Sorry, I couldn't help myself

      At the suggestion of Michael, my new title scheme is animal group names.  When I run out, 'll make them up.  The winner of the last match-up is Mary Poppins, which is surprising insofaras she wasn't a competitor.  See, Larry ate his mount and his lance, and Helen Keller headed off in the wrong direction.  Neither of them really won, so Mary Poppins was declared the winner by default, as was laid out in the original plan. The New match-up: Who would win in a steel cage death match between Patrick Moore (with Xylophone), a badger (with mushroom and optional snake), a monkey (with the wrong bananas), and Lardman (whose life is an exciting adventure). Feel free to post comments on how the match might play out or comments to the effect of "You are a silly English Kee-Niggit!"  For Research:  urlLink www.weebls-stuff.com  and  urlLink Rather Good   Journalcon will be Bizzawesome I am sure, and I will be there with or without bells on, probably without.   Those of you who are not reading  urlLink Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog  are doing yourselves a disservice. Or atleast doing me a disservice.  Anyway, Erin atleast understands the importance of feedback for good writing, so read and post please.  History is about to crack wide open. Hold on to something.

      Okay. Here's the plan for JournalCon. Everyone arrive at 6:00. We'll eat pizza (by the way my parents won't be home for some of the time, that does not mean that drinking or other badnesses are allowed) I'm hoping to finish season one of Sports Night. That is my goal, however if you are all bored, we can do other stuff. People need to bring snacks. Erin (if she comes) and Sophia will leave by 11:00 (at my parents behest) and we'll...do stuff. The Comstocks are coming around 9:00 so we'll watch Joan of Arcadia then.  Now I know that Erin, Thomas, Sophia and Nathan are unfamiliar with Sports Night so I have compiled a quickie "previously on" segment  Previously on Sports Night: Casey and Dan were Anchors, Dana was Producer, Natalie was Executive Producer, Issac was managing editor, Jeremy was...something else, Sally was the skanky ho who ran the 2:00 update. Here's where it gets complicated...Casey loves Dana, who is in love with Gordon. Natalie is hellbent on getting Dana and Casey together, however Dana is uninterested because she doesn't think that Casey is really interested in her. Natalie liked Jeremy and they were really cute together. Natalie got sexually assualted by a football player and the crew worried about the fallout, which never came.  Now I also know that Jonah, Nathan, Sophia, and Thomas are unfamiliar with Joan of Arcadia so I have compiled another "previously on" segment here  Previously on Joan of Arcadia: The Girardi family picked up and moved to the titular town of Arcadia, Maryland. Joan talked to God, who appeared to Joan in different (and frequently hilarious) forms, befriended Adam, an artist, and Grace, the militant...I don't know how else to describe her. The dad, Will, was a police chief, the mom, Helen, was a secretary at the school. The older brother, Kevin, was a baseball player who was injured in a car accident resulting in his being in a wheelchair. The Youngest child, Luke is a geeky kid who really reminds me of the Comstocks. Adam's Mom had died. God told Joan to do random stuff, which would benefit somebody in someway (a friend, a child, a teacher etc...) One of these things was to keep one of Adam's (the Artist's) sculptures out of the school art fair, she had a 'failure of imaginiation' and ended up smashing the sculpture with a chair. This worked out badly, as Adam came in just as she did this. So Adam and Joan had a falling out. Eventually Joan and Adam made up after Helen befriended Adam and Grace Helen and Joan intervened and helped Adam read his mom's suicide note, which was pleasant and left good ripples. So Adam and Joan kissed and the world went 'SQUEE!'. Also Grace and Luke kissed at a dance then worked together on the science fair, leading to a really cool Goldbergian sequence of events that lead to the previously mentioned kissing. So they're kind of together. Kevin got a job at a newspaper which lead to him making out with his boss, Rebecca (who is Sydney Poitier's daughter). Will discovered massive corruption at the city level and squealed to the FBI which lead to the dissolution (I think that's a word) of the Police Department. So now he's a Detective and the man who provided the information is the new police chief. Whew!  Come at Six, Girls leave at Eleven, Guys leave whenever the next day.  History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

      Okay, I'm starting to think that we need to get Sophia a massive Thorazine drip. I'm sorry I missed the thespian play, I was in Chicago and I got brochures out the wazoo. However, I would enjoy watching it on video. Ha! Bwah Ha Ha Ha! Even  I  didn't believe that! I really don't have anything to say except that I'm blogging from the school library where there has been no appearance of the Killjoy. Thankfully. Hey! Look! It's an actual class coming in to do actual research in the actual library. You know we have about ten computer labs why don't teachers take advantage of those? By the way, links probably won't be up for a while, because I don't care that much.   History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

So I'm alive, too, and just thought you might care to know that.  Oh, and the play last night wasn't THAT bad.  It was kinda funny.

      Great Job, Nathan. You might as well have just said MacBeth! Also LNTV? Is that like announcements? Because that would just be mean. Also because it bears repeating,  Start Your Own Blog.   In unrelated news, Break A Leg, Erin! And Massive Props to Marten!  In a completely unsurprising twist the italicization of the blog can be attributed to one Marten "Glutenous Polypeptide" Dollenger. See my post "I am on my way. When I am manifest, our work begins..." wasn't italicized when I posted it. But it was after Marten posted his silly post. So it's all Marten's fault.  Also Comments are down until I get back from Chicago. Sorry!

      The new title scheme is in, it is science fiction quotes.  Which means mostly Star Wars, Trek, Gate and really good Babylon 5 or Farscape or some even more obscure show.  Musical songs was getting tedious. I want admin powers.  If you give me admin powers, I will give you chocolate.  if you don't, I will kill this innocent little llama.  The choice is yours. There is now one major male part in the musical left to assign, and three guys left without parts.  The other two are both dancers who can't act (or, in Micheal's[not you!] case, sing).  Which means, most likely, Chad will get two parts.  Barring that, I probably have it, but I really wish she'd announce it soon.   I have decided not to do choir next year.  I'm probably going to take LNTV instead. Good luck tonight to Marten and Erin.  Nothing else to say. The vegetable must be destroyed!  Cast it into the garden in which it was grown!

      I don't anticipate many updates this week, so I'm just going to have to be clever and write posts so the awful italics (all M ichael 's fault, despite what he says. All his fault, people) will go away.  I am totally in love with Tony Kushner's "Angels in America". It's a play about people, all of them flawed, living in America and either dealing with AIDS and Homosexuality on a first hand level. But despite some...bizarre content (angel sex. which is a lot creepier than it may sound. Even if the angel does look like Emma Thompson) the writing is beautiful and the play is sweeping and epic. And the angel is really cool.  I'm seeing Designing Murder* on Thursday. Is it anything like Designing Women? Is it about several white southern women who have hilarious misadventures in a large house in Atlanta? Cause that would be cool.  *Yes I know, It's "Design For Murder", but for the sake of the joke...

      Okay, that last post was short just so that I'd win in the contest I had going with Marten over who could post that tickets were on sale first. As far as further information goes, they are 6 and 8 dollars at the LC box office. If you buy them on Tuesday you get entered in a raffle to win a hundred dollar Simon Mall gift certificate.  Design for Murder kicks ass. It has murder and intrigue and peope oozing sex and me in a wig. It's really a good play, which is why we blew everyone else out of the water at regionals yesterday.  I don't want to comment on the other plays there. That would make me sad. Except to say that the straight version of the Scarlet Pimpernel was the worst one, and one of the people in the cast wore tennis shoes. In Cheaper By the Dozen almost everyone wore no shoes. And the name of one of the chorus girls in Little Shop was Bingbing Chu. I am not making this up.    Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

      Got back from Thespian regional conference last night.  To sum it up, everybody sucked but us, with the exception of Why Do We Laugh, and the dentist's pants in Little shop of Horrors. I'll leave the rest of the actual plays to Erin. I signed up for an Improv workshop, which would be more fun if almost everyone didn't suck at it. Questions only was fun, though, I wiped the floor with those would-be Inquisitors.     Michael -When did you see the books?  Did you see my  The Almost Complete Works of ?   Nate -We don't constantly talk of lc teachers. I just described him, anyway, rather than just throwing him i a post expecting you to know about him.  And I'm with Michael on the matter of recruitment, we have plenty of bloggers.  Maybe you should start a mostly LN blog.  Only you, Jonah and I even know Tyler and Paul, so you could be admin to a sort of sister blog to Compendium. An affiliate, if you will.    Everyone -Buy tickets for Design for murder!

      Today is Ewan McGregor's birthday! Yay!  Irrelevant spoiler of the day: Palpatine is the Phantom Menace! I know, you never saw it coming. But, you see, all of the dark side stuff and the crumbling of the Republic-- he engineered all of that. It was all part of his plan! He is Darth Sidious! And since he is menacing the Republic and no one knows it's him... that makes him... the Phantom Menace! Sio Bibble was a pretty good red herring, though. Next time: Anakin is WHO?

      Wow, in all the excitement of my last post it seems that I forgot completely about the irrelevant spoiler of the day! Let me amend that now.  Who is the father of Padme's twins? Well, Threepio and Artoo were eliminated for technical reasons, although they couldn't quite understand why. To Padme's dismayed surprise, Master Yoda bowed out citing that he was a different species, although he would not disclose any further specifics. Then, after Padme had spent some time counting backwards on her fingers, Mace and the coffee guy were also eliminated. The coffee guy ran from the room in tears. Count Dooku left quietly because, let's face it, he's about eighty and he didn't want to face this kind of embarrassment. Palpatine soon followed suit. This left Anakin, Obi-Wan, Captain Typho, and George Lucas. Captain Typho was eliminated when the handmaiden Dorme jealously stepped forward and spat, "He was with ME that night." Obi-Wan and Anakin then engaged one another in a duel, while George looked on and laughed maniacally. Just when it seemed that this might go on forever, the paternity test results came back. They revealed that the father was, indeed, Anakin Skywalker. He enthusiastically embraced his wife, while over his shoulder, she and George exchanged a wink. Everything was going as planned... Next time: So, just who IS the Phantom Menace?   It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

      Except that it is.  Happy Spring Break everybody! Woohoo! I will see many of you at JournalCon 1.5: Hobbits Gone Wild. I can name it that if I want.  I got Wyrd Sisters back from Mrs. Grabill today after a long four or five-month absense! (The DaVinci Code is still out however... ) Also, Michael is reading The Light Fantastic! All in all, this is a big Discworld day for me.  I'm so excited about this spring break. Aside from doing nothing, I plan to do lots of things. But don't worry, they're things that basically amount to nothing. Like working on my senior year scrapbook and my Star Wars album (I hope to bring that on Tuesday to show off, 'cause it's pretty) and I plan to attmept my very first post on fanfiction.net. I'm going to fix up Dex's Diner and stick it up to test format. Plus I'm almost done with my Velma Kelly story. And I need to finish my Ani/Padme essay. And make some headway in "Surrender." But it's all okay, because I feel like I've got a good burst of creative energy going.  So everybody wish me luck! Yay!

      Woohoo, I'm Delivery Man!  I must only use my power for good.  This is going to be awsome, and I pity you losers who can't go.   So what is new for me?  I switched from chemistry to latin for next year.  Apparently I can't take chem unless I take algebra 2 at the same time.  I'm worried about latin, though.  It sounds like work, and I've already got a lot of that for AP.  I might still switch to etymology, but I don't know.  Latin seems interesting.

      As the title suggests, I'm pretty damned tired right now. I'm also posting here to announce details of JournalCon 1.5!  Where: My House. I'm not putting my address here. You've been there before, you know where it is. When: 12:00 on Tuesday March 30th, 2004 Why: To Snark and write a fan-fic send-up of Lord of the Rings Who: Any Blogger in Indianapolis and not Florida or the Caribbean.  Food Details: Either we can do pizza, or we can all give Marten $10 bucks and he can pick us up Panda Express. If anyone else likes that idea, IM me with your order. I recommend the Orange-Flavored Chicken. Drinks and snacks will be provided. Also: JournalCon 2: Electric Boogaloo is coming... The following is a preview of Sports Night: Season Two.  Dana: Stand there. I'm gonna sack you. Jeremy: Okay, I need just another moment of your time, then you can go back to being crazy.  Dana: My brother can beat up your brother. Natalie: My brother's a grad student in comparative literature. My mother could beat up my brother.  Dan: Honesty for Pixley!  Sam: Dana, I have been through alcohol, marriage and network television. If you want to kill me, you're gonna need some kryptonite.  Casey: I didn't do the bread. Dan: What'd you do? Casey: I did what I do, Dan, I did what I do. Dan: You screwed up your romantic life in front of fifth graders?  Casey: I could be like a blind detective, have my own TV show. Dana: You DO have your own TV show.  Isaac: Does the porn star know you're this much of a dork?  Isaac: The kid can't even walk yet. Why are we locking the medicine cabinet? Dana: Does he crawl? Isaac: Not up walls, no.  Natalie: "Jeremy, one day you'll see that my love for you isn't the product of liquor-induced mood swings and that I'm yours for the taking at your command and that the day I broke up with you is the most regrettable day of my life. " Jeremy: "Okay, but I broke up with you." Natalie: "I find you loathesome, and my hatred of you knows no bounds."  Dana: "That's right. My show is on. My show is on! My show is on! My show is ON!"  Casey: "...with revenge on their minds they welcome the Tigers to the house that Ruth built this evening." Dan: "Excuse me, Casey, but Ruth didn't build the house this evening, did he?" Casey: "No, Dan, and thank you very much for correcting my every mistake no matter how small, oh these many years." Dan: "What are friends for?" Casey: "To annoy the hell out of you?" Dan: "Exactly." Also, just a thing. Please restrict templates to one or two lines, otherwise it ends up awkward.

      Branson, MO, is without a doubt the cheesiest city in the united states, possibly the world.  This makes it absolutely perfect for a National show choir competition.  I've come to the conclusion that when a person does show choir long enough, that huge cheesy smile becomes a permanent facial feature, and they can't turn it off.  And having 16 choirs worth of show choir people in one place for 4 days only compounds the problem. In all seriousness, though, it was really fun in a cheesy sort of way.  You know what else is true about show choirs?  They tend to attract their share of, shall we say, loose women.  I talked to a girl for maybe twenty minutes on Saturday before she tried to kiss me.  When I told her I had a girlfriend, she immediately moved over to Cristian, stealing him from one of her friends.  Yeah.  Truth be told, the nicest girl I met was a lesbian.  Despite all this, or maybe in part because of it, hanging out with the Chesterton girls was really fun. I also saw some amazing show choirs.  I won't bore you with details, except to say that the 2nd place group did all music by Journey and it rocked.  Also Kevin and Donald from Moby Dick were in the fourth place choir, and Kevin tried to show up the Ben Davis flip guy, but fell short.  Literally. We ended up getting 9th out of 16, which is really not bad for us.  Hip Street got 6th and won best tech crew, and Ben Davis got 2nd.  Ming Chan suprised everyone by getting best female performer, despite not having any solos or being featured in any way. More later when I have time.  It's good to be back.   By the way, if you want to see our shows, we're doing them for the last time ever on Wednesday at 7:00.  Price is $2.00.

      Haha, John Dimmick!  I know him!  I drove to choir with him in...8th grade?  I think?  So about this board, I get to be an administrator!  Yay!  I have no idea what to do or what kind of stuff I'd be expected to do, but I can assure you that I will do this to the best of my ability.  :D  And I ALSO get to be a girl.  Wow.  I'm so honored.  And now I think I'll go shower...although you probably don't care.  Oh well.  Au Revoir, amigos...  The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

      Props to John Dimmick for a really really good idea that I totally just stole.  I'd like to start off by saying that this post is a completely new post on a completely different day and with Marten, Thomas and Nathan out of town, it may seem like I'm posting a lot and if you're offended by this...well...bite me. The juniors (in Inter-disc) at LN have created a board to discuss...stuff. School, Current Events, Homework and other things. It's a really good idea, and now, for the first time ever, I present to you  urlLink THE LC INTER-DISC/AP BOARD ! Or LCIDAPB! No actually that's a really sucky acronym. But I really, really need your help. Tell everyone who's going to be in either Inter-Disc English/US History or AP English/US History to come here and debate and chat and stuff. By the way, Marten and Thomas are my official mods. Sophia, by virtue of being a girl gets to be a girl. No wait, Sophia gets to be the other admin.  The Great Work Begins...

      I love Orange-Flavored Chicken. I am officially going to marry Panda Express. Or at least buy stock in them. I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which was weird for the sake of being weird. But good. It was nice. That was a joke you would find funnier if you saw the movie. Only one Caveat emptor: the movie, despite the presence of Jim Carrey isn't terribly funny. It's funny at times. Just don't go in expecting massive hilarity, because there's not much there. However do go in with the idea that somewhere around the 1:30 mark, you're going to see Kirsten Dunst in her panties. So it's still totally worth nine bucks.  Also I added a Site Meter. How many times can six people visit the same site? ' I'm gonna find out if it kills me, dammit! The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

      Damned hypothetical questions! I've got nothing at this point.  If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? Sophia:  probably something super-random...like tacos and ice cream!  [Actually, there's a place that sells tacos and ice cream at 86th & the Monon Trail in Nora. True Story --Michael]  Michael:  It'd be Mediterranian cusine -- Tapas, Hummus, Pizza, Gyros and...whatever they eat in Croatia  Jonah: Bagel sandwiches.  It'd be like Subway meets Einstien Bros. Marten: I'd open a bar. Maybe a cafe. Nathan: Fondu! 2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? Sophia:  Books.  My personal favorites.  :D Michael:  Records, like in High Fidelity. Jonah:  Stuff like they sell at Spencer Gifts, only slightly more clean. Marten:Odd but useful inventions, like toilet seat warmers and icecream scoop heaters. Nathan: I'd specialize in out of print or discontinued merchandise, for a horribly inflated price. 3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? Sophia:  Probably a criminal psychology book...about the reason people kill or something. Michael:  Sex Education...for virginal adults! Jonah:   Whatever the toaster story is or else speculative fiction. Marten: Satire and odd fantasy Nathan: Sci-Fi, disguised as reference 4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? Sophia:  Psychology. Michael:  Martial Arts and Bagpipe Lessons Jonah:  Free thinking - Kinda like Dead Poet Society Marten: I'd help Jonah Nathan: World Domination. Then when one of my pupils succeeded I'd be in his favor.  Or he'd kill me so I could teach no one else.  It's all good.  5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? Sophia:  Yeah, like I know that.  Probably some stuff from musicals or something. Michael:  Really Bad Music. Jonah:  Some musical stuff, some classic rock, some Christian Rock, some instrumental jazz and a few original compositions. Marten: Jonah, you keep stealing mine! I'll add video game music to that list Nathan: Something totally new.  Something that cannot be defined by an existing style, but would start a movement and revolutionize music.

      Yeah, from what I hear we're definitely not doing a musical. I'm sad about that, but what can ya do? At least Haley Jensen won't be getting the lead in it. Irrelevent spoiler of the day: Not only is Padme pregnant, she's pregnant with TWINS! Next time: Who's the father? Is it Obi-Wan? Anakin? Bail Organa? Captain Typho? Mace Windu? Yoda? C-3PO?

      Jonah: You are a nice person! In any event you got your ass kicked by Marten shortly afterwards. Also the whole Claire (who I actually liked) vs. Jonah thing was kind of my idea. So some if not most of the blame lies with me. Also, I heard that we might do a musical revue instead. Which sounds bad, but then again so did the musical in drag. Also you (and Nathan) will be greatly missed at LotRJournalCon.   The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

      I am a horrible person. Those of you who were at my party may recall an incident between my friend Claire and I that ended with a slight injury to her shoulder.  Well, today she's in a sling.  I have no idea how it happened, I didn't push her that hard, but anyway, now I feel awful.  To make matters worse, John Murray came up to me yesterday at the Jazz Band concert and said, "So, I hear you beat up Claire.  Good Job."  So now everyone at school thinks I just beat up girls or something.  Of course, I haven't actually seen Claire, so this could be an elaborate scheme to get back at me by making me feel bad.  I'll know in about 40 minutes. (I'm in Journalism now, I'll see her at lunch)  Either way, I'm going full Pacifist.  No more fighting for Jonah.  EDIT:  Yep, she's in a sling.  Also, it's her birthday today.  Can you believe that? Ugh.  On the plus side, she's not actually mad at me.   In other news, the Jazz Band concert was awesome.  I wasn't planning to go, but Swathi and I decided just to stay after musical practice, go out to eat, and then go to the concert - which turned out to have not only jazz, but also dancing and food.  Of course, I couldn't get Swathi to dance until the last song, but it was fun still.  I also had another interesting conversation with a Ms. Oed whom some of you know.  I met her at a party awhile back, but I thought she was one of those nice people I'd never see again.  Given our mutual involvement in Band an Drama and our tendency to attend the performances of each other's schools, I think I'll see her again.  She also shared an interesting tidbit with me:  The rumor is LC will not have a musical this year.  Can you guys confirm or deny?  Match ups.  I have to say the deaf.  Sight is simply more important to basketball than sound.  Even if the blind can yell their plays to each other, it's still the blind leading the blind.  Next match-up: A watermelon versus a slightly larger watermelon, in a pole-vaulting competition.  Marten - Kaylee wants someone's dad's shoes back and soon!

      It all began with a game. The best game ever. The "Oh, Snap!" Game. This game is simple and can be played by anyone. You do a movie line, then insert the phrase. Here's an example. ANAKIN: You are in my very soul, tormenting me. PADME: Oh, snap. That wasn't the best example, but it was the first one that came to mind. So, anyway, Michael and I were just playing that game with LOTR. Then we started randomly parodying it, which turned out to be something that sounded a lot like  urlLink The Shifty Troublemaker , i.e. hilarious. (You all would know that if you'd READ IT, but I digress.)  So, what we want to do is a compendium LOTR MST-ish spoof. The plan is for everybody who'll be in Indy on March 30 to go to Michael's house and watch Fellowship and provide commentary. Those who won't be there will catch up later. If you're unsure about this, well... Frodo: I cannot do this alone. Sam'd go (Dance Move) I'd go (Dance Move) We'd go (Dance move). But I simply cannot do it A-LONE!  [That was totally my quote. --Michael]  Galadriel: You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone. I have to go, I'm being yelled at.

We now return you to your regular case broadcasting.  Jonah: Also, I didn't get an e-mail. Don't you like me? Also Also*, James Band?   Also the Statute of Limitations** starts today, the new template (courtesy of Thomas) can be entered 21 March 2004. Also new additional good sense Template Rule: The person who entered the template identifies themselves in a post, so that no one can hog the template for two weeks in a row. Thomas has it this week, we'll randomly choose next week.   * Yes I meant to double the Alsos. ** Sports Night Reference! It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

      I'm never planning a big party again.  This is going to be a disaster and it'll be all my fault.  Why did the two most disorganized people on the planet have to try to do this?  If you don't know what I'm talking about check your e-mail for your last minute invitation.  Anyway the match-up today, meaning no disrespect to either of the organizations, is a Basketball game between the Indiana School for the Deaf and the Indiana School for the Blind teams.  Results of last match up: James band cleverly used the hat to convince the toothpick that he was a time traveller on his way to erase the toothpick from history.  The toothpick, racing to stop him, tried to slingshot around the sun and got pulled in and incinerated.  Meanwhile the hair, seeing the vest, gave up on life entirely and exploded.  Bond thus saved the world once again.  I went on the Monon trail today with Marten and Michael (and Sam, who deserves massive props for putting up with us).  It was fun, but now I have to write the story. Ugh. BTW Marten, I still say we put the tagline in italics.   This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.

      Okay, I'm going to suggest official rules to template changes, and other things.  Anyone can change the following things: Template(little thing at the bottom of each post), Description, and the Copyright thing on the side. It doesn't have to stay a copyright Details: Any of the above things may only be changed if the current setting has been there for a week(seven [7] days or more) or after fifteen (15) or more posts, no more than three per person.  Exceptions made for blog member birthdays and other special occasions.  sound good? oh, and maybe another unofficial rule, could we keep the templates to 1 or 2 lines in length? they get annoying to read when they're too long.

      Here's the quote that should be in Jonah's Monon Trail article but isn't: "The Monon Trail is for health nuts and people who like boring things." Youth Group was like I predicted, like having hot pokers shoved down my throat. Hot pokers of fun! It was actually fun, because of the pizza and the Comstockery and the fact that everyone there pretty much has ADD and Patty reminds me of every Elementary school teacher I've ever had, trying desperately (and failing to keep me on task.)  Also the "Meryl Streep is the Meryl Streep of Acting!" article came from  urlLink here . There's Chicago stuff for Erin there as well, which brings me to my second point. I am spoiler free for Episode Three, which is to say that I really don't give a crap one way or another, but I am a "Spoiler-Whore for Episode IV!" (It's funny because it already happened.)

      It just occurred to me that at this point I probably ought to say that you "Spoiler-Free Till Episode III" people are big losers, and I am going to torture you to your breaking point.

      Well, I'm back from Hanover. I left for their sholarship competition stuff on Friday at about 12:30 and got home at about 4:30 yesterday. Then I went to church until 6:30 and my cousin's birthday party until 10:00. But now I'm home. I missed home. Overall, the competition went pretty well, although I'm not expecting to get more scholarship money out of it. But I stayed in a dorm with some really nice girls and, overall, it was a good experience. I hope I never have to do it again. I'll go and answer the Friday Five now, even though it's Sunday.

Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?

      I really dont like the phrase "How are you?" All the possible answers are boring and grammatically incorrect.  How am I what? It's just a stupid question.  Speaking of how I am, or rather waht i did, I spent my half day at the mall with Kaylee.  more on this at the lobby.  Props to Michael for burning the soundtrack to Lost in Translation for me. Awsome set of tunes. (  Sophia: Thanks, I owe it all to chlorine and spin-drying my hair.   Michael: you're right.  It would be odd. To begin with, anyway. I'm trying to imagine you in the same room with Patty and Jen   Nate: I consider your silence a personal victory.    Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?

      I'm having troubles with my church. Yes I know, but it's really starting to bug me. I used to help out with two/three year olds on Wednesday Nights while their parents were at Bible Study. This worked out since my parents came to help with my brothers youth group and I had tried my youth group and found it to be...well bad. It was bad. It was really really bad. It was just...bad. So I helped out and for about a year, I did that and I had fun doing it. I got to play with babies for an hour and a half, sometimes we'd go to the big playground, othertimes not. Then last November, the lady who ran the problem told me that the new senior minister (who I pretty much instantly disliked) had decided that 8:00 was too late for two/three years old, and promptly shut down the program, leaving me with two options: Bible Study (which would be awkward) or Youth Group (which would be like having hot pokers shoved down my throat). I've been going to the Bible Study for the last few weeks (which was good because unlike another program, they provide snacks and drinks, which is a good way to win my heart. And it worked. The only problem is that it's boring. It's crashingly boring. It's Sinclair-on-an-educational-tangent boring. And youth group is...loud. It's very loud. I worked in the library (that's where we started two years ago) and could feel the vibrations of loud Christian Rock music through the floor. And I am not a Christian Rock person by any stretch of the imagination.  So I'm staying home tonight, and I'm trying to get out of going next week, because it's really awkward and boring, so my parents have come up with a solution (which I think is a really, really bad idea)   Go to the Comstock's youth group.   I'm not kidding. That is their solution. It's not that I have a problem with the Comstocks or Marten or their church, It would be awkward for me, awkward for the Comstocks and Awkward for pretty much everyone involved, Not to mention the fact that I'm not a youth group person. I'm a leave-me-alone-and-I-promise-to-tithe-for-as-long-as-I-Live person. I don't want fellowship! I want people to leave me alone! I want to go to church on Sunday Morning, sit through service, get up go home (in a perfect world, we'd stop for Panda Express on the way home. It's finger Ling-Ling Good!) I don't want to have to constantly go to church after the new minster just ripped the rug right out from under me. And then had the gall to say that in order to work child care on Sundays you have to stay for two services, one to help and one to be "Spiritually Fed". So I'm mad at stuff, and planning on ranting at my parents in Latin if I have to go next week.   Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh?

      Goodness.  I think I might have died.  Either that or my computer did; it's been superbly slow lately and I've just taken to ignoring the fact that I hadn't read nearly anything on here in several weeks.  I'm going to try very hard to make this entry long enough to satisfy all of you critics and also to avoid the phrase "lol" to get on the good side of Michael.  Happiness.   Anyways, I finally put my answers for the 5 question-thing.  Probably not the best, but whatever.   Guess what I'm listening to!   Phantom of the Opera .  Yay!  I really really really love opera and musicals and all that jazz.  Woo, I love that movie, too.   Chicago , I mean.  That's a great movie and has a fantastic soundtrack.  I just wish I could sing like that.   And, Erin, your underwear-thing-story was fantastic.  I super-loved it because it sounds like so much fun.  I wish my family were like that.  Haha, grandma underwear.   Goodness gracious, how am I supposed to have anything worthwhile to say?  I really...uh...don't like Mr. Phillipy?  How's that?  And, Marten, your hair looked pretty today.  Hehe, nice and wavy.  Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?  (There are drugs in musicals, though.  The musical, Hair, has a lot of marijuana in it, if I remember correctly.)

      I added a new template. It's a little bit long but kind of works in an odd way. It's from Wendola's South Pacific (TV Movie) recap. Sorry for excessive posting, I just discovered this now and not at 6:54:26 PM when "You know something there, General Cho? If you had a story, you'd write it. If you don't have one, shut up." went up.  Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals.

      Props to Marten for administering a well-written and well-acted smackdown. I updated What Kind of Day Has It Been. Read "Process Stories" there.  I just saw a very good epsiode of Scrubs. Michael J. Fox guest starred as a doctor with obssessive compulsive disorder, who was unable to use any toilet but the one in his own house, however he conquered this fear and used the roof toilet. The message: We all need to poop on the roof.  That was completely random and probably won't make sense unless you either watched the show, or saw this particular episode.  I added this so Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.

      Nate, you have no right to complain about LN's Drama program, no matter how much it sucks.  You had the opportunity to switch to LC.  "You make every show by virtue of being male" I recall that thats why you stayed with it, simply because you can get a part sans actual acting ability.  No insult to yours, but you really don't improve it by such low standards, so shut your trap about how your program sucks.  Ooh, looks like you just got served.  Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.

      Huh. Fitting Title, eh,  Jonah ?  I am really tired right now. However I am happy that everyone (except Marten, who  (just did)  is busy and Sophia, who apparently  died ) participated in the inaugural Friday Five. This bodes well for the future.   Also Erin, It's taken you this long to see Finding Nemo? Wow...that's sad. By the way I have JournalCon news. It is tentatively set for the 30th of April (provided the Comstocks don't bail) and will double as Michael's birthday, so bring presents ( urlLink HINT    urlLink HINT ) Wow, there is quite a bit of html in that sentence! Woo!The plan for this JournalCon are to push through the last season of Sports Night AKA Dan Rydell's (nonsensical and badly plotted) spiral into MADNESS! But then we're going to do MovieJournalCon! Everyone Bring Two Favorite Movies, which will lend themselves well to commentary, of which we will watch some if not all! Please nothing R or starring Pauly Shore.   Also Yayness on my second new reader! Someone from the University of Maryland accessed my site! YAY!  Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.

      Um, yeah, sorry about the "ass comment." It means that you pulled it out of thin air or off the top of your head. Still, bad wording on my part.  A mystery has been solved. If any of you ever watched Renee Zelwegger receive an award and thought, "Who the hell is John Carabino?" the answer is, he's her manager. Not her personal self-esteem booster as I had previously conjectured.  I've seen Finding Nemo now. It rocks. Also, I have convinced my dad to watch Chicago. He hasn't yet, but he will.

      Props to Ryan in Chicago, the first person outside the state of Indiana to visit my site.  I liked the show. I'm not going to jump up and down on it like I did with "Once in a Lifetime", I just have a few comments. The Comstocks officially rocked the party. I have to talk about the singing (Remember I showed up at 7:00 so I missed "Agony") The entire youth group came out, half of them looked disinterested, the other half was shuffling around so much, and it made me wonder if this group had ever sang in front of people before. The Twilight Zone/Outer Limits sketch was funny. It pretty much wiped away the...wait, we're being nice...ummm...It was good! The Circle of Life was Fishcakes to the nth degree. I couldn't tell if the girl was even singing. What Line is it Anyhow was...It was bad. I'm sorry, but I was at the Comstock Birthday Party, and I know that Marten, Thomas, Nathan and Jonah are much much better than what the did here. Thomas managed to liven up his role, but Nathan's Jekyll/Hyde Newscaster was just...not very good, Jonah did okay with his role, which was a huge shoutout to Sports Night's Casey McCall. It was bad, but better than a Horatio Sanz skit on SNL. Which is indeed, a good thing. Levi and Colin were great doing "Masterpiece Theatre", my only comment is that there was a passing reference to the "New York City Capitol Building", which would be...wrong. Unless it was intended, in which case, Bully For You! The Piano playing of How Beautiful was extemely good. Massive Props to Jennifer! Which brings me to the finalé, Stomp. I am not a fan of Stomp, it's fun when it begins but after five minutes the gimmick wears off, and you're sitting in a theatre listening to forty grown men drum on trashcans for two hours. The gimmick did wear off soon after the beginning, however it was masterfully done, with no visible mistakes. I was really surprised since I thought this would immediately crash and burn, but it didn't, which is also a good thing. It was a good show, I had the same problem with it as I do with SNL, which is too many musical numbers and not enough skits. But still very, very good. Please don't hurt me.   Also I accidentially took my brothers medication, which is disconcerting me. I now realize why he is so screwed up! It's the pills! I pulled a muscle in my back today. I'm tired now and need to go to bed. Goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow!  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

      Oh, come on, Erin!  At least you have a group like that.  We have one year of Theatre overcrowded with people who don't want to be there, but need a fine arts credit to graduate, a program with no funding and a teacher who's opposed to backdrops and sets because they "distract from the actors".  You make every show by virtue of being male, and we still have to have one guy play Mercutio and Escalus.  And we can't even afford to give him two different costumes!  We're a joke.  Seriously, you have no right to complain about your drama program. The talent show went better than expected.  Which isn't all that good considering I expected it to crash and burn.  But it didn't.  Which is good. Show choir has me in a permanently comatose state.  I still refuse to yield to the coffee. Love the vest.  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

      Just got done with the CPC talent show.  It went well for a show that had never actually been run prior to performance.  Thomas, you may remove the hat of shame and replace it with your trendy new hat, but keep it handy in case it ever becomes needed again.  The hat shall become the voice of justice for the chaotic crime-ridden blog! Or something.  On to match-ups.  Last we had a super intelligent toothpick vs Alex Trebeck's hair in a world domination competition.  We never could have imagined they'd join forces to create the ultimate evil.  So the next match will be James bond, equipped only with Thomas's new hat and my new vest, vs the Axis of Evil (the toothpick and the hair)  Should be interesting.  And about this vest.  I just purchased it at Goodwill and it is, in Layman's terms, cultural syncretism. (Just my little LN joke) Seriously in layman's terms, it is simply hideous.  Orange, green, and red plaid with cylindrical wooden buttons.  It will go perfectly with my purple shirt.  BTW, Erin: Thank you for reading my story.  As a fellow writer of fiction, your opinion means much to me, the whole ass thing aside.   That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

      And if you're angry at me, well, you've got a lot of company. I'm going to explain all this. There's a website called "Friday Five" where they pose interesting and somewhat personal questions, and it would serve as a good way for all of you to know me better. Also feel free to edit your answers into the post. Or don't. I really don't care that much. But without further ado, The Inaugural Friday Five.   What was...   1. ...your first grade teacher's name?  Michael: Mrs. Vittori. She liked bunnies. Jonah: I can't remember her name, but I can see her face.  She taught at Hancock Elementary in Minnesota.  The school's idea of an accelerated program was to pull Caitlin Ngam and I out of class every other hour so we wouldn't be learning stuff we already knew. Nathan:  Mrs. Fox.  Thinking back, I don't think she enjoyed having me in her class all that much.  I was too smart for her. Thomas: Ms. King. Great teacher, taught me how to handle me math. Erin: Mrs. Bainter, my second grade teacher. She maintained that I was the best writer she'd ever taught. Marten:Mrs. Haase.  She loved me, and probably contributed to my giant ego Sophia:  I have no idea...can't remember that far ago!  I remember it was my last year at Crooked Creek Elementary School, though.  2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?  Michael: Pokémon, when I was in 5th grade, but now I enjoy sleep. Oh! Sonic the Hedgehog! That's it! Jonah:  I don't watch them so much, but I have to say Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Nathan: Captain Planet, all the way!   Thomas: Batman!!!!! That was my first word. Teenage Mustant Ninja turtles gets and extremely close second. Erin: Alvin and the Chipmunks! The hyped-up '80's version. I liked the episodes with the girls in them. Brittany the Chipette was my idol. Marten: I miss anamaniacs and freakazoid Sophia:  I was a super-fan of Recess.  3. ...the name of your very first best friend?  Michael: Eric Oxyang in Yorba Linda. Jonah: Nathan.  'Nough said. Nathan: Jonah.  Ditto. Thomas Fowler: Andrew Clarke (From my old-school Chicago days) Erin: Probably Jessica Diefenbach, because our parents were friends, but I don't remember much of that. Marten: Louis. introduced me to randomness at age six Sophia:  Kelly Roeder...best friend since 2nd grade.  Yay.  4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?  Michael: Lucky Charms. Marshmallows all the way! Jonah: I love Quaker Oat Squares.  Also Waffle Crisp. Nathan: Raisin Bran is a classic Thomas: Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best cereal ever. Erin: Honey Nut Cheerios. With strawberries in. Marten: Reeses! Sophia:  mmm...frosted mini wheats with strawberries.  Yummy.  5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?  Michael: Putter around the internet. Or occiasionally play PS2 and watch The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Jonah:  Eat, check webcomics, update blogs. Nathan: By the time I get home, sleep.  Thomas: Watch tv, and game like the shrubnip I am. Erin: Either get online or watch snippets of my DVDs. I can only do these things if my brother's not home, though, because he gets online before me and makes fun of my DVDs. Marten:videogames or sleep Sophia:  SLEEP!  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

      Yay, Thomas posted! I'm so proud!  Well, I am all caught up reading a little piece of narrative genius entitled "The New Toaster" and have duly commented. Everyone cheer, do the hokey pokey, and turn yourselves around. I have been asked to actually follow up on my earlier comment, "LC Players sucks." This is why it sucks. We have no money and we get no time to do anything. Horrigan never gives us enough time to rehearse stuff. We have a performance on Tuesday, and what did we spend last Monday doing? Playing random waste-of-time improv games! And then she has the nerve to criticize how I blocked the play after having me block about half of it in one class period. Grrr. But it's all cool, because I got to be in the senior Lyceum picture! :) Important news! The fanfiction.net search is working again, so everybody go there and type in The Shifty Troublemaker. Remember, that SW humor parody script with drug-induced penguins I keep talking about? If you haven't read it yet, read it. If you have, then review it so that it may get updated and finished! It's funny, I promise!  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

      Had the Ball State choir competition today. Ben McGill and I are in backup for Sweet Sensation, the LC women's show choir. The choir unexpectedly got second placed, beating out LN's Hip Street, which usuallly dominates. We also unexpectedly got best back up band, along with Central Sound's band getting best backup band. This means an LC backup band sweep. Huzzah!! Nathan's Concert Choir was screwed out of victory. How did the judges not choose a choir that sings a part in French? On to my rockin' new hat. It is a nifty hat that is used for the German reenacting unit that Marten and I do. It is blue and yellow and looks like those hats that people used to wear with pajamas. If you have further interest, search for fatigue cap on your internet browser. Yay Thomas posted. Does this mean hat of shame revocation?  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

It's all about Jonah. Like on ER how it's all about Abby, or how The West Wing is all about Josh and Toby this year.  Of course, I am being sarcastic...  Also Jonah, It was very very funny. I laughed like this, "HA HA HA HA HA Change it back.". (Retribution for Monday is below)  Read Marten's disturbing leg hair/puberty entry of at The Taj Malobby!

      Tyler Rudd, Yay or Nay? (Let's putting all this crap in one post so that we can delete it without much fuss if he joins. Just edit it in, like with the Friday Five.)   Erin:  Yeah, sure, why  not.  Jonah: Fear the Orange, Mortals.  And fear the orange mortals.  [After many intense hours translating this with those people who translate at the United Nations, we are ready to declare this a yea.  --Michael]   Marten: Yay!  Michael:  Yay. I'm for the bringing of Tyler if for no other reason than the fact that it will make Nathan shut the hell up about hiring people. Although the blog has been more frequently updated with Paul and Rachel and the new (and Frequent!) postings of Thomas.  Nathan:  Yay.  Paul:   Rachel:   Sophia:  Yeah!  Another person who will cover up the fact that I'm too lazy to post!  Thomas:  This is the way we wash our pants!  Laurence Fishburne:  Yay.  Mr. T:  I pity the foo who won't let Tyler join.  Donald Trump:  He's Fired. The Friday Five will be up again, they just haven't updated for a while on the homepage.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      Erin, what I meant was I thought it would be weird for you.  I have no problem with it.  But I've found that for the most part my friends who have graduated don't want to hang out with sophomores and juniors as much.  Sorry if I offended you.   I know you said no more people, but I'd really like to invite Tyler to join.  He's going to being going to Indiana Academy next year and we won't see much of him.  Plus Pyler is incomplete without Taul.  He probably wouldn't post much anyway.  Just to consider.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      Or "Things I'm Irrationally Pissed At, Part Two"   The return of the Killjoy : She's  taking a late lunch break today, so right now she's standing behind the desk chatting with the other librarian, the one who denied me  urlLink the SRT pass . There are actually a few people sitting in the back, despite the fact that a class is coming in here soon.   Mr. Hall : What can you say about Hall. He's annoying, loud, gay, has the most annoying accent of all time, narrowly beating out Melissa George's OmniAccent on Alias. The only non-assy thing he's done all year is not shoot down my Persuasive Speech Proposal. I'll be posting that as a separate piece (heh.) on What Kind of Day Has It Been, after I give it May 18th. I don't want Hall to google it and think that I stole it.    Career Day : It sucked. Sophia, Rachel, Thomas, Marten and I stand together in solidarity on this one. Ya-Ya! Thomas, who by far had the worst experience will write about his thing once he gets back from Chicago and he'll cover Government and Social Services in that post, (we had the same pick!) though I will say that it was much more  urlLink Third Watch  than  urlLink The West Wing .  Now I will talk about my second session, which was Engineering, proctored by Richard "Math Teacher With A Big Old Stick Up His Butt" Britton. The engineer was boring, and cussed a lot for a career day presentation (Hell twice, Dumbass once), and pissed the Architect off more than a little when he name dropped that the Architect worked on John Mellencamp's house. Mellencamp? Woo-fucking-Hoo. The Architect was more boring than...Something really boring. He had a picture of what quite possibly could have been the ugliest building ever designed and showed us a design for the house of arich realtor who could not be named (There was a monogrammed TC or possibly CT on there, if you actually care to find out.) That's what prompted the dumbass crack.   Okay I'm going to go now. JournalCon is set for 5:30 PM, May 7th, which is my birthday so any presents that you would bring could very well buy my eternal love and a spot in the Penthouse Suite of my Heart (Right off the Left Ventricle!).  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      Erin, no one's trying to replace you.  Nate was just curious, though a bit stupid.  How exactly would that be weird?  Meanwhile, I've been considering tossing my current schedule out the window and graduating early.  Even though I wouldn't, because I couldn't survive and still be Marten.  I'd probably come out as, I dunno, martin or something.  Paul: somewhere around here are rules about title schemes, which you have suddenly followed by accident after stopping the book one, (Which is Erin's) and you have to keep the template in your post.  After the current one has been in use for a week, you can change it. look in the archives for rules I'm forgetting.  Meanwhile, the post ratio has gone a bit off for our most elusive members. Thomas has posted twice within a week, but where's Sophia?   Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      Am now reading Bridget Jones's Diary and am having trouble reinserting pronouns, etc. into vocabulary.   Welcome to Paul!  Well, it seems since one was last online and not too busy to blog, great irrelevent things have happend, much political murmuring has taken place, a new blogger has unknowingly tried to steal one's title scheme without any rebuke, and it has been suggested that after graduation one ought to just go away and not speak to any of you ever again. One feels miffed.  I think that all of you should know that Frieje is just doing the hall sweep thing because when Dr. Hodgin was visiting he saw four fights in the hall, which is just sad. And Frieje is not any kind of asshole, just rather misguided. He is far superior to Hanna because he at least knows and cares about what's going on. I won't argue that the hall sweeps are dumb, but they probably wont last. And even if they do, well-- I won't be there. Aha! Ahahahahahaha!  Michael didn't know about my Arthurian obsession and came under the impression that I have a girl crush on Keira Knightley. Oh, dear. Really, I was just looking at the costume and metalwork; I'd have been staring at Clive Owen or anyone else just as hard. I have decided that the new King Arthur movie should really be called, "Bend It Like Boudicca." And this, in fact, is how into the dark ages Britain/ Arthurian thing I am. Boudicca was a real, historical Celtic warrior queen. When the Romans invaded, I think about 400 years or so before Arthur time, Boudicca's daughters (and maybe her, I forget) were raped by Roman soldiers and she vowed revenge. She actually mounted an offensive that came the closest of any British attempt at driving the Romans out of Britain-- she was certainly the only one who gave them a real run for their money-- and she actually fought with the soldiers and everything. If I remember correctly, she drove them all the way down to the southern portion of the island... But that's just digression. What I'm wondering now is things like, will they use some copy of the Sutton Hoo helmet somewhere, as it's so popular with dark ages things; what does the guy who plays Lancelot look like, his name is very Welsh-- Gruffydd, or something; is the Merlin they're using old Merlin or young Mary Stewart-type Merlin; are they putting in any of the other cool female figures, e.g. Morgan and Nimue. I'll stop now.  They have not taken away Senior Skip-a-Final, you uninformed ninnies!  Irrelevant spoiler of the day: Correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think I posted a teaser last time. So today's spoiler is-- In Ep. III, Obi-Wan wields... a lightsaber. It is the traditional weapon of the Jedi Knight-- not as clumsy or random as a blaster, an elegant weapon. It's a sword made of light, a laser sword! (hehe, "laser sword")  Must do homework now.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      Hall sweeps are a new policy at LC. Upon the ringing of the bell, the teacher's will close and lock their doors, and those people who are not in class, will be metaphorically swept into the Auditorium, where they will be yelled and bitched at about the importance of being punctual.  JournalCon is in one week, at my house. Erin, Rachel and Sophia are invited, but due to prudish parents, cannot participate in the sleepover. Food will be provided, however any donations would be appreciated.  Also, Paul: Respect the template. Keep it in your posts. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      The World History AP test is really scaring me.  The test is on Wednesday, we still have 85 years of history and two world wars to cover, not to mention all the stuff we skipped along the way, yet Leonhart thought it a good idea to spend the period watching a video on and having a discussion of African colonialism.  In short, he's doing nothing to advance the curriculum for those of us taking the test.  Part of the problem, of course, is that the test comes way to early in the year, but still, we need to be cramming, not just continueing as if we had all year. Can someone explain to me exactly what these "Hall Sweeps" are?  I've heard nothing about them at LN.  Yesterday in class Leonhart was talking about African colonialism, and he compared the French colonial government to the SAC, saying that there was a ruling council of Africans, but they had no power.  It's worth noting, though, that Ms. Lupold consulted them on the changes they were planning to the Skip-a-final policy.  I don't know if she'll take any of the advice she gave, but still, they were consulted on something important. Is Erin gonna keep blogging here from Hanover?  I'm just curios, it seems like it would be kind of strange.   Vote on the Democrats, or you will have elected either Daniel or Duck man by default.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      I used Ms. Means in this one because she said it.  She was talking about the musical and how if we didn't do such-and-such everyone would leave.  Anyway, I just want to say that I am oblivious to Hall Sweeps because I have a press pass!  I am awesome!  I do like the protest idea, but I think instead of doing it I'll put on my press pass and interview people about it.  Protestors always like to be in the paper. Anyway, I need to go to bed so I will make a real update later.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      I have several not very important things to adress.  First, I am changing my title scheme to the flavor text from my magic cards.  Second, I feel for Michael and the other LC people and would be willing to coordinate an LN "sit down" protest at the exact same time.  And thirdly, for those of you who don't know Tyler Rudd, we have reconfigured ourselves into Pyler and Taul.  That is all.

      I now hate Frieji.  From now on I am intentionally misspelling his name.  I am now making a list of things he obviously doesn't know: 1. We're a highschool, not a middleschool, jail, concentration camp, or the like. 2. Students will often be late for valid reasons and proper passes, while distributed, haven't done much. 3. The Principal isn't supposed to do anything! Hasn't he heard of Mrs. Hannah? I think the man's definately over-compensating 4. Getting swept is just going to make the student later. It's not going to speed anything up 5. It leads to stupid people doing stupid things in protest, when they're the ones who actually deserve it and aren't going to help any with their lame attempts at "fighting the power."  Okay, redundant rant complete, on to business.  Thomas, that conversation is reminiscent of the monkey story.  How come I'm never around for those? I smell chicken! c'mon, some one keep going... darn it.   nothing ever happens around here   Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      All you Fall Creekrians weren't at Belzer for the time of the hallsweeps. They were just damn irritating and didn't actually improve anything. For me, the hallsweeps not only seem to be wreaking of the Gestapo, but also seem like we are reverting back to middle school tactics. I am in full support of Michael's proposed "sit down" protest. In the meantime, don't get swept. -Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      I don't know, as much as I am hating Freije, the hall sweeps reek of Burden and Brouwer. And maybe the Dean who's name eludes me right now. And I think I've seen the signs, like Tuck the Feachers and Hallsweeps Promote Drugs, which is built on extremely shaky logic.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      Michael I totally agree with you about our newly turned communist school.  It's lunatic!

      Or "Things I'm Irrationally Pissed At, Part One: School"   SAC Elections : What is the point of SAC elections? They drag me from SRT, put me in the auditorium and have me vote. The voting however is moot, because in every category (except Student Body President) there is only one person running. It was Pre-War Iraq! One person (I won't mention names) I didn't vote for (even though he was the only person running) because he looked like he was hit in the face with the concave side of a shovel. I voted for one person because her name was funny (and because her opponent who promised candy, didn't deliver) and I voted for Spud, because he's cool. And this in reality is not an election, it's a popularity contest. Any given Sophmore's interest in the electoral process is minimal, if present at all. And it's not like the SAC does anything terribly difficult. They don't have to decide to bomb North Central in a pre-emptive strike, they help with charity, sell pizza and plan dances. I care about one of those three things. ONE. I'm not likely to care who student body vice-treasurer is.   Hall Sweeps : Hall Sweeps are evil and Frejie is a tiny impotent Nazi with a bug up his butt the size of an emu. And the multiple SRT bells are mondo annoying if you're trying to nap during SRT. I think someone should organize a school sit-down where every person leaves their class, and five minutes into the passing period, sits down wherever in the school they happen to be. What are they going to do, write everyone up? This leads into my next topic...   Idiotic Bitchy Administrators : It's amazing how they can't put two and two together and figure out that by eliminating perks (McTravel, Senior Skip-A-Final) school spirit goes down. Huh, it's amazing how that works, eh? and regarding CD Players: I want to listen to my iPod during frigging SRT! I'm at the point where I'm ready to hand out bribes to the staff, just so I can hear some Massive Attack during passing periods!  I'm irrationally pissed as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

The Squid3188: which can under the right circumstances grow toes onto people Tofig36: But isn't that designed to detect frogs? The Squid3188: well yes, but that's why they discontinued it The Squid3188: if you hook it up to a toaster and shoot it full of gamma rays it does the darndest things Tofig36: interesting, I never would have guessed Tofig36: How did Shibs get his grubby hands on one? The Squid3188: how do you think? Tofig36: Oh... it's like that then. The Squid3188: yep The Squid3188: fish sticks and everything The Squid3188: right in the middle of Wal-mart Tofig36: That poor guard and with all those fishsticks The Squid3188: indeed The Squid3188: but the point is he has one, and he owes me a favor Tofig36: excellent!

Tofig36: true, but the polyfumerate will make  the deflemulagtor nearly indestructable The Squid3188: isn't that a good thing? Tofig36: yes so that is why we are using polyfumerates of polycarbonates The Squid3188: oh, right The Squid3188: suppose reinforced the polyfumerates with ubnium, just in case Tofig36: Excellent idea!

I won't *cough* Erin *cough* mention any names, but it's too bad that there's still such evil in this world.  I don't remember what else I was going to- THOMAS! I HAVE TO GO!

      At last, after significant delays which I will mention later, I am in the blog.  You may refer to me as the all knowing and all powerful walnut, speaking through my mind slave Paul.  Paul would like to note that his computer was most likely designed to to torment his imortal soul.  He relishes the idea of climbing on his roof and throwing his computer in the air and shooting it with a shotgun or other projectile weapon.  But, if he did that he would have no computer, plus climbing on top of his house with a computer over his back is too strenuous for Paul.  Anyway, I am glad to be in the blog to rant about my plans for world domination and Paul's titanic struggle with his neighbor's cat.

      Hurray for Patrick Shaughnessy!  Okay, explaination of random post. I was really bored, past the point of Prozac the Bear crazy. Everything after the greenday song are excerpts from song lyrics I wrote for "Searching for Sammy" which may or may not end up an actual band. nifty is it not? I sleep now.  Toasters don't play tunes, they cook bread

      Okay, I've got stuff to tell you! The Sky is Blue! Playgrounds are Fun! Grandpa is Old!  Seriously, Nathan is more like his  urlLink brother  than he'd like to think. See "Yaargh!"  Nathan: I'll put you down for St. John's (Newfoundland?), but I've got to say A.) You are more in need of a night in Atlantic City than any man I've met and B.) You missed perfect opportunity to use "Dark was the Night, Cold was the Ground" as a title.  Marten: The random post was strange, but by "FIN!" you had me. Nothing gets me more than mock-art-film endings.  Erin: I'm putting you down for a seat in Taxxgrrl's car to the Lafayette TWoPCON.  Jonah: Your new title scheme is good, but you're going to run out of people and I'm going to laugh.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      I haven't done much over at What Kind of Day Has It Been. I've got some prewritten entries that I don't want to type because I'm lazy. However I am doing Celebrated Weekend articles for a few weeks. What is Celebrated Weekend? I'm glad you asked: American Airlines' inflight magazine runs a regular feature where a celebrity will talk about their favorite city and what they like to do there, where they like to eat and stay. For example, "Martin Sheen's Las Vegas" or "Kiefer Sutherland's Toronto" I thought, "Why don't I do something like that." So I'm doing them about the Compendium gang!   So far I have "Thomas Fowler's Chicago", "Sophia Jacobs' Ireland", "Michael Christie's Los Angeles", "Marten Dollenger's Kalamazoo" and "Erin Chandler's Orlando".  [You can add Nathan Comstock's St. John's]   I'll do these again around this time next year. Hopefully we all can go to many great places between now and then! The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      For Easter I got the Pirates of the Caribbean DVD. Keira Knightley cracks me up. She does commentary the way I do commentary. Randomly.  In the past few days I have learned a great deal from visiting the Royal Handmaiden Society website. I'm sure I've shared many of them with you. Like that Ani can't count, and Yané is silly, and Hayden tripped over a nightgown and Artoo fell over a lot. They also have a music video which is really pretty and is scored with an instrumental song, but if you play it while listening to "Into the West," it fits with that amazingly well.  I'm in a good mood because of Keira and because Dex's Diner just got reviewed by Kazzy, a fanfic author I greatly admire and whom I review all the time. She must've been like, "Who the hell IS this?" and read my profile and checked out Dex. And the review was favorable, and the gods have smiled upon me. Yay!  I vote for the Duck Man! He's a very intelligent guy, really. He would be great at the job. "Mr. President, what are you going to do about the war?" "What war?" "The taxes?" "What taxes?" Actually, he probably would realize and acknowledge the existence of those things. And give money to beggars, help with unemployment, etc. But imagine the press conferences. "Mr. President, about this duck on your head..." "What duck?" "Can we quote you on that?"  If the term "secretary" is outdated, why isn't Colin Powell referred to as Administrative Professional of State?  Irrelevant Spoiler of the Day: Wait, I have to look up what I said it was going to be... blah blah blah... oh, yes. Do any Jedi survive the dreaded "Jedi Purge," or, as Thomas would have it, Jedi Porridge? Yes. Obi-Wan survives; I'll give you three guesses as to where he ends up. Hint: It's hot and sandy and IN EVERY FORCEDAMN MOVIE. Master Yoda also survives and gets as far away from aforementioned planet and the spawn of Anakin as possible. A wise one, that Yoda.

      If you couldn't understand the last one take heart, for I have a new title scheme: Prospective autobiography titles!  I'm thinking mostly for me, but some might be for you guys or other people entirely! Anyway, the Pajama Game is now over.  Thanks to all of you who came, came to half of it, would have come if you'd known the right time and hadn't had choir, or were out of town but expressed a desire to come.  I appreciate it.   So, I've decided to do Marching band.  Or not.  I'm still not sure.  The marching band people make these great, logical arguments when I'm with them, and then the non-marchers make sense when I'm with them.  So anyone who cares if I'm in Marching Band or not (Marten, Thomas) send me an e-mail outlining the pros and/or cons.  That might help.  If I am doing and want to be captian I have to write an essay by the end of the week. I am really not keeping up on these match-ups!  But today I'm setting up a big match involving a walrus, a walleye, a wallet, a walnut, a wall, Walt Disney, and Wally from DIlbert.  The will battle it out at Wal-Mart.  They may only use weapons purchased at Wal-Mart and have ten dollars to spend.  I'm giving all inatimate object telekinesis with a three foot range that can't be used on people directly. MArten - most of us respond to stuff in our own posts, rather than sticking things in each other's.  In the words of some girl on the interdisc boards, "i feel violated... like raped or something not nice" Here's some context:   mrs.harrypotter: I dont believe i need an introduction... im well fairly famous    [medit] Actually, this is Kelly Marchant. Just letting you guys know. [/medit]  hey now how did you guys do that i feel violated... like raped or something not nice   Something to think about.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      Ha, kinda like the store, only not.  Sorry.  Umm...so, thanks for the happiness, all.  It's appreciated, surely, and...that's about it!  Oh!  Yeah!  MY vote!  Daniel Day all the way!  MAKE WAY FOR DAY!  :D  Daniel will kick all of their butts to China-town because he could argue all day about the meaning of life in Greek (or maybe it's Arabic now?), French, and probably his made-up language.  He'd confuse Al Sharpton so much he'd end up being condemned to hell, but that's a-okay, because Day does't believe in all that!  At least I don't think he does...oh well.  He's a nice guy, anyway, and the only one of the four I've ever met.  Plus, Kelly's dating him, so that means a lot.  :D :D :D   The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      I'm happy for both of you.  Really.  Just try and keep the affectionate name calling and banter down on the blog.  And Thomas, I want you to tell me about any PDA's so I can make fun of them.  But no detail, please.  Also, I have a CD I need a copy made of.  I'll get it to you ASAP.  The Republican candidate was decided in a game of Soul Caliber because we couldn't find Mortal Combal and it's better anyway.  Of course, the Skeleton and Palpatine each tried to mind control each other until they were both trying to let the other one win, making it a competition to see who could lose best, with the loser winning.  The Skeleton was losing (winning) when he suddenly said "I sleep now" restoring Palpatine's control of his own mind for long enough to beat the crap out of the skeleton's character.  So Palpatine wins.  Opposing him for the Democrats will be:  The Duck man (from Discworld) Daniel Day (the one who used to go to middle school with most of us, not to be confused with Daniel Day Lewis, the actor) Lawrence Fishburne The Reverand Al Sharpton  Make your vote count!

      I've heard this conversation many, many times, several in a classroom and most of them in front of a teacher. Story Courtesy of Jonah.  [Why didn't Jonah post it?-Marten]   The Squid3188:  I'm going to copy and paste a story I just told Marten cause it's funny The Squid3188: I heard these two black guys talking in the bathroom today The Squid3188: and the first one was taking allergy pills The Squid3188: the second was said"man, whatcha takin' those for?" The Squid3188: and he was like, "Allergies, man" The Squid3188: "Well, what you allergic too?" The Squid3188: "Grass and Weeds" The Squid3188: "Man, how you gonna be allergic to weed?" The Squid3188: "Not marijuana, man.  Dandelions and shit" The Squid3188: "Oh.  I feel you, man.  I feel you"  Okay, even though this thought completely warrants a new post, I'm going to splice it in here. I saw something that almost sent me in a seizure right in the middle of the commons. Something so terrifying and evil that I almost screamed when I saw it.   Mrs. Howard was at LC.  I don't know why.  [incoming freshmen-Marten] I don't know how. [she can drive-Marten]  All I know is that she was there, and she scared the hell out of me. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      If you are not already watching Alias and/or 24, you totally need to start. They have both after mediocre seasons, risen up and come back, with great directing (Ken Olin should totally win an Emmy for "Hourglass". Of course, it'll go to Christopher Misiano, but still. He should win it.) to great acting (Victor Garber who has come a long way from  Godspell  and Ron Rifkin, who may have sown up his own supporting actor in a drama nomination.  I know I'm just pimping my shows here, but seriously? They're awesome.  Alias: Sundays @ 9 on ABC; 24: Tuesdays @ 9 on FOX.  Also, Thomas thinks you should watch Scrubs. In fact you will watch Scrubs! Because who's the boss of you? Thomas is the boss of you.  Scrubs is Thursday @ 9:30 on NBC. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      Okay, if anyone doesn't remember Sophia's first post, It said something along the lines of being my super hot, way-cool friend who just happens to be a girl.  Then I complained, and stuff was said about lesbians in Arkansas, but thats not the point. The point is that now she  is  my super hot way-cool girlfriend, unless the fact that everyone and there mother knows creeps her out so much that she'll not dump me, but viciously throw me down like an annoying chipmunk sitting on her shoulder and biting her ear.  I really,  really  hope she doesn't do that.  I may be kinda weird, but after a while it makes perfect sense, to me atleast.  I've been dealing with some akwardness too, but you know, you're worth a bit of confusion.   The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      Sophia, you do not get the hat of shame. The hat of shame is for people who screw up. Thomas is wearing the Hat of Shame until his grade in math is better. You are sentenced to wear the (brand new!) Hat of Ill-Repute, forever and ever until the end of your days.  JournalCon date is (until someone tells me otherwise) May 7th-8th. We're doing Season Two of Sports Night in all it's horrible Dating Plan glory.  I'm working on a review of The Pajama Game, It'll be at What Kind of Day Has It Been tomorrow, unless I get lazy and maybe it won't ever get anywhere.  All I have to say is, Sophia, you missed a hell of a show.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      This is just a short entry to say that the Pajama Game last night was awesome! Everything we were promised and more. Tiffany Webb is amazing, Jonah made for an excellent disgruntled employee and Nathan an excellent chorus member, and the orchestra too was pretty darn good. So hooray! Everybody get hyped!  Michael: Tact 101-- Tact does not mean lying, it means telling the truth gently. And, all jokes about you being dead inside aside, you're going to have to learn to use it because people tend not to like having their feelings hurt, and if you hurt their feelings you will sooner or later find yourself very much without friends.

      Disclaimer: Erin does not condone any women ever being struck like gongs.  Welcome to the blog, Rachel!  What I Did On My Field Trip I went to see a play called Private Lives it was funny. It had lots of witty banter that was very well done, it made me laugh. We went to the mall. We ate at the mall I also bought some books. They were The Truth and Night Watch, now there are only five Discworld books I dont own not counting the young adult ones and Last Hero. We got back at 2:30 and sat in the commons until the bell rang. This was a happy day. The End.  I am coming to Pajama Game tonight because tomorrow I am booked to go see Ella Enchanted with my aunt and my cousin and Toni. I can buy my own tickets, it's ok.   Dr. Disco was... bizarre.  [Girl, you stole my adjective! --Michael]  Somehow I think we pulled it off, but only just barely. If I ever hear Horrigan say "Oh my gosh" again I'm going to slap her. Amendment to the disclaimer: She is the only woman who should be struck regularly like a gong.  [Word. --Michael]   Oh! Palpatine! I vote Palpatine! Why? Because Palpy as president will bring corruption back to the Republic! He will put an end to democracy! The Trade Federation will free its influence over the bureaucrats and our people will be lost! He's the Phantom Menace! What could possibly be better than that? As Jonah pointed out, he would eventually just be destroyed by the Rebellion. In the meantime, we can call him "Palpy." Who needs Jedi, anyway?  Irrelevent spoiler of the day: Where have all the Jedi gone, long time passing? Where have all the Jedi gone long time ago? Where have all the Jedi gone? Gone to graveyards, every one. When will they ever learn? When will the ever learn? That's right, it's horrible, but in beginning around Episode three there is what we call a "Jedi Purge." Palpatine (he's the Phantom Menace, remember?) decides that he doesn't like the Jedi and hires people to kill them all. I weep. Next time: Do any Jedi survive this "Purge?"  Fanfiction Rec of the Week ("You might not care, but I do"): Wizzardly Accusations, a Discworld fic on ff.net in which Rincewind is accused of attempting to murder the Patrician and runs away a lot. He even throws a scent bomb at poor Angua! It's tough to be a werewolf.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!

      Rachel's in Iowa. Thomas is at Ben's house. Jonah and Nathan are doing something involving Pajamas. Marten is doing something, but not something that I can put my finger on, or see or smell or touch. Erin's doing that bizarre disco play. I don't know where Sophia is. I'm so very lonely...  Jonah: Bring my pants (and  all  of the change in my pockets) in a big bag to The Pajama Game. Otherwise they'll be lost in Jonah's room, among college brochures and clothes forever. And I liked those pants too!  Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

       one gets my scheme anyway it doesn't really matter.   We can buy you the tickets for Sunday on Saturday, but have the money with you and pay us back after the show if at all possible.  There is Youth Group, so I guess that's a plan. Marten and Michael, please get your pants out of my house at your earliest convenience. And check out Other SIde of the Corndog even if you just did, because there is a special bonus update.   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

      Okay, so here's the deal.  Since I'm dumb and can't think of what my title scheme should be, I'm just going to put random words up there until I can think of one.  Or maybe my scheme should be "random words."  I dunno yet.  I'll decide later.   I'm really sorry that I can't go with you guys to see "Pajama Game."  I'm really very upset about that, but I'll be in Iowa for a poopy soccer tournament....Comstock boys - do great! Today in choir our student teacher said that we sounded like chickens when we sang which got me to thinking (which isn't necessarily a good thing)....what if my choir and I happened to go to a farm or someplace with a lot of chickens and then started singing and the chickens were attracted to us!!!

      Okay, Jonah get tickets for Erin (unless Levi's comping her, if so we still want to sit by her), Marten, Sophia, Thomas, and I for Sunday. No I didn't go back and in a fit of OCD alphabetize those names. Stop looking at me like that. Rachel's not coming, 'cause she'll be in Iowa, which is sad. Can you get the tickets to Thomas or I (we're the closest, so that would make the most sense) before Sunday? I can pay you afterwards if you front the cash for me. Also is there a youth group that day and if so, why don't we all just go together from the show? It'd make sense. I'm all about sense and the making of it today.

I'm the one on the blog who always gets yelled at for not posting enough or for posting really stupid entries or for saying "lol" a lot.  So, welcome again!  hehe.    I have no idea about any of those crazy people for president.  I'm stupid, remember?  But, seriously, anyone is better than Bush.  Based on names, the Skeleton gets my vote.  :D.  Anyway, I swear I had something better to say!  OH!  PAJAMA GAME!  I can come Sunday night...going to a movie Saturday night and another play Friday night...so Sunday night's the only time I can come, but I WANNA SEE IT WITH YOU ALL!  So Sunday is the only way, got it?!  Okay, now I'm done.  Bye!   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...[hehehehehehehehe]

      We should post the rules on a seperate page and link to them.  Then we should add some crazy, random rules like  Rule Number six. There is absolutely NO.... Rule Number Six. (Props to Monty Python)  Anyway, welcome Rachel.  I'm posting this from the North Star room, cause I have nothing else to do.  I'm eating mysterious popcorn.  For the primary, although I'm offended that you never guess on my match-ups and comment on this the first time, I'm going with the Palpatine.  I'll go by their plans for Iraq.  Bush:   We've seen his rebuilding.  It's boring and it's going too slowly.  Bill Gates:   He'll probably institute a governement full of glitches so he can release Iraqi government 2.0 to fix the bugs, but it'll contain new ones, and pretty soon we'll just have to shut down Iraq and reboot.  The Skeleton:   He'll make all the Iraqis dance for his amusement.  This would be fun, but would probably just lead to a massive uprising the minute he says "I sleep now"  Palpatine:   He'll likely enslave the populace and force them to build a weapon that he'll use to enslave all the other countries, and pretty soon America would expand and become the Earth Empire, containing every country.  So we can see that Palpatine is best because he will bring world peace.  We'll all be united under one government.  Of course, it'll be a government of evil, but sooner or later we'll be saved by Luke and things will all be ok.  So, If you want good seats to the Pajama Game, I need a number of people and a day by tomorrow.  Money would be nice, too, but I can cover you guys until I see you.  That is all.  I sleep now   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

      First of all, official greetings from unofficial mod. Welcome to the Blog Rachel, you need a title scheme.  All mine are quotes from web comics and other blogs, Erins are quotes from books and movies, Nathan has something musical, I dont remember what, Michael's are quotes from the west wing, thomas is welcome to fred, Sophia has band name ideas, and I can't figure out Jonahs.  You need one that isn't any of those. Other rules: Nothing can be deleted, but you can add edits in bold to other posts. You can change the template(little quote thing on the bottom) only after the one currently in use has been there for a week, unless its a special occasion.  there are probably some minor rules I'm forgetting, but.... oh well.   I could have sworn I edited in that we were going saturday after thomas posted we were going friday...   ( I edited in Sunday because all the marching stuff is on Saturday and I can't go, so I was encouraging everyone to come Sunday --Thomas)   Im stuck between Palpatine and the skeleton. They should fight in Mortal Kombat. literaly.  That is, play against eachother in the video game.  Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

      Yay for Rachel who nailed her post on the first time!   Okay, I thought I would be offended when I read about the CoS Primary (even though the current president is an incumbent with an intention to run for re-election, so unless a challenger arises, there is no official "Republican Primary") but I really wasn't.  My opinions (and handy odds!) are thus:  George W. Bush : Please, Lord, not again. The man led us through September 11th. He did good. He led us into a war in Afghanistan, which didn't lead to serious problems. THE MAN NEEDS A FOUR-YEAR VACATION! After two wars (one that's a losing battle at this point ) he really needs to Get Out. Now. But I like his cabinet. Condolezza Rice kicks ass! Seriously, a viable female candidate if she desires to run. Might give Hillary a run for her money.  Odds 5:1    Bill Gates : Seriously? Can you imagine Bill Gates saying to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "Commence bombing on select military sites." That's just all kinds of wrong. The man can't design a good operating system, why would he be good as president?  Odds 50:1    Senator Palpatine : He's the model of a modern Republican. I regret to have said that as now Jonah will begin singing Pirates of Penzance now. But seriously, he is. He's got the geek vote And geeks a group that was essential in Bush's first election bid. Look for him to win a few primaries but peter out around Super Tuesday.  Odds 3:1    The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra : Perfect. Loud, Sarcastic, A little bit bitchy and concise. He's the ideal Republican candidate.  Odds 2:1   By the way, if a box of hair ran against John Kerry in the next primary, it would probably be more in tune with issues, speak more eloquently, and govern the country in a way that's fair to all, even more so than Kerry. But seriously, if you think America needs a president who can snowboard? Then vote for Kerry.  What else was I going to say? I don't know, that's your problem, I sleep now.

Actually, that's a bad idea because then I would be posting about 50 times a day...Anyway! For my very first entry (woo hoo!) I'll just talk about my other day at practice.  Okay, here's what happened...My team and I were running laps and we happened to come upon some ducks.  My friend Megan decided that she wanted to catch a duck, so she ran to go get one.  Well obviously the ducks flew away!  Which got me to thinking...why don't ducks live in trees?  I mean, they can fly so it's apparent that they can live in a tree or at least stand on a tree limb if they wanted to, but I've never ever seen a duck in a tree!  And now I want to!  My goal in life is to see a duck in a tree!   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips......that's a good question!  I think it would be a great idea to walk up to some random person, introduce myself, and touch their lips.  That way I can give and take germs and become sick and die faster than normal!  That's the best idea I've ever heard!...Or perhaps it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard...

      I realized something to day.  I can no longer remember which of my friends went to Fall Creek with me and which ones I met in High School.  The fact that I remember middle school so vaguely is worrying to me.  I think I may be going senile early.  I've decided that I need a feature, like fanfic recommendations or match-ups.  So to celebrate election year, I'm having our vary own Compendium of Stupidity election simulator.  Since we have so few people, I'm letting everyone vote in both primaries.  First the Republican primary.  The candidates are:   George W. Bush Bill Gates Senator Palpatine The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra!  Cast your votes in your next post.  Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

      Fine, we'll go Sunday. There's not a chance in hell I'm playing musical chairs though. Thomas must see The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra before it leaves Castleton Arts since he so totally wrote it. Also is it wrong that I find the fact that Marten got stood up by the Comstocks and I absolutely hilarious. By the way, Nathan made two mysterious bathroom trips.  I have SpongeBob Uno! Yay!  Why shake hands when we can shake...other things? Like Lips.

      Marten, I have yet to receive the hat of triumph, so I am ineligible for the hat of shame, that means that you get it if anyone does. I went to the IYC thing, and it was wonderful! The only low point was this guy who came on and claimed who was going to do "We Got Trouble Right Here in River City" style song and then spouted mindless dribble for around 15 minutes. No singing involved. Anywho Nathan and Alice and all the others were really good. Everyone go to Pajama Game Sunday  [I think we're going Sunday-Marten]   [No, we're going Saturday.--Michael]   No Michael, I am going Sunday then because I am busy Saturday, so Marten should come then. On Saturday, come to the World's Biggest Game of Musical Chairs, which requires 8,500 people, on Saturday and the Lawrence Park football field place. To get in free, bring your own chairs! Michael come to the musical chairs Saturday -Why shake hands when we can shake...other things?

      I havn't posted in a while, but Thomas hasn't posted in even longer, so the hat of shame lies with him.    I went to a baptist church last night! It was interesting. The man yelled. A lot.  And he didn't use his voice properly so he sounded like a louder whinier michael.  However, he had some interesting things to say, and to be fair, it was all true, but its point of view, you know? the way they interpret things, its different.  more on that on the lobby. The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra has to be the best movie. Ever. But don't see it alone, cuz it sucks when you watch it without anyone to make fun of it with.  A horrible experience I had to go through because Michael neglected to tell me of a time change.  But all is well, because Jonah paid for my ticket the second time, and I got to punch Michael in the stomach.  Why shake hands when we can touch other things?

      Jonah-- Yeah, that is an old one. And all these years I was just waiting for such an occasion as this to use it properly. I do remember Levi's hardwood floors website. That was hysterical.  Nathan-- Congratulations on the braces! :)  Yesterday was one of the coolest days ever. Mrs. Horrigan has this friend who has done plays on Broadway and everything, and he came to talk to us in SRT. His name's Ben Davis, and he went to LN. He's been in Les Mis on Broadway and a touring production of Les Mis, La Boheme on Broadway and in LA, and Thoroughly Modern Millie on Broadway. He's worked with Baz Luhrman and he's met Nicole Kidman and Leonardo DiCaprio and Hugh Jackman and James Gandolfini and James Lipton and all kinds of people. He got a Tony for La Boheme and he brought it and we all got to hold it. I got to hold an actual Tony Award! And then he sang for us. Twice. He has an amazingly beautiful voice. Plus he was really really nice. How cool is that?  Ok, I lied about having the fanfic rec up yesterday. I didn't feel like it yesterday. So it will be on Saturdays. This is all part of my grand scheme to confuse the new bloggers as much as possible when they get here. "You might not care, but I do." For this week's rec, I decided to buck tradition and go with something non-Star Wars. And I've been talking about Discworld a lot lately, so it's not that either. Instead, it is a Chicago one-shot called "Somebody Got Murdered." It's on good old ff.net. It talks about the various violent crimes committed by the six merry murderesses and the sweetest little jazz killer. It's actually very good as far as characterization and mood, even though it's a songfic, which I usually hate.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

      My braces are gone!  No more braces for Nathan!  And I can eat anything I want! In other news, the Cabaret and the Easter Egg hunt were both huge successes.  At any rate, we didn't crash and burn at the Cabaret, which is more than I can say for Josh. The Easter egg hunt had way more people than anyone expected.  We didn't hide enough eggs for everyone, but it turned out ok.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

      Erin - Wow, that takes me back.  That injoke probably predates my relationships with Marten, Thomas, and Michael (I don't actually remember when I met Sophia).  Do you remember Levi's hardwood floors website?  Anyway, I found out via Michael that there is a Moulin Rouge soundtrack II which has all the good stuff missing off the first one.  If anyone is ever looking for something to buy me that might be worth bearing in mind.  I never gave you the update on the watermelon vs a slightly larger watermelon in a pole-vulting competition.  Well, neither watermelon has arms, so the real question is, will the extra size increase the thrust of the watermelon or just add dead weight.  Of course, the larger watermelon can hold a bigger pole, which would get it higher.  So the verdict is the slightly larger watermelon.  I'll conclude with a shameless advertising plug of : The Pajama Game! Your school doesn't have a musical, so come to ours.    SEE:  A knife throwing exhibition by the amazing Vernon Hines! THe best Tropical Spanish nightclub in Cedar Rapids, Iowa! Everybody dressed for the fifties! People losing their pants to humorous effect!  HEAR:  A man singing a duet with a tape recorder! A random middle of the show number that rivals Cabin Fever! "I love you"... in morse code!  WITNESS:  The titanic struggle for Pajama Survival! You won't want to miss...  THE PAJAMA GAME  Coming soon to a Lawrence North near you! April 17 @ 7:30 and April 18 @ 2:00   It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

      Okay, that's outside my title scheme, but I had to break it just this once in celebration of the fact that our kitchen now has hardwood floors! This is very exciting for me.   Moving on, I have a new Discworld theory. I developed it while I was bored in Precal. I don't really want to disclose too much, because I think I'm going to write a story about it and I want some of y'all to be surprised. But I'm going to have to buy Night Watch. And for some reason I can't even begin to rationalize I've started to try to figure out the Discworld timeline again. Or, as I like to call it, The Glass Clock of DOOM. Especially considering that Theif of Time was mainly Pterry's big excuse for his crappy chronology and just made it worse.   Irrelevant spoiler of the Day: That's right, I know it's heartbreaking, but you remember Darth Vader? You know, the tall guy with the menacing breathing? He's Anakin. Ani falls to the dark side. Feel free to weep.  Next time: Where have all the Jedi gone? The Original Trilogy comes out on DVD in September, and the Episode III premiere is May 19, '05! Woo!   Let's see... what else did I have to say... Oh, yeah!  I'm bringing back the fanfiction recommendation of the week! And it will be every week! And it will be starting on Friday! ("You might not care, but I do.")  Sigh... sometimes I wish I had a life. And then I think... no, nevermind.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

      For those of you who haven't heard, Rachel Bossi and Paul Simmons are new members of the blog. Or will be as soon as Rachel decides to sign up and Jonah sends the invitation to Paul.   I'm blogging from school, because I'm grounded (for two days) because I didn't wash my dishes. Feh.  I'm sitting next to a girl who comes into the library everyday and sends e-mails to her uh..."significant other" consisting of nothing other then "HEY BABY! I MISS YOU! I LOVE YOU." She seriously creeps me the hell out.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar.

      I'm back too!  I finished my paper, although it sucks.  I don't particularly care, though, because it's only 60% of the 6 weeks grade.  There's still 40% of other crap.  So there.  Anyway, my cruise was AMAZING and I actually got something similar to a tan (it's still reddish).  I burn SO easily...ick.  Anyways, I'm sad I missed JournalCon and "bitchpants".  Sounds like a super-great time, though.  I answered all those questions!  Yay!  And congrats, Erin, on the new fan fiction!  It's fun stuff, and your title sounds like coolness.  Ha, I'm still in editing mode, I just changed the last sentence because the phrase "sounds coolness" wouldn't have worked.  Crazy stuff.  Anyway, bye bye!

      Yay! Comstocks have returned! Indianapolis just hasn't been the same.  Journalcon was fun. Erin, if you read this in time, please bring the tapes to youth group so they can listen to a bit of the madness. The new template fits my current mood perfectly.  This research paper is driving me mad! I'm about half-way done with it, but I have a real headache, and have taken two naps because of it.  It's like pulling teeth out of my ears.  I am generally Goshenellumpth.  Oh well. Back to work.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

      This title implies my final change to the title scheme, at least for now.  Songs.  All Songs, but mostly still musicals with some classic rock and folk music thrown in.  By the way, I officially love so called "classic rock", especially Styx, Journey, and REO Speedwagon.  More on that if I feel like it.  I'm gonna be posting more now.  Things have calmed down a lot.  I have my Saturdays back for a while.  Life is ok. It's not good.  My grade took a serious dive last six weeks and it's looking very likely I'll take home my first D on a report card ever.  I may be able to raise it before it gets on my transcript, but not before the six weeks.  And more than likely Mom and Dad will make me quit New Dimension next year if that happens. One more thing:  Orson Scott Card remains the best author ever.  I highly recommend "Maps in a Mirror".   It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

      That quote is from Jersey Girl, which I just saw. I love Liv Tyler, but it's funny because Ben Affleck tries to act. Like, with human emotions.  Jonah-- Yeah, Nathan can definitely read Monstrous Regiment. It is good, isn't it? :) I think the only reason I bought the Corndog thing was because I was in a heightened emotional state, due to my recent publication. And the Moulin Rouge soundtrack does have some of the good songs on it. Like the Elephant Love Medley. I love the Elephant Love Medley. I love it whenever Ewan McGregor belts out pretty words.  Plus, if you guys who were gone haven't heard about JournalCon 1.5 yet, all I can say is that it involved the word "bitchpants." Quite a lot. And how often do you get to say that?  I'll go do the Friday Five now.    It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

      I'm back!!! So the trip to Florida was full of Comstock-like hilarity, some of which will soon surface on Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog.  When we actually got to Florida, there were many Comstocks and therefore much more hilarity, including: -My cousin David who brought his girlfriend to meet the Comstocks after only nine months of dating. -My cousin Paula's husband, Georgio, whose English is very good, but is still week enough to lead to several amusing translation stories. -The quote "I feel like a lizard!" actually making sense. -The mysterious "mini golfing" trips. I also went shopping, and my aunt paid as her b-day present to me.  I got: Newsies on DVD, Silly Songs with Larry on CD, and the Moulin Rouge soundtrack (which sucks, because they axed good songs that were in the movie in favor of "Moulin Rouge inspired" crap by "popular" artists).   I'm happy to report that my cousin Paula in Italy is going start reading TftosotC and, possibly, by extension, CoS.  That is, when she gets a computer in her new house, which is the next priority after running water and a bed.  So that means international readership for Jonah!  By the way, thank you very much Michael for ruining my joke, which Erin actually seemed to be buying. And speaking of Erin, as soon as I finish posting I will go over to Fanfiction.net and start reading!    BTW, I loved Monstrous Regiment.  Can Nathan read it before I return it?

      It's Friday Five Time. (NATHAN AND SOPHIA, PLEASE DO LAST WEEK'S FIRST!)   1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  Michael: Short and Straight. Jonah:  Straight, short, and generally psycho Erin: wavy, and sort of a middle-length Nathan: My hair flips... right.  both sides do.  I hate it.  It's fairly long for a guy. Thomas: My hair sort of fluctuates. I think it is mostly medium lenth and straight. Sophia:  My hair is flip-y.  It flips out at the ends...and, medium length?  2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  Michael: It was longer and then it was shorter and now it's kind of in the middle again. Jonah:  It fell out when I was two, but since its grown back it's been more or less the same, save the rat tail fiasco, which is best forgotten. Erin: It was curly, then it was straight, then it was wavy and frizzy... I don't want to talk about the bangs. They were bad. Nathan:  More than I can say. Thomas: First it was normal parted, then it was bowl cut, then buzz cut, and now back to sort of normal part.  Sophia:  Long, short, long, short, orange.  3. How do your normally wear your hair?  Michael: However the hell it looks when I get out of bed. Seriously. Jonah:  Diddo, except on Sundays when I put a bunch of gel on it. Erin: down Nathan: With pride. Thomas: Great answer Nathan. I wear my hear however it wants to be worn. It talks to me every morning after I wake up with its requests. Sophia:  out of my face.  4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  Michael: It would be blue. No it wouldn't. I don't know! I like my hair the way it is! Jonah:  It would be cooperative. Erin: It would no longer be frizzy, but would make up it's mind as to whether it wants to be curly or straight. Nathan:  Flourescent blue.  And not just highlights, either. Thomas: I would have longer sideburns, dyed hot pink. Sophia:  MINE WOULD BE HOT PINK, TOO!!!  5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  Michael: My hair got overchlorinated and nasty when I was in Kindergarten. That's actually the only thing. Jonah:  It's consistently bad, but not disastrous. Erin: Not to my recollection. There have been many days of Magrat hair, but I've learned to love them. Nathan: On the bus home from Branson it did some pretty weird stuff, but I thought it actually looked pretty cool. Thomas: My hair has generally been pretty calm, and it knows that I do not tolerate disasters. Sophia:  Oh, in 3rd grade I got it cut awfully and looked dreadful.  But that's about it.

      Ok, so that made absolutely no sense, but y'know what?  I don't care.  Welcome back Marten, you crazy drama king.  Very sorry about Merryl, can't wait to see the chess set.  Anyway, it's now been summer for 2 1/2 days and It's not been as relaxing as I hoped. Commencement, open houses, relatives - I just want to relax.  Plus, I missed my first Corndog update since I went once a week.  That kinda sucks. At least I had a good time at Erin's open house.  It was too bad Marten and Thomas couldn't make it. OH wel, we'll all meet up at Youth Group at least.  I want to STUFF the MONKEY! ^Can anyone explain this!?!

      Marten's back! Wow! I had four days! I win the bet!  Okay, now for my first JournalCon-less post in a while.  I hate the Cicadas. My mom hates them too and has been freaking out since March when she found out that they were coming. On the other hand Dad has been sympathetic to the cicadas, thinking that we were all big wusses and that as long as the didn’t bother him, he would remain blasé about them. That’s until one of them got in his car. Yeah. So now dad is firmly in the anti-cicada camp. He’s been rambling about cicadas for the last twelve hours, and when we went to the video store in Marsh, he told the clerk that he had cicadas in his car, and then he bought a bottle of Raid Flying Insect Killer, but I wisely checked the side to see what it killed, and it was more Fruitfly than Cicada. So we got the one that kills crickets. Personally, I don’t think anything short of Sarin will work, but it’s his money.  I saw Miracle last night, and in between realizing that Kurt Russell as Herb Bloom is Jonah’s  urlLink fashon guru *, I realized that it was possible for America to dream again, especially after four years with the most ineffectual president ever. (Jimmy Carter is a good man. Good President? Not so much…) Actually I realized that a movie that could have been pure undriven treacle was actually pretty damn good, because of a few different factors. 1.) Patricia Clarkson 2.) The Hockey players were very good, and managed to act pretty well considering that the were actual hockey players and not actors. 3.) Patricia Clarkson 4.) The last scene is still suspenseful even though you know how it’s going to end 5.) Patricia Clarkson 6.) It’s remarkably done, and better than it should have been, because of… 7.) Patricia Clarkson  I’m staying home today instead of going to a race party at some friends of my parents house. I have to do laundry, but it’s still worth it.  Okay, I’m pretty much done here. This is Michael Christie, signing off.  *I couldn't find a good picture of his pants, but the man had a serious plaid fetish.  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

      Hello all. I'm back from Vincennes! It was a lot of fun!  I got this crazy old chess set!  The pieces are hand carved and you can't tell what they are, but it's really Cor!  I also met this girl named Merryl, and she's really cool.  Unfortunately, she lives in a trailer with no computer and no telephone, and I lost her address, so I can't send her letters.  Anyway, After sleeping on it for a couple of days, I decided that my departure from Compendium was a little rash and I'm back.  But we seriously need to do more blogging and less party planning. Ok?  And Rachel and Sophia - post more!  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

      and that is precisely why it's important to keep on living, to not give up hope."  I needed the entire quote there. It's just a great quote.  Okay, Marten's left the blog. Where do we go from here? Since one of the reasons that Marten left was because Compendium "had become a message board for planning parties", I have to ask, Do you want fewer JournalCons? No JournalCons? I had just planned out the summer because it would be hard for me to make rounds and plan them the way I usually did because we're not in school. So if I seemed anal and controlling, that's the only reason why.  On a different note, I met two of the Sushi People! Ashley (who is awesome) and...and...I think there was another one, but I for some reason don't remember her. Which is sad. But Ashley was cool. And so was "The Day After Tomorrow". It was a great summer movie, I loved it, I loved the trailers before it, only problem was the lame-ass wolf subplot. Very uncool. Everything else rocked.  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

There is, of course a  urlLink logical explanation  for everything, but they didn't know that.  Oh well, at least nothing else can surprise them too much.

      I'm rejiggering JournalCons again!  We're going to continue with WestWingCon (Season One) on June 4th, because Erin doesn't care if she's there or not. I tried to do Top ten of the season, but there are too many damn subplots so we're going with fifteen.  Here's the final list: RERUN: Sports Night "Quo Vadimus" 1. Pilot 2. Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc 3. A Proportional Response 4. Five Votes Down 5. The Crackpots and These Women 6. Mr. Willis of Ohio 7. The Short List 8. In Excelsis Deo 9. He Shall, From Time to Time 10. Celestial Navigation 11. Six Meetings Before Lunch 12. Let Bartlet Be Bartlet 13. Mandatory Minimums 14. Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics 15. What Kind of Day Has It Been  August 27th will hopefully be a CutCon, anything we don't get to at the MovieCons will go there I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

      SO much to say... and yet absolutely nothing.  I'm Bass section leader next year.  Technically I'll be in charge of ten other people.  They won't listen, but that's a problem for next year.  It still makes me happy. What does not make me happy is that the "recommended" summer dance classes are now mandatory... for me.  And only me.  But oh well.  I need it. The new SRT system sucks!  Is it happening at LC too?  I need to know so I can figure out how to structure my rant. Also it is way too hard to get a drivers license in this city.  Bureaucracy sucks. Besides those unrelated pseudorants, I have very little to say, so I'll leave you with a really bad poem.  Trees aren't blue Neither are you You know what to do So give me my shoe  This isn't funny It's really just random Keep doing stuff like this And you won't develop a fandom  That last line sucked and so does this poem so I'm gonna stop now.  I hope you enjoyed that, but somehow I doubt it.  I'll post again when I make sense.  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

      Maybe that's more of a CD title.  ANYWAY!  I haven't been to church in a month and I don't plan on going back EVER!  SO THERE!  ha.  Just kidding, sorry, I don't know where that came from.  Now I'm really sad that I didn't go to MOM!!!  Wait, was Kelly in it?  Cuz if she was...I swear to Buddha...she's dead!!!  That evil little girl hasn't talked to me in so long!  COMSTOCK!  Tell Kelly to talk to me.  Got it?  I don't even particularly care which one of you does it...I know that both of you know her.  But not everyone does, so, back to my point.  What was my point?  Oh yeah.  I haven't been here in forever!  And, as retarded as I am, I so can NOT find this calendar thing.  I know that you explained everything earlier, Michael, and I thank you for that, but I'm much too lazy to go back and look, and, besides, I'm only writing this to procrastinate more on writing my Drama critique.  You know what?  I just won't do it!  I was just doing it for extra credit anyway.  Well, poo on that!  If I may say so myself!  HMMPH!  Anyway.  Again.  Bye!  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

      Hi, guys. I'm glad to hear that MoM went so well; I would've loved to have gone. And I want to thank you guys for saying I didn't have to-- that means you are first-class, stand-up guys.  Oh, dear. Okay. This is all I have to say about the youth group situation, and then I hope it's all done. The idea that religion isn't important to us, or whatever, probably came from my post, although that's not what I meant to imply at all. It's just that I went to Sunday School for eight years. I've been confirmed. And I've been in groups where you just learn the seven sacraments over and over, but then I've also been in groups where everybody knows the sacraments and we get to talk about more personal aspects of faith. So Marten, Thomas, and Michael convinced me to come to youth group and I thought, okay, these are people I would be happy to do that with. I feel really bad for contributing to the breakdown of the larger group. I felt horrible when Patty pointed it out, I felt horrible when Jonah pointed it out. And I do appreciate that you guys have to keep going there and have to find some way to make it work. The point of my earlier post was more to make a suggestion than to complain, but if it rubbed people the wrong way, I'm sorry. Really. I know you're all wonderful people, and I'm sure Patty and the rest of the people in the group are as well. I'm done talking now.  On a lighter note, Lookit! I learned how to change the thingy!  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

      Hey guys!  I'm sorry it's been so incredibly long since I've last updated...I've been pretty busy as you can tell.    Anyway, I'm assuming that the Comstocks made Jekyll and Hyde...?  I know The Pirate King did.  Good Job!  Mr. Stafford said that I was one of the people on the list of names of those they wanted, but when it came down to it, I just had too many conflicts.  Poo.  I really wanted to be in it!  But it makes me feel better to know that I didn't make it because of my soccer schedule and not because I have no talent.  Recently I went back to Fall Creek Valley with Central Sound.  It brought back a lot of memories.  I saw Mr. Rawlinson...he didn't remember me, but that's okay!  "Faster Pace, Higher Level, Pay Attention to Detail!" ha!  Mrs. Springer was running around the school...she remembered me, so that made me happy!  She still has the Anne Frank quote on the giant pencil above her door, and the students just recently did the poems...I remember Jonah's rendition of "The Raven."  That was some great stuff!  I heard that Mrs. Williams has cancer or something, so she's gone now...sad.  Sixth grade English and Literature would never have been the same without her!  Oh, and tell me why when I got home that night I started downloading some School House Rock songs?  Yay Mr. Harvey!  That's all for now kids!  I've gotta get some last minute memorizing in for my drama final!  The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      BTW, that's not a cop-out.  I'm seriously considering it for my autobiography title.   Anyway, I apologize for some of what I said. I was a little upset about the King's Island thing, how it seems like you guys are intentionally setting up for a confrontation.  I think you guys care about the group more than I thought - you just want to make some changes, and that's fair.  So, let's just try to do it in a peaceful way. Also, thank you all so much for coming to PseudoMOM.  If you enjoyed watching it half as much as we enjoyed putting it on, than we enjoyed it twice as much as you. In conclusion, I love you all. (But in a totally nonsexual way)  (Except for Sophia) (No, just kidding) (Mostly)   The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      I added the template, and it's random and funny and part of Jacob's Wrinkle in Time recap. Go read it.   Okay, Jonah, I think you're taking a tad too much credit for the bringing of people into the Youth Group. I recommended it to Erin, so that was pretty much me, although it is indirectly related to you. And also the part about us not liking the religion part is such complete and utter bullshit it's not even funny. I never said I had a problem with the religious part or the worship. That's fine, I knew that would be a part of a church sponsored Youth Group. But to play the same games every week will just end in madness! And also if Kraig is the person I'm thinking of, he specifically said that he was going to be busy for a while and wouldn't be coming!   And, yeah. I joined the group so we could hang out together. That's pretty much the only reason I'm there. I'm sorry if the desire to see Jonah and Nathan more than once every two months is such a bad thing, if it is, than believe me, I won't be coming back in two weeks.  By the way, AnimationCon is dead, So the new schedule looks something like this: June 1 - WestWingCon (Season 1) - 3:00  June 11 - MovieCon! - 3:00  June 18 - WestWingCon (Season 2) - 3:00  July 17 - MusicalCon! With Special Guest "Camp" - 4:00   Note the changes.   Okay, I went to meeting of the minds, and if I had wanted to shove sharp metal objects in Jonah's eye earlier, the desire is all but gone now. LN Lyceum rocks. The funniest moment of the night? I'm not going to play favorites with the sketches, but when Mrs. Means got up and started talking about how great the class was and how her car broke and how she didn't bring snacks, the entire class was standing up there like when Michael Moore (ASS!) brought all of the Documentary nominees on stage and started yelling at Bush and then the people behind him were wondering "What am I doing here?" and rolling their eyes and looking like Deer in headlights.   Seriously, y'all rock. Props to you. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      Jonah, if you're pinning crap on me, then you are in for such a flogging.  I'm not in full agreement with Michael's post, but I'm not happy with the way Patty overreacts to things. I apologize for sunday, it was largely my fault we weren't involved, but I'm bringing board games to the next meeting, because hide and seek is just really boring when it's not a lock-in.  Especially when your locked out of the hiding place the first game and yelled at for not playing the second.  Still, I'm all for a more unified youth group, where we can actually plan things, but just by our nature we're going to be atleast slightly disorganized, and Patty needs to realize this and work with us instead of helping to create an atmosphere in which we're working against her.  Perhaps Erin is right, and she isn't the person to be working with older kids.  I'm hoping you(jonah) can take a little more control, I feel like under your leadership that we can be, for the most part, self directed and Patty can worry about the younger kids.  Who added this template? It's stupid. It's not funny, just stupid. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      I'm tired of this.  I have to spend two more years with Patty, and with you guys (exceptin' Erin).  This uneasy peace, with you guys talking about her behind her back, is not gonna last.  And it puts me in a difficult and unfair position.  After all, intentionally or not, I brought you guys to the group more or less.  So any conflict that arises is gonna be my fault.  I like you guys and Journalcons, but I also owe the group my support, if not for Patty herself than for the church.  And you all don't seem to have noticed that as our little clique grows, we're losing people.  Has anybody seen Kraig lately?  Does anyone know where he is?   As Erin said, you joined the group so we could hang out together.  I think that's the wrong reason.  If you don't like Patty and you don't want to do Youth Group things (which, amazingly enough, involve religion) than consider whether you should be coming.  Because to join the Youth Group, scare away other people, and then bitch about Patty and how things are run seems stupid and counterproductive. So that's my stance. (BTW, It's worth noting that most of that stuff doesn't really apply to Thomas or Nathan.)   The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      Nathan and Thomas, There's no "c" in Jekyll. Just for the record. Props to Jonah and Marten for spelling it right. Hat of shame is to be equally split among the two of you.  Since Erin is leaving the 27th of August (something she didn't POST ON THE CALENDAR!), I call for a boycott of the King's Island trip. We already have MovieCon that week, and I don't want to rejigger the schedule. King's Island going to be lame anyway, because King's Island is over-rated and going means spending an entire day with Patty, and that's just not cool.   So, you're either in or you're out. Right now.  The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      Arrgh! Michael, I TOLD you already, over and over, that I'm leaving on the 27th of August! So please bump musicalcon up!  Haha, you're all in school right now. And I'm not. I got up at 10:43. I'm still wearing my pajamas. Smugness.  I have to agree with Michael in that there should be two youth groups. I'm personally not much of a youth group person in that I keep my religious things very private, and the whole "let's all hold hands and pray and quote Bible verses and sing songs with total strangers" thing kind of makes me uncomfortable. But I think it would be much better if there was a younger group who could do that, and an older group that could be more self-directed... like, we know the Bible stories already, what do we think about them? Plus, I really don't think Patty knows how to handle older kids. Especially not older kids like us. I started coming to the youth group to hang out with you guys, not be yelled at by this perpetually jumpy woman. So, all in all, I'm kind of glad it's pretty much over for me. Anyway.

      Comstocks, there is no possible way that you could appreciate either Levi or ChewBaccalaureates enough. For tonight was the night when two became one. No, wait that's not at all what happened. It was like Jed and Josh in "We Killed Yamamoto" or Jeremy and Natalie in "And the Crowd Goes Wild". For tonight, the continuing conflicts within the CPC Youth Group came to a head.  I'm going to recap this for the Comstocks and Paul, because they have every right to know. Tonight, Patty had us play the Hide and Go Seek game, with one of the younger girls as "it." She proceeded to hide in the bi-partisan bathroom (Okay, it's uni-sex, whatev.) So we looked and eventually everyone was gone, and decided that they were in the bathroom. So we tried to get in, but the entire youth group was inside that bathroom, and ended up deciding to keep us locked out. Eventually, I said "Screw It." and we went back to the room-thingy. I warmed up a pizza and munched on it while we waited for them to come back. I made the "I find you loathesome and my hatred of you knows no bounds joke" when they did. So they decide to do round 2, and Thomas volunteers to hide, in what is the only other hiding space in the entire church, the darkened Choir Closet/Room/Thing. So we're not exactly thrilled with playing it again, especially as they didn't really seem to want us to play it. So we sat and talked for a while, and Patty came out and asked why we weren't playing, and I said, "Wasn't fun the first time, won't be the second." which was pretty much one of my "call it as I see it moments", but it was patronizing and Marten chastised me for it. He was right, as usual. Eventually the collective group figured out that was only one other hiding spot in the entire church, so they found Thomas, and paraded back to the room-thingy. Thomas came and sat down with us, and we talked for a couple of minutes before worship.  Then Patty came.  She wasn't happy with us sitting out of the game, because it's a youth group and it's supposed to be one and not two groups and that the fact that we sat out sent the message that we were better than everyone else or something else "that [she] could not begin to fathom". So we went back to the room-thingy and we sat through the stiffest Worship session ever, and then Patty decided to "clear the air" which basically was yet another passive-aggressive attack on Erin, Marten and I not playing Hide and Go Seek. By then it was 7:30 and we all left.  I'm not going to editorialize. I'm just going to say two things.  1.) There's something wrong with a Youth Group expects High Schoolers to play Tag and Hide and Go Seek, week after week after week and also enjoy it. 2.) It's a two group Youth Group. The High Schoolers are going to segregate as their own group and The Girls segregate as their own group and with an age range as broad as the one at this group, it cannot be reasonably expected to function as one single group all the time.  I'm probably hypocritical in saying this, but the Youth Group isn't working. Considering that I just joined the group two months ago, I'm not a expert on the dynamics and structure of a Church Youth Group. But sometimes an outsider is able to see things that others miss. It's the whole principle behind editing. I'm not going to be able to change policy, that'll (probably) be Jonah and Thomas's jobs. But we need change, and we need it soon. For this youth group will unite or it will fall.  The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      Okay, Since I'm too lazy to edit that post, bump every one down a week so that the first Con is the 11th of June and the last one is the 27 of August.  Also: Thomas is too busy. He's like a Comstock on steroids. He's going to be the first Compendium-er to have an ulcer. Or possibly drop dead of exhaustion.  The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

      Hey, Erin, guess what?  Stephanie Gunderson is going to Hanover.  Isn't that cool?  She remembers you from elementary and middle school and was excited to hear you were going.  Anyway, in other news: Today is the first day of the rest of my life, the last day of my life so far, and the middle day of a period of time which contains an amount of time before it and after it which are equal.  The point of all that? There is none. Enterprise is safe, at least for another year.  UPN is still to scared to axe Star Trek.  I'm happy, because I think the show is finally coming into it's own and getting pretty good.  It's still not level with TNG or DS9, but it's on Voyager or Original Series footing. Match up: 11 1/2 wins, because of the reason.  The square root of orange also wins, but only on a technicality.  Since I cannot surpass that level of weird, I will end the match-ups.  Some day, I will start a new feature, a great feature, an amazing feature, the feature to end all features.  But that day is not today!

      I feel sad, and I don't know why... This has been going on for awhile now, and if anyone can inform me why I am sad, it would be greatly appreciated. In other news, section leaders, drum majors, band council members, and the concept/music of next years show were announced tonight. Jack McCarthy is now a drum major, which is a complete shock and joy. The trumpets will now be able to run the band through a puppet regime! The tyrannical reign of John Trippy is now officially over with the crowning of Natalie Perry, Becky Boruff, and Georgia Kuss as our new section leaders. Alice is also now a flute section leader. No one else knows the other section leaders. Our show next year will be completely awesome, but apparently I am not allowed to share with you what its concept is. I shall tell you all at a later time. On further note, school is almost over huzzah!! Congratulations to Marten, Jonah, and Nathan for all making Jeckyll and Hyde! By the time you read this, I will be 16! Finally.... I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      Okay, when I created the calendar, I didn't do it for my own benefit. Don't say "I have Triennium, blah, blah, blah, fishcakes." Post it on the calendar. Thank you.   I'm open to hosting a double JournalCon. But I'm not sure that the current format of JournalCons (Watch TV, eat Pizza) would work well. I may be wrong. Float The West Wing by them and see what they think. I'm open to other idea (but I really don't think having them at any of the Bring-Your-Own-MovieCons is a good idea, we're pushing 24 hours of movie as it is.  Also, the Login for the calendar is your Last name, first initial, and your password has eight letters and rhymes with "assword". You can change it to meet your needs upon login.

      My summer schedule is shaping up.  Jeckyll and Hyde, learning to drive, hopefully working with Somalian refugees, plus Triennium and Show Choir camp.  Besides all that, part of each day has to be devoted to working out for Show Choir season and relearning German II.  Hopefully there'll still be some time to relax. If not, though, I won't complain.  I'm learning how to enjoy the busy life.  I'm sure it's something that'll come in handy later in life.  I only have two things left to say to you, and that was one, and I guess technically that was the other one, which makes this the third so actually I'm already way over.

      Ok, I don't know whose autobiography that is, but it's a wicked good title.  Maybe for Martha Stewart.  Anyway, Nathan and I made chorus!  And so did Marten!  And Sarah and I were talking, and we want to have a double journalcon with the sushi people at some point.  Some of them are interested in meeting some of you or something. Paul, that is a strange project indeed, but I have a master plan to make mine awesome. Today's match-up.  11 1/2 vs the square root of an orange.  11 1/2 is armed with happiness, and the square root of an orange is clad in swiss cheese.  They are playing psychological death handball by notation. The results of the last match, which was kept a secret for government reasons, is that General Brooks won, but the Easter Bunny was darn close.  Everything else is classified. So, that's about it.

Also, Marten (there I spelled it right) do you still play magic?  If so, Tyler and I need a third person for and 3 on 3 sealed deck tournament on Saturday at the convention center.  Speaking of Tyler, he says his invitation to the blog has expired, would someone send him another one?  One last thing, I have the most bizarre final for AP world history.  I have to make a wood carving like ones made by the Maori peoples of New Zealand that represents me.  That's my final exam grade.  That is 25% of my grade.  How strange?

      I have one day of high school left. It really hasn't hit me yet. It still seems like there's so much crap to do, and I don't think I'll be able to completely relax until I've seen my final grades. One Acts is tonight. Ha ha. That should be interesting. I can't believe I only have one more day as an active LC student. It's weird. It's scary. Hold me.  Irrelevant spoiler of the day: I am running out of irrelevant spoilers. I must consider changing their format. For today, how about this... Episode III will probably be nothing like the episode of Gilmore Girls I have to miss tonight because of the stupid One Acts. I would say that's pretty accurate.  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      Marten, I hate to bring your hopes down, but there were fifty-nine people there today, and at least twenty were guys.  We all still might have gotten in, but I certainly don't think any of us have it 'made'.  And Rachel tried out! And she danced like a whore!  Yay, Rachel!   I got called back, but not to sing.  I read for Utterson and then for Lord Savage, and then they told me to leave.  Six or seven guys stayed after I and four or five others were dismissed.  We're supposed to be called sometime tommorow.  Hopefully I'll be home. Since I won't post tommorrow: Happy Birthday Ashley, thanks for sharing 5 1/2 of your 192 months with me.

      I realized the 28th didn't work after I posted it, but forgot to change it. I like the 4th though. Any Con invented by a person is held at that person's house. That means that they have to cover all expenses up to and including food and drink and also have to have comfy sitting area. Paul and the Comstocks have this, I've never been to the homes of Marten, Erin, Sophia, Thomas, Rachel or Tyler so I can't judge their homes yet, however, I'm allergic to cats, so I don't think Marten's house will work.  Okay Here's the schedule for Cons: MovieCon, WestWingCon, AnimationCon, WestWingCampCon, MusicalCon. We'll set dates to these when we get to that bridge.  Okay, Tim's a little bitch, so I have to go.

      Oops! I forgot to mention that May 28th totally doesn't work for me. It does something completely the opposite of working. As does every single day in May up until the 30th, (although I think either the 30th or the 31st is also off) and also June 4, 5, and 6. I suggest we do it sometime after school gets out but before June 4th. That's just my opinion. The 28th is my graduation rehearsal during the day and my cousin's graduation in the evening. Also, how about doing it at somebody else's house this time? Also, does anyone else have an opinion on what movie I'm bringing? Also, if everybody wants Love Actually we have to have a separate StarWarsCon. Before or after September when the OT DVD comes out is up to you.  When do I get to do the thingy at the bottom, and how?  Irrelevant spoiler: You see that? They did that with CGI.   I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      Okay, Galaxy Quest, Munchausen, Lost In Translation, (my pick)Love Actually and Ferris Bueller are in, even though I have ideological objections with it and Matthew Broderick. Seriously if I had to pick an actor who did funny work in the eighties, let his career slip in the 90s and who does great stage work now, I'd pick  urlLink this guy . Broderick's just so smarmy! Although, he does get points for playing Bloom in The Producers. Still he impregnated Sarah Jessica Parker with his smarmy spawn and that is unacceptable!  By the way:  AnimationCon:  Erin: Rachel: Tyler: Paul: Jonah: Chicken Run Nathan:  Michael: Spirited Away Thomas: Sophia:DUMBO!!! Marten:  and...  MusicalCon: Erin: Camelot Rachel: Tyler: Paul: Jonah: Either Into the Woods or Newsies Nathan: Camp (if I can get a copy on DVD) Michael: The Sound of Music Thomas: Sophia:undecided...dangit.

Dynomite is not for use with mouths.  This is a valuable lesson, because when forgotten it leads to lots of corrective dental work.  And speaking of corrective dental work, The country of Nigeria is soon to be taken over by hungry penguins.  However, this is not as bad as it sounds.  Because soon after they've taken over they'll have lunch, and then they'll be normal non-hungry penguins.  and everyone knows that nonhungry penguins ae easily removed. Now onto wax: No. And now, onto the fifth chapter of the wombat.  A long time ago in a small glass jar, there wasn't a wombat.  Wasn't?  Uh oh, it must have escaped!!!! Oh no!  Watch out, it could be anywhere. Except Atlantic city. You know why?  Cause ur mom, that's why!  Boo-Yah! In conclusion, if you see my sanity, tell it it can stay in Hawaii, I'm doing just fine without it!   I only have one thing left to say to you, and it's that my pants are on fire!!!!

      Yeah, pathetic title, I know.  Anyway, I have no idea what movie I want to bring.  You completely annhilated (i spelled that wrong, didn't I?  curse late nights and little sleep!) two of my favorite genres.  Does Silly Songs with Larry count as a musical?  Cuz I understand that Dumbo's out thanks to the AnimationCon and Grease and whatnot is out until MusicalCon or whatever it'll be called...why don't you have a "ChickFlickCon" too so that I'm further lost.  Yet not in translation.  Haha.  I'm hilarious.  Anyway, I still have no idea what movie to bring.  I'm sure Pirates of the Caribbean is taken or all bloggers are exhausted with the stunning performance of Johnny Depp.  But I DON'T KNOW what to bring!  I'll end up bringing a tape-turned-DVD of my 5th grade musical production thing and make ya'll sit through it.  Ha, how'd you like THAT?!  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      Well, boys and girls, as far as movie JournalCon goes, I would like to put it to a vote. It shall be either Attack of the Clones, because Michael hasn't seen it (complete with constant snarking, of course-- I wouldn't ask anyone to watch it with a straight face), or Love Actually. For those of you who don't feel informed enough to vote, I shall inform you. AOTC is a rollicking impressive CGI adventure into the Star Wars universe, critically acclaimed as "better than The Phantom Menace." It chronicles the beginning of the Clone Wars, which were made famous in A New Hope with the line, "You fought in the Clone Wars?" (Indeed he did, Luke. Indeed he did.) Obi-Wan Kenobi is sent off to hunt down assassins (See "Dex's Diner") while, for reasons beyond all comprehension, the Jedi Council decides to send Anakin Skywalker to guard Senator Padme Amidala's body. They go to a pretty secluded place and Ani proceeds to seduce the Senator very badly. (Featuring the Worst Pickup Line Ever! And Intense Staring!) This is okay, however, because the Senator is very bad at being seduced. She keeps saying things like, "Don't look at me like that. It makes me uncomfortable," and "You'll be expelled from the Order," and "It will destroy us." Silly Padme. The only way to solve this problem is, of course, to go to Tatooine. Then there's a battle. There's nothing like a near-death experience for finding the way to a woman's heart. Love Actually is, indeed, The Ultimate Romantic Comedy. I can't recap all the plots, because look how long it took me to do just one. Basically, there's a wedding, there's an affair, people fall in love, Christmas is all around me, and on Christmas you tell the truth, and American girls are easy, and Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, and Hugh Grant dancing around because he's Prime Minister and Billy Bob Thornton is President, and Keira Knightley, and female half nudity, and Portugese, and Liam Neeson and the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport, and love actually is all around.  I vote for Yoda. Do I even need to explain why?  Fanfic rec of last week ("You might not care," etc.): "Pinch in Time." It's a Discworld fic, Carrot and Angua. Basically, Angua tries to run away again, but this fic is different from all the others with this setup, because Carrot can't say "Don't." Because somebody broke his lifetimer. And now Angua and Death and a dwarf watchman and Susan have to find out who and why and save him. I don't know if it'll get finished, it hasn't been updated in a while, but it's good. Poor Angua. It sucks to be a werewolf. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      Nathan: If 40% of the running time of the movie has singing occuring, then it's a musical. Also, I'm considering an AnimationCon, so hold off on Animated movies too.  Also,  urlLink Monday   is a big day for Nathan and Marten.  Enjoy Boston, you two!  [Would have been funnier if it were Jonah and I, if you remember that one youth group meeting. plus nate has a girlfriend, making him immune to gay jokes-Marten]  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      Gospel Music rules, y'all.  Sophia, you missed a great show.  Just wanted to say that.  Ashley's birds apparently want me dead.  Except Ziggy.  I like Ziggy.  He hasn't bitten me yet.  Angel, on the other hand, tried to eat my face last night. [of course, knowing you two, Ashley probably did, too-Marten]    Michael:  Could you please define 'musical' for us.  It's a thin line sometimes.  I mean,there's movies with singing that aren't really musicals, but some people call them musicals.  And common musicals that are  technically  opera.  So I need to know exactly what you consider to be a musical before I choose a movie.  In other news, the lack of votes in the democratic primary resulted in a tie between Daniel and The Duckman, and the Duckman won that pong match.  Daniel, however is his running mate.  Palpatine has chosen Christopher Lee as his running mate.  Sharpton is running as an independant.  Now for the incredibly politically absurd and cheesy 'green party' election.  Nominees are: Kermit the Frog Yoda Larry the Cucumber The Wicked Witch of the West Ralph Nader (wearing green paint) SO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      I auditioned for Jekyll and Hyde today, and it went well, I suppose. I wasn't the first to be sent away, but not the last either. I'm pretty sure I've got atleast a chorus part. In terms of casting, at best I'm a pimp, at worst I'm a manservant. Ironic, isn't it?  I might try out for Fiddler on the Roof at Carmel Community theatre as a back up Meanwhile, check out the lobby! I sound good again!  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

      Okay, I'm in the early stages of planning MovieJournalCon. Does May 28th work for everyone? (Marten and I will be in Vincennes--Thomas) It's the day that school ends, ergo it's a half day, and we're going to need extra time for all these movies anyway. So edit your choices for movies in here below.  RESTRICTIONS are ars follows:  *NO MUSICALS! (We're having a seperate JournalCon for them. So don't bring one.) *Nothing over 140 minutes in length.  * NOTHING ON VHS!  DVD ONLY.  This is an absolute must.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Pick Your Movies.  Erin:   Sophia:   Marten:  The Adventures of Baron Munchausen  Michael:  Lost In Translation  Jonah:  Galaxy Quest  Nathan: If Erin chooses Love Actually, I choose Episode II  Rachel:   Thomas:  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  Paul:  Dr. No  Tyler:   You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      Wow, Paul. It's only four years into the new millennium, so it might be a little early to pick the stupidest move yet. As of now, here are the nominees.  NBC greenlighting "Coupling" and "Whoopi": May 2002 The war in Iraq: March 2003 Sorkin leaving "The West Wing": May 2003 Terrorists deciding to invoke the wrath of a Republican President: September 2001 Paul spelling  Marten's   name wrong at Compendium of Stupidity: May 2004.  By the way, the titular speech is my persuasive speech, which I already posted on. I got the grade back and despite horrible horrible delivery, I still managed an 89. That's almost an A! Ha! What do you think of me now, suckas?   You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses  quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      I've got a massive splitting headache right now. The stupidest kid in an Algebra class chock full of stupid kids stole my special pen that Jonah gave me. I have to stay after school for Math Tutoring and ride the activity bus home, thanks to a deal with the  Federales . My name is Michael, and today is one of the longest days of my life.  Clever opening, huh? LC was interesting today, there was a house fire over by Harrison Hill and the smoke was being pumped into the ventilation system. Naturally, we smell smoke while in the Scene Shop. So we're freaking out because the scene shop is filled with paint (that's flame retardant, but still...), muslin, and a whole lot of wood. So we freak out until they find the source of the problem, namely the housefire on 56th St. We all had a good laugh about it afterwards. And by 'good laugh', I mean, not so much with the laughing, but more with the loud talking.  I'm ready to declare Hall Sweeps a massive failure. Teacher's aren't locking their doors. Students are being missed by the metaphorical "brooms". So it's a yet another spectacular failure by the LC Admistration that will go down in the Hall of Really Bad, Stupid, Ill-Concieved Ideas with  urlLink Edsels   and  urlLink The New Coke     Claire IMed me again last night and said "I think you're cute and I've had fun talking to you and I'd like you to ask me out." Okay, I totally added those last two, but she did say that she thought I was cute, which is a big deal...for me...  Eh...It'd never last.  urlLink LC/LN romances   never end up working out.  [Not to mention she's twice your size. It would be an LN Drama romance, only in reverse-Marten] Especially if you end up dating a girl who types with her face.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      Sorry to double post but this is really important!  But where do we fit in? How do I compare on the percentile-scale of true beauty? It's easy to find out! Here's the formula: "To do a self-analysis, draw an imaginary line from the pupil of your eye down toward your jaw. Draw a second line from the nostrils across your cheeks. The bottom of your cheekbone should fall at or below the intersection of these lines. If it is higher, your face may appear flat and masculine."  I am beautiful!  Next Time: The Trailer for The First Movie By Michael Christie. In Three Days, Brad Pitt is going to TRIM TIM: Volume One.  You invited all my friends!

      First off, Jonah, I need to have WORDS with you. Yes, they warrant capitalization. They also involve a person that I hate, and have said so to you on numerous occasions. If you weren't Poet Laureate of the Blog, I'd so absolutely kill you right now, it's not even funny. Also, you forgot Rachel in your Blog celebration, which also isn't funny.  I gave my anti-PE speech today, and it was absolutely disasterous. I didn't get 30 seconds into the speech before every person in that room was looking at me like "Oh my God, what is that crazy [white] boy thinking?". I just had not cards so a lot of the eloquency got lost in translation and I just stumbled through a my outline. It was awful. I have one word for Hall.  urlLink Tele-Prompter . Actually that's two words joined with a hyphen. My bad.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      So, I failed to mention that Ashley was cofounder of Ah, my aching sushi.  This led to some fighting and...(I'm editing out Ashley's sn, in case she'd rather it not be all over the net) The Squid3188: I'm really sorry about all the killing Ashley: It's ok The Squid3188: But noe you're a creepy undead zombie Ashley: I know Ashley: And I want to avenge my death The Squid3188: crap Ashley: Hmm...

A: I've known all along! A: YOu see, they had you do that, so that I'd kill YOU off The Squid3188: but why do I care if they're having an affair?

A: Right A: Give me a good reason not to The Squid3188: I'm on your side!  We're both victims.  But with my superpowers and your zombieness, we can defeat them A: Hmmm.... A: But what good would it do me? A: I'm already dead A: What do I care A: I could just kill you and then you and I could be dea together A: See? A: I'd have sompany The Squid3188: you said you wanted to avenge your death A: Yes A: ANd kill you The Squid3188: this is the way to do it The Squid3188: actually, no The Squid3188: you should kill me The Squid3188: that would teach them to run off with each other The Squid3188: we'll run off to a place they can't follow The Squid3188: very poetic A: Hmmm A: This reminds me of A midsummer night's dream A: But I don't know A: OR!

      I would like all of here at Compendium to give Jonah a huge round of applause for producing that amazing 500th post celebration! (And I say big I mean disc world big, like four elephants on the back of a turtle floating through space big). Edit in all your big rounds of applause for Jonah! Yay Jonah!!! Laurence Fishburne (from Maui): Go Jonah! -You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      Announcer: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to the Compendium of Stupidity once-in-a-lifetime event, the night you've all been waiting for, well, okay, the night some of you have briefly waited for and the rest of you don't know or care about, welcome to...    THE COMPENDIUM OF STUPIDITY 500 POST SPECTACULAR!    with your host, William Shatner! *Stunning lack of Applause* William Shatner:  Hi, I'm...   William Shatner.  Some of you...  May know me as... Captain James T. Kirk from....  Star Trek.  But today, I'm here to... host this... spectacular event. But first a... word from Jonah Comstock. Jonah: Guys, I'm really sorry.  It was a last minute thing, and he was the only celebrity I could get!  Really!  Laurence is in MAui, and all the good Star Trek actors have too much pride. Jonathan Frakes: Not me!  I'll do it!  Didn't you see the will work for food sign! Shatner:  Quiet you! Jonah: (Awkward pause)  Anyway, I'm sure he won't be too bad. Shatner:  Thank you... Jonah.  I'm supposed to.... introduce our first... speaker.  But, instead I'm going to... sing a song from my next... solo album. Donald Trump: You're Fired. Jonah:  He's so right.  Hey Donald, you want to host. Trump:  No, but I am interested in buying out this blog. Jonah:  We'll work this out.  Mean while, let's welcome our first guest, Marten. Marten:  Sometime ago, I started this fine blog late on a friday night. Maybe it was thursday,or some other night all together. The point is that I started it. and Nate didn't. Sure he was there, but it was my machine, dram it. I posted first. It was about thinking I was pregnant because of an irrational craving for peanuts. I'm glad I'm male.  Also, just because Michael had the first blog doesn't mean it was his idea. Jerry Springer:  We didn't tell Marten, but we've brought fellow bloggers Nathan and Michael to the studio. (At this point the words "He took credit for my blog and is sleeping with my mother" appear at the bottom of the screen) Nathan: You're taking credit for my blog! Michael:  And you're sleeping with my mother! (A humorous fight ensues, until the security finally tear them apart) Announcer:  We'll be back after these messages. Message 1:  The doctor called to confirm your appointment for 3:00 Message 2:  The Germans! They're invading! Ahhh! Message 3:  Don't do drugs. Announcer:  By "messages", I kinda meant advertisements. Messages:  Like anyone would pay to advertise on this show. Announcer: What ever.  Welcome back to the 500 post spectacular, with your host The Olsen Twins. Mary Kate (Or possibly Ashley):  You know, we ARE two people! The other one: Did you see that, Ashley?  Our speaker credits are even mixed up. Mar- Ash- Who cares?: That's it.  We are so leaving.  The next guest is somebody. Thomas: I have loved this blog like a child. I can't believe it's 500 now! It seems like yesterday when this blog was 10! It may seem like I ignored the blog for awhile, but it was a secret affair between the blog and I. (Thomas winks a huge wink at the camera) Jonah:  I kinda need to buy some time here. Trump:  Well, now that you mention it Jonah:  Quiet you!  Anyway, here's Amaris "Sarah" Moon, founder of Compendium-based blog "Oh my aching sushi." Sarah:  Compendium is the sole reason for my existence, the lone joy in my life, the one truth in a world of darkness. Without Compendium, there would be no such thing as "Oh, My Aching Sushi!" (collective gasp) Compendium is my inspiration to go out and make a difference in the world.  It has made me learn to stop and wonder about the big things in life, such conundrums as whether the staff at McDonald's is actually conspiring against me every time they forget the cheese on my Cheddar Melt. I owe everything to Compendium. Adam West:  Wow.  That was beautiful.  By the way, I'm Adam West.  You might remember me as Batman.  Remember Batman?  Wasn't he cool?  Wasn't I cool?  Cooler than Toby Macguire.  I mean what kind of super hero is a nerd? Jonah: *ahem* Adam West:  I'm here to tell you about how you can make money in your sleep. Jonah: *ahemhem* Adam West:  I mean, our next guest is Taul Pyler, who recently suffered a cloning accident, but is both a new blogger and a prospective one. Pyler:  Hi, I'm Tyler.  Or Paul.  Nevermind.  Anyway, I've only been with Compendium a little while but... Wait a minute, I'm not on Compendium yet, I'm still no wait.  I've got a headache.  No I don't! Announcer:  And that's all we have time for.  Now, to finish off this magical night, a montage of past templates  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.  SQEE! SQUEE! SQ(U)EE! Yar, This Be a Super Ball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway? Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.  Woof!  I don't like it. I don't like it at all.  It's okay! I had Subway!  Whats the point of calling it a laptop if you're not supposed to use it on your lap?  Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe! He'll try to tuck and roll, but it won't work because he has square pants  Does my sexiness offend you?  Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret.  I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose! Well, rotate my vertices and call me a trapezoid!  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.  Oy with the fishcakes already!  Stop Kemps! We're playing Euchre! The vegetable must be destroyed. The vegetable must NOT be destroyed!  History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.  History is about to crack wide open. Hold on to something.  History is a giant crack. Sorry, I couldn't help myself  But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!  It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat your dashboard with.  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'  Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes. Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.  Stop this war! Shame on you, Hobbits!  It arrests this war, his disonore of the main extremities of the title!  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle! Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.  Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?  This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.  It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!  It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.'  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.  Why shake hands when we can shake...other things? Like Lips.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies. Robo-host:  Well, that was just wonderful, wasn't it?  So many memories.  Now blog member Sophia would like to say a few words. Sophia: I just wanted- Robo-host: Word limit of few(def: 3) words reached.  Discontinue talking. Now, we'll conclude with Erin, who is with us via satellite. Erin:  Do I get to talk? Or are you going to cut me off? (pause for answer) Robo-host: 5 second pause signifies talking finished.  That's our show, goodnight everyone.  (Robo-host explodes)

      Whoa, I don't check in for a few days and bang everything is all...blue.  I kind of like it though.  Anyways, I got a new cello, and its a vast improvement over my old crappy cello with a crack in it.  What else, Oh yeah, I'm going to be on Cats eye next year.  For you LC people, its LN's news/announcment show.  I'll probably get stuck with some boring job like lighting though.  Also I played in a magic tournament and did really bad.  You wouldn't believe how anal some people are about the rules.    In a high whiney voice  "No, you can't play that because your second main phase is over and that signifies that all damage on the stack is removed so you'll have to wait until my upkeep to do that, and then it won't do you any good.

      I'm taking advantage of an altogether to brief respite in my incredibly busy life to complain about it.  I'm doing too much, and it's driving me insane.  I'll skip on the details.  But basically, I'm about to find out how much one person can take before he just shuts down.   Come spring pops show Wednesday at 7:00.  It's the only chance you'll get to see my hip and trendy disco attire.  Trust me, you don't want to miss it. My pants are tight and flair at the bottom.  It is most humorous. When things cool down and I have time, I'm gonna get my new blog up.  It will contain most humorous recaps of my life, leaving this blog for more intelligent discussion.  Things cool down around May 30th, btw. No.  The title makes no sense.  Don't ask.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      Okay, I'm grounded for a couple of days, so my posts will happen early in the morning, during lunch and after my parents go to sleep. Because I'm all about the circumvention.  I kind of miss the ability to read previous posts so that you could respond to things in them. That was cool. Damn. I just realized that I screwed up the Corndog link. I'm going to fix that now. I had something I wanted to say, but I totally forget what it was now.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      So, I fixed MIchael's changes to the template and deleted that useless Previous Posts thing.  However, I'm not sure it'll publish, because the stupid thing has said 19% for sometime now. Ok, it worked, but I still can't figure out why our sidebar migrates to the bottom.  It's quite annoying.  You invited all my friends!

      The new format's cool, but the links and cruft is all down at the bottom.... how'd that happen? oh, and when Im too lazy to find a web comic quote, Im using the random advertising slogan generator to come up with a title  You invited all my friends!

      Okay, I fixed the links and changed blog format. It took a long time, so my friends, if you want to change it back to the boring-ass format we had before, you can do that, we’re all administrators here. You can conquer the blog, like Charlemenge, but you better be prepared to fix the links aftwerwards and that takes frigging forever!    You invited all my friends!

      Marten, I'll fix your damn links when I get around to it. Blogger is awesome now, and since autistic people don't adjust well to change that's really big coming from me.  I would like to change the format. We're at 8 months. We're a blog in our prime, we're a prime blog.  Anyway, I really don't have anything to say. I sleep now. Not literally actually. It's more of a metaphorical sleep.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      I don't think I've ever made this much more sense than Erin, except maybe durring our arguement about whether or not a werewolf would change while she was pregnant.  LuckEdc: Can you melt down anvils? MysteriousBob87: probably MysteriousBob87: i mean, how else would you make one? LuckEdc: well... you could carve it... out of... iron... rocks. MysteriousBob87: ... MysteriousBob87: no. you cant. LuckEdc: why not? MysteriousBob87: because. iron rocks wouldnt be carved LuckEdc: but why? MysteriousBob87: if they were weak enough to be carved then you couldnt bang hot sheets of metal on them without messing up the anvil LuckEdc: well, that's just the problem, isn't it. because you bang HOT metal on the anvils and so they could'nt be melted down. so where are the anvils now? MysteriousBob87: the hot metal isnt melted metal MysteriousBob87: its just hot MysteriousBob87: ive got one in my garage actually LuckEdc: but it would make the anvil hot, so the anvil would melt. MysteriousBob87: no it wouldnt LuckEdc: maybe that's where they are. they're all in people's garages. MysteriousBob87: you cant melt an anvil with something that isnt hot enough to be melted itself LuckEdc: hmmm... LuckEdc: point: marten MysteriousBob87: w00t!  On a side note, Blogger is annoying now! I want my links back! screw profiles, if they want to know who I am they can read the Archives. I sound like triangle complaining at the cartoonist...

      We have a fansite! That's so cool! In other things, since there are like a dozen new schemes, in the spirit of "Change is Good", we should redesign Compendium. It'll be like that episode of The Simpsons with the Flaming Moe, and they change the bar style. We'll have a understated yet elegant monogram at the top of the page! Ha! Yeah, right. If we revamp with this crowd it's going to look like  urlLink Circus Circus . But it might eliminate the Italicization of Mass Destruction. Just an idea...  I'm extending an invitation to anyone at Compendium who is free on the 22nd of May (and who are not Erin or Thomas) and wants to go to a TWoPcon in Lafayette. It'll be fun!  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      I've officially decided to stop including people's names in this title scheme.  I am posting to say that we appear to have been  urlLink copied!  They want to make sure we aren't offended, so if anyone is, post and let me know.  Otherwise they officially have our okay.  Others of you are probably wondering who they are.  One is Nate's girlfriend.  The other two are not. Also: Resolving the "Wal" match-up. "today I'm setting up a big match involving a walrus, a walleye, a wallet, a walnut, a wall, Walt Disney, and Wally from DIlbert. The will battle it out at Wal-Mart. They may only use weapons purchased at Wal-Mart and have ten dollars to spend. I'm giving all inatimate object telekinesis with a three foot range that can't be used on people directly." I assumed the walrus ate the walleye right off.  Wally probably ate the walnut, telekinesis or none.  Walt Disney spent his 10 dollars on a pad of paper and a pencil, hoping to animate something vicious.  Unfortunately he stashed the money in the Wallet, which added it to it's own and used it to buy a sledge hammer, which it started hacking at the wall.  The wall collapsed on the wallet, killing it, and used it's telekinesis to hurl the sledge hammer at the Walrus, which was too big too dodge it.  Meanwhile, Disney used the little money he had to buy a fifty cent eraser, and erased Wally. He used Wally's money to buy a pen and paper and animated a wrecking ball to take out the wall.  Therefore, Walt Disney wins!   You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

      You're Thailand! Calmer and more staunchly independent than almost all those around you, you have a long history of rising above adversity.  Recent adversity has led to questions about your sexual promiscuity and the threat of disease, but you still manage to attract a number of tourists and admirers.  And despite any setbacks, you can really cook a good meal whenever it's called for.  Good enough to make people cry.  My book quiz was a tie, because my opinion of stream of consciousness depends on the context. Now, look: Isn't this second one creepy?  You're Ulysses! by James Joyce Most people are convinced that you don't make any sense, but compared to what else you could say, what you're saying now makes tons of sense. What people do understand about you is your vulgarity, which has convinced people that you are at once brilliant and repugnant. Meanwhile you are content to wander around aimlessly, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. What you see is vast, almost limitless, and brings you additional fame. When no one is looking, you dream of being a Greek folk hero.   You're The Mists of Avalon! by Marion Zimmer Bradley You're obsessed with Camelot in all its forms, from Arthurian legend to the Kennedy administration. Your favorite movie from childhood was "The Sword in the Stone". But more than tales of wizardry and Cuban missiles, you've focused on women. You know that they truly hold all the power. You always wished you could meet Jackie Kennedy.

      Or Things I'm Irrationally Pissed At: TV Edition!   ABC:  Thank You, ABC. Thank you for delivering a kick-ass episode of Alias last week. However making us wait two weeks for the finale? Not Cool. Airing 232 minutes of Harry fucking Potter? Not cool. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MOVIE IS 152 MINUTES LONG! I'm absolutely not seeing the next crap-ass installment of this crap-ass movie franchise. I'm thrilled it made Fametracker's inessential movie list. Go screw yourself, Rowling!   The Swan:  Because it's wrong. And they replaced Wonderfalls with reruns of this misogynistic crap disguised as entertainment. Hell, all FOX reality is misogynistic crap.  And I'm spent.

      Huh, Iceland.  It kinda makes sense, if you replace cold and forbidding with something else. Not sure what the best words would be...  Orchestra: We lost.  Okay, we got second place. But we should have got first.  And it's bugging me more than I thought it would.  I just came expecting to win and have it not really be a big thing, then when we didn't it's like, WTF mate?  And they called it runner up, too.  It's not second place, it's runner up.  It's like saying, "you were almost the best, but they beat you and you're losers."   But enough about that!  Afterward it was the best day ever! I left with Mowi and Celeste, and we went to weird Japanese stores with imported candy and stuff.  It was awesome! The weirdest stuff ever, it tastes great.  I found Shrimp flavored chips.  Then we went to Mowi's uber-awesome house and watched AKIRA.  It's freakin weird.  Don't ever watch it unless you really want to.  Food was great.

      I really am feeling good. It took every ounce of strength to get me through today, and I came home and checked Damn Hell Ass Kings, which led me to find out that there's a new Six Feet Under teaser trailer on HBO.com (Seriously, go check it out. It's the most awesome and bizarre thing of all time. If you haven't seen Peter Krause lip-sync "Feeling Good" by Nina Simone, you haven't seen Shakespeare the way it's meant to be seen.)  Speaking of that, I want to bring everyone (Paul, Rachel, Sophia) up to speed on Sports Night. With that in mind... Previously on Sports Night: Casey loved Dana. Dan liked Rebecca but got smacked down when she went back to her idiot husband. Dana had a brother that played in the NFL. Natalie and Jeremy hooked-up and had several annoying fights. Issac had a stroke. There was an audio recap/montage, and season one was over.  It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

      Well, its happened again.  Something very creepy and ironic has happened to me. Here I am sitting in the library of my mom's school, Mary Castle.  I'm sitting at a computer right next to a wall rsvping for Mighael's thing with pizza.  When I finish, I just happen to look to my left and what should I see taped to the wall 5 inches from my head?  A paper that explaning what a blog or weB LOG is.  Now is that just about the most creepy and ironic thing you've ever heard or what?!  I mean what are the chances of that?

I'll warn you, I'm gonna have toget at least 6 hours of sleep, no question.  State competition saturday. Paul:rsvping, pepperoni, and I'd like to know what and when I'm rsvping for.

Saturday we got a doggie!!!!!  Her name's Martie (short for Martini...at least that's what I say) and she's part doberman so she's colored like that...black and brown...and has a brown eye and a blue eye.  Isn't that awesome?!  She's the sweetest dog you'd ever meet, too.  Yay for doggies!  But then, after that, I SAW BEN FOLDS!!!!!!  OMG.  The only reason I'm telling you guys is because my TOD isn't working.  BUT HE WAS A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  I would have his children ANYDAY.  haha, sorry Marten.  :D  If you have never heard of Ben Folds you should wear the hat of shame.  He is God.

      There's only one question this week.   What would you like other people to say about you if you weren't there?   Michael : "He'll kill you. And then he'll go to work on you."  Jonah : "Nobody is as awesome as Jonah.  If there were an emperor of awesome, it would be he.  One time, I looked up awesome in the dictionary and saw his picture.  And not just any picture - an awesome picture.  It showed him being awesome by driving an awesome car into a pool of flaming sharks.  And that's what he does on his less awesome days.  Most of the time he's like 10 times as awesome as that."  Nathan "Wow, that Nathan, he sure isn't gay.  Not gay at all.  Totally un-gay.  So not gay, he's straight," (girls)'I'm happy" (guys) "Too bad"   Sophia "Yeah, she's a really great girl once you get to know her.  I promise, she's not always psychotic!"  Marten  "Cool. Original, but classic. That guy is even more awesome than Jonah." but the conversation is more likely to go like this: "what a loser." "shut up! he's cool" "isn't.""ass" the second person probably being Thomas. I think I took this one too far.  It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

Well the first one that I went to was the government. Or so I thought... It turns out that they had gotten and a policeman and a fireman to come to educate about two careers that I will go into when hell freezes over.  The only uplifting part is that the policeman whipped out his, I know what  you're thinking and your wrong, taser.  He turned it on briefly then tucked it back in it's holster. "I think we should liven thinks up a bit and ask the police officer to taser the fireman"-Michael.  Mercifully, that bit ended at the end of first session.  Little did I know the horrors that were waiting for me in the LGI Room.  At the time, I was relieved that we might actually learn something useful. After all, Performing Arts is sort of my thing.  So there we were, Carl Cote, Mark Yates. Then, to our horror, the women introduces herself as a "Landscapist." Naturally all three of us were like "WTF MATES?!" A general murmur of what the hell, this isn't art arose from the disquieted audience. Well she went on to explain that there was somewhat of a link between landscaping and art. I could sort of understand this, so I figured this must be the Art part of Performing Arts/Arts. We sat through her presentation politely, and eventually, it was time for the next speaker to come on. We figured that this would be a vocalist or some other sort of musician. We were dead wrong. I seem to recall her opening line as "I know that this clinic said performing arts, but I am going to stick to the regular art." Regular art?! HA! She was a fucking (excuse my language, but it is called for) interior designer. The crowd was shocked. A slow quiet came over the whole room as we realized that we were about to receize a 20 minute lecture on interior design. Luckily for us, we had Mark's digital camera and entertained ourselves by taking pictures of Carl's feet in various positions. Contact Mark Yates if you want copies. Don't get me wrong, we did try to leave, but my counselor decided at that moment to sell her soul to the devil and block our only exit. At the end, there was a time open for questions. The first was asked by Ghetto McGhettoson (name changed to protect the innocent). It was as follows: "What the hell? This isn't performing arts!  What instrument do ya'll play?" Then my demon-filled counselor made weak statements about the name saying bother performing arts and arts, and that they chose to focus on art. Art? Art my ass. Interior Designing does not cut it for a room full of people from the LC music department. My imp of a councelor ended up asking the vast majority of the questions. She is going to have to answer to the students, and it will not be a pretty site.  [Not a pretty site? Will it be webcast? --Michael]   Will I ever go willingly to another Career Day at LC? I think not. There will have to be some serious grade reduction to force me to go...  Anywho, on to Chicago. It was wonderful! We stayed at this nice hotel downtown called "Club Quarters." It had an awesome location, and everything was in walking distance. On Friday night, we went to the symphony and heard the Chamber Orchestra of Europe play "Midsummer's Night Dream" by Menddehlson, and quite a few selections from Bach. It was freaking awesome. At the beginning, their intonation was slightly off, but they really locked it in quickly and for the rest of the night. The applause at the end was humorous. The director, Andras Schiff, came back out like six times, and even had the symphony play an encore. Some of the members looked startled at the blast of applause even. Also, someone in the orchestra has the greatest name ever. "Nimrod."   On Saturday morning, we went to the Art Institute of Chicago to see the Rembrandt exhibit. It was good and everything, but it didn't really "touch me" as some would say. Not enough color, and too many faces. He seems like he was a really serious guy. I much prefer things like Van Gogh and Manet. After that, we drove home. I got to drive about 3/4 of the distance, which was great! Hurry for learners permits! Well, that about wraps up this post. Oh ya, I watched Blues Brothers recently, and my new explanation for everything I do is "We're on a mission from God" in that awesome Dan Akroyd Chicago accent. Oh by the way Erin, May is lusty? I didn't know that months had emotion and feelings!? Oh well, you learn something new everyday. Good Night! I sleep now!  -It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

      Thanks, Nathan. Apology accepted. And sorry for doubting you.  This weekend is just one big episode of seeing my family over and over and over again. Have been bored a lot.  Fanfiction Recommendation of the Week ("You might not care, but I do"): "Eye of the Storm" on fanfiction.net. It's about several OT Star Wars characters getting stuck on Earth. In the Star Wars universe it was in between ESB and ROTJ. On Earth it's the middle of convention season. Not as bad as most with that general setup as there are no fangirls. Quote: "I think I need my dosage checked. At the moment I'm in Colorado with my ex-husband and Luke Skywalker while Artoo Detoo serves iced tea and my son plays with a Princess of Alderaan in the kitchen." She gave a high-pitched, hysterical laugh. "So are really, really realistic hallucinations a common side effect of that new stress medication you put me on?"   It's May, it's May, the lusty month of May! :)  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

      I had a weird dream last night. There we're odd looking flying machines, like spaceships from an anime, or something, and I was hearing a radio news program explaining why they worked. Eventually, I drove one to pick up Sophia, who was trappied in Sophie's body, (Sophie was one of the four yearolds from vbs) and we had to try and find a way to get her out. Meanwhile, Sophie was still in her own body, and I kept losing track of Sophia, so I had to ask Sophie to let her say things. then I woke up in another dream, that I don't remember. Then I really woke up.   Supposedly, your subconcious knows everything, but i disagree. I think you notice somethings, and your subconcious only notices the rest. thats why dreams seem to mean something some times, but they're really just random and weird.   My birthday is tomorrow!   Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

      I think its been too long since I've posted.  A whole month of precious summer is almost gone, how can this be?  So far this has been an informative summer.  I've learned important life lessons such as, wearing shoes without socks hurts after a few days, staying up to watch late night T.V. results in very unproductive mornings, and eating nothing but Trix and pizza is bad for you in many ways.  Well, that is all.  Only 2 weeks until my birthday,  YAY!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

      I feel really  urlLink weird . As in not normal for me. I couldn't sleep friday night at the church thing, so I went to the multi-purpose room, put in one of my cds and danced. It had to look stupid to anyone not listening to the music. Oh well. It was 2 in the morning, and I couldn't sleep. It was the strangest thing I've done recently. I feel really strange.  Ouch!

      I'm back. Words cannot express how much I love Chicago. Or how much my feet hurt after a weekend in Chicago. But anyway, we took our dear cousin and her boyfriend up to Chicago for the weekend, and did stuff. We went to the Sears Tower, ate lunch at the Weber Grill, stayed at the Inter-Continental (again) and basically kicked it old school.  Also, in a sports related event (I know, I can hear you scrolling right now) Tim Henman (Awesome British Tennis Player) is on track to possibly win Wimbeldon (the Super Bowl of Tennis). And that would be really cool. But even if he does make it to the finals, he'd probably be beat by Andy Roddick (Awesome American Tennis Player). Okay, I'm done now.  Ouch!

      Eh, I definitely forgot what the name of our possible sitcom was going to be, but whatever.  I have a semi-major emergency.  I lost my phone.  My cell phone.  I feel so naked without it...I think I left it at the church.  So, if you guys are going tomorrow for church (which I guess you are) could you ask Patty if anyone found a blue cell phone?  I hope nobody stole it...although that'd be doubly awful seeing as I lost it in a church!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

      This is my first post in a while, and I intend to make it a good one. Or at very least a long one. We’ll see how it goes. Actually this post is pretty much going to be a White House Press Briefing.   -	It’s amazing that since Sophia quit, she’s said more on the outside than she ever did as a Blogger. Not that I don’t want her to come back, I’m just saying. -	Okay, Thomas made a hilarious gaffe today. It’s number five on the list of hilarious puns Hilarious Gaffes and Typos 1. “I hate him with the power of a thousand flaming nuns!” – Someone at TwoP 2. “I’m too busty to get a job!” – Jonah 3. “I’m feeding my dick!” – Ashley  4. “Red Roof Inns don’t have Colonial Breakfast!” – Thomas 5. "Is that a homo?" - Tim on seeing a homeless person in Chicago.  Okay, so I've seen The Terminal, which was good, and I saw Shrek 2, which was more jokes than story this time, so it was almost but not quite as good as the first. I was saddened to hear that Jonah is staying in Marching Band, although I'm happy that he got a kick-ass deal to do it.   I also, in the spirit of giving, have new stuff for everyone including myself. I got The Simpsons Season Four on DVD, and TiVo for my dad for fathers day, and Presents for pretty much everyone else (blog-wise anyway)  Also my Cousin (and her boyfriend) are in town, and we're showing them the "Best of Indiana", which is roughly equivelent to "The Most Mediocre of Anywhere Else." However, due to some odd reason, neither of them have seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies, so we're giving them a crash course in Tolkien while they're here. Just our gift to them.  Okay, it's 11:30 and I have swimming tomorrow, so I have to go bye-bye now. Bye, everyone!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

      Well, off I go to Florida tomorrow morning. I'll be back July 4th. By the time I get back, I wish for everyone to have RSVP'd to my King Arthur invitation. Yes or no? Which day? I'm going to be bored in Florida. You can read outside, but you can't write outside, and I'm going to get sunburned anyway, or return as pale as I am right now. I'll want to stay inside all the time, and my mom will make me go outside, and I'll be bored. And my brother will drive me crazy. In fact, by the time it's over, everybody in my family will be driving me crazy.  We still don't have our DSL back. I'm beginning to think it will be like the heat in Mr. Davis's room and we'll get it back only when we least expect it. In a few years. Sigh.

      Well, you know how we made it into the thrilling and tragic musical lair of the fairy people. Shut up Jonah, you ruined the whole thing.  Maybe we should give up on the word by word thing. Ha! Noffke rhymes with off key, there's another Jonah, and the Bishop gets set on fire! There's a giant moon, and the floor is red, like most everything else. It's all red, black and white. Come see the show. Hopefully our publicity manager won't get mad about this.    In other news, Eighteen four-year-olds.  'nuff said. Details in individual posts. You're mother is an aardvark, and your father smells of eldeberries. You can't mix quotes! Okay, don't say that. Jonah caved! He's still in marching band! Now before you get all upset, you should know that I didn't cave until I'd gotten pretty much everything I wanted.  I can miss half of each day of band camp, and all of the June rehearsals.  Also, they really need me back. No they don't, I've heard you play.something. The cat was on the skateboard, but I was unable to launch it. FIN!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

      Okay, so who wants to come see King Arthur with me? And do you want to see it on the 8th or the 9th? If it's on the 8th it will probably have to be in the evening, whereas on the 9th it can probably be in the afternoon.  Here is a fanfic rec for you all-- The Not Quite Love Letters, a SW fic on fanfiction.net. It's about Han and Leia and their relationship after the Battle of Yavin revealed through a few angsty journal entries, but mostly through official Alliance communications and random things like that. In the first chapter Han invites Leia to polish his medal. In the second chapter, computer terminals get thrown onto people's heads. It's really funny.   Ouch!

      Ok, so my sister's party wasn't dreadfully annoying, but it was pretty boring until most of her friends left. They tried to brake a piniata with a broken ruler. It wasn't even funny, it was just pitiful. I gave them half a pool cue to smite the paper mache pig.  Later on, I played cards with the last of the guests, people I actually knew from middleschool.  One of them turned out to be obscurely related to us. We've got another half cousin now.   It's Garage Sale Day! I've been looking for a TV, but everything is either too small, or doesn't have the right connection thingies for my ps2.  And the cost of some, geez. Some people don't understand the purpose of a garage sale. The point is to get rid of stuff, not to make a whole lot of money. It's pocket change, most likely going to be spent on the equally cheap merchandise of others. Some people got the idea, though, like the person from whom I bought a sega genesis. one dollar. It was fate. There was the machine, and there was a dollar in my pocket. Now I just have to find some games, another controller, and the wires I need to plug it in.

      Thanks to everybody who told me it was ok. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy that you actually took time to say it. :) Plus, it turns out you were right. I apparently, I just have a slightly large, but fully functioning and cyst-free thyroid. So yay! Also, I don't have TB. It's all good news here.  Sophia, you've made me sad. Come on, my life is pretty boring too, I just talk about it anyway. I mean, let's look at this objectively: my last post was about Discworld books and my thyroid. Please.  Anyway, my dad says that if our DSL isn't up very soon we're getting cable internet, just to spite the dsl people. But that would be super inconvenient really, because in order to afford it we'd have to get rid of AOL, and I've already filled out all my college stuff with my AOL account, and we'd have to download AIM and everything. That's bad.  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

      There should be a JournalCon of some kind this weekend, starting sometime before 6 on friday.  Mostly so I can get out of a house full of middleschool girls. Yes, it's my sisters birthday party, and it's planning on being loud and annoying. Some one with a big house, save me! We could make it Sophia's going away JournalCon, despite the fact that she'll still come to other journalcons. Or maybe it could be a Sophia's not really leaving JournalCon. C'mon, sometimes you have something to say. Thomas doesn't post frequently, and niether do I anymore. Just post when something interesting happens to you, or when you happen to something interesting. Once you're gone, you'll have something you wanted to post. Please stay with us?  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

      Hey all.  Look, I'm really sorry about this, but I don't think I'm gonna be a blogger anymore. I'm not about to lie and tell you that I don't have enough time because, hello, it's summer, but I just don't have anything to say.  You shouldn't miss me too much seeing as I don't say anything anyway.  I'd still love to journalcon with you guys though (yes, now it's a verb).  It's not you, it's me.  ;)  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

      So I quit marching band.  Definitely, for sure, I am not participating in this, the 2004 season of the LNHS season.  Absolutely for certian. Except that I might not.  See, my reason for quitting was of course Jekyll and Hyde, but Mr. Noffke doesn't want me to take two consecutive weeks off (Triennium and Newspaper camp) and I can't quit those, since my parents have already put down about $300 for each.  If I'm out of Jekyll and Hyde for that, I might as well do Marching Band.  EDIT: Noffke's gonna let me get do it, so I guess I am quitting.  But if I miss one day, I'm out.   Also, Nathan and I started building a boat today.  It also started flooding.  Amazingly enough, these two things are not related. Inspired by an episode of Biography on A&E last night, Nathan and I have officially made our college plans.  We're going to NYU to study acting, just like the Olsen twins.  In fact, they'll still be there, so we're planning to either marry them or collaborate on an award-winning sitcom, or both.  With the acting genius of Nathan and I and the star power of MK & Ashley, we'll be rich.  It's fool-proof. (My title is the prospective title of the show or an associated autobiography). Also, that's the new "We should get married... to other people." Now it's "We should get married... to the Olsen twins." In conclusion, the boredom of the summer is almost certianly getting to us.   I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

      Yesterday I purchased The Wee Free Men. I am now reading it. And when I'm done that will leave only The Last Hero that I haven't read, not counting A Hat Full of Sky, which I don't think is out this side of the pond yet. And, just as a heads up, the next DW book will be called Going Postal and it's coming out in October or November. It's about the postal system and golems. That's all I've been able to get. I think it's another misc. with cameos, like Monstrous Regiment was.  I have now listened to the Two Towers tapes, and if you want a few highlights, check out my journal. If you don't have its address, just let me know and I'll email it to you, since I don't think blogger will let me put the link up here.   Yesterday I went to the doctor to get vaccinated so that I can go to college. So I got a meningitis vaccine and a TB test. Yay. Then it turns out I have an enlarged thyroid gland, and I don't really know what that means, but they had to draw blood to test. I've never had that done before; it was kinda creepy. Then I have to go in again tomorrow so they can ultrasound my neck, I guess, and try to figure out why my thyroid is enlarged. I'm a little worried about it, I can tell you... Well, anyway. Just thought I'd put that out there so everybody can say, "Don't be worried, Erin, it's okay."   Later.  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

      Someone should make a fun BMV.  Something like Dr. Jones's Orthodontist's office.  Put an arcade in there, a really good snack bar (or at least some vending machines), Public internet terminals and a play area for the kids.  Imagine the difference if instead of "Now I have to go back to the BMV..." It was "Now we get to go back to the BMV!! I'm so excited!" Seriously is there some goverment rule that says BMV's have to be drab and dreary?  Everyone hates going there so much and it's something that wouldn't be hard to do. In case you haven't figured it out, I got my permit today.  In fact that's all I did, since it took me, all in all, about six hours.  Yeah. After that we drove around the parking lot, where I concluded that driving is not nearly as easy as it looks. And on the way home we listened to a tribute to Ray Charles, including his unique version of the song "Imagine": "Imagine all the people (All the little people)  Living... Living there whole lives.. just for today..." What a guy.  Well that's all I have to say.  Oh, also Micheal, could you link me to your West Wing script site cause I'm lazy? Thanks.

Thanks a lot, Patty. Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! "Haec credam a Patty pio? A Patty iusto? A Patty scito? Cruciatus in crucem! Tuus in terra servus nuntius fui officium perfeci. Cruciatus in crucem. Eas in crucem!"  Okay, now that I'm done irrationally railing at Patty, I'm on to other matters.

      I went shopping yesterday. It's something I don't often do, but my mom decided we need new clothes. I guess I do, I've only got one pair of shorts. So now we're $300 dollars in the hole, but I have 2 new pairs of shorts and Lounge Pants! I was stuck between two pairs, one covered with smileys and a pair of mario-print pants. The extreme yellow and the power of smileys was tough to pass up, but the sheer novelty of Mario won me over. I get my license now!    Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?

      Okay, I'm reformatting the template, because it's über-annoying in its current format.  Okay, I haven't posted since Saturday and I think it's time to throw my two cents in on Gym. I hate it. It is awful. If I had to pick between Gym Class or death, I would probably pick death, because unlike Gym, Death is quiet, peaceful and probably doesn't smell like a great big armpit. There are several things I hate about Gym, and four of them are teachers. There are six teachers teaching Gym Class. It takes them the better part of an hour to take attendence. When we transition from one place to another almost none of the students know what's going on because none of the teachers know what's going on and that is because there are six of them. There's Mr. Holman, Mrs. Annee, Mrs. Fuson, and three LN teachers I don't know. One of them looks like Mr. Harvey with dark hair and a buzzcut, the others look old. And the teachers don't like each other. One of the old LN teachers told me to take my Tardy Pass to "Mrs. Hag" née Mrs. Fuson. Mr. Holman refered to her as the Gestapo. And both of them were right, because Fuson is what you would get if Aileen Wuornos and Joan Collins had a baby together. She's bitchy, she's ill-tempered, she's always yelling about something and I'm pretty sure she was hungover this morning. We did swim testing yesterday, and we swam about eight different times because the teachers were incompetant. Then we went and ran on the track and played optional Basketball. So I dribbled for about ten minutes and sat on the bleachers until we got dressed. I've just been wearing my gym clothes to school because of three things: number one, I always have it with me, Number two, I'm not getting dressed up for these people and number three, I'm inevitably going to get sweaty and I will pick the shower in my house over the shower at school everytime, so I'm not going to get new clothes all icky and sweaty. Of course, everyday people have asked me questions like "Why are you wearing your gym suit? We just changed." From now on, I'm answering "None of your damn business." Just because I can. One kid who is one of those kids who thinks he's cool, but is just a ass, made a snide comment, which I just ignored because he's ugly, fat, gay and a general asshole. To sum it up: Gym = Bad.  Okay, on to lighter subjects, I'm having "LotRCon II: Forth Eorlingas!" at my house on Friday at 4:30. So far I have Jonah, Nathan and Claire coming. More are welcome. RSVP in the comments section.  "Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?" "No, it's my cookie."

      For those of you not privy to the conversation, I have officially decided to name my daughter, should i ever have one, Starfish.  It's a great name, with many cool nicknames - Star, Starry, Fish, Fishy, Starfy, Arfish.  She will probably not sport a cornfrohawk, but you just never know. Which brings me to other news: I am getting a haircut today.  I am going to pay some person money to cut off my hair.  Barbering is one of the few industries where we pay people to take things away.  Also banking, but the difference is that there is an understanding that the bank will give you your money back someday, whereas the barbershop would never in a million years return your hair. Another such business is daycare, but this is also temporary, and usually much shorter term than the bank.  So, in conclusion - You pay daycare to take your kids for a day, The bank to take your money for some years, and the barbershop to take your hair FOREVER.  Luckily hair grows back, and is an infinitely renewable resource, unless you are Homer Simpson or Captian Picard. Has everybody heard of the Wikipedia?  The ultimate experiment in anarchy - anyone can update a page with new info.  You could. I could.  Gary Coleman could.  Gary Coleman is, by the way, in a new musical called Avenue Q which just won a lot of Tonys.  It's about homosexuality and rascism and muppets, and Gary Coleman is played by a woman.   Anyway, if I ever had a topic to get off it I lost it a long time ago.    Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.

      I'm smart!  Or, at least, smarter than I thought I was. Report cards came today.  I got straight A's for term six, and only two B's and one C cumulatively.  Because of the weight, I actually had a 4.048 for term six, which really helped drag my cumulative GPA out of the gutter(Yes, I consider a 3.3 to be the gutter.  I can do better).  It will make my parents very happy, which should in turn make me very happy.  It's nice to be back on track. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.

      The Happy Fun Hanover Weekend went over basically without a hitch. Sometimes, though, when I'm with my grandparents and my Aunt Barbara and my mom, I really wish I had a tape recorder. Some of this stuff, you just can't make it up. I could have sworn we were going to get arrested for breaking and entering.  I saw "Troy" yesterday. It's an interesting movie. Brad Pitt was very pretty. Orlando Bloom was funny as Paris because he was such a big wimp. And he did a lot of Legolas bow-and-arrow stuff and a lot of Will Turner sword stuff. I loved Hector and I was sad when he died. We cheered three times. The first was for the King Arthur trailer, which was awesome. The second time was when Rose Byrne (Dormé from AOTC), who played Briseis, stabbed Agamemnon in the neck. It must have been the handmaiden training. The third was when Aeneas got a little cameo. But they did so many things wrong in that movie. For example, the Trojan War was supposed to be nine years long, and in the movie it was about 16 days. And that's counting the twelve-day timeout for Hector's funeral. There's lots more, but my friend Alicia is writing a review of it,a and I get to comment upon it, so I will probably be more coherent after that.   I now own three more Discworld books! I have Small Gods, Hogfather, and The Fifth Elephant. The only books in the main series that I don't have now are Reaper Man and Thief of Time. I'm most excited about having Fifth Elephant because that was the second DW book I read and I can't remember what happens. I looked through all the Carrot and Angua parts last night, and they are really so touching when you know Carrot and Angua. He goes after her. He almost says he loves her. He holds her hand. He promises to kill her if he ever needs to. She cries. She gets called a dog. She fights her family. She says, "Carrot's mine." I love that couple. They're so screwed up.    Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.

      Okay, first things first, JournalCon was both great and a disaster as Jonah fell asleep like a Jonah. Thomas and I stayed up and debated policy initatives and Old-School Nickolodeon Shows until one.  Building a playground was fun even with the presence of butt-guy.  Levi's open house was entertaining, I compared Levi to a "drunk woman who shakes her breasts." Somehow Kafkaesque got in there. Levi and Colin did the duo and it was good. Leeches are funny.  However, I was greatly entertained by a picture of a certain blog founder in third grade. I'm working with the Comstocks to get that picture online. I wanted to see other yearbooks, but all that Jonah found was the Everyman edition of The Canterbury Tales, there was a bare-chested woman on the cover. Needless to say, I coined the term "The Canter-booby Tales." So, yeah... And then I asked again to see a yearbook and Jonah presented me "The Case Against Spanking".   Very Entertaining Day. More Later. I love you, so much. Your Daughter, Claudia. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.

      I discovered my old love of swinging again last night! When we build that playground on Saturday, The Patty better let us play on it at youth group. Because playgrounds are awesome.  This is my new feature. I'm calling it...  "A Proportional Response"  Erin: Dorm room stuff?  urlLink IKEA ! Nathan: Does the word "Homonym" mean anything to you?

      It's weird.  I figured when summer came, I'd have a lot of time to post.  And I due.  Trouble is, now I've got nothing to post about. (I know "about which to post" would be right but it sounds kinda akward, doesn't it?) Bottom line: Stuff stops happening, I stop having stuff to say. Last night I wrote a parody that almost no one will get.  You have to be a fan of both REO Speedwagon and Pokemon.  If any of you want to hear it, I'll post it. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

      Hurray! Everything's cool now! I'm sure I had something to post, but I can't remember what it was anymore. Oh, yes. I graduated. Thanks to those of you who could come to my house. I am now faced with the depressing reality that I have a buttload of money and I'm going to have to spend most of it on dorm room stuff. Oh, well. The other night I went bowling with Toni and Huevos. After I found the picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi in my purse (don't ask why, just accept) we decided to use the Force and bowl with our eyes closed. Toni and I were much better at it than Huevos, but that was probably just because he decided to use the dark side. Toni and I put on padawan braids and we changed our names on the score screen to slightly SW-ish things. I love being a big huge dork.

      Why are you wearing tights?   Thomas, it was for conversational purposes.

      Marten, I'm sorry I said that. It was wrong and mean, and I absolutely want to blog with you again. Once Again, I'm sorry.  Okay, resume general blogging  Random Thoughts * While the new description is funny, it isn't true as at this very moment, I am wearing tights. * Everyone coming on Friday needs to bring sodas to share with everyone. * People should start referring to the police as "the fuzz" again  I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

      Marten, you've got admin power back.  If you want to use it to quit again, so be it.  I'd rather we all just forget this nonsense and get back to blogging.  Erin has been the most sensible so far.  These issues are between Michael and Marten, and I would prefer they find another way to fight it out without screwing up the blog for the rest of us.  BTW, who wrote the new description?  I like it. Anyway, it occurred to me that a bunch of blog-worthy stuff has happened to me lately that I haven't written because of the nonsense.  For instance, all the tornados on Sunday.  We were in the basement for around two hours ,[Ha! I was in a leaky fallout shelter for about half an hour. It would be nifty if I wasn't pissed about still being there-Marten]  and they came right over us.  Luckily none of them touched down, but we were pretty worried.  It got to the point where we were stashing our valuables in the basement.  Then on Monday, following a note from my grandma's mother, we found her grandfather's grave.  For those of you not keeping track, that's my grandma's great grandfather or my great great great grandfather, Jacob Tanner Snyder, who fought in the civil war.  Not thrity feet from his grave is that of Richard Gattling, inventor of the first automatic weapon - the gattling gun.  And less than a mile away is our shortest running president, William Henry Harrison. So that was pretty cool.  It's not every day you track down a 150 year old relative.

      Okay, I left the first time because I was having a bad day, and didn't particularly like the way the blog was working.  I was convinced that people wanted me back. So I accept the invite from michael, and he accuses me of folding. Thats exactly why I hadn't already come back! If I leave and come back, you're just going to make annoying comments about it. Cuz thats what you do. You're the Michael Christie of making annoying comments. So I always have to watch what I write so I don't write anything you can make an annoying assnark comment on. Well, I'm sick of it michael. I'm tired of standing up for someone who kicks me in the back of the knees so I fall back down.

      Okay, I've had it. For 45 minutes I was fired from this blog by Marten because he is being petty, immature and a general ass. His new description was this: "This is for Michael: Continuing to be an ass isn't going to help you any. My patience runs thin and I'm running on hypocracy. Therefore, I can be an ass, and you cannot. Do not push me."   Marten, I'm not speaking to you anymore. Just because you think you are "Marten the Great" or the "Pirate King" doesn't mean that you are. Also the fact is you left. You're no longer the "leader". You can't claim that title  because you left . I'm dropping it as of now, so if BlogWar II: Electric Boogaloo drags on any longer, ladies and gentlemen of the blog, I believe that you will know who is responsible.

      Here's how it works.  I'm not being a jerk here, just trying to sort things out.  Marten and Michael are both flagrantly abusing their admin powers because they're mad at each other, because this is childish and immature, I'm taking away said powers.  Do I really have that power? No.  So if any of you think I've judged in error and give the powers back, I will except that I was wrong and let it stand.  If you guys agree with me, then leave their powers off.  I'm not mad at you guys, but when we made the "Everybody's an admin" rule it was not so you could be petty and immature.  And I don't care who started it.   I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

      I'm back, sorry for any confusion I caused. I was just having a bad day and acted rashly. Michael: If you chose to be an asshole, fine. I offer no further apology. Everyone else, I think it's good to be back, if it really was pointless, then I'll leave again.  I think I don't know I think I know I don't think I know I think I don't think I know I think....

      a "fringe" environmentalist."   Hey! Guess what! What should have been a rapid descent into hell wasn't! National Parks have got their stuff together and have phones and some have free internet access and they're awesome!  Right now I am in Zion. It's actually 2:44 PM, because of Mountain time, but even though I don't like nature or heat or bugs, I am actually enjoying Utah. Beaver Creek already kicked ass and took names and I have exactly two minutes left so I'm wrapping this up.   I may get on tomorrow, I may not. I barely got on today, because a lady who must have been the Brazilian equivalent of Ann Landers took forever checking her e-mail.  And I'm spent...  Haha, tricked you, I'm a hippie.

      So I'm back, at long last.  It's been two weeks like you wouldn't believe.  I met a girl named Blithe and one named Virdi, for those of you into weird girl names.  Also a guy named Jonars.  In the past week I've been working on Rat, the magazine for mall rats.  20 pages, three people, one week.  I have it as a pdf, and if anyone knows how I could upload it to the internet, that would be awesome, because then you could all see it.  Triennium, as Nathan said, was phenomenally awesome.  Words cannot describe.  There was a Wizard of Oz event that was like a Journalcon on crack.  Not only did we quote and snark, but there were Rocky Horror Picture Show-esque interactivities.  Thomas, Nathan, and I, as flying monkeys, waited until the witch said "Fly, Fly, Fly!" then ran around the audience in masks, fezes, and wings screaming, whooping and jumping. It was crazy fun.  A girl in my small group broke my slinky, so we cut off the broken part.  The girl (Maria) turned it into a bracelet, so now I have a half-slinky, and I can tell people truthfully that the rest of my slinky is on some girl's wrist in California.  If that's not awesome, I don't know what is.  Anyway, that's all I have to say, also that I'm gonna update Corndog really soon.

      Standing Stone was okay, but Triennium would have been better. I keep forgetting I'm the weird one. Mostly walking to and from the dam, to and from the rec hall, and playing cards, or video games when my cousins ditched me from time to time. It wasn't in a mean way, they just never made an effort to find me before they went and did stuff, and when I found them later in the day, they're all "Where've you been?" In my freaking cabin, if you cared to look. sheesh. oh well. Some are coming to Jekyll and Hyde.  Haha, tricked you, I'm a hippie.

      I am back from Triennium.&nbsp; I have no idea what to say about it in this post.&nbsp; Thomas, Jonah and I formed a Harmonica, Didjeridoo (sp?), Water Bottle praise band called Slippery When Wet.&nbsp; ummm.... Boycott Taco Bell.&nbsp; Pittsburgh with an H, or Pittsburg without an H?&nbsp; Say 'Bagel'.&nbsp; Fly, Fly, FLY!!!!!! TWENTY THREE GUITAR SOLOS!&nbsp; The Band.&nbsp; Sumo Wrestling.&nbsp; Global Partner Kickline.&nbsp; Jesse of the pink hair.&nbsp; Blithe, Darby, and Jazzimine.&nbsp; Starship Tiderious!&nbsp; Carry your Sandal....  Ok that made no sense to anyone but Thomas and Jonah, but I can't begin to describe everything that happened.&nbsp; Suffice it to say it was really weird, but really fun.&nbsp; Except maybe for the guitar solos.  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

      Hello! I didn't think I'd be posting, but I am! Because the Residence Inn is Awesome, and I love it even though the location sucks.  Denver has been fun. It sounds lame, but that's exactly what it has been. Fun. I'm running out of computer time, so full details will be posted later, possibly in Zion.   Bye! See y'all in August!

      Hey, guys! I wish you weren't all gone. I'm sad and lonely.  Guess what? Comstocks, if you're being INSANELY spoiler-free, turn away. The&nbsp;official title of Episode III is Revenge of the Sith. Just as&nbsp;anybody could have guessed in 1983. Except us, I guess,&nbsp;'cause we weren't born. But although it's an obvious choice, it's obvious because it's good. Certainly better than a title like "Attack of the Clones." So the sequence of movies (in movietime chronology): The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi. Hee. Little things like this give me such pleasure.  Marten and I have communication difficulties in talking about the movies, because he insists on referring to realtime chronology, and I keep referring to movietime. So I'll say Luke looks like Anakin in that shot, and he says no, Anakin looks like Luke. It's frustrating. Almost like the werewolf thing.  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

      Well, the TiVo is set, the mail is stopped, the dog is in the kennel and the Christies are going on vacation once again. This time, we’re setting off for the west, metaphorically wagon-train-ing to Las Vegas with about a million stops along the way. It’ll be just like the pioneers, except with motels and a car with XM Satellite Radio and DVD Entertainment System. Our stops will be made in Denver, Beaver Creek/Vail, Grand Junction, Moab (Arches National Park), Bryce  Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, The Grand Canyon (North Rim) and finally ending our trip at the fabulous Paris Las Vegas Resort & Casino. It actually looks to be a great trip, even with the cumulative week spent in National Park Lodging. Because EW! I might be Audioblogging a bit from these locations, which will be fun because I’ve wanted to try that out for a while now and now I have an excuse. After my return, I plan to post a short day-by-day recaplet piece at What Kind of Day Has It Been, which I will then continue to blog on a weekly basis. Cheerio!  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

      I HATE OLD PEOPLE!  Our neighbors are out of town and we have been given permission to use their pool. That's cool, no? Well it would be except the neighbor also gave permission to her mother to have a widow support church group thing. They were supposed to be gone by 7. They also brought a niece (I neded to mention that sometime)  They just WON'T LEAVE!  They're "waiting for the niece's mom to come." And she's late and she's really pissing me off. I wanted a nice swim today. Instead I got a bunch of old people swimming in the pool that is rightfully ours, since they had it until 7 and it is presently 8:18.  I hate old people.

      You have no idea how weird I'm feeling right now.&nbsp;  It's 6:30 in the evening and dinner is on the table, but to me it feels like morning, because I just got up, having gone to bed&nbsp;3 hours previously.&nbsp; I don't take naps; this is why.&nbsp; My sleep schedule is gonna be off for a week.&nbsp; Anyway, they want me down at the dinner table, but to me it's breakfast, and it's way to early for me to be able to handle it. Ok, I've had a shower I'm a little better now.&nbsp; We just saw Seussical! and one of the characters was so Thomas it was funny.&nbsp; Thomas, you are now Horton the Elephant. Then we&nbsp;played DnD until until the wee hours of the night.&nbsp; I was a drunken mad dwarf.&nbsp; It was fun. Then I got carwashed.&nbsp; ANd cars got washed by me, and so did the dog only not really.&nbsp; Ok, more sleep now.&nbsp; Adios!

      Right now I am at Paul's house, where we are midway thorough a Super Smash Brothers battle royale. Carl is sitting next to me playing MoH: Rising Sun multiplayer by himself. I'm Michael Christie, and this is the longest birthday party of my life.   I'm posting about my really really awesome great day. Because the Christie family has traded in their beaten old sport utility vehicle for...a brand new version of the same vehicle. But it has bucket seats in the back, XM satellite radio and DVD Entertainment for the back seat. I love the car, it is almost as good as an Armada. I'd write an ode to the Tahoe Z71, but this is the slowest internet connection ever, so I can't just run over to RhymeZone.com to find a thing.   Also today was the last day of summer gym, in which I got a B, because I cannot serve a volleyball, shoot a free throw, shoot a layup, run either a mile, 100 meters, 400 meters or two consecutive laps without vomiting all over the track. In fact the warmup almost killed me.   I have nothing to say about finishing gym other than:    Freedom is  mine !   And  I  know   how  I  feel ...   It's  a  new dawn .   It's  a  new day .   It's  a  new life ...for me.   And   I'm   feeling   good .    Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

      Eh, that's as good a title as any!  Did you hear the Canadian slipping in there?&nbsp; That's courtesy of my awesome cousins and aunt, who are here at my house for a while.&nbsp; We have been out doing things and stuff for a while now.&nbsp; We hit the Children's Museum (the  DINOSAUR  exhibit is very cool) RAWR!, the bowling alley (bowled a  77   ), the arcade for some    D  D  R  , and of course, K-mart.&nbsp; In case you haven't noticed, I'm     A  B  U  S  I  N  G   C  O  L  O  U  R!!!!!   (note the U, very Canadian).&nbsp; The reason for this is that I am  VERY TIRED!!!!!  For instance, I can't tell my rights from writes. Or wrongs or lefts or something.&nbsp; Anyway, this knew (I mean new) template line is a great one from scarlet Letter.  So Evelyn (wings) is right next to me now, and she wants this to be known, despite the fact that that means all her potential internet stalkers will know EXACTLY WHERE SHE IS.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm gonna let her type for a short spell.  I have no idea what to right, so I'll (oops, I'm doing it too.&nbsp; Too much cousin bonding time methinks) just tell you all to go read my blog which I'll be updating more frequently since my mom knows about it now and I won't have to hide from her when I post.&nbsp; I'm planning a    "Surviving the Comstocks: Into the heart of Indianapolis's Insane community"    for my upcoming blogs, so stay tuned.   Anyway, I don't have so much more to say right now, so I'm gonna rap up this entry. Darn, well to save face, I'll actually rap up this entry.  (Beatboxing) The entry is over  I typed the last word  So stop reading now  Or I'll flip you the bird  Word.&nbsp;  (Addendum: How the heck does the Blogger spell check not know the word&nbsp;"blog"????? I mean, seriously!)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

      Thanks a lot, Erin. Not only have you bailed on me (for the second time), you did it after I went to fucking Glendale to see King Arthur. A pox upon you!

      Guess what?! Guess! Are you done guessing? Okay, I'll tell you now.  Yesterday I posted my Velma Kelly story-- Marten's read it but I don't think any of the rest of you have yet-- on fanfiction.net and it's been REVIEWED TWICE ALREADY! And the reviews are good! Really good! I'm so happy and excited about it! If any of you are interested, it's called "Closing Night" and it's a "Chicago" fic, which is under movies.  Also, I know the name of my roommate for next year. Her name is Katy Holmes. I haven't contacted her yet, because I'm not sure what to say. I need to think about it a bit. But it's weird, because for some reason I had this odd premonition that her name would be Katy. Spelled like that and everything. Hmm.   I am made of POISON!

      My cousins are here.  It's fun, even if they are a little normal sometimes.  They make up for it by being from Canada, where Carwashes are apparently illegal.  I swear if we could harness the endless energy of ten year olds we wouldn't need cold fusion.  But I'll survive. In other news, we had a Jekyll and Hyde blocking rehearsal today.  I'm a pickpocket and  I GET PROSTITUTES!   I know I'm a little too excited about it, but you have to remember I  was  the girl last time.  It's nice to have hot ones hanging on me. (Don't worry, Ash, you're still my #1 girl) Also, Rachel, you might be interested to know that Brad just got upgraded from 2 or 3 lines to one of the three largest parts in the show.

      I'm back, too. I'm tired. I'm glad Thomas isn't dead. We thought he might be, and "golf" was just his parents in denial. Michigan was fun, I think we should do three days instead of two more often. It feels considerably longer, though. It was the first time in a while that we had to set up in the dark. On saturday I spent the day with a drama troupe, met some interesting people. It was kinda spooky, how similar they were to our group. They even had the same idea of combining bagels and muffins, as well as a few other inside jokes at least half of you guys know about. If we can ever get clothes for you guys, I think it would be fun to start a drama group. It would be part of my plan to revive vaudeville! We could sing and do tricks as well as act, it would be great.    I am made of POISON!

      Thanks to everybody who came out for me to see King Arthur. For my official review of it, you can go to my LJ.   Really, I was just looking for an excuse to use that line as a post title.  I wish I could think of something else to say. I really can't.  Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

      Have you ever lied for absolutely no reason?  I mean, I was talking to someone today, and I just... lied.  Totally inexplicably.  I didn't even think about it at all.  A total fabrication just escaped my lips.  It couldn't in any concievable way have helped me, but it could hurt me in many ways.  Immediately afterwards, I regretted it, but then there was nothing I could do, and nw I feel all guilty.  But what do I do now?  Just say, 'sorry, that wasn't really true?'  I mean I can't apologize if I didn't have any reason.  And why did I do it?  Was it something subconscious?  Whatever it was, it's freaking me out majorly.  Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

      I've got my driver's license! I'm a licensed driver! Now all I need is a job to pay for insurance and 3 months so I can drive with passengers and I'm set!  This spaghetti would taste a lot better with grated cheese. hey, I was being literal there, but that would be a good template! or maybe not... I'm done!

      Okay, I know, the site is black now. I did it, okay, I am Spartacus.  (The Haikus are mine, though - Jonah)  It's the same thing as before except black. For those of you reading the site feed. It's really quite lovely, you should check it out.  Okay, I know no one is reading the site feed. Okay, this is diluting my message. Not that I actually had one. I just kind of...lost it.  I'll find it in a while.  Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

      So it's 10 am and I just woke up so I'm all like "I'm gonna post on the blog, except that I have nothing really to say but I'll make up for it with my wit and charm or something" Well, I do have a few things.  For instance, everyone should know about  urlLink "Rock, Paper, Saddam"   Also, I would encourage you to all go see Fahrenheit 911.  It's a good movie. I went to a party last night.  The most interesting thing was probably the attempt to cut a watermelon with a bread knife. We ended up cutting a weird, jagged elipse around the melon, and then scooping out the insides with an ice-cream scoop and eating it with spoons. Also, if you haven't seen  urlLink tailsteak.tk  before, the Tournament of Things is just starting. To conclude, for Evelyn, I'm starting a Canadian COuntdown: 3 1/4 Days!

      There. I'm home now. Florida was all right, although I was sick part of the time, which sucked. I don't really want to talk about that. I did get to so some cool stuff at Universal, and swim in the Gulf, and we stopped and saw this really awesome Titanic exhibit. If anyone's ever passing though the Orlando area, I encourage them to go find it. It's called Ship of Dreams, and you get to go inside reproductions of some of the rooms on board, and then you stand outside on the deck, and it's really cold... Their attention to detail is amazing. It was a really moving thing to go through, especially for me, as I was a pretty huge Titanic buff for a while there until I'd learned pretty much everything. After we left I played the soundtrack to Titanic the Musical in the car. That's a good musical. You know. "No moon, no wind/ Nothing to spy things by/ No wave, no swell/ No line where sea meets sky/ Stillness, darkness/ Can't see a thing, says I/ No reflection, not a shadow/ Not a glint of light meets the eye/ And we go sailing, sailing/ Ever westward on the sea/ We go sailing, sailing/ Ever on go we..." This is material perhaps better suited to my lj. I'll talk about it there later.   Marten, sorry I wasn't here for your birthday. Happy birthday!

      Well, Claire decided that I was beneath her and not worth her considerable time and pre-emptively attacked our plan of potentially dating. I guess it was because Jonah just made a much more comfortable body pillow. Actually, I really don't care, because Claire is the flakiest most non-committal person I know, and I know a lot of flaky non-committal people.  Okay, moving on to happier things: I! HAVE! TiVo! I'm so happy, I'm just TiVoing everything I can. I've got the British House of Commons on there tomorrow night. I've TiVoed  The Daily Show for the last couple of days and it's been great to come home from summer school and watch Jon Stewart and some really funny people do the news.  Okay, I am tired now. This template's gotta go. Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

      Today is infinite improbability day! When nothing goes as expected.  It started this morning at the Wimbleton Womens finals when 13th seeded  urlLink Maria Sharapova  beat first seeded Serena Williams.  (In related news, I'm dumping Janel Moloney.  Maria's closer to my age anyway.)  Also unusual, Nathan watching an two entire sporting events ( I also watched Roddick vs Ancic).  Tennis is severely underated.   After that I successfully made an egg that wasn't scrambled.  A little while later we played hearts. Jonah and I each shot the moon, and I wasn't even trying to till I was nearly there.  Jonah got incredibly lucky at all points in the game.  After that we heard thnat the general assembly gay and lesbian ordination motion only failed by four votes, which is probably the most amazing thing.  Then we went outside and got caught in a terrible freak rainstorm.  Lots of weird stuff keeps happening.  It'll be worse by the end of the day, mark my words   Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

      Okay, I'm back. And I've got a plan. It's a good plan. It's a plan for JournalCons. (I'm going to say this and then be done until they actually happen, so don't freak out, Marten...)  October - AngelsInAmericaCon  January - WonderfallCon March - Monty Py-Con  May - FamilyGuyCon  Yes, you read that right. I'm devoting an entire con to the British Comedy stylings of Monty Python since neither Movie nor MusicalCons panned out. Enjoy! (Technically there already was a MusicalCon, I just wasn't there. I'm just sayin...)  Also Marten, I so want to see the cornrow pictures.  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

      lol geesh, what kind of a band would this be?  Their songs would be all haikus.  Haha.  I would laugh.  Anyway, I am laughing.  :D  But....MY HAIR IS LONG(er)!  I HAVE TEETH!  I told you that, right?  I got my braces off?  I don't remember if I announced that to you or if that was after I "quit".  Who knows, eh?  Ooo!  I'm going to start saying "no?" at the end of sentences.  Sounds good, no?  See?  Doesn't that sound so foreign?!  Okay, sorry, I'm a bit hyper and have a lack of places to express my hyperosity.  Plus I'm putting off reading The Scarlet Letter.  I hate that book.  GRRRRR.  :D   There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

      Hey, guys, since none of you are ever online due to your various commitments, I'm going to ask you this question in the form of a survey, to which you may respond by emailing me. For those of you who have read Night Watch-- I just reread it, and I'm wondering:  (two things now, actually, one of which is why this stupid thing won't let me press the "enter" button) Was Lady Roberta Messerole of Genua, aka "Madam", aka Vetinari's aunt, a seamstress (hem hem)? And exactly what part was she playing in the assassination of Lord Winder and his replacement with Lord Snapcase? And, subsequently, what was her role in Vetinari's ascension to the Patricianship? In short what sort of... business... did she have in Ankh-Morpork? If this goes well, I have other questions about things like Gavin from The Fifth Elephant and Lady Margolotta and Angua's family and Ysabell and Albert and Binky. That last sentence would have been a different paragraph if the enter button would work, but it won't.

      Yay! Sophia's back! We missed you. In other news, my hair is considerably shorter. It's cold, but pleasantly fuzzy, and doesn't really look that bad. Just incredibly different. Despite this, I look forward to having long hair again after the show. I'll have to put it in corn rows more often. Also, before shaving it all, I only had half a head of hair. I will have pictures of both alternative hairstyles. Okay, there was a lot more to this post, but blogger's being stupid and I lost most of it.

      ...who only thinks he is a person ~Penny Arcade  Yay, Sophia's back! We missed you. In other news, I have considerably less hair than usual, and have recieved much congratulation on shaving quite a bit of my hair for a single scene. It doesn't look that bad, actually, and is pleasently soft and fuzzy, though a bit cold. Despite its advantages, it will be grown to its original length. I could get used to it being incredibly short, but two days before cutting it i had it in cornrows and it looked awesome! The day after that, only half was shaved. Nathan's idea, we had a few different explainations to toss out at anyone who asked, my favourite being that we were running late and could only shave half. We will have pictures, for anyone interested.  Explanation on the new template: Nathan and I had an arguement about one of the prostitute costumes. I said she looked like a ninja prostitute and he insisted she was a pirate. The arguement was long and rather pointless.  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

      Wow.  Thank you Nathan for that rousing rendition of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight".  I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to that song the same way again. In other news, I'm alive!  Kinda.  I know I quit and then came back and didn't post and blah blah blah...sorry about all that.  I've been working this summer!  Actually WORKING!  Did you think that was possible?  And at school, no less.  I've been working for the registrar and in the bookstore...fun stuff, eh?  But I stopped doing that because I strained my back lifting books and stuff.  Just think about that when you go to registration you LC folks...I hurt myself so that ya'll could get books.  :D  Just kidding.  But it's gonna be funky this year...all the books are in the Studio Theater and you're going to get them at Registration.   You LN people are lucky.  But I got money for our stupidity, so it's all good.  Anyway, I hope my posting isn't too weird for all of you...I'm just bored and don't really have much to do.  Sorry.  Bye!

I seriously think it could work as a musical.  The "weiner wort", of course, refers to what they put in the sausages.  It's a great book, but it'll be weeks before I can eat another sausage.  In other news, guess what one of our numbers for the fall choir show is gonna be?  Hint: It was the title of an episode of  Sports Night .
