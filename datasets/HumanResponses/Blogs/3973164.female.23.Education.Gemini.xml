						   I saw it - wasn't surprised - learned a few new things - not sure I can trust what I learned - saw a lot of stuff I already new - couldn't look at the war victims - cried for my baby sister who will be going to Afghanistan within a year. My reactions will make the woman who lost her son look like a cold-hearted bitch if anything happens to my sister. I've spent most of my life trying to protect her, watching her back, making sure no one who isn't me or my siblings hurt her in any way. The helpless reality - KNOWING she is going, HOPING she'll come back. My only consolation is that she isn't going to Iraq, but I certainly don't feel better.   My reaction was mostly disgust. I just watched a film that may or may not have portrayed my President in a fair light (I'm inclined to think he's more idiot than evil, more spoiled rich kid than elite conspiritor) - but certainly established the fact that our world is madness and chaos and there is no reasonable solution. At this point voting George W. out may or may not make things any better...the option is not so appealing either.   Kerry: "Americans are playing by the rules while a whole group of people are writing rules for themselves and leaving the rest of America out of it,"  urlLink Kerry said . "We're going to change that around. Help is on the way."   Does that actually make sense to anyone? Who is 'the group'? If Americans are playing by the rules who are 'the rest of Americans' being left out? Who does that leave making the rules for themselves? What rules are we talking about?   He skips the vote on DOMA, after promising to be there, to spend time campaiging. He is as indecisive as Bush is over-decisive. What's worse, a president who can't make decisions and goes along with the flow or a President who makes the wrong decisions and goes against everyone?   Amber to Jen (after the film): It's time to buy an  urlLink island .

						    I read these to remember my religious roots and why I have chosen a different path. I found this  urlLink here . The  urlLink first  one is rather interesting too.       The females are in love with themselves. They want to be males.   They think they will find fulfillment in their fake freedom of women's lib.  They will only find fulfillment in loving devotion to the pleasure of men. MEN not males.  But American males have not fulfilled their duty and God has allowed this women's lib stuff to come upon us as a judgement, a punishment to chastize us to repent.    I can almost understand the reasoning for the first two - I won't bother to expound, however. The last two...what the f***? Didn't Paul admonish singles to stay single? More or less he said marriage was a pain in the ass and should be avoided unless your sex drive was uncontrolable? Women's lib is God's punishment to men or women? I'm not sure I understand.

						   This article makes an excellent point about the ever-infuriating double standard for female behavior in this country. If I am intelligent and outspoken and unintimidated by men I am seen as&nbsp;strange, a man-hater,&nbsp;and probably have some sort of chip on my shoulder. If I say nothing, stay out of the "man's world" completely, play the role of supporter, nurturer and caretaker - or am perhaps shy or interested in things other than the philosophical or political - I am a weak woman, ignoring the blessings of women's lib and pathetically content to live under the control of men. Are we, as women,&nbsp;supposed to have every human characteristic or none of them? Do little boys grow up trying to determine their 'role as a man?' What is appropriate behavior - as a man? It may be a fool's hope, but I dream that one day my daughter(s) will be judged - by themselves and by others - on their chosen role as a human being, not their role as a woman.   My critique of this article is that it embodies the very problem it is criticizing. The fact that someone felt the need to point out that a 'woman' was&nbsp;acting a certain way and another 'woman' is acting another way&nbsp;and the first 'woman' is certainly a more desirable 'woman' than the second -&nbsp;is all bullshit. These 'people' are not even up for election...they don't deserve to be criticized for their personalities no matter what they are. Two people, not hurting anyone, different personal characteristics, different lives and life choices...why are we trying to decide who is the better 'woman?' People get to decide who they want to be and the role they want to play, that is nobody else's business, it's an unalienable right.   Published on Thursday, July 22, 2004 by  urlLink Arianna Huffington   In Praise of Unruly Women  by Arianna Huffington   Teresa Heinz Kerry is a breath of fresh air, so why are the media choking on it?  Almost every story about her these days includes at least one snarky remark, usually attacking her for her refusal to endlessly regurgitate the same preapproved talking points.  According to the chattering class, Heinz Kerry is, and I quote, "too outspoken," "too opinionated," "slightly zany," "eccentric and unpredictable," "the queen of direct" and, cover your ears, kids, "says what she thinks, when she thinks it."  In other words, she's an unconventional straight shooter. The horror!  (Reporters also seem to have a big problem with her hair, which has variously been described as "unkempt," "unruly," "humidity-frizzed," "voluminous" and "expensively colored a rich auburn," but that's follicle fodder for another column.)  Even Maureen Dowd, no slouch herself in the independent-thinking department, felt compelled to write not one but two columns in the course of 10 days slamming Teresa for, among other things, being "flaky."  You gotta love this about our media mavens: They are constantly bemoaning the lack of forthrightness in our pubic figures&nbsp;- the vast majority of whom wouldn't know a straight answer if it bit them in the butt. But when they are finally presented with someone who doesn't (pardon the _expression) beat around the bush, they start sharpening the long knives.  They're like a bunch of little kids who have gotten so used to being fed nothing but vanilla ice cream for dessert that a serving of Rocky Road with some sprinkles on top leaves them sputtering and crying, "Yuck!"  Most of the American public, on the other hand, possess a far more developed and discerning palate, and can appreciate more complex and piquant flavors.  And when it comes to spicing up the political dessert tray, Teresa Heinz Kerry is one of the most flavorful and compelling public figures to hit the national stage in decades.  When I first met her in Washington in 1980, she was a very popular Republican wife, with views very similar to the ones she holds today. Now she's a Democratic wife, a philanthropist who oversees a foundation that gives tens of millions to causes like the environment, healthcare and early education, a loving mother, grandmother and stepmother. She grew up in Mozambique, went to college in South Africa where she marched against apartheid, is fluent in five languages, and learned so much about medicine from her oncologist father that friends and family have nicknamed her "Dr. T."  And unlike most politicians, she has a natural gift for intimacy and interacts with campaign crowds of 5,000 as if she were sitting around chatting with a small group of friends.  Yes, she is indeed unabashedly open with her opinions on everything from the war in Iraq ("I would never have gone to war this way") to George Bush ("fazed by complexity") to Botox treatments (she's had them).  But isn't that what we claim to want from those in public life? Or are we comfortable with authenticity only when it's a contrivance manufactured to appear authentic?  "I am the product of living in dictatorships," Teresa has said. "It makes you cherish the ability to be yourself, to have feelings and to speak them when asked. People say I'm blunt. I say, 'No, just honest.'"  It's this honesty that has led the media to brand her with the scarlet O for offbeat&nbsp;- a caricature given national credence by a Newsweek cover that trumpeted: "Is John Kerry's Heiress Wife a Loose Cannon or Crazy Like a Fox?"  It was character assassination by headline, especially since the cover line was not in any way reflective of the story inside, which painted Heinz Kerry as warm, smart, alive, funny, and, yes, brutally honest.  It's hard to imagine that headline&nbsp;- which was, incidentally, written by a man&nbsp;- being used to describe a man. As Marlo Thomas once said: "A man has to be Joe McCarthy to be called ruthless. All a woman has to do is put you on hold."  We may have come a long way, baby, but there is no doubt that there is still a double standard when it comes to women in politics&nbsp;- especially political wives&nbsp;- who are supposed to be smart but not so smart that they're threatening, and strong but not so strong that they are intimidating.  It's a high-wire tightrope act, one that's almost impossible to pull off to the political media's satisfaction. And this at a time when girl power is blossoming in other parts of our culture, especially sports and entertainment. Last week's Olympic Trials featured women going faster, higher, stronger than ever before. And our movie screens are filled with indomitable, determined women like "Kill Bill's" Beatrix Kiddo or Keira Knightley's kick-ass Guinevere in the new "King Arthur."  But try to apply these attributes to politics and the media start acting like it's 1958, they suddenly don't know how to handle smart, accomplished, complex women. Judy Dean wasn't glamorous or supportive enough, Hillary was too smart and too strong, and Teresa is too loose-lipped and too unpredictable.  So it really isn't much of a surprise that the political wife the media seem most comfortable with is Laura Bush, who has chosen to take on the image of the perfect 1950s sitcom housewife.  She's the Harriet Nelson of first ladies, the quintessential deferential spouse, praised by her husband for not "trying to butt in and always, you know, compete" and lauded by the media for her ability "to balance strength and subservience." I guess I missed the moment when subservience became a virtue.  When Laura Bush was asked what advice she'd given her twin daughters before sending them out this summer to campaign for their father, she replied: "Stand up straight and keep your hair out of your eyes." Words to live by&nbsp;- if you're Marabel Morgan. Somehow I don't think those are the same words of wisdom Teresa Heinz Kerry passed on to her stepdaughters before they hit the hustings.  Both Teresa and Laura are scheduled to deliver primetime speeches at their respective party conventions. The contrast between the two&nbsp;- and what this contrast says about the men in their lives&nbsp;- should be stark. Out on the campaign trail, Teresa is given to in-depth discussions about health care and global warming. Laura tends to say things like: "I'm not privy to the policy disputes. I'm not over there at the table where everyone is actually formulating specific policy." Heaven forbid.  "We need to honor women in all their complexity," Teresa Heinz Kerry told me. "It's time that we acknowledge the wisdom women have acquired by managing the chaos of daily life. Women are realists, the glue that holds society together. They bring a reverence to life that's instinctual, not just intellectual."  Thirty-eight million women didn't vote in 2000, many of them because they were so disgusted with our inauthentic politics-as-usual. If even a small percentage of them turn out this November, they could very well end up deciding the election and the direction of the country.  So I propose that we turn on its ear the traditional good-old-boy political litmus test&nbsp;- which candidate would you rather have a beer with? Instead, let's ask the women of America: which candidate's wife would you rather have a cup of coffee with?  © 2004 Christabella, Inc.

						   My housemate and I have this addiction - Law and Order. It is inexpensive and always available so, as far as addictions go, this is a good one to have. While feeding our lust for television drama we came across episode number 17 of the first season of Law and Order: SVU. Dead girl, strangled after having sex, in a hotel while fundraising for a small conservative college, pregnant but husband didn't know...then Dr. Stephens showed up. We started jumping up and down clapping our hands with excitement as though somehow our lives were finally justified because our alma mater was being used as a plot basis for a television show. By the way, IV did it. We commented that the real story had many more interesting twists than did the episode. It wasn't half as disturbing. Which leads me to another episode of the same show. This one was also set in a small, this time Catholic, university...same idea - dead girl, sex, etc. In this case there was no murder, it was an accident. Why is that good drama? The French prof that&nbsp;had been stalking her, watched her fall, die&nbsp;and proceeded to commit necrophilia. Of course, this is revolting and Amber and I asked each other "I wonder who is shouting 'that's my school, that's my school' now?" I do not speak for Amber, but it was almost a boast to no one in particular. "Haha, our school made a cool episode - murder, adultery, carrying father-in-law's child - yours was just gross."   What does this say about our culture? I'm not condoning necrophilia, but it is classified as a Class 'A' misdemeanor; murder is a little bit more than that. Our justice system recognizes that it is a more serious crime to take a life than it is to have sex with a dead body. Why then do we welcome shows and news stories of murder as entertaining and want to hurl when the very idea of necrophilia is mentioned? Is defiling a dead body that much more revolting than taking a life? Why? Because we don't hear of it as often? Are we truly that immune to murder that we shake it off as normal and entertaining? True enough, social stigma, what sociologists call 'informal sanctions' seem to make acts like necrophilia much more severe than murder...that could explain our reactions. Does this seem backward to anyone?   I propose we do our part to change this cultural stigma. Lets all start talking about necrophilia as though it were normal - and disgusting - part of civilization, and only talk of murder as though it were wretched, evil and depraved, an act only a truly twisted, demented person could commit - which it is!

						   I am employed, currently and temporarily, by federal grant money to research at-risk populations in five Wisconsin counties and to advise the powers that be on disaster preparedness and potential problems. Some may find it ironic, but I am kissing heaven for sending me to Hillsdale at this point. If there ever existed a time when a large dose of BS was useful, in fact necessary, this is it. Who can possibly know all the potential problems, truly prepare for disaster and even  find  the at-risk populations. One county worker told me her biggest concern was for all the people who 'move around a lot, don't have phones or televisions, and are isolated from the community due to fear of the authorities.' She said they were the biggest special needs population in the county because&nbsp;'no one can find them and they won't trust anyone they don't know.' Well, thank you for letting me know.&nbsp;I know exactly what to do for people who cannot be found, do not exist on paper and won't answer their doors even&nbsp;if you happen to stumble upon them.&nbsp;So this population will be mentioned in my report as existing somewhere with certain tendencies that make it impossible to foresee&nbsp;their outcome&nbsp;in a mass casualty event. And I'm not making bad money. Another task, find out how children are cared for in shelters, medically treated in absence of parents, etc. Answer: The American Red Cross and The Salvation Army...take them to the ER if there is an emergency. They wanted me to spend the whole summer on this. All they needed was someone to open the emergency plan&nbsp;manual and read it back to them.  &nbsp;  Has anyone looked at the insanity that is the Dept of Homeland Security? The amount of money being poured into it, the reorganization of other departments to facilitate it...established depts once performing relatively useful tasks and services are now either starving for money or forced to do irrelevant jobs, like mine. It was all switched around before anyone had figured out what&nbsp;HS was supposed to do! How does one design something before knowing what its purpose is? When did logic get this warped? "It's like wiping your butt before you poop," where did I hear that? Anyway, whoever decided this whole mess was a good idea needs a lobotomy. My&nbsp;own tax dollars are being wasted on me and&nbsp;it&nbsp;still pisses me off.  &nbsp;  If you ever want to find justification to move to a tropical climate and live in a nude commune on the beach...visit your government - municipal, county, state, federal - and look no farther.

						   Bob, this is entirely your fault and I shall be grateful to you for as long as I can remember to be. I tried to post a very un-witty comment on Bob's blog and realized I had two choices to make that happen. Create my own blog or post anonymously...well, I have never been a big fan of anonymous anything...my own blog it is. Bob, thank you for making my dream come true, I now have a blog. If you had never said that Gauloises were horrible I would never have felt the need to correct you. I smoked those things for 8 months while living in France. I owe them a good deal of my sanity.  &nbsp;  I am now embarking on a new adventure...work. I will soon be gainfully employed by an established learning institution in the moderately great state of Missouri. Somehow I convinced a group of educated men and women that I will be a good role model for&nbsp;and educator of high school boys. It is an all-boys boarding school. Perhaps my acting abilities have taken me farther than I should have gone. Nevertheless, I am slowly getting used to the idea of being self-sufficient, getting up for work everyday, living in my own place, driving my own car, smoking behind buildings so not to be a bad influence on young men.  &nbsp;  In the meantime, I will finish my carefree days with Amber...living the vida loca...I'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain, make no mistake.

						   C'est fini, terminado, finito, finished...Thank God! I can once again hold my head high and unashamed as an upstanding American citizen - no longer willfully and knowingly wasting precious taxpayer money every time I get a paycheck. I am no longer a bio-terrorist...I mean I no longer work in bio-terrorism. I shall begin my journey to a new life and new experiences tomorrow - after suficient partying tonight, that is.   I have very much enjoyed this summer. Living with Amber was surprisingly easy. You'll have to ask her if living with me was just as simple. Doubtful. But, she is a wonderful person, a treasured friend and an impressive drinker. I will miss her dearly, but since she has decided to stay in Beautiful Wisconsin I hope to see her relatively often.  I am extremely excited, surprisingly nervous and naively over-confident as I head to Missouri to take the education of these  urlLink boys  into my hands.  Step one: find a house. Step two: lesson plans. Step three: learn French.  No problem!

						   I read Seraphim's  urlLink post  recounting a seemingly sponteneous conversation about the merits of the Present Progressive(pp, for my purpose here) verb tense. In my blury, blog-reading haze I thought it a normal, average conversation...one that I have had repeatedly. I remember distinctly several times gritting my teeth in frustration due to the lack of this particular verb tense in French.  From here my brain split in two paths. 1) Last night I had a conversation about the nature of and relationship between language and thought. I prefer the idea that thought is only possible with language. (It it consistent with certain brilliant theories of 'self' and 'embodiment' and other such fabulous concepts) Is it possible that speakers of languages without the pp do not conceive the difference between the the act during the act and the act in general? Certainly not, I know the French understand there is a difference between someone playing football before their very eyes, at that specific moment, and someone who plays often, occasionally, in general, but not necessarily at this moment. Although, both would be described "Il joue." It is a time distinction, we use it as emphasis and clarification in Enlgish. Why is there only one verb tense for both in French? I have to add entirely new adverbial clauses in French to get the effect of the verb change in English.  New train of thought: no longer as interested in thought/language phenomenon as the more important question - WHY do some languages have pp and others do not?  2) To come up with any sort of viable working thesis I would have to know a lot more than I do about verb tenses in different languages and their respective cultures, history, climates, societies, etc. Since I don't have this information I should just stop, but...maybe I can find a few patterns with those I do know. Spanish has it, French doesn't, Romanian (I'm told) doesn't, English does - where is the connection? Language does not develop randomly, it is an extremely rational, pragmatic evolution. (eg. the English have dozens of words for 'ugly' and the French have as many for 'cheese' and we have a bunch for 'fat' - it's cultural) There is an explanation - there must be!  Romance Language: No(2) Yes(1) History, wars, values, society, leisure, government, national identity...AHHHH  My problem is that my mind is going to keep following one path, then the other, then both at the same time, etc. until I find something to satiate it, but I am also WAY too lazy to get the information necesary to figure it out. Result: Logical Confusion and temporary insanity.  Thank you, Seraphim !

						   J'adore cette  urlLink chanson  ! La musique est une melange des styles rai (d'algerie) et francais. L'artist s'appelle Faudel (quel mignon).  urlLink Trouvez-le.  Faudel est un exemple extrordinaire que, en face de la racisme et de la haine qui existe trop en France contre les arabes, les turques et presque tous les etrangers, la musique, et l'arte, est plus forte que jamais ! Il chante "je veux vivre" et c'est vrai. Tout le monde doit desirer vivre et desire que tous les autres vivre aussi. Oui, je suis une petite 'hippie' avec ma tete dans les nuages mais il faut croire qu'on puisse ameilleurer. Sans celle croyance...ou seront-nous?
