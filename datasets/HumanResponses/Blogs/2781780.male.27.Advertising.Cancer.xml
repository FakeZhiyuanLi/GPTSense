      Excerpt from the official GWB re-election site: "Kerry Voted For Authorization To Use Force In Iraq. (H.J. Res. 114, CQ Vote #237: Passed 77-23: R 48-1; D 29-21; I 0-1, 10/11/02, Kerry Voted Yea.)  In First Dem Debate, Kerry Strongly Supported President’s Action In Iraq. KERRY: “George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.” (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)  Kerry Later Claimed He Voted “To Threaten” Use Of Force In Iraq. “I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.” (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Announcement Of Presidential Candidacy, Mount Pleasant, SC, 9/2/03)  Now, Kerry Says He Is Anti-War Candidate. CHRIS MATTHEWS: “Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it’s been fought, along with General Clark, along with Howard Dean and not necessarily in companionship politically on the issue of the war with people like Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt? Are you one of the anti-war candidates?” KERRY: “I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don’t believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.” (MSNBC’s “Hardball,” 1/6/04)"  Let me get this straight... > He votes for the war > He says he supports the President > Then he says he voted to "threaten the use of force"  > Now he is anti-war (like he never voted for it.)  HUH?  Do you want a guy who doesn't know what HE thinks leading our country?

      "I believe that the president's leadership and the actions taken in Iraq demonstrate an incompetence in terms of knowledge, judgment, and experience," Pelosi told reporters gathered to hear her remarks.     Some Dems Just Don’t Get It! "The results of his (President Bush) action are what undermine his leadership, not my statements.  The emperor has no clothes. When are people going to face the reality?" "Bush is an incompetent leader. In fact, he's not a leader. He's a person who has no judgment, no experience and no knowledge of the subjects that he has to decide upon." "… the president's capacity to lead has never been there."  "In order to lead, you have to have judgment. In order to have judgment, you have to have knowledge and experience. He (Bush) has none."  In a time of war, these kinds of public remarks only provide encouragement and comfort to the enemy.  We are at war and our servicemen and women, day in and day out, put their lives on the line to stop evil tyranny and their terrorist activity.  Remarks like these only give more reason for the enemy to continue their attacks on our troops and freedom. These are not remarks made by an “enemy” of the United States….or are they?  Who really is responsible for these words?  None other than Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Leader in the House of Representatives.   Are these the kind of statements we would expect from leaders of our government?   Even though Pelosi voted against the war, she promised that Democrats would stand "shoulder to shoulder" with Bush in the war on terror. Is this what shoulder-to-shoulder looks like?   At a time of war when America needs to come together, no matter what our political views may be, we find a leader in the Democratic Party, trying to pickup votes for a visionless party and presidential nominee.  Why is it so hard to understand that tyranny and evil will have to be confronted sometime and some place?  On our shores, in our cities, with far more casualties, or right where the enemy lives.

         Kerry makes a gesture displaying the size of his vision for America.  John Kerry is running a whole campaign without an original idea.  He has laid out his platform which basically says: 'Anyone, but Bush;'  'I'll do everything better;'  'If I was President everything would be better.'  Did I miss something?  If it was a one man race John Kerry would have no platform...no one to help him define himself...no one to verbally one up...no one to be criticize for being courageous...  John Kerry is crippled by his need to be accepted by everyone.  This race comes down to a man who has no vision and no spine vs. a President who chooses to do what is right even if it costs him politically.  I choose the guy with a spine and a moral compass.

      President Bush took the advice of the intelligence community and the United Nations that Iraq had chemical and biological weapons.  He chose to trust information from the world and our best and brightest rather than that of a mass murderer.  Since our invasion we have not found what we had been led to believe...  Until now - could we be seeing evidence of these weapons?  Check the link to see this breaking story.   urlLink WMD news

      As I looked at the photos of the tragic and inhumane killing of Nicholas Berg I was horrified.  I was confronting the images of our enemy - the people who would kill our families in the same way.  After observing these photos I want to ask you... Who would you rather lead our country?  John Kerry?   A flip flopping people pleaser who changes his tune...  A man who would treat this as a law enforcement issue rather than a matter of war..  A man who blames us first and our enemies second...  A man who would rather appease instead of taking the hard path of confrontation...  What about George Bush?  He has proven he backs up his words with action.  He calls us time and time again to remember that we are in a war.  This is not a law enforcement issue - we must see this issue differently.  He goes after those responsible and calls the best out of America.  He is a man of conviction who chooses a path he believes in rather than the politically rewarding and safe path.  In this time of terror I will choose the man who has principle, honesty, strength and believes in America.  I encourage you to think of your security and to vote for Bush.

         As Kerry stood looking stoic before the body of Ronald Reagan what was he thinking?    In 1984 campaign literature John Kerry writes:  “We are continuing a defense buildup that is consuming our resources with weapons systems that we don’t need and can’t use.   “The Reagan Administration has no rational plan for our military. Instead, it acts on misinformed assumptions about the strength of the Soviet military and a presumed ‘window of vulnerability,’ which we now know not to exist.   “And Congress, rather than having the moral courage to challenge the Reagan Administration, has given Ronald Reagan almost every military request he has made, no matter how wasteful, no matter how useless, no matter how dangerous.   “The biggest defense buildup since World War II has not given us a better defense. Americans feel more threatened by the prospect of war, not less so. And our national priorities become more and more distorted as the share of our country’s resources devoted to human needs diminishes.”  As we look at the accomplishments of Ronald Reagan and remember that it was his policies that helped tear down the wall of communism, you have to wonder if Kerry will always be on the wrong side of history.  Mr. Kerry - keep the photo ops coming, but we know how you really feel.

      What if that person was John Kerry?  What if now he was backing off that stance because hindsight is 20/20?  What if he is now pretending to be above the intelligence that pointed to the IRAQ threat?  What if?   BUT - John in his own words states his case for the war in a little documentary found at the GOP site:  urlLink Kerry Documentary    Check it out - be informed - don't let the spin masters get away with their garbage!

      When I wash a car I like to keep the  car  wet, and  myself  dry. Call me odd, but that's the way I like it. What I like, and what a kindergartener named Superman likes are very different programs.  As you know, we have a newer car. I've been looking forward to cleaning it all week. Finally, Saturday morning comes. I met with a client, then I'm off to clean the car. I started with the inside. I wanted it to feel brand new. I'm scrubbing, cleaning, wiping... you know the drill. I get done with the passenger side and move to the driver side and notice there are 2 little boys (kindergarten) hanging out in the carport next to me. They are playing with the hose. Awe, how cute. Cute until I became a target that is.  Most of you know I like to have a good time and horse around. This time was a little different. Not because my goal of cleaning the car was thrown off track by 2 cute kindergarten boys. It was different because I didn't know if washing a car and getting into a water fight with 2 kids is legal! So, after declaring a quick loss in the water fight (and realizing my car was NOT going to get clean today) I got the heck out of there.  Yeah I know, I'm a little paranoid. Had it been kids I knew, we would have had a BLAST. So, I left the kids feeling victorious, and came home feeling ticked at all the  social sponges  out there that make this world less fun that it needs to be. What a mess.  Someday it will all be different. I'm looking forward to that each day I get older.

      Word is starting to spread about  urlLink onPO!NT Media Group  (opmg). God brought another client this week. I'm excited about this project not only because it's $$, but because it's a ministry. I get a charge out of helping others "do the work". This is how I stay connected with "ministry".  There is rarely a week that goes by where I don't wonder if I should be connected with ministry on a more formal basis. Ministry is where my heart is, but not my calling at this stage in the game. I know, that sounds odd. However, the tug on my heart is fueling my calling.   I guess that's the PO!NT of it all.

      Every now and then I get little reminders that God is listening to my "everyday prayers". Everyday I ask Him to bless, among other things, my relationships. As I fell asleep last night I couldn't deny the fact that He has and continues to. I just got off the phone with 2 of my closest friends. They are both in Michigan, 1200 miles away. Although they are a 24hr dirve away, the relationships connect like they are just down the block. We get chatting and time slips away. It's always a good, a.k.a. God, thing.  Friends that true help me stay onPO!NT.  They keep me focused.  Thanks guys. You know I love you.

      If you have been reading Amelia's " urlLink  point of contact  " you know that we have a  urlLink newer car .  Sometimes I wonder if at the core of a car's existence is the need to challenge my faith. If you have ever had car trouble, you know just what I'm talking about. Because a car is so practical, when it breaks down I wonder how God could have overlooked the situation. I complain to God.  What did I ever do to deserve this?  You know I’m trying to save for a house. This isn’t fair!  The car seems light when compared to other people’s burdens. I know. I understand that. That’s a lesson most of us learn in Sunday school. However, that’s much different than the lesson I’m relearning this time around. What’s been most revealing through this situation is that I have replaced faith with my own sinful griping. My gripes assume one thing: God isn’t watching over me. I know that assumption is full of holes, BUT it takes the weight off of my shoulders to have faith. Faith requires me to look beyond the situation and still see a faithful God. Maybe that’s why they call it faith.   So, two weeks ago I started looking through the black smoke rolling out of the Concorde and began looking for the faithful God I knew was there all along. He was just around the corner waiting with a 2002 Lancer that Amelia and I affectionately call “God’s Car”.

      I didn’t realize anyone knew about “What’s the PO!NT?” or even read it until the last post. I had several people e-mail me with notes of concern. I was surprised. As a result, I didn’t post the past few days. It’s been a consuming thought, and didn’t feel people would want to wade through emotions.  These types of situations have a way of shedding light on our views of God. We all-of-a-sudden have to make the situation fit within our view of who He is.   Sometimes it doesn’t work.  Sometimes our view of Him changes.  Sometimes that a good thing.

      Most people know I do a  LOT  of web/print work through  urlLink www.onpointmediagroup.com . It has been a great way for me to stay creative, and also pay the bills. I do projects that range from postcards to billboards, and  EVERYTHING  in between.   The majority of my projects are comfortable. They fit within the way I like to view the world. However, I'm currently working on a project that doesn't fit between a postcard and billboard. In fact, it doesn't fit anywhere.  Where would you put a project that tells the story of a man with the following:  a beautiful wife     4 great kids (college to middle school)     good career...         brain tumor   You can't peg that kind of project, and it sure doesn't fit within the way I like to view the world! This project requires more than just a creative mind. It requires something deeper. It requires a piece of me that I can't get back. A piece of my heart that I don't easily give away. Why? Because it hurts for crying-out-loud!  I don't  want  to do this sort of project. What I want infinitely less is for my uncle to have a brain tumor.  I love you uncle Ben.

      Doug Monahan, founder and chairman of Sunset Direct, recently received a rather exclusive award. However, just because it’s exclusive doesn’t mean you want it. The award was given by  urlLink Business 2.0  as part of their annual “101 Dumbest Moments in Business” feature. Doug received the “Dumbest Moment in Human Resources" for issuing the following memo.   "I expect my computers to be used for work only. I expect my phones to be used for work only. Should you receive a personal call, keep it short. Should you receive a personal e-mail, I expect the e-mail either not answered, or a brief note telling whoever is sending you e-mails at work to stop immediately. Should I go through machines, which I assure you, I will be doing, and I find anything to the contrary, you will be terminated immediately. For those who think I am kidding, and do not get with this program, I will promise you that by Christmas eve 8:00 you will be gone."   I would assume that from his memo this guy isn’t familiar with Dale Carnegie or the book “ How to Win Friends and Influence People .”   This type of behavior fuels my theory that there are more jerkwads in leadership then there are good people in leadership. Maybe I’m just cynical, or maybe there is a bit of truth in that thought. Never-the-less it’s been my experience that those that are loud, obnoxious, self-centered and object driven (as apposed to people driven) seem to make their way up the corporate ladder faster than the truly genuine leader. It’s been a sour pill to swallow, but an eye opening one as well.  I want to believe that someday these tyrant leaders will get their just rewards. However, that would require Business 2.0 to increase the recipients from 101 to 1000001. Meanwhile I’ll try not to get caught up in handing out judgment and having pity parties.

       urlLink Amelia  and I hit the pavement for a 2 mile walk when I get home from work most nights of the week. This is our time to connect. We chat hand in hand about life, goals, owning a house someday, kids, faith, business, culture... the list goes on. Needless to say it's the highlight of my day.   One of our most talked about subjects is  faith . Not faith as in; what religion we subscribe to. We know where we stand with that one. Instead, we talk about the kind of faith that moves us through the day. You know, things like: I felt forgotten today. Did He forget, or did I lose focus? In fact, that was our most recent conversation.   I came home from work in a rare mood where I felt like God was ignoring me. O.K. I'll confess, the mood is not as rare as I'd like it to be. We have been trying to save money and do some things for some people we love. Just when we get things headed in the right direction our car starts having trouble. I felt forgotten.  Amelia greeted me at the door. I quick change clothes and we hit the pavement. She soon began to tell me about her day and what she was dealing with. It came up that she was feeling the same thing that morning. She, on the other hand, handled it much better than I.  This is one of those times when I just shut-up and listen. She began to tell me how she started listing all the things she was grateful for. Things like good friends and roof over our head. It didn't take long to realize I had lost my focus. She then recounted all the times in our past where we felt like God had forgotten, and in hindsight He was with us every stumble, trip and fall of the way.  I needed those reminders. It was one of those times where God heard my moaning and sent and angel to set my focus back on Him.

      As you can see, I have been out of the blog for a few days. I try to unplug as much as I can on the weekends, and this week has been a whirlwind. UT launched their  urlLink new site  this past Monday which required me to pull an all-nighter. I’m still recovering.  I was just commenting to Ameliou that I have had several thoughts this week that I wanted to flush out in the blog, and I can’t remember a single one of them. I think it’s the lack of sleep. Even now, as I sit here typing away, I have no idea what is going to come out next…  I’ll be pulling the hits for  urlLink www.iamwatermark.com  soon. If you live in the Grand Haven area, you need to visit. =)  O.K. I’m not going to force any more thoughts out tonight.

      I want to give a shout out to my big sis. Hey girl, I love ya big time. Hang in there!  Also, a quick welcome to CRobertson. Welcome buddy.  So, I’ve been thinking. (practicing what I preach) More like I’ve been observing, and then thinking. I think that might be good way to go about it.   Here’s the scoop.  This guy goes on a family vacation along with his in-laws. Everything is great until he butts heads with his mother-in-law over a minuet detail.   He explodes. They get in a fight. Everything is ugly.  However, being the good Christian he is, he apologizes. They fix things up, and vacation is back to beaches and sunshine.   As he recalls the story and sends up a “praise God” I can’t help but wonder how many people use God as an escape-goat for allowing their tempers to fly (among other things).  Now your saying to yourself: “Isn’t that the way it should work? Aren’t we supposed to go back and ask our brothers forgiveness if we hurt them?”   Yes, that is the way it should work. (pause) However, I’m watching people emotionally assassinate others over and over again, and rebound 20 minutes later with an apology. They operate from the belief that when they apologize, the other person is bound, required and obligated to forgive them, allowing them to go back to enjoying the beach and catching rays.  Doesn’t that bother anyone? It should! These people are using scripture as a safe place to hurt people. Their apology has become a tool to manipulate people into letting their sin be swept under the carpet and their own childish temper to go un-dealt with.   For them, it’s easier to go back and ask forgiveness that it is to control their temper. Besides, once they ask for forgiveness, it’s up to the forgiver to deal with it right? They think they have shifted the burden back to the offended.  Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m all about the forgiveness process. God has it in place for a reason. However, that reason doesn’t include manipulating people. The forgiveness process is about having a change of heart. It’s about rebuilding what was destroyed. It’s not about checkmarks and bourdon shifting.   Caught up in that cycle? Get some help.  Tired of being manipulated? Challenge the offender and reestablish boundaries. You don’t have to be a victim of spiritual manipulation.    That's my PO!NT for today.   urlLink “What shall we say then? Should we continue in sin that grace may increase? May it never be!”

      I received several comments today on yesterday’s blog. It appears that I have hit both a cord and a nerve with one foul swoop of the pen (or keyboard, as the case may be). My PO!NT for being on a blog is to share and develop my thoughts. I don’t do much day-to-day recaps.  urlLink I’ll leave that to the pro!  I’m here to flush out my thoughts, and force myself to wade through the process of finishing one. (I know some of you find that hard to believe.) It’s a healthy process, and one that I find challenging.  I’m currently working on a blog entry that I started back in November. If you notice, I didn’t have a blog back in November. Actually, it’s the “thought” I was wading through that challenged me to find a way to flush it out and share it. Hence the blog.  I’m convinced that most people don’t do enough thought thinking. I know that sounds odd, but follow me on this one. Most people go day-in-and-day-out without finding something new to think about. Each day brings along it’s own set of concerns and priorities, and we focus on managing the affect they have on our life. That’s life. That’s what we do.  I think we need to take our  thinking  one step further. We need to find a  new  thought to think about, to sort out and figure out. Our minds need the stimulation.  I hope you're getting what I’m saying, and not getting what I’m not saying. I’m  not  saying we need to carve out hours in our day to philosophize over odd scenario and what-ifs. What I am saying is that we need to recognize new thoughts, and see where they go. I’m also  not  saying they have to be deep thoughts, or even interesting thoughts. Sometimes you don’t know what kind of thought it will be until you wade through it. There is no harm in wading through a thought, only to come to the conclusion that it was a boring thought. It’s the exercise that counts.  I hope that gets you thinking, and that’s my PO!NT.

      I took Sunday away from the computer. I don't think I even checked my e-mail yesterday. It's my day to "unplug." Check out PO!NT of Contact for the details.  I will be posting some George W. stuff on my site tonight. They have a bunch of things you can use at  urlLink www.georgebush.com .  I have too many friends that are afraid to stand up for a political party. Some of them can't because they are in ministry. I don't think they are allowed to endorse anyone. It's something about church and state. I don't know all the details. The ones that are not in ministry are the ones I'm getting concerned about. I can't tell if they just don't care who runs the country, or they are trying to be politically correct about politics!   Here is what I see going on.  Too many "Christians" are using God as an excuse to sit on the sidelines. They quote verses about how God appoints leadership. They also use "relevancy" as their excuse. They think by not saying anything at all, they are avoiding a conflict that could somehow turn people off to Christ. "You can't have that kind of conflict and be relevant in today’s culture." or "If you tick them off politically, you'll never win them spiritually."   Here is my thought:  YOU will NEVER win them spiritually. That part is NOT up to you! Besides, if you want to influence someone, you have to have an end in mind. That means you have to have a value that you are pressing towards. Influence involves a reaction. A reaction involves an energy that must be dealt with.  The next big group I see is one that votes based on a financial agenda. They have ideals as to where they think money should go. Good ideals I'm sure. They want to see more funding to help the poor, aids patients, homeless and other charity groups. I guess I can see how those could be noble agendas. So, they vote for the party they think will help bring that kind of humanitarian work.   Here is my thought:  If you call yourself a Christ follower, you won't depend on the government to do humanitarian work for you. You will get your hands dirty, and do it yourself! Why? Because that's what Christ did! He didn't expect the Roman government to feed the hungry or tend to the sick. He did it, and then commanded us to do it!  That group may have noble intentions, it’s the trade off is what concerns me. If you vote for "the little man" party, you may get your humanitarian efforts, but you loose a LOT of moral virtues that Christ followers hold dear. You know, things like valuing the life of an unborn child and the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman (the way God designed it).   Here is my thought:  Since when did a financial agenda become more important that the fundamentals of our faith? There are plenty of financial pillars within the Christian faith that should be valued and adopted, but when did money become more important than human life? Why would you vote for someone that doesn’t value the same basics that you do? Is your financial agenda more important than that? WOW, I hope not.  Now, I’m not so naive as to think that George W. is perfect. I know there are things we all would like to see changed. What I’m trying to say is that I think we, as a church, need to engage others about politics. We, collectively, and individually have a lot of influence, and it’s O.K. to use that influence in politics.  My prayer between now and November's election will be that those who call themselves Christ followers will voice their beliefs. Stand for them. Share them. Vote for them.   I will not hope for tomorrow good things, while today sowing no good seed.  That’s my PO!NT.

      I was in the middle of blogging last night when my computer crashed on me. My computer does that on a daily basis. I was too tired to start over.  Anyway, as I was saying last night, I finally got my  urlLink Adobe software . I'm not sure why I paied for the next day shipping. Well, I thought I knew why I was paying for it. I needed the software last weekend. I got it a week later. However, it was delivered one day after it was shipped. WOW! It took a week for someone it the shipping department to put a lable on my box and stick it in the mail. If I worked like that I would go hungry!  This is just one more reason I have always thougt Adobe was in the stone age. I know, the software rocks. We all know that. It better for the price you pay for it! I mean the company is in the stone age. They have been late bloomers on many products. If it wasn't for Acrobat, that company would go under. In fact,  urlLink Acrobat  was the product that pulled them out of the dummpers.  On another note. I told you that I would be adding more photos to the site. Here is one that was taken last summer in  urlLink Alaska .  Looks as if it was taken here in FL! Lots of green. Anyway, I'm posting it because it's one of my favs of my best friend and I.

      There are only 2 things at McDonalds worth going for; the McGriddle and the shamrock shake. O.K., there may be a few other things on the menu that fit your fancy, but these 2 are  my  favorites. And, since today is St. Patrick's day... you can see the rest.     I'm going to make it a PO!NT to post a LOT more pictures. Why? Why not?!  I hope you enjoy the new trend.

      OPMG is getting a much need navigation face-lift. I have had several people comment on how hard it was to get around the site. So, back to the drawing board. I'm trying to cram it in between other jobs. That's not always easy. On one hand you HAVE to turn work around. On the other hand, you can't present yourself half-baked. No worries though. It will be done SOON.  Speaking of soon. www.bencarrfamily.com will be up and running this week. (I told myself I would have it done last week...) Are you holding your breath? I am!   I have been teaching myself to play the guitar as of late. It's been a good challenge. Both of my parents are musically tallented. I'm trying to see if I have any of those genes. As much as I love music, I must have something in there waiting to come out. In the mean time, I'm having fun, and Sadie is humoring me.

      God has been blessing my work like crazy the past few weeks. I think He is trying to prove to me that I don’t  have  to be perfect to be blessed. I know I have struggled a lot with that idea over the years. I think He is pulling me past that. I hope so…  I have a new project that I’m excited about. Here is the URL:  urlLink www.studyantiquity.org   I will be doing the same kind of work that I did for  urlLink www.iamwatermark.com . They needed a logo, stationary and Web site. I love doing this sort of work from the ground up. I’m also excited about working with Doug and Scott on this project. I worked with both of them at CU, and had a blast with them. They are both great guys, and have a LOT of passion for their work. I can’t help but get excited about this project. I will keep you all posted on the progress.  On another note:  urlLink www.bencarrfamily.com  is almost up and running. I have to add a few small things to the site, and it will be done. I hope you all check it out when it goes live.

      If you are looking for updates on the d2 you need to check out  urlLink PO!NT of Contact . I don't do much of that here... just so you know. Anyway...  Ameliou and I have been lamenting over the distance to our 2k4 friends. If it wasn't for sis coming down and my lil cuz in Orlando,  urlLink See Spot Rock  would not have rocked much at all. We need some nxgn connections in this area. I guess that comes with time... or  chance .  I said "chance" just to make you wonder if I believe in the word.   I'll let you wonder.  Well, I had a 350 word blog ready to post. It was about friends and friendship. I hit the preview to read my own thoughts back to myself, then decided to Crtl-X. I'll let you wonder on that one as well.  The truth is, I don't know who reads this blog. Therefore I should keep some thoughts closer than others. Now you're really wondering. Good. That's the PO!NT.  While you're wondering;   Have you ever asked yourself why this blog is called "What's the PO!NT?"?   What's your PO!NT?  Don't fall asleep without asking yourself.

      There is a reason they call it “ urlLink The Magic Kingdom .” The magic there can bring out the kid in anyone. Maybe that’s why I like it so much. I love being a kid; just ask Amelia.   As you know, Disney has 4 parks: The Magic Kingdom, MGM Studios, Epcot and The Animal Kingdom. They all are very different, and obviously very successful. One thing I noticed this time around about The Magic Kingdom was that it felt old-school…  reeeaaalllllly  old-school. It felt like it was conceived at a time when little boy’s adventures consisted of broomstick horses and giant lollypops. I’m sure it still strikes a cord with all the grandparents that get dragged around the park by their grandchildren though. Never-the-less, it’s still a great park.  As a creative professional, I get a charge from going to those parks. You can’t help but be swept away by the magic there. I get back to the office with so many buzzing ideas. The atmosphere allows you to think bigger, and dream longer. I love it.  The same love I have for Disney isn’t shared by many of the locals though. I hear the same small thinking as I did in G.R. about  urlLink Quixtar/Alticor . I don’t think people like to face the fact that 1 or 2 men can change the world through something as basic as capitalism and a dream. It forces them to deal with their own lack of ambition and lack of dreams. That’s a sad way to look at success if you ask me. The success of those companies aught to inspire you, change you, motivate you and free you. Maybe that’s why I like visiting those places. If you have been to Disney you know how overwhelming the attention to detail can be. Also, if you have ever been through the “miracle mile” you know how awe inspiring that can be. Both built by big dreamers. Both inspire. Both challenge your thinking.  I have a gabillion more thoughts on dreamers and inspiration. I’ll save those for my book.

      I have been catching up with an old friend via AIM this week. It has been great to connect with yet another guy that is headed in the right direction. He has killer Flash skills, and a big heart to boot. He gave me some  MUCH NEEDED  Flash help for the " urlLink Ben site ". (thanks nD!)  AIM is a wonderful thing.  On another note:  Small Town Poets  have a new album coming out.  urlLink www.smalltownpoets.com   At one time STP was my fav band. They have been out of the biz for a few years starting families. I'm stoked about their return. They have been one of the most influential bands in my life over the years. They have so many songs that bring back memories. Kurt and I saw them in G.R. a few years ago. That was a concert highlight for the both of us. I like them for being real with their music. They don't write "sing-songy" lyrics, or over Christianize everything. They are poets, and I like that. The combo of poetry and music is a powerful one.  Check em out at a  urlLink FCS  empire near you.

      I have a lot contact with a few folks at CU. They keep me posted with what's going on there. I received a nice update the other day. It appears that CU is hiring yet another person to do my old job. Here is how it breaks down.  I started as the 1 and only web guy. The art director left, and I moved up to graphic designer/1 and only web guy. CU liked my work and made me the art director/graphic designer/ 1 and only web guy.  I hated that job(s). I loved CU, but hated the stress. I loved my clients, but hated being  told  to keep doing more work with  less  pay.  Needless to say that it feels awesome to know that it has taken 3+ people to do my job. I say 3+ people because when I left we had 1/2 graphic designer. (freelancer) The CU staff now has 4 people running it. (2 designers, web programmer and web designer)  I LOVE IT!  I love CU. I learned a LOT there.  Will I ever work that kind of job again? NEVER! I managed over 800 jobs a year! Hello!!  Anyway, I feel good. =)

      I’m sure that most of you caught up on our mini-vacation at  urlLink PO!NT of Contact .  Be sure to check out the pictures at that site.  I’m sure no one knows, but I have been working on a VERY BIG project for OPMG. It’s a product I would like to launch this summer. I’m sure it will be a big hit in the CMS world. I won’t bore you with the details… or give away my brilliant ideas. =)  For those of you who have been keeping track, the CSA drama is over. I am still working with them; however the drama is down to a dull roar. I love those guys; it’s the Stone I get frustrated with. They help me rise above it though.  On another front: It sounds like I may have company on the drive up north this summer. My uncle Dan may be riding with me. I am truly looking forward to that! He is a great guy, and I think we will have a blast! I’ll be sure to post some pics of our trip.  Well, no big PO!NTS today. I have some rolling around in my head, and should be flushing them out… however; I have some work to do.

      So, did you miss me? I did!  The reason for not shouting the PO!NT: time.  Starting last week, I lost almost 2 hours a day to a construction debacle. As a result, I haven’t had enough time to get online. Scary.  urlLink Here is the scoop .     2 hours a day is a huge chunk of time in my already busy schedule. It's been hard to make up for that. I try to compensate by staying up later, and drinking a pot of coffee before noon. By the end of last week I could see the bags starting to form under my eyes.   Things are starting to clear up though, so you will be hearing more from me this week.

      I get to the end of my day and ask myself if I hit the PO!NT. It’s a brief time of reflection where I go over the days events and try to identify where my PO!NT met up with reality. I think today was a so-so day. I can see where I was onPO!NT, but I wasn’t in the game 100%. Tomorrow is a new day.  On another note; I think there has been some confusion about the title of my blog. I can clearly see why and where the confusion takes place. Most of you know that I run a growing marketing company called onPO!NT Media Group. O.K., Ameliou really runs it, I just add my 2 cents in on occasion.  Here is a little background.   OPMG came about as we were trying to identify a name for our new venture. If you have known me for a while, you may have heard me mention keeping an onPO!NT life. An onPO!NT life is a life lived with a PO!NT. It’s living with a purpose. It’s having your purpose written down and in front of you on a daily basis. Ameliou says it best: “If you’re not living onPO!NT, you are living with no point.” We used that correlation with our marketing company. We focus on finding and communicating the point you are trying to make. Why? Because if your marketing isn’t onPO!NT, it has no point.  Moving right along. My blog, as you can see, is hosted at OPMG. However, it’s meant to be a reflection of what my PO!NT is, and not a commentary on the happenings of OPMG. See how they are connected but not really?  I know… it’s confusing.  Anyway, that’s myPO!NT 42day.

      I guess you could label me as a reader. I always have a book or 3 in process. (I keep several going because I get bored easily.) I wouldn’t call myself a fast reader, like . urlLink Ameliou , who read an entire novel today. However, I do enjoy a good book.  Most of my reading is on leadership and business related material. As a result of reading several John Maxwell books I have subscribed to  urlLink Maximum Impact Club . The club is a monthly CD subscription hosted and taught by Dr. Maxwell. The CD arrives in a nice jacket along with a fill-in-the-blank workbook to follow along with.  I often have one of his CD’s playing in the car as I go about my day. Yesterday’s lesson was about going from ordinary to extraordinary. It’s a CD that I have listened to a few times before, but this time I caught a concept I didn’t quite connect with.   He made the claim that “people do what people  see .” I know you have heard that saying before, maybe rephrased like “monkey see, monkey do.” It does ring with a bit of truth, but I think the issue is much deeper than this old cliché.  Fundamentally it’s a way to pass the blame for our actions onto others. How many times have you heard; “But Joey uses those kinds of words.” Or “But dad watches that TV show.”   I understand that you have to model the actions you want instilled in people, but that’s not the heart of the issue. Here’s my PO!NT:  People do what people  value .   Example:  If you want your employee to be on-time, than teach them to value punctuality.   You can, and should, teach values through your action. However, it’s more than just “Do as I do.” Those are famous last words. How many times have we all been caught doing the very thing we don’t want others doing? If your actions are your only point of reference for right and wrong than you’re in deep weeds, and so are those emulating your actions. Actions can be misinterpreted, and downright wrong. Actions need to be an out-growth of values.  That should stir up a few questions. Questions like:    What are my values?   How do I live out my values?   Where have I been expecting performance where values need changed?   Where are my actions not connecting with my values?   What does God value, and how do my values need to be realigned?   I know these can be frustrating questions. That’s the PO!NT. These are questions I ask myself on a regular basis. Why? Because I want my life and actions to be value driven. My value system puts meaning into my actions, and establishes boundaries for everyday-living. I also know I don’t have everything aligned correctly. It’s a process I have to work on daily.  So, here is my PO!NT 42day: Monkey do what monkey value.

      "Help, I lost my balls!" At least that is the way I’m interpreting the cats cry for help at 6 a.m. Those of you, who know Sadie, know that she LOVES those little sparkly balls that you get at  urlLink Michaels . They remind me of pompoms huffed up on Britney Spears. Needless to say, she loses them on a regular basis. As a result, you can   often   find Sadie staring under the couch or behind the fish tank letting out random cries for help.  This morning was like many others. I follow Sadie around the apartment with a smirk on my face as she leads me to where she lost her balls; under the couch, entertainment stand, behind the fish tank and in the closet. As I followed her anxious prance from one treasure to the next I couldn’t help but wonder if that's what the Father feels like following me around.   I have a habit of dorking things up and then crying and begging for help. I can just imagine Him close beside me waiting for me to tell Him and show Him when and where I went off track; maybe even with a smirk on His face... as if to say "I'm ready to help when you’re ready to be helped." It doesn't seem to take long for my blubbering and pointing to get His attention. He reaches down, fixes my mess, and then lets me do it all over again.  I suppose that's how grace works. No matter how many times Sadie loses her balls, I'm there to pull the couch out of the way and help her get back to living. I have a feeling that that kind of grace is how He made us to reflect Him. You can't help but see it in His character over and over again.  That's my PO!NT 42day.

      Well, I think I’m back in the saddle. Last week was a LONG one. I think I’m mostly recovered from the all-nighter and the time change.  As you know, we launched the new UT site last week. I know the UT community has no idea how much work that was, and continues to be. We transferred 1,800 pages to a new design. The amazing thing is that the new design accepted the elements of the old. I know that 99% of those reading this don’t know and don’t care what that involves. Trust me, it’s cool.  I received a call from a client and friend this past Friday that took me back to a time and place I never wanted to return to. I won’t go into the details, but it has to do with the Stonewall. I know that won’t make sense to most of you. In fact, Ameliou is the only one who knows the full scoop. Anyway, I’m glad that’s in the past. I have less stomach pain, and less grey hair.  I’ll catch up on my thoughts this week. I have some doozies.

      It was fall, almost four years ago, when Amelia and I found ourselves in a 12 week intensive  urlLink Bible study  on what God has to say about finances. This study consisted of people from all walks of life and all points in their journey with Christ. It wasn’t a group of people you would imagine having an espresso together or catching a baseball game on the weekend with one another. We were all very different, and we knew it.  We met in the private school house of a multimillionaire from 7-9pm each Thursday. Things started promptly at 7 with the group in a circle on their knees in prayer. Each week, each member of the group was responsible for 2 things; memorizing the pre-assigned passage of scripture, and having completed the previous week’s homework. If a member failed to complete one of the two assignments, they were not allowed to participate in the group discussion. Once we had gone through the study and reviewed the following weeks’ assignments we would exchange prayer requests, and once again, gather in a circle on our knees in prayer.   This was an amazing 3 months. The group was honest, caring and insightful. By the end of that study we were a true community.  It’s been 4 years since Amelia and I have been in a group like that. (We co-lead that same study once again the following spring. It was equally as impacting, maybe even more so.) Don’t get me wrong, God has collided us with individuals and couples that we have shared true community with, but nothing in the form of a “small group” since.  This is what I think made those groups work.   Expectation for growth. Expectation for knowing and studying God’s word. Expectation for prayer. Expectation for participation.  It sounds rough, rigid and almost scary doesn’t it? Well who said true community was easy?  There is a price to pay for everything worth having.

      This clipping was taken from the  urlLink President's Memorial Day Proclamation . I thought I would be worth posting on 2 levels. The first; it's informative. The second; it lets you know what a sound man GWB is.   In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated the minute beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 31, 2004, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I urge the press, radio, television, and all other media to participate in these observances.   I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States, and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.

      Everyone wants a piece of the summer film action; and they are willing to go to great lengths to get it.    urlLink Dr. Pepper  is slinging advertisements for Spiderman 2, and I couldn't be happier! Why? As part of their promotions, they are giving away 10 new  urlLink Dodge Vipers ! That's why  urlLink Dr. Pepper  is now my new favorite pop (soda for those in the south).  For those who didn't know, I'm a bit of a Viper fan. I have almost 100 diecast cars to prove it! Here is my pride and joy:     It's a 35th Anniversary Shelby Cobra Hotwheels box set.  So, if anyone wants to drink a little extra Dr. Pepper for me... =)

      The design industry can be frustrating sometimes. Anyone with a computer and a pirated version of Photoshop calls themselves a designer these days. The industry has been flooded with mediocre work at rock bottom prices. As a result, many clients don't want to pay for design (good or bad).  That's why I don't consider myself a designer. That's also why I went back to school and finished a business degree.   Yeah, you heard me; I have a business degree. Yes, I know, creatives generally stay far away from the business end of things (that's one of the reasons I went for it).   Here's the PO!NT  I believe that if OPMG is to stay competitive we have to partner with our clients to deliver a comprehensive experience. That means more than a brochure or Web site. That means understanding their business from the ground up and helping them communicate their PO!NT from every angle. Good marketing penetrates the entire business process.   Designers don't cut the mustard.

      I found myself clashing with  urlLink Maxwell  again today. If you have spent any time listening to him or reading his books, you have undoubtedly heard his view on personal development. Here is the gist of it:   Work on your strengths, and strengths alone. Most people, on a scale from 1-10, will not raise an attribute more than 3 notches. So, if you are a 6 in one area, you could bring that up to a 8 or 9. On the flip side, if you are a 2, you will only advance to a 4 or 5; and people don't pay for average.  I'm struggling with this view PO!NT on a couple of levels.   The f1rst  It's an excuse for not being well rounded. For example: If you are a 2 at dealing with conflict, dealing with people, being honest, finding the good, empowering people, loving your neighbor, etc., you should NOT stay there. You HAVE to move up a few notches! Even if you only make it to a 4 in dealing with conflict, it's better than a 2. A 2 will only leave a path of destruction.   The 2econd  I don't think you will ever be a 9 or 10 in leadership if you are 2 in dealing with people. You can't delegate kindness, and still be an effective leader. You can't delegate a smile and still empower people.  Personally, I work hard on my weaknesses. My weaknesses build walls with my own ego and isolates the ones I love. By Gods grace, I'm knocking down those walls.

      I know you're familiar with everyday brands like Lipton, Slim-Fast, Hellmann's, Axe, Dove and Surf; but did you know they are all part of the  urlLink Unilever  product family?   Uni-what?  Yeah, you know; the company that serves up over 177 BILLION cups of tea every day!  Anyway, I'm sure most people haven't seen their logo, because most people don't know who they are. Try this on for size:     One of the first things you will notice about this logo is that it feels very industrial. It looks like it belongs on the side of a GM parts plant. It's cold and un-friendly. Maybe that's why you haven't seen very much of it.  On a positive note, the logo is very distinguished. The straight lines command respect and dignity.  That aside, I wanted to let you know they have a new logo.     This logo is not only a LOT friendlier, but attempts to communicate who Unilever  is  as a brand. It incorporates 25 other identity pieces from their other brands, in an attempt to tell the Uniliever story. I think they hit the nail on the head. It's bold, friendly, open and all-around memorable.  Inspiring!

      I was sad to see Kurt and Michelle go back to Michigan today. It was wonderful having them down for a few wild days. You will see a photo recap of our adventures at  urlLink PO!NT of Contact  later tonight. What a trip!  Also, you will notice a few changes to our blogs. Mine is kedron.ailema.com and Amelia's is amelia.ailema.com  We are consolidating all the blogs under one roof. We are also adding Kurt and Michelle to the list as well. kurt.ailema.com and michelle.ailema.com  DaveS, you want a blog? I think you need one! That would ROCK!  O.K., some more changes. In effort to keep up on my bloging I am going to give each day a theme. Here is what I'm thinking:    Monday: Marriage PO!NTS   Tuesday: Design PO!NTS   Wednesday: Life PO!NTS   Thursday: Marketing PO!NTS   Friday: no PO!NT   Saturday: no PO!NT   Sunday: Main PO!NT    Let me know what you think!  Yet more changes: I'm using the blogger comments now. So, the old comments are gone. Sad, I know. But this will be better.  O.K. enough about the changes. There will be more, but I wont bore you with them quite yet. =)

      Things are lining up to be a GREAT summer! God has some cool things in store for Ameliou and I, and I'm stoked!  Anyway, I had an awesome weekend with my beautiful bride. We always have a good time together, but this weekend was more than that. We had a chance to connect on some cool thoughts. Big thoughts. I'm always amazed at how different we are; and at the same time, the same.  As I mentioned b4, I have some new design stuff in the mix. I will keep you posted on new developments there.

      I see that a few people are taking advantage of the new templates. Some of the best designers in CSS-land cranked out some nice work for the masses. If you haven't seen the new templates, you need to check them out in your admin area.  As a result of the new Blogger, you will see some nice upgrades to PO!NT of Contact soon. Should be cool. Ameliou has a good size readership, and it's time to take it to the next level!  OK, no real deep thoughts yet today. So, I'll spare you all the agony.

      I can't wait for 24 to be over! WOW... and I still watch it! Drama, drama drama.  This week is going by fast. I know, it's only Tuesday. BUT, my work week is half over! Yeah, you heard me. I'm working 4/10 and Friday off. I love it! The best part is that I get home around the same time; even though I leave a half hour later. It's a good thing. I hope to get some wakeboarding in. =)  O.K. I know this is short, but I have to go get the laundry from the dryer, and Ameliou is chatting a million miles a minute... therefor, I can't finish my thought. LOL. Now I know how she must feel... however, she has the ability to tune me out. If you know what I mean!

      Now that I have eliminated all interest in my blog by not posting, I think I'll start again.  Over the past few weeks I have been focusing on my design skills. I feel like I’m in a growth mode. I’ve had some major breakthroughs in Web usability; the kind of breakthroughs that set a designer apart from the over saturated creative market.   Don’t even get me started on the creative market… you don’t want to go there!  Anyway, it’s Monday and I have a TON of thoughts to dump into my blog this week. Stay posted, cuz I’m back!

      Well, Amelia will be headed north in just a few hours. I know the time will go by quickly, but I am sure going to miss her! I'm hoping it will be a quick 2 weeks!!!  Speaking of 2 weeks. Amelia and I have been praying for a change, and that change may be just around the corner. I'll keep you all posted.  Anyway, I plan on using these 2 weeks to hit the gym, and hit the books. I have a few projects that I need to get cranking on, and it should be a good way for me to pass the time.  O.K. that's all for now. Stay tuned for even bigger news this week... or next, or the next. LOL.

      Pulling an illustration from a few years back.  Meet Thorn.      You all know him.   He's the one that plants those thoughts of gossip, lust and greed. He's the one that keeps fostering that one nasty habit you just can't kick. You know, the habit that's been bugging you for years.  He is part of the comic book I have been kicking around for a few years. I've been wanting illustrate a book that breaks the norms. One that takes a real look at the battle between good and evil, and not some preachy cliches.  Anyway, a few years have gone by since I first illustrated Thorn, and I think he could lose the goatee. =)

      The weather has been awesome the past few weeks. It's been hot, and full of thunder storms. I love it!  Amelia and I went over to Orlando this weekend to check out a few areas that we have never been. We had a blast! I love that city! We also got our KeyLime pie that we have been waiting for for several months. There is a GREAT place for KeyLime over near Downtown Disney. MMMmmm.... I could use another piece!  Anyway, I haven't done much illustrating in the past few months, so I thought I would give it a go. This is what I cam up with...     on fire!  For those that didn't know, I used to do a TON of illustrating. I still plan to publish a comic book one of these days. =)  Oh, yeah. BIG shout out to the gooseEgg! Rock on bro! I can't wait to hear from you!

      If you have been around Ameliou for any length of time you have undoubtedly heard her tell one of the many stories of me talking in my sleep. Everyone always gets a good laugh over some of the crazy things that happen while I'm sawing logs.  Last night was a nice addition to the story repository.  I had gone to bed just before midnight. I wasn't in bed because I was tired, but because I have to be up and running by 6:30. Well, 1am rolls around and I'm still laying there wide awake and Ameliou is just heading to bed and she has no idea I'm still awake. So, I thought I would take advantage of situation and history. =)  It's pitch black, and she is crawling into bed and I hollar out "oohh ohh aaahh ahh" in as sinister voice I can muster. Her response was "what the heck was that for?". My response: silence. Then she realizes that I'm "sleeping" and starts questioning me. "Are you awake?" "You're sleeping aren't you?"  I couldn't keep it in anymore. I busted out laughing. And that kicked off the next 20 minutes of giggling and laughing together.   Living life with your best friend is magical. Goofy stuff like talking in your sleep become memories that last a lifetime.

      If you have been in near the Web design industry for more than 2 minutes, you're familiar with  urlLink Steve Krug's  book  Don't Make Me Think . It was published back in October, 2000. In Web/dog years, that's almost 28 years ago! A lot has changed in the Web industry since then, but why are companies all over the world still using this book as the "usability" bible? There are plenty of other resources available that are current and up-to-date. For example:   urlLink useit   urlLink designing with web standards   urlLink webpagesthatsuck   urlLink Usability   I think it hit me the other day as to why this book remains so popular. It was written with the title in mind. It's a book that doesn't go into a lot of detail, it has big pictures and cool illustrations. It was written for the average Web user. Wow, what a concept.  The crummy part is, that because it's usability-dumbed-down, every "CEO type" can understand it, and therefore uses it as  the  Web bible.  I guess it could be worse. I'm sure Al Gore would have like to written a usability mannual. After all, he  did  invent the Web.

      Well, I'm now 27 years old. Life is good.   I had a cuz tell me on my birthday that he thought I was 22. That was great! He also said that he thought one of our cousins was 25, when in reality this cuz is 5 years younger than me. It was awesome!   Anyway, I had a great birthday. People always make too much of a fuss over it though.   Amelia and I went over to Grand Haven yesterday to hang with our friends at Watermark. That was awesome! God has got some great things started with them. The youth there are out of this world. I love em all!   Amelia and I get to hang with some GREAT friends in Lansing in the morning. That will be awesome! We haven't seen these friends in FAR TOO LONG! It should be a good reunion!   OK, that's all for now. I have some cool thoughts and news to share in the next few weeks.

      Recent polls state that 80+% of Americans oppose same sex marriages. O.K., if that's what the people say, why aren't our elected officials representing us in government? Outraged.  So-called "republicans" that didn't vote for the FMA will get their come-upins! Sooner or later.

         If you have not done so,  urlLink click here . If you don't  urlLink click here , because you're too arrogant or ignorant and therefore refuse to do your part; don't talk to me. Yeah, I'm that narrow. If you don't like it, I really don't care.    What? I thought you Jesus followers were supposed to be non offensive.  Yes, I'm sure that's what you think Jesus followers are all about. Why? Because the liberal media doesn't tolerate anyone willing to stand for truth and righteousness. That's why you need to read this:   Hebrews 13:4 Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.  Matthew 19 4   And He answered and said, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE,  5   and said, FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?  6   "So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."  How does God feel about homosexuality? Leviticus 20:13 should give you an idea.  Wait, what about the New Testament?   It commonly is argued that Jesus never said a word about homosexuality. As our guide and model for life, we should follow Jesus’ example of silence. He taught, instead, that we should love one another in a non-judgmental way.   In response, it should be noted that Jesus’ silence on the issue is no argument that He approved of homosexuality. He never specifically addressed the issues of pedophilia, bestiality, or any number of other sexual perversions. Does this mean that Jesus approved of whatever He did not condemn by name? Are we to think that as long as people feel love, it doesn’t matter what they do? To ask is to answer. In fact, the Lord Jesus always spoke of sexual relations in heterosexual terms. What Jesus did say carries more weight than our views of what He did not say. Clearly, Jesus’ heterosexual view must be taken as normative (read Matthew 19:4-6 et al.).   -Apologetics Press   Yeah, I'm fired up about this! I'm not going to stand by and watch the most sacred covenant here on earth be molested by pagans.  O.K., it's your turn to stand up for what is right!  urlLink Make your voice count for the truth!

      Yeah, I'm still trying to learn the guitar. It's not coming as quick as I hoped. I think it's because I don't have anything to play. I just strum a bunch of cords, and make a bunch of noise. I think I'm going to need lessons. Ameliou and had lined up lessons for me in G.R., but we left before I started them, and I haven't looked for any down hear yet because money is tight. I have found a good site that has taught me a lot, but I need a little more than that. Someday!  Anyway, I listened to the next Maximum Impact lesson this weekend. I know it seems I only mention Maxwell when I disagree, but the guy has a lot of truth in him. (I wouldn't subscribe to him if he wasn't lagit.) This last lesson was on communication, which is a topic I LOVE. It was definitely worth the hour investment.  That's all for now...

      So, what have I been doing for the last week? I should have a TON of free time to do a lot of blogging right? AS IF! I realize that I take Ameliou for granted. She does a TON around here! Not only does she keep our home in top order, but she keeps min in order.  Don't worry about me though. I'm holding ground.  I'll be posting again in the morning. Good night...

      Amelia and I have been counting our blessings a lot lately. It seems the more we count them, the more there are to count. God has a sneaky way of making that happen. If you have not read Ameliou's blog yet, you can check out one of the coolest blessings yet.  I'm geeked. Stoked. Thrilled. Awed.  God has also been bringing a little more work to OPMG. Thanks to all of you who have been praying. Yall ROCK! I'll send out some URL's once they are live.  God is good... all of the time.

      I'm sure glad Amelia posts on a regular basis. If she didn't, I wouldn't have anything to read! No, I'm not pointing the finger at any of my blogging friends. I'm just as bad!  Does anyone know anybody at z88.3 in Orlando? Just thought I would check. =)  In other news; Amelia and I will be connecting with a design firm in St. Pete in the near future. They are looking for some outsourcing alternatives. They need a good writer (Amelia) and some funky Web work. I'm sure God has something good in store there.  That's all for now.
