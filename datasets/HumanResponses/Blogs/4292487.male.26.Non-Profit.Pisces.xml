      When it comes down to being a man around you I fall like the walls of Berlin What can I do To get next to you To make you laugh To make you smile Like when were children in the 80's Listening to punk and new wave  I could take your hand And show that I have what you are looking for Make this day last forever Make my breath stain the glass my finger delivers How about you?  The wheels are turning I have come to a complete stop And now I stand in front of you And I lost the power of speech What ever happened to me I used to be so cool But now I play myself the fool  And the world spins around this room The glare follows your shadow And to say I am here for only you  I have lost control Of my thoughts of my heart No more room for feeling sorry Story of my life

       The River Runs Red   Brush up on your history And educate yourself This life is repeating like a viscous cycle Youâ€™re caught in the path Be conscious of who you are You are about to be swept away Out of my reach So far so far away  Keep telling myself I am safe But there is no truth in the way I live I live with out making the mistake Of falling in love No not me, not again  I must not be weak I must not be afraid All I am has gone the way The way of the enemy I can not be your slave I must break free and live When it all comes down The rain will call your name And drown out the sorrowful tears And make you scream So far so far away  Keep telling myself I am safe But there is no truth in the way I live I live with out making the mistake Of falling in love No not me, not again  I keep telling myself I am safe That this is good the way it is Nothing to compare being alone to Just accept that life can be cruel And you will never fail at anything But your chances of success Are nothing compared to the shadow you cast And the farther you run No one can hear you scream  So far so far away

      So I have started my blog... If you are interested please read on, mostly I will tortue those who have choosen to read with my poor writing skills  and let those who wish to comment, do so.  You might run past the occassional blog about how baseball causes more stress in my life than woman and work combined.  I might even share my dreams with you, not girly dreams but my actual fall asleep dreams. They are often long strange and offer no insight into the real me, or do they?  Blog me baby,  Etnies
