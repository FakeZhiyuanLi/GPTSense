      here's a question. or, a bunch of questions my friends and I got to asking after a stroll around a park.  1) Are we pre-conditioned to liking or disliking something by the society, or is it due to our genes?  2) Just how much does the society affects us? and how far does our genes dictate our likes and dislikes?  the food we like, the songs we hear, acceptable and unacceptable behavior, just what, when and why we do the things we do daily. our concept of what God is.. in our genes? or our upbringing? did we come into this world pre-conditioned? faces and bodyshape, maybe, but the psychological side of us? what of it? if my grandad hated music, which is not likely, could it be that somewhere in me i'd have hated music too? the human ears constantly seek out lovely sounds.. but sometimes not. maybe i should rename this blog random thods.thoughts. ok. back on track. pretty deep questions, these. well, not that deep. but definitely warrants some deep talking.just how much do our genes dictate our psyche? society definitely does, that we all know. but there are studies that says that depressives could have inherited that particular trait from our parents or grandparents or great-great grandparents and so on and so forth.  kids by politicians may be pre-disposed to become politicians themselves, kids by lawyers vice-versa, kids by doctors, i know that i had inherited my love of books and writing from my dad and mum, or maybe because my parents were responsible for making me this way.. their encouragements, encouragements by my teachers and friends too play their part, so that takes care of society.  my bout with depression? hmm... this blog definitely ought to be renamed random thoughts.

NOT! ok. ultimate sarcasm. in case any of you thinks that i am against lawyers, i qualify as one, and i am NOT PRACTICING. so no legal advice shall be distributed by mua.many apologies.there ware way too many lawyers around anyway. gotta go. i'll write again soon.
