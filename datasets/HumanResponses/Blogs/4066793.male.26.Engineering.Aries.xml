      Ok, Kerry has truly lost touch, lets see this is what he wants to do. In a speech he gave today, he stated, if he was elected president and Usama was captured by US forces alive, he would make sure he got a fast and speedy trial here in the United States, where he would see that he was tried for the murders in NYC, Penn, and Washington DC. Wait a minute, I can here Johnny Cochran just beginning to count his money he would get from all the Usama sympathizers, hell he would probably try it pro-bono just to get the book deal, and his face all over the big screens across the world. But here is the case as it would unfold, Johnny would prove with out a doubt Usama was not on the planes, US intelligence is classified therefore not able to be used in court and completely circumstantial, and finally Usama was really misunderstood and suffered years of oppression from the west, it was our fault he turned out to be a fanatic, he really meant no harm in his statements to his underlings.   God what a moron, so here is the deal, if Usama is found, shoot him dead, cut of his head and air it every Arabic TV station.  below is the link to the article, just so everyone knows I am not making it up, and it is not a black helicopter theory, its not a Fox News site, or any other site of a vast right wing conspiracy, it is simply the AP.  urlLink http://apnews.myway.com/article/20040730/D845AAV00.html

      Ok, Kerry has taken every speech he has given to date and stuck them all together.&nbsp; It really is just a big anti-bush deal, I thought his goal was to appeal to the American people and tell us what he is going to do, how he is going to do it!&nbsp; Damn, I have heard more perspective arguments from my dad's neighbor's children, &nbsp;trying to get me to give them a can of pop.&nbsp;  When are they going to explain to us their plan for the war on terror, the economy, etc, I have heard nothing from these people, absolutely nothing!&nbsp; So here is what you get, JFK will do this smarter, he will make things better because he was in Vietnam, and the French will support him.&nbsp; Sigh, so here is the new slogan.&nbsp; KERRY 04, because he is not BUSH.   If I really cared I would actually line by line his crappy speech, but there is no substance here.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      So guess what, sometime last night, after watching the DNC I am sure, so low life varmint decide that our hammock we had outside was being neglected and decided to borrow it without returning it.&nbsp; Got to love AMERICA, since we are "rich" ie rich being defined as having something that other people don't have since the George Bush was unable to provide it, (note during the Clinton years theft most not have occurred because a democrat was in office.&nbsp; HOLD THE PHONE, this is a real time discovery, Emily (my girlfriend for those who don't know), went outside around behind our garage and discovered the varmint was unable to carry it over the fence that was bent over and left it there to rest, so it looks like we are going to have to throw some razor wire back there to deal with the problem.&nbsp; Damn, maybe not, because if I do that, and an unexpecting criminal happens to cut himself (or herself, gotta be PC, not gender biased), then its my fault and I will get sued by a lawyer much like the kind of lawyer John Edwards.&nbsp; So whats the next step, cops in my neighborhood will not patrol (station says they need to get more tickets written for speeding, catching thieves and deterring crime only costs the station house money ).&nbsp; What next, maybe I should sit in my back yard with a large assault rifle and just "defend my property", at any rate cops are useless since they don't patrol, everyone knows there is not a police presence anywhere, so what better thing to do.&nbsp; Note this is not an isolated incident, before I moved in, and we were living out of my apartment, we had some nice kind soul, kick down our door, just a few weeks ago another nice individual borrowed my gas grill (with out returning it).&nbsp; So what to DO!   &nbsp;

      Ok, I got sick and tired of sending out email spam of random political rants.&nbsp; So, I took my friends advice and started my own blog.&nbsp; Not that I am expecting to many people to actually waste their time and effort on reading this thing, but hey I might as well put it up for my own sanity.&nbsp; So sit back, reply, enjoy, hate it, praise, ignore it, I personally don't care, but at least I have a place to vent.&nbsp;   here is a quick link to a Ray's blog, enjoy his law school rants:&nbsp;   urlLink http://www.raymond42.blogspot.com/   &nbsp;

      YAAAAAAWWWNNNNNNN  is about all I can really say when thinking about it.&nbsp; Hell, even Dan Rather thinks this is so boring. So what happened to the conventions?&nbsp; Once upon a time, the conventions was a place where all the delegates of each state would sort through pressing issues of the time and nominate the person they see fit, now what is it, a freaking joke!&nbsp; All they do is put on there pretty hats, censor all the speeches to be more "moderate" and less anti-Bush.&nbsp; The entire world has known for months that Kerry is the democrats guy, why waste all the money, why shut down an entire city for absolutely nothing, and don't get me wrong this all will directly apply to the RNC as well.&nbsp; The legitimacy is long gone of these things, I am not sure why they even cover it, hell on Monday, with all the heavy hitters, both Clintons, Al Gore etc speaking, nobody watched and it was on every channel, expect for one, where a lone rerun of CSI:Miami was on, which according to the ratings, everyone was watching.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Another quick note, these people don't care about Kerry, Edwards, Al Gore, the Clintons, in fact the only time people there get excited is the few Anti-Bush statements that were permitted by the DNC.&nbsp; Did anyone else notice that 1/2 the seats there was unfilled, even when Bill and Hillary was speaking?&nbsp; Kinda strange for a big time convention, maybe they where trapped in a cage match in the Free Speech Zone!

      Yes, my neighbor's rule! Ok, so this family up the street from my house was letting their kids play in their pick up truck (with the keys) which is parked on the street. So guess what, as if you didn't already know, the car was placed into neutral and rolled and crushed another car a few houses down that is also parked on the street. So, guess whose fault this accident was, was it the neighbor's down the street who should not have parked their car on the street? Was it the children in the car who the parents gave them the keys to the truck? Or was it the parents of the kids who allowed their kids to play in the truck that rolled and crushed the other neighbor's truck on the street? I am guessing NONE OF THE ABOVE, it really is the fault of President George W Bush, since he has failed to provide education to our kids. It is more likely the fault of Halliburton and Dick Cheney as well, its all a conspiracy, had Bush been on top of things he would make sure those children were safe, he would make sure they knew how to drive the vehicle before getting into it, had he properly passed legislation to do so this would not have happened, in fact GW should write my neighbor's a check tonight. Hopefully John Edwards won't get wind of this, he may attempt to sue the city for not putting in safety devices on the street, as well as suing the manufacture of the truck, since the truck should not be able to go into drive or neutral with the key in the ignition...How FREAKING ABSURD!!!!

      Yet Neil continues with a great addition of Neil Nuze at  urlLink www.boortz.com  read and enjoy:   One of the centerpieces of the Democratic stump speech these days has been that 'Bush lied.'  The loony left likes to say that Bush 'misled the country.'  I've been trying for months now to get just one caller to tell my vast (but not vast enough) audience just what lie Bush told us.  So far, no luck.  It's a lot easier to run around saying that Bush lied than it is to actually come up with an example*. Still, even thought mountains of evidence, along with two reports by the British and United States governments, exonerate the president, it's still a rallying cry for the left.  In case you come across one of these weirdoes, let's examine the evidence.David Kay, the leader of the Iraq Survey Group, speaking about the intelligence said there was "no sign that the administration pressured analysts."  Then there was the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee which completely absolved the administration of any lying.  Over in Great Britain, something called The Butler Report found no evidence that Prime Minister Tony Blair misled anyone.  Then, there's the 9/11 Commission, which found that the administration was misled by a flawed intelligence network.  And finally, even Hans Blix himself said who said "I don't think they acted in bad faith."So why do people keep repeating the fantasy that "Bush lied?"  Because their hatred of George W. Bush is so deep, they fail to see the facts (something liberals don't like anyway.)Next time somebody tells you Bush lied, ask them to prove it.  They won't be able to. *Remember, a statement can only be a lie if you knew that statement to be untrue at the time you made it.  If I tell you that I'm going to take Paul's phone call right after the break, and Paul hangs up during the break, I can't be tagged with a lie.

      Thank you Neil Boortz, I couldn't have said this better: Its long, but is a MUST read!   THIS YOU MUST REMEMBER ABOUT JOHN KERRY'S TAX PLANS John Kerry is announcing, rather proudly in fact, that he intends to raise taxes ... but only on those people in this country who are making more than $200,000 a year.  This idea is quite popular with an alarmingly large number of (stupid/envious) Americans.  I'm going to explain why this is a bad idea.  To most of my listeners I offer this apology for the slow, plodding way I am going to go about this.  The problem is that most of the people who realize that Kerry's tax increases are dangerous already understand what I'm going to tell you.  Those who think it's a great idea were probably educated in government schools.  That's why I have to take this slow.  These folks aren't the easiest people to educate. OK ... first of all, on the campaign trail Kerry will usually chose his words carefully.  He will say that he wants to raise taxes only on "people earning more than $200,000 a year."  He intends for you to believe that he's talking about individuals here; individuals earning more than two hundred grand a year.  But Kerry didn't say "individuals."  He'll say "people" or "Americans."  The secret here is that married couples fit under the definition of "people" and "Americans."  Kerry's tax-increase plans include any couple reporting more than $200,000 in income on a joint tax return.  So, you may be making $85,000 a year, and your wife or husband may be making $120,000 a year, and you think you've escaped Kerry's tax increase.  Sorry!  File that joint return and join the club! Now ... just who are these people earning more than $200,000 a year?  Sure, some of them are salaried individuals or commissioned sales weasels ... but a lot of them are small business owners.  In fact, a huge percentage of them are small business owners.  To be more specific ... a huge percentage of these people are the very small business owners our economy depends on for well over 75% of all jobs. These small business owners are operating their businesses under such legal structures as a Subchapter-S Corporation or an LLC, a Limited Liability Corporation.  These legal structures allow these individuals to operate their businesses with most of the legal protections afforded regular corporations, but without some of the more onerous accounting and financial requirements.  These Sub-S and LLC business owners do not file corporate tax returns.  All of their business earnings are reported on their personal tax returns as personal income.  So, if you're running a dry cleaner, a restaurant or manufacturing company; if you're a doctor, lawyer or dentist; if you own a construction company or any other small  business as a Sub-S or LLC you will report the earnings from that company on your personal tax return.  You can see that it won't take much at all for your income to exceed the magic Kerry-targeted $200,000.  Now just what happens when you raise the income taxes on these $200,000 + income earners?  Come on now.  I know you went to government schools ... but you can see the effect here, can't you?  You're not really raising an individual's taxes, you're raising taxes on a business.  These small business owners turn over to the government in taxes the money they could be using to expand!  Why do they want to expand their businesses?  Because the more business they do, the more money they make!  To do more business they may need more employees!  But if the government is taking more of their earnings, then there is less money available to hire new employees or purchase equipment that is needed for business expansion! This is why you see economic growth following tax cuts.  Sure, the extra money in the pockets of individual taxpayers doesn't hurt ... but the real growth comes from small business owners using their tax savings to expand their businesses by purchasing new equipment and hiring new people! Does Kerry understand all this?  Two weeks ago I would have told you that he understands it all-too-well.  Today, I'm not so sure.  After all, just last week I interviewed a congressman from Detroit, John Conyers, who didn't even know that American corporations have to pay federal income taxes to our federal government for earnings realized solely from overseas operations.  So, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that Kerry might be as dumb as most other Americans on this issue. I'm going to make the assumption, though, that The Poodle knows who these people are he wants to hit with a tax increase, and he knows what the effect will be.  He knows, but he doesn't give a damn.  For Kerry, it's all about power.  He knows that the vast majority of Americans couldn't write a coherent sentence about the tax treatment of Sub-S and LLC small businesses.  He knows that when he talks up a tax increase on "Americans making more than $200,000 a year" that most people create a mental image of some high-roller somewhere simply getting a $10,000 paycheck every two weeks.  The voters Kerry is after know that they'll never see a paycheck like that, and by God they want to punish those evil people who do.  After all, they're only making that kind of money because they've cheated someone else or because they have crooked lawyers.  They're not really working people like us, are they?  They just sit around all day polishing their Benz and sipping Chardonnay.  Those $200,000 a year types were just lucky.  After all, didn't Richard Gephardt say that they were the ones who "won life's lottery?"  And don't they call us the "less fortunate?" So, if you happen to be on the fence in this election, here's your question.  Do you want these small business owners to keep that money and spend it on business expansion, or do you want the government to take it and spend it on who-knows-what in some congressman's district to help him buy some votes? If there was any decent economic education in our pitiful government schools we wouldn't be discussing this right now.

      Mr. Kerry in your speech and speech's that followed the DNC you make statements that we need affordable healthcare, strong environmental polices, a smarter war on terror, along with a lot of other claims. Now my question is that you have been a senator for many years. None of the things you have stated are "new ideas" for voting issues, but why have you never proposed any legislation in the past 20 years to solve these problems? Where is your healthcare bill, your environmental bill, your legislation to wage a smarter war. I would think it would be your duty as a senator to propose as much legislation that can help the war on terror, since it affects both republicans and democrats, but yet no legislation, just rhetoric that Bush is not doing a good job? Enlighten the American people, let us know what YOU are going to do.

      Well, John Kerry has finally unveiled his plan, but the catch is that its a Secret. He has made claims he has cards he can play with heads of states that will allow us to move our troops out and get full international support. I am interested for a senator who wants what's best for the world, he sure hasn't proposed any legislation on this issue in the senate, but that's ok, we know he does truly have a plan, to bad we can't compare it to Bush's because its all hush hush.

      Ok, last night Emily and I saw "The Village".  If you have not already seen it, don't.  Its god awful.  I wish I could get my 2 hours of my life back that I lost watching that horrid film.  The twist is predictable, and not very shocking.  I am not going to spoil the movie, but it was slow going and boring, I give it negative 5 stars.
