      I suppose I should have started off this weblog for those of you who read it by telling a little bit about myself. I am from the state of West Virginia, in fact I am 5th generation. I currently reside in WV, but dont start thinking things about me just from that information. I grew up out in the mountains and (what the locals call it) up a holler. I am the oldest of 4 children. I have a brother and two twin sisters. I was homeschooled by my parents until 7th grade. My brother and sisters were homeschooled nearly as long. I did not watch TV growing up but I read a lot, which I think was healthier. My parents tried to shelter me and let me grow up without much peer pressure. I am thankful for this. I may write more about my homeschooling experiences one day. When I went to school it was private Christian schools. In fact, I did not attend my first public school until graduate school. I went to a small Christian school in TN called King College and graduate school was East Tennessee State University. I got somewhat rebellious and wild in my first couple years of school, but turned all that around my junior year. I consider my self to be a Christian, but as we all our I am still a sinner. I will write more about my religious views and thoughts through out this log.   I worked for a year as an accountant in TN, then over a year as a insurance and financial planner in TN. I then moved my business to WV to utilize key relationships. After running my business in West Virginia for a year I was then offered to come and help a start up internet consulting company. After much prayer and deliberation I took the offer. I am now the Vice President of Operations and Finance for a start up company. I love the title it is such an ego boost, but I do the work. It is a lot of risk and a great challenge. I am sure I will be writing a lot about my first experience in building a business. I actually cant wait to say I am the Vice President of a successful internet consulting company. I have always loved working so I am glad that there is a lot of work to do. I actually work over 70 hours a week. I figure while I am young and single I had better take advantage of my time and energy. So, here I am in a nutshell. I am a West Virginian, American, financially literate, business owner, single, young guy.

        Here is the last game of chess I have played. It was with a very good Russian friend of mine and this is the closest I have come to beating him.  I believe that I made three bad mistakes.   The fourth pawn move I made was meant to only move one not two.  The second was with my knight.  The last was with my pawns at the very end.    1.	 e4	 g6 2.	 d4	 d6 3.	 Nf3	 b6 4.	 c4	 Bb7 5.	 Nb-d2	 Nf6 6.	 Bd3	 Bg7 7.	 b4	 O-O 8.	 O-O	 c5 9.	 Bb2	 cxb4 10.	 Rb1	 Bh6 11.	 Re1	 Bxd2 12.	 Nxd2	 e6 13.	 d5	 Qe7 14.	 f4	 Nb-d7 15.	 Nf3	 Rf-e8 16.	 e5	 exd5 17.	 exf6	 Qd8 18.

      I was just surfing the internet.  Found this thought it would be an interesting place to write down my thoughts of the day, and keep track of them.  I don't know exactly what thoughts I will focus on writing here.  I know it won't be all of them, maybe just a few specific types of thoughts.  (Laughing) A theme...hmmm...  Well, I guess I'll see.  First, lets see how this works.  Well, If I never post again.  It means I didn't figure out how to use this...

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to New York City a few days ago.&nbsp; I just went for a weekend.&nbsp; I had not been since I was a little kid.&nbsp; I just thought I would about it.&nbsp; I flew up Friday afternoon arrived downtown via cab around 6:00Pm.&nbsp; I ate at one of the best restaurants I have ever experienced, Azaleas (not sure about the spelling).&nbsp; Then I attended a decent Broadway play called "Mama Mia!".&nbsp; It was an ok musical play.&nbsp; All the music from the play was by ABBA and it was entertaining.&nbsp; Then after the Broadway play I went to a comedy club.&nbsp; Carolines Comedy Club was highly recommended and I had a great time there.&nbsp; I saw Rudy Rush (I think that was his name) I was kind of drunk by this time because I had been drinking since I arrived.&nbsp; The lady that hosted the show sucked, but the opening act, some guy by the name of Theo, was absolutely hilarious.&nbsp; From what I remember Rudy Rush was funny, too.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day I got up very early and walked 40 blocks to the Rose Space and Science Museum.&nbsp; It wasn't extremely impressive, although, it was worth it.&nbsp; They have an awesome planetarium type thing which you can take a journey through the universe and it is narrated by Tom Hanks that one show made the entire museum worth it.&nbsp; Then I walked across Central Park to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&nbsp; I grabbed a bite to eat at a little deli&nbsp;and then&nbsp;went into the&nbsp;Met.&nbsp; I thoroughly enjoyed this museum and wish I had had more time to spend there.&nbsp; Although, I do like the National Art Gallery in DC better then the Met, but the Met has my new favorite painting.&nbsp; It is a painting of "Joan of Arc" by Jules Bastien-Lepage.&nbsp;   Here is the Picture...   Well, can't figure out how to post pictures yet.&nbsp; Here is the link.    urlLink http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOnezoom.asp?dep=11&amp;zoomFlag=0&viewmode=1&amp;item=89%2E21%2E1    I loved that picture and found it to be very moving.   So, then I left the Met and walked to Rockefeller Square and got a picture of the Atlas Statue, which I love.&nbsp; (If you want to know why I love the Atlas Statue read the book "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand)&nbsp; Then I had to buy something from Macy's so I went there and shopped for a couple of hours.&nbsp; Five floors of men's clothing so it was hard to pick out just one shirt.&nbsp; I bought two.&nbsp; Then I went shopping at some other places and by this time it was dinner time.&nbsp; So I ate at a decent steak house, can't remember its name, but it was famous.&nbsp; I think the steak house was way over priced for only an average meal and average service.&nbsp; Then I went to another Broadway play.&nbsp; Golda's Balcony which was a very good drama.&nbsp; After the play I went to a jazz club.&nbsp; Birdland I had a decent time, but felt that $30 dollars was a lot to pay for only 30 minutes of a show.&nbsp; They didn't tell me the band had been play for over an hour already and was almost finished.&nbsp; I asked them about this and they didn't&nbsp; really seem to care, but I don't think I'd visit that jazz club again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now, where am I?&nbsp; Ok, so now it is Sunday my last day.&nbsp; I visited Soho and Tribeca, but only briefly.&nbsp; Visited Ground Zero, talk about an emotional place.&nbsp; It was very strange to visit there and stand on the ground that so many people had died in a mere instant.&nbsp; I was very motivated after visiting the site, and decided to work even harder in my daily life.&nbsp; If there is anything I can do to give the terrorist the bird it is to work harder then before and build an even stronger, wealthier, more powerful nation.&nbsp; I visited Wall Street, the NYSE, took lots of pictures, and returned to my hotel to pack.&nbsp; Before I left NYC, I ate at a fabulous Brazilian Restaurant Viva Brasil, I would recommend it to anybody.&nbsp; It was awesome and well priced.&nbsp; Be careful with the hot pepper sauce though, it is good but very very spicy....  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I flew home...What an awesome weekend.&nbsp; In fact, I would love to live in NYC one day.&nbsp; If I ever get the chance I will jump on it.    &nbsp;
