      I received a call yesterday from an IT recruiter.  The guy said he has been hanging onto my resume since I applied for one of their jobs last November via monster.  He said I was exactly what this large wireless company is looking for to fill a position for QA.  RAD!  The job pays about $15000 more a year than this place, and its a more reputable company.  Considering the place I'm at now just laid off about 20 people, I said I could start Monday.  I haven't had an interview yet though, so I'm not getting my hopes up too much.  But if it happens, I'll be having to figure something out with where to live.  Because this new place is around San Diego.  And since that's where my closest friends are, you can imagine my excitement of the prospects.  T wrote me again today wanting to see me tomorrow night.  I told him in more words "you don't seem to be accessible enough for what I need."    Oh, and about last weekend...  D msged me Monday night saying 'thanks for your concern, I'm sorry I worried you.' Then he called and we talked for a bit.  He says he left his phone in his friends car Friday, and didn't get it back till Monday night when they guy came home from out of town or something.  I told him he needs to make it up to me anyways.  I'm not back to completely trusting him, so don't worry.  But there are some issues that he's dealing with that I can't really discuss with anyone.  And reading what I've been saying about him, makes me feel a bit guilty and selfish.  I haven't been fair, and since this is solely my outlet, his side doesn't have a chance to defend... which I don't mind :D  but I need to clear it up for my own conscience.  He is trying, and I am impatient.  We talked about that too, and he still maintains my innocence, while I still maintain his guilt.  Its a vicious circle =P  So he might come up this weekend with A and J, and we are all going to go watch Troy in a big theatre.  I'm really looking forward to us all spending time together.  That's Friday.  Saturday two girls from northern cali are coming down to visit.  I met them the first week of this job.  For training, they flew me up there (my first day on the job was spent in a plane, and office I won't work at, and the comfiest bed at the Sheraton).  They work at this office that the company I work for owns, and they were the funnest.  They took me out my third day there, and we all got stupid drunk.  Its my turn to return the favor.  So Saturday we are going to go drink at the beach bars down the street from my place (4 block walk..er stagger home) and then they crash in my living room.  So this weekend will be a welcome antithesis of the last.  Speaking of drunkenness.... my roommate brought home 4 bottles of absinthe that he ordered from Amsterdam.  Real stuff he says, wyrmwood/wormwood (however you want to spell it) and all.  I had two glasses worth (small glasses mind you), and was a tiny bit sloppy by 9.  I was sober by 11, and slept great.  No hangover either.  We only tried two brands though, so tonight I think he wants to finish the 'sampling'.  With all this, it looks to like it will be the most I've drank in a very long time.  I hope I'm up for it.

      I'm so glad the weekend was over, now if we can just get this week to go by pronto, things will be peachy.  No matter how long its been since my relationship with the Ex was ending, we still have some sort of anger with eachother.  This became evident when I called him saturday to work out a time to go through stuff.  He turned on the charm within a minute of the conversation. "What exactly did you hope to accomplish today?"  um... yea, I thought we discussed this at E3?  I said I would be there, we could go through the stuff, and I could start getting my part of it out of there.  "Well, what time... 5? That's a bit late isn't it?" ok, so would you rather do this tomorrow Ex? "um, yeeeaaa.. see I already have plans tomorrow, so that's just not going to work" (I hope I'm getting the snottyness across).  We agreed on 3:30, and within 10 minutes of me ranting about it to my best friend A, I text messaged him "lets just do this some other time".  Now, normally I would have just got it over with, bit the bullet, and hurried the hell out of there.  But this time, I had other issues drawing on my patience and mental stability....like D.  Haven't heard from D since Friday morning.  He said he wasn't feeling well (had worked a 24 hour shift the night before and hadn't slept yet.  For about a month now, he has been getting some pretty bad dizzy spells for no reason.  I attributed these to him working so goddamn much, and not getting any rest.  He worked well over 20 days straight, and at least 16 hour days).  So I didn't expect to hear from him till saturday.  But that never happened.  So I asked my friend J (who is one of my closest friends and also A's boyfriend) if he could confirm for me that D is alive.  He said no, D called in sick.  He has a side business with another guy who works there, who called in sick today too.  So its obvious that they are working on the other business today, and D isn't really sick (which yea, I'm glad to hear. But I messaged him a few times asking if he was ok.  He never responded).  After talking about with J, it became clear that I need to move on.  Lets just hope that I am strong enough to keep to that.  Because no matter how many times D and I have some weirdness pop up, I seem to forgive and understand more than Jesus would deem practical.  (he says I'm an angel, or that I'm pure)In no way am I a saint  (probably just naive or a less flowery version of that, like 'stupid'). I do care a lot for the boy, but fuck I'm pissed off.  You just don't let people worry about you like that.  You can't just stop talking to someone for no known reason.  So my last message to him will be "I hope that you learn to like yourself more.  Otherwise, being alone again will be even more unpleasant."  T messaged me this morning "good morning.... was thinking of you all weekend.... when can I see you?"  .....  I need a new batch of testosterone to deal with here.

      T IMed me at work earlier. "when can I see you?".  My reply was "I don't know, I thought you wanted to do something Wednesday, but you never got a hold of me." As I assumed he would, he went on about how busy he's been. "deadlines to meet" blah blah.  He says he wants to do something next week, but I'm thinking I might just tell him not to bother.  I don't want to lead him on, and I have some strong feelings for D.    This weekend should be interesting.  If I hear from D soon, I might head to San Diego tonight and spend some time with him.  Which would make this trip much more enjoyable than it would be just seeing the ex.  UGH I reeeeaaally am dreading tomorrow.  Going through a few years of stuff that we shared or mixed.  He's a philosopher type, and I'm sure that he's going to try to re-hash things that are best left 7 months behind us.  It wasn't a pretty break-up.  There was a bit of spying on me via my computer. (NOTE: if you share a network with a computer engineer, make sure to check administrative rights on your system after things go sour with said engineer.  And whatever you do, do not agree to play an RPG hosted on his box if you don't check your system)  I know we are going to argue on a few items.  No matter what, I better come home with the domino set my brother bought us for christmas a few years back. (unfortunately it has "nicnivin & Ex's Bones" engraved on it.)((with the proper names of course))  Today for lunch, my coworker/friend B and I went to get our nails done.  We decided, its friday, payday, end of a crazy work week.... we need the spa chair pedicure too.  I hate being that girl no matter how good it feels.  I'm sitting there sipping my triple venti soy toffeenut latte, getting a "pedi and a mani" done, while gossiping with B and 5 other of 'those type' girls.  ugh.  I hate it, because you almost fall into the roll while you're there.  And I am not the kind of person who is completely quiet and to themselves in public.  I'll talk to others next to me, make bad jokes, etc.. the whole time though, I feel like I'm watching someone else.  Its not really me, that's my public person taking over, and I'm really just hanging in the background feeling embarrassed by the bad jokes my public person decided to throw at this poor unsuspecting girl in the neighboring spa pedicure chair.  And the point where I know I've said something dumb, or not really having to do with the topic of conversation, is when they reply "There you go.".  Wow I hate that phrase. (and this isn't the first time I've ranted about it, which really shows [I think] that I am justified when I mention how much I truly despise this phrase).  I just looked at the clock.  I'm off in a few minutes, so I should go wrap some issues up.  well, there ya go.

      When I started this, I was going to be more anonymous about it.  But I really don't want to keep two blogs, one for my friends.  Besides I hope that I don't censor myself as it is, and maybe this will keep me in that mind-set.  I hate having hidden parts of myself, especially with the people I am close to.  It seems unhealthy, and if I had to hide something about myself, I would probably start to think that that thing is a problem.  There's a fine line between being open and being an attention whore in my opinion.  Its all on how someone interprets it I suppose.  It would be a lie to say that by posting my thoughts/desires/fears on here, I am not wanting someone to read it.  But its not for validation.  That's where I think I would go from being open to attention whore.  So I guess I'm saying all this to validate my decision of not keeping it completely anonymous.  Does that make me a contradiction? ooooh no, now I'm asking you to validate my questioning of my validation!   *head asplode*

      Since E3 was last week, and I haven't posted my pics anywhere else... Below are a few of my favorite displays this year.  I am holding of on posting any with me in them, because I haven't asked my friends who are also in the pics if they mind.    E3 was good fun, but a bit of a let down.  I am a CounterStrike junkie.  So naturally I was excited for HalfLife2.  Unfortunately they had the same type of set up as last year, where you had to wait in line for 30-50 minutes to get in and see the demo.  Now, last year I was more forgiving of this.  But after they missed the release date (grumble grumble) I couldn't believe they were pulling the same shit this year.  Now I didn't wait in line last year, and I wasn't very keen on the idea this year either.  I'll be damned if I'm going to waste an hour of my one day at E3 (that's all I can ever get off for it) waiting in a line to have someone advertise at me.    All around it seemed a bit toned down this year.  I have this horrid fear of the game industry becoming dull, and E3 seems to be heading in that direction.   Really though, I still love it.  I get to see old co-workers, friends, and this year I ran into my ex.  We hadn't seen eachother for about 7 months, and the last time we spoke it was on instant messenger 5 months ago.  So it was a bit awkward to say the least.  The crazy part about it was it was on May 13th (which was our anniversary).  We didn't even realize it till a few days later. But I still have boxes in his garage that we have to go through.  That's part of my weekend plans, and I'm not really looking forward to it.    So T never called, and I got into CS (counterstrike) for most of the night.  Maybe its for the best.  But it will be interesting to hear what he has to say tomorrow.  Speaking of tomorrow, thats approaching fast.  Time to put my pillow to good use.

      When I try to explain my love life to someone, I'm seized with apprehension.  Either I always feel like talking about it makes it more dramatic than it is, or that they were really just trying to make conversation and I'm giving them way more information than they were going after in the first place.  Questioning my own motives has become a staple of my behavioral diet.  Currently I am emotionally attached to a boy we'll call D.  Now, D and I used to work together at a game company (he still works there).  We became good friends around the last 4 months of my employment there.  At the time, there was something growing between us that only I tried to investigate.  This ended as a bit of a let down when I asked what he wanted with me.  Just friends.  Ouch.  So I gave up, but became increasingly frustrated when we would randomly spend the night together (although we never took things that far).  When a boy says he just wants to be friends and then kisses you, you start to think that he is looking for a physical arrangement only.  This was my thought for a few minutes, till I remember that he is the one who always slows things down when we are together.    Fast forward about 8 months, and we get to the present status.  He is trying.  After many nights of talking about what ever it is that is going on, a few facts have emerged.  He digs me.  He also doesn't like the person he is in some respects.  I am the only person who doesn't listen to his 'front' and charges through it to carve out the truth behind his masks.  This does two things; pisses him off to no end, and makes him happy.  His major flaw is he is about as stubborn as I am.  He is dead set on buying a house ASAP, and will work himself sick to do so.  While that's admirable to a point, it sucks when you're the one who wants to hang out with him.  Finally I should add, that I moved to a different city before we really became closer and he wanted to try with me.  Now we live 120 miles from each other.  This will be the cause for a few posts in the future in which I will be bitching about the lack of time we spend together when I come to town and he's busy with work.    We have never said that we are seeing each other, or taken on titles like boyfriend & girlfriend.  And because of the inconsistency of what he wants with me, I have not given up on the potential of another.  I don't want another really, but I'm not blind to possibility.  So I'm meeting up with a guy tonight, who I have only known for a few weeks.  We'll call him T, and we'll assume (because its true) that he is interested in more than just being friends.    Now comes my moral hesitancy.  Is it cheating to go out with a man who I know is interested?  Or because things with D are in this weird limbo (and have been for the past 4 months), am I clear to do this without any sort of betrayal.  And is that view a cop out?  I am sure that I will have more clarity on that tomorrow morning. =P

      While I feel narcissistic by starting this, I need more ventilation in my life.  I've lived a fun, sort of unique life so far.....  Recently, its gone into slow motion bullet time mode with out the fun of bullets and acrobatics.  Starting when I was 19, I've worked in the television industry, moved on to the TV/Game industry when I was 22, and after 8 months just dropped the TV part all together and started playing games for a living.  Testing games was fun, but redundant and not as fulfilling as having tasks to challenge your brain.  And trying to find all the blueprints to create a weapon for your car isn't exactly a challenge when you play the game for 5 months.  Right now I don't do anything like that for a job, but of course there's more money in no-fun jobs.  I'm internal support for multiple background checking/pre-employment screening companies (which are all owned by this huge corporation that acquires a new business at least once a week).  The most fun I have at this job is when I see the scandalous details of someone's criminal background.  I can't publish any of this information though, so what fun is that?  So what is going to be interesting enough to keep a blog*?  I'm on a one way road to findanewjobville, with a few pit stops at kink city, and Up&DownRelationshipburgh (population: enough).  I figure between all that and my geekness, I should have enough material for a proper blog session.  *If ever in doubt, please refer to the title.

      Ok, so I was M.I.A. for a few, sorry bout that.  I ended things with D completely.  For a while he was being awesome.  He was getting into my kinks really well, and we were having a great time and getting closer.  Then he just pulled the disappearing act again.  So I wrote him a big ole fuck off letter and wiped hands on pants.  Its been sort of rough dealing with it, because I was at a point where I was thinking the L word (not lesbian).  On the other hand, an old flame came into the picture with his excellent timing.  K and I were seeing each other before I started my 2+ years with the Ex.  When we met, K and I were sort of in this 'not sure where this is going, but the sex is great' state.  And it didn't last long, because I went on a date with the Ex, and we were together since.  And I think K was all in love with someone else too.  So now we are both single again, and we met up saturday night for the first time in 3 years.  We had kept contact randomly since we stopped seeing each other, with IMs, emails, and a few calls. The attraction to him was still there when we saw eachother.  He has longer hair now, and it gets me.  He came by my apartment after going to see his friends band play, and by the time he got there it was about 1am.  So we hung-out, talked and tried to compare memories of what went on 3 years ago with us.  The sexual tension was pretty incredible.  We decided to wait for a bit before doing anything (he had to work at like 8am the next morning, and if we started anything, there would not be any sleep). Plus it gives us a chance to really evaluate it all.  He's good about these things.  I forgot how good he was with these things, and how blunt he can be.  It always took me by surprise, and forced me to say things I might otherwise try to get around.  I love that, having someone push you past your own walls.  So we parted with a hug, and we will probably hang out later this week..... I can't wait. =)  So yea, back to the blogging, promise!  I am still learning to vent with this, and I should have used it last week when I was dealing with the D situation.  I just sort of shut down, and closed up.  No more of that!
