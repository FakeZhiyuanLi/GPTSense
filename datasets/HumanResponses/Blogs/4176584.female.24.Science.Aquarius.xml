       Do you know who's gay? My state governor in NJ. He resigned giving this big speech about how he was gay and something about sexual harassment. It's so weird. His wife was standing next to him the whole time during his speech. She looked like either she was going to cry or laugh, I wasn't sure which. Imagine being a woman married to a man who decides to go public, on tv, to announce that he's gay. I would personally feel pretty gross knowing that my husband was out having sex with a guy then would come home and have sex with me after. What I don't understand is that he was married twice. Didn't he feel guilty after the first marriage? Some people close to him have said that they knew he was gay for a long time now. I wonder....      Anyway, I was really mad about something that happened at work the other day. This guy that I work with said something totally stupid. I already didn't like him too much to begin with and what he said to me just made me want to punch him really hard in the face (which I didn't do since I'd probably get in trouble). Somehow we started talking about tax breaks. He felt that it was wrong to get tax breaks just for having children. I disagree with this but I was fine with that since I know people have different oppinions and all. (But usually people who get that extra money put it towards raising their kids.. is there something wrong with that?)  But then he said something about poor people should choose not to have kids because they don't have money to take care of them. And that's when I started to get a little annoyed because it's not one of those choices you can make (like buying a blue or red shirt). Then he said.. "sure it's a choice, like if I'm poor I'm not gonna go out and buy an expensive sports car". WHAT!!!! He compared the choice of having kids to the choice of buying a car! I don't know if it's me but that just didn't sound right. You can't compare having kids to having a car. I tried to explain that sometimes poor people want kids too and even if they decide they don't want children it can happen by accident.  Then he thought that the woman should go on birth control or use condoms and that marriage should change things like that (you know, like not wearing condoms).  Then he went on a tangent in saying that people who get married get irresponsible and not use birth control.  What?  I thought we were talking about tax breaks.  Either he doesn't value people too much or he over-values cars. He then said "people have a choice, why 'choose' to have children when you can't afford it". I was a little speechless and at this point wanted to do things that would cause him pain. Then he said "well, we'll just have to agree to disagree", what a DORK!!      Anyway, I left the room before I said anything stupid. Then I talked with one of my other coworkers. He agreed with me 100%. We agreed that he has to be an only child who grew up in a family with no money problems and is spoiled. Someone who grew up in a household with money problems would definetly appreciate the tax break. I went home that night and thought about it. There are probably lots of people who think like that. Maybe it's because I grew up with no so much money where my mom couldn't afford anything but food and rent. Or maybe it's because I have some weird thinking that materials (such as cars) and human life can't be compared at that level. Then that's when I stated thinking of all the stuff I could have said to him to let him know how stupid he sounded but that always happens. Too late. I decided not to talk to him about anything other than work. If he brings anything up that I don't agree with, I'll just ignor it. But you know what? It still makes me pissed off!

      Why is it so hard to fall asleep?  I lay in bed waiting and waiting and waiting.  Then nothing happens.  I just keep laying there.  Sunday night I fell asleep after taking Tylenol PM.  That was my last resort, I was trying to fall asleep for over 2 hours!  I only got 4 hours of sleep then had to work all day.  Last night I thought that I'd fall asleep easy because I was so tired.  Nope.  Same thing.  Somehow I fell asleep though around 2am and woke up late again at 7.  At least I got 5 hours in.   Is there something I'm missing here?  I'm just bad at falling asleep.  I tried little things like counting sheep, trying to picture cartoons in my head, trying to not think of anything (which by the way doesn't work), and I also tried not moving at all to see if that was it.  No luck.  Last week I tried sleeping pills (they were blue and scary looking).  That definetly helped me sleep but I woke up all of a sudden at 5am for no reason.  It didn't feel like I slept at all.  I looked it up online to see what this Diphenhydramine HCl was.  It's basically a form of antihistamine (allergy medicine).  That just makes you drowsy and pass out.  So who decides what insomnia is?  How do they really test if you have insomnia?  Do I have it?  Or is it something normal that no one really talk about?

       I'm gonna write about this even if it happened a month ago because it's worth mentioning. On July 10th I surprised my boyfriend, Paul, by taking him sky diving for his birthday. I told him we were going hiking in the Pocono's. The days leading up to it were kinda scary since I couldn't act nervous. I'm afraid of heights (and no, sky diving didn't change anything). I get dizzy and feel like I'm gonna pass out when I look down from a 3 story building, imagine me up in a plane..    Anyway, we got there, he was surprised, and I was about to die. They made us sign all these papers saying how we're giving up legal rights and I can't sue them if I die. I don't think I'd do that especially since I'd be dead. I decided not to read any more because it would have just made me more nauseous and just signed all the papers. Then we had to sit there and watch some video of a guy with a beard that went down to his belly button talking about the stuff we just signed. At least he made me laugh. When we went outside, the guy told me to get geared up because I was next. Paul and I didn't get to go on the same plane.    The plane was really really small. No chairs and 5 people cramed into it. I was sitting on the guys foot that was behind me and some other guy was sitting on my foot in front of me. I got to sit right next to the door of the plane that slid up and all made of see through plastic. That made me feel so safe... The ride up (11,000 feet) was 20 minutes long. By that time, my feet were numb and my ears were popping and my hands were clammy. I think the height does something to your body. For some reason I kept wanting to burp and fart. I know that sounds kind of gross but it's true.        urlLink    That's me in the white shirt. I'm smiling but I'm freaking out at the same time...  urlLink      When we were over the landing strip, the guy strapped onto my back opened the door. I think that's when I started panicing. I mean, I was sitting pressed up against the door and he opened it!! Then he leans out to see if we're directly over it and since I was connected to his chest, I had to follow. I have to say, it's pretty windy up there and cold. It was the middle of summer and I was freezing. Looking out the plane made my head feel like I took a whole bunch of allergy medicine. But from up there, it doesn't look like your are high. The land looked like a map with all the boxy grids and everything.   Then he says "Ok, put your left leg out and stand outside of the plane". And in my head I'm freaking out, but I pretended all was good. Then it happened so fast, he lunged us foward and we were falling. You know how when you go down on a roller coster? It was nothing like it. The feeling you get in your throat wasn't there. It just felt like a lot of wind and didn't feel like falling. I looked around and I don't remember what I was thinking but I would imagine I'd think "wow". The only thing I really remember was that it was windy, so windy that I couldn't really breath too well. So I was concentrating on breathing.. It felt like a long time of falling. After you jump off the plane, theres nothing left to do but to enjoy it (since you can't really do anything about it).   Then he gave me the signal to pull the paracheute and I couldn't find the string so he ended up pulling it. The ride down was so relaxing. He let me steer and we did spins and turns. The landing was ok, I just kinda fell.        urlLink    If you look closely, on the cloud, the pink dot, to the right of the blue dot... that's me.  urlLink      When we landed, it didn't feel like a big deal, like nothing just happened. I think I was in shock or something. Then Paul went up. I got him the video taping of his fall. He had a great time too. The look on his face when he had to step out of the plane was priceless. He made the "Oh Shit" face. I have the picture of it, I'll keep it forever and ever.     urlLink    Paul is on the bottom. He got all the nice pictures. I love how the ground looks.  urlLink      urlLink    Doesn't he look so happy? I decided not to put the "Oh Shit" face on here...  urlLink       We were in a daze after that for the whole day. It's weird how you can get so drained by just falling through the sky. Anyway, that was my experience. I'm glad I did it and I would probably do it again but I'm not sure about any time soon.

       I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I wonder what all these buttons do... I think I figured out how to put pictures in.     urlLink    Orion and Sabrina  urlLink      These are my cats, Orion (sleepy) and Sabrina (not sleepy). Isn't it so cute how they're holding paws? Anyway, I wanna see if this works.
