      Listing to Chance of a lifetime by: Mest  Ok so its almost 2 am. Sat June 26. Annie is downstairs asleep on my couch. I couldnt sleep. Im a bit freaked  by the whole camp thing. I mean I have never been to camp in my life and so the first time I go I am really going. Like for 3 weeks in a forgin country!! I know I will have fun it hopefully will be just like my band trip to Orlando, Fl. it was a blast!!! Still I have the whole trust issue thing, I dont know what im going to do about that. Well I was just a little paranoied i will b back soon to freak out again! O and I just read Kimmy's thing on about how her roommate always gets to the bathroom 1st. That is something to contemplate.

      Ok so kaitlynn and I went to the mall. O what fun! haha then we had dinner then i went to her house. We decided to go for a walk and we walked around Hampton Cove. When we get back Kaitlynn realizes that she drops her phone so we retrace our steps. caling it every 5 seconds. Finally someone anwseres an they say theh have it and tell us where they are so we could get it. When we get there its dark and a girl gives us her phone. Then this random guy says "Hi Im popie" or something like that. And Kaitlynn is like "Oh hi Im Kaitlynn" and me not knowing the person was like "As far as u know I dont have a name" He did this VERY odd little cackle thig and then the girl yells at him to come back and he says something along the lines of that hes just haveing fun. I realize that he is like 1 inch behind me and then he grabs my ass. Just as I was about to punch im we hear. "You know i think we should get a reward for finding ur phone." It came from 2 guys who were leaning on a car. I figured I could take on one guy but not 3. The 1st thing that ran through our minds was not that they wanted money, which they did but we said we had none and left. It was fun for the whole family...haha. Arent guys just peachy? P.S. I HATE SCHOOL!!!
