      i think the fact that this site is hidden gives me reason to feel like i can openly express whats going on in my life and not worry that i'm hurting someone...  summer just started, i'm excited...but at the same time kind of dissapointed because i can already see myself wasting it away.  i wish i had the motivation every second of every day to accomplish the things that i have on my 'list'. who knows maybe i will...  life right now...can be described as complicated, but when is life not? to start off i guess i should explain my relationships with people since friends and family are the main excuses for why my life is the way that it is.  family: i just had a long talk with my parents last night about responsibilities and maturity and fun stuff like that, i'm not really sure if i got anywhere but atleast i tried.  danielle and derek arn't very big problems at the moment, were all just trying to survive our own lives...  friends:  justin-  this relationship is complicated enough in itself, justin, my ex...is one of my best friends...and we still act like friends...and sometimes more.  i'm not really sure what we are, but if i find a name for it i'll let you know.  i still care about him...actually i care about him a lot, and this recent break up is still a shock to me even though i know it needed to happen.  i guess what makes this friendship complicated is the fact that i'm not really sure what justin expects or looks for in me.  i ask sometimes, but he seems to avoid the question, either intentional or not.  not that i'm assuming that he feels this way or has intended for me to suspect this but i'm worried that this [insert name of relationship here] is going to turn into some kind of dependency. not for me, but for him....i guess i'm worried that he'll get the impression that because i still love him i'll be willing to be 'there' for him whenever he wants. sounds horrible huh...and inside i really know that justin wouldn't intentionally want this to be a result of what were going through.  so thats my motivation to keep hope in the friendship but i guess i can kind of sense a forshadowing of something going wrong in the future.  its like one day we can be happy, hang out...kiss...and just be there for eachother and then the next he can push me away and make fun of me.  then the next time he wants to be a little more intimate he apologizes....its only happened a couple of times, so you would think that i have nothing to worry about.  but imagine the state i'm in right now...i was in a relationship for a year and two months and we both fell in love.  justin leaves for basic in the summer so we decide that when he leaves we would take a break....something happenes (i'm still clueless as to what) and he decides to break it off 2 months earlier...so one day we're holding hands and kissing and then the next, nothing, we, or i guess i, had to pretend like nothing ever happened and we were just friends.  i wanted to make him happy so...i went a long with it.  now after a week or so i'm kinda getting used to the idea that, justin isn't mine anymore and we start hanging out and having fun as friends, everything seemed to be going well.  so one day...justin invites me over to his house to hang out. were sitting on the couch and he invites me to lay down a snuggle him [this kind of caught me off gaurd because before this there were no intimate or flirting relations] and then the next thing i know justin is kissing me.  i'm not going to lie, i liked it, actually no i loved it, because here i am sad that i feel like i'm losing the one person i want and then here he comes wisking me off my feet.  the one thing i learned from what has happened so far was to always be realistic, and i knew deep down that justin didn't want another relationship...i mean if i was leaving in 2 months i wouldn't want to be tied down too...soo what was going on? i guess it can be summed up that we're just two really good friends who still care about eachother a lot and share some intimate moments with eachother.  the question that i'm facing myself with now is whether this kind of realtionship is what the both of us needs.  i mean for me it did kind of help with me getting over what justin and i had on a deeper level...which sounds weird but stopping our relationship earlier cold turkey for a week was hard to get through, and now that i feel like i still have a part of him with me it helps me stay with reality but also have this 'romantic dream' with the person i wish i could be with. *sigh* i just wish i knew what was going on in justins head, its nearly impossible to know, he usually resists talking about that kind of stuff...but it is kind of important. no matter how much love i have for him, i'm not going to stand by and watch myself be used...i just hope that it doesn't turn into that.  guess thats all i have time for today....i'll post more later
