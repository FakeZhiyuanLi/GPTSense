      I was playing with how to host SoapService in IIS and used wsewsdl2.exe to create a stub(proxy) for the soapservice ..... for a long time i could not figure out what is wrong out as kept on getting errors that action is not supported ... after comparing the values in Service and that of proxy i found that wsewsdl2.exe made the case of all characters in action value to be lowercase.  Lucien acknowledges this at  urlLink MSDN WSE newsgroup  .

      I am in love with the messaging framework of WSE 2.0 ......just wrote the custom transport (soap.apdu) for communicating with the services on .NET SmartCard. Its awesome ... hides all the card protocol specific stuff. Just replace soap.tcp with soap.apdu in SoapClient and ready to rock and roll.  ##  Note : .NET SmartCard is not out of factory yet. For more information see  urlLink Axalto FAQ  for .NET SmartCard technology.

      I was looking for WS-Federation implementation on web when  urlLink John Bristowe  pointed me to good work they are doing at gotdotnet  urlLink workspace  ..... I liked the name Plumwork.Orange also as it is really a plumbing to existing WSE (2.0) package .... Orange is opposite to Indigo.. check out what John has to  urlLink say  about this.  I have started putting implementation for WS-Federation in the workspace ... let's see how it turns out.

      Atlast found some thing to have [more] clean registry .... though never really programmed in COM [.NET being my bread and butter from start] but have to use COM  time and again .. for eg Shim controls which help putting user controls in VS.NET, MMC etc etc.  Tools mainly used while playing with COM :  regasm : tool in .NET Framework to register/unregister dotnet assemblies in windows registry. regsvr32 : tool in Win32 to install/uintsall dll as in-proc server  if you go through a process of using these tools for register & install it seems that whatever you added in registry would go away using unregister & uninstall but its not the case, you could see type library entries in registry even after unregister/uninstall from these tools.  here comes for rescue a good tool/utility from Jose at  urlLink developerfusion.com  .... this would get rid of stale entries from your registry.  Thanks to Jose for this good tool.

      WSE guys have done a great job this time for refining the APIs for custom transport and channels ........ planning to do some custom transport & channel myself but having a doubt how useful other transports will be ...http & tcp being the sufficient and most required ones.... may be smtp !!  these custom transports may be interested for peripheral devices which do not speak n/w protocols ....

      I was trying to dump the messages exchanged between STS, Psedonym Service and Client (aspx page) and wanted to display them in lower frame of my pages. My first attempt was to read the message dump generated by WSE Diagonstic filter but could not do it that way as WSE acquires a lock on the files in which messages are dumped. So I was left with no option other than dumping them in the file which will be used by message-frame for its contents. Since I have to put my dump inside the parent tag of Xml document I was bit stingy writing a parser and while looking for a neat way to do it I came across nice tips from Dare Obasanjo  urlLink article &nbsp;on MSDN. &nbsp; I used the Xml inclusion technique that he mentions and it works great. Basically you view your log (xml file) encapsulated by another which uses DTD to include fragements in log xml file. This was neat and best way to update logs. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I was searching for EAD for my wife and found a very informative site  urlLink ImmigrationPortal .   This is an excellent site having forums for all visa categories. I even saw a discussion asking the same question i had just asked my lawyer.

      Check out the comparison between  urlLink Liberty alliance and WS-Federation .  Dave Kearns mentions  urlLink here  about the 3rd identity federation specfication called  urlLink Shibboleth from the Internet2 community .  But this is a mess....one more thing I found disturbing is the existence of  urlLink WS-I . If WS-* standards are made by such a vast tech-community there should not be another standard to address interoperability...as far as I am concerned this defies the whole purpose of having standards.   urlLink
