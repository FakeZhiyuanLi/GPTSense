      I really need to get back on track on cooking/creating better meals for my family while sticking to a budget.  I used to be so good about buying just what we needed for a whole week, having enough for all meals, while being creative in my cooking.  We also need to start cooking enough again so that we have enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  Eating lunch out is  not always so healthy and not great on my budget.  I figured that making a journal out of this will give me some accountability.  I hope to include recipes, shopping lists,menus, and will also share some of my bargain finds.  At present moment, my fridge is practically empty.  I sit at work with ice coffee on hand, browsing  urlLink All Recipes  and having none of the ingredients to make the meals I want.

      Its Monday again.  Sitting at work....had my coffee.  No chance to read the paper yet.  I think I need another cup of coffee though.  Still too distracted to function as well as I should.  It was a nice weekend.  We took G to the zoo in Burlington.  A tiny zoo that charges a lot of money.  But G enjoyed it, so that is what matters.  It was the perfect day to be outside anyways.  A perfect day to feed the monkeys.  I need to plan ahead better to get more out of my weekend.  I would like to get away for a weekend.  We really haven't had a real family "vacation" where we are not going to visit people.  I want to be a tourist.  I want to visit a city for the sake of visiting the city.  If we are social when there, its an added bonus.  I also need to start ebaying again.  I miss it and we have plenty of stuff to ebay...just have been too lazy to take pictures and list.  I should do some bargain hunting for ebay as well.

      A couple people have asked me what my title means. Prior to a couple months ago we didn't have a tv.  We recently purchased a tv that came with a dvd player, and subscribed to a cable package and netflix as well.  Since then, I have had the joy on catching up on my favorite show....past seasons included thanks to netflix.  CSI and Law & Order keep my nights (after 9pm) full.  I full appreciate netfflix, TNT, and the USA Networks for keeping me occupied during the late night hours when I can't fall asleep.  I have 105 titles on my netflix queue and constantly seeking more...any recommendations?

      I have admired people who have blogs.  I have always had a lot to say. Finally decided to come to this venue for posting my musings.    I hope that this site can be a place where I can share anything and everything.    Just warning you that my thoughts might be a bit random and varied for my interests run the gamut from Cooking to CSI to politics and everywhere in between.

      Well...there was no red,white,and blue on this Canadian.  But I did see the fireworks from the front stoop.  Oh Joy!   So it's John Edwards....If you run to your nearest newstand in NYC, you will see the goof-up that the  urlLink New York Post  did. On their front cover this morning, it says that Kerry picked Gephardt....oops!  Everyone knows the post is for satire anyways and not real news. I am glad that Kerry chose Edwards for a running mate.    In other news I saw  urlLink Farenheit 911 .  I highly recommend it!  Excellent work.  It made me sad, angry, and I also laughed a few times.  I love Michael Moore.  I hope that this movie gives some Bush People something to think about.
