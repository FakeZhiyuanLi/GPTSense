      Back in the dayz when I was young um not a kid anymore but some dayz I sit n wish I was a kid again, I miss the old dayz. Smoked so much back then my memory still in a haze.&nbsp;I remember shit in flash backs, its like one memory leads to another. They usually are hilarious&nbsp;&nbsp;when I think about them now, though may have been uncomfortable&nbsp; at the time or just plain out been some&nbsp;funny ass shit. I had a blast and if asked to go back I would do it all over again cause its got me where I'm at now witch is fuck'n fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out Like That, Drewdizzle

      Hey man it's cool how we set this blog up so we can rap about back in the day so other foolz can enjoy it.  I was thinking of all the crazy shit we pulled of back in the day.  Remember freak fest '99? we where in the Hip Hop room and was busted for smoking bomb and got are ass thrown out that bitch.  We had to walk home from south side all the way back to the west.  Remember we where walking Downtown when New Years stuck THAT WAS HELLA WEAK SAUCE.  Then we meet up with that one tweaker guy we new from high school at jackin the box on 4th street and we kicked it out his house playing Metal gear solid.
