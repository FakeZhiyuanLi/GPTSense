       went for the AJC competition today but ny didn't get into the finals. rjc got first followed by vjc and MI. well i think we were not v well prepared, that's why. but it was a gd experience.  haha i had lots of fun today making fun of kim. houchun, kenneth, connie and wanying joined in the fun as well. in the beginning this kim said she wanted to bring us somewhere for vegetarian food but after walking for like 20 mins she said she can'r rmb the place. hai~ so we ended up in mos burger. had fish burger for lunch then. kim, kenneth, houshun and xueying discussing abt some ccs stuff while connie, wanying and i were gossiping. i think kim is a victim or rather already someone who's on the verge of killing us. haha but we enjoyed making fun of her and i think she's enjoying it as well. =P frankly speaking, i think she and boya will make a gd pair but she keeps insisting tt it's impossible. i think she has really high expectations. girl, lower ur expectation lah~ i think ccs is having a bbq next weekend. hai~ i hate bbqs. firstly it's not healthy, secondly, it's v inconvenient and well when we have such gatherings, it'll only be fun n enjoyable when close friends are around. but i am not v close with the pple in ccs except for some.  i saw this v sweet musical cum jewellery box @ jubilee centre today. it's pink in colour and the tune is "colours in the wind" the pocahontas theme song. it's damn nice and i love it at first sight. but i think it's rather ex($25.90) so i will consider before buying it. but i always wanted a musical box cos it seemed so fairytale...haha and i finally found one..hai~ think abt it first.  have tuition tml morning and i have not completed my assignments. have to do it later or else i'll feel guilty. haha i feel guilty easily but i am just too cheeky n playful. although i am cheeky n playful but i am not childish.=)    Virgo Girl The Virgo girl is a shy and reserved young lady, disposed to spending much of her time fretting over things. She is a perfectionist who is never satisfied. The ever-organised Virgo is forever planning and making lists. She chooses her friends, both boys and girls with care. She prefers the company of like-minded individuals, perhaps those who are as health conscious as her. As Virgo rules the nervous system, this young girl is prone to nervousness and anxiety. She is consumed by her obsession for detail. Studious and hardworking, she always gets good grades, which gives her immense satisfaction. She is not out there to seek glory and fame, but merely the satisfaction that comes from a job well done. Relationship with her siblings may not be good as she is prone to criticise them constantly. Academically, she is inclined towards research activities. She is ideally suited to be a doctor, nurse, programmer or editor.    kim sent this to me. do u think it describes me well? haha i think to a certain extent it is true.  i put kim's n houshun's photo as my display pic just now and guessed wad? yat chun said kim looked nice. haha. finally...i finally found someone for tt fussy guy. i am so proud of myself leh..haha now kim has one more choice liao. okie i'll end here..gd night n sweet dreams =)

       i had a great time during LEP P1 today..haha..i kept laughing cos i think it's really funny..when lin lao shi talked abt kong zi's descendants , somehow or rather hwee hoon mentioned kong qing xiang (william hung) and all of us laughed. when she asked abt "luo yang" i said loyang.=P actually i was just being cheeky. i like lin lao shi's lessons. i think her lessons are the best and least boring among all other lep lessons. well, fridays are chinese days and i had a pretty great time.  i can't help but make fun of kimberly and boya. actually it was really for the sake of teasing them but somehow everyone in class made fun of her.it's funny when u see the expression on her face whenever boya's name is being mentioned. kim's a nice friend who has helped me alot..copying the first 3 mths math tutorials, helping me with chinese etc. haha...she always say i am ungrateful and she regret helping me. but it's really pleasant to have her around cos she'll chatter away. and seriously, i think her life revolves around 3 leading characters ( boya,houshun and kenneth).haha..it's true.   i'm going for the AJC competiton tml but i am rather unprepared. left sch before the meeting with lin zhong yan lao shi cos i haf something on. connie handled the blazor and shoes thingy for me. quite surprised she actually remembers my shoe size and blazor size. it's rather wen xin to know that people around me actually remembers some small tiny details abt myself withour me knowing it=).  i have a great pw group this time round. fangyu, wanying and amanda are great members. it's my first time working with such a nice considerate group of pple. in the past, my pw groups always have internal conflicts and everyone was unwilling to compromise. i hope we'll get a band 1.=) jia you!  pam seemed to be v happy. somehow or rather i sensed her joy(after reading her blog).haha but i am glad tt she's found someone to cheer her up on rainy days and she got her own i book n i pod. i think these are the reasons tt made her smile=). another reason could be the appreciation she got from judy when she gave judy her birthday gifts. it's a really pleasant feeling to know tt someone appreciates all that u haf done. it makes the effort seemed worthwhile.  Becca smsed me today to inform me abt the swim suits sale at royale sporting house. haha..i told her to get a pink bikini=P. i think becca needs security and she's someone you'll want to protect cos she gets hurt pretty easily. seriously i think she has not gotten over him. in reality, time dun heal the emotional pain but people who r escaping from reality keep telling themselves time will heal the pain. it's useless..really.  lastly, i hope everyone around me will be happy and tml's competition will go smooothly for nyjc.  Good nite=)

       it's a tiring day today..kind of pissed also..going for the AJC competition this sat and i was only informed today.Awe..it's terrible...i've not been reading newspapers lately except the part on showbiz news =P. isn't it sad? on the overall sch's alright today. Ms Poh's lesson was so much better than the previous one..haha i think she was rather pissed tt day. She kept picking on houshun. i think we're somehow in thw wrong as well cos..frankly speaking i dun think many of us read the econs lecture notes before attending her class. haha..but we did learn quite alot tt day and i finally know how to draw the supernormal,normal and subnormal curves for monopoly. haha...i think those graphs will stay with me for some time.=) btw, am i realy like a kid? i seriously dun think so. but pple in my class dun seem to know me well enough. forgivable la cos we've only known each other for less than half a year. i admit i can be childish at times but i do have my mature sides as well. =) gota complete my yu wen lian xi tonight or else i wun be able to hand it in tml. and i dun want to hand in late work cos it'll leave a bad impression. oh ya i've got 19hrs for CIP this term...=)=)  i am beginning to get sick of CCS but i dun think i can quit as i only have&nbsp;my LEP club and CCS to rely on liao or i wun have PEARLS points. sigh~ it's miserable..thinking of joing another cca which doesn't require tt much time but dunnoe wad to join leh.i'll end here...bye =)

       sch ended early today. fridays are early days but nonetheless,i am feeling v lethargic. 金宝丽说我有黑眼圈..that's the consequences of not having enough slp. hai~ slept around one yesterday cos i wanted to hand in all my 红楼梦assignments today. it's not good to owe assignments cos they'll just accumulate. haha so glad that i cleared my 红楼梦today. but didn't manage to hand up my 创作3 today cos really can't squeeze time to do liao. 彭老师started teaching第八回today and it's not as bad as i imagined. haha. hopefully,it'll maintian this way. but i really don't like 陈老师's way of teaching leh. gota go to sch for my GP block test tml. whoa! it's going to be a full paper. after the block test go home bathe and i have to go out again for the ccs thingy. seriously, i really dun like such stuff cos i think it's just a waste of time.联络感情is just a excuse. and i am really getting more n more sick of ccs. it's not as fun as i though it would be. math common test next tues and i haven't really prepared for it. i guessed i'll have to burn midnight oil tonight n tml night. i'll leave @ 7 for the ccs thingy tml cos i really dun want to stay for so long for a meaningless event.       frankly speaking, i have a greater sense of attachment to lep than ccs. lep is more democratic and we can voice our opinions n thoughts freely. the committee members & teachers will take our suggestions into considerations but in ccs everyone seemed to be so afraid of the teacher and dare not say anything no matter how fed up or pissed they are. i think it's really meaningless to have a club like that. moreover teachers in ccs are much more understanding &amp; accomodating as compared to those in ccs. one last thing why lep is much better than ccs is that committe members in lep fight for students' benefits n they care for our welfare but in ccs, committee members are just too afraid of the teacher. u see the point?      after hearing about a friend's family yesterday, i felt v blessed and fortunate. people tend to envy others having things they do not have but do these people really sit down and think how fortunate they are compare to others? we shld really count our blessings and be contented with wad we have instead of complaining over the lack of material luxury. like i mentioned before, 物质享受不可能是永恒的，只有得到心灵与精神的满足才是幸福！      becca smsed me this morning. haha i am really happy for her cos she waited so long for this day lor. hey loi, this proves that 你们还是有缘份的，不要气馁，努力争取吧！all the best! hope the ending will be wad u wished for...a fairytale ending..=)      yun got her "O"lvl chinese results liao. i think she did pretty well but she's not v satisfied. i really understand how she feels cos i am a 过来人. anyway,yun need not fear that she wun do well cos i am v confident that things will be different this time round. 继续加油吧！just a few more months and all ur efforts will be paid off!    ah mah wasn't feeling v well yesterday and all of us were kind of worried. she was pretty stubborn and didn't want to go to the doc's. somehow i managed to persuade her. guessed wad's wrong with her? her BP(blood pressure)shot all the way up to 200! it's v v v high! i am kind of worried cos she's old le and i hope she'll be healthy so she can stay by my side forever...although i know it's impossible but i really want her to see me go to U,graduate from U,start working and maybe even see me get married(if i intend to lah,haha). 希望自己能快点长大。时间一天天过，我一天天长大，她一天天变老，多么希望我世界里的时间过得快一些，她世界里的时间会停止。。。 i'll end here..tke care..and as usual,祝大家幸福！ 祝阿嬷健康！

       yoz!!! just reached home. went for the NDP with loi and the whole place is so damn packed. haha but we had lots of fun. hope to go again next year. after the parade loi n i stayed for a while for the post parade party and guessed wad? i managed to take 3 pictures of JJ(lin jun jie). haha..he quite cute n talented leh. then we squeeze our way through onto bus 21 and meet pam & denice at TM's mac. we did alot of catching up n stuff. haha..actually i was kind of glad that we did not drift away much despite our busy schedules.=) i was so touched when the whole stadium paid tribute to Mr Goh Chok Tong. i think he's a really nice man. humble n sociable. kind of sad that he's stepping down in 3 days time. but looking on the bright side..he'll have more time with his family. Singapore will miss him badly..sob sob.. btw loi claimed that she saw "him" although we were so far apart..i think it's the feeling ba..nt sure. coincidentally, he's the motivator of yellow   sector and loi &amp; i are also sitting at the yellow sector. is this fate?i suppose so . 如果爱一个人就应该尽力去争取，不是吗？ i think loi shld fight for her own happiness.       i am the most lucky one..=)so fortunate right? cos i am not troubled by relationship probs..and i hope i wun be in future as well. tml's going to be a busy day for me cos i have lots of stuff to do. one 创作，一篇叙别会感想和红楼梦！   i'll end here..good night n sweet dreams! all the best to singapore!   P.S:loi and i also feel that 阿兵哥are so damn cool! loi love those from SAF..=P

       firstly one piece of gd news>>i managed to complete my tutorial 15 yesterday night!=)=)   as usual, i went for tuition this morning till 12 then hang around  eastpoint while waiting for ramya. she passed me a donation booklet and asked me to help her sell mah. i managed to sell 5 tickets. saw jing rou and ee chieh kor @ the void deck when i reach home. jing rou is getting cuter n cuter but as the same time rounder n rounder. haha..she's my 接班人=P i think she's been eating quite alot ba...i really like her and know wad i like best abt her? her smile. it's so sweet,pure & innocent. we seldom get to see such smiles..cos pple are getting more scheming and hypocritical these days. the world's changing and pple change with time? hm..have i changed? seriously, i did. i am no longer that happy liao. dunnoe why maybe it's due to the environment. i hope to go back to the past..cos i'm always surrounded &amp; filled with laughter. but presently i am always vexed and stressed up=( played with jing rou for a while then went to take a nap(i was so tired!). woke up at 4 then went to the supermarket with my aunt for groceries. then watched "a kindred spirit". i really like that show cos 善姨's family is so caring and i am touched by her kind gestures and attitude towards pple. hope to have more of such people around me. after "a kindred spirit" i went to take a shower then went out for dinner. just reached home only. so tired. and i'm feeling sleepy again! yes again! haha...我是猪的投胎转世!   no 灵感 to write my 创作三和叙别会感想. hai~ but no matter what, i hopt to email lin lao shi soon. otherwise i'm so inefficient. thought of getting Z Chen's album but broke leh..hai~ nvm lah cos it's not a necessity. can do without it de.    “精神和身心都感到疲惫。好希望可以找到让自己开怀大笑的原因。虽然不是很悲哀但也不是很快   乐。我到底幸福吗？如果不幸福那是为什么呢？有什么事物或人物会使我感受道一丝幸福的感觉吗？自从上了初院，日子过得好快，功课压力也增加了。很快的，一年就要过去了。去年的今天我还在为会考担心呢！明年的今天又会是怎样的？人会随着时间渐渐地成长，思想上也会因此而成熟。我有变得更成熟吗？我的人生价值观有改变吗？一时之间我感到好彷徨无助。上苍赐给我的守护天使在哪？”    人经常会埋怨现状但时间一旦过了又怀念过去。人是反复无常的动物。。。   没有昨天就不会有今天，没有今天就没有明天。好好珍惜眼前的一切美好事物与所爱的人吧！祝福大家！

       went to sch today for national day celebration. it's not v fun n the atmosphere is not high enuff. =S i was so tired..we walked all the way from nyjc to serangoon mrt then back to sch for treasure hunt.kim,connie and i were @ the back of the class cos our legs can't take it liao. it's such a long distance. moreover kim n connie are exempted from pe. half way thru, kim wasn't feeling v well so we took a cab bcak to sch with ms tan. after that it was the LEP farewell party for year 2. the food wasn't that bad compared to those normal stuff schs usually get for students. there were jelly, beehoon,fried chicken wings, samosa and vegetables. time really flies..the year 2 are leaving le. and i'll also be leaving next year. it's a really short time in jc and i think it's time for me to wake up from my slumber n study hard. promo is coming and i do not want to be retain..not only is it malu,it's also a waste of time. but i just lack the determination..so i think i'll need to force myself to study. thinking back, i was studying really hard during this time last year. cos we wre all preparing for the "Os". i'll be sitting for the higher chinese paper this year and i haven't even touch the bks. it's really time i wake up n reflect before it's too late.      the next celebration will be teachers' day..dunnoe wad programmes they are planning..hope it'll be something fun..not sure if we're going back to coral on teachers' day,it all depends on our time table. hopefully we can back it back. kind of miss coral..haha i'm always like tt...when i'm in that sch i can't wait to step out but when i'm out i start to miss the times i spent in that sch. today chun qiong thanked the LEP teachers and i think they really put in alot of effort..LEP teachers in nyjc are totally different from my previous chinese teachers. in the past, i used to think that chinese lessons are nothing but boredom but after i got into LEP chinese lessons are totally different. they're fun and interesting. esp during gu wen. i really admire lin lao shi cos she makes gu wen so lively and fun. haha...this changed my impression of chinese.=)      just ate chee chong fun..not very nice leh. haha feel like eating something else..i'll end here.bye

       it's a boring day. had maths lecture n econs tutorial this morning and GP &amp; LEP in the afternoon. school ends @ 5:10pm but one piece of good news...i'm not going to sch tml. intend to accompany ah mah to the polyclinic instead of watsing time playing silly games around serangoon. life can really be boring when there isn't any exitement. i'm doing the same thing everyday. wake up @ 6. reach sch around 7:10 then reach home around 7. watch xi ling men till 8 then do some work. slp and it's the next day. isn't it boring?haha think it's time for me to look for some excitement liao.      connie has some prob with that girl again. haha as usual she's pissed off. actually i really dun understand their gp, discussing almost daily and not arriving at any conclusion. sometimes i kind of pei fu. haha=P (i am v sarcastic hor?) however i'm not going to poke my nose in the gp's prob cos it's not my prob. and i'm having a pleasant time with my gp.       going to have a long weekend. 5 days in total cos i'm having my own holiday tml. =)intend to have a gd slp tml cos i am really lack of slp..i'll also start my vector tutorial tml, hope to complete it tml. having my GP block test next sat. hope i'll pass. yah i'm just expecting a better pass cos i'm been doing badly for english though i didn't fail but my standard's just not there. kinds worried cos GP is a v impt subject. need to plan for my chuang zuo 3 as well. Due next friday and take some time off to seriously go thru hong lou meng n do the assignments.       intend to write abt my relationship with ah mah in my third chuang zuo. sometimes i feel really lucky to have her around me cos she's always tt concerned abt me. =) the first thing she'll ask when i stepped home is " taken ur lunch/dinner?" besides tt she'll always be the one who's worried abt me. it's really heart warming to know that someone in this world actually worries if u've eaten and if u're hungry. i've been with her since the day i was born and we've always been v close. we talk abt many things..from gossips to guys..haha..actually i intend to get her a v special birthday gift this year(her birthday's in oct) but still clueless abt wad to get for her. i'm really lucky n fortunate to have her around=) thanks ah mah..i hope to share all my memories with her.   i am really thankful to have her around. basically i'm leading a pretty happy life now and i think one will only be truly happy is he/she is contented mentally and material luxuries will not give someone contentment in the long run. so be thankful for wad u have n count ur blessings      just received a call from kim. she's also ponning sch tml to go to IKEA with her mum. haha..we're 2 of a kind. but connie's coming cos her mum dun allow her to pon sch. poor connie. so kim n i will have a long,pleasant n sweet weekend.        humph!  loi is a betrayer   =P

       had this rather long ccs meeting this afternoon and it ended at round 6:10pm. just kind of pissed. first of all i dun see a need in the so called gathering. i think they shld organise a gathering when they have the second intake and not now. pple are busy preparing for tests n exams,promos. do u think anyone will be in the mood for partys n gatherings? worst of all, it took them such a long time to arrive at a conclusion. the conclusion makes me even more pissed!going to marina bay for seafood thingy? hai~ why they can't simplify things like go out on a cca day for lunch together at junction 8 or wad? even having pizzas and kfc in sch is okie too. ever since i stepped into jc, i realise that i've not been doing anything but PAY PAY and just PAY. i wun mind if it is for necessities like acadamic stuff but worst of all i'm always paying for stuff that doesn't concerns me. hey, we're talking abt money k. and who in this world dun love money?   when u spend money it has to be money well spent!   this month UNnecessities:   1. "shithole"performance>>$12   2. LEP farewell for year 2>>$6   3.CCS farewell for year 2>>$2   4.CCS gathering at marina bay>>$12   Total>>$32    the reason why pple go in cliques is bcos they feel comfortable with those pple they hang out with. and if pple are not interested in joining others, no matter wad others do, pple wun change. pple are who they are and when u're friends with them, u learn to accept them for who they are and not change them. if changes are required that it shows tt the person is not suitable to be wif u. it is v simple. i'll give a analogy>>>if a guy likes a girl and he expects her to change this n that for him then he's actually loving another person of tt character. in that case u might as well look for someone with the character traits he desire. no point trying or forcing someone to change becos of u. and a person in the correct state of mind will not do that.   i'm getting of damn bloody freaking sick of CCS. it is totally different from wad i expected it to   be. a   BIG    disappointment!and pple in there esp teachers are v difficuilt to get along with. it's just the practical world. one word to describe my feelings now>>  SICK   !      went to hand in the house com thingy today, hope i can get in then i'll leave CCS for good. pls pray for me n wish me luck cos i need them badly. i miss the times i talk n complain to loi,pam n lynette over the phone. cos i'm just too busy for the phone nowadays. and besides them i dun think anyone else understand how i am feeling right now. i am in the state of going berserk!   can't think of anything tt can help me relieve stress except venting out my frustrations on this keyborad...tt's why i am typing so roughly!!!

       went to bed at 10:30pm yesterday night. i was so damn tired and i couldn't keep my eyes open. so after watching "tian mi feng bao" i dropped dead on my bed. haha..but my pompom was with me. somehow or rather i am always v happy when pom's around. =) pom will stay with me for as long as i live de.. v impt to me..haha..  had miss tan's lesson yesterday afternoon in a non air conditioned room. due to the humid weather and the boredom, i almost dozed off. i think it was kind of stress attending miss tan's class she'll ask me to answer questions during lessons to keep my eyes open. i prefer wu lao shi's way of teaching..maybe is due to the experience ba but i undretsnad better. if not for the vcd i watched the night before i wun even know wad miss tan's toking abt. it made me feel that not everyone is cut out to be a teacher. doing well acadamically doesn't mean tt the person will be a gd teacher. teaching is a skill that will improve with time. jia you miss tan!  almost everyone who knows me know tt i dun read chinese books. so it's a kind of torture for me to read the first 40 chapters of hong lou meng. can anyone imagine how i feel when i open the book? i can hardly keep my eyes open. reading a book for examinations and reading a book for leisure is totally different. it just stresses me out!  btw i think my english standard is going down the drain. is it becos i've been speaking chinese to pple around me or wad? but i think 80% of the pple in nyjc speaks chinese. haha..yah it's a more chinese environment. so i decided to switch to english liao.haha..more ang mo..  miss lynette poh's lessons are also stressful lessons. haha..when u give her tt blur look she'll 100% ask u a question. haha but i'm blur most of the time. i dun really know wad's going on in her lessons. esp on tues when the lesson is after lep hong lou meng...a normal person will NOT stay awake de. then we'll have econs from 4:10 to 5:10. from 7:40 to 4:10 lessons n lessons so at 4:10 who'll be awake? i seriously think tt she shld change the lesson to fridays. but some pple in my class are just so uncooperative. sigh~such long days reminds me of the days i spent in coral. haha but we'll all encourage one another to go on...miss tracy tan, mr cheang, mrs ho n mr lim will also encourage us and put thmselves in our shoes n think for us. but in ny, pple are just not like them. i am beginning to miss coral. =(  But....i'm glad to have a nice PW group. in the past members in my PW groups nv got along really well and there r always internal conflicts and everybody ended up with " emotional injuries" but in my presnt group, we're all v open and we will say wad we feel. it's better this way as everyone will know how u're feeling n wad's on ur mind. but in some groups pple are just too sensitive. my group are all made up of girls. haha and the 3 of them are all from girls' sch so i think they know how to work well with girls. haha. toking abt pw...we had a big "cat fight" last year..haha...over the eco garden pond thingy...hai~ but i'm really v happy that i have such a wonderful group now. =) 3 cheers for curious minds! ( my gp name..nice?)

       it's NDP this coming mon! haha i'm going for the NDP with loi and we'll be sitting at the yellow sector. after that we can go "chiong" or go makan.=P this sunday, i'm also going for the singapore fireworks festival...haha...5566,cyndi wang, r&amp;b are coming..but i think it's going to be v v crowded. i am going to have a great national day this year..lots of fun awaits me!!  i'm going to die for my "hong lou meng" test yesterday. 3 essay questions and i only used a piece of paper. besides tt i only filled in 10% of all those blanks. smart right? =P actually i didn't study at all cos everytime i open the book i feel sleepy. and those damn wordings are so damn SMALL. so i tot of a great idea...watch the vcd first. but the theme song is so damn long n slow!!! and i watched it with half my eyes closed. so can someone think of a brillant solution? anyway, why must we learn "hong lou meng"? it's so confusing n difficult.  i think i'm going to have a tough time this year cos i'm lagging behind my class. i've not been keeping up with econs n math. although i've been going for tuition but i feel that i kind of dui bu qi my tutor cos i've not been doing enough work for her. i used to do so much more..hai~ i feel tat i haf v little time for myself nowadays and i'm always so lethargic. i must really do something abt this before things go really really wrong .
