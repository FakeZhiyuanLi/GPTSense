Todae me maybe going to tell you about my lifestyle?? Actually i don't reallie like school holidays.. i miss my school.. During sch holidays.. I can't go out and usually go out and play.. then come home tired. >.   Me and my "ex" together got 8 months liao.. then suddenly break up cause of the poor results of his.. so his father dun let us to be together (i think ba).. So sad know?? Actually, my heart is still so confused that if i still love him anot? i duno leh? Out of 100 % maybe can give 70% (i love him) 30 % ( i dun love him) Dun love not hate ar.. !!! i have stick glow in the dark on my ceilings... Which ish his name and my name.. One dae, one letter from his name drop off, and i search the whole dae for it.. When i ask my younger sister, she said: " i think my maid have swept it in the dustbin ! " WTH man !! haha .. sianz.. sometimes.. he reallie did something that makes me reallie reallie hate him !! Merely wanted to kill him ! *kaka* (so sillie)    i like this quote?? ----> One dae, the moon said to me " Since he makes you cry, why don't you leave him? " I replied : " Would you ever leave your sky? "
