      Um hey guyz, Im gona try and post a new thing each day and let ya in on what's happening with me! Now today I went to school:(  BORING !!! It was totally pathetic I was gona skip it but cudnt b stuffed!  and everytime I try to skip school I always head in the same direction and ALWAYS get cought by some friends on the way to school and they make me go! oh well! I alwayz think bout goin a different way to avoid them but were I want to go their is onli one way to it and if i go a different way ill get lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont wana get lost!!!!!!!!!!!! oh well theirz nutin I can do bout it! So how was all ur dayz 2day? I hope they ended up better then mine. I had so many things go wrong today! their waz some good stuff I guess... Like I helped 1 of my bestfriends sit nxt to da guy she likes in computing and I did alot of work on my personal project (on depression) but not much more exciting things happened! As you can tell me life is down right boring! But today waz real bad! I had all these voices and they weren't like usual. OH AND BY THE WAY IM   NOT   CRAZY!!! now back to what I was saying... Oh yer today The voices were like just different.  Usually  they say things like "you can't do this, your a problem child, no one wants you, your family hates you, i hate you" and shit like that. But these vocies sound so real! I here them all the time (im  NOT  crazy remember). But today it was just two people over and over again going "lol your such a joke madison", "your a fuckwit","You're a bitch and no-one will ever like you","I hate you we all do", "we just want to mess around with your head", "we never liked you and we never will again", "I just messed you around", "lol madison you crack me up" and heaps of other stuff. I actually have a problem but im  NOT  mental. It's because I suffer a deep case of   hulucinations  (that's where you hear or see things) I don't see things though. I just hear voices and I could swear that they are real... but they're not! All the voices I here are things that people have said to me in person or phone, about me, or on email! so their all things that have been said before. Like a flashback of voices! but it sucks I tell ya it really does! It's so annoying! and no-one knows I suffer from them! Well mls_gurl (jj) does but that's it! but she doesnt know that I always have them she thinks I've onli had dem once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so I hope she doesnt read this. I hope none of my friends that I see in school or friends or whatever read this! They will know to many of my thoughts and know to much about my life!!!!!!!!!! I cant let that happen and I wont!!!!!!!!! well i will try!!!!!!!!! See im having them now. They really interfere with my school life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They never shut up! I might just shout out "shut the fuck up" to no-one while im sitting in a group with my friends... they all give me this blank confused look. It's horrible. But they don't understand what's going on and what's going throught my head!!!! and I hope they never understand... if they do It will wreck them aswell and I   DONT    want that to happen!!!!!!!!! Now back to today... what else happened? Oh I had a fight with one of My bestfriends well shes not really a bestfriend but she's someone I can talk to and trust. I told her something and she said "now you really need help, tell your mum or dad, even a teacher at school, if you don't tell anyone or get any help I will do it for you"!!!!!!!! can you believe she said that!!!!??????  argh  shes such a bitch! AND after all that she tells me that she wants me to go and see a psychiatrist for SIX months EVERY week! can you believe she wud do that to me??!!  ARGH  it makes me so mad that people could be like that!! now in other news.... I had a fihgt with me dad about a movie... it's called Thirteen anyone seen it? Its really good. I watched it then my dad got all angry at me because it has stuff about sex, drugs, stealing, lying and selfinjury in it! and guess what? He thinks that it's going to influence me! He thinks it's because of the movies I watch that I self injure and do a drug and be suicidal! he thinks that all movies   influence    me! Influence me my ass! he shud just shut up somethimes. he is so annoying. He never fucking leaves me alone anymore! ARGH I HATE HIM!!!!!!!!! and he tells me to grow up  pfft  I think he has a bit of growing up to do! I shudnt be saying so much to complete strangers but... I guess u guyz are strangers. I dont hav a pic up so no1 can recognise me ^_^! But if ya do know me (not likely tho) dont tell my dad I say or anyone else! k??? Please dont show my dad this web page coz if he c's it I will be on the next plane to Queensland to live wit my mum! NOOOOOOO! I dont want to I wana stay in adelaide wit my bestfriends :) he he! Hey I guess I better go now! I've gota go  on msn and check my emails. I will try an post something tomorrow. Have fun guyz, luv ya, luv madz, p.s. If u hav msn add me!

I luv each and every one of my friends, i enjoy soccer!, I love hanging out with my friends, movies, boys, msn, email, music, and so much more. I am kinda down to earth. I can like practically anyone and everyone! I've got a great bunch of friends... and I have the coolest step sister in the world... now for the bad stuff My family hates me... I hate them. I have depression. I cut my wrists and have suicidal thoughts. I used to be seriously and completely a suicidal person... I tried it so may times but a few friends helped me out and friends are the only good thing in my life! oh and my dad has a new girlfriend... her name is Mary I HATE HER!!! but she has a cool daughter... Bianca... and two cool sons... David and Leon... they are all like years older then me but who gives. oh and my mum lives in Queensland and I live in South Australia and my real brother (Jason) lives with her. So I only see them 4 times a year. If you have any questions about me... um just ask... Luv Ya All, Madz
