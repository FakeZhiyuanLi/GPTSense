      It looks as though I will be working for Jeff very soon. He's been talking about it for years but quite frankly, I didn't take him too seriously. He's really stressed out and I feel for him but I know he'll be ok since he's hanging onto God. I was quite blown away when he mentioned in detail what he wanted me to do and how he's been looking ahead for the next 5 years. I always knew he'll be successful but didn't think it'll materialize this quickly. And he's young! Only 26!  Eh, I woke up around noon and I realized that I can no longer stay up all night. That, I must have some sleep. I went to the factory and saw that Gabe and Dan weren't there. And shortly after, Jay and Susan left too. I was hoping to surf the web but I guess Jay canceled his verizon account. Damn, Jay. So I put away my spaghetti in Jay's fridge and literally ran away from work. I mean there's laundry to do at home and I gotta make up my mind on where to get my car tuned, etc. Plus, I work hard on Sundays anyways so the damn invoices could be ready to be picked up on Monday. Besides, if it wasn't for me, they would have never seen the day when invoices would be produced consistently on a freaking monday!  Mmmm... Hot Chocolate! Why did I give you up, my darling? O, that's right. You make me itch. But there aren't too many hot beverages that don't contain caffeine or milk. Yoo Ja Cha is ok but they always put too much syrup in it. Cafes should start serving it either blander or have the hot water and candied oranges served separately so the customer can have it to her liking.   Eh, my laundry pile is beckoning me if that is possible.

      The dinner was so awkward. Hardly anybody talked. But once the alcohol started flowing, people started to chatter and so did I. The food wasn't all that great. First we had sushi and other side dishes and then there was a waitress who cooked the boneless ribs on a gas grill which was pretty tough to chew. Never ever go to Han-Il Gwan. It's mad expensive for the quality and quantity of food. The most notable conversation topic on the dinner table was the origin of the word "metrosexual." Mr. Jeon claimed he authored several books about it since he considers himself the metrosexual man. But then again, he also thinks he's a GQ man and a contributing editor to the magazine. I've seen the man dance when we were at Ice Cream, the karaoke place and I must say that it wasn't such a pretty sight to see a middle-aged, short korean man shake his ass. But he has character. I guess this is why it might be true that he had a blonde northern Italian girlfriend before he got married. He said he pushed her away because he had obligations to his parents.  After belting out an Eagles song, Mr. Jeon got emotional and started to tell us the young'uns that one never knows how life will turn out. With his long-time law school buddy incarcerated for sexual assault, Mr. Jeon said that never in his mind would he have foreseen this happen 15 years ago when they were innocent and fresh-off from college aspiring to be successful lawyers. Now with his friend being the defendant and he being the defense lawyer, Mr. Jeon found the situation so weird. He told us that the wife will definitely leave his friend and the kid is so embarassed of his father. I guess seeing younger people made him reminisce. Shortly after dispensing his two cents, Mr. Jeon and his friend took off.  We, the remaining young employees, took advantage of Mr. Jeon's generosity or the account the firm has at Ice Cream and sang till it closed shop. For some reason, everyone thought that I was such a good singer. That's definitely a first. In fact, Mr. Jeon thought that I go to karaoke all the time. Me? I can't afford it! He also thought I was more of a fob. Am I? Well, I guess I'm fob version 1.75. Can't really relate with the 1.5 crowd and I'm not born here so the midpoint would be 1.75. Also, when I go to work at the firm, I definitely do not dress down. Especially, today I wore a grey mock turtle neck that had a Fendi logo. You can't get any fobbier than that! I hope all the dressing-up isn't making me look older than I am. I wanna look young~!  Some time later, Mr. Choi called up his freeloading roomie to enjoy the spoils. Dang, that boy can sing. But he definitely could use better-fitting pants. They were baggy on top and the legs tapered so it looked like he had a huge butt.  When I came home, I smelled like smoke and korean bbq. This is why I can't hang with smokers whether you're a girl or guy. You easily ruin my washed or dry-cleaned clothes with just one puff. It's just annoying. Nothing personal. Besides, second-hand smoking is not only hazardous, it's inconsiderate.  Man, this month, there has just been an abudance of alcohol. 'Tis the season to be rowdy! Fa la la la~ la la la la~! I don't think I need to party this Christmas or New Year's. I just want to spend it quietly or do some light activity that doesn't involve booze. Just meeting few friends for coffee and having a talk would be great.  Dude, and I gotta get to work in 4 hours!   I'm never switching my factory work days.

      So I skipped the factory and went to the firm on time. I was insane enough to wear this really tight red leather skirt. During the whole 4 hours, it was me against my stomach. I was trying to defy gravity and other physical laws that seem to govern my body. Yet, there were some ogling eyes. Eyes of people who were old enough to be my uncles. Ah, my sad and pathetic life. Well, I'm supposed to show up for the firm's dinner soon. And I hope that they won't try to pry into my life. Thing is, I know it will happen. It always does when you're with fobs. It's like me who is down the food chain must entertain the boss with my life story for their amusement. Isn't it enough that I'm underpaid?

      I woke up late and called Daniel. Dan was not too happy to hear from me. He was late too and I sensed that he'd be hearing quite a bit from Gabe. Man, Gabriel needs to chill out. I know you're a perfectionist but gee, old man, it's doing you no good. It's great to be passionate about work but I think the anger and stress all the time is just ruining your health. Well, since I'm skipping the factory today, I will have to go tomorrow instead. I should really stop eating junk food late at night. I can feel myself expanding. Maybe I should pop in my Richard Simmons tapes and sweat the pounds off.

      After observing Hyobee's "farts" for a good few months, I decided to make my own "farts." For some reason, I have this desire to be heard so here it goes:   After my tete-a-tete with my mom on the way back home from court, I decided that I had to make plans for X-mas and New Year's. I have concluded that spending the holidays with family will ruin whatever good spirit I have maintained and just simply make me miserable. For those who have really good relationships with your family members, I applaud you. However, I'm not lucky as you so stop telling me to not give up on my dysfunctional and freaking family!   So I can't just do nothing and let it pass me by. That's what I did last year! I'm already 26 and I just ain't gonna let it happen without some form of bang. But since it's winter, what is there really to do other than get drunk somewhere warm? Maybe I should cook something all day. Pizza? Nah, it's cheaper to just buy the made ones. I wish I could ride a coaster right now. It would give me such a rush! O, Christmas and New Year's is a thursday! That means, most likely, the factory will be open and I will be working those days. Man, just like Thanksgiving! Ok, then problem solved. I'll just work hard and come home and do tons of laundry. Since everyone in my building will be out doing something, the laundry room will be all mine. Muahahaha!  I've been searching for the perfect frozen pizza. So far, DiGiorno served by Haena gets my two thumbs up. First candidate: Tony's. Tony's is just gross. Not only is the sauce too acidic, it lacks cheese and the pie dough tastes like they use lard. In fact, I felt like I inhaled lard afterwards. At least it didn't have weird holes like Jeno's which tastes pretty much the same like Tony's. I have two more candidates to try before I switch to DiGiorno. Or is it three? I'm just dead tired. Computer clock says it's almost 5 am. Damn, I wonder if I'll be able to make it to the factory and the firm on time today. I have been just awful at getting to work this week. Maybe the hangover from friday night is just lingering till death -- I just can't freaking wake up early!

      2003 has been very interesting. Thanks to Friendster the most wonderful thing since sliced bread, I have re-connected with old friends and attended one of my chum's wedding -- it was so beautiful that it made me cry. Moving to Jersey was another big event. It took time to enjoy my new surroudings but I'm so glad I moved here. Hopefully in 2004, I will make more friends that actually live in Fort Lee. Well, the flip side of moving to Jersey required of me to help my parents pay the mortgage off. I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life. I mean it stinks when you're working on a holiday but I no longer feel holiday blues or lonely. Working definitely makes me feel productive and looking at the diligent factory workers who labor 365 days nonstop positively inspire me to push myself even more. Despite the hectic work schedule and lack of sleep, I THINK I can squeeze some time to study or get ready to go back to school. Computer Science is definitely not what it used to be. I think studying business would be a wise or rather practical move. But most of all, this year despite the ongoing scratch fest, my AD or E has cleared up fairly well. Hopefully it will stay this way even during the humid summer. I have more confidence in myself and my condition is no longer a chip on my shoulder and in that sense, I feel triumphant. I have overcome my fear of people being alarmed by my E and it is unquestionably a milestone. Three long years of battling this horrific itch has definitely made me a better person. I've absolutely become more mellow, social skills have improved, and have become better at writing or rather expressing myself and I hope it just gets better.  Damn. I'm still trying to sober up from the party last night. I don't think I'll attend another New Year's club party. I don't think I enjoy being grabbed and kissed by strangers so much. Having whiskey, beer, and champagne all in one sitting can induce me to do some crazy things but next year I rather have a small house party. Actually, Haena wanted to go to Lake George and spend New Year's there. That might have been better. Besides, I had to pay $60 for that ghetto party. Drinks were served in plastic cups and the ratio of booze and number of people was disappointing. Did I mention that there wasn't much eyecandy? Heck, the girls were definitely better-looking. One thing I noticed was that when I dance, people give me this confused or stupefied look. They're shaking their heads, not knowing what to make of my dance and then they smile thinking, "Now, that's a weird chick." That's me -- Weird. Or to put it nicely, quirky. I want to make note of this cool chick I met. Her name is InSun (Peter's cousin) and she told me it means mellow tiger. She was definitely a laid-back tigress who can shake it. Maybe I should take dance lessons. One of my co-workers gives dance lessons on weekends. Maybe that'll improve my dance floor performances. Talking about co-workers, I met Stephanie on the floor. It was funny cuz she told me she had no plans for New Year's and she gave me the impression that she doesn't go clubs. Ah, yuhwoo. Why front? It'll all come out eventually.   As for resolutions, I want to push myself to exercise. Man, when I was grinding with Howard the Buff (the self-proclaimed 29-year-old but my guess is he's in his mid 30s), I felt so fat. Maybe he was too drunk and horny to care that he was holding onto my potbelly/pouch/love handles or whatever one would label it. And secondly, visit Hawaii with Hyobz!  Well, here's to 2004 (just my water bottle)!   I wonder what's in store for me.

      The cleaning crew, who stop by once or twice a month during the middle of the day, were using chemicals that were emitting some sickening fumes.  I felt like as though I had just doused myself with chlorine.  It was that acrid.    So after enduring such nauseant smell, one would expect a superbly clean bathroom.  Au contraire, mon frere.  The  unfriendly  wonderful cleaning crew failed to scrub the toilet bowls and wipe the sink and counters.  I mean, with all that chemical, couldn't they pour some in the toilet bowls and scrub 'em and spray some on the counters and wipe the grime away?  But the tiled floor is blindingly white and at least they took care of the previously urine-stained seats.    In other news, BlogSpot strongly feels that my blog is very pertinent to kimchi.  I've seen the same kimchi ads for days.  What gives?  Will even mentioning kimchi in my blog encourage more kimchi ads?  Hey, kimchi vendors: send me some free kimchi.  Preferably MSG-free.    And as you can see, I haven't been doing any productive work for days.  Yup, I've been just spending my time blogging.  Frankly, it's more entertaining than talking to people.  That's right; BlogSpot is my best friend.      ......

      Over lunch, Boss aka SK mentioned watching last night Obama speak at the convention.  I smirked when I first heard his name; it rhymed with Osama.    In any case, I was intrigued and searched the news.  I can see why everyone was so moved by his  urlLink speech .  It's rare to see a charismatic man like him this day and age.  His story demonstrates that America is still a land of opportunity where you can "achieve your potential."      Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope: In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen, a belief that there are better days ahead  . ..     I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.

      Had lunch with my boss.  He had Jirashi and I had some yucky eel special.    I don't know why he would take time to have lunch with me.  First of all, he eats fast.  I don't; I take my sweet time relishing the taste. Second, we don't necessarily discuss business.    So something purposeless like this puts me on the edge.  And I'd feel like I'm sitting on needles.  Hence, I'd get heartburns cuz I'm not chewing properly.    He's a busy man so I try my best to finish my meal as fast as I can.  This, as a result, entails sloppiness like no other.  Utensils clanking, liquids spilling, ...   You get the idea.  It's just embarasssing in addition to being socially inept.   Here's an example:  Last Friday when CK had his wedding reception on a cruise boat, I was a nervous wreck.  To say the least, I was constantly self-conscious.  Being at the reception brought back the awful feeling in the third grade.  My immediate boss SK sensed this and tried to help me out by encouraging me to imbibe large quantities of alcohol and asking his wife to talk to me.  Although his wife was a pleasure, it was just weird talking to your boss' wife.    You know how it is?  When you're being "social" with your boss, you're supposed to entertain 'em with stuff about you.  Never about the boss.  The boss can ask you what you did during the weekend but never vice versa.  In fact, you can see the startled expression when you focus the conversation on 'em.  But they LOVE examining you.  So that's why everytime I'm with my boss, it feels like I'm in a sterile exam room at a doctor's office draped in nothing but a paper gown.  Yup, you get the picture.  You feel really NAKED while your boss pokes and prods with all these not necessarily inappropriate but personal questions.  So you still think it's about morale?    When the subject of dating came up,   I immediately made up this story about Tony.  Supposedly we met at a party; I alleged Tony's solicitation as follows:                    Him:    "Hi, can I grab your ass?"                      Me:    "Um, NO."                  Him:    "Then can I have your number instead?"    And at that moment, me rife in hostility towards him, our oblivious, mutual friend came over and informed me that he was the aforementioned blind date.     Needless to say, my boss liked the story.  Then I told him all the factual details about Tony like where he lives and what he does.    Well, Tony DID ask if he can grab my ass when we meet; pretty much every time we talked.  So it deviates a bit from the truth.  Sometimes it's just better to tell a story like that.    And after all of that, I dread the next lunch.  Times like this, I hate being me.

      Continuing from the previous post   urlLink I'm back :    Yes, Mike was a challenge.  Let me explain.    So Mr. Hong was in Korea, aka Heaven for Straight Men, probably having the time of his life.  When I came to work, Mike was waiting for me.  After brief introductions, we were in Hong's office doing dictations.  I assumed Mike was in his late fifties since he had a Medicare card. I had to make a copy of it since it was being enclosed with the letters he was dictating.    FYI, Mike's Polish but he strongly pintpoints his one-quarter Irish heritage from time to time.  Especially on St. Patty's Day.  In March, he actually celebrated his Irish heritage at a local bar.  He invited Michael James his oldest son but I don't know if MJ rose to the occasion.    All Mike wanted to do was be able to see his daughter from his second marriage.  Maria, his ex (FYI Hispanic), has supposedly disappeared from the face of the earth for the last 5 or 6 years.  Even her attorney couldn't locate her when matters needed to be settled when Mike passed away in May. The latest contact attempt Mike made before he passed away was writing up a subpoena for the local Chase manager.  Since Maria had a Chase account, Mike figured Chase can help him out.  But Mr. Jeon never signed the subpoena and he probably never will especially since the client is dead.    When Mike's passing was revealed through a client on that fateful Monday, Mr. Jeon said that it's probably the only thing Maria wants to hear about in regards to Mike but nobody can contact her.    Perhaps Maria has heard of Mike through her parents who live in Fort Lee.  Before I left the firm, Mr. Jeon said he was gonna try contacting Maria's parents.  It's just sad that the girl will never know who her father was or is because most likely Maria will do everything in her power to make sure of that.    Mike did have other children from his first marriage with Donna (FYI Italian).  If my memory serves me right, a son and two daughters.    When Mike's mother tried to get herself appointed as the administrator for Mike's estate, the county surrogate court office told her that the children are the administrators by default unless they execute relinquishment.  So here's some advice, people: get your will in order.  If you have children, not even your mama can help you out.    Anyhoo, so when Mike's mother couldn't be appointed, she tried to get Donna's kids to take care of the estate and they all wanted nothing to do with their father.  Mr. Jeon told me one late afternoon that Michael James indicated that he doesn't care about "that bastard" otherwise known as his father.  So you get the picture, people; his children don't like him.    Now, in general, if your kids  hate  don't like you then most likely you're not a very likable person.  And that's how everybody in the office felt about Mike.  Mike, during his 5 or 6 years at the firm, had managed to piss everyone off but never got fired.  Then again, Mr. Jeon is not the type to fire.  I mean, Hyo Jin is the worst secretary you'll ever meet but she's been working there for two whole years.  On a side note: The woman knew how much I made but she never revealed the same; I was tricked, I tell you.    I'm so glad I left the firm.  Part of the reason I hated working at the firm was her.  Yup, she was that incompetent.  Her messages were illegible and did I mention that she always misspelled people's names?  You know, it really has nothing to do with being proficient in English.  It's just a matter of putting a little more effort or paying more attention to details.  Like Mr. Jeon said, her mind is always elsewhere.  ALWAYS.  Mr. Jeon thinks it's partly because she's an artsy person who studied dance.    When she'd ask for help, I'd find out that things are due in an hour or less than that.  She's horrible at organizing.  Sometimes Mr. Jeon would drive to court only to find out it was either the wrong date or the court date was postponed but she had failed to calendar in the correct one.    More to come...

I felt like my black sisters in that "Waiting to Exhale" movie.  If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.  I let out that "good" sigh before I hopped in.

      That's right.  After nearly 7 months of hiatus, I am back.  With a new template and  better  attitude!    Let me fill you in on why it took 7 whole months to get this blog going.  At the time, there was not a plethora of templates to choose from.  In addition, the comment feature was not available until recently.  And blah blah blah more "technical" excuses.  But this much is true: I was in search of a good and free comment feature.  HaloScan was on my mind but so were other things like MAKING ENDS MEET.  Not that I believe anyone was reading the crap I was writing but you never know.  And when I say "you," I'm pretty much talking to myself.    Since my last entry, here's what happened:  I got  fired   laid off from the laundry factory some time in February.  Yes I still had the  degrading  glorious  secretary  legal assistant job helping Mr. Hong sort through unorganized  crap  documents and getting a really vague grasp of the real estate business.  Here's what I learned from Mr. Hong: lawyers don't make money from real estate transactions.  There's just too many damn documents, parties, and procedures involved: the title agency, the bank, the real estate agent, the county, pre closing, the actual closing, post closing, the confusing HUD, and so much more.    The following day or week I find out that Mr. Hong takes off to Korea without telling me.  So since this was a part-time gig, I was left wondering if it's all downhill from here.  Fortunately, Mr. Hong still wanted to employ my services despite his absence.  The senior partner Mr. Jeon wanted me to aid Mike the "associate" lawyer who hasn't renewed his license since God knows when.  But I was just glad to make a buck.  What I didn't realize at the moment was that I was signing my sanity away for the next 5 months.    Mike ...  was a ... challenge.    More to come....

        urlLink     urlLink Quick Facts :  Kingdom: Animalia                    Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Artiodactyla Family: Hippopotamidae Genus: Hippopotamus Species: amphibius  Height: 60 inches Length: 156 - 180 inches Weight: 4000 - 8000 lbs Gestation: 224 - 259 days Offspring: 1 - 2 Life Span: 20 - 40 years Top Speed (Ground): 20 mph   The name hippopotamus means "river horse."     Really? But it's so fat.   When a hippopotamus opens its mouth very wide it may be trying to scare a potential rival away by showing off its canine teeth. These teeth can be 20 inches long. During a fight, male hippopotamuses will ram each other with their mouths open using there heads as sledgehammers, which brings their canines into play, and using their lower jaw to throw water at each other ... and death often results from fighting between males. Most adult male hides are covered with scars from injuries incurred during such fights.    Dang.   Losing males are often relagated to a solitary existence.   Same for humans too. Fat people are banished from society.   Although hippos may look cute or even amusing, they are among the most dangerous animals of Africa. The famous "yawn" (also shown in the photograph) is in fact a threatening signal!   No kidding. They're like Sumo wrestlers.   Hippopotamus is a valued food source for many of the native people of Africa. The meat is highly prized, as is the large quantity of fat obtained from the kill of a single animal. Hippos teeth yield surperior ivory, and the hide is also considered valuable.   I bet you there's a farm out there trying to domesticate this ferocious beast.   A hippopotamus is almost hairless, only the area around the nostrils and the tip of the tail have hairs on them.    Hey, just like men!  Well, here's what inspired all the research:   urlLink    Totally brings new meaning to "slap myself silly" and "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."  All together now! Come on.

But if the plane gets delayed, I might consider  urlLink this  at Newark to kill some time. But then again, I can't risk getting arrested; I gotta get on that flight. Maybe I can get Tony to do it.
