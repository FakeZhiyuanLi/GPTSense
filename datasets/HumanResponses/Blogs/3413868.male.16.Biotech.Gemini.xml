      Where's Rob? Go on, tell me, where's Rob? Here's Rob! Hello all, just a nice 'neat' post to introduce myself, My name is Robert, commonly known as  Rob ,  Robamatron  or  Roberto , to name but a few.  Little more to tell, 'cept to say that there is a blog-it gently nibbling on my left index finger (possibly Thworn, its hard to tell with these terrible lighting conditions), and that I'm actually feeling rather.. ..*yawn*.. ..tired....

      we were expanding the office the other day, and when we knocked through the wall behind Idow's desk we found a nest of what seemed like, small, furry animals.  woken from their seemingly prolonged slumber(s) they began erratically messing with all the computers.  we were all really tired and figured we were dreaming.  i woke up at about 5.00pm and found a messge on my desktop, telling me to create a blog, because the blog-its said so. there was also a link to www.blogger.com, so i got started and created the account; but since i was tired i got bored and stopped and slept some more.  i woke up again about, oh, let's say; 6.37pm, and found a small, yellow, smooth, smiley face sitting in my lap. it began explaining to me the cosmic implications of creating a blog for MMU, then introduced itself as Blog-it No 546873, mark 2... a.k.a. bob the blog-it. i was told that he was 'in charge' of the animals we found, and that he'd be giving input for the site, and the blog.   i never questioned him.   there is something soothing about bob's presence.  all the other blog-its sleep a lot, among those that wake, GIBBER, (the cute pink one), and THWORN, (who is a bit bossy but lovable all the same) are my favourites.    so here we are, the MMU blog.

      Wellow and Helcome to the new (and improved) MMU blog thing/majigga.  i'm really creating this for two reasons, one Bcos its easier to manage than the website, and two, because of server problems getting in the way of editing the main site (http://www.freewebs.com/myriad_ mess_up).  well here i am (using my new handle i might add) and here's my rundown on the situation: from my interpretation of all the ideas/phrases/insults/E-mails being 'fired' around the 'office' it would seem that Idow is insistant that we buy a car with seven wheels, (don't ask, we've tried, but he just doesn't listen) and the Blog-its are quite happy to go along with my plan to focus the new project on basically fun stuff and to have a less formal feel to the whole sh-ii-ba-ng.  Idow has a gun to pip's head... looks like we're going car shopping.  hey... where's rob?
