      Thursday was a nice day. in the morning we went outside to take some spectrail data on campus. we went over by the lib. we were using the ASD and i was opperating the computer. that took up the mornin and i left before lunch for an appt. Today we had already planned to go to the park and take data. it was very humid so we left after about 2 or so hours. we took data on some grass, moss, rocks, and some of the trees we had mapped out. the bugs were out and ppl were getting bite every few seconds. Lon was working with the D and P but i guess everything was too moist so every spectrum he took was the same.

      Today we went to Kodak. We got an interesting tour of various labs. We learned about upcoming software and imaging devices. The re-touching software and the stereo-something or another- were "MAD" neat! The elevators were also really fast! If RIT had them&nbsp;I would ride them everyday. The Cary500 is broken for the&nbsp; summer and the weather is still bad...

      well i havn't gotten around to doing my bloog most of the week so i'll update now. On wed we went outside and took measurements using the ASD. We measured a lot of the new bricks in the quad by the lib. After lunch we did some more work but volleyball got moved to wed cuz tues was thunderstorms. Yesterday David and I compilied a list of the rocks and minerals we knew were in Trona and Death Valley. That took most of the day, most of it was reasearch and organizing data in excel. Today we were assigined to find spectral data on the rocks that Beth and everyone else had measured using the SOC100 and SOC400. We finished that before lunch. After that i just did some more research on rocks and stuff but its very hard to find ne new information.  3things iv learned for the last 3 days.  1. i learned that if u use the&nbsp; '&nbsp; in excell it doesnt mess with the cell, like by changing it to a date or something. 2. i learned how to get to the fourth floor of the libary, very difficult 3. i learned that you shouldn't put nick tahos on ur lap, the grease likes to run off

      well today is tuesday so that means meeting and a lab. the meeting was interesting for the parts i could understand, too bad that was about 10 minutes of it. The lab we did was confusing again, but sarah and i did some extra work to see if it would come out better, it did kinda. umm today i learned that the theroy of magnification says it depends on the ratio of the lenghts, haha eat that

      i forgot rly what we did yesterday but i remember i learned the capitol of lousiana is baton rouge. I guess i also learned how to opperate the soc400 so it works better. Besides that i rly dont know i worked.

      the day starting off pretty cool, the DIERs interns went to the color lab to do some tests. We tested our color blindness on two tests, some japanese guys and the farnsworth just noticible difference. After that it was pretty much lunch time. We wanted to watch the jets flyin around but i guess we weren't allowed up on the roof alone and everyone was out to lunch when the planes were flying (IT WAS SO MUCH FUN NOT SEEING THE JETS). After that i just did some more research on death valley and other things.

      Well the morning started off with a trip to Lowe's again cuz of some ignorance we forgot to take account of. We finished making up the PVC System that we had to do and now all we need is to glue it together and find a good enough fan. Since Lons busy all afternoon I went to the hologram thingy which resulted in a tremendous failure probably my fault, tho the first few of us did get jipped into using old glass pictures or whatever its made on. After that both my undergrads went home so i decided to do some more research on Death Vally. Lon gave us a nice talk about how when he causlly askes for something he doesnt just want us to find it he wants us to give him something... pshhhh how was i suppose to know.

      today dave and i got instructions to create a system that will allow a substance, some type of liquid, to be injected into a air flow. We did research on the verturi formula and how its applied to tubing and such. After we had an idea of what we were going to do we headed on down to Lowe's to look at parts. There were some parts that seemed like they would work pretty well and matched up our plans. When we got back we talked to Lon some more about ideas and plans, he said if it was less than $50 total to just get it. I enjoy building stuff like this so it should be fun. Right now im just worried about the tubing melting from the air. If we have to we might end up using like metal that could easily handle higher temperatures but would also require more work. There arn't as many metal parts that would fit the design so we would probably have to do some welding (wonder if they would let me do that here)(FIRE HAHAHA). We're going to head back to the store in a bit and get prices for everything and see how much it would cost. It's pretty sweet being left alone to make whatever i think will work, this will really suck if it doesn't work.

      i guess since i didn't start this at the begining i'm missing some stuff. pretty much we toured RIT a little and learned what we would all be doing. This is a summer internship, for those who cannot comprehend the mass amounts of intense assumptions i have placed upon you all. pretty much i'v sorta learned how to opperate a bunch of different machines, ASD SOC100 more specfically ill probably end up doing stuff with the Carrie and the SOC400 but now all iv done is look at them and go "ooooo ahhh they're pretty!!". Besides that stuff iv realized that this job is pretty cool, its fun to mess with things i have no idea about.

      Today we worked on a lab. It was sort of confusion and tedidous. We got it finish with a little time to spare and waited for lunch (This is when I made this bloog :P ). After lunch we did some work then played volley ball. Hey it's Tuesday so thats what we do.

      Monday: I went outside with the ASD to collect spectra on white cars. Lon was already out there getting permission from the people who owned the cars. After lunch we went over to camp Eastman and used the ASD on tree bark.  Tuesday: Tina, Dave, and I did our power point presentation (some of it). Then we got eye tracked playing DDR, I really sucked. Volleyball after. I learned how to sand down the spectralon.

      Well today we had to test the ASD to figure out what was wrong with it. We spent time just taking test measurements, wiggling, turning on and off and various other things to try and reproduce the same errors from the days before. It was working fine which seems like a good thing but probably isn't, because if we dont know whats wrong with it its kinda difficult to fix. Most of the dirs ppl are taking a 6 hour day so there was no lunch. I learned some more on the ASD spectral software and a few things on webdesign that jesse was working on.

      today started off with some meaursments on the ASD. it was just another set of the blue tarp we've been working on for the last few days. this time it was 8layered,  one all tops and the other alternating between top and bottom. the ASD was acting up a little today but we still managed to take all good measurments. after that we processed the data from tuesday and sent it to Lon. When we came back from lunch we processed the data from today and sent it out. too bad we had to do all that stuff in the morning because it was fairly nice outside, thought not good enought for the 3degree. I figured out how fully work processing data today and how to make graphs and export them to jpg files.

      wed morning we took another tour of the campus cuz lon brought in a high school student lookin at the college. i think i can find my way around pretty good now. After lunch we came back and processed all the data from the last few days. We also worked on the blue tarps, and remade the measurements we did from before. Something seems to be affecting the ASD because there seems to be a lot of noise sometimes.

      Like all tuesdays we started off with out dirs meeting. this time it was on what the water team was doing. althought there wasnt much data presented the ideas and what they were going to do seemed pretty cool. After the meeting we did our lab. it seemed short compared to the others, maybe it was just a little eaiser to understand. or maybe it was that there wasnt repetitive trails that take a long time. either way doesnt matter, we made some good coments. We went out to lunch cuz its tuesday but volleyball isnt looking to good, stupid rain.

      today we went to camp eastmen all day. it was rly nice and clear skies. we were able to use the 3 degree floor optic for the ASD, first time its been nice enought to do it. If we get another day like this we'll be lucky. We'll probably just end up potato mashing for the rest of the summer. I used the camera for the day. Taking pictures of the samples and ppl taking measurements. after lunch we went to iridiquiote (yes i know thats not how you spell it but its summer). We only spent about an hour and a half after lunch taking measurements of the pavement, dirt, and tennis courts. O ya in the morning we measuring the fields as we walked in a line across them. Today i learned how to use the Camera, woot. It was a rly good day compared to the others espcially being outside all day. (haha to all you people inside).
