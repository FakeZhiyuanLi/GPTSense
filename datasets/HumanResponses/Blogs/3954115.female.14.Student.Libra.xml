      Yes the sun has come back again for now. I got to the oldham match last night was really a waste of my time the football was a shambles we lost 3-2 we are now bottom of the table and starting another season of low crowd attendance and bad football. However some of our new signings were quite good Rodney Jack in particular gave 110% last night and i need to give him credit for that. Todat has been a good day i have met the pais worker hu will be based at our church from septmeber he is called lee, 18 from N.Ireland. He is a cool guy and will fit in with our group at chruch fine. Infact he more or less is one of us already. Other tahn meeting lee i haven't done much today apart from sat in front of the tv and go on my pc. God Bless Katie

      Yes we have had lot more rain in oldham, so much so the match tonight might be called off. I haven't looked after my nephews today i got the job of looking after my sister instead. Not done much as i have been stuck inside, i had a food fight whilst making chocolate muffins that was fun. Tomorrow i am meeting the pais worker who is going to be based at my church from september. If you are not surewhat a pais worker is they area a sort of youth worker, they go into schools and do assemblys and things, but they are also based at churches at the area in which they are working. We are getting a lad called lee from N. Ireland which hould be good although we might scare him as we are all quite mad at our church. It will also be quite confusing as we have someone called lee at our church already but we will get round thta be giving them nicknames. Anyway not got much else to say God Bless Katie

      Yes it is bucketing it down here in oldham! So i am stuck inside doing nothing as the rest of the family are at work. I t was really hot yesterday and my church was packed as we ahd 3 christianings and 3 comfirmations so we all spent time sweating it out. I sawone of my nephews on saturday along with my brother and girlfriend. Micheal is really getting big now and is crawling everywhere, he is trying to walk but hasn't quite got there yet. I am hpefully going to be spending the day with my nephews tommorow and then going to watch oldham in the first home match of the season. They need a win or they will be at the bottom of the table as they have already lost one match. Soul in the city went great from what i have heard from people and God has really seemed to have moved through London. Soul survivor is happening next week so if anyone is going to that have fun. I leave for athens on sunday, i'm quite nervous because i don't like flying and there is a high terroist threat but i'm sure God will keep me safe and i am going to try and make the most of the experience and enjoy watching the olympic events.  God Bless  Katie
