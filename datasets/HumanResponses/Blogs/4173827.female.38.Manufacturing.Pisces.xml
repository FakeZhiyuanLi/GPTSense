						   I had a dream last night. It’s been a reoccurring dream of mine for quite some time. I dream of rooms. Many rooms and I roam from room to room looking at everything in it with wonder. These rooms are new to me and I am delighted when I discover a new one.  Enter Ty Pennington from Extreme Makeover Home Edition. Okay not bad, now this dream is getting good. He seems to be barking orders here and there and starts telling me I need to go look for more rooms.  All of a sudden my family at the curb-side and I hear him say “bus driver … hit it”. Then I woke up. BLAH!  They’re coming to my house, I KNOW they are!

						   Well it's coming. That much I know for sure. So today Victor takes me to the wig place at our local hospital to get me a new wig to wear for when my hair falls out. I had spotted that wig months ago on my numerous trips past the store.  All went well and we bought the wig.  I brought it home and the children were curious.  MacK: What's that hair in there for? Me: It's a wig. MacK: No it's not, it's HAIR!  I then put the wig on so the kids could see it.  Noah could not stop laughing at me.

						   MacKenzie, my three year old, never ceases to amaze me with her humor.  MacK: I want to go outside  NOW! Me: You can't Kenzie, Bonnie is out there. MacKenzie makes her way to the sliding glass doors MacK: There's not anyone out the window. Me: It's raining right? MacK: yeah! Me: That's Bonnie  I get a very mixed up look from a three year old.  Noah, my four year old, is a very thoughtful and imaginative boy.  Noah: I have a brother Me: WHAT? Noah: I have a brother Me: What's his name? Noah: Tek Me: Tek? Noah: Yeah. Me: And where is Tek right now? Noah: At the doctor. Me. Why is he sick? Noah: No he's just there for a check up Me: Oh and do I have to feed this brother of yours too? Noah: Yep. Me: And where does Tek sleep. Noah: In my bed, that's why I have the white pillow. Me: Oh good, because I don't think I could fit another bed in your room.  Yet another child I sent away with the look of total confusion.  Sometimes, it's fun to mess with your kids' heads.

						   It's funny how the mind works with the body. It has never ceased to amaze me what I have been able to do with my mind since I was about 10. I think I was walking home close to Christmas holidays and I knew I was in trouble for something. I really don't remember what. So I faked sickness. So much so that my temp went up to 104 and I have Xmas pictures to prove how sick I truly became. Coincidence?  Why does the mind have so much power over the body.  So I start me first day of chemo. Get some good anti-nausea meds put in me and then start with fluids. Then comes the first drug. Red Kool-Aid someone else called it. The nurse said to me "knowing you, you'll be calling it the Red Devil". I couldn't look at it going in. That was followed by the second chemo drug and then the rest of the fluids. Then there was all this talk of nausea, and how they are going to give me this and that drug to take up so that my first chemo experience is not bad.  I get home and sleep. I wake up a little hungry and start to eat. I grazed and didn't want to over do it. A half an hour later, despide three meds ... well you guessed it. Power of the mind? Was I subconsciously thinking about the word "poison" as I had referred to my chemo before hand? What does our body do to rid itself of poison?  I've always been in tune with my body. Looking back I knew the cancer was there before I found the first lump. I just denied it.  I now listen to every signal I get no matter how small.  A lesson, listen to your body and don't think yourself paranoid because the mind can do some weird stuff sometimes.

						   Have you ever looked back on your life and could pin point something that changed your life forever. Did you see it coming? I'm not talking about positive life changes like the baby you have 9 months to prepare for or marrying your true love. I'm talking about the car accident that, although you walked away from it unhurt, it still ruined your day and caused you to have post traumatic stress syndrom months down the road.  I'm sitting here the day before my first chemo treatment. No big deal right? Wrong! I thought I would be okay with it all. Afterall, together Victor and I chose this course of treatment for my breast cancer. We wanted to kick it in the balls and not give it a chance to come back. So why am I sitting here freaked out by the thought of losing my hair? It's only going to be gone for 4 months or so. It's not like it's going to be gone for ever.  Yet here I sit scared out of my wits. I guess it's because I'm not prepared. I only have one or two scarves, my survivor buffs and a hat or two. This was going to suffice as I was sure I'd be okay with just covering up my head. But then I got to thinking. What is the first thing I think of when I see a bald lady covering up her head with a hat or scarf. CANCER. I don't want people to look at me and think that. I want to remain as I am.  Another factor that scares me about chemo is the effects the poisons have on my body. No more mentral cycle, onset of chemopause, oh joy hot flashes that I can't take estrogen to counter. Losing my memory. The one thing I pride myself with. My very clear and great memory. I remember things for everyone. What will I be able to retain once I start chemo?
