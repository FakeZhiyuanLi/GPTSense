      I had never read any Joe R. Lansdale before two weeks ago, and brother, have I been missing out.  Actually, that's a lie. I've read his comic book collaborations with artist Timothy Truman, of whom I was a fan from such books as  Grimjack  and  Scout . Their works together have included a  Lone Ranger and Tonto  mini-series, and three  urlLink  Jonah Hex   mini-series (one of which got them  urlLink sued by Johnny and Edgar Winters ).  I greatly enjoyed the Old West as portrayed in these comics. This wasn't the cleaned-up Old West of John Wayne films, nor even the somewhat darker version in more recent, "revisionist" Westerns such as  Unforgiven  or  Tombstone . This was closer to Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti Westerns, where dirty people had ugly teeth and uglier morals. Of course I loved the art, but the writing was also fantastic, and while I may have been aware that Joe Lansdale was a well-established novelist, I didn't bother seeking out any of his other books.  That was a mistake, which I have at long last remedied, by reading Lansdale's  Bad Chili  and  The Magic Wagon  back-to-back.   urlLink  Bad Chili   is the fourth in a series (up to six, so far) of crime novels featuring Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. (Why did I start with the fourth? Only one my liberry had.) Hap is a down-on-his-luck, '60s agitator turned offshore oil rigger, and his best friend Leonard is a gay black Vietnam veteran, too surly to even keep his bouncing job. And, to give you a feel for the tone of this book, when we meet them in the first chapter, Hap gets savaged by a rabid squirrel:   We broke and ran. The squirrel, however, was not a quitter. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw that it was in fact gaining on us, and Leonard's cussing was having absolutely no effect, other than to perhaps further enrage the animal, who might have had Baptist leanings. Probably the best way to describe this book and its flavor, the blurbiest way, is "Elmore Leonard in East Texas." Or Carl Hiaasen, or Tim Dorsey, or whichever of that Florida crime novel cadre you want to use.  Bad Chili  isn't a detective novel, nor an adventure story, nor really a typical crime novel. Its cover describes it as a "novel of suspense", but that still doesn't quite get it right. It simply is what it is, which mostly involves weird and dangerous things happening to two good ol' boys.  As with the Florida novelists I mentioned, it's not the plot that matters; the plot is just an excuse to create vivid and memorable characters, have crazy stuff happen to them, and give them rich, distinctive, hard-bitten, hilarious, colorful, quotable dialogue. My favorite line in the book: "He had an expression on his face like a man who had just been told he was going to have to swallow and pass a bowling ball, then bowl a strike with it."  Lansdale is the guy who wrote the story the film  Bubba Ho-Tep  was based on, so, if you've seen that, maybe you've got an idea of what I'm talking about here.   urlLink  The Magic Wagon   is an earlier, lesser effort, but still enjoyable. It's a Western, and it involves a traveling medicine show, Indian mysticism, surreally malevolent weather, and the mummified corpse of Wild Bill Hickock. Its tone is much tamer than the other book --  Bad Chili  has non-stop foul language, a thoughtful but very frank approach to sex, and much more brutal violence -- but it still ain't for kids.  Lansdale is a real discovery for me, one I should've discovered much sooner. I plan on going through as much Lansdale as I can find in short order, starting with the remainder of the Hap and Leonard series.  Caveat: Lansdale uses the "n-word" in his books. And he uses it a lot. A  lot . Same with any number of gay-directed epithets. Does he use them in a manner accurately reflecting the speech of certain real East Texans, both modern and historical? Yes. Does he use them in a prurient fashion, for cheap shock value, in an irresponsible way? No, absolutely not. He makes it very clear that the people who use those terms are generally vile, ignorant, racist, homophobic buffoons. But, for those with more delicate sensibilities, it's perhaps best to be aware of that little fact going in.

      I've been mostly disappointed with this summer's run of  The Drew Carey Show , the finale to its nine seasons on the air. That a show I once loved, a show that once burst with originality and humor, should exit in such an ignominious fashion in the first place is dispiriting enough. But even worse is the fact that they're not even  trying .  A note on why a whole season's worth of new episodes is being burned off like this over the summer: about three years ago, when  The Drew Carey Show  was riding high on the Nielsens, as was Drew's side project,  Whose Line Is It Anyway? , ABC, which had recently suffered through the  Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?  implosion, desperately wanted to keep one of its few remaining non-game or -reality show stars onboard. So they threw a boatload of cash at  The Drew Carey Show , in the form of two entire seasons bought in advance. Funny thing happened, though, when the first shows of that first prepaid season aired: they tanked.  Hard.  So hard, ABC yanked the show off the schedule midway through the season, and aired the remaining episodes during the dead of last summer, under the radar, with next to no commercial promotion, as stealthy as a ninja graverobber.   Fall 2003 comes around, and ABC finds itself in quite a bind. They've got  another  entire season of  Drew Carey  bought and paid for, but they don't want it anywhere  near  their fall premieres. I don't know  why  ABC even allowed the filming of this final season to occur; perhaps they figured they'd recoup  some  of their losses in summer commercial money, perhaps Drew Carey himself, or the show's production company, insisted on the shows being made to add to the lucrative syndication package. Either way, here we are, burning off an entire season over the summer hiatus, two episodes per week.  As I said, though, the real sting comes from the lackluster effort everyone involved in the show is exhibiting. The writing, which used to take chances, and go off in unique and experimental directions (the musical episodes, the April Fool's episodes, the live, semi-improv-ed episodes, the hilarious "special" episode, in which every single melodramatic sitcom cliche was exploited in a blatant bid for Emmy attention), is rote and uninspired, and the performances from the actors -- it would be generous to say they were phoned in. It's more like they're communicated via tin cans attached by waxed string. They all know they're lame ducks, killing time until they hit their quota of episodes, and they all act (or  fail  to act) accordingly.  Drew Carey was never a gifted actor, and as he stumbles and fumbles over his lines in these episodes, ruining punchline after punchline, you can almost see a weary, baggy-eyed, half-drunk director behind the cameras chanting, "Keep rolling, keep rolling." But it's the real comedic core to the show that disappoints the most: Ryan Stiles as Lewis and Deidrich Bader as Oswald. At one time, they were one of the best supporting comedic duos ever to hit the TV screen.  Ever . Now, the ennui of the production has sunk into their performances as well, and their chemistry, their timing, their sheer joy have all taken a hit. They, like everyone else, are waiting for this zombie of a show to realize it's dead, and stop moving once and for all. The only life shown by a performer this season has come from guest stars Michael Gross ( Family Ties ) and Susan Sullivan ( Dharma and Greg ) as Kellie's wickedly self-absorbed, vicious, alcoholic parents. Now  that  was a funny episode.  The major storyline of this final season doesn't help things any: Drew has gotten girlfriend Kellie pregnant (the lovely but in-over-her-head Cynthia Watros, who can't come close to matching even the half-assed comedic mania of Stiles and Bader; that said, she's  still  a better actress than Christa Miller, whom she replaced last season -- and who, strangely enough, is showing more comedic talent in her occasional guest appearances on  Scrubs  than she did in seven seasons on  Drew Carey ). Plus, Mimi's son Gus is getting storylines of his own. So the majority of this summer season features child-based humor. The last refuge of the creatively bankrupt.  I offer a fond farewell to  The Drew Carey Show , an important and influential member of the modern sitcom family. It's just a shame it didn't get the chance to go out in a blaze of glory (as  Friends  and  Frasier  did this year), instead having to suffer through an extended, painful, and largely unheralded death. RIP.

      I rewatched my  Spider-Man  DVD today (after a  urlLink day of panic  in which I thought I had lost it). Loved it, as always -- but there's still one thing that bugs (ha!) me about it:  Why does  everyone  call May Parker "Aunt May"??  Peter, I can understand. Technically, she  is  his aunt. You've got me there. But why Mary Jane? I mean, do you call  your  friends' relatives Aunt This and Uncle That and Cousin The Other? If so, why? (And what kind of name is "The Other"?)  And, strangest of all, why in  the  hell would  Norman Osborn  address her as Aunt May? He's a  grown man , for crying in the night. A corporate giant, a titan of industry. Why would he refer to his son's roommate's aunt as if she were his own?  Weird.  Next to that, a radioactive spider doesn't sound all that implausible.

      You know what I like?  urlLink  The Station Agent  .  I watched it for the first time on DVD this Saturday, and I now wish I had gone out of my way to see it in the theater (out of my way is usually the  only  way to see limited release independent films in Ventura County, so close and yet so far from L.A.). I loved it completely.  It stars Peter Dinklage as Fin, a train hobbyist and a dwarf (that's what he calls himself in the film, not my stab at a politically correct term -- I don't have the slightest idea  what  the P.C. term is these days), who inherits a small train station house in a New Jersey backwater. There he meets the endlessly chatty and charismatic Joe (Bobby Cannavale, in a star-making performance) and the klutzy, emotionally turbulent Olivia (Patricia Clarkson, who was Oscar-nominated for  Pieces of April  the same year  The Station Agent  came out, 2003, but could just as easily have been nominated for her work here), who almost runs Fin under the wheels of her SUV, not once but  twice , in a side-splittingly hilarious sequence.  Fin is an angry and closed-off man, maybe because he's different, maybe for other reasons; his only love is for trains, and the train station he lives in. He shuns Joe's friendship as best he can, but Joe eventually wears him down with his limitless reservoir of goodwill (when Fin won't let Joe join him on his ritualistic train track walk, Joe insists, "I'm a good walker, bro"). And Olivia soon becomes the third member of this unlikely team, partly through her attraction to Fin, partly through Joe's well-meaning manipulations.  Peter Dinklage (whom Cannavale amusingly refers to in the DVD commentary as "Dink," which seems a tad too close to "dinky," but how can you resist making a nickname out of "Dinklage"?) is the anchor; his character is a thoughtful, deliberate man, and as an actor, he never allows the film to proceed beyond the character's pace. He controls the movie with his performance, and it's an excellent one. In a remarkably short time (short enough for you to lose the urge to say "no pun intended" every time you use the word "short"), you forget there's anything different about Fin -- although he can't let himself forget.  Patricia Clarkson, I'll be honest here, I've been in love with since  The Dead Pool . Yes, the last Dirty Harry movie. (Damn, that was 16 years ago. I guess Dirty Harry couldn't survive post-Reagan.) And I've never loved her more than I did in this film. For one thing, the director has allowed her to be sexier here than in any other role I've ever seen her play; she was 42 in this film, but you don't doubt for a second that both Fin (Dinklage was 33) and Joe (Cannavale, 31) could fall for her. (Hell, I did, all over again.) She's a strikingly intelligent and beautiful actress, and I hope her bounty of well-written parts from 2003 carries over into this year and beyond.  And Bobby Cannavale is a genuine discovery. And I'm guessing he's  been  discovered, judging from the four feature films he's got lined up for release in 2004. He's  so  effortlessly charming, it's hard to believe he's acting. Even when you fear he's becoming too competitive with Fin for Olivia's affections, you still can't help liking Joe unreservedly. I look forward to seeing Cannavale in whatever his next release may be.  Nothing blows up in this movie. Nobody gets shot. The only death is from natural causes. It's a slow, quiet film, but it's got a wonderful sense of humor that grows as the characters develop (the first time Fin allows himself to make a joke, you laugh half from the humor, and half from the release of tension), and the small town setting is gorgeous. The four main characters are all people you'd like to get to know better (that's including Michelle Williams of  Dawson's Creek  as the town librarian, who has a relatively minor but pivotal role), and when the film ended, I wished I could spend more time with them.  It's the small things in this film that will win you over. I'll let you decide whether the pun is intended or not.

      You know what I love? TiVo.  I used to say the debit card was the greatest invention of the last 100 years. (One card! And it does  everything ! It's  magic !!) Well, TiVo is  better , my friends. Great TiVo, giver of life.  Every second with my TiVo, I rue the 32 years of my life I spent without it, wasting my time on useless crap like reading, socializing with friends, moving my muscles, etc. I would take TiVo intravenously if I could. I would stick it in my earholes and smoke it in a pipe. I'd bake it in a cake and eat it. I like it, all right?  Plus, I've got it in conjunction with DirecTV, which allows you to TiVo  two  channels at once. That one channel at a time nonsense is a sucker's game. You gots to get the two-channel hook-up, dawg. Get this: you can record two channels at once,  and  watch a third, previously-recorded program  at the same time . It's like seeing the face of God.  So, as an intro to the kind of TV lover I am, and the truly sickening amounts of time I spend watching it, here's a list of all the programs I currently have on my TiVo's Season Pass list (which automatically records every new episode, bless its little electronic heart).  1.  The Amazing Race 5  (beginning next week; best of all the reality shows by far) 2.  The Shield  (previously #1, but the season just ended; it's my favorite show on the air) 3.  Arrested Development  (one of the two best sitcoms currently airing) 4.  Scrubs  (the other one) 5.  Coupling  6.  Alias  7.  Gilmore Girls  8.  Smallville  9.  The Daily Show  (next to  The Shield , my favorite show; it's not higher on the list because there are so many repeats -- if an episode doesn't get recorded due to conflict with a higher priority Season Pass, I can always catch the next airing) 10.  Justice League  (gotta dig that Flash) 11.  Teen Titans  12.  Dinner for Five  (if you don't get IFC, you're missing out) 13.  Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law  14.  Ebert & Roeper  15.  Joan of Arcadia  16.  Insomniac with Dave Attell  17.  South Park  18.  Kim Possible  (yeah, that's right,  Kim Possible . It's funny, okay?) 19.  Late Night Poker  20.  Monk  21.  Star Wars: Clone Wars  (no new episodes any time soon, but I keep it on here so I don't forget) 22.  Celebrity Poker Showdown  23.  Less than Perfect   And this by no means is anywhere  near  the total list of programs I watch.  The Simpsons ,  Enterprise ,  The Drew Carey Show ,  Futurama ,  Family Guy ,  Aqua Teen Hunger Force ,  Sealab 2021 ,  World Poker Tour ,  Match Game ,  Dave the Barbarian ,  Iron Chef ,  That '70s Show ,  Survivor ... really, it's enough to break a weaker man's will. But I persevere. Nay, I thrive! And I do it for you, so that you don't have to.  But you should. TiVo's really, really cool.

      So this is my blog. Blame  urlLink Ian . In order to comment at his excellent new comics blog,  urlLink Brill Building  (which, technically, is non-capitalized -- "brill building" -- but I'm far too anal to let that sit), I had to register here at Blogger.com. And then I figured, as long as I'm already registered....  You know what I like? Probably not, is my guess. Lots of stuff, is the short answer. Long answer is what I plan to post here. All my flavorite TV, movies, books, comics, music, video games, and miscellaneous additional crap that falls under that semi-dignified descriptor "Pop Culture." It's a much more respectable term than "Stuff I Can Enjoy Without Having To Get Off My Fat Ass," which, while possibly more accurate, won't move as many plush toys.  Ideally, I'll post every day. But as this world is less than ideal, let's chuck that idea out the damn door  tout de suite . Less ambitiously, I'd like to post every weekday, with specific days set aside for different aspects of the Culture we call Pop: Mondays for movies, Tuesdays for TV, Wednesdays for books, Thursday for comics, and Friday, potpourri. (For example.)  Realistically , I'll post whenever I damn well please. Hell, this may be my first and last post right here. If I don't make my every-weekday schedule, well, as the  urlLink Dread Pirate Roberts  once said, "Get used to disappointment."  Oh, also, I hate a lot of stuff. Lots of stuff. Lots and lots and lots of stuff.  Lots . I plan on posting about some of that, too. Because, after all, it's often the  urlLink most negative reviews  that prove the most memorable. And funniest. But I'll try to keep it to a tolerable minimum of blackest, vilest vitriol. If I can.

      COMICS: Reading the  urlLink  Bone  one-volume collection  is  exhausting . It's 1300 pages long, and thick as a cinder block, and it weighs more than a Thanksgiving turkey stuffed with ball bearings. I've been getting quite a workout just from cracking it open. And the page size is slightly smaller than a regular-sized issue, which means I have to strain my eyes more than usual. This thing's gonna take  forever  to read. Let me put it in perspective for you: if I read one issue per year, it will take me FIFTY-FIVE YEARS to finish this book.  Yeah. You see what I mean now.  Also, even after the many years it's been since I read the original issues, I can still pick out some of the revisions Jeff Smith has made for this collection. And I'll tell you, I don't mind the odd reworked sentence or two... but all that hardcore porn he added is really jarring. I'm not sure I would've made the same choice, were I in his shoes. Well, to each his own.  Oh, no, wait, I was reading  urlLink  XXXenophile  . My mistake.  MOVIES: Tough decision this weekend:  urlLink  The Village  , or  urlLink  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle  ? Possibly  both , if I pull a theater-hopping double feature tomorrow. If I have to choose:  White Castle  wins. I love M. Night Shyamalan's films, but this one's been getting some bad reviews, and I'm just not as much in the mood for a moody, suspenseful period piece as I am for a stoner comedy.  But the one movie I can't miss this weekend is  urlLink  Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism  . I'm not even sure  how , because I thought Murdoch had gotten an injunction against this film, but it's playing at my local theater on Sunday, one show only. It's all about how Murdoch blatantly uses Fox News as a promotional tool for the Republican party, with stolen footage from Fox News illustrating exactly how they advance that right wing agenda (which is  why  there is/was an injunction against it). From what I hear, the documentary as a whole is fairly amateurish, but when it gets to the Fox News footage, it's  stunning . I can't wait.  TV:  Celebrity Poker Showdown  next week features  urlLink Amy Poehler . I love Amy Poehler. That is all.

      I need to update my links list. But it's so damn tedious.  Firstly, I need to create a sub-category, as  urlLink Mike  has done, for the Associated Comics and Pop Culture Webloggers of Ventura County, CA and Outlying Environs (aka Dudes I Know in Real Life), which include  urlLink Dorian ,  urlLink Corey , and  urlLink Ian .  Speaking of Ian, his entries about his experiences at the SD Comic Con have been linked to by  urlLink Mark Evanier's News from me  and  urlLink Heidi MacDonald's The Beat , which is pretty frickin' cool. I'm so jealous. Not only does he make the Con pilgrimage, but he's also getting linked all over the place for it. (Not as jealous of the links as Mike was [insert smiley face here], because I've actually had the distinction of  urlLink being name-checked in Mark Evanier's blog , too, back before I had a blog to link to. If you click that link, I'm the only Tom mentioned on the page... and yes, that's my real last name. No jokes, damn your eyes!)  I also have to note which of my blog links are represented on the  urlLink Comic Weblogs Update  page, and which are not. I've been neglecting visiting those blogs which don't appear on the Update page, and that's just wrong.   Also  also, I must take up Milo George's  urlLink generous offer of amnesty from SquirrelNation  (even though I think my position as  urlLink Pope of the Holy Squirrel Empire  may trump his secular rank of General), and add  urlLink The Unofficial John Westmoreland Memorial Tribute Webring  to my links, while I still can.  If only Blogger had an easier method of adding links than having to alter the template for my entire blog. Frankly, it's more trouble for me to change the links than it is for me to just bitch about it like this.

      I forgot to mention: I got the phone book collection of the complete  Bone  series, because apparently I have poor impulse control.  I've heard people talking -- mostly negatively -- about Jeff Smith's penchant of returning to his comics and altering them for the trade collections, a la George "Greedo Shoots First" Lucas. Word is Smith may even have altered his previous alterations for this new phone book (like the upcoming Special  Special  Edition DVD of  Star Wars ). Might even alter them again for the future color Scholastic collections.  I don't really know  how much  has been altered; it's been a  long  time since I read the original first few issues (if I have the originals, why did I get the phone book? Because I only have the first 20 issues or so; after that point I decided I would wait for the series to end and collect the trades -- smart move!), so I have no way of knowing off the top of my head if he just fixed some misspelled words, or tidied up some glitches in the art, or actually made wholesale changes to the story. My impression, though, is that the changes aren't very drastic, and won't affect my reading. Normally, I'm a stickler for the original version of anything, but if Smith has made the book a little better in his eyes  without  ruining it for the reader (I'm looking at you again, Lucas), I'm just fine and dandy with that.

       Avengers : As a long-time  non  Avengers fan, I don't even know what to make of this. I'm totally buying it only because Bendis is writing it. Okay, before anything else, I have to say, TWO double-page spreads of the Avengers Mansion blowing up seems  excessive . I barely know most of these characters, but Bendis does a decent job of giving them personalities before the shit starts to fly; the Hawkman/Madame Hydra bit is funny and believable, and got an extra kick from his turning it around on She-Hulk (even though I know from her own comic that she doesn't even live in Avengers Mansion anymore... details, details). So, Ant-Man's dead. Moment of silence, please (in which I try to remember who the hell Ant-Man is. I thought Hank Pym was Ant-Man. Who's  this  guy? Was he the guy dating Jessica a year ago in  Alias ?). And the Vision crashes into the Mansion, melts like the Wicked Witch of the West, and coughs up Ultron hairballs. Cool.  All that's interesting enough, but it's the personality changes in other characters that really intrigues me. What is making Tony Stark feel like he's drunk? What is driving She-Hulk berserk (and causing her to rip the Vision in half and pummel Captain America senseless -- which, as bad as the situation is, was still completely  badass )? This issue has gotten me hooked. I'll stick around for more of this Disassembled nonsense, even though I  hate  crossovers and don't really care about the Avengers. By which I mean, I'll stick around for the books written by the  good  writers, like Bendis and Kirkman. (Assuming Kirkman's next issue of  Captain America  is better than his first.)   Powers : Am I supposed to remember who this new girl who's dressing up as Retro Girl is? Cause I don't. Is this a character that was introduced ages ago, or is she brand new, and I shouldn't feel bad about not recognizing her? Second issue of the reboot wasn't as excellent as the first; Oeming's art looks rushed in places, and Bendis draws out the interrogation scenes a little too long (Bendis padding a story? Shocking!). But it's still a good issue.   The Walking Dead : The new artist is starting to bug me. Tony Moore was so excellent at creating detailed, individual characters; with Charlie Adlard, I can hardly tell one character from another. Which bearded man is  this ? And Kirkman's foreshadowing was a little blunt: Carol is suddenly content, and accepting of things she had so recently condemned; I'm sure she's going to live a nice, long, happy life. As long as a zombie doesn't eat her face... oh, DAMN!! Didn't see  that  coming!!   Fantastic Four : This storyline had potential in the beginning, but I was disappointed with this finale. First of all, strange as it may be to say it, what with my constant criticism of the padding of Marvel arcs out to unnecessary lengths: this issue felt rushed and crowded; it might have been better with one more issue to wrap things up. Then again, that might only have added one more unenjoyable issue to the story. Waid seemed to lose his control of the villain characters; instead of the interesting individuals they started out as, they fell back into corny villain cliches at the end. I stopped caring about Cole and stopped believing in her mini-romance with Johnny. Glad there's a new story next issue.   Astonishing X-Men : Last week, it took me forever to remember one of the comics I had bought. Same thing this week, and this was the comic.  Still  not astonished by it. The art, yes; the art is gorgeous. But the writing... I  want  to like it, because it's Whedon, but I just don't. The conflict in this issue is  especially  contrived: I didn't for a  second  believe that Wolverine and Beast would attack each other full-out, claws bared, smashing through the walls of the school, because of that stupid serum. Not for a  second . It was so blatantly, "we need a fight scene, who would it be cool to see fighting?" And would any student, anywhere,  ever , actually ask a teacher, "Are you a fucking retard?" (And not get the shit kicked out of him.) I guess I'm sticking with this book because I want to believe it  could  be great, even though it isn't even close yet.

      So I finally decided to find out my  urlLink True Squirrel Name , like all the cool kids are doing (and by "all," I mostly mean  urlLink this guy , aka General Smallnuts, as linked to by  urlLink Mike , aka Nibbles Wobblebottom).  And my True Squirrel Name:   Pope Nuttykins .   Pope , people. I'm the Squirrel Pope.  Bow down before the leader of the Holy Squirrel Empire!! Convert, heathens, or face the sharpened point of my... acorn?

      Have you ever been reading a book, and enjoying it a great deal, but then, when you set it down one night, you feel absolutely no desire to pick it up again the next day?  That's happened to me with  Lolita , which thankfully I eventually forced myself to pick up again and finish, and  Infinite Jest , which maybe  someday  before I die I might get back into. But I never thought it would happen to me with Terry Pratchett's  Discworld , the most entertaining series of books I've ever read. Especially not two books back-to-back.  The first was  urlLink  Monstrous Regiment  , what you might call a  proper  entry in the series, about a woman who disguises herself as a man to join the army, and discovers that she's not the  only  one to do so. It was very funny, with even more than the usual complement of colorful characters (a troll, a vampire, a zombie, a werewolf, an Igor), and a bevy of satisfying confrontations and resolutions, and it featured Commander Vimes, perhaps my favorite recurring character in the  Discworld  universe. And yet, somehow, I set the book down and didn't pick it up again for months.  The second was  urlLink  The Wee Free Men  , which I bought the week it came out, in April 2003, and just finished tonight. The delay in finishing is all the more embarrassing when you consider this is the second of Pratchett's  Discworld  books for  children . It took me fifteen months to finish a children's book.  Not that I spent fifteen months reading it. It took about a week, with a fifteen-month pause in the middle. I can't explain why, but again, I just set it down and couldn't pick it back up. It's a fun book, about a young girl, Tiffany, a witch-in-the-making whose brother is kidnapped by the Queen of the Fairies. She must rescue him with the help of the Wee Free Men -- the pixies, here called the "pictsies", tiny blue belligerent creatures who accept Tiffany as their leader. The pictsies are the most entertaining part of the book, with names like Rob Anybody and Daft Wullie and (my favorite) Not-as-big-as-Medium-Sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock-Jock, and their thieving, drinking, fighting ways accented by their deep and sometimes unintelligible Scottish burr.  I love Terry Pratchett, and I love  Discworld . I can't understand why I'm having such troubles finishing his books of late. Maybe it's because I've slowed down on  all  my reading; the internet's probably at least partly to blame for that. After spending an hour or two online (which I do most every day), I'm more inclined to want to rest my eyes than pick up a book. Also, I blame TiVo. Sweet, wonderful TiVo. You should see a list of the books I've started and not yet finished, or, worse, bought and never even opened.  There's a new Pratchett book out right now,  A Hat Full of Sky , which is apparently the sequel to  The Wee Free Men . I'll pick it up soon -- I  have  to; as slow a reader as I may be these days, and as many books as I have stockpiled, Pratchett is still a must-buy. I just hope I finish it sometime this year.

      I love TV Poker. I love that it's everywhere right now, so much so that it's pissing off non-Poker fans. I love that at almost any given time of day, I can find Poker on the dial, whether it be the  World Series of Poker  on ESPN or ESPN2, the  World Poker Tour  on the Travel Channel,  Late Night Poker  on Fox Sports Net,  Celebrity Poker Showdown  on Bravo,  Dogs Playing Poker  on the Animal Channel,  Liquor in the Front, Poker in the Rear  on the Food Network,  Hitler's Deadliest Poker Games  on the History Channel,  For the Last Goddam Time, Anna Nicole, a Flush Beats a Pair of Fives  on E!...  Okay, I'm making up some of those. But Poker is  everywhere . And now, as if there weren't enough televised card games already, GSN (formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken) recently added the  World Series of Blackjack . Hell, Blackjack is barely interesting when  I'm  playing it, and the way the tournament is set up, whatever fun might've been had is forcibly removed. There's a set number of hands played (30, I believe), and limits are set on the maximum bets allowed, so everyone plays this incredibly dull, conservative, chip-conscious game, where, unless you bet  really  foolishly and actually lose all your chips early on,  nothing  matters until about the last three hands. And yet, I  still  enjoy watching it.  I didn't think there was a card game you could put on TV that I wouldn't watch.  Until GSN came up with  urlLink  Celebrity Blackjack  .  Sweet, merciful  Zeus , is this a train wreck! And not the exciting, exploding, twisted steel, bodies flung from windows into orphanages kind of can't-look-away train wreck. This is a train wreck with Jamie Kennedy and Eddie Griffin trading alleged "wisecracks", Hal Sparks thinking of his hilarious appearance in  Spider-Man 2  and pretending not to be humiliated, Dean Cain gamely tolerating  MAD TV 's Alex Borstein cracking  Lois & Clark  jokes old enough to join the AARP, Melissa Joan Hart appearing to be in actual physical pain from adding up her cards kind of train wreck, which means this is the kind of train wreck where you have to shield your eyes, plug your ears, stick your head in the sand, and pray the world is enveloped in nuclear fire before you have to watch one more second.  If that sounds bad, consider that "Hollywood" Dave Stann, the single most obnoxious card player in the world, and the reason why watching the regular  World Series of Blackjack  was often a chore, serves as the  dealer  in  Celebrity Blackjack . Which means his inflated ego is in direct competition for screentime and quip quotient with celebrities who didn't make the cut for  Celebrity Mole , and are therefore fighting for attention as though their very celebrity lives depended on it (which they do). It's a pissing match in which  you  are the receptacle. And if that sounds unpleasant, trust me: the reality is much, much worse.  People: "Stuttering John" is one of the "celebrities" on this series. Fortunately, I didn't have the displeasure of witnessing  that  episode -- I could  barely  watch the one episode I ran across, let alone the entire six (I think) episode tournament. But when "Stuttering John" is elevated to "celebrity" status, it's time to turn off the lights and lock the door behind you. This show is a travesty on the level of  Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire? , only, if we're all very, very lucky,  no one  will remember  Celebrity Blackjack  five years from now, not even the participants.  I didn't care for it, is what I'm saying.

      MOVIES: I don't think I made this entirely clear on  urlLink my previous entry , but in addition to mocking the  Showgirls  special edition DVD, I also truly, sincerely  covet  it, and plan on buying it this weekend. Damn right!  COMICS: Because I'm now listed on the  urlLink Comic Weblog Updates  page (and proudly so, I might add), I kind of feel some pressure to post a little more frequently about, you know, comics. So, in the beating a dead horse department:  Eightball  #23.  When I  urlLink posted about it a couple weeks ago , my entire review consisted of:   I liked it fine. It made me a little sad. Louie was kind of a dick. And I wasn't kidding. (Well, not much.) I mean, it's a good comic.  Very  good. What little I've read of Clowes' stuff has had the rare ability to make me  feel  something when reading a comic (most often, melancholy and a squirming discomfort... which is probably why I haven't read  more  of his stuff -- those aren't pleasant feelings in large amounts). I think he's really quite an excellent comics creator.  That said, I don't get all the hoopla. The comics "blogosphere" (I'm still lacking a better, non-idiotic term) seems to have risen up as one and decreed  Eightball  #23 its new lord and master. As I said in that previous post, this comic is being as infinitely praised and minutely deconstructed as if it were a newly discovered James Joyce novel.  I don't see all that. It's very smart, very enjoyable, it makes you laugh, makes you cringe, it's an insightful look into a troubled mind. But it ain't  Ulysses . Or even  Watchmen . Is it better than most comics? Is it the best single issue of the year? Maybe, maybe. But even so, I can't see writing a thesis on it.  Maybe that's why I don't write about comics more often.  TV: Last night on Bravo I caught a repeat of Kathy Griffin's stand-up special,  urlLink  The D-List   (which, by the way, isn't even listed amongst her credits on IMDb.com -- that's odd). Basically, from her vantage point as a minor, minor celebrity ("For a while I was hovering around the C-List, but once you do 'Celebrity Mole' it's straight to the D"), she talks shit about all the better-known and infinitely weirder celebrities she encounters in her professional life, from a weepy, John Lennon-quoting Sharon Stone, to a menacing, profusely sweating Whitney Houston, to a near-comatose Anna Nicole Smith. And I  loved  it. You  know  there are millions of sick and twisted stories about the Hollywood elite floating around, and Griffin is your direct access to those stories. The humor flows naturally from the bizarre people and situations; she barely even has to craft punchlines around them, they're so hysterical to begin with.  The caveat is, you have to be able to take Griffin herself in order to enjoy her storytelling. She's got a grating, raspy voice, an abrasive, aggressive, sometimes flighty delivery ( "Oh I forgot to tell you this!!" ), and a far-too-chummy attitude with the audience. I can see how some might be turned off right from the beginning, and never even give her act a chance. Personally, though, I enjoy the whole package, and I'd really like to see this turned into a series of specials. I'll bet she's got enough stories to produce a new hour at least monthly, maybe even a half-hour weekly.

      Classic cinema fans rejoice: Tuesday sees the eagerly-anticipated release of the special-edition DVD of:    urlLink      The only thing that could make this better would be if the cast of  Mystery Science Theater 3000  reunited for the commentary track. Although I find it hard to believe even  they  could make this movie any funnier.  Highlights from  urlLink the story about the DVD release :   Among DVD extras are a tutorial on how to give a lap dance and audio commentary titled "The Greatest Movie Ever Made."  "It seems like this great lost Pinter scene where subtext is everything, until you realize that there absolutely is no subtext. They're just talking about eating dog food." And my favorite line (italics mine):   Berkley took the worst of it for her garish masquerade as a stripper turned Vegas showgirl, but the movie also was a career low for co-stars Kyle MacLachlan and Gina Gershon.  The actors declined interviews for this story .  No!  They  declined  interviews about the most wretched, humiliating experience in their careers, and quite possibly their lives? Shocker.  Where the hell  is  Kyle MacLachlan, anyway? Gina Gershon survived relatively unscathed, and even Elizabeth Berkley still gets parts in high-profile films, bless her naughty little heart -- but man, poor Kyle. Before  Showgirls , he absolutely was on the upswing of stardom, well on his way, I think, to becoming a genuine box office draw. Now, can you even  remember  the last film he was in that debuted on more than a dozen screens, if not directly on cable? Sad.  (And no, I'm not counting his role on  Sex and the City  because 1) it's not the movies, and 2) I hate that damn show.)  But at least  Showgirls   also  destroyed Joe Eszterhas's career, which was a boon to mankind.

      I have very rarely laughed as hard at any film as I did at  urlLink  Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  . Hell, I saw it  twice  over the weekend, and laughed just as hard the second time. The film is uneven in spots; some bits go on for too long, and one or two bits just don't quite work at all. But when it works, it's  hysterical .  The main reason, of course, is Will Ferrell. Let's face it, he's the new comedy kingpin. And it's about time. After far too long being the best thing about very lousy movies (the SNL sketch-based  Superstar ,  The Ladies' Man ,  A Night at the Roxbury ), he is now the best thing about very funny movies ( Elf ,  Old School , even his brief appearance in  Starsky & Hutch ). And all is right in the world.  As funny as Ferrell is, though -- as much as he is the star of the film, like his Ron Burgundy is the star of 1970s San Diego TV news -- to his credit, he's surrounded himself with some amazing talent. Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana ("I know what you're thinking: 'Does he have a nickname for his penis?' And the answer is yes. I call it the Octagon.") is note-perfect; Rudd, like Ferrell, has often been the best thing about very lousy movies, and deserves to be a much bigger star than he is. David Koechner as the slightly-too-fond-of-Ron Champ Kind is also a riot. And Steve Carell as the incredibly dense Brick Tamland steals every scene, as usual. (When Brick doesn't understand why everyone is yelling, but still desperately wants to join in, he resorts to screaming, "LOUD NOISES!!!") Fred Willard, Chris Parnell, Fred Armisen, and so many others I can't name without spoiling the great surprise of seeing them pop up... it's a surplus of comedic firepower. Oh, and Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone is okay, too, I guess.  (I actually felt a little bad for Applegate, whom I think must have experienced the same pressure on the set of the film as her character does  within  the film: she's entered a very close-knit men's club, and she has to fight for every laugh she gets, and those laughs usually only come by playing off the men.)  The story, about an all-male TV news team invaded by its first female reporter, is silly to begin with, and a great deal of humor is mined from these ridiculously set-in-their-ways chauvinists dealing with a woman (Brick: "I heard their periods attract bears!"), but the film often goes way,  way  over the top, as in the cameo-studded full-scale newscaster battle scene, complete with medieval weaponry,  Planet of the Apes -style horseback net attacks, and severed limbs (cameo newscaster, on having his arm chopped off: "I did  not  see that coming!").  Sometimes the craziness goes on a little  too  long, as in that battle scene, or a cartoon trip to "Pleasure Town," but in at least three scenes, the film nails the exact level of craziness necessary for maximum hilarity, and had me laughing so hard my sides were hurting, and I could hardly see the screen from the tears in my eyes.  The first scene is when Brian Fantana mistakenly believes his "Sex Panther" cologne will allow him to seduce Corningstone. The horrible odor has the exact opposite effect; she wonders aloud at the rancid stench: "It smells like a dirty diaper filled with Indian food!" (From around the newsroom: "It smells like a turd covered in burnt hair!" "It smells like Bigfoot's  dick! ") The second comes when Burgundy, heartbroken over a tragic event, calls Fantana from a phone booth, and dissolves into incoherent shrieking -- no words can capture Ferrell's side-splitting hysteria in this scene. I haven't laughed so hard in a theater since the "franks and beans" scene of  There's Something About Mary . I'm still laughing now, just thinking about it. And the third scene is played entirely in subtitles, and I don't even want to say anything more than that about it, other than to note that it demonstrates that the film, though heavily reliant on Ferrell, is actually very funny independent of him as well.  But, yes, Ferrell is the main reason to see this film. He's never hit so many notes so well. From the wild emotional breakdown I mentioned above, to the subtler laughs garnered with just a brief sentence or a gesture, he's non-stop funny. Some of his funniest bits are derived from his plain-spoken, obvious reactions to circumstances. When Fantana douses himself in "Sex Panther" and proudly says, "60% of the time, it works  every  time," Burgundy's immediate deadpan response: "That doesn't make sense." Of  course  it doesn't, but somehow only Burgundy is aware of it. Or when Burgundy is stumbling around the streets, broken and disheveled, drinking from a carton of milk: "It's so  hot . Milk was a bad choice." Or when he leaps into a bear pit at the zoo: "I  immediately  regret this decision."   Anchorman  would've been very funny if everyone had adhered strictly to character, and the events had played out in some approximation of the real world. But the fact that the film allows itself to take these absurd detours into the utterly illogical is what pushes it over the top into a new comedy classic. I can't  imagine  a funnier film being released this year.

      Saw  Anchorman  this weekend. I'll post a full entry about it tomorrow, but for now, a couple short notes on the previews that accompanied it.   urlLink  Christmas with the Kranks  : Based on the book  Skipping Christmas  by John Grisham, starring Tim Allen and Dan Aykroyd, and directed by Joe Roth, the  auteur  behind  Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise . This film won't be released until Thanksgiving, but I appreciate the studio showing a preview for it in July. This way, I can fit in four entire months of hating it in advance!   urlLink  Catwoman  : You know your movie's prospects are dim when they have to show  previews  for it after it's already been  released . The FX look  terrible , the fight scenes are from the "if we use a lot of cuts, the audience will  think  something exciting is happening" school of filmmaking, and when you can say the best thing about a movie looks to be  Sharon Stone , and you're not talking about  Basic Instinct , you are talking about a very bad movie indeed.   urlLink  Collateral  : If I never hear Tom Cruise's grating, braying, "I'm-totally-on-the-edge-dammit!" laughter again, it'll be too soon. And what the hell is up with that hair? That said, Michael Mann has directed some excellent movies, I'm not entirely against the idea of Tom Cruise as a villain, and I will even admit the possibility that Jamie Foxx won't totally suck. If it's a slow week, I'll check it out.   urlLink  Without a Paddle  : I think Seth Green is very funny. I think Matthew Lillard is very funny. I think Burt Reynolds appearing in a film about three friends getting lost on a river-rafting trip is a very funny riff on  Deliverance . However, I think this movie will suck at least seven different kinds of ass.   urlLink  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle  : If, after having seen  Dude, Where's My Car? , you'd told me that I would be eagerly anticipating that director's next film, I would've busted you right in the chops. Right square in the chops, sir! And yet, here we are. This looks  hilarious . A very stupid kind of hilarious (the kind  Dude  promised but couldn't deliver), but hey, sometimes that's exactly what you're looking for in a comedy. Even my  mom  laughed at the trailer, and she hardly  ever  gets stoned anymore. And Ebert & Roeper just gave it two thumbs up, with Roeper calling it one of the funniest films of the year. Two thumbs up for a teen stoner comedy? That may be a sign of the apocalypse. Count me in!

      You know what I hate? That series of Charmin commercials in which a cartoon bear takes a crap.  Have you seen these? Apparently inspired by the phrase, "Does a bear shit in the woods?" the  urlLink Charmin people  have gone one step further: "Does a bear wipe its ass after taking a shit in the woods?" The answer, according to the series of ads dubbed (I'm not joking here) "Call of Nature": yes. Yes it does. (And it  urlLink doesn't use a rabbit .)  Now, if you just had the cartoon bear cuddling and squeezing the Charmin, as human shills for toilet paper do, that would be fine. But Charmin apparently thinks that  anything  a cartoon does is cute. So, in the first of these commercials I ever had the displeasure to witness, we see a bouncy, pastel-colored, happy cartoon bear stepping up to a tree, ensuring the Charmin is near to hand (paw), hunkering down in a squat behind the tree  oh my good lord is that bear doing what I  think  it's doing??   Next we get a close-up of the bear's face, which is creased with the concentration of one passing a truly  heroic  load out the back door. And then:  bliss . The bear's face lights up in ecstasy. At long last, after all those years of having to drag its ass across the gravel, the bear finally has  urlLink t.p. for its bunghole ! And clearly the feeling is  heavenly . Oh, what delight the bear is experiencing, smearing Charmin brand toilet tissue across its filthy, stinging, dung-encrusted sphincter!  This is one of those commercials that, intentionally or not, disgusts and alienates its target audience. Much like those Carl's Jr. ads, in which a cast of mannerless idiots revel in making a revolting mess out of their gooey, dripping, nauseating meals, with the tagline, "If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face." Those commercials, rather than making me hungry for Carl's Jr., filled me with  urlLink great vengeance and furious anger . Not only did I never ever  ever  want to go to Carl's Jr. ever again, I actually wished I never had to eat anything for the rest of my life. These Charmin commercials have the same effect: not only will I never buy Charmin, but I think I now actually hate my body and its natural functions a little bit.  Thanks, Charmin! Thank you and your defecating cartoon bear!

      I caught the commercial-free premiere of the Denis Leary comedy/drama  urlLink  Rescue Me   on FX on Wednesday, and... I may have built it up a little too much in my head. It was very good, don't get me wrong, but I think I was expecting to be blown away on the level of  The Shield 's premiere, which is a near impossible standard to meet.  It opened with a great establishing scene, Denis Leary's  Full Metal Jacket / Patton -esque speech to a group of NYFD cadets, with Leary setting the overall mood for the episode: a lot of tough talk masking a lot of pain just beneath the surface. We witness the pain almost immediately after Leary leaves the cadets: he gets a visit from his cousin, a firefighter who died at Ground Zero. "You know what they found of him?" he's just gotten through telling the cadets. "A finger. That's all. A finger." His cousin's appearance only externalizes Leary's haunted soul -- and it's well-played. It could've come off as very cheesy, but Leary's cousin -- and other "visitors" -- keep things interesting with the same rough humor and tough-talking bravado of the living firefighters. (In a later appearance, the cousin tries to pop open a beer can. "Dammit," he says, struggling with the task, "it had to be my beer-opening finger.")  Of the tough talk, we get a plethora throughout the show; the cursing pushes FX's already liberal standards, with plenty of racial epithets (wop, jewbag) and homophobic slurs thrown in to boot. The show doesn't shy away from portraying these firefighters in a less than flattering light; they don't take kindly to outsiders, or any variation from their narrow definition of acceptable behavior or appearance. A telling exchange comes late in the episode between Leary and a therapist sent to the fire station to offer counseling to those still reeling from Sept. 11. When she questions him on the lack of female firefighters in the station, he says he'd be fine with one on his team as long as she could do the job. But then he adds:   "You got a Martian, or a cyborg, or a Chinaman that can do the job, bring them on, too." " Are  there any Chinese firefighters?" "Yeah, probably. Somewhere in... China." That he would equate a "Chinaman" with inhuman creatures is no slip of the tongue. It's obvious anyone deviating from the norm is going to find some very rough going in this club. It's a bold and probably all-too-truthful way to present the NYFD. I'm assuming this is establishing a baseline mindset which will evolve as the series progresses -- but by small increments at best.  Leary's character is a heavy drinker and is getting divorced -- which isn't a far cry from his character in his previous series,  urlLink  The Job   (which was cancelled way too soon), in which he played a pill-popping, philandering cop. The role isn't a stretch for him, and Leary doesn't have the acting skills to stretch much beyond the niche he's built for himself (he co-created both series), but that's fine, because it's an admirable niche. He takes public servants, for which he clearly has a great deal of respect (as evidenced by his charitable contributions), and humanizes them, shows them not only as heroes (a label they wouldn't want to apply to themselves, anyway), but as real and flawed human beings. And he does it with a great deal of dark, even  mean , humor. (In  Rescue Me , Leary terrifies his fellow firefighters by throwing a child-sized doll from a burning window.)  Where the show didn't hold up for me was in the actual firefighting. It's tough to stage a realistic fire on film, and I think they err on the side of caution here; the one fire the station responds to doesn't convey any of the excitement or danger we've been led to expect. It looks like what it is, a few small flames staged around the actors.  And the rest of the cast, with the exception of Leary's wife (played by Andrea Roth, whom I remember from last year's excellent comedy series  Lucky  -- which I'm still mad at FX for cancelling), are fairly indistinguishable so far, ranging from the gruff ladykiller to the gruff chief to the gruff... other guy who's gruff.  But these are small complaints. I enjoyed the first episode a lot, and I only expect the series to get better. It's a great addition to the FX library, which is rivalling HBO in great original series on a non-broadcast network. The big networks better watch their asses; by playing it too safe, they're giving viewers like me less and less reason to visit the single-digit channels at all.

      Slow week for me at the comic shop. Other than the  Hush  TPB I wrote about yesterday, I only got three comics, which is probably a change for the better; I've been spending way too much on comics recently. Yeah, like I'm really gonna cut back.   Plastic Man : Glad Kyle Baker is back. I think I'm going to enjoy this story more than his first arc. It's lighter, goofier, funnier, more enjoyable over all. No hint of that jarring darkness Baker introduced in the early issues: who wants to read a Plastic Man story involving the gut-wrenching death of his best friend Woozy Winks? (Sure, Woozy got better, but still -- it was Plastic Man with an  edge , which is so wrong in every definition of the word.) Seeing Abraham Lincoln slap Wonder Woman's ass in this new issue was definitely worth the cover price.   Ex Machina : Good, smart stuff. And, hey, here's Abraham Lincoln again! Slightly different context, though. Now  that  was a bit shocking, wasn't it? I enjoyed that central debate -- is it right to censor something that has the potential to provoke actual violence? -- but it felt like an extended tangent, irrelevant to the story. Are they going anywhere with this? I also enjoy that the superhero costume only appears in flashback: I'd rather see how a superpowered mayor deals in politics, than see just another costumed hero. Brian K. Vaughn is now officially one of my favorite writers, with this and  Y: The Last Man . I may even have to check out what he's done with  Ultimate X-Men  when the TPB comes out.  It took me forever to remember the third comic I got was  Daredevil . That probably doesn't say much about its entertainment value. I don't like that Ben Urich's uninformed diagnosis that Matt Murdock had a nervous breakdown has been so readily accepted as fact -- especially when, if you buy that theory, it took years for the breakdown to manifest, it  lasted  for more than a year, and upon Urich's diagnosis, Murdock apparently instantly cured himself by driving away his wife. And I've tolerated it for so long, but I finally reached the breaking point this issue: Alex Maleev's artwork is  ugly . It's an eyesore. It makes the book a chore to read. I unequivocally hate it. If I drop this book -- and I'm getting fairly close to doing so -- it'll be 10% because of Bendis' story, which is, as always, padded to the breaking point, as well as patently ridiculous (Daredevil declares himself Kingpin and crime in Hell's Kitchen disappears -- because I guess now he's  really  beating up criminals, as opposed to all those other years he only  kind  of beat up criminals), 90% that hideous art.

      So, I finally picked up Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee's  Batman: Hush  -- or, at least, the first five chapters in trade paperback form. And, after that whole yearlong frenzy over the way they had revitalized Batman, and what a ripping good story, and blah de blah, I gotta say: this is what all the fuss was about?  Really?   This?   I know, I can't judge fairly, having only read five of the twelve issues that make up the story -- but here I go anyway.  First of all, let me complain about the story being published in separate volumes in the first place. What a blatant money-grubbing scam. DC couldn't fit a measly 12 issues in one TPB? If they don't release the remaining seven issues in one book, if they actually plan on splitting this into  three  volumes, I think I'll decide, to hell with DC, and to hell with this story.  I'm almost at "to hell with this story" as is. And people complain about  Bendis  padding his stories! I mean, lots of characters do lots of things, but the actual amount of story that was advanced in this collection could've been easily condensed to one,  maybe  two issues. But Jeph Loeb loves showboating, he loves building issues around a particular character on the cover, so that his anemic plots can be stretched out over a year. Been doing it since  The Long Halloween . His ongoing series,  Superman/Batman , is less gimmicky in that fashion, but even there, he loves his guest stars, and he loves taking his sweet time.  I think Loeb is vastly overrated as an author. He's better at generating attention with "events" than at the actual writing part of the job. His dialogue and his stories are often corny, awkward, heavy-handed, ridiculously flamboyant, repetitive, and humorless.  No, but tell us what you really think, Tom?  He does sucker me in with the events, though, I have to admit. Over in  Batman/Superman  (which one is supposed to be billed first? Do they take turns every other issue?), I loved the return of Lex Luthor's green and purple power suit. I loved the return of Supergirl (at the beginning, before it started dragging). And, though I didn't buy the single issues, I couldn't wait for  Hush  to be collected in a book (a  softcover  book, screw that hardback nonsense) so I could see what all the buzz was about.  And  this  is it? The mysterious villain the whole story has been built around, Batman's bandage-faced nemesis, has so far committed the diabolical acts of... cutting Batman's bat-rope, and shooting out one of his bat-tires.  Ooooh,  what a chilling menace he is!  Meanwhile, there's a bunch of nonsense about Killer Croc and Poison Ivy either knowingly or unknowingly working for "Hush" (that  is  what they wind up calling the villain, isn't it? Because, in the five issues  I've  read, he  still  hasn't been named), and flashbacks built around Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Tommy Elliot that scream "red herring"  so  obviously that I'm jarred out of the story each time ("Just try and kill me," says young Bruce to young Tommy; "I can always think like you," says young Tommy to young Bruce; "Lay it on a little thicker, why don't you," says I to Loeb). Plus, Batman punches Superman and makes out with Catwoman, which, frankly, is fan fiction-level wish fulfillment. "Dude, wouldn't it be  sweet  if Batman used kryptonite to fight Superman??  Again???  And, like, he should  totally  bone Catwoman, too!!! I am  so  gonna post that on the forums tonight!!!"  Plus I hate the sound effects. Yes, that's right, I'm nitpicking at the sound effects. A writer writes all the sound effects in a comic, doesn't he? Look at some of the ones Loeb uses: DUSCHK, HAMD, BAX, SWAG ("SWAG"?), BDOK, BERKSCH, DUSSHK (maybe that's just a misspelling of "DUSCHK"), DTUSH. Those aren't sound effects, those are bad draws in Scrabble. I mean, "HAMD"? That's the sound of brass knuckles to Huntress' skull? "HAMD"?  And  everything  has a sound effect. Batman's batarang has to go "ZIP" not once, not twice, but  three times  around Croc's mouth. A knife cutting a newspaper has to go "SLIKT" (twice). A doctor opening the door to the O.R.: "BOOM". Me reading the 8,000th sound effect in three pages: "ARRGHH!!"  Other than that, though, it was okay.  Because there's the art. The  art . I'm not enough of a cynic about that whole Image crowd to deny that Jim Lee does some damn excellent artwork. (Almost, though -- my disdain for Todd McFarlane and Rob Liefeld runs pretty deep, tainting many of those around them as well.) That's a lot of lovely detail, and some great, inventive, visceral action scenes. And he sure do love drawing women's asses, don't he? Jim Lee is why I'll get the next volume of  Hush .  Let me remind you, by the way, that I  don't know  how this storyline ends. I've intentionally avoided as much internet chat about it as possible, and despite the fact that I already found out there's some Jason Todd stuff coming up (that was nice and subtle, by the way, having bandage-face stand next to the first five letters of the sign on the "Robinson's" building in issue 3), and despite how much I've complained about the writing -- try to avoid spoilers if you comment. Thanks.

      Better late than never, yesterday's promised book review:  If  urlLink pirates are the new monkeys , then mentally-challenged savants are the new pirates. Released on the heels of  urlLink  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  , about an autistic math genius turned sleuth, Steve Martin's (yes,  that   urlLink Steve Martin ) novella  urlLink  The Pleasure of My Company   chronicles the life of Daniel Pecan Cambridge, pathological liar, OCD sufferer, math genius (he creates giant  urlLink magic squares  to help calm his nerves), and loner.  Daniel is a prisoner of his compulsions. He can scarcely leave his apartment for fear of having to cross a curb (curbs are highly illogical to him, and thus highly forbidding), and his relationships with people are nearly non-existent (he even ruins his chance at a sexual encounter with his upstairs neighbor by leaving her stranded in the bedroom while he makes sure the wattage of all the lit light bulbs in his apartment adds up to 1125). And the relationships he  does  have are riddled with fabrications and fantasies. He convinces himself he is in love with Zandy, the woman who fills his prescriptions at Rite-Aid; Elizabeth, the realtor handling the apartment building across the street; and Clarissa, the student therapist who visits him weekly.  After constructing an elaborate relationship with Elizabeth in his head, Daniel finally arranges to meet her, but as his mental tics manifest, Elizabeth becomes disgusted. Daniel assures himself (only half-jokingly) that he can't be held responsible for his failure:   ...Elizabeth was at fault here. She had destroyed whatever was between us by making a profound gaffe: She met me. But that illusion won't hold; he later admits to himself, apropos of the distance his mental disorders force him to create: "There are few takers for the quiet heart."  The book, and his relationship with Clarissa, both take a surprising turn when she unexpectedly shows up at his apartment:   ..."Could I ask you a favor?" The request held such exasperation that I worried she had used up all the reserve exasperation she might need on some other occasion. Clarissa is having troubles with her abusive ex-husband, and needs to leave her baby son, Teddy, with Daniel while she deals with things. She instinctively knows what the reader has come to learn, that despite the lies he can't control, Daniel is a trustworthy person. And so Daniel, whose world is ruled by logic, is suddenly in charge of a highly illogical being. The neuroses which have kept him locked up are challenged by Teddy, and this first step leads him on a greater journey outside of himself.  Martin is no Hollywood opportunist, publishing a book just because his name recognition allows him the luxury to do so. He's a gifted writer, as those who have read his previous novella,  Shopgirl , already know. His dialogue is humorous, sad, sweet, and real, and his descriptive prose brightens even the mundanity of Rite-Aid:   The merchandise inside broke the light like a million prisms. Candy bars, laid out like organ keys, glistened in their foil wrappers. Tiers of detergent boxes bore concentric circles of vibrating color. The tiny selection of pots and pans reflected elongated sideshow images. Green rubber gloves dangled from metal racks like a Duchamp, and behind it all was Zandy's yellow hair, which moved like a sun, rising and setting over the horizon of ointments and salves.  The Pleasure of My Company  is a wonderful book, smart, subtle, funny and wise, deeply observant of human nature, its triumphs and failures.

       urlLink "Well, the one thing with writing stories about the rise of fascism is that if you wait long enough, you'll almost certainly be proved right."   Great, extensive interview with Alan Moore at Salon, in which the interviewer says Moore is not just one of comic's finest writers, but one of the world's finest writers, period. Salon is always great about giving due respect to the comics world, as opposed to the "Biff! Zowie!" comics articles you usually see in mainstream press.  Those of you without subscriptions to Salon will have to get a Free Day Pass to read the interview, but it's worth the 30 seconds or so you'll have to spend watching an ad.

      TV: What  The Amazing Race  is lacking in teams to root for this year, it's more than making up for in teams to hate, which is just as fun. Charla and Mirna are on the top of my list: little person Charla for constantly insisting how strong and independent she is, then manipulating others into feeling sorry for her and helping her, and complaining when they don't, and Mirna for being such a bloody  victim , such a  martyr . Everything that goes wrong happens because other people are out to get her, because something is being done  to  her, as opposed to simply resulting from her own weakness and incompetence. "Now we're lost, because we trusted somebody," she said in last night's episode. No, you're lost because you were driving the lead car and you were stupid enough to miss the turn. How is that the fault of the car  following  you, whose driver  did  make the right turn? Answer: it's NOT! Ya freak.  Also, I'm sick to death of Mirna yelling at her cousin, "Come on Charla, this is a race, Charla, hurry up, Charla!" She  is  hurrying! Her legs are  half the length of yours, you dumbass!   Then there's Chip and Kim. Chip started out seeming like such a sweetheart, but turned into a snake in the second episode. He sabotaged Kami and Karli by jumping into their cab and refusing to get out until another cab arrived for his team. And now  he's  got the nerve to trash talk about  them , as though  they  were at fault. What a jackass.  And the pizza brothers, Marshall and Lance: at first look, I hoped they would be like the first season's Kevin and Drew, wise-cracking fun-lovers. Instead, they make offensive remarks about women drivers and the native people: "Useless foreigners!" Check your passport, chump:  you're  the foreigner, and your inability to communicate with the locals doesn't make  them  useless.  I just hate so many of these people. Which means the  Amazing Race 's casting directors have done their job again! Way to go!  COMICS: All the foofaraw over  Identity Crisis  has almost made me want to pick it up.  Almost . Because just when I think it sounds interesting or controversial enough for me to check out, I remember, Oh yeah, I couldn't care less about the Elongated Man. Killing off his wife is like killing off Dr. Marvin Monroe on  The Simpsons : nobody cared about him, nobody missed him, and after enough time had passed, he came back from the dead anyway. (Or as was said of Monty Burns: "His condition was upgraded to 'alive'.")  BOOKS: I actually will have a proper Books post to make later tonight, but it might be fairly late, since tonight is trivia night at the local sports bar. And I can't miss that. One minute before midnight is still keeping to the schedule!  TV AGAIN: Don't forget to tune into Denis Leary's firefighter comedy/drama  Rescue Me  on FX tonight. Even if you're not otherwise inclined to watch a Denis Leary show, just think of FX's record with original programming so far:  The Shield ,  Nip/Tuck , and, in my opinion, the best new show of 2003 (though sadly prematurely cancelled),  Lucky . I think that puts the chances for  Rescue Me  being a keeper pretty high, don't you?

      The three-month free preview of certain premium package channels on DirecTV just expired, which means I must once again survive without VH1 Classic. And I don't think I can.  Oh, sweet, sweet VH1 Classic. Get this: it's a music video channel -- that  plays music videos!  No, I'm  serious!  (Music videos, for those of you who are under 25, and therefore may never have seen one, are short films built around a particular song, often featuring the song's artists pretending to sing, and, as often as not, buxom women in various stages of undress. And, if you've only seen music videos on TRL, here's the kicker -- actual music videos last the ENTIRE LENGTH of a song, and are NOT OBSCURED by fawning text messages from sub-literate dipshits with computer access in their detention facilities, and are ENTIRELY FREE of screaming idiots in Times Square superimposed over the screen! Hard to believe, isn't it?)  MTV was lost to fans of music videos a long, long time ago. If you want "reality" programming showcasing the most repugnant alleged human beings on the planet, if you want pranks performed by a B-list celebrity on C-list dupes, if you want "news" "documentaries" about breast implants and other real-life issues, as long as they involve tits, if you want millionaires rubbing your nose in your non-millionaire life by showing you their personal bowling alleys and movie theaters and 87 pimped-out Rolls Royces, if you want awards shows that can't even get the major winners to show up to the ceremony, hosted by anyone who once appeared on  In Living Color  who isn't Jim Carrey, if you want  Gideon  and  Suchin Pak , for Christ's sake... then you want your MTV! If you want music videos, however -- or, even more specifically,  non hip-hop  music videos -- try checking in at about 3 AM, and maybe they'll throw a Creed bone your way.  The original VH1 is even worse. They rode a minor popularity wave for a while in the '90s, with non-video programming like  Behind the Music  and  Pop-Up Video , but that eventually petered out, and rather than going back to showing the Video Hits that the VH in their name stands for, they went all-nostalgia, all the time.  I Love the '80s !  I Love the '70s !  I Love the '80s Strikes Back !  I Love the '90s ! Even  Best Week Ever , which attempts to manufacture nostalgia for last Thursday. And if it's not nostalgia, then it's crappy, crappy,  crappy  movies, like  Grease 2  or -- and I still can't believe this one -- a heavily censored version of  Showgirls . Which, truth be told, is almost as unintentionally hilarious as the original -- the fact that someone actually digitally added bras to all the topless women cracks me up.  MTV2, for the longest time, I thought was the answer to my music video quest. They're all about the music, right? Well, for all I know, they might very well have been -- up until the point that I actually started  getting  it. Then it turned into a rerun-dumping ground for MTV, broken up by four-hour blocks of hip-hop. Okay, I get it already: the kids love the hip-hop. But I'm pretty sure  other  music is still being made, check me if I'm wrong. Would it kill you to play a video of one of  those  songs?  But then there's VH1 Classic. Sweet, sweet VH1 Classic. I would gladly trade the dozens of channels which are devoted to people decorating other people's homes (by force, if necessary) for VH1 Classic. I would give up all 28 variations on the Discovery Channel, I would sacrifice at least 10 of the 12 sports stations, I'd even give them back UPN, if they would only give me my one music video channel that only plays music videos.  And when I tell you they play  only  music videos, I'm not screwing around: they don't even have  commercials . At most, they break for a minute-long promo of something on VH1, or for a VJ to talk about Styx's current album, as though anyone gives a rat's ass about any Styx album more recent than 20 years ago. And then they get right back to playing a music video,  all  of it,  all the way through , no announcer speaking over the beginning or end or anything. And then after that, they play  another  one. And  another . Until you just want to weep for the beauty of it all.  The catch, of course, is that they're all older videos, at least five years old, I'd say, and usually more. The bonus is: no Creed! No Nelly! No Fred Durst! No Britney Spears! No Matchbox 20!  And again: I now have to learn to live without it. The free preview was wonderful, wonderful enough that I'd gladly pay for it -- if I only had to pay for that one channel. Instead, I would have to pay for a whole  buttload  of channels that I don't give a damn about, because DirecTV loves to screw you like that. "Why can't I pay a fraction of that price and get just the one channel?" I ask DirecTV. "Because sit down and shut up," they respond.  (This is why I don't get HBO. I can't just get the one HBO that has  The Sopranos . I have to also pay for HBO2, and HBO West, and HBO East, and HBO Reykjavik, Iceland, and HBO Family, and HBO Sports, and HBO Comedy, and HBO All Fraggle Rock All the Time, and HBO Dance For Us, Clown, DANCE!!!)  So, in summary: crap.  Also, I don't get Boomerang anymore, either, which is okay, because I didn't watch it nearly as much as I thought I would, anyway. I guess my craving for Huckleberry Hound and Top Cat and Wally Gator and Magilla Gorilla wasn't as strong as I thought it was. Oh well.

      I think the idea of a  Green Lantern  movie starring Jack Black is  great . So there.  I mean, come on. Some things are going to work well on the screen, and some things, no matter how hard you try, are going to look a little goofy. That's why I have no great faith in the upcoming  Fantastic Four  film -- no matter how expensive the special effects are, a man stretching his body like rubber is just going to look plain silly. Same with Green Lantern: he's got a magic ring that makes giant green boxing gloves. Sure, sure, they made GL pretty darn cool on the  Justice League  cartoon -- but still, it's a  cartoon . I just can't picture a serious  live action  Green Lantern looking anything but a little ridiculous. If it's going to be made, then  go  with the ridiculous,  embrace  it, cast Jack Black. And -- as has already been suggested by  urlLink Mike 's co-worker Chris: Ben Stiller as Sinestro. Or Vince Vaughn!

      I've never had a movie-going experience like  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11  .  I can't write an objective and analytical review of this film. I'm not hyper-informed enough to pick out the alleged inaccuracies of the film, nor to counter the inaccuracies of those who listed Michael Moore's inaccuracies in the first place. I don't doubt that some of the film has been exaggerated, taken out of context, skewed to support Moore's beliefs. And those beliefs mirror mine, that Bush and his administration are deeply corrupt, deceitful, and dangerous, so I'm more inclined to take Moore's side in any case.  All I can tell you is how I felt, and what I'm still feeling, 24 hours later.  It was an incredibly emotional two hours. I cycled through any number of powerful feelings -- I was furious, I was appalled, I was horrified, I was laughing out loud, I was ashamed, I was sickened, I was guilt-ridden, I was deeply mournful. I was  devastated . I literally had tears running down my cheeks at one point: when, in the film's centerpiece, Moore talks to a woman from his hometown of Flint, Michigan, a conservative military booster who lost a son in Iraq -- her world has been destroyed, and she doesn't even know why -- it's overwhelming, just overwhelming. Thinking about it even now, I feel my throat tightening and my eyes watering. You can't watch that segment and be unmoved. You simply can't. Unless you're a robot. In which case you totally deserve to have your ass kicked by Will Smith.  She reads her son's last letter home, and he asks her what he's doing there, why Bush has sent him and so many others to Iraq, and she doesn't have any more idea than he did. But Moore has an idea or two, most of them involving the vast amounts of money the Saudis invest in America. Fifteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers were Saudis, the Bin Laden family are Saudis, but Bush can't afford to alienate a country with that much money -- especially when they're spending it on companies closely related to him and his family. So instead he picks a scapegoat, trumps up some WMD charges, and off to war we go.  That's what Moore believes to be true, and that's what he sets out to prove. Whether he succeeds or not is up to the individual filmgoer.  But there are things in this film that can not be countered or spun. The human cost, on both sides of this war, is immeasurable. Try to hate the Iraqis, when you see a pickup truck full of dead Iraqi children. Try blaming the U.S. soldiers, when you see a double amputee describe the crushing pain he still feels in his missing hands, or a mother's grief at losing her firstborn son.  I certainly wasn't alone in the audience. When I got emotional, I could hear others around me in the same state: gasping, sniffling, snorting at Bush's clownish pandering to the rich while the poor on both sides were dying. There were even some who, like me, sat through the end credits to hear all of Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World," which was a decompression period, a cathartic release, at the end of such a roller coaster of emotions. There was little else I could think of for  hours  after I left the theater. This is a film that stays with you.  I couldn't recommend this film more highly.  Everyone  needs to see it. Even those who hate Michael Moore, who support the president without question (as Britney Spears is shown professing in one hilarious interview segment) -- if only to come out of it saying, "I still support the war, but now I'm fully aware of the human cost involved."

      According to  urlLink this story on Yahoo ,  urlLink Bryan Singer  has now been signed to direct the upcoming  Superman  film.  If this holds to be true, it throws a bit of a monkey wrench in Singer's plans to direct a remake of  Logan's Run  (really?), followed by the third  X-Men  movie. I can live with that, though, knowing someone is in charge of  Superman  that knows how to direct an action scene without splitting it into 87,000 micro-cuts, knows how to direct  actors  and get actual, you know  performances  out of them, and, hell, just plain knows how to direct a good film.  I mean, an action director that's also a  good  director. What a concept. How many of those are around these days? Let's see: Singer, Ang Lee... uh... hmm. Let me get back to you.

      Occasionally, a piece of familiar music takes on entirely new significance due to the way it is used in a film or TV show. Quentin Tarantino is a master of this kind of recontextualizing (if I may use a $10 word) of music, the prime example probably being the innocuous lite FM hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" playing during the torture scene in  Reservoir Dogs . Here are a couple of other examples in my life:  An obvious and corny one is Foo Fighters' "Next Year," which was used as the theme song on the TV show  urlLink  Ed  . It was more a coincidence of timing than anything else which changed my perception of that song -- just as the title character returns to his hometown after a long absence, so did I return to my hometown around the time of the show's debut. I didn't buy a bowling alley or anything, but still, it was hard to listen to the line, "I'll be coming home next year," and not feel that the song was speaking to me in a new and personal way.  Blind Faith's " urlLink Can't Find My Way Home " (which I've  urlLink mentioned before ) was always a sweet and enjoyable tune to me. Steve Winwood's soulful voice over Eric Clapton's haunting acoustic guitar... good stuff. In college, it became a personal favorite, especially after one inebriated evening when a friend and I decided to do some exploration of the Berkeley Hills and literally couldn't find our way home. I kept wondering how long it would take the search crews to recover our rotting corpses, and thinking of that line from the chorus, "I'm wasted and I can't find my way home."  Then I watched the movie  urlLink  Fandango  , and the song took on a new meaning for me. The film ends with the loss and heartbreak that come with growing up: A close knit group of college friends, at the conclusion of their last adventure together after graduation, have all gone their separate ways, probably never to see each other again. And Kevin Costner, still pining for the love of his life, has just swallowed his emotions and served as the best man in her wedding to his best friend. After everyone has gone, and he stands alone in the dark on a desert hill, the credits roll, and "Can't Find My Way Home" plays. And now, I can't hear that song without experiencing similar feelings of isolation and heartache. All because of a movie.  A song which became much more enjoyable to me after its onscreen use is Kid Rock's "Bawitaba." No, I'm not kidding. And if you've ever seen the first episode of  urlLink  The Shield  , you know what I'm talking about. (If you haven't, go rent the DVD. Now.) I liked the song just fine to begin with, but it becomes a brutal, powerful anthem when coupled with  The Shield 's compelling anti-hero, Vic Mackey. In the pilot episode, we've seen that Mackey and his cadre of corrupt cops have drawn the suspicions of precinct Captain Aceveda, who arranges for a new cop, an informant, to join Mackey's crew. The crew's big assignment is to take down a major drug dealer. In the final four minutes of the episode, Mackey's crew carries out their raid on the dealer's house in near silence -- with "Bawitaba" blaring on the soundtrack. Mackey guns down the drug dealer, and then -- in the very last seconds of the song, and of the episode, Mackey pulls the gun from the drug dealer's dead hand and shoots the informant cop right between the eyes. Said up jump the boogie.  God  damn  if that wasn't the most shocking, powerful moment in all of television that year. And ever since watching it, I can't help but invest "Bawitaba" with equal power.  And earlier today, I finally watched  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11  , which closes with Neil Young's soaring, scathing indictment of the first Bush's presidency, "Rockin' in the Free World." Didn't take much to repurpose it for Bush, the sequel:   There's a warning sign on the road ahead There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off dead Don't feel like Satan but I am to them So I try to forget it any way I can Keep on rockin' in the free world   I instantly knew I would never hear that song the same way again. Nor, I think, will anyone who sees that film.

      Everyone in the comics "blogosphere," for lack of a non-idiotic term, is chiming in with their incredibly detailed deconstructions of Dan Clowes' new issue of  Eightball , as though it were a newly discovered James Joyce novel. So, never one to shy away from a challenge, here is my own meticulous examination:  I liked it fine. It made me a little sad. Louie was kind of a dick.

      A few of my takes on the 2004 Emmy nominations:  --Biggest oversight is Michael Chiklis for  The Shield . I think it's the best show on television, and he's the best thing about it. I mean, how unfair is it that he gets dropped from last year's list, but Kiefer Sutherland remains? This is just an example of how, when something finally breaks into the awareness of the Emmy voters, it takes a miracle to dislodge it -- apparently, none of them realized  24  became a parody of itself this year (as if it weren't already one last year), just as none of them are willing to admit  The West Wing 's best days are  way  behind it now. But  The Shield , despite Chiklis's surprising Emmy win in its first season, has never fully penetrated the Emmy voters' groupthink, probably because it's on a non-broadcast network that  isn't  HBO.  --Also, I'm grateful to see  Arrested Development  got the attention it deserved, but disappointed that  Scrubs  continues to be slighted (despite best editing and best writing noms this year). No John C. McGinley as supporting actor? That's just  wrong .  -- Sex and the City 's popularity continues to baffle me, but at least this is the last year it can hog all those nominations. And good riddance to it. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: HBO actually managed to create a show so bad that  no amount  of gratuitous nudity could make me watch it. And don't tell me it's because it's meant for women, and I just don't understand it. I understand a piece of crap when I see it. All those women read  Bridges of Madison County , too -- doesn't mean it wasn't still a big steaming pile of horse crap.  --Matt LeBlanc: enjoy your acting nomination. It'll be your last.  -- Joan of Arcadia 's entry in the best drama category is a bit of a surprise, but maybe it shouldn't be. Emmy voters love that God fella! And Amber Tamblyn's nomination for best actress is amazing (but well-deserved), considering her -- and the show's -- youth.  --On the other hand -- Mariska Hargitay, for  Law & Order: One of Those Damn Spin-Offs ?  Really?  Are there  that  few deserving actresses working in TV these days?  --I wish I still had HBO. Sounds like I'm missing a lot of good stuff. I hope  Deadwood  comes out on DVD soon.  --Emmy voters, you've given an award to all four  Will & Grace  actors. You can stop nominating them now. Actually, you should've stopped before Debra Messing won. What was  that  all about??  --Even sadder than a nomination coming after a show's cancellation -- as with Bonnie Hunt (whom I love), or  Futurama  -- is a nomination coming after an  actor's  cancellation. Which is my morbid way of saying, I loved John Ritter and all, but giving him an Emmy nomination he didn't deserve isn't going to make anyone feel any better.  --I find a bitter kind of satisfaction in the fact that after all the hoopla over their respective finales, neither  Friends  nor  Frasier  were nominated as best comedy. If only I could say the same about that damn  Sex and the City .

      Okay, let's try this again.    Superman/Batman : As I said before, this story needs to end. Batman and Superman's dueling captions have been saying the  exact same thing  for, what four issues now?    BATMAN: I don't trust anyone because mommy didn't hold me enough. Superman's a chump and a doofus.  SUPERMAN: Batman's got a stick up his ass. I'm totally right to put all my trust in someone I've known for three days. (I may be paraphrasing a little.) And I'm getting a little tired of Michael Turner's art. It's gorgeous in places, but everyone is starting to look like a Kate Moss-type, heroin-chic cover model.    She-Hulk : Don't care for the new artist. I don't know if this is a permanent art change, but I hope not. I mean, She-Hulk is actually wearing that purple and white skintight uniform on the cover  inside  the comic now. That's not an improvement. The last artist made some weird alterations to fairly well-established character designs, like the Thing and Spider-Man, but they were pleasantly eye-catching changes. The new art is more standard action fare. I hope this title doesn't start playing down to generic superhero expectations, rather than remaining the unique genre-busting book I became a fan of. (Although I have to admit, I got a kick out of seeing Nova knocked across town.)    Captain America : I'm a fan of Robert Kirkman's  Invincible  and  The Walking Dead , but his writing debut here did not impress me at  all . The characters speak in awkward phrases and corny cliches; Captain America is portrayed as a lunkhead on cruise control. The best part was the peek at Hydra's break room, but that was it for originality. Disappointing.    Fables  Also disappointing. After eight issues of the Wooden Soldiers, all the conflicts are resolved off-page. Bigby wipes out the Wooden Soldiers, but we only get to see the Gingerbread House Witch's description of it. And the Witch vs. Red Riding Hood/Baba Yaga battle is only shown in one panel, reflected in King Cole's eye.  Lame . After eight issues of build-up, we deserve to  witness  those resolutions. Also, Snow White's running and embracing Bigby was way out of character. First issue of  Fables  that let me down. At least there's a new story next issue.    Punisher : Which is more than I can say for this title. I've already complained about this tedious storyline before. All I'll add now is, I wish every goddam story in every goddam Marvel Comic weren't Constitutionally required to be six goddam issues.    Scurvy Dogs : Hilarious as always. Everyone should get this book. This issue, Blackbeard's crew gets swept up in a media frenzy orchestrated by  urlLink  Buck Rogers in the 25th Century  's Dr. Theopolis -- remember him? He was the talking disc Twiki carried around his neck. Twiki dumped him, and now a gasoline-drinking Rod Stewart carries him instead. This book is sheer comic genius.    Street Angel : As is this one. I picked up the second issue because of a mention of it in  urlLink John Jakala's Grotesque Anatomy  (oddly enough, in a post with a negative review of the upcoming third issue). I really want to go into this issue in more detail, because its insane comedic brilliance deserves proper attention, but I will mention it involves a Mexican wresting mask-wearing Incan sun god, Spanish Conquistador Cortez, who strangely enough has a pegleg and talks like a movie pirate, a bunch of ninjas who ride fire engines into battle (so much for that vaunted ninja stealth!), Cosmick, the world's first Irish astronaut (Cos mick , get it?), and Jesse, a teenage girl, master of the martial arts, and the world's greatest homeless skateboarder, who fights against "ninjas, drugs, nepotism, and pre-algebra as Street Angel." I  loved  this book.

      I just added the HaloScan comment system to the blog, because I hated Blogger's comment system. Hopefully, I did it right.  My apologies to everyone who commented under the old system. Probably there is a way to have kept those comments from disappearing, but I'm neither computer savvy enough nor patient enough to figure it out. Maybe I'll cut and paste them from gmail, where all the comment updates have been saved.

      I just spent over an hour on a comics post that just got obliterated because Blogger's "improvements" to their post creation form are buggy as hell and suck copious amounts of ass. I even right-clicked and saved the text as a precaution: the crash still erased it all. Blogger is a severely shitty site.  GOD DAMN IT!!!  I'm so furious I can't even attempt to recreate the post now. I'm done. Here, here's my frickin' update:  Street Angel  is awesome,  The Punisher  and  Superman/Batman  need to finish their tedious current storylines right  now , the finish of the Wooden Soldiers story in  Fables  was surprisingly disappointing, Chaykin's  Bite Club  is just okay, while his  Challengers of the Unknown  is excellent, visually exciting with a compelling story, though the characters are all underdeveloped so far, and  The Pulse  was typical Bendis, meaning the story is padded beyond belief, but I still liked it, the dialogue, and the characters.  And I haven't yet read  She-Hulk , Robert Kirkman's debut on  Captain America ,  Scurvy Dogs , and  Eightball .  God damn lousy Blogger.

      A month old, but new to me, found via  urlLink Distorting the Medium :   urlLink George A. Romero has suddenly gotten financing in order for not one, but TWO horror movies.  One is  urlLink  Diamond Dead  , some rock 'n' roll horror comedy type thing that, eh. Big whoop.  But the other is the long, long, LONG overdue fourth entry in Romero's legendary zombie series, which is now being called  Land of the Dead ! (Previously known as  Dead Reckoning , and before that,  Dusk of the Dead , which is my favorite title of the three, but what are you gonna do.) It could actually be in production as early as October. For real this time! (I hope.)  I guess the recent hit remake of Part 2 of Romero's  Dead  trilogy (soon to be tetralogy -- yes, that's the  urlLink proper word ),  Dawn of the Dead , got some geniuses to thinking -- hey, what if we gave some money to the guy who did the original? What a concept.  Oh, man oh man, do I love me some zombies. I dig all kinds of horror movies in general, especially the  Friday the 13th  series (Jason kicks ASS), but I still think  Day of the Dead  may be the best I've ever seen. Talk about gruesome! And zombies are the perfect villain. They don't have a backstory, or any hammy dramatic speeches. They don't justify their actions, and they don't waste time explaining their plans to the hero. There's no reasoning or bargaining with them. They're not even evil, really. They don't care about taking over the world. All they want is to eat your brains. Eat 'em right the fuck up! I admire that kind of straightforwardness in a monster.

      I think I'm going to have to rejigger my posting schedule, because I just don't read fast enough anymore to have a new book to write about every week.  This week, I could write about  Captains Outrageous , which I'm almost finished with, but since  urlLink I already wrote about it , that would be a tad redundant. And repetitive. And it would say the same thing over again. And it would be redundant, too.  Or I could write about the Steve Martin book I picked up at the library this week,  urlLink  The Pleasure of My Company  , but I haven't read it yet, despite the fact it's only, like, 12 pages long. Seriously, it's short. But I can barely read six comic books in one day anymore, let alone a whole novel (like I used to).  So I can talk a little about Martin's  last  novel,  urlLink  Shopgirl  , which I  have  read, and then I'll talk about the changes I'm thinking of making to this site.  Mostly what I remember about  Shopgirl  was how funny it  wasn't . There were more than a few humorous lines and scenes, but the overall feeling I got from it was one of melancholy. Love didn't seem to work for any of its characters, and frankly, I felt a little concerned for Steve Martin. After all, Anne Heche dumped him for Ellen Degeneres. That's enough to destroy  any  man's hopes for true love.  (Tangent: I wonder if he and Ellen have ever talked about Anne. I mean, he drove her to the other team, and she drove her right back. There can't be an awful lot of people in the world who have shared an experience like that. Maybe they have meetings with Lou Diamond Phillips, whom Julie Cypher left to be with Melissa Etheridge.)  Also, I was shocked at the sexual explicitness of  Shopgirl . I've grown to think of Steve Martin as an almost asexual character, like Gilligan. As disturbing as it would be to picture Gilligan having a three-way with Ginger and Mary Ann, so was it disturbing to read sex scenes written by Steve Martin. As disturbing as it was to watch him  participate  in a sex scene with Helena Bonham-Carter in  urlLink  Novocaine  .  Even more disturbing: my mother wanted to borrow the book when I was done. She was thinking, "Oh, Steve Martin, he's a silly fella." Meanwhile, he had written an unexpectedly dark and sexually frank book. I don't know about  your  relationship with your mother, but  I  was not going to be responsible for giving her that book. She kept asking if I had finished it, and I kept saying, "Nope, not yet!" even though I had finished it in a day and a half. I stalled long enough that I had to return the book to the library. "Sorry, I guess you'll have to check it out yourself!" I don't know if she ever did. I kind of hope not.    So, what to do with my blog if Wednesdays are no longer book days? It's a little early in my blog's existence to have an identity crisis, yet here we are. I think I may either open the "books" entry to comic book trade paperbacks as well, of which I have far too many for my own good. Or turn it into a grab bag kind of day -- books one week, music or art or whatever the next. Already I post a variety of different items on different days, but I wanted this blog to have an agenda of at least one lengthy post on one particular predetermined aspect of pop culture every weekday. I think I'm going to have to concede defeat on the book posts for the immediate future.  I'll sleep on it tonight. More contemplation tomorrow.

      Wolverine's short, right? I mean, that's his deal. He's small but ferocious, like the animal.      So how come in the future he's taller than everybody else?  Forgive me if I'm a year behind the curve here, but I just read the TPB, and I have to wonder why Silvestri draws Wolverine so damn tall. He's Clint Eastwood when he should be Tom Cruise. Maybe he's still growing. But then he'd outgrow his adamantium skeleton, wouldn't he?  Is it just me on this?  [ EDIT:  Not only is it not just me, but it's not just Silvestri. Today at the comic shop  urlLink Dorian  let me know it's been Marvel's policy for a while now to depict Wolvie as tall and sleek, as opposed to short and stocky. I guess I don't read comics with Wolverine in them much. Except when Garth Ennis is having the Punisher blow his face off.]

      Found via  urlLink gutterninja , who found it elsewhere:   urlLink Hulk's Diary.   It almost causes me physical pain that I didn't think of this first.  Sample:   Hulk saw movie about bug-man and it was good but needed more smashing.  AND HULK DID NOT GET SNIFFLY DURING ROMANTIC SCENES SO IF YOU HEAR IRON MAN OR THOR TALKING ABOUT IT THEY ARE LIARS.

      First of all, USA network, get over yourself.  urlLink  The 4400   is hardly UNPRECEDENTED, as you keep insisting (about 8,000 times during Sunday's two-hour premiere, by my count). In the immortal words of  urlLink Inigo Montoya , "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." It's a  mini-series . We've seen those before. Airing one episode a week and calling it a "limited series" doesn't change what it is -- nor is  that  little semantics game UNPRECEDENTED. ABC, for one, did the same thing with  urlLink  Kingdom Hospital  . A mini-series, by any other name...  Despite USA's best efforts to irritate the crap out of me, I still enjoyed this first episode. It's a great premise -- all those people who have been abducted by aliens being returned to Earth at the same time. The execution, though, is a bit uneven. There are a ton of characters (not 4400, fortunately, but still a lot), and not all of them are written or acted equally well. Michael Moriarty as returnee Orson Bailey is certainly a stand-out, from both the writing and acting perspectives. (But Moriarty himself worries me a little -- is he really that feeble, or is it just uncanny acting? I kept fearing he would fall over and shatter.) Also interesting is Mahershalalhashbaz (-expialidocious) Ali as Korean Conflict soldier Richard Tyler, who runs into Lily, the  granddaughter  of the love of his life, among the 4400. And falls in love with  her . (Well, not yet, but I'm assuming.) Lily also has a good storyline: she's only been gone 11 years, but her husband has written her completely out of her then-infant, now 12-year-old, daughter's life; her daughter doesn't even realize her stepmother isn't her real mother. And daddy is doing everything to keep it that way. Plus, Lily's pregnant. Man, when it rains it pours.  The returnees aren't all great characters, and their reintegration into the modern world is rife with contrived conflict and melodrama (especially the high school student, who gets picked on by bullies, and wants to steal his brother's hot girlfriend), but that's nothing compared to the two Homeland Security agents heading the case. Do they butt heads at first, but quickly develop a grudging admiration for one another? You bet your ass they do! And that's about the least lazily-written and cliche-ridden element to these two. Joel Gretsch as Agent Tom Baldwin has a certain factory-produced, generic charm, but Jacqueline McKenzie as Agent Dana Scu... I mean, Diana Skouris, doesn't even have a comatose son or divorce proceedings to contend with, as Baldwin does, so she's a cipher. Pretty, but there's zip to make her interesting, other than arguing with and sometimes saving her partner.  And yet I'll still stick with this series. Why? Well, I'm already a third of the way through its six hours -- but that's not it. Despite myself, I've become interested in the story. Where did these people go? Why were they returned? What are these powers some of them have begun to exhibit? Will the aliens come back for them? This first episode had me hooked with the story, and overlooking most of its flaws.  It's not brilliant sci-fi, but it's above average. I'm actually looking forward to the next episode, and finding out what happens to that creepy little girl who can now see the future, or even that high school student, who brought a dead bird back to life. And for a summer series that's... why, it's almost UNPRECEDENTED.

      I caught a sneak preview of  urlLink  The Bourne Supremacy   last Tuesday night. Since it's not due to be released until July 23, I'll consider this entire review a spoiler, and hide it accordingly.  (Actually, I wasn't even going to post this review, since it kind of rambles, and honestly, my heart's not really in it, but, hell, it's Movies day, and I gots nothin else.)   Overall, I was disappointed. The acting was fine, the story was interesting, and the characters generally did smart, logical things. Where it failed totally was during what  should  be the highlights of a spy thriller -- the action scenes.  I'm assuming that the director previously worked in videos and commercials -- and that probably tells you all you need to know about his style of directing. The camera just would not sit still for one damn second. Always zipping and whirling and jittering and jumping, 8,000 cuts per second, spinning and whooshing right past what you wanted to look at. It got to the point where I wanted to yell at the screen, "Sit still and show me what the hell is going on!!" The fight scenes may or may not have been well choreographed, the chases may or may not have been cleverly staged -- I don't know, because I couldn't see a god damn thing that was happening. The camera would only show a millisecond of a fist moving, or an extreme close-up of a head jerking back, or  some  damn thing or another blurring past my field of vision. (During the car chase, for example, I could never tell which car was where, but I remember about a dozen good shots of the gas pedal, because  that's  important.) I actually got  angry  at the direction, and a little bit queasy. I'm not an idiot, who can be distracted by shiny, flashy objects. I just want an action scene presented in a straightforward, easily comprehensible, and entertaining manner. Is that too much to ask for? These days, probably yes.  It's a shame, because so much of the rest of the film is well done. Brian Cox -- and I'll warn you again, these are all spoilers -- Brian Cox returns from the first film, reprising his role as the man who created the Treadstone program responsible for Bourne's training; he is revealed here as the traitor everyone is looking for -- which, really, is obvious fairly early on. I mean, he's the only major character in the government who is insisting that Bourne be killed; he runs interference on every move Joan Allen, as head of the search for Bourne, puts forward. But Cox is a great actor, and he plays the villain well. Joan Allen is also a great performer, but she doesn't have an awful lot to do here; it's like Judi Dench's role in the Bond movies, overkill for an underwritten role. But she's a solid presence, anchoring the team hunting down Bourne. Franka Potente also returns from the first film; she's sweet during her limited screentime, but sadly, she doesn't last very long. Julia Stiles also returns, and again, it's overkill for her small role. She's excellent in her few scenes, especially the one in which Bourne interrogates her, but she could be starring in her own films, rather than taking small parts in the Bourne series. Makes you wonder why she's even here. Chris Cooper, who was killed in the first film, even has a cameo in a flashback, which was a nice touch.  And Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is fine as well. His character doesn't get much development here; apparently, he's sworn not to kill again, at the request of his now dead love, Franka, but his decision to leave certain of his enemies still breathing after he's gone to such lengths to hunt them down is a little mystifying (especially the man who put the bullet in Franka's head -- and especially considering there's at least one other person he  does  kill). A lot of his backstory is left out of the film; when Joan Allen reveals Bourne's real name at the end of the film, I realized that this film doesn't even explain that Bourne  doesn't  know his real name. And when Julia Stiles lists the side effects some of the Treadstone agents have suffered, Allen asks, "Amnesia?" And Stiles replies, "Before Bourne? No." If the viewer hasn't seen the first film, he might assume the project  caused  Jason's amnesia, rather than a blow to the head.  But Bourne for the most part plays it smart -- the film and the character both. Bourne gets captured in an airport -- but only because he  wants  to be caught, to identify the people who are chasing him. To buy some time after a fight, he pulls a gas hose out of the wall, then stuffs a magazine in a toaster and pushes the lever -- a unique time bomb. He arranges a meeting with Julia Stiles in the middle of a protest march, so he can grab her and get lost in the crowd. And a scene at the end, where he confronts the daughter of a couple he killed in his pre-amnesia career, and breaks the news to her that it was  not  a murder-suicide, as he had staged it to look, that her mother did  not  pull the trigger -- it's a tough, compelling, dark, smart scene, well-played by Damon. You almost hope the daughter will kill him in revenge. I think it's bold to have a scene like that so near the end of the film; he's attempting to redeem himself with this confession, but he only makes himself look more horrible to the audience. It trusts the audience to stay with the character, and it works. Somehow, though, I get the suspicion that scene will be changed after these test screenings; might be I'm the only one in favor of such a dark scene.   Would I recommend  The Bourne Supremacy ? There are things I enjoyed, but in the end, in its present form: no, I would not. Maybe on DVD, or on HBO, but definitely not for full price in the theaters. I just think the action scenes, which are vital to a film like this, are thoroughly inept in their execution, and completely unenjoyable, and I don't think there's any way they can be fixed without re-editing them from scratch. Which won't happen.

      Good news and bad news about the upcoming  Superman  movie.  Good news first: according to  urlLink this item  on IMDb, talentless hack extraordinaire  urlLink McG , who inflicted the two  Charlie's Angels  films on an unsuspecting public, has backed out of (been fired from?) the project, citing the production's move to Australia (Australia??) as a reason.  Bad news: IMDb now lists  urlLink ADHD  poster child and reigning King of the Hacks  urlLink Michael Bay  as the director. This is the man responsible for  Bad Boys II , people. He is pure evil. Michael Bay is, in fact, the devil, and anyone who suggests otherwise is in all likelihood a minion of hell, and should be dealt with accordingly.  Also, why does everyone keep calling this a sequel? It's starting over from scratch, not picking up where  urlLink this damn thing  left off.

      This is a recurring feature that I just made up. TV shows that never got the chance they should've had, and fell under the axe before their time. Up first:  urlLink  Cupid  . Also, this entry has more IMDb links than you can shake a stick at. Well, it would have to be a very large stick, anyway.   Cupid , which aired 14 episodes from 1998-99, was the story of Trevor Hale ( urlLink Jeremy Piven ), a man who may be, or may only  think  he is, Cupid, the god of love, and Dr. Claire Allen ( urlLink Paula Marshall , whose streak of cancelled TV shows rivals the king of series-killers,  urlLink Ted McGinley ), the psychologist who takes on his case. Trevor/Cupid claims he has been exiled from Mt. Olympus, and the only way to win back the favor of Zeus and return home is to unite 100 couples in true love --  without  the help of his legendary bow and arrows.  While I loved the show at the time, the "100 couples" thing struck me as hubris -- 100 episodes being the magic number to achieve syndication. As it turns out, he fell about 85 couples/episodes short. (Funnily enough, another show that debuted at the same time,  urlLink  Brimstone  , had a similarly overreaching premise --  urlLink Peter Horton , a cop sent to hell, was returned to earth in order to recapture 113 escaped damned souls. In its defense, it did feature  urlLink John Glover  as the Devil, which is the best Satanic casting since  urlLink Gary Cole  in the also cancelled too soon  urlLink  American Gothic  . Hmm, I think I've gotten off track here.)  The charm of the show was almost entirely dependent on Piven's vast comedic charisma, which he utilized in crashing Marshall's group therapy sessions, picking out the likeliest prospects and finding them romance. He was all constant motion and unquenchable positivity, machine-gunning quips and come-ons faster than  urlLink Bruce Willis  in  urlLink  Moonlighting  . Marshall did her best to keep up, and I'll admit, her success was closer to  urlLink Cybill Shepherd 's than  urlLink Pam Dawber 's. She's very attractive, and an able comedic actress, and she gave  almost  as good as she got. But the show was all about Piven, and its success or failure depended on him. I thought he succeeded by a mile. America disagreed. Stupid America.  The show also had one of the best theme songs ever: "Human," by the Pretenders (listening to which is what got me started on this entry). The show came out almost a  year  before the  urlLink album  on which the song was featured, which makes me think the song was written specifically for the show, as do the lyrics:   If love was a war, it's you who has won While I was confessing it, you held your tongue Now the damage is done Well, there's blood in these veins And I cry when in pain I'm only human on the inside And if looks could deceive Make it hard to believe I'm only human on the inside   The true shame of  Cupid 's cancellation is that I think this was Piven's best opportunity to become a real star. He's a highly visible actor, but generally relegated to small roles either opposite real-life best friend  urlLink John Cusack , or as a raging douchebag, as in  urlLink  Old School  , or both, as in  urlLink  One Crazy Summer  . He can and should be carrying romantic comedies as the lead, as he did in  Cupid , and if there's any justice in Hollywood (which there isn't), he will someday. In something better than  urlLink  PCU  , hopefully.

       urlLink  Three Strikes   is the story of Rey Quintana, a kid on the run, and Noah Conway, the bounty hunter (Conway: "The term is bail enforcement officer. Asshole.") on his trail. The title of the story -- a five issue mini-series collected in trade paperback -- is  why  Rey is on the run. California's controversial -- and in my mind, deeply flawed -- "three strikes" law means that Rey, arrested for shoplifting a pair of earrings -- which makes it his third, though minor and non-violent, offense -- will face  twenty-two  years in jail on conviction.  Rey only gets into more trouble on the run, and the central question becomes, whose fault is it? Is the DA right, is Rey naturally inclined towards crime? Is the public defender right when she says it's Conway's pursuit of Quintana that forced him into additional crimes? Is it the bad influence of Rey's friend Billy, is it just a series of bad choices and bad luck, is the "three strikes" law itself to blame? (Personally, I blame society, but then, I always do.)  The two main characters are both sympathetic and both troubled. Conway is a cop who retired early to spend time with his wife and daughter -- but his wife divorced him, and his daughter hates him. Now he's tracking Quintana while simultaneously taking care of his daughter, trying to make up for being such a bad parent. And at first, he doesn't care about Quintana's situation, it's just another job, but slowly he begins to feel a responsibility for Rey -- he wants to stop him before he makes any more mistakes. And Rey  is  a good kid, in a very bad situation, but as the mistakes begin to pile up, he finds it easier and easier to justify the next one.  DeFilippis and Weir, a husband-and-wife writing team, have created a compelling and thoughtful work, and I think I'll be checking out some of their other projects on next week's visit to the comic shop -- there's  Skinwalkers , which I've  urlLink mentioned briefly before ,  Once in a Blue Moon ,  Maria's Wedding , and  The Tomb , all of which are out in TPB, and they also had a run on  New Mutants , which I almost but not quite want to check out (the X-characters don't interest me much, especially the second- and third-tier ones). And the black and white artwork by Brian Hurtt (same artist as on  Skinwalkers ) is great -- not flashy, but it presents the dark, gritty story very well, with distinctive and expressive characters (my only quibble is with his women characters, specifically the white women: the public defender, Conway's ex-wife, and his daughter all look like the same blonde woman).  Thanks again to  urlLink Dorian  for the good recommendation. I don't care what everyone says, you've got good taste!

      I goofed yesterday. Instead of posting my weekly comics entry, I saved it as a draft. So the update did not appear. Crap. Technically, I did update yesterday, keeping my daily post streak alive; it's just none of you could  see  the update. Okay, technically, I screwed the pooch. But it's up now.  MOVIES: Just re-watched  urlLink  Gremlins 2: The New Batch   on DVD. It really is a very funny, satirical film. My favorite parts are when it directly satirizes the original  Gremlins , as when Leonard Maltin gives that film a bad review, and is savaged by gremlins. Or, even better, when Phoebe Cates, spoofing her "Why I hate Christmas" speech from the first film, suddenly goes into a silly "Why I hate Lincoln's Birthday" rant, while boyfriend Zach Galligan rolls his eyes behind her. Best of all, you gotta love Tony Randall as the "Brain" Gremlin. Oh, and Christopher Lee (as "Dr. Catheter") carrying a pod from  Invasion of the Body Snatchers . And also... oh, lots of stuff. Really, it's good.      COMICS: This week's Comic Shop News has a big article on the impending return of  Grimjack , my favorite comic book ever. After more than ten years of legal battles over the rights to the character, which were tied up when original publisher First Comics went bankrupt, the rights have finally returned to co-creators John Ostrander (writer) and Timothy Truman (artist). A six issue mini-series is scheduled to debut in early 2005, returning to the first incarnation (it's a long story) of Grimjack, John Gaunt, along with reprints of the original series, and if they do well, there's a possibility of Grimjack returning in a monthly book. Nothing would make me happier. Well, okay,  many  things would make me happier, starting with  urlLink Lauren Graham  in a French maid's outfit on top of a pile of hundred dollar bills... but nothing  within the realm of possibility  would make me happier.

      I was going to do my comics post a day late this week, since they were released a day late due to the Monday holiday, but looks like I can squeeze this post in tonight. Four new comics this week; may contain spoilers for readers slower than I am.   Supreme Power : I've been borderline on this series for a while. The concept itself is, of course, a revision of an old rip-off of the JLA, and I've seen plenty enough of those as it is. And the story has been moving  verrrry  slowly. Almost  Bendis  slow. But things happened in this one that I liked: Mark Milton learns his secret origin! Several different versions, in fact, from the very unreliable and possibly insane Zarda (the Wonder Woman rip-off). Mark appears to doubt her assertion that she's from the same place he is -- but she's hot, naked (this comic has more boobs than Cinemax After Dark), and he's probably still a virgin, so looks like he's gonna let that slide for now. The dog. Also, the Batman and Flash rip-offs team up to find that there's yet another superpowered being out there -- a serial killing one. It was a good issue, so guess I'll be sticking around a while longer.   Powers : Speaking of Bendis... First issue of the reboot, now at new Marvel imprint Icon, rather than Image. Only thing that's changed is the little box on the cover; inside is still the same old badass  Powers . Starts off with quite a shocker: Kutter, who could probably be described as the #3 character, gets killed in the traditional sudden and graphic  Powers  style. Walker and Deena are back together as partners, which is nice to see. Bendis' dialogue is as long-winded but hilarious as ever ("How'd he die?" "Dunno." "Don't be so technical."), but, unlike certain Bendis projects, stuff  happens  here. He basically reinvents the entire world within the comic in this one issue, plus has time for a nifty action scene, plenty of great dialogue and character moments, and a great reveal on the final page. Bendis' best series (out of, like, 87), and one of my top ten, if not top five.   Fantastic Four : Another of my favorites. I had never been much of an FF fan, outside of the Stan Lee originals, so I'm not really familiar with the "Frightful Four." But I get the feeling Mark Waid portrays them about as well as they can be -- after all, the Wizard, the Trapster, Salamandra, and Hydro are C-list villains at best. The way in which they defeat the FF is believable, and the reason why the Wizard doesn't kill them outright, which is always a stupid, Bond villain thing to do -- the reason he doesn't is kind of plausible, the way the character is portrayed. Waid's writing is funny and sharp, and I love the art. The only Marvels I buy are for the writers -- Marvel has great characters, but the writers have to know how to use them -- and Waid is now up there in that category with Peter David, Garth Ennis, J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Bendis, and a select few others.   Y: The Last Man :  Another  of my faves. Only bought four comics this week, and three of them are in my personal top ten. This one is in my top three, actually. Best thing about this issue: the slam against those dopey, non-"born again" bashing, crappily written, inexplicably popular religious screeds disguised as fantasy, the  Left Behind  series. Yorick is a great character, and he goes through a great deal of development this issue, dealing with his remorse over the woman he had to kill the previous issue, and allowing himself to finally let go of -- or at least, forget for a little while -- his girlfriend half a world away, whom he may never see again. It's just a great book.  I also picked up a  Hopeless Savages  collection (a funny book about a punk rock family), and the  Three Strikes  TPB (gritty crime drama), because of good Free Comic Book Day issues. The  Three Strikes  book I got because it's by the same team behind the  Skinwalkers  series, one issue of which I picked up as a leftover from last year's FCBD (come to think of it, the  Hopeless Savages  was a leftover, too), as well as on recommendation from  urlLink Dorian , who's a fan of the creators. And I got the newest  Ultimate Spider-Man  trade, too -- for some reason, that's the one ongoing series that I  only  buy in trades. Bendis' habit of padding storylines in US-M is less annoying when you get the whole story at once, I guess.

      Final musical confession of the night: the purest, most beautiful sound I may ever have heard in my entire life is Joni Mitchell's voice on "The River" (from her  urlLink Blue  album).

      Second musical confession: I think if "3 Small Words" hadn't been saddled with being part of the  urlLink Josie & the Pussycats Motion Picture Soundtrack , it could've been a moderate-to-huge radio hit.  In fact, that whole soundtrack is pretty rockin'. Music by Matthew Sweet and Fountains of Wayne's Adam Schlesinger, vocals by Letters to Cleo's Kay Hanley... it holds together as a pretty decent album in its own right.  No, seriously.  It's not up there in the truly  brilliant  but overlooked soundtrack division with Tom Petty's  urlLink She's the One , but still. At least download that one song from wherever you can. It's fun as hell.

      I haven't posted anything about music yet. So.  Musical confession: for the longest time, I misunderstood the meaning of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry."  If you listen to the lyrics, you can tell what he means by that refrain, "No woman, no cry," is basically, "Don't cry, woman." He's comforting a crying woman.  But the way  I  always interpreted it was: "If you don't have a woman, you won't have any reason to cry." Or more briefly, "Women will make you cry." If you don't want to cry, don't have a woman. No woman, no cry. Get it?  Yeah. It's pretty obvious why Bob Marley is the  urlLink legend , and I'm not.

      I'm in the middle of two books right now, so here's two half reviews.  The first is Janet Evanovich's  urlLink  One for the Money  , the first Stephanie Plum mystery. I like how Plum starts out from square one; she becomes a bounty hunter basically because she can't find any other job, and she has to learn as she goes, which means she makes a lot of mistakes. And it doesn't help her ego any that she gets rescued from her most severe peril by the guy she's supposed to be arresting.  Plum is flat broke (her car has been repossessed, and for breakfast she has the only thing in her fridge, one bottle of beer), but she's tough, foul-mouthed, sharp (it doesn't hurt that she seems to know everyone in New Jersey --  and  their mothers), and entertaining. I have no idea how her character progresses in later novels -- whether she remains a bounty hunter, or becomes a more traditional detective -- but I have a feeling I'll find out. It's a good read, good enough to want more.  The other book is Joe R. Lansdale's  urlLink  Captains Outrageous  , which I just bought yesterday. I'm reading it now instead of the Plum book (but that's only fair, because I started reading the Plum book to get a break from Neal Stephenson's  Quicksilver  -- and, if I may go off on a tangent, here, where the  hell  is the paperback version of  Quicksilver ? The second book of Stephenson's Baroque Cycle trilogy is out in hardback now, but according to  urlLink Amazon , the paperback of the first book isn't coming out till October. What gives? I got  Quicksilver  from the library, but there's no way I'm gonna finish it before it's due back. I'd like to buy it, but not at hardback prices. Irritating).   Captains Outrageous  is the sixth book in the Hap and Leonard series. I recently finished  urlLink  Bad Chili  , the fourth in the series. Why'd I start with #4 and #6? Because #4 was the only one at the library, and #6 was the only one at Barnes & Noble. The supply ain't meeting my demand. And I  do  demand the other books, because  Captains Outrageous  is as great as  Bad Chili .  The first chapter opens with Hap and Leonard as security guards at a chicken plant, and Lansdale's laidback humor is in full evidence:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any chickens try to break out?" I asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nope. None tried to break in either. How about on your side? Any trouble?"... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No chicken problems. I saw a suspicious wood rat out by the trees, but he didn't want any part of me." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I can see that." When they get going on what anatomical properties Hap (straight) and Leonard (gay) like in their partners, I laughed so much the people in Barnes & Noble (where I read the first few pages) thought I was crazy.  The second chapter shifts gears, and it left me slack-jawed and breathless at its sudden shocking brutality. Hap finds a man savagely beating a woman in the woods and tries to subdue him, but the man is out of his mind on drugs and near-unstoppable. And the third chapter, with Hap meeting the father of the woman in the woods, had me almost in tears.  From hysterics to horror to heartbreak in 25 pages. That's damn good writing. And that's before the  real  story even begins.  Lansdale has a gift for storytelling, and I couldn't recommend him more highly. This series especially, if you can handle a little rough dialogue and a little rough violence: you've got to give it a try.

      Adrian Monk has always been quirky, fearful, hamstrung by his neuroses. But when did he become so damn stupid?  In the two episodes I've seen of the new season of  urlLink  Monk  , Tony Shalhoub's title character, as well as his supporting cast, have taken to acting like complete idiots for the sake of a joke. In the season premiere, a gag about Monk trying to say something to Capt. Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), but being interrupted by a jackhammer, went on  forever . He must've started, and been interrupted, a good 30 times. Wouldn't a person with a brain in his head try to go inside to speak? Or wouldn't Stottlemeyer get the gist of what Monk was saying (it was something extremely simple, like, "Maybe we should talk to him"), and say, "I get it, let's go"? No. They both stand there for minutes on end, playing out this pathetic scene that could only happen between two characters who are feeble in the head.  On the most recent episode, a man died inside a panic room, and a hole was cut inside the door to get to him. When Monk later accidentally gets locked in the panic room, he... well, he  panics . But in an incredibly stupid fashion. While he's wailing and crying for help, Stottlemeyer is looking at him through the hole, shouting instructions at Monk on how to reopen the door. Monk, of course, acts as though he can't see or hear Stottlemeyer, because apparently the writers think that's "funny". It was an interminable vaudeville performed by an idiot.  In the same episode... man, I don't know where to begin. In the same episode, the murder victim's pet chimpanzee has been taken into custody as the prime suspect, and Capt. Stottlemeyer has decided to lock himself in a room with the chimp (to recreate the scene of the crime), give the chimp a gun, and see if it has the manual dexterity to actually pull the trigger. And  that's  not even the  stupid  part. Stupid part #1: the Captain's assistant, Lt. Disher, was supposed to give the Captain an unloaded gun to use, but he gave him a loaded gun by mistake. What policeman (outside of  urlLink Chief Wiggum ) is that careless about firearms? Stupid part #2, Stottlemeyer accepts Disher's word on the gun being unloaded, neither checking for himself, nor realizing the weight of the gun indicates it's loaded. Relatively minor, but it's an incredibly unrealistic portrayal of a policeman's attention to gun safety. But stupid part #3, the  really  stupid part, is when Disher realizes his mistake. He rushes to warn the Captain... but the Captain refuses to listen to him, or unlock the door, because he's involved with an extremely extended and totally unfunny pantomime, trying to incite the chimp into pulling the trigger. I mean, if you're a cop, and another cop is  screaming  and  pounding on the door , don't you think that would set off a little alarm in your head? Maybe you're not going to immediately leap to the conclusion, "This monkey has a loaded gun," because you'd have to be an idiot to be in a situation in the first place where that phrase would ever be relevant. But wouldn't you think that  something  might require your immediate attention, and you should maybe stop screwing around and find out what it is?  Idiots, all of them.  This show is losing a lot of goodwill from me.  Monk  is about a brilliant man who is handicapped by his mental tics, not a stupid man who just has to wash his hands a lot. The writers need to get back on the ball, pronto.

      Tonight, the fifth season of the best reality show ever begins:  urlLink  The Amazing Race  .  Where it stands head and shoulders above its competition is its direct correlation between ability and reward. There's no arbitrary system of elimination; you can't get voted out because you're nerdy-looking, or you don't share well, or for being  too  strong that your jealous teammates want you gone. It's a race, plain and simple. Eleven teams of two people have to get from point A to point B. If you're last, you're out. Straightforward and oh-so-sweet.  Part of the thrill comes from seeing the exotic and fascinating locations the race takes the contestants to; point A may be Morocco, and point B may be Thailand, and along the way you may have to stop at the Eiffel Tower, or Nelson Mandela's jail cell, or the Taj Mahal. But most of the fun comes from the insanely perfect casting, and the character conflicts and stories that arise from it.  There's always a team that you want to see succeed; for me, it's generally the wise guys, like  urlLink Kevin and Drew  from Season 1 ("It's  Namibia , jackass," said one to the other after mispronouncing their current location), or  urlLink Ken and Gerard  from Season 3. (And the wise guys have traditionally done surprisingly well. Don't underestimate the power of a joke and a smile to get a ticket agent to bump you up to a better flight.)  But, even better, there's always at  least  one team (usually more) that you hate with a passion; Season 1 had the infamous  urlLink Joe and Bill , aka the Guidos (a nickname they took from their pet dog), aka Bert and Ernie (the name everyone else called them), whose ruthless denigrating and sabotaging of other teams has yet to be matched. And in Season 3 (the odd-numbered seasons have been the best so far), there were Flo and Zach. Flo was the most incompetent, self-absorbed, whiny, evil little pestilence of a contestant on any reality show ever. Worse than  urlLink Omarosa ? By  miles , baby, by  miles . She'd pout, she'd complain, she'd bungle, she'd threaten to quit, and she'd blame it  all  on her partner (and her longtime "almost" boyfriend and obedient lap dog) Zach in  every single episode . Poor Zach, of the Zen-like countenance and seemingly infinite patience, who had to give her pep talks and (in some instances, literally) carry her every step of the way. Flo was the most undeserving player in the history of game shows. And what's worse?  urlLink She won.  (Well,  Zach  won, and she rode him like a donkey to the finish line.)  That's part of the agony and the ecstasy of  The Amazing Race . Skill is important, but luck plays a vital role as well. Sometimes the good guys miss their planes; sometimes the bad guys find a taxi driver who knows all the shortcuts. And the one lesson everyone should take into (and away from, I guess, if you're into lessons learned from reality TV) this show is  never give up . Even if you're hours behind the next team, they might pull a colossal blunder (as fully four teams out of eight did one year) and fill the tank of their diesel vehicle with unleaded. Whoops!  The editing of these shows is brilliant. You know where everyone is in relation to everyone else until the breakneck, breathless dash for the finish, which keeps you on the edge of your seat -- who will be eliminated next? I can't wait to find out tonight.

      Since I already wrote about the movie I saw over the weekend on  urlLink Saturday , I thought I'd delve into my TiVo saved programs for today's movie entry. And I'm going with one of my favorite films ever, and one most people have never even heard of:  urlLink  Kicking and Screaming  .  It features the King and Queen of Indie, Eric Stoltz and Parker Posey, in supporting roles, but it's Chris Eigeman who really owns the film. As a recent graduate, aimless and adrift, he's hilarious (chastising himself in the mirror: "Hello, my friend, my little friend... you do  nothing!  Max Beaumont does  nothing!  'Oh, Max, what do you do?' 'Oh... I do nothing.'"), and his character rings painfully true. He's never been better, and I've liked him in many, many things, including Whit Stillman's  Metropolitan  and  Barcelona  (which were an obvious influence on Noah Baumbach, writer/director of  Kicking ), and the TV shows  Malcolm in the Middle  and  It's Like, You Know . (On  Gilmore Girls  -- not so much.)   Kicking and Screaming  is definitely a comedy (Max to his new girlfriend, who is turning 17: "Wow, now you can read Seventeen magazine and get all the references"), but it creates such a poignant, nostalgic,  regretful  picture of college days -- all the missed opportunities you can't stop thinking about, your classes, your major, your romances -- as well as the time immediately  following  graduation, in which you realize your life has  really  just begun, and you're  still  not prepared for it, that it's tough for me to watch it very often. It's funny, but it's also filled with heartbreak, both romantic and otherwise. It's very similar to  Fandango  in that way for me. (There's another great but overlooked film you should all see, by the way.)  Also, like  Fandango , I can't listen to the film's closing song in the same way anymore. In  Fandango , it's Blind Faith's "Can't Find My Way Home" that plays over the credits; in  Kicking , it's Freedy Johnston's "Bad Reputation." It's impossible for me to hear those songs without thinking of their respective films, and feeling a little of the sadness that came at the end of each.  Noah Baumbach definitely peaked with this, his first film. It's been years since his last project (which, frankly, was awful); his next one,  The Squid and the Whale , is scheduled for production this year, and I sincerely hope it's better than his last couple. But he really hit it out of the park on  Kicking and Screaming . Check it out if you remember college, if you remember your first love, if you remember what it's like being "romantically self-destructive," as two characters decide to be in this film. For whatever reason -- even if it's only so that I know one more person who's seen the damn film -- check it out.

      I saw  Spider-Man 2  Saturday, and let me tell you, my friends, I was  not  disappointed. I was going to save this post till Monday, what's supposed to be my movie posting day, but I can't wait.  I laughed, I was exhilarated, I even choked up a little during a big emotional scene with Aunt May (wonderfully played by Rosemary Harris). (Don't judge me! You know you did, too!) It's the best action picture I've seen in ages, and easily one of the best films of the year.  This I can tell you without spoilers: the action is  tremendous , the trailers do  not  give away nearly as much as I'd feared, the CGI effects are still a little (just a little) iffy with Spider-Man, but with Doc Ock's arms they are absolutely  seamless , the Peter/Mary Jane relationship, as well as all the other crises in poor Peter Parker's life, are as interesting as the exploits of Spider-Man, and, best of all, this film is really,  really  funny in many scenes, especially those featuring J.K. Simmons, who is channeling the soul of J. Jonah Jameson right off the pages of the comics.  The rest involves spoilers great and small, so click and drag if you want to read more. But seriously: I'm spoiling  everything  here. Read only if you've seen the movie. And apologies to those who may have already posted similar thoughts; I gots to say what I thought, even if you already said it (and probably better).   Okay, first of all, more people couldn't know Spider-Man's secret identity if he took out a billboard in Times Square. A whole  train car  full of people? Geez. But at that point, Sam Raimi had utterly sold me on believing that not one of them would ever reveal his identity (as though any of them would recognize him, anyway). There's a hero inside all of us, as Aunt May said, and circumstances brought out the hero in a whole train car full of passengers.  And about Aunt May's speech: maybe she secretly suspects Spider-Man's identity, too? That's the major change from the comics that I approve of: Aunt May isn't a simpering, doddering, swooning, frightened old bird as she was in Stan Lee's days; she's a tough old broad, who can change her mind about Spider-Man if she damn well pleases. You can see her steel when she demands Peter accept $20 from her for his birthday. She's just great.  Harry also finds out Spidey's secret -- and Peter, Peter, Peter, you could've handled that better. "Right now this isn't about you and me," he says, when Harry repeats his accusation that Peter killed his father. Couldn't you at least have said, "No, I didn't -- but right now" etc? No, of course he couldn't, because Spider-Man always creates Peter Parker's own problems. Coming June 2006:  Spider-Man 3: Return of the Goblin .  Then Peter  deliberately  exposes his identity to Doc Ock. I mean, come on! But it still worked for me, mainly due to Alfred Molina's chilling, moving performance as Octavius. A change from the comic I  wasn't  fond of: Doc Ock's arms were always the danger, but Octavius himself has traditionally had a glass jaw. How in the hell can the movie Otto withstand  repeated  punches to the head from a man whose arms are strong enough to stop a runaway train?  Speaking of Otto: his big, potentially Nobel prize-winning experiment with fusion is great and all -- but those  arms!  Are those not enough to make a vast fortune and change the world in and of themselves? Harry Osborn is a crappy businessman.  And finally, and oh-so-satisfyingly, Mary Jane gets to see Spider-Man without the mask. It was a thrilling, fanboy moment for me, I have to admit. And just when you think Raimi is going to let Peter throw away Mary Jane's love  again , he serves up a curveball of a happy ending. (I mean, once I saw the film was continuing after I thought it would end, with Harry discovering his father's Green Goblin lair, I knew the ending would be happy -- it was the continuation itself that took me by surprise.) I wasn't wild about the movie cliche of a groom left at the altar, but again, I had so much goodwill towards the film and the characters, I could accept it.  And two excellent cameos took me by surprise (well, three, counting Bruce Campbell as an usher, in a funny bit): first, Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, in a very emotional dream/vision Peter has, in which he again intones the legendary line, "With great power comes great responsibility," while Peter tearfully counters with the equally legendary, "I am Spider-Man no more!"  urlLink (Link.)   And secondly, shockingly and powerfully, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. As Harry, having discovered his best friend is his most hated enemy, hears the maniacal laughter of his father echo around his empty penthouse, I thought, "I wonder if they had to get permission from Dafoe to use his voice for that laughter?" And then, POW -- there he is in person (well, in Harry's head, but you know what I mean). I've gotta give him credit for signing up for this small but key appearance. It made a great film even better.  One for the nerds: when Spidey caught the wall falling on Mary Jane, who else flashed on the classic Amazing Spider-Man #33: "The Final Chapter!"  urlLink (link) , one of Lee and Ditko's, and Spider-Man's, finest moments? Can't just be me.  And finally, a little praise for Tobey Maguire, who some people aren't thrilled with in this role: I think he's great; he conveys an understated soulfulness which some (and you know who you are) are writing off as emotionless. Kirsten Dunst, on the other hand, could've been given a bit more to do; I think she's great, too. And I also think it's great she's apparently signed a "nipples-showing-through-wet-clothing" clause for the entire trilogy. What a sport.   That's all!

      My site just got linked to by the first person who I totally don't know even a little bit in real life: Bill Sherman's  urlLink Pop Culture Gadabout .  Of course, I linked to his site first, but why wouldn't I? It's an excellent pop culture blog (as you may have inferred from the name), one which I discovered via Mike Sterling, and one very much like what I hope to achieve with this one. It covers a variety of media in a variety of ways, with in-depth analyses as well as brief observations, and it makes me want to check out the things he's talking about. Plus, he's a great speller.  I know this linking business isn't really all that big a deal, but hey, give me one brief moment to bask, would you?  Also, if I had thought about the way most link lists are organized alphabetically, I probably wouldn't have started my site's name with a "Y". Maybe I'll do like plumbers do in the yellow pages, and change it to "AAA You Know What I Like?"

      Finally got around to my leftover comics from Wednesday.  Ex Machina  gets off to a very interesting beginning, although the framing device, jumping back and forth in time, is more irritating here than when writer Vaughn uses it in his  Y: The Last Man . I like the artwork from Tony Harris, previously of  Starman . I'm hoping the comic sticks more to the political side of things, rather than jumping into costumed superhero stuff. A superpowered mayor, I've never seen. A superhero in a costume, I have. And  Astonishing X-Men  has failed to astonish me. It's just okay so far. The idiotic Cyclops costume continues to irk me. But at least the dialogue is well written, and Whedon is taking the characters in  somewhat  interesting directions -- Scott has lost his ability to lead, Hank may want to give up being a mutant. I'll probably stick with it for another issue or two.  I forgot to mention my impression of the new  Doom Patrol  by John Byrne. I'm not a huge Byrne fan; I think he  can  be good, but I don't think he  has  been for a while. His  JLA  run with Chris Claremont was  horrible , painfully horrible. But I was still willing to give  Doom Patrol  a try, just for the hell of it -- until, while still at the comic store, with the issue in my hand,  urlLink Mike  mentioned that it proceeded directly from that  JLA  story. I think it actually shocked Mike that I instantly turned around, walked right back to the new comics shelf, and put the comic back on the rack.  That  is how much I hated Byrne's run on  JLA , and that is also probably the last time I consider trying a Byrne comic just for the hell of it.  And don't forget, folks -- FREE COMIC DAY TOMORROW! Get 'em while the gettin's good!

      Tonight it's all about the poker. Ideally, I've got a real-life poker game to attend, but since  urlLink Schleprock  has better luck than I do, the plans'll probably fall apart. Thankfully, I have an emergency back-up plan in place:  Celebrity Poker Showdown  on Bravo.  Tonight is the two-hour final table, in which the winners from the previous rounds compete for the grand prize for their charities. Also, I've got last week's episode still unwatched on my TiVo. Sadly, I already know who won that game (if you don't know, I won't spoil it for you, but her initials are Maura Tierney), but I'll watch the sumbitch anyway.  Tonight's final table consists of Rosario Dawson (who should be first eliminated, if there's any justice; she's a terrible player, who got very, very lucky), Dule Hill (who also was incredibly lucky, but still had a certain amount of skill as well), Michael Ian Black (who beat Norm McDonald in the best episode so far this season), Lauren Graham (whom I  love , and will be rooting for), and Maura. Who, hey, I just realized! She was host Dave Foley's girlfriend on  NewsRadio , one of my favorite sitcoms ever. Funny I didn't make that connection until just now.  Speaking of Dave: what's the over/under on how drunk he's going to be tonight? I'm saying drunk enough to forget Maura Tierney's name, and to make an ass of himself by interrupting the game, but not quite drunk enough to pick a fight with giant co-host Phil Gordon. Seriously, that guy's gotta be nine feet tall.

      Went to my  urlLink friendly neighborhood comics shop  Wednesday and wound up hanging out with employees  urlLink Mike ,  urlLink Dorian , and  urlLink Chris , as well as fellow comics fiends  urlLink Corey  and  urlLink Ian , for a good hour and a half. Good times. One of our conversation topics was about our Irish chins, all of which (but Corey's) are oh-so-cleverly concealed behind facial hair. Chris, who isn't Irish, felt left out, but we all decided that half Mexican plus half Jewish equals Irish, and that seemed to cheer the lad right up.  Anyway. Only three new comics today, a light and inexpensive load for me, but I collected a bundle of back issues as well, and wound up putting a serious hurt on my bank account after all. Hooray?     Batman: Harley and Ivy  Part 3 of a 3-part mini. Another funny issue from Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, featuring Harley and Ivy's misadventures in Hollywood. Very reminiscent of the work the two did on the  Batman  cartoon -- but with a more adult slant. Which I think  must  be confusing parents and kids alike. A cursory glance reveals the same cartoony art style found in the children's comic  Batman Adventures , but a closer look reveals:  Lingerie shot. Lingerie shot. Panty shot. Panty shot. Bra shot. Ass shot. Panties around  ankles  shot. Shower shot. Shower shot. Shower shot. Panty shot. Partial bare boob shot. Panty shot. Panty shot. Towel shot. And so forth and so on. There's a  reason  this book isn't approved by the Comics Code Authority. It's very naughty, in an innocent way, if that makes sense. Good clean dirty fun.    Invincible  My favorite new series of the past year (or so) continues to satisfy. In the aftermath of last issue's brutal battle between father and son, an important new government agent character is introduced, Mark learns more about what his father did for a living, new relationships are formed, both inside and outside the superhero world, and Mark's got a new job. Which, after being so utterly betrayed by his father, seems like a foolish thing to jump into as blindly as he does, but hey, the kid's still learning. Robert Kirkman has quickly become one of my favorite writers, and Ryan Ottley continues to impress with his sharp, clean artwork.  Invincible  is one of my five current favorites.    The Punisher  After the amazing previous storyline, in which longtime Punisher ally Micro met his shocking, extremely graphic end at the hands (well, shotgun) of the Punisher himself, this new story feels like a muddled let-down. Something about the IRA and pirates on the East River and some old guy who cuts up people real good and a bomb expert who's missing nine-tenths of his face and a dreadlocked, gold-toothed gangster and oh, I just stopped caring. Maybe I was just tired when I read this issue, but it stopped making sense around page three. Too much plot getting in the way of the action, as  urlLink Joe Bob  would say.    She-Hulk  I've been hearing a lot of good things about this title -- "It's not what you'd expect!" -- so I finally broke down and bought the first four issues. (Corey was pleased that both I and Ian were buying it.) And it's a good fun book. The artwork is nice -- although, in some action sequences (such as the one with MODOK in outer space), it's a little hard to tell what's going on -- and the writing is clever and humorous. The book's about She-Hulk, after she's screwed up her life with excessive partying (losing her job and getting kicked out of the Avengers mansion in the process), getting hired by a prestigious law firm that handles supernormal clients -- but the catch is, they don't want She-Hulk, they want her non-powered alter ego, Jessica Walters. I have minor complaints about She-Hulk's/Jen's seeming inability to stand up for herself, whether it be against the Avengers or her bitchy new co-worker, and I think it's a little unlikely the Avengers would've gone straight to kicking her out of the mansion without having a talk with her first, but hey, you gotta get the plot and conflict  somehow . And like I said, minor complaints. I've heard the book's in danger of cancellation. Which just figures, now that  I've  finally started liking it.  I also picked up  Ex Machina  (by Brian K. Vaughn, writer of  Y: The Last Man  -- another of my current favorites) and  Astonishing X-Men , both of which I forgot to get last week. I've got nothing to add about them that hasn't been said already. (Oh, and also, I haven't read them yet.)  And on Corey's recommendation, I got an issue of  Brit , by  Invincible  writer Kirkman, but I didn't read it yet, either. Possible follow-up post later today.

      I've been a little comics heavy on the blog recently, so to balance things out, my defense of the much-maligned James Bond film,  urlLink  On Her Majesty's Secret Service  .       Not only do I disagree with the apparent majority opinion that it's the  worst  James Bond film, I actually think it's one of the  best  -- top three, at least. (And how anyone can think this is the worst when  A View to a Kill  exists is beyond me.) If Sean Connery had stuck around to star in it, I think everyone would agree it was the  very  best.  Let's get this out of the way right off the bat: George Lazenby is no Sean Connery. I know that. He's not my favorite actor, either. In fact, he's almost certainly the worst actor of the five to have played Bond in the series (the "official" series; I'm not counting the Bond spoof  Casino Royale ). I personally liked Roger Moore less in the role than Lazenby, but judging purely on acting skills, Moore was better. Lazenby was a novice actor in a high profile gig taking over from an incredibly popular predecessor, under a great deal of pressure to fill an iconic role. He couldn't possibly meet such expectations, even from those who bothered to give him a chance. That said, Lazenby wasn't  terrible . He actually wasn't half bad -- certainly not as bad as some people want to believe he was. He definitely had the look, and, though wooden at times, he musters enough charm and competence to get by.  The Bond girl, on the other hand, was excellent. Diana Rigg had already made her name on  The Avengers , and she's great in this film,  playing a similarly strong, smart, dangerous, beautiful woman. Who eventually caves to Bond's seduction, sure, but what kind of a Bond film would it be without that? The fact that Bond actually gets married to her sets a milestone in Bond's character development, and the development of the series as a whole. No other Bond film has had such an emotional core to it.  Blofeld is the ultimate Bond villain, and he exacts the ultimate vengeance against Bond -- by killing his wife, Blofeld takes away the  only  thing Bond has ever loved. James Bond, for all the women he's gone through, has never cared for any of them. He's at heart a cruel and selfish man. The fact that he allows himself to fall in love in this film marks a real change in the character, which makes her death all the more powerful. And Telly Savalas is  great  as Blofeld.  The film's snow chase is also one of the most spectacular stunt scenes in any Bond film -- which makes it one of the best stunt scenes ever filmed. Ah, for a return to the days when actual  people  performed stunts, rather than computerized images!  The film has its faults: Blofeld's evil plan is kind of dopey, but then, so are the plans of most of the Bond villains. And Lazenby's looking at the camera at the beginning of the film and muttering a complaint about "the other guy" (meaning Connery) was a jarring, awkward, integrity-breaking way to get things started. But the film makes up for it in so many ways, from the scenery and music (yes, even the music is great) on up. If you like the Bond films, but have always had something against this one, I say give it another chance -- this time, without thinking every other second, "Connery was better". Of  course  he was. But thinking like that keeps you from enjoying a great film.

       Bite Club : This one isn't really holding up in the long run. First Risa has her silly, kitty cat-inspired epiphany last issue; this issue Leto goes from good guy to bad way too quickly to be convincing. One minute he's a priest, next minute he's taking over the crime family, feeding the Monsignor to the crocodiles, giving his sister a hot kiss, and banging his old girlfriend. This book never transcended its "vampire gangsters" high concept the way I hoped it would.   Challengers of the Unknown : On the other hand, I think Chaykin's other book is getting better each issue. More backstory filled in, more frighteningly evil activity from the Fox News surrogates, and now this religious mysticism -- when she says "Holy Grail," is that a euphemism, or is that  really  the Holy Grail? I  still  couldn't name the five Challengers for you, but I'm fascinated by their story, and Chaykin's storytelling with his art is fantastic.   Captain America : I am really disappointed with this book. Kirkman's writing, which I enjoy so much elsewhere, is mediocre at best here. It's by turns corny, obvious, and dumb. Seriously, Diamondback slips a mickey into Cap's drink?  That's  the Red Skull's brilliant evil plan? Lame. And the SHIELD conspiracy is even lamer, falling for a trick from Red Skull more obvious than "Throw me the idol, I'll throw you the whip." And  Batroc?  What the?  Laaaaaame.  And what's with Batroc saying he's never seen Captain America so brutal? #1, Cap certainly is nowhere near "brutal" here, and #2, Batroc obviously missed those Marvel Knights issues where Cap was nothing but an intense, "brutal" downer. Kirkman is trying to make Cap lighter  and  more brutal at the same time, and you simply can't have it both ways. He's aiming for goofy, old school fun (I presume), but he's really missing the mark. I had high hopes for Kirkman coming over to Marvel; I'm still looking forward to his  Marvel Team-Up , but much less so now.   SpyBoy : Pop Mhan's art looks different, and nowhere near as good as it normally does. Is it just me? Is it a rush job? Is the inker not quite getting his style? What? And this story seems off to me. Alex's grandfather and the SHIRTS agent seem surprised by the appearance of SpyBoy, when they really shouldn't be. And if SpyBoy is going after SpyGuy with extreme prejudice, why  didn't  he just shoot him when he had the chance? This story isn't coming together very well for me at all.   Fables : Now  that's  a hell of a next-issue teaser: Frankenstein vs. the Wolf Man! Cool. Too bad Mark Buckingham is off the art chores for this story; I can't tell one damn soldier from another. This issue is a decent enough interlude, but I'd rather get back to the main Fables action. This is only going to be a two-issue story, right?   Powers : Okay, we learn a little more about the new Retro Girl. Could she be the original Retro Girl's daughter? Could Walker be a daddy? I have no idea if that's the conclusion I'm supposed to be reaching or not. And Deena may be a badass in the interrogation room, but she really needs some lessons in her field work. She's  always  getting her ass kicked. Why would she go by  herself  to a superpowered suspect's door? An okay issue, mostly for the interrogation stuff, but not great.  It seems like I'm forgetting something. I usually do. Oh well.

      I gave up on  The Punisher  this week. I had it in my hand, and finally forced myself to put it back on the shelf. I hate this stupid, meandering,  boring  storyline! Why should I stick around for three more issues of it, other than a foolish, masochistic desire to be a "completist"? I'll be back when you're done with this one, Ennis.  And as I've recently mentioned (more than once, I believe), I gave up on the Bruce Jones  Incredible Hulk  ages ago. But I had to page through issue #75 at the store, because it actually  looked  like a Hulk comic, with the Hulk clearly pictured on the cover and everything. And the Hulk even appears inside! It's a Christmas miracle!  It's far too late for me to want to jump back in now, even if this looked like a good issue (which, aside from the Hulk actually appearing in a Hulk comic, it  doesn't ), but at least this should clear up some questions from  urlLink Sean Collins  (no relation) (that makes sense if you know my last name is also Collins). He recently posted some questions about Jones' run (in response to  urlLink one of my posts , hooray for me), and I'm guessing this issue holds some answers for him. Well, I know it holds  one  answer, at least (the answer he already guessed), but as for his other question, whether Jones will finish his big conspiracy storyline before he leaves the title -- this issue certainly looks like it's wrapping things up. Which is good for Marvel. If I'd been following that story for as long as it's been going on, and it abruptly ended without resolving anything, I do believe I'd storm the Marvel offices with pitchfork and torch in hand.  Also didn't buy  X-Force  #1, which was a no-brainer on my part. Man, it looks  exactly  like the first  X-Force  #1, from, like, twelve years ago, when I actually  had  no brain, and purchased multiple copies, because comics will make you rich! Idiot.   urlLink Mike  pointed out some choice artistic crimes within the covers (one panel in particular, in which one character appears to be 18 feet tall in comparison to the woman kneeling in front of him -- ew, not kneeling like  that!  Get your minds out of the gutter), and then added that he had asked the owner of his shop if he could punch anyone who bought it. Permission granted, soldier!

      I wish  I  were the world's biggest fan of something.   urlLink Mike  is the world's biggest Swamp Thing fan.  urlLink Corey  is the world's biggest Green Lantern fan.  urlLink Dorian  is the world's biggest Wildcat fan.  urlLink Neilalien  is the world's biggest Dr. Strange fan.  urlLink Laura "Tegan" Gjovaag  is the world's biggest Aquaman fan.  I'd like to say I'm the world's biggest Incredible Hulk fan, but if that were true,  I  would've been the one to create the brilliantly funny (but too-infrequently updated)  urlLink Hulk's Diary . Plus, I'm only a fan when the comic doesn't suck, which it currently does. It's possible I'm the world's biggest Grimjack fan, but only if  urlLink Uncle   urlLink Elvis  has left the building. Hell, I thought I might even be the world's biggest Replacement God fan, but even an obscure (but excellent) b&w fantasy/humor comic that hasn't released a new issue in five years has its own (mostly abandoned)  urlLink fan site .  So I'm just going to pick something and go with it. As of now, I am officially the world's biggest fan of...  Rick Jones.  Author, folk singer, talk show host, professional sidekick. He was indirectly responsible for the creation of the Hulk; he was Captain America's replacement Bucky; he was sidekick to Space Knight Rom; he was bonded via the nega-bands to  two  Captain Marvels.  I am now his biggest fan in the world. (Prove me wrong, children, prove me wrong!) And I will not rest until Rick Jones gets his own ongoing monthly series! Or until I get bored with him.

      TV: I'm getting way behind in my TV watching, which isn't healthy for my TiVo at all. It's backlogged with episodes of  The 4400 ,  Insomniac with Dave Attell ,  Less Than Perfect , the movie  Clerks , and, unbelievably enough, last week's  Amazing Race , which I usually watch as soon as possible. I think I'm nearing the TiVo danger zone, where shows are going to be automatically deleted to make room on the hard drive, if I'm not careful.  Speaking of TiVo, I'm a little alarmed by reports ( urlLink found via Mark Evanier ) that it's not doing so well, business-wise. Which I can't believe.  Everyone  should have one. It's the greatest invention since... well,  television . They're dropping the prices this month. You  must  get one, I'm telling you.    MOVIES:  urlLink  Run, Ronnie, Run    I loved Bob Odenkirk and David Cross'  Mr. Show , which spawned this film, but I didn't much care for the film itself. For one thing, it's inspired by a sketch from the show which I never liked in the first place: Ronnie Dobbs, a poor, stupid, white trash troublemaker, becomes famous for being arrested multiple times on a  Cops -like show, and eventually an entire show is built around him getting arrested every single week. The movie stretches this thin concept way beyond its breaking point, while adding in various weak satires of other reality shows (a  Survivor  rip-off in which the losers are killed and eaten), and it fails to ever really pick up steam.  There are tons of cameos by some very funny people (such as Ben Stiller, Garry Shandling, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Patton Oswalt, Scott Thompson, Patrick Warburton, and, most random of all, Jeff Goldblum), but they never really  do  anything funny. I mean, when you've got Dave Foley  and  Andy Richter   and   Sarah Silverman in the same scene, and my only response is, "Eh," you're doing something  wrong . The only one of these cameos that worked for me was Jack Black's performance of a hilariously vulgar song in a "deleted scene" from a  Mary Poppins -esque musical.  There were a number of laughs throughout the film; I especially enjoyed the music video interlude by faux soul group Three Times One Minus One (played by Bob and David), and a Mortal Kombat-style fight scene toward the end had me in stitches. But I mostly felt like this film was a series of missed opportunities. The central concept could've been utilized to better effect, and the film could've been funnier still if the central concept weren't such a dud to begin with. Good job on putting Nikki Cox in a bikini for most of her scenes, though. Very good job.    "Summer, if you grade-grub one more time... I will send you back to the first grade."  I have to admit, I did a little grade-grubbing yesterday. About 7:30 PM, I noticed that I had 89 hits via my Sitemeter counter. So I pinged my blog (that sounds dirty) to get it refreshed on the  urlLink Comic Weblog Updates  page. I'm not proud of myself. But I finally got triple digits in hits, which I take pride in. Oh, wait, I guess I am proud of myself. Anyway, just before midnight, the site received its 100th hit of the day, which is a landmark for me. Drinks are on the house!

      I caught last night's  SportsCenter  -- the 90-minute special edition called  SportsCenter Old School . These special editions, which will be running all week in celebration of ESPN's 25th anniversary, feature alumni of the show returning to once again take the anchor's chair and call the highlights. Last night, it was Craig Kilborn coming back to take a seat next to Dan Patrick. And as I watched, I realized: not only do I not miss the smug and smarmy Craig Kilborn, I don't even miss  SportsCenter .  The last time I watched the show with any regularity was about four or five years ago, when I worked in an office with a big football pool, and felt like I had to do my homework. Nowadays, I'll watch football when it's on (NFL only, no college -- unless Cal is playing, and come on, how often does  that  get televised?), and I'll occasionally sit still for a Dodgers game called by Vin Scully, or the women's nine-ball tournaments, which for some reason I  love , or the odd tennis match or three, or golf if it's Tiger Woods  and  Phil Mickelson. But I certainly don't care about what's happening in all those  other  sports events I'm not watching, which makes  SportsCenter  kind of useless for me.  Especially since it's so goddam annoying. (Back me up here,  urlLink King Kaufman .) The point of  SportsCenter  long ago ceased to be delivering sports highlights; the point is for the anchor to insert himself into the highlights with his "wry" "hip" "humor" and "clever" catchphrases.  Old School  illustrated this fact by showing highlight reels of Kilborn's catchphrases, having Patrick quiz Kilborn on his catchphrases, having Kilborn first coyly refuse to revive the catchphrases as he read the baseball highlights, which became redundant and annoying enough to be a catchphrase unto itself ("No catchphrases, that's simply a home run"), and finally having Kilborn use every one of his not-so-fondly-remembered catchphrases after all ("Jumanji!" "Krakatoa!"), even adding a few new ones ("You stay classy, San Diego," straight out of  Anchorman ).  All the current  SportsCenter  anchors are guilty of this catchphrase style of announcing to some degree or another, but it's Stuart "Booyah!" Scott who is currently the most egregious offender. He so desperately wants to be stolen away from ESPN by a major network, or to host his own talk show, that it almost hurts to watch him. But Chris Berman's nickname-game isn't far behind in terms of obnoxiousness.  The only two  SportsCenter  catchphrases I've ever enjoyed aren't even  SportsCenter  catchphrases. The first is "Sweet sassy molassey!" from the classic  Saturday Night Live  send-up of  SportsCenter , as spoken by Ray Romano (which, of course, the ESPN people immediately appropriated for themselves). The second is of nebulous origin: I seem to recall that it was from a Rich Eisen-hosted ESPN game show, a very short-lived one ( not   2-Minute Drill ), and I believe Peter Gammons was actually the contestant (maybe this was some  20th  anniversary special show that I'm not recalling correctly). Anyway, the question was, "Which of the following is  not  a catchphrase used to describe a home run on  SportsCenter ?" I forget the other three choices, but the correct answer, the one  not  used, was "a four-base hit," which was by far my favorite. Wouldn't you like to hear the sentence, "And Barry Bonds gets a four-base hit!" "That is an upper deck four-base hit for Sosa!"  I was kind of looking forward to watching all of the  Old School  specials this week, catching everyone's return appearances (except for Keith Olbermann, who is still hated at ESPN, and wasn't invited back). Now, I'm thinking I'll just watch whatever the heck I want to watch on TV tonight, but describe whomever I'm watching as being "en fuego," or shout out some random word, Tourette's-like, every few seconds: "Yahtzee!" "Roanoke!" "San Buenaventura!" That should be about the same.

      Franklin Harris of  urlLink Franklin's Findings  has directed my attention to  urlLink Sky.com's report on the mathematical formula for the Ultimate Horror Movie . The formula is  (es+u+cs+t) squared +s+ (tl+f)/2 + (a+dr+fs)/n + sin x - 1 . Feel free to click the link if you give a rat's ass what all that crap stands for.  Franklin goes on to note the formula's fatal flaw: it "has no variable for 'gratuitous nudity.'" Too true, Franklin, too true.  urlLink Joe Bob Briggs  must be spinning in his grave. I suggest the immediate addition of variable  gn  to the formula. In fact, I think it calls for an entire subset of variables:    to : topless only    ff : full frontal    ss : shower scene    sd : skinny dipping    sp : strip poker    sm : strip Monopoly ( urlLink Captain Corey  had better get that reference)    nws : nudity without sex    swn : sex without nudity (makes baby Jesus cry)    kwn : killed while nude    kfbn : killed for being nude    kbn : killed by nudist   And, most important of all:    nbsyaho : nudity by someone you've actually heard of   ...which means, for example, that although  urlLink  Vampire Lesbian Kickboxers   may have more  total  nudity, it would be outranked by  urlLink  Dressed to Kill   for its Angie Dickinson shower scene.  There is a small possibility I may have given this entirely too much thought....  Nah!  As if that were  possible!

      Every once in a while I like to click around the  urlLink IMDb  chatboards. If you think  comic  boards are filled with trolls, fools, hotheads, people ignorant of any basic concept of grammar or spelling, etc. -- trust me, they're  nothing  compared to IMDb.  This week I ran across  urlLink a thread on the Orlando Bloom page  which was started by an obvious troll, but which has received 90 responses so far:    shegami : Hi. This be Shegami. I be good good hacker. I hack into Orlando computer and see he look at many site for engagement ring. So Shegami think Orlando be get marry soon. So too bad all you girl who love Orlando so so much. He going to marry probably Kate!!!! Hahahahaha!!!!!   Love and kisses and hug,  Shegami All the girl who love Orlando so so much immediately take the bait:    Sugahunni : Thats stupid! He probably doesnt have a computer he hates the new technology. ...which, if true, makes Orlando seem dumber than anyone on his boards. Yes, shun the new technology, Orlando, that'll make it go away.

That's enough to make  me  hate the new technology.   AssortedDonutHoles  chimes in by pointing out that  shegami  is a troll, and it's stupid to respond. But since  AssortedDonutHoles  is clearly smarter than 99.9% of the participants on the IMDb boards, the responses continue.  It really gets hilarious when  CheLiTo ChiP  chimes in to correct  shegami :    CheLiTo ChiP : Shegami need to enter to english academy and learn to spell right!   shegami : You think you so smart. Shegami be good good speller. Look at all Shegami words. They all spell correct. Shegami NEVER misspell word. And Shegami have English as second language. Do you speak Japanese? NO THINK SO!   Love and kisses and hug,  Shegami   CheLiTo ChiP : I'll correct your text for you to see little girl,   You think you  are  so smart. Shegami  is a good speller. Look at all Shegami words. They  are  all correct. Shegami NEVER  mispelled  a word. And Shegami  has English as  a second language. Do you speak japanese?  I DON'T THINK SO!     love, kisses and hugs    Okay little girl, let me tell you, you need to learn somethings yet!! I actually speak chinese which is similar than Japanese but kind of easier.  Then, my first languge is spanish. I live in Southamerica but I'm half chinese and half american. So, LMAO! I love how she misspelled "mispelled". I think  CheLiTo ChiP  works as a copy editor for  urlLink Harry Knowles .  Soon  missyemmie14  is leaping to  CheLiTo ChiP 's defense.    missyemmie14 : and shegami we just spell wrong cuz it's internet lingo. we do it because it's alot faster then typing this with all capitals and crap like that. ur a freak wow u know english like one of your poeple know english but ALOT of americans nkow japanese and other languages. ur porbably one of the only japanese poeple who noes english. because america is diverse. but japanese poeple r dumb. china is like 100% better they rule u! Wow. Is 14 her age, or IQ?   shegami  then goes on to insist she can hack into people's brains, because of the chips implanted by the American government.    shegami : Dear sparrowsrum123,  Shegami be glad you like thread. You be good good fan of Orlando. Shegami read chip and see you be nice person, but you sometime be scare because you think maybe alien come and kidnap you and take you to spaceship. This be deep thought that be in subconcious brain. But it okay, it okay. Lot of people scare of alien.   Love and kisses and hug,  Shegami   P.S. Orlando maybe be scare of alien too. He go to alien website before. Shegami no sure if he really scare of alien because he no have chip in brain, but he go to alien site two time. Eventually, it all collapses into a troll vs. troll battle, but before it does, we get my  favorite  exchange in the entire thread:    iamfinethx : you be elite haxor, yes.   camapily : h4x0r, learn how to spell, dumbass.

      I've been saying for a while now that, despite the seemingly unanimous praise from everyone else, Darwyn Cooke's  The New Frontier  has failed to blow me away.  Then I read issue #5.  From Hal Jordan's experimenting with the Green Lantern ring and almost dropping a mountain on himself, to Superman's and Batman's meeting, with Superman questioning Batman's new child-friendly appearance, to Jimmy Olsen's "Well jeez, Rocky. He's  Superman ", to Aquaman's "At my back, the largest army in the world", to the bloodied interior of Wonder Woman's invisible plane, to Lois Lane's "You get this shot or  I'll throw you off this goddamned chopper! ", to the blurry first view of the Centre, to Flash taking up his costume again, to Hal's "Let me tell you something Miss Rich Bitch", to his and Carol's kiss in front of the jet engine, to the destruction of Paradise Island, to Superman's "I see I have your attention" and his rousing speech --  Yeah. This was the one that blew me away.

      I'm late on this week's comics reviews, but I have a valid excuse: I was absolutely  overwhelmed  with the sheer volume of new comics I purchased this week. I truly went overboard. I mean, here's the list:  1)  Y: The Last Man   Oh, I guess that's it. So really, I have no excuse, and I'm just a lazy bastard.  Here's my review:  I liked it. Naked butts are funny. The end.  Okay, wait, I've got one or two other thoughts. Number one is, of course, what a great ending it was. After 25 issues, it's about damn time we saw what Beth was up to in Australia! Now, I just hope they don't drop her for another 25 issues. I get the feeling the next arc will feature Beth in a big way, though  urlLink Dorian , for one, does not -- he tells me that solicitation info for the next issues indicates it's more adventures with Yorick, this time in San Francisco. Well, Vaughn can switch back and forth from Yorick to Beth, can't he?  Also, I get the feeling a lot of people were a little unhappy with this two-part story, but I enjoyed it, both for Yorick reaching a big milestone (the last man on Earth  finally  gets laid! Geez, Abe Vigoda would've gotten lucky before this guy), the shots Vaughn (via Beth #2) took at the  Left Behind  books in part one, and just the overall feel that this was a breather between bigger stories. It was a fine change of pace -- but I'm ready for something big to happen next.  Other stuff I bought:   Ultimate X-Men: The New Mutants  TPB, which I haven't read yet. It's Bendis, I had to get it. It's a sickness.   PvP at large , which I  have  read, and which had me laughing out loud many times. Kurtz has a great cartooning style (although I noticed in this book that some of his lines look a little rough-edged, possibly due to transferring the strips from computer to print; I don't know for sure if he does all his art directly on the computer, but I kind of assume he does, which unfortunately results in a little pixellation-blur in the printing process), and the jokes are funnier for the characters' facial expressions (sometimes just a raised eyebrow works) and well-developed personalities.   The New Frontier , issues 4 and 5. I'd gotten the first and second issues because of all the wild praise they were getting, and I wasn't blown away. I dropped the book, but then Ian and Corey were raving about it at the store on Wednesday, so I decided to give it another shot -- no copies of #3 were to be found, though. I read #4 last night, and liked it better than the first two, but still, I'm not feeling the overwhelming love for it everyone else is. Maybe when I get all six, I'll appreciate it more. This is a lot of money I'm investing in a hunch (that I  will  gain appreciation for it); I mean, it's seven damn bucks a pop! I  am  looking forward to reading #5 tonight, because I know Hal Jordan is finally getting his Green Lantern ring, and I've heard all about the Wonder Woman/Invisible Jet sequence, which sounds really cool.

      Now that I'm actually getting a certain amount of regular traffic at this site (it's still double digits, but it's  high  double digits, baby!), I need to be more diligent in my updating. Maybe a little something in the morning, just anything to let people know I still exist (like this post), followed by something with a little more thought behind it when I've got the time.  Let me take a moment to acknowledge the fine bloggers who have linked to me in the past couple days (such as  urlLink Jog - The Blog ,  urlLink Polite Dissent , and  urlLink Blog THIS, Pal! ), or, even better, have actually mentioned me specifically in a post (like  urlLink Bloggity-Blog-Blog-Blog ,  urlLink Ringwood Ragefuck  or  urlLink The Comic Treadmill , which I almost forgot about because, for some reason, that link doesn't appear in a  urlLink Technorati  search of my web address --  almost  forgot, but didn't, because it was such a swell mention).  And that's not even mentioning  urlLink Progressive Ruin , by good ol' Mikey Sterling, who is the founder and patron saint of the Associated Comics And Pop Culture Webloggers Of Ventura County, CA And Outlying Environs (or ACAPCWOVCCAOE, which, hilariously enough, he actually pronounced as a word at the comic shop on Wednesday-- I had to admire the obvious effort he had put into developing and memorizing the pronunciation). He's always willing to throw me some of his outrageously voluminous web traffic by mentioning me in a post. The other fellas in that group,  urlLink Dorian ,  urlLink Ian , and  urlLink Corey , are always more than worth checking out as well (as long as I'm in name-drop mode).  In summary: thanks, all, for stopping by. A regular comics post will follow soon.

      Yesterday, at the comic shop, I bought the new  urlLink  PvP   collection:       There was something oddly familiar about the cover. I stared at it for a long while, until it finally hit me:       If I hadn't already been a fan of Scott Kurtz, I would be now. That's just pure genius. And there can't be more than one person out of a hundred who would get that. I'm extremely proud of myself, in a kind of ashamed way.

      You know what I like? The Incredible Hulk.  I've always liked him. Ever since my first comic reading days as a kid, I liked how he was different. He wasn't like all those other superheroes, who went around looking for someone to help -- looking for trouble, basically. The Hulk didn't want trouble. The Hulk just wanted to be  left alone . I loved that. The Hulk just wanted to kick back in the forest, away from all the puny humans, feed grass to an innocent deer who didn't know to be afraid of the green monster, compose some haikus, I don't know -- and then some dumbass supervillain would  always  come along and drop a building on the Hulk's head. And so the Hulk would have no choice but to   GRRRAAAARRRRRR HULK SMASH!!   and whale the holy living shit out of the bad guy. The Hulk didn't go looking for supervillains. The Hulk didn't give a gamma-irradiated rat's  ass  about supervillains. He wasn't proactive, he was purely reactive. Mess with Hulk, Hulk smash.  Also, the Hulk was the strongest one there was. And you knew because he would tell you: "Hulk is strongest one there is!!" There wasn't  anybody  who could beat the Hulk in a straight-up fight. Even Thor -- who's a  god , for crying out loud -- could only fight him to a draw, at best. How sweet is that?  And best of all: half the time he was puny Banner, so  nobody would see it coming.  The element of surprise, turning the tables on the assholes -- that was great. I mean, you see a giant pile of orange rocks walking down the street, you go, "Hey, it's the Thing." But not the Hulk. He's just this meek little rocket scientist -- and then some hooligans start thinking they can get tough with him, or maybe they just won't stop talking on their cell phones in a movie theater. Next thing you know, they're standing in the shadow of (if I may quote) "7 feet, 1,000 pounds of unfettered fury!" and crying for their mommies. Now  that's  comedy.  Then, of course, came the TV show.  The Incredible Hulk  TV series changed a ton of stuff from the comic -- from the main character's name ("Bruce" was deemed too effeminate for a hero, so they called him "David" instead), to his backstory (adding a wife who died in a car accident) to how he became the Hulk (self-administered dose of radiation, rather than accidental exposure), to the Hulk's strength (bullets could actually  hurt  him, rather than just bouncing off) and speech (rather than childish language, the Hulk never spoke at all), to who was tracking him down (not the obsessed General "Thunderbolt" Ross and Ross's daughter, Betty, who loved Banner, but some reporter named McGee). But it was still great. Where else could a nine-year-old see primetime superhero live-action on TV? (Well,  Wonder Woman , I guess, but that was fun for an entirely different reason, even at that age.) "Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry." So true, so true.  The Hulk is even what got me back into comics. In 1988, my freshman year of college, down at the Student Union there were these guys handing out "welcome packages" -- little boxes with various crap from local merchants inside, like shaving cream or scotch tape or whatever. And there were some comic books, too. I hadn't collected or even read comics for about 8 years, but when I read that issue of  The Incredible Hulk  in my welcome package, I was instantly hooked again. Because the Hulk was... he was  grey ! And he was  smart!  And a little bit...  bad , too. He was cunning, devious. Banner was on a mission, and the Hulk was  cooperating  with him, but for his own selfish reasons. And the art was very new and striking, stylized in a way that was totally different from the comics I had read as a kid, much more dynamic, and grittier, too -- drawn by some guy named Todd McFarlane (who has done little of note since then).  It was all wrong! And totally compelling. I bought a slew of back issues (all written by the fantastically entertaining Peter David, who would stay with the series for about 13 years, an amazing run from beginning to end), and I was suddenly a comic book fan again.  The there's the movie. I liked  Hulk  (not  The Hulk , for some strange reason) more than I know many people did. It had the handicap of a CGI-created main character to overcome, which turned out to look better that I thought it would, but still, it's hard to invest yourself in a bunch of 1s and 0s on the movie screen. And I think it made a mistake in not having the Hulk speak; that left him as a personality-less destruction machine. The destruction was pretty  awesome , true, but I'd have liked to hear him say "Hulk smash" at least once. I mean, throw me a frickin' bone. And where's Rick Jones?  But I liked Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, I  love  Jennifer Connelly in  anything , and I appreciated both the slower, more subtle character moments as well as the inventive visual "comic book" style of the movie. I liked that the film spent time developing Banner's repressed psychological scars, which helped to create the Hulk persona bottled up inside him -- and that it showed Banner  enjoys  releasing that rage. And that tank fight: come on, that was kick-ass.  Right now, though, I'm having a tough time liking the Hulk. Because all I've got to go by is the comic book, by current writer Bruce Jones... and the comic  sucks . I flat-out hate it. For one thing, it suffers from Marvel-itis, in which a two-issue story is painfully stretched out to a trade paperback-friendly five or six issues. For another, it's all  X-Files -type conspiracies and mysterious covert agencies and that's all fine and good in the  beginning , but eventually you have to start coming up with some resolutions to those mysteries, and, like  The X-Files , for what few questions it  did  supply (before I finally dropped the book), it fell far short of the expectations it had created. And worst of all, a capital crime for an Incredible Hulk comic:  it doesn't feature the Incredible Hulk!!  Bruce Jones got the bright idea of using the Hulk in a very limited capacity only. Which meant that for a good number of issues, the Hulk only appeared in brief flashbacks, or by implication (gang of toughs threatens Banner, cut straight to gang of toughs with their asses kicked, with no sight of the Hulk in between), if he even appeared  at all . That might be fine once or twice, as a change of pace, but when I buy a Hulk comic, I want to see the goddam Hulk. I don't buy a Superman comic for 22 pages of Clark Kent reading internet jokes from his mom at work, and if I wanted 22 pages of Bruce Banner, then I'd buy a goddam comic called  Bruce Banner ,  not  one called  The Incredible Goddam Hulk !!  But. It appears Jones is out. He's signed an exclusive deal with DC, which means his run on the Hulk will soon be over. And good riddance. The buzz in the fan world is that Peter David is a possible candidate to take over from him, which couldn't make me happier. Problem is, according to his website, nobody's offered David the job yet (although if anybody has a brain at Marvel -- which you may debate amongst yourselves -- they will soon), and what's more, he speculates that the Hulk might not even continue in an ongoing series. Which would be terrible. Why a bevy of A-list writers aren't clamoring for this gig is beyond me. Peter David, among others, has shown that the Hulk can be so much more than a one-note "Hulk smash" character. Hell, at this point, returning the Hulk to all "Hulk smash" all the time would be a daring new direction in itself.  Bottom line is, Marvel had better get  someone  up to the task of helming a monthly Hulk comic, and they had better do it fast. He's one of their most popular, interesting, challenging creations ever, and I want to see someone who can bring the comic back up to a consistently entertaining level. Forget all this men-in-black crap.  Or Hulk will smash.

      I just finished watching the DVD of  urlLink  The Butterfly Effect   and... wow.  That  was interesting. I mean, don't get me wrong: it's a train wreck. It is definitely a failure. But it fails in such uniquely spectacular and fascinating ways, that I can't help but admire it a little.  First things first: I'll admit, Ashton Kutcher isn't as bad as I thought he'd be. I actually  like  Kutcher on  That '70s Show . I've never been an Ashton basher. (Except for that  Punk'd  crap he does on MTV. That is some seriously lame shit.) I think he can be very funny. I just didn't think he'd be able to pull off a dramatic role. And... he doesn't, exactly, but like I said, he's not as bad as I thought.  Where the film goes wrong, and keeps going wrong, over and over again, is in the relentlessly brutal torture of its characters. The plot, as you know, is a remake of the  urlLink "Stupid bug! You go squish now!"  episode of  The Simpsons ... well, not really, but it might as well be. Kutcher, like Homer, finds a way to travel into the past, but every change he makes in the hopes of making the future better actually makes it exponentially worse. Ned Flanders never places the Earth under his totalitarian rule, but if the movie had been ten minutes longer, he might very well have.  Here are the horrible things that happen to Kutcher's character Evan  before  he even goes back in time. (Spoilers, natch.) Evan suffers from a series of blackouts. His father has been locked away in a loony bin. The girl he loves (Kayley) is forced to perform sexual acts with him on camera by Kayley's alcoholic father -- when they're only  seven years old . (Eric Stoltz gives an amazingly creepy performance as the father, by the way.) The girl's brother Tommy watches them, and it turns him into a psychopath. Evan finally gets to meet his dad -- who then tries to murder him. Evan, Kayley, Tommy, and Evan's best friend Lenny accidentally blow up a woman and her baby girl. Yes, I said  blow up . Tommy puts Evan's dog in a sack and  sets it on fire . Lenny is driven into near-catatonia by these events. Evan's mother moves them out of town, leaving Kayley to fend for herself against her lunatic father and brother. And, to top it all off, when Evan seeks out Kayley again after a seven-year absence, he drives her to commit suicide.  Yeah, and that's just an  appetizer . Perhaps you begin to see how comically over the top this film is determined to go.  Evan discovers that by reading the journals he kept growing up, he can project himself back in time -- it turns out the blackouts were during periods of time travel. If he concentrates on a journal entry concerning one of those blackouts, he goes back into his body at that time, and is then able to influence the events that happened  during  his blackouts. (Many more spoilers ahead.) First time he tries to do so, it seems everything is just peachy dandy. He's turned into a frat boy douchebag for some reason, but he and Kayley are happily in love. Then Tommy shows up and tries to kill Evan, but Evan kills him instead. Cut to: the slammer! Evan's doing hard time for murder. And for murder, you don't go to white collar resort prison. You go to  urlLink federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison . Yes, that's right, on his first night in the joint, Evan gets introduced to the wonders of prison rape. Ouchie.  Well, Evan thinks he can fix everything, and he really really means it, this time for sure. He goes back in time again, and tries to keep Tommy from killing his dog, but through a  whimsical  miscommunication, he accidentally convinces Lenny to murder Tommy. Oopsie! Back in the future, Lenny is strapped to a bed in the loony bin, and Kayley is a scar-faced junkie whore. Let's try that again: Evan goes back in time to keep the woman and her baby daughter from getting blown up, and he's successful! Back in the future, everyone is happy and healthy -- even Tommy has turned to the Lord and changed his evil ways. Small hitch: the explosion blew off Evan's arms. Dagnabbit! Pesky time travel! Evan sees how much better off everyone else is, though, and decides to take one for the team and stay with this timeline. Then he finds out his mother is dying of cancer. To the  urlLink Wayback Machine ! This time Evan figures he'll get rid of the explosive before it can ever be used. Funny thing, though, little monkey wrench in the plan: he accidentally blows up Kayley instead. Butterfingers!  This time, back in the future, Evan's in the loony bin himself. He's got one chance left to put everything back in order, and he does so by going back to when he and Kayley first met, and telling her he will  kill  her if she ever speaks to him again. Nice and subtle, there, chief. But it works! Evan returns to the future, and by never having known him, Kayley and Tommy turn out just fine. It's a wonderful life!  The DVD has an extra little kick in the ass that I  love . It ratchets up this unrelenting torture-fest into whole new levels of agony. There's the theatrical ending -- in which, eight years further down the line, Evan and Kayley pass each other on the street, but keep on going. There are two alternate takes of that scene -- one in which Evan turns to follow Kayley, and one in which Kayley and Evan stop and have a sweet little meeting. But then there's the  director's cut . Oh ho ho, the  director's cut  goes an entirely different and jaw-droppingly sadistic route. On Evan's last trip to the past, instead of going back to his first meeting with Kayley, he goes all the way back to his  birth . At the hospital, while still in his mother's womb, he gains his entire lifetime of knowledge. And he decides his best option is to (I have to italicize  and  boldface this)   strangle himself to death with his own umbilical cord  . I  swear on my life  that I am  not  making this up. The best option for everyone else in his life to have a happy ending is for him to commit  prenatal suicide . Gee, I wonder why the preview audiences didn't embrace  that  ending?  It's an awful movie, but it's so  original  in its awfulness. Each new horrible wrinkle in time leaves you agog in disbelief. "He's got no frickin'  arms??  Oh, come  on!! " It actually began reminding me of  Showgirls  a little bit as it went on, just a total misfire of  epic  proportions. The very bad things stop coming across as very bad, but rather very  funny . It's just  ludicrous  after a while. You just have to start laughing. And the movie (like  Showgirls ) is so  committed  to its badness. The fact that nobody who made this movie is  aware  of its badness makes it all the funnier. But the thing is, you can't look away! You just have to watch in gleeful awe at its audacious awfulness.  Would I recommend it? It depends on how much you like bad movies. If you made it through the entirety of both  House of the Dead  and  House of 1000 Corpses , or, for that matter, all of  Showgirls , then you might get some weird form of entertainment out of this film, like I did. If you want a good time travel movie, you're better off with  Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure  than this thing. And if you want a good Ashton Kutcher movie... well, good luck.

      I love comics. But I love comic  strips  even more. I'd gladly trade away Spider-Man for my daily fix of  Doonesbury . If it came down to Batman or  Dilbert , Batman would be out the door so fast his freakin' cowl would spin. If I had to choose between  Peanuts  and... well, no need to even finish that sentence. I would give up every comic ever for Charlie Brown and Snoopy.  What's got me thinking about this is one man's plan to renovate the comics page:  urlLink Scott Kurtz's post about comic strip syndication . Kurtz, as you may or may not know, is the creator of the fine and funny online comic strip  urlLink  PvP  . And in a few short paragraphs, he's put forth an argument for a comics page business model that's so radical, so revolutionary, so  crazy , that it just might destroy the comic strip syndicates, and completely change the world of comic strips.  I'm not going to go into his plan here; if you're interested, he explains his ideas much better than I could. He's got some sound logic and some grand ideas. But he also has some holes in his proposal; primarily, he totally fails to consider that, even if the  newspapers  want the syndicates to fall, many of the comic strip  creators  will not. Even with the promise of ownership of their own creations, as well as 100% of the profits from the books and assorted other merchandising the strips may spawn, many creators will still prefer the safety and security of the syndicates to a free market. For one thing, not every strip  has  a lot of merchandising, nor even the  possibility  of it; for every  Garfield , there are dozens of  Mr. Boffo s or  Drabble s or  One Big Happy s, for which there's barely a market for the books, let alone the kind of greeting card/birthday hat/plush toy merchandising that would generate enough money to make abandoning the syndicates worthwhile.  I said he fails to consider that fact, but perhaps he  has  considered it, and discarded it. For one thing, he is presupposing that the comics page is ready to self-destruct on its own, that newspapers are already close to rejecting the syndicates and shutting down their comics pages altogether. And it sounds like his plan is for a younger, newer crowd of strips to take over the comics page, to hell with what came before. And while it may be fine for  Get Fuzzy  to suddenly be in competition with hundreds of free (or much cheaper) new comic strips, and while it may also be fine for relics like  Dennis the Menace ,  The Family Circus ,  Marmaduke , and so forth to be permanently retired, what about those established but deserving strips that suddenly find themselves unable to compete in such a market?  For Better or For Worse  might be a good example here. I think it's still a decent strip, though clearly of another generation. Would it suddenly be lost in the shuffle?  All this is idle speculation, obviously; it may even sound like I'm against Kurtz, but I'm not. The truth is, it's more than likely that Kurtz won't change anything with his plan, and even if he does, it will be in slow and minute increments. But I admire him for proposing such an ambitious plan. And I'm hoping that if he (and hopefully other online cartoonists) and the newspapers successfully take a stand against the stranglehold the syndicates have on the comics page, that one of my fondest dreams may at long last be realized:   Cathy  will finally die.

      A nagging question about last week's Democratic Convention coverage by  The Daily Show  was just cleared up for me on Dana Steven's  urlLink Surfergirl  TV blog (which I have under my links, yet I had to be made aware of the post by a link on  urlLink Mark Evanier's blog ... the blog world, it's all so incestuous, isn't it? Oh, man, I dread the Google searches that word is gonna net me. I've already gotten a hit from "women+and+dog+fantasies". Why, I don't know. But I digress).  My nagging question was, why didn't Ted Koppel show up for a scheduled interview on Thursday's  Daily Show ? Stewart didn't even mention Koppel's absence, which I thought was weird. Dana Stevens appears to have the answer: on Wednesday, Koppel spoke to Stewart on  Nightline . And it appears Koppel does not much care for Stewart or  The Daily Show . I wish I had seen that segment; it sounds like Koppel went off on Stewart, although it also sounds like Stewart held his own, and perhaps was even more gracious than Koppel deserved.  That's a shame, because I have a tremendous respect for Koppel, but he really doesn't get it. People aren't watching  The Daily Show  as a news source, as he accused Stewart, they're watching it (or at least I am) to get an alternate spin on the news. Stewart's coverage of the coverage of Al Sharpton's speech at the convention is a good example. Several media outlets treated the speech dismissively, writing Sharpton off as little more than a crank, with nothing of significance to say, with Chris Matthews for one actually interrupting the coverage of the speech because he felt it lacked importance. Stewart and  The Daily Show , meanwhile, showed an impassioned Sharpton enthralling and galvanizing the convention with his words.  Is  The Daily Show 's take more reliable? Not necessarily -- but it is a  different  take, a take that can see past the old conventional wisdom of Sharpton as no more than a jogging suit-clad loudmouth, a take not bound by network sensibilities or political filtering. Even if you don't like Stewart's take (and certainly he -- and the show -- are more biased toward the left than not), you have to admit he often presents a candid, bullshit-free side to the news which other, "real" news outlets should be ashamed for neglecting.

      This weekend saw the long-anticipated return of two of my favorite cartoons:  urlLink  Teen Titans   and  Justice League , now retooled as  urlLink  Justice League Unlimited  .   Teen Titans  finally resolved the Terra cliffhanger (I don't think it was  intended  as a "cliffhanger", but when you take four months off between episodes, that's what you get) by having her betray the team on Slade's behalf. I have to say, after all that work to put Terra inside the Teen Titans headquarters, Slade's grand plan was pretty stupid. Send in a bunch of robots? The ones the Titans destroy every single time?  That's  your plan? I mean, it led to some  excellent  fight scenes, but that's about it. If the plan was to kill the Titans, why were the robots trying to install some of Slade's machinery in the tower? If the plan was to install that machinery, why didn't he just have Terra do it? It's just a nonsensical plan, a waste of resources and an unnecessary exposure of his mole in their organization. And what is Terra's reason for working for Slade? She's not  bad , and Slade didn't appear to have her under any kind of physical or mental control. Why does she help him hurt her friends? And why does Beast Boy let Slade go at the end, when it looks like his bear-form was kicking the crap out of him?  So, yeah, some minor questions leaving me a little dissatisfied with this episode. But I'm glad to see the show back, and I see that the next two episodes also feature Terra, so maybe some of my questions will actually be answered.   Justice League Unlimited  also left me wanting. The reveal of the satellite full of heroes at the very beginning was pretty cool, but I'm afraid all those extra characters are going to crowd out some of the original seven (six, now -- it looks like Hawkgirl is gone for good, which is a shame. At least she's not  forgotten ; best scene in this episode was Green Lantern waking up yelling "Shayera!" I hope she returns at some point this season. And speaking of GL: nice facial hair. As Scott at  urlLink Polite Dissent  noted: it's the Avery Brooks makeover). Many of the original episodes left out one or more of the headliners, and that was when they only had seven total to draw from. Now there's  dozens . It looks like Martian Manhunter will be left out of the main action every episode, coordinating things from the satellite, which I don't like. And I don't think Flash or Wonder Woman had a single line this episode, which, considering this was the season premiere and all, is a bad sign of things to come.  I don't like the new title sequence: it seemed like they couldn't show enough of Supergirl. There are, like, fifty other superheroes you could show in the credits, why concentrate on her? Maybe the credits will change each week, showcasing whichever characters are in that week's episode. That'd be nice.  I liked Green Arrow (although I don't care for his voice -- Kin Shriner, some soap opera guy I've never heard of. His voice is too wimpy), and they made sure to supply a fan-favorite moment right at the beginning. The second I saw him, I started chanting, "Boxing glove arrow, boxing glove arrow," and they did not fail to deliver. Sweet! His reluctance to join the team was believable, and his reason for staying was another fan-favorite moment (Black Canary!), but the chemistry the writers seemed to want to build between him and Green Lantern never really worked. And the resolution to the nuclear menace was pretty lame:  urlLink "It's an inanimate carbon rod!"  Would a twelve-inch chunk of carbon really shut down a fifty-foot tall atomic robot? And if so: who cares? It just  looks  dumb.  A note on the music: please make it stop. It's  horrible . That twangy guitar doesn't fit with this show at all (unless Lobo makes an appearance). Get the old music back, stat.  So, yeah, another disappointment for me. There appears to be a lot of promise in this show, especially if they face some galactic-level menace and have to use  everyone  at once, but I was just fine with the smaller team. I think they had  plenty  more stories to tell, with room to fit in the  occasional  guest-star superhero. I fear the real fun of this show -- and its focus -- might get lost in the crowd.

      I wasn't expecting much from a movie called  urlLink  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle  , and that's basically what I got. Maybe I should've expected even less. But how could I? It's a stoner comedy by the guy who directed  Dude, Where's My Car? * That bar is not set very high. (Heh, I said "high".)  It's funny enough, with a few good extended laughs, but for some reason I had built myself up into thinking this would be some kind of comedy classic I needed to see in the theater. Partly due to a lot of hype on various blogs and review sites, partly from Ebert & Roeper giving it two thumbs up (I figured, if  they  recommend a stoner comedy, it must be very funny indeed). And it's just not  that  good.  Again, I'm aware that I'm talking about  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle  here. And I'm aware that it seems a little silly to claim disappointment in a movie with that title. Still, I did expect more.  The two leads are definitely very funny people, especially John Cho as Harold. He's been good in a lot of different things, and he's good here. And the movie has a decent amount of comedy in it, as well as some excellent cameo appearances, including Fred Willard as an admissions officer at a medical school, Jamie Kennedy as a strange man in the forest, Ryan Reynolds as a male nurse, and, best of all, Neil Patrick Harris as himself. You can't resist laughing when Doogie Howser tells Harold and Kumar, "I'm tripping my balls off," or, "I left some love stains in the back seat." You just can't. Well, maybe  you  can, I don't know you very well. But  I  couldn't.  I think one of the problems I had with this movie may have come from the audience I saw it with. There were very few people to begin with, and the ones who were there were often uncomfortably silent while I was laughing, which made me a little self-conscious, and less willing to laugh. Not that the audience hated the movie, or never laughed; they just were fairly reserved for a raunchy, dopey, drug-related comedy like this one.  I still laughed a  lot , though. It's not  Anchorman  funny, but it's still a good deal funnier than it has any right to be, and it actually makes a few clever observations about how Asians are perceived, and expected to behave, in America. It's a definite DVD rental.    *One of my favorite jokes ever from  The Daily Show  was when Jon Stewart claimed the sequel would be named,  Oh, There It Is .

       urlLink  Mr. 3000  : What struck me most about the trailer for this Bernie Mac baseball "comedy" was not how stunningly unfunny it looks to be, nor what a step down this is career-wise for Angela Bassett, but that it's stolen a gimmick directly from the Bad News Bears. Bernie Mac, at first base, has concealed the ball in his glove, and when the baserunner takes a big leadoff, Bernie tags him out. That is a  direct steal  from one of the Bad News Bears films (I think it was  urlLink  The Bad News Bears Go to Japan  , but it's been a while.) That's just  sad . Also, any movie that still thinks it's funny to make Tom Arnold/Roseanne jokes should be taken behind the barn and shot like Old Yeller.   urlLink  Exorcist: The Beginning  : This one's tough to judge. The original  Exorcist  is an enduring horror classic, but its two sequels were for shit. And this new prequel has quite a troubled history: Renny Harlin is the  third  director attached to the film; John Frankenheimer quit the film a month before his death, and Paul Schrader was fired after  completing  the film -- the producers apparently hated his version, and hired Harlin to reshoot it with more action and violence. The DVD extras should be interesting -- they could just have one two-hour long deleted scene. Maybe I'll rent that DVD one day, but I think I'll be avoiding this in the theaters.   urlLink  Blade: Trinity  : This looks really dumb. But the first two Blade movies  also  looked really dumb, and they were both highly entertaining. This movie has the added bonus of seeing goofball Ryan Reynolds (of  Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place ) and whiny little powderpuff Jessica Biel act like super-tough vampire hunters, which is just inherently funny to me. Plus: Parker Posey as a vampire. Nuff said. I'm there. And special note for  urlLink Ian : Patton Oswalt's in this thing. Could it get any better??   urlLink  Nicotina  : This film is trying to capitalize on the buzz from every Latin indie film of the past five years. From the producers of  Amores Perros ! With one of the actors from  Y Tu Mam&#225; Tambi&#233;n ! And if you squint a little, it kind of looks like  City of God ! According to IMDb, though, unlike those films, this is supposed to be a comedy, which I didn't really get from the trailer. Looked like just another crime film to me. Not interested.   urlLink  A Dirty Shame  : This could be great, or it could be a train wreck -- and considering it's John Waters directing, it might be both. Waters is returning to his perverted beginnings as a filmmaker in a  big  way with this NC-17 rated film. I was shocked by the stuff they showed in the  trailer , which only  hints  at the deeply twisted depravity waiting in the real thing. I can't  wait . No matter what, I am seeing this film. On a sidenote: Selma Blair is one of the stars. She also was in  urlLink  Storytelling  . Now, I don't know if she's the  only  actress ever to appear in  two  NC-17 films, but if she's not, I bet you could count them all on the fingers of one hand. I just find that interesting.
