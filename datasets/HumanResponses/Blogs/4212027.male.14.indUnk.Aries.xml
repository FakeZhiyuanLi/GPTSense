      I never sang my songs, On the stage, on my own I never said my words, Wishing they would be heard, I saw you smiling at me was it real? Or just my fantasy? You’d always be there in the corner of this tiny little bar.  My last night here for you, Same old songs just once more, My last night here with you? Maybe yes, maybe no. I kinda liked it your way, How u shyly placed your eyes on me, Did You ever know that I had mine on you?  *Darling so there you are, With that look on your face, As if you’re never hurt, As if you’re never down, Shall I be the one for you? Who pinches you softly but sure, If frown is shown then, I will know that you are no dreamer.  So let me come to you, Close as I wanna be, Close enough for me, To feel your heart beating fast, And stay there as I whisper, How I love your peaceful eyes on me, Did you ever know? That I had mine on you.  Darling so share with me, Your love if you have enough, Or tears if you’re holding back, Or pain if that’s what it is, How can I let you know? I’m more than the dress and a voice, Just reach me out then, You will know that you are not dreaming.  *Darling so there you are, With that look on your face, As if you’re never hurt, As if you’re never down, Shall I be the one for you? Who pinches you softly but sure, If frown is shown then, I will know that you are no dreamer.

      Alone for a while, I’ve been searching through the dark. For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart. To weave while picking up the pieces that remain. Melodies of life love’s lost refrain.  Our paths they die cross though I can not say just why. We met, we laughed, we held on fast and then we said good bye. And who will hear the echoes of stories never told. Let them ring out loud till they unfold.  In my dearest memories . I see you reaching out to me. Now you’re goneI still believe that you can call on my name.  A voice from the past joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes on and onMelodies of life . To the sky beyond the flying birds. Forever and beyond.  So far and away, see the bird as it flies by, Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky. I've laid my memories and dreams upon those wings. Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings.  In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me? Was it fate that brought us closer and now leaves me behind?  A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life,To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and on.  A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life,To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and on.
