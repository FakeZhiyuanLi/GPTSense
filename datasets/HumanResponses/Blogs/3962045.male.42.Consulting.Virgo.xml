      "Although you currently have a possition in an organization, in order to justify that possition you must demonstrate your value to the company on a daily basis. As a professional or knowledge worker, freeing yourself from an unhealthy dependence on the corporation and feeling, thinking, and acting like a Free Agent increase your value to your organization and in the marketplace." -- Free Agent (Published in 1997 by Jossey-Bass)

      I bumped into my old client this morning. We used to do some consulting work for his agency, a statutory board. He seems well and quite happy. But he also told me that the whole government body is freezing and cutting down on head count, 3% reduction per year, or something like that. I wonder what would happen to all those civil service people? They can't be possibly go to private sector and try to make a living, can they? Well, they can try, but based on my past consulting experience with them, I doubt they can cut it. Probably only the top 10%-15% of the staff could make it in the private sector. As for the rest of 85%, well... come on boys come to private sector and we'll teach you a good lesson! In private sector we do real work, and not just paper work! We talk about real money here, not paper or budgetary money. We talk about real bottom line here, not just imaginery targets, numbers and statistics. So come onboard, and learn to swim while in the deep pool! No life guard here. Welcome to real life!

      Yesterday, when I was having tea in a nearby mall, I overheard a conversation between a would-be supervisor and a newly hired. The supervisor was telling the newly hired how she could come in tomorrow morning, by which doors, who to look for, and the dress code too. The sound and feeling were all very familiar to me. It's the feeling of starting a new job in a new place. It just reminded me how I haven't got the feeling for a very long time. Perhaps I have stayed in my current job for a little bit too long. Perhaps I've become more lazy and less daring as the years go by. Perhaps I have more commitment and family responsibilities now compared to my younger days. Perhaps the economic is still not recovered yet, and no good jobs available out there. Perhaps... perhaps.

      Motivation is a key for people to be productive. I notice in my colleagues, who are demotivated, that they don't actually putting much effort to get the work done. In fact, they tend to operate in a fire-fighting mode -- attending to the problem that create biggest fire. Not a very effective way of prioritising. But lately I too found myself to operate in this manner. I guess that would come a point where all of us the average employees would just give up on the management and just "switch off" and just do whatever we're told to do, without any additional initiative to make it better. What's the point? It seems like thinking and initiatives are rewarded only with criticism and more work, without the accompanying credits. Yes, there's such thing as self motivation, but this commodity is hard to come by these days.

      We are knowledge worker, we create value and make things happen. That's what our Managing Director told us at the recent Staff Communication Conference. He told us that with competing pressure from India and China, we have to reinvent ourselves. Project Management and implementation used to be our forte. He told us that we have to move away from that and move up to the higher level of value chain. Nice talk. Feel good motherhood statements, of course.  We are about 200 strong consulting companies. Divided into many groups managed by Engagement Managers, who will have a number of Account Managers under him/her, depending how big the client is. So when come the EM and AM level, all those feel-good motherhood statements are fitting for trash bin only! We are hired for our skills, knowledge and experience. But the EM and AMs give us assignment and manage us as if we are factory workers. So why pay the premium of graduates with experience if you're not going to use what you're paying for? if it's just a pair of hands and legs that you need, you'll be better of hiring O-level or A-level staff. Even those with Diploma are over qualified. So is it any wonder if our clients are beginning to question our value? Are we worth what they are paying for? Would you hire graduate with 5-year experience to arrange for meetings and write minutes? We do!  So our big-shot Mr. MD up there, he certainly does not have any clue of what's happening at the ground level. Poor guy! He only know that our clients are not happy and not satisfied, but he has no clue why, and what more could we do to make them happy. Perhaps, it's not what more could we do, but rather what could we do and don't do that would deliver the value that they are really paying for. A deliverables that worth more than a fee that we charged them.

      My pointy-haired boss was upset over the Maintenance Plan document that we updating late. So what's so important about this document that none of us make use of it for the whole year? Only to satisfy ISO-9000 requirement! Is this quality? Is this the quality that ISO-9000 was suppose to help us achieve? I feel like this ISO-9000 stuff is just another legalised world-wide scam, generating tones of money for the otherwise unemployed QA auditors. Because I really don't see how our customers would benefit from this Maintenance Plan that we draft on our own, then we approve it ourselves, and keep it in the folder for the whole year long. Once in a while when we're lucky to be picked for QA audit then the auditor might ask for it. Otherwise, it would be there collecting dust until end of the year, and then we stamp it "OBSOLETE". And start with another new document. Now tell me that this is quality work and not wasting time.

      Blogger's new text editor doesn't seem to work with Linux browsers. I tried with Mozilla 1.2 and Konqueror browser, both don't work. I can't even type anything. I have to use the Edit HTML mode, instead.   I'm never a Linux fan. In fact, I've always been Windows fan (and seems would continue to be so). It's my classmate who insist to install Linux on my PC, so that I can try this "wonderful" system.  Seems like Microsoft will continue its reign in desktops arena for some distance future -- at least their product works, for me. Yes, I just want to get my work done, and not spending 80% of the time fighting the Operating System in the process.

      I just updated our "Maintenance Plan" for this year. Yes, I know it's July now :-)  It's so long overdued. But the truth is, if there's no internal quality audit coming up next month, I don't think anyone would even borther to update the document. Why should we spend precious resource -- time -- on a piece of document that none would refer to for the rest of the year? So much for quality, huh?!

      We did some major cleaning in our apartment this weekend. Kitchen is the most difficult to clean, with all the oil-mixed dust on top of the cabinet, it's really difficult to get them off. Fortunately, we have Cif, which is very good to get stubborn stain to come out. Our kitchen is very clean now :-)  Sunday is almost gone, and so does the weekend. I've already bought two tickets for I,Robot this evening 6:30pm show. I'm looking forward to it. The last good movie I missed was The Day After Tomorrow. I guess I've to wait for the CD to be released. It's not the same as watching in cinema, but it's better than not watching it at all.

      These are the signs that can be useful to tell:-   1.&nbsp;Confronting&nbsp;the boss openly in the meeting, especially when there are people from other department in the meeting too.   2. Seem to willingly accept any additional workload without much complaint. I'm not talking above being positive attitude, but accepting workload even beyond 100%.   3. Doesn't bother to clarify the scope of roles and responsibility with other members of the projects.   4. Unusually easy going. Anything also can.

      At the beginning of a project, it is important that we clear the roles and responsibilities of everyone. The tendency is to leave things in grey area, and adopt casual approach. But such approach would lead to a lot of conflict and misunderstanding in the later stages. Especially when manpower resources are hard pressed, the more thorough and formalised the roles and responsibilities are to be defined.   That's what I learn recently, when we are facing with headcount freeze (and even cut!). We used to tolerate each others, you do less, I do a little more, it's alright. But that only possible when we have enough capacity to make that extra concession -- give and take, so call. But when we all are stretched beyond 100%, we simply don't have the capacity to make such concession. Things getting more formalised now. It has to be clear whether it's my part of the job or yours. It's not that I'm difficult person to work with, but it's simply the circumstantaces forces me to take that formal approach. And it turned out to be good thing, because after we all sat down and discuss our specific roles and responsibilities, things get cleared up really well. We are nice people&nbsp;by nature, it's only that the company policy that decided to load up above and beyond 100% that made us become less tolerant to one another. So no wonder in bad company nobody is happy.

      It's never a good idea to adopt concensus decision making style across the board. The organisation would end up like country club instead of company. Sure, there are times when building concensus amongst the staff are important, but we cannot afford to always go by concensus. The purpose of our existance as a company is to satisfy external needs, not to satisfy internal needs (make employees happy). Only country clubs exist to satisfy the needs of its members. &nbsp; That's what I observed happening in the circle of management in my department. Everything is decided based on concensus. As the result, every small matter is debated at great length and details. Nobody can agreed with anybody on any idea. Managers always (99% of the times) argue over even the smallest and most trivia matter. All of them are bulding turf and castle for themselves. Now I understand, why it's a good practice to move people about frequently -- especially those in management capacity. Even at the cost of disruption, it is still worth the effort.

      When there's increase of quantity of work, without the corresponding increase in manpower, the quality would inevitably decrease. Very simple concept, isn't it? But I'm very amaze how most management people in my company don't get this. No kidding! They load us with work as if we are bottomless pit! Ever wonders why Dilbert materials are selling like hot cakes? This is the reason, because it's rather comforting to know that not only my company is in Dilbert Ville, but many others too. Economy has not pickup yet. Otherwise, people would start migrating out from the Dilbert Ville -- the good and capable ones, I must say.

      When people are overworked they become unhappy. And when they become unhappy the chance of misunderstanding occurs becomes higher. I got into some misunderstanding email exchange with one of my colleagues this afternoon. Email was never a good medium to clear up misunderstanding to begin with. But I was so overworked lately such that I don't have any spare tolerant level to try clear things up offline. So I just hit the reply button and fire away. Such thing probably would not happen if I was less agitated by the way our bosses load me and my other colleagues with work. And often it's trivial and clerical work that contribute none whatsoever to our professional career development. So if people are not happy with their working place, why bother to try to get along with the co-workers? If this continues at the end the organisation suffers, because all these will eventually affect our customer service.

      Are we really the most valuable resource of the organization? I would like to think so. My bosses said so. But the actual actions taken by the very same people who proclaimed that people are most important asset of the organization are contradicting that very message! My colleague has been waiting to be deployed to another project for months. And nothing happen yet. Not because there's no other projects that need him, but it's because our bosses here are not ready to release him without securing a replacement first. So he feels very much at lost and in limbo now -- not very certain how his career would turn out in the next 6 months (and that's how long he could potentially need to wait). In the mean time, "they" just park him here to take care of some mundane tasks, without important responsibilities (because they afraid that he could be gone or redeployed anytime). I would like to think that there got to be more control that we have over our career. It should not be like this. Our life and career at the hand of our bosses (people who said they care, but really aren't at all!). But the sad thing is, with the current state of economy, there are not many option out there. What can I say, it's an employer's market now. You know what's more frustating? I could be next in line in the same situation, because my posting to the current project is about to expire (or reach the maximum allowed deployment time). And our HR would start to kick a big fuzz to have me redeployed, and our bosses would start to worry about finding out suitable replacement, and... and... the whole stupid things will repeat again. All in the name our keeping fresh idea, able to think out of the box, breakout from comfort zone, etc. etc. etc. but at the end of the day, they really are messing people life.

      He just resend his email annoucement :-) Hmm... I wonder if he figured out the bad attachment himself or someone actually borther to open these things.

      Sometimes attachments in Lotus Notes is strange. For any reason, the Word icon is attached instead of the actual Word document. So when I try to click on the attachment, it was recognised as picture instead of attachment. One of my colleagues send out mass email announcement with Word documents attached. But one of the attachments are icon instead of the documents. Should I tell him? Nah... probably not. He probably won't appreciate it. And he probably thought I was too free to even borther to try to open the attachments, as if reading the email itself is not time consuming enough.

      When you think of it, in the corporate world, there's always a bigger dog out there. Once I was working with my pointy-haired manager. He's always licking his boss' *you know what*. But then I really even his boss is also licking someone else's *you know what*, so that's the truth about corporate world. There's always a bigger dog around. So what's the moral of this story?  It's forget about who your boss is trying to please. Just concentrate on your own work, and let your boss do the licking  job :-)  afterall, we the real contributor, the knowledge worker, the professional, are not defined by our bosses. We can stand on our own's feet, based on our own achievement. It's those who don't have any real skill that need to do licking.
