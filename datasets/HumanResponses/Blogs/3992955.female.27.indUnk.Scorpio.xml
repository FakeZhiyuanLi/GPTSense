      Hey all...Yeaaaah Vegas was fun (and I need a whole other post for those details). I swear I feel like I'm still getting over the jet-lag, the time change, the drinkies ;) It was what Vegas should be. Lots of fun.  My eye doctor appointment&nbsp;on Weds&nbsp;was weird. Apparently my eyes have sort of switched. My left eye used to be worse and now it's gotten stronger and my right eye is weaker. WEIRD! I ordered some new glasses and the Dr. said if my distance vision doesn't feel right I can come in and get another exam and the new glasses tweaked.  It's been quiet here this week.&nbsp; I have to go see a speaker at an event with an organization with work with from 11-12:15.&nbsp; This duder better be good because I'm taking my lunch break to hear him.  Since I've been so good on South Beach I'm rewarded myself yesterday&nbsp;and get some Chinese. A couple weeks ago as you all know D got this wild hair up his ass to do the South Beach Diet --    My friend Amy summed it up best:   Darin said: Melissa, I really want to go on South Beach and lose weight before my high school reunion.   Translation:  Melissa, we can go on South Beach so I can lose weight before the reunion but you have to do all the shopping and cooking. I'll just sit on the couch and you can hand me the food over.  Ummm yeah.Sure, I don't MIND cooking because I'm good at it. I'm not modest about it. I kick ass in the kitchen. My dad still wants me to go to culinary school, we'll see if that happens. But at the SAME time I really like to be able to come home and have someone wait on ME!  Anywhoo on this buggery diet I've lost about 10 pounds-- I think, I hate scales and really don't go by them. I do know that the skirt I'm wearing today is way too big, even with a belt on. My mom is all "you don't need to lose that weight, cheat on that diet when you can" so&nbsp;yesterday was&nbsp; a cheat day. ;) I'm had rice!&nbsp; I had breading on chicken! Mmmmmmmm Peking Chicken!   Today I'm also indulging by having a White Chocolate Mocha.  I'm a rebel.&nbsp; ;)  Mel

      I already have a blog of sorts at livejournal.com, but I started this so that I can post along with Jeff and Stacey.  Peer pressure!  ;)  Mel
