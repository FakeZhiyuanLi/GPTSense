      My boss threw a nice party for me last night to celebrate my arrival in the Czech Republic.  Lord, the Czech people know how to drink!  I warn any tee-totalers out there that "I don't drink" is not understood here.  Drinking is a way of being friendly, and I want to be friendly, so I ended up drinking three glasses of wine and some vodka.  What a strange feeling--like wanting to sleep, laugh, and have sex at the same time--which is physically impossible, I think.  I was out until 3 in the morning and I had to work at 8.  Ahhh, I'm amazed I made it out of bed....

      Hey everyone,  It looks like my internet access won't be that great afterall.  I'm sharing a computer with one of the employees at Hopr, the company where I work.  Every time I ask to check email, etc., I feel like I'm imposing.  So my posts may be few and far between and lack the profundity you've all come to expect by knowing me in person.  Just kidding.  Coming to the Czech Republic has clearly gone to my head :o)  Anyway, my thought for the day is that I've aged half a day by coming here.  That's how I look at it anyway.  My watch has a digital part and an anolog part.  I keep the digital on Salt Lake time and the anolog on Czech time.  Right now it's 10 o'clock in CZ and 2 in the morning in SLC.  So I'm 8 hours older than I would be if I were in SLC.  Weird....  I had a great weekend.  I visited a medival castle here in Zabreh.  It was castle-like, everything a castle should be, motes, big halls, suits of armour, the whole she-bang. Also, the little girl I'm teaching English to had her 5th birthday.  Let me tell you, it ain't easy teaching a child who doesn't speak your language--lots of signing and saying "Linda, come, chocolate.  Linda sit, chocolate."  My one means of getting control is chocolate bribery.  Along that line, I'm soliciting babysitting/teaching advice at suspendeddisbelief@hotmail.com I haven't yet added a comments section--still working on it.  Anyhow, I'll sign off now.  I hope you're all happy and healthy.  I miss everyone.

      I've arrived in the Czech Republic safe and sound after about 13 hours of flight time.  The whole process took about 26 hours all together.  I'm a little rushed, but I'll make a few notes of my prgress:    1. No signs of jet lag so far.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my body clock will sort itself out with minimal discomfort to me.  2. My boss is a nice, sophisticated lady who speaks English quite well.  We drove 3 hours from Prague to Zabreh and listened to Cher and Jennifer Lopez the whole way, then we stopped at McDonald's for dinner.     God save ubiquitous American pop culture.  3. I tried Kofola, Czech cola.  Tastes like a mix between root beer and Coke.   4. I'm still adjusting to people speaking Czech all around me.  Half the time I wonder if they're talking about me.  That's probably just paranoia, but you never know...  5. I've had to give up my vow to not eat beef.  When choosing between good manners and humanitarian ideals I have to go with manners.  That's all for now.  I'm trying to figure out how to install something for reader comments on my blog site.  Hopefully I'll have that up soon.                      Cheers,                        Kim

      Yippee!!  Kendra got the comments thing to work.  You're the best Kendra!  You're one smart gal.  I might have to take you to dinner twice.  Anyway, I'm learning to drive my boss's huge Mercedes station wagon through the tiny cobblestone streets here.  I hate driving in the U.S.  and here it's worse.  These streets were made for horses,  not cars.  Anyway, I pray everytime I get in the car that I don't do something stupid.  This car has about 50 buttons and I think I go into shock at the sight of them.  In other news, I ran into some Anti-American sentiment last night.  I was at dinner with my boss and her business partners from Austria.  My boss's sister was being friendly and asked the Austrian to talk about the differences between Austria and the U.S.  He said, "You can't even talk about any differences because America has no culture.  They have only McDonald's and Pizza Hut and all they care about is money."  I had just sat down at the table and he says this.  Needless to say, I was rather surprised at this bold rudeness, but I didn't say much back.  It would probably be a mistake to offend my boss's business partners.  However, this attack has made me think about America and my own feelings about my country.  America has many flaws, but I do love it.  More specifically, I love the concept of it.  America is a beautiful social experiment-a place where people can come from across the world and become anything they want through their own talents.  I know the reality is much different (racism, sexism, etc) but this is the concept of America.  My mother grew up in a Hell's Kitchen (NYC) hand laundry and graduated from college at 18 through her own efforts and talents.  This is the great American story.  I don't know of any other country where upward mobility is so valued (Canada maybe, I'm not sure).  When I started college, I considered every career possible--nothing was closed to me.  That is a wonderful thing.  So there is my patriotic rant about America.  I think I'll send it to an essay contest or something.  We can go into the phoniness of the American Dream (i.e., Great Gatsby, fabulous book by the way), that it's all about money, but to me it is about freedom, about making yourself the person you want to be.  I will also say that Americans must become more concerned about conditions in the rest of the world.  We must care more about the suffering in other countries and less about developing bullet-piercing armour, etc.  I think if we cared more about other countries, we wouldn't need the bullets.  Take Care,  Kim  P.S.  I'm on my way to Croatia.  No internet access, I believe.  You're on your own for a week, kids.

      Ok.  I think the comments link doesn't work.  I'm enlisting the help of a computer-savvy friend.  Thanks Kendra!  I'll take you to dinner anywhere you want to go.  :o)  We can even go for beef and potatos if that's what you want!  Check out Kendra's awesome blog at http://crylaughsnort.blogspot.com I started my own blog at Kendra's suggestion, so I must give credit where credit is due.  Nice quiet weekend here in the sunny Czech Republic.  I think it was about 80 degrees F, 30 degrees C.  I still haven't gotten the metric system down.  Which leads me to another small soapbox next to  my cute trains soapbox.  Why doesn't the U.S. go metric?  It's easier.  The rest of the world uses it.  Write to your senator today about the elegant mathematical beauty of the metric system.  Anyway, I'm leaving for a week in Croatia.  I can't wait.  I wonder if women walk around topless there.  If they do, should I do it?  Hmmm.  Maybe I should do it once to say I've done it.  I'll tell the grandkids about it.  "I was young once too.  Back in the eary 2000s I went topless in Croatia."  I'll say this as I wave my cane at them.  Ok, maybe I won't tell them that....might scare them.  Take Care Everyone,  Kim

      THINGS I MISS  1.  All of my friends and family (of course).  I live in a strange isolation here, always surrounded by people I can't talk to.  2.  Bookstores, libraries.  I am down to my last book and I've only been here a month.  I fear I will soon suffer serious book withdrawals.  I never realized how lucky I was in the States.  If I ever wanted a book, I just walked down to the library and got it.  Every Czech town I visit I look for books in English.  No luck yet.  3.  Mountains.  The Czech Republic has many beautiful wooded hills, but they're not my mountains--the mountains across the Great Salt Lake (I think the Wasatch).  Whenever I see those mountains, I know I'm home.  4.  Vietnamese, Indian, Tibetan, Chinese, and Japanese food.  Ohhh, for a good Masasman curry right now.  My mouth is watering.  I think it's potatoes and beef for lunch again today.  The first night I'm back in Salt Lake, I'm going to East West Connection, Cafe Trang, or House of Tibet.  Maybe all three, depends on how hungry I am. (In a side note, Czech chocolate is fabulous, so all is not lost).

      This weekend I took the train to Olomouc.  It cost about 2 dollars and took 30 minutes.  The U.S. definately needs more trains a) because they're cute and b) because they reduce air pollution.  Now is the time to contact your senator demanding cute trains for the U.S!  Ok, I'll get off my soap box now.  In Olomou, I went shopping for shirts, but didn't buy anything.  Here's another travel tip:  KIM'S TRAVEL TIP Try not to buy clothes or shoes in the Czech Republic because the selection is rather small and the prices aren't great.  I can't speak about Prague, but that was the situation I found in Olomouc.  Brno has a better selection with many U.S. stores like Benneton and Nike Town, but I'd still try to bring what you need from the states.    KIM'S TRAVEL TIP Also, stand warned that there is lyme disease in the Czech Republic.  The little girl I teach went on a field trip to the mountains and came back with a tick in her leg.  Her mother tried to get it out, but left a bit of it in her.  Pack some fine-tipped tweezers in case you find a tick on yourself.  I think there is a lyme disease vaccine, but I don't have it and I'm not sure about its success rate, etc.  Take Care.  That's all for now.  Kim

      A new look for my blogger site: Change is good.  I was getting tired of that orange.  I spent Wednesday in Vienna and all I can say is "Oh My God."  Vienna is absolutely fabulous.  I think I could live there for the rest of my life (ok, maybe not my entire llife, but at least five years).  Everyone I encountered in the city center spoke perfect English.  This creates a more touristy atmosphere, but is also so much easier than pointing to things in a phrase book.  For most of the day I was in the Albertine museum looking at the Albrect Duer exhibit.  He's famous for the fuzzy rabbit painting.  It looks like he painted every single hair on the hare.  Ha Ha.  Hair/hare.  I know that was bad, but I couldn't help it.  Anyway here's a travel tip--  KIM'S TRAVEL TIP: If you are traveling between the Czech Republic and Austria, buy everything in the Czech Republic.  As soon as you cross into Austria, the prices are three or four times higher.  I wrote a few days ago that musems in CZ cost about a dollar.  I paid nine dollars to get into the Albertine.  The price difference is due to Austria's membership in the EU.  Once CZ gets into the EU, prices will go UP, so come to CZ ASAP.  OK?  Sorry, I'm in a weird mood.  I went out drinking last night, and I think I'm still feeling it.  Oh, here's another travel tip.  KIM'S TRAVEL TIP:  There is a dish in CZ called "special meat."  This "special meat" is an expensive delicacy.  It's ground meat served on fried bread and has bits of onion and spices.  I just found out the "special meat" is raw beef from the cow's spine and a raw egg.  I am now totally paranoid that I have mad cow disease.  This meat is delicious, but don't have any if you don't want to eat raw food. Also, if anyone in CZ tells you "we will drink together some small spirits," that means vodka or whiskey.  Basically, you have to drink it, but stand warned.  Finally, I've been thinking about why U.S. cities are so ugly compared to European cities.  America is such a rich country, you'd think we could do better.  My boss said that Americans are uncultured and don't care about beauty.  I think that's certainly possible.  Take Care Everyone,  Kim

      A few interesting cultural differences:  *Entrance to museums and other historical sites in the Czech Republic costs about a dollar.  The average price is 25 crowns (29 crowns is a dollar).  I wish New York museums would take up this custom.  *On the other hand, good CDs of American music cost about 30 dollars.  *You also have to pay 5 crowns to use public bathrooms, shopping carts, and to get bags at grocery stores.  I think paying for bags is a great idea (a good way to reduce waste), but it's a bit irritating to pay when you just want to wash your hands at a mall.  *Gas stations provide free plastic gloves to use at the pump.  Interesting....  Also, my boss runs her car on diesel.  *Most shops are only open from 8 to noon on Saturday and are closed Sunday.

      Hey all,        I had a busy, fun week of sightseeing.  Czech cities are so beautiful, I don't know how I'll cope when I go back to the States.  On Wednesday, I went to Olomouc, a university town of 100,000.  It's filled with cobblestone streets, fountains, and gothic cathedrals.  I toured an old bishops' palace and had so Indian food, a nice change from dumplings and goulosh.  On Saturday, I hit Brno, the Czech Republic's second largest city.  It was remarkably clean.  I didn't see any litter on the ground anywhere.  My most interesting tour in Brno was of an old church crypt.  For about 50 cents, you can see thirty mummies from the 1700s in glass coffins.  Creepy, but good for meditation on the transience of life.  The worst part was that one of the mummies, an aristocratic lady, had been buried alive.  Her head was totally bent to the side and her hands were clenched.  What a nighmare.  I wonder if she thought she'd died and gone to hell.  Anyway, I won't go on.  It's too early in the week to be morbid.  This week I'm going to Vienna.  I'll keep you posted on the cool spots I find there.  Take care, everyone.

      Well, I had a quiet weekend.  A little chaos this morning--I normally take a bus to work at 7:39.  Well I arrived today and found no bus and no people.  I was a bit frantic because I have no other way to get to work and I have to teach a class at 9:00.  Finally, a few other people showed up at the bus stop and stood around expectantly.  I debated trying to talk to them in English and then decided to wait a little while and see what happens.  What do you know, a bus came at 8:00, which made no sense to me because I was told the buses come at 7:39 and again at 9:00.  I got on this bus and was afraid it would take me to some faraway city because no one had told me about it--like maybe this is the bus to Brno or something.  Lucily it went right to where I work.  I asked the secretary about the bus situation, and she said all the bus times change in September.  Doh!!  Just one of the little inconveniences you face when you don't know the language, and therefore can't read the bus schedule for yourself.  Well enough of my bitching.  Everything is fine otherwise.  I've walked a lot through Zabreh and am getting the lay of the land.  My boss is taking me on a day trip to a near-by city on Wednesday.  I'm so happy I get to travel with her on business trips.  Hopefully I'll hit Prague and Vienna soon.  Take care everybody.    :0)  ;)

      I spent a nice four days in Prague seeing the sites.  I stayed in Vinorhady, a part of town near Wenciles Square (terrible spelling).  An old man and his wife rented me a room in their home with my own bathroom and hot plate.  It was a nice setup and only five minutes from the center of town.  The toilet was one of those old-fashioned ones where you pull a chain attached to a box above you.  I think this is a superior toilet design because there is no water in the toilet bowl until you pull the chain--very environmentally conscious.  The other old-fashioned thing I love in CZ is that bookstores wrap your books in tissue paper, so you have this little parcel and you can open it up at home like a present. The highlight of my trip was walking through the gardens by Prague Castle with all of Prague spread below me.  It was like a dream--beautiful golden leaves on the trees and all the spires of the city rising up into the sun.  Tuesday was Czech Independence day, and the castle's main courtyard was filled with black BMWs from diplomats.  Each car had a driver waiting in the front and a little flag on the antenna showing what country they came from.  I wonder why diplomats always ride around in black cars, why not blue or red?  Maybe black is more dignified. There were two funny mishaps on my trip.  The first was that I forgot about daylight savings time, so I got on the wrong train coming back to Zabreh.  I ended up in Olomouc, 50 kilometers away and had to backtrack.  At least it only added one hour to my travel time. The other mishap happened at a liquor store.  I had gone in to buy a little bottle of absinth and have an encounter with the green fairy.  I think everyone has to drink absinth in Prague because it is the capital of Bohemia.  Anyway, I got up to the counter and asked for absinth and the lady started yelling at me in Czech.  I said "what?"  and she said "you--alcohol--no."  I yelled back, "I'm almost 23-years-old for Christ's sake," or something like that.  "No alcohol," she said again.  Then I pulled out my passport and proved that I was 22.  She became much more friendly and said something like "what do you want."  I said, "I'll buy it somewhere else."  By this time I was righteously pissed and walked straight out of the store.  I wasn't going to give money to someone who had yelled at me that way.  She didn't even just ask me for ID.  Anyway, it retrospect it's quite funny.  The legal age to buy alcohol here is 18.  She must have thought I'm 12 or something.  That's the funny thing about my looks.  Some people have thought that I'm 30 and others think I'm 15.  Strange, huh?  I guess I have the kind of face that easily morphs from one age to another.  In the end I bought the absinth somewhere else.  I haven't tried any yet.  Maybe I'll  have a sip on my birthday. In other news, I have moved into a hotel.  I have no TV or telephone, but other than that it's fine.  At least it's private and it's only for 6 weeks. I've also been thinking about whether I would ever settle abroad permanently.  I love Prague and feel like I could spend years there, but I think that if you can't speak the language, you're always a tourist.  You may be a tourist for a long, long time, but you're still a tourist.  Czech is a very hard language and I don't feel motivated to tackle it.  Also, I've already spent almost 100 dollars on calls to the US and I've only been here 2 months!  I think if I lived here for a long time I would go broke on international calls.

      I am pleased I created the impression that I am a hip nonchalant world traveler (at least according to Kendra).  I am really not hip or nonchalant and I'm barely a world traveler.  In reality, I eat cereal with my hands, have difficulty opening strange doors, and never read Kerouac until now.  I don't even know what a meta-narrative is.  Still, thanks for the nice thoughts, Kendra.  Also, here's one of the funniest things I've read in a while.  It is from a book called the Headway English course for Intermediate Students.  "In America you should eat your hamburger with both hands and as quickly as possible.  You shouldn't try to have a conversation until it is eaten."  So remember that the next time you're at McDonald's.    I've decided to start a movie review to go along with my book review of the tasty Pancake book (I agree it's a good name).  This week, I'd like to discuss my favorite Woody Allen movie, Broadway Danny Rose.  This movie beats out Annie Hall by a hair, mainly because the ending is fairly happy.  It also has Mia Farrow wearing some cool 70s sunglasses.  That is enough to make any movie great, I say.  There is a funny scene where Mia and Woody are tied up by thugs, and they have to wiggle against each other to get out of the ropes.  Ha ha ha!  Go rent it today.  Here's my favorite Woody Allen quote from the moive Zelig, "Zelig's father told him that the world was a meaningless nightmare of suffering.  His only advice was to collect string."

      Another interesting fact about the Czech Republic.  Ahoj means hello (casual) and chow means good-bye.  All day I feel like a pirate "Ahoj thar matey!" crossed with a Hollywood agent "Chow babes."  I do think ahoj and chow are more fun than hello and good-bye.

      So it looks like my boss is moving to Olomouc and I will have to find new accomodations.  I am not sure when exactly I'll move and where I will end up.  Right now I am trying to be very Zen about it and live in the present moment.  I will end up where I will end up.  My current digs are quite nice, so I am sad to see them go.  There is a big garden backing onto a field and an indoor swimming pool.  Don't feel jealous because I'll be leaving pretty soon.  Life is in constant flux, eh?

      So I am planning my next trip to Prague, trying to find another cheap hostel with a simpler door.  It has been very cold these last few days.  This morning there was frost on the ground.  I put the down lining into my coat for the first time this year.  I saw online that it was been 75 in SLC.  Sounds lovely. I have also developed an addiction to DVDs.  They are my only source of entertainment, and I would say I watch about three per week.  Selection is a bit limited, so I have watched things I wouldn't have considered in the US, such as the whole Mummy trilogy.  I quite liked the first Mummy movie.  It was campy in all the right ways with man-eating scarbs, etc.  The other two weren't as impressive--I can't really remember what happened in them. Also, I spoke to my sister, Lisa, (heyy Lisa!) last night and heard that Arnold Schwartzenager (spelling?) won the election in California.  I find this rather amusing.  I wonder if he'll run for president.  I am not sure he qualifies because he was born in Austria, but he would liven things up in the White House.  I don't think terrorists would mess with us anymore if President Arnold got on TV and said "We're going to kick some fundamentalist ass!"

      Hey All,  I spent yesterday in Vienna just walking through the city center.  I think I like Prague and Vienna equally.  They have different vibes.  Vienna is bigger and very flat.  All the old buildings are white with columns and statues.  The whole area is more spread out, so you don't get the wall of tourists that you find in Prague.  In Prague, many buildings are light yellow or light orange.  The river runs right past the center and there is beautiful hill where the castle sits.  The view is amazing.  All in all, I would say Vienna feels more cosmopolitan, glittery and new.  Prague is more romantic and atmospheric.  I am glad I live right between two fabulous cities.

      It has occured to me that trying to teach someone English is a great way to rediscover the language yourself.  People are always asking me questions like "what does this mean,  'raise money.'  Raise means children growing up, right?"  I am starting to see all these weird connections between words.  For example, lighning strikes, you strike out on your own, go on strike, see a strikingly beautiful woman, etc., etc.  Strike is a good, solid Anglo-Saxon word.  It seems to imply a jolt in many different situations.  Going out on your own is a jolt, as is seeing a beautiul person.  Interesting....  Also, I visited the Globe Bookstore in Prague.  This is a hipster, ex-pat hangout in central Prague.  I feel very hip using the word ex-pat in a sentence.  Anyway, new additions to my collection are Kerouac's Dharma Bums, Carson McCuller's Ballad of the Sad Cafe, and Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera.  It says something that I spent over 30 dollars on books and 22 dollars on my hotel room.  Who needs a shower when you have a book?  Incidentally, I didn't shower for the three days I was in Prague.  I just trusted my cleaniness to Secret Deoderant.  It's strong enough for a man, but ph balanced for a women, so I didn't worry.  These are the times when I am glad my hair is only 2 inches long.

      Ahh, Praha.  Fantastic, brilliant, wonderful weekend in Prague.  I am completely in love with this city.  The entire place is a work of art.  I walked around Prague castle, across the Charles Bridge, through Old Town Square and Wencilies Square.  I also visited the national musuem.  All of these areas were solid wall to wall tourists, even though it's low season.  It is hard to believe that Prague was ever a Communist area.  It is about as capitalist now as any place could be.  I even had that common American experience of seeing a KFC, then walking one block and seeing another KFC.  Reminds me of that line in Best of Show, "We were both at Starbucks, but not the same Starbucks.  I was at one Starbucks across the street from her Starbucks."  Or something like that.  In connection to that, I think I ate in a restaurant alone for the first time.  I went to Pizza Hut and ate by myself.  I was not too bad, but I would have liked some company.  I think I was the only person alone in that place.  I seem to end up eating fast food whenever I go out alone.  I really don't like fast food, but Pizza Hut always feels familiar and I can understand the menu.  I will try to become more daring on my next Prague visit.  I hope to go back in a few weeks. I also had my first ever stay in a hostel.  I am traveling on the cheap.  I should say CHEAP.  My room was 11 dollars a night.  The place was fine--quiet, clean, etc.  My one major problem was that I never figured out how to unlock the door.  It was a very strange door with a doorknob that didn't turn.  Unlocking it involved some complex system of turning the key twice and pushing.  I never got it.  I am the kind of person who isn't sure what end of the screwdriver to use.  I think the mechanical part of my brain was dismantaled and absorbed by another part.  Anyway, it appears to be gone.  It is kind of sad, but I think I will stay somewhere else next time just because I was annoyed by the door. ;) Finally, never ever exchange money at one of the touristy Chequepoint exchange places.  I gave them 60 dollars I got the equivalent of 45 dollars back.  When I realized this, I was absolutely livid.  Highway robbery!  The bill said something about printing costs for money or some other b.s. like that.  But at least I didn't get pickpocketed. I would also like to thank Clint and Kendra for their witty, insightful comments.  Sorry I never get time to respond directly, but they are much appreciated.  Makes me feel like my words aren't falling into a void or something.

      Great news!  I found a bookstore in Olomouc with one bookcase of English titles.  Olomouc is about an hour by car and I go there fairly often.  I bought two books--Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and Zadie Smith's White Teeth.  I have already finished In Cold Blood.  Fabulous book!  I had never read any Capote before, but I will definately seek out more of his stuff.  Because I am in such a bookish mood, I would like to take this opportunity to start a small book review.  So everyone gather round, pull up a chair and a plate of goulosh.  My only book review rule is that I will only review books I like.  Nowadays, book reviews have become savage excuses to shred authors and books.  "Let's see some blood on the page!"  Personally, I would rather just not hear about books the reviewer doesn't like than witness some poor writer torn to pieces.  Maybe because I identify with the writer.  Anyway, without further ado:  Kim's Cozy Book Review Corner  This week I'd like to examine my new favorite writer, Breece D'J Pancake.  Mr. Pancake only wrote one collection of short stories before killing himself at age 26.  The resulting collection, The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake, is a stunning look at life in rural West Virginia.  The characters are almost invariably angst-filled young men working blue collar jobs.  Pancake renders these blue collar characters without sentimentalizing them or insulting them.  I found the characters poinent and sympathetic, mainly because they all long for better things in their life but can't seem to escape fate and West Virginia.  Pancake's writing style is spare and subtle.  Landscapes seem to mirror emotions and foreshadow later events.  Altogether an amazing performance by such a young writer.  It's a shame Pancake is no longer here to produce more beautiful writing.    Also in good news, I got one of my poems published!  My poem "Extension and Withdrawal Parts I Through IV" will appear in The Rectangle, the journal of the interrnational English Dept. Honor Society.  It is nice to a few acceptances to offset the 50 or so rejections I have gotten in my writing career.  Ah well, the road to the publishing house is paved with rejections.

      For all of you stock exchange fans, Oct 7 is the anniversary of the introduction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896.  Also, this week is National Chili Week, Canadian Customer, Service Week, Math Literacy Week, Nuclear Medicine Week, Teller Appreciation Week, and German-American Day.  I feel rather festive.  Who knew there was so much drama in the second week of October?  Also, what is Teller Appreciation Week?  Is it for bank tellers?  I think they do deserve their own week because they take a lot of guff from annoyed people in banks.  Horray for Teller Appreciation Week! I got this fascinating information from the Publisher's Weekly newsletter.  Every week, PW lists holidays, etc., to give booksellers display ideas.  Now I want to do a display for Teller Appreciation Week.  Maybe have pens on chains dangling from the  ceiling for decoration.

      The rains have set in here.  I am preparing for two months of cloudy days.  Luckily I rather like rain.  From inside, it is kind of cozy.  I will let you know if I still feel that way in two months.  I am going on a trip to Prague this weekend.  It is a three hour train ride from here.  I am going to stay in a hostel and pack in as many sites as possible.  Hopefully, I will get to go there several more times before I leave CZ.  I have been thinking about the names of cities and countires.  All the countries in Europe have different names in Czech than in English.  For example, Croatia is Crovatsko.  Also, Prague is Praha and Vienna is Wien.  I have wondered why we don't all a country by the same name.  I would imagine that everyone should call a country be the name they call themselves. Strange and interesting.  If my posts seem dashed off it is because my computer access has declined.  One secretary left the company where I work, so the computer I normally use has disappeared.  A little frustrating, but what can you do?

      Hi All,        Croatia was great.  A little cold for swimming, so the toplessness issue never came up.   The highlight of the trip was  a boat trip to Krka waterfall.  I also think I've gotten the hang of driving my boss's car.  I drove several times in Croatia, and everything worked smoothly.  An interesting feature of Croatia's streets is that many only fit one car, but people drive both directions on them.  Basically you just try to watch for any oncoming cars and then pull over into the bushes to let the other person by.  This does reduce asphalt by half but I wouldn't recommend it for the States.

      First, I'd like to thank Jade for commenting all over my blog.  I don't know how to respond to comments, but I appreciate them and always read them.  I spent Thanksgiving dinner at a party thrown by the 7th Day Advantist Church.  It was pretty fun.  I particularly enjoyed the rocking out hymns they performed with the pastor on electric guitar.  The dinner menu was a bit unusual, but a good effort.  There were several plates of cut-up turkey and, curiously, a huge number of chopped tomatos and pickles.  I did miss stuffing.  Stuffing from the turkey is the best part of Thanksgiving, I think.  So I hope all of you out there are enjoying some stuffing this holiday season. Oh, it was also a little funny when a girl at the party asked me, "Do you really eat pumpkin pie?"  It is a perfectly normal question, but it just struck me as the kind of thing we ask about other cultures, like "do they really eat snakes?"  And Clint, there is no Tofuky here.  I don't even think there is tofu.  CZ is the land of beef and potatoes.  And beer.  Lots and lots of beer.

      Happy Thanksgiving!  I hope everyone is with family and friends enjoying a huge, long, tasty meal.  I remember past Thanksgivings sitting around all morning with the smell of turkey cooking.  I remember the waiting and the smell even more than the actual eating, (though the eating was good too!).

      Egads!  There is so much to report since my list post, I'll have to resort to the bullet list:  1.  Turned 23 on Monday!  Yea!  Happy Birthday to me!  I feel old for the first time.  23 is like late early 20s, rather than early early 20s.  I'm almost to early mid-20s.  Godd! ;)  2.  Went to Prague on Sunday and stayed at the most horrible hostel yet!  At 2 a.m. the upstairs bar closed and a hord of loud roudys came down.  You could smell the hormones on them.  They sat in the room outside yelling, screaming and discussing private features of their anatomy.  Privacy please!  On the plus side, I met a nice Aussie girl.  3.  I met up with my cousin Tim and moved into a 5-star hotel room he paid for as a Birthday present.  Famine to Feast.  An hour after I got there, a posh butler showed up with a bottle of champaign and called me Madam.  When I left, I took everything that wasn't nailed down--the shoe polish, vanity kit, shaving kit, dental kit, body wash, mouth wash, stationary.......  4.  Walked through Prague with Tim on the grand tour.  We made it to pretty much every site in 2 and a half hours.  Later stopped off for dinner.  Thank you so much, Tim!  I could never repay your generosity!  5.  Went out to the Roxy with Aussie girl and an American friend of hers.  Was offered ecstacy, but refused.  Talked to an older guy from Torronto about his travels in Asia and Europe.  Was amazed that American girl is funding 3 months of backpacking from unemployment checks.  6.  Got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  7.  Was told to get on the train to Brno at the train station, did so, and discovered 3 hours later that it doesn't stop in Zabreh.  Backtracked to Olomouc, then Zabreh.  The typical 3 hour trip ended up taking 6 hours.  Doh!  I did get a lot of reading done.  8.  Went to bed totally exhaused last night at 10.  9.  Please disregard item 6.  I was thinking of someone else.  Did you get all that?  Busy, busy, busy.  This was a wonderful birthday.  I just wish I could have seen more friends and family (though it was great catching up with Tim. Thank you again, Tim!).  I miss everybody, but I'll be home for Christmas.

      I've been thinking about all these concepts of not judging other cultures that I learned in sociology.  I frankly think it's impossible not to judge and I am not sure if it is healthy to not judge anything.  Shouldn't we have independent standards of right and wrong that apply to everyone? For example, yesterday I was teaching advanced students and we talked about the lack of women in management jobs.  One man in the class said that men should be managers because women create problems when they have these positions.  The reason is that "harrassment of women is natural."  I just about jumped out of my seat.  Eventually I said that if men are harrassing women, the men should stop.  The solution isn't for no women to be managers, it is for the men to grow up.  There was some awkward silence after that.  I must say that the men who are really sexy are the ones who respect women.     In lighter news, I saw a hedgehog yesterday.  I was walking after dark and I saw something coming up the sidewalk.  Under the streetlights, it looked like a large rat.  I went up to investigate (being strangely drawn to rats since I did research on them in high school) and saw it was a hegehog going about its business, ignoring me.  I tried to feed it some bread, but it wasn't interested.  This is the first real life hegehog I have ever seen.  I am not sure we even have hedgehogs in the U.S.  I remember a Beatrix Potter book that I loved about a hedgehog.  It was called Mrs. Tiggie Winkle and the hedgehog was a little washer woman who lived in the mountains.  Kind of an odd book, but I loved it.  There is such ingroup/outgroup mentality around the world.

      Personally, I love being bustled, if it is by the right people.  :) Well, I may go to Prague this weekend to visit my cousin, Tim, who is coming for a business meeting.  Kind of cool to hook up with my cousin in Prague.  It has been years since I've seen him in the U.S.  Strange to come all this way and encounter family from back home.  I have to watch my pennies though, because all this travel is draining the finances.  I have finished my Christmas shopping, though.  I have very mixed feelings about the whole Christmas spending orgy.  This year I had planned to make donations to charity in the names of family and friends, but CZ has too much cool stuff to pass up. I remember the first time I encountered the idea of not buying gratuitous stuff for Christmas.  I was about 18 and had just started meditating.  A guy at the meditation group told everyone how he buys his friends groceries for their Birthdays as part of simple living.  I thought it was so cool and glamorous to buy soy milk and tofu for people's birthdays.  Perhaps I felt this because the guy himself was totally cool and glamorous.... but that was years ago.

      Hi All,  I hope everyone had a good weekend.  Vienna was great.  Saturday night at a loud, crowded club; Sunday at the art museum where I spent about 7 hours and still didn't see everything; Monday at Schurnburn Palace walking around the garden feeding crackers to fat, red squirrles.  Perfect, huh? I stayed in a hostel dorm room with 7 other people.  All women and no snoring, but still a little hard to sleep.  I was out of bed every day by 6:30. If you plan to visit Vienna, remember that it is wicked expensive.  Cokes at the club were 5 Euros, which is maybe 7 dollars.  Also, the train ride from Brno to Vienna cost 16 Euros, but from Vienna to Brno it was 20 Euros.  I'm still trying to figure that one out. I picked up a City Spy map with all the hipster hangouts.  The writing in this map is fabulous--like Kerouac in wonderland or something.  Listen to this description of the store Boots: "Leather deviant's & all others are welcome to come by & invest into your fashion lines.  Big boots, little latex bussom halters etc......Bring your own beer!"  Now you know where to find latex bussom halters in Vienna.  This is for hipster hangout Wirr: "It s sort of the student ghetto's living room, full of 'Weltschmertz' people with little eyeglasses & holes in their underpants getting stuck while sipping one 'Achterl' red after the other & as all good students Wiener's know more about the bottom of a glass than a fly's ear..."  I think there is a comma missing in there somewhere.   This is my favorite: "Fine weather courtyard bustling with that which bustles or would be bustled."  Is that prose poetry or what?! You can find more at http://cityspy.info

      I was on Amazon.com and I read an excerpt of the Dali Lama's book, The Art of Happiness.  This excerpt was from the introduction written by a pyschiatrist about meetings with the Dali Lama.  The Dali Lama told the  psychiatrist that happiness is the purpose of life, and at first the psychiatrist thought this was selfish.  Then he investigated further and decided that thinking of your own happiness is really good for the whole world.  He cited some research that people in good moods are more generous and friendly.  I spent some time thinking about this idea.  Is it really altruistic to live for your own happiness?  Are happy people always nice people?  Similarly, are all mean people not really happy?  It's a tangled issue.  In my own life, I feel that I became more happy when I stopped worrying so much about myself and thought more about others.  This is kind of a reverse process--be altruistic and become happy; rather than be happy and become altruistic.  I really don't know.  I would like to read the Dali Lama's book and hear his views on the matter.  I remember seeing the Dali Lama at the Huntsman Center and he seemed so laid back and friendly.  I remember he rocked back and forth while he listened to people's questions.  Very cool.

      A foggy morning.  I am busy planning a weekend trip to Vienna.  I was checking out hostels online and one of them advertised "free hot showers."  I love this.  It's like, "not only can you sleep here, you can even shower.  And in hot water, too."  You know you're poor when you stay at a place that advertises showers.  Ha!  Well, I had no illusions that I was poor.  Or maybe I should say frugal.  Yes, frugal.

      Czech vs. English spelling  English--telephone Czech--telefon  English--Pizzeria Czech--Pizzerie  English--television Czech--televize  English--vegetarian Czech--vegetariansky  English--homosexual Czech--homosexualni  English--injection Czech--injekce  I am sitting at my desk next to my cup of soup and two big boxes of empty wine bottles.  I haven't asked about them.  A misty musty morning.  I'm wearing a black T-shirt and jeans because all my other clothes are lying damp on my hotel room bed.  This was the big weekend for washing, with me hauling a garbage bag full of dirty clothes up the hill to Mr. Hosek's house to use his washing machine.  All Czech washing machines are small white boxes kept in the bathroom.  There are no Czech dryers.  I've noticed that clothes dry at mysteriously different rates.  For example, my black socks seem to dry much faster than my white socks.  There must be some interesting physics behind this.   I have also become addicted to cable television.  My favorite stations are MTV Europe, MTV2, MTV Hits, MTV Base, VH1, and VH1 Classics.  VH1 Classics is especially good.  I think Cher had some fabulous hair back in the 70s.

      I am trying to help a nice Czech lady find a job in the US as an au pair, and I've realized how hard it is to get into America.  Basically, from all the research my Mom has sent me over email, it looks like it is nearly impossible for her to come to the States unless she has family or can perform a job no other American can do.  It is nice that most any college grad from the US can go anywhere in the world to teach English.  I've looked online at other places I could go and it seems like anything is possible.  I don't know that I would live abroad again, but it's nice to know there is the option.  I would also like to wish everyone a belated Happy Halloween.  Halloween is barely noticed here, which is sad because it is my favorite holiday.  I spent Halloween playing a form of European bowling called skittles.  I wonder if this game was named after the candy or the candy was named after the game.  Anyway, in Skittles the ball is smaller and has no holes.  You roll it underhand straight down the track.  There are nine pins set up in a diamond shape and it is almost impossible to knock them all down.  Playing this game is quite hypnotic.  You get into a flow of rolling the ball down the track, watching the pins fall and picking up another ball. I also went for pizza afterward with a few people from work.  One of them was an old man who got totally drunk and wanted me to come to a brothel with him.  This guy has probably been married for 40 years and has four grandchildren.  Rather distasteful.  I have no idea what he expected me to do at a brothel.  That is one of the more surprising aspects of CZ.  It is a lot like Vegas--porn and brothels everywhere.  Utah's porn czar would have a ball here.  You can walk into any gas station and find a stack for porn mags right above Vogue and GQ just hanging out there for everyone to see.  No one thinks a thing of it.  I personally find opposition to porn a strange thing.  I think porn is totally harmless as long as it's not violent, etc.  Brothels are more complicated.  Maybe it would be better for the US to legalize prostitution and regulate it for the safety of everyone involved.  I really don't know.  It does seem strange that the US is so progressive about technology, film, music, yet so uptight about sex compared to a lot of the world.  Must be the remains of Puritanism.

      I am fascinated by the little ad box at the top of my blog.  Today I believe it says something like "Buy Wormwood Seeds" and "Hotels in Prague."  Last week it had something about "Write a Memoir in 28 Days."  I keep wondering how it gets ads so closely related to my blog entires.  It must do a word search or something.  Aren't computers amazing!  The new Gods of the the 21st century.  For those of you who would like a precise definition of absinth, here is the entry from dictionary.com  1. A perennial aromatic European herb (Artemisia absinthium), naturalized in eastern North America and having pinnatifid, silvery silky leaves and numerous nodding flower heads. Also called common wormwood.   2. A green liqueur having a bitter anise or licorice flavor and a high alcohol content, prepared from absinthe and other herbs, and now prohibited in many countries because of its toxicity.  There you have it!  Absinth is toxic green alcohol that was consumed by the Bohemians during the great Bohemian Revolution at the turn of the century.  The green fairy is the name many people gave to Absinth, I think because you were supposed to see the green fairy after you drank Absinth.  This is something like the pink elephants Dumbo sees.  I would suggest consulting the fabulous Baz Luhurman movie Moulon Rouge for an excellent depiction of the green fairy by Aussie pop star Kylie Minogue.  Lisa, I hope this answers your question.  I purchased some of this toxic alcohol in Prague, and we can drink it at Christmas (if they let me take it back to the U.S., that is).  In book news, I finished Kerouac's Dharma Bums and loved it.  Jack seems like an old pal; his writing is so friendly and conversational.  I love his enthusiasm for nature and eating pea soup.  He totally lacks cynicism; I don't think he could have survived the 90s.  Anyway, I don't think many people could read this book and not want to climb a mountain and make pudding in the snow.  Well, I didn't want to climb a mountain because I am afraid of heights, but I was on board for the pudding in the snow.  On a side note, I am also afraid of wasps, toilet seats, and new people (old people sometimes as well).

      Well, I have officially changed the description of my blog.  That means the European experience is really over.  I think it was good to have the time to think about what I really want to do with myself.  Now I feel pretty fired up about getting job, writing, exercising, eating better, etc.  Europe also made me appreciate all the nice things I have here.  Like I can walk down to the library and find pretty much any book I want.  I still remember the book starvation in the Czech Republic.  For a while there, I was praying for words in English, anything, a VCR instruction manual, anything, just let it be in English, please!  But that is behind me now.  I also appreciate hotel rooms.  When I stayed in Vegas with my parents, we went into the room and said to myself "wow, what a big bed.  And there aren't any strange people here talking or throwing things.  Ahhh."  Now any hotel room that I don't have to share with strangers is pretty luxurious.  It's good to appreciate the small things.

      Yesterday, my family had our annual Christmas dinner at the Parvazs'.  Jasmine Parvaz has been Lisa's best friend since junior high, and we've been doing this dinner for about 6 years I think.  I had some unexpected good news when Jas's little sister, Ally said "Oh, I saw a poem of yours published."  I think I said, "What?"  She had picked up Listen magazine and seen one of my poems in there a few months back.  That was pretty surprising.  I sent them three poems last spring and didn't hear from them, so I just figured they weren't into my stuff.  I wonder now if they tried to email me in the Czech Republic.  I was having some computer problems, so it's possible that I just didn't receive it.  Anyway, Ally had saved a copy of the magazine and gave it to me.  It felt great to see something of mine in there.  I was having some downer feelings about my writing last week, like "oh, I'll never get anywhere," so this was a nice pick-me-up. In other news, I am thinking of attending the Unitarian Church.  My life has been missing spirituality for a while now and I feel I need to get back to some sacred space.  I've been curious about the Unitarians for a while now.  It seems fine to be a Unitarian Buddhist.  Anyway, I don't like to label myself any particular religion, so maybe the Unitarians would work for me.

      Snow.  That's all I can say.  Snow everywhere.  There is probably about two and a half feet of snow in our driveway.  And all that snow has to be painstakingly moved one shovelful at a time.  I think the best way to approach it is as a free workout.  I was considering joining Bally Total Fitness last week and they wanted $80 to start and $30 a month after that.  Why do that when you can shovel snow for free?  And you get the benefits of fresh air.  ;) I probably will start taking ballet again at least, and maybe yoga too.  I was a complete blob in the Czech Republic.  It's so easy to lay in bed eating goulosh and watching German MTV.  I think my heath will improve a lot now that I don't have access to cable.  I also want to get out on my snowshoes in the next few weeks.  I remember I saw a moose the last time I went up Big Cottonwood.  It was already dark and the moose walked up the trail and lay down right across it.  We had to crash down through the bushes to try and get around it.  I still remember the way it smelled.  We probably smelled weird to it too.  Jade, I wish you could come out to Utah and go snowshoeing again.  You are welcome anytime!  Also, anyone else who want to go snowshoeing, just give me a call. Well, this was my first Christmas away from Salt Lake in my entire life.  That's a landmark.  I spent Christmas Eve in Phoenix with Lisa's boyfriend and his family having a big dinner.  The lack of snow was a little odd, but I enjoyed not having to shovel.  On Christmas day, we were in Vegas.  The place was packed wall to wall people, every slot machine taken, and a line for the buffet that went around a corner.  I love the tinkling sound slot machines make.  You know there is an engineer somewhere who spent weeks designing that sound.  It rained all the time in Vegas, and there was two feet of water running down the street in front of the Imperial Palace.  I also heard on the news that terrorists wanted to hijack a plane in France and fly it into a Vegas casino.  I guess you never know what can happen these days.  Well, Happy New Year everyone!  May the new year find you happy and healthy and ready for the next adventure.

      Merry Christmas!  I hope everyone is enjoying the holidays with family and friends.  In a half hour, I am starting on a trip to Phoenix to visit my sister, Lisa (hey Lisa!).  This will be my first Christmas away from home.  Feels a little strange, but I'm sure the weather down there will be great.  I am ready to soak up some sun after the Czech dark days.  When I return, it's back to the job search and preparations for moving.  I may look around in Phoenix a bit and see if there are any prospects.  I am feeling the combination of excitement and fear knowing that the future is wide open and will most likely involve a relocation.  I know that I am ready to move on, so the feelings lean more to excitement, luckily.  :)

      I'm home!!!  The jet lag is finally wearing off, so I decided it was time to blog.  It feels like I was in Prague 6 months ago, and I was there on Sunday.  I must say that I miss cobblestone streets and buildings that looks like art, but I am glad to be back in Salt Lake, where the sun always shines and everyone speaks English.    The flight home seemed more difficult than the first one.  I had spent Sunday night sleeping in a hostel dorm room was six strangers, and had to get up at 5 in the morning to make it to the airport.  Then, on the 10 hour London to Phoenix flight, I sat in the dreaded middle seat.  The whole process from getting up in Prague, to getting home to Salt Lake took over 24 hours.  I ended up going to sleep at 5 in the morning Salt Lake time, which is the equivalent of 2 in the afternoon  Prague time.  But at least I was in my own bed.  Ahhh.  Absinth party!   I would like to invite anyone interested to join me for an encounter with the green fairy.  I brought home a small bottle of absinth and am preparted to share it with anyone who wants to taste the official drink of the Bohemian Revolution.  I also learned the right way to mix absinth with orange juice: 1. Put sugar in a spoon. 2.  Pour absinth over the sugar. 3.  Light the sugar/absinth mixture on fire until sugar carmalizes. 4.  Put the sugar/absinth into orange juice and add additional absinth.  This is a drink that will knock your socks off.  Absinth is 75% alcohol and contains a compound similar to marijuana.  Therefore, it causes hallucinations if you drink enough.  So stand warned, but come anyway.

      When I next post an entry, I will be home on my laptop in Salt Lake.  On Sunday morning, I will get a ride up to Prague, spend the afternoon there, and leave early Monday morning for the 24 hour return journey.  I must say that I actually enjoyed the cross-Atlantic flight.  For some reason it reminded me of camping.  You get all your food in these little packages and it is difficult to get to the bathroom because the seatbelt light is always on (this is one potential problem...).  I particularly like the eyemask and socks that you get.  The socks are too big for me, but I wear them anyway because they are my special British Airways travel socks.  And you can watch a movie on a tiny screen with headphones.  Ah, the tiny screen and headphones. I would probably get pretty tired of this whole process if I did it very often, but for now it is still special and interesting.  And considering how expensive it is, I will probably never take long flights enough to get bored of it. Cheers everybody.  I'm coming home!

      Does anyone remember that great 80s game Candyland?  I suddenly thought of it last night for no particular reason.  I can't recall much about the rules, just that it had a lot of cool places you could visit like gum drop forest or something.  Do kids still play that game?  I would like to have an 80s games party one day.  We could play UNO and battleship and Twister.  Twister was pretty cool.  Twister is like yoga for kids.  It's a zen thing.  Some other cool 80s stuff:  1.  Pong 2.  Smurfs 3.  Captain Crunch Cereal 4.  The Monster Mash 5.  Care Bears 6.  Pac Man 7.  Reading Rainbow with Levar ("Take a look, it's in a book") 8.  Michael Jackson before his issues 9.  High tops 10.  Jelly bracelets

      Here is the question of the day: Why aren't people covered with hair like other animals?  I read an article about how scientists are still debating this question.  Some scientists think we have no hair so we could remove bugs from ourselves more easily.  But I would think that it would be harder for a bug to get to you if you had hair.  And if this were the case, wouldn't all animals be hairless?  All animals have to contend with bugs anyway.  So here's some interactive blogging a la Kendra: What is your theory about why humans don't have hair.  I personally think it might have something to do with sex.  You only need to watch MTV for ten minutes to see what a big deal sex is for humans, I think much more than for other animals.  So maybe this has something to do with the hair thing.

      This past Sunday I saw the first snow of the year.  It was just a light sprinkle in the morning before the sun came out.  It was a perfect scene for that great George Harrison song, Here Comes the Sun.  After two months of almost daily clouds, I appreciate the sun more than ever.  So if it is sunny where you are right now, look outside and appreciate the beautiful light and warmth.

      I remember a year and a half ago, a lady I know from meditation had a huge yard sale.  I got there at the end, but she basically sold everything she owned and took off for India.  She said to me, "I am so glad to get rid of all this stuff.  I feel so free without it."  Anyone who has ever moved knows that feeling of "my God, there is so much stuff."  It's a heavy feeling, the "I have too much stuff feeling."  It's the stuffed with stuff feeling.  I have this feeling right now contemplating taking my stuff back to the U.S.  I don't think I have much more than when I came, but it was a job getting everything out here.  My one big suitcase weighed 70 pounds.  I am really hoping I don't have to get it on a train.

      I just read a sad report about how the Great Apes are going extinct.  Apparently, they often die from human diseases like the flu.  Kind of a strange throwback to the destruction of Native Americans by European diseases.  Also, the apes are extensively hunted for meat because the native people are so poor they need the food.  This seems to be a common theme all over the world.  People are so desparate that they don't consider their enviroment.  To them, a rainforest is just a bunch of plants in the way of grazing land.  It seems to me that helping the people improve their situations is a good way to protect the environment.  I think it's especially important for richer countries to help others with birth control.  It's terrible that President Bush cut funding for birth control.  This kind of squimishness about a public health issue could destroy a lot of the planet.

      Here's something funny, Czech people have a dish called American Potatoes.  It is similar to French Fries, but with fatter pieces.  Maybe the Czechs will change the name if they get upset with the U.S.  Maybe Army Pride Potatoes, or Anger Potatoes would work.  I am coming back home in two weeks!  America seems like a dream.  Odd how you can leave a place and it's almost like it doesn't exist.  I know that a few weeks after I'm in the U.S., CZ will seem like a distant memory.  My boss says I can come and visit anytime, which is nice.  I would like to come back, but I don't know when I'll have the cash to travel to Europe.  Who knows.

      I'm not sure if I've written about this before, but it's pretty fascinating.  This is a list of the sounds animals make according to the Czech language.    Dog: haf                  Pig: chro  Goat: mee               Sheep: bee  Chicken: ko              Horse: hi  Cat: mnau  So when you go to the Czech Republic, you should say hi to the horses and ahoj to the people.  I still remember talking to a guy in CZ and he could not believe that a pig ever made a noise like oink.  I don't have enough experience with pigs to know if they say oink.  So that's the deep philosophical question of the day: do pigs really say oink?  Or do they say chro?  Or do they make a sound that isn't convertable to human writing?  Hmmm....

      Let it stand that I officially became an adult on Jan. 26, 2004.  I now have a commute, a cubicle, and a water cooler to stand around.  I also have to wear grown-up clothes, no more fish net stockings or ripped jeans.  Too bad, huh.  I suppose I'm not totally an adult because I still live with my parents.  Having dinner made for you every night isn't very adult.  Also having to call home if you're out later than midnight isn't too adult.  I guess I'm about half-way adult.  Maybe three quarters adult.  I would probably put my adult percentage at .6895433.%

      Yea!  I have a job, sort of.  It's actually an internship in marketing at Gibbs Smith, Publisher in Kaysville.  The pay is low (ok, very low), but it will be a great experience at a respected publisher.  I'll also get the chance to do some writing with this job related to publicity.  So the days of sleeping until 10 are officially over.  I have to be at work by 8:45 Monday.  That means leaving at 7:45 to drive through rush hour traffic.  Anyway, I'm pretty happy that something has come along.  It has felt like a lot of things in my life haven't been working for the past month.  I'm hoping this means things are looking up.  I'm also going to work one day a week at Pince-Nez Press where I interned senior year.  By the way, Pince-Nez Press has a new book coming out--Confessions of a Slacker Mom.  It's about parenting without stressing out and becoming OCD.  Looks pretty good.  You can order it at pince-nez.com.  See, I'm already getting used to marketing.

      So now I regret a little bit that I wasn't a communications major.  I am getting much more interested in the possibility of writing for magazines, and a communications major would serve me much better for that.  Oh well.  Life direction can be hard to find when you're 18 years old.  Heck, life direction can be hard to find when you're 23, or 40.  Anyway, I enjoyed all my psych classes.  I think for sheer interest psych can't be matched.  The only problem is that the jobs I'm now interested in don't come from a psych degree.   I also just discovered that blogger has a spell check function.  Yippee!  I write these posts pretty fast and don't really proof them.  At least spell check can pick up the worst offenders.  I taught creative writing to senior citizens, and one of the ladies in class said that spelling is a creative art.  I totally agree with her.   :o)

      Sunday I went to church for the first time.  Thanks to Kendra for coming along because I probably wouldn't have been brave enough to go alone.  :)  We went to the Unitarian Church in South Salt Lake.  The service was very nice, no actual mention of God, angels, devils, fire and brimstone, just a discussion of getting out and doing good works like Martin Luther King, Jr.  Martin Luther King, Jr. was an amazing person.  Whenever I get cynical because of things happening to me personally and in the rest of the world, I think about people like Martin Luther King, Jr. and I have faith in humanity again.

      I was looking through the want ads today, and I saw an opening for a hod tender.  I have no idea what that is, but it sounds kind of relaxing.  "What do you do for a living?"  "Oh, I just tend the hod.  It doesn't need much attention."  Somehow it sounds to me like a kind of plant, maybe something like hay.  Maybe they feed hod to hogs and hay to horses.  I also saw an opening for a sheep herder.  I wonder if herding sheep is like tending the hod. Anyway, I have gone through many agonizing hours of deep rumination, and I have come to understand that the novel I am writing has to come first no matter what I do.  I just started when I got back home and I have about 36 rough pages finished.  Basically, it's now or never.  I've got to give this book 100% of my brain or I'll never finish it.  So basically I am not in career mode, I just need a job to get by while I write.

      Lisa is here! Yea!  Lisa is interviewing for two internships here in health psychology.  If she picks one of them, she would be moving back to Salt Lake for a year.  She has interviews at seven other places, so we have to see what happens.  She just came from Little Rock, Arkansas and said it was quite nice.  She has also gone to San Antonio (not Houston, Kendra) and Wisconsin.  It seems like a lot of people are preparing to dispurse across the country.  I am curious to see where everyone ends up (myself included). In other news, I have been lolling around looking at Want Ads and trying to decide what to do.  You know you have a lazy life when you get up and take off your sweat pants for sleeping to put on your sweat pants for the day.  The sleeping until 9:30 is also pretty luxurious.  Don't be too jealous.  It will end pretty soon ;)  The issue is that I don't have any savings right now and Salt Lake almost no jobs in publishing.  So basically I will have to do some other kind of work to build up savings, and I am not sure what kind to do.  If anyone has thoughts, please let me know.  Thanks.

      Ok so now I have to get a job.  Like today, before the next credit card bill arrives.  I went down to the mall to buy some new sweat pants and ended up with two pairs of shoes and a new shirt.  Everything was so cheap, I couldn't help myself.  The shoes at Wet Seal were $10 each, down from $50 originally.  That's a great price, so I am justified, right?  Right?  Anyway, I wear my clothes until they disintegrate into little pieces, so I never waste anything.  But now I have to buckle down and not spend any more.  Amazing how fast money goes!  Like pay phone calls are now 50 cents.  What is up with that?  I remember back in my youth when they were 25 cents.  People had a work ethic back then.  They knew how to clear snow off driveways without these fancy smancy snowblower deals.  I don't know what the world is coming to :^D  I believe it has something to do with the presidency of George W.  I don't trust that man.  Something in his eyes.  He's shifty.  First there are weapons of mass destruction and then there aren't.  What is up with that?  And all those people who drive hummers.  That bugs me.  Do you know how much CO2 one hummer produces in a year?  24,100 pounds!  (Sierra Club Magazine, Dec. 2003)  A Honda Accord makes 10,300 pounds.  Why would anyone drive a hummer unless they are traveling across the Iraq desert looking for weapons of mass destruction (which they probably won't find).  *@3&!  (o+09!   I feel much better now.  I experienced a little blood pressure spike for a moment there, but everything is fine now. Happy New Year!

      HAPPY NEW YEAR!  I had a quiet New Year's Eve at home with my parents.  I watched the New York ball drop thing on TV and toasted with some Martinelli's cider, but that was about it.  I considered adding some absinth to my Martinelli's, but I'm a bit worried that I could learn to like that stuff too much, so I refrained.  I also watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, very odd movie.  I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, and he did a great job, but that movie is just one drug-induced hallucination after another.  Hunter S. Thompson also has a pretty interesting voice.  Overall, I'd give it 1 and a half stars. I also discovered yesterday that I have gained 11 pounds in the last four months.  I don't worry much about my weight, but it's interesting considering that I haven't gained a pound since I was 17.  Must be all that Czech fried cheese.

      Forgive me for I have been remiss in blogging.  It's been a busy two weeks.  This morning I sat watching the snow fall and realized I need to take more time for quiet sitting and contemplation.  I think I got in a situation where my brain was always two steps ahead of my body, trying to figure out what to do next.  Lately I've been getting back into meditation to find that calm spiritual space.  This past year has been a whirlwind when I think about it--graduating, going to Denver, going to Europe, coming back, interpersonal drama, trying to find a job, starting a job, etc., etc.  I think it's time to chill for a little bit.

      Right now I'm thinking about the conflict between doing work you love and making a living.  I bumped into an acquaintance who stopped working for nonprofit organizations because she made so little.  It's unfortunate that people doing really valuable things, like working for nonprofits or teaching, have to struggle financially.  On the other hand, people who work for tobacco companies and weapons manufacturers are rolling in cash.  There is something wrong with that picture.

      I'm reading the Tipping Point right now.  Great book.  I highly recommend it.  I was reading the section on Market Mavens and realized that my mother is the greatest example I know.  A Market Maven is someone who knows the price of everything and the best way to get a deal.  My mother actually keeps stacks of Consumer Reports dating back ten or so years and refers to them whenever she wants to buy anything.  She stockpiles toilet paper when it's on sale and comparison shops between supermarkets.  She goes to Dan's for fish and Albertsons for produce.  It's amazing.  I don't think I have the energy to become a Market Maven.  I'll have to depend on my mom.  I am pretty good about buying things on sale, but I have no idea what the going price is for toilet paper.  For years I've tried to convince my mom to go on The Price Is Right, but she doesn't like the host guy.  She thinks he's shifty.  She's probably right.  I would actually like to go on Jeopardy some day to make use of my pointless trivia knowledge.  For example, did you know that the blue whale is the largest creature that has ever lived.  It's true.

      Today at work I completed a huge blad mailing.  Blads are color reproductions of book covers with a few sample pages inside.  It's a pretty menial task, but there is a kind of Zen to it.  You can get into a hypnotic state when you're stuffing one envelop after another after another.  Also, I am fascinated by the similarities between the words blad, blog, and blob.  I would like to write a poem using those three words, maybe a sonnet.

      I played chess against my friend Bob yesterday.  He won (he also won our other game).  I was just considering how chess is a very feminist game.  The queen is the most powerful peace, while the king can barely move and needs everyone else to protect him.  Maybe we're meant to think that the king is really old and bedridden, so the queen really has all the power.  It's interesting considering that chess is a very old game and wasn't created at a very feminist time.  Anyway, I feel like I'm getting better at chess and want to keep playing.  It's pretty fun.

      I'm reading a pretty interesting book called Join Me.  It's a about a British guy who started his own cult (or as he calls it, collective) by putting an ad in the paper saying only, "Join Me: Send one passport sized photo to the address below."  He just did it for fun to see how many people would respond.  Eventually it became a group devoted to random acts of kindness, a good direction for it to go.  It's an interesting thought to see how many people would join a totally undefined group like that.  I think that people actually want to be part of something.  There's a lot of alienation today, and maybe things like Join Me can counteract that.  Anyway, it a pretty fun, funny book.  I recommend it.

      Yesterday I recieved the most backhanded compliment ever.  I had passed by a salon near Cottonwood Mall that advertised eyebrow shaping and said "walk ins welcome."  I wanted to get my eyebrows done by a professional eyebrowist, so I went in and forked out $20.  The girl who did my brows was made up and dressed to the 9s, while I was in my scuffed shoes and sweater.  She said "I can tell you'll want your brows to look natural.  You're certainly a natural girl."  She said all this in quite the tone of disdain.  Just as I was about to leave, she said, "I never take walk ins, but I saw you and said that you really need your eyebrows done."  Hey, thanks.  I guess my eyebrows were an emergency case.  That lady need to check her salon's sign.  I remember reading that Kate Moss got a backhanded compliment when someone told her she was looking "healthy."  In the modeling world, this means fat.  Go figure.

      I'm editing a new book about polygamy.  It's amazing to read some of the things the polygamous guys say in here, like "do not voice your opinion if it is contrary to mine."  Men seem to always be the ones making the rules, huh?  Hopefully that will change in the future and everyone will be equal.  I still think women's rights are a pretty big issue in the world with genital mutilation and forced prostitution in many parts of the world.  I've always felt so lucky to have been born in America where at lest things are a little better.

      I spent most of today washing, waxing, and vacuuming my car.  There is something satisfying about a clean car.  My brain feels more cluttered if the environment I'm in feels cluttered.  Next I'm going to move on to cleaning my room.  I have little piles of papers all over the floor that I need to get out of the way.  It'll be nice to see the carpet again and get rid of all the dust bunnies and spider webs.  I think cleaning is actually really good exercise, too.  Why go to the gym when you can clean your house?  Well, I guess you can't meet potential dates while cleaning your house, but still.

I think everyone should consider spring to begin with the first day of sandals. I'm also considering going to Wendover for the weekend with my parents.  Wendover is kind of odd.  It's amazing how you can cross over from East Wendover to West Wendover and watch the sin creep over everything.

      Here's a great word-nerd joke that demonstrates the importance of proper comma use:  "A panda walks into a cafe.  He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.  'Why?' asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards the exit.  The panda produces a wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  'I'm a panda.  Look it up.'   The waiter turns to the relevant entry and finds the explanation.  'Panda.  Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China.  Eats, shoots and leaves.'"  Ha! Ha! Ha!  Doesn't that just crack you up?  Who ever said punctuation was boring.  That joke came from the book Eats, Shoots and Leaves, which I'm reading to refresh my editing skills.  Cool book.

      I'm proud of myself because I had a fairly productive week.  I've written a new nonfiction piece that I want to send out to magazines soon (I'm keeping my fingers crossed).  I'm still tweaking this piece, but I'm pretty proud of it.  I've also gotten a couple of applications done that I've procrastinated on for a while.  Probably the most exciting thing to happen this week is that I was involved in a protest at Smith's on 9th and 9th.  The protest was organized by the group CodePink to address the fact that Smith's keeps its condoms and pregnancy tests in a glass case that's locked after 9 pm.  This restricts access to the condoms so people have to embarrass themselves asking someone to open the case.  I stood on the sidewalk outside of Smith's holding a pink sign that said "Condom Liberation" and wearing a pink beehive hat made out of a spray pained flowerpot.  We handed out a lot of condoms to passers by and gave a writ of habeas corpus to the Smith's manager.  It was really quite fun.  Now I want to protest something else.

      Today I went on a fun hike with Kendra (hey Kendra).  We didn't go too far because it was cloudy and cold, but it was still nice to get out.  I love living in a place where the mountains are ten minutes away.  Right now I'm making a resolution to hike more 1) to get in better shape 2) to enjoy nature.  I'm also making a resolution to eat more cheese.  Cheese is a healthy, simple snack and I'd like to support America's dairy farmers.

      I just went to the dentist and found out I probably need gum surgery.  For years I brushed my teeth too hard, and now my gums have receded around one tooth.  Doh!  It sounds pretty unpleasant.  The dentist will have to cut a chunk of flesh out of my upper palate for a graft.  And I thought brushing thoroughly was doing the right thing.  It just goes to show you that everything in life is a balance--if you brush too hard, your gums recede; if you brush too soft, your teeth rot.  I think that's my new life motto.

      I'm finally getting underway with a book idea I've had for a long time.  The idea is basically coverage of day jobbing writers, actors, musicians, painters, and dancers and how their day job affects their art.  This week I'm doing my first two interviews for the book--a musician and a painter.  I'm excited and hopeful that everything will go well.  Personal Plug: If there are any day jobbing writers, musicians, actors, painters, or dancers reading this, please get in touch with me if you'd like to be in my book.  I can use all the help I can get!  Anyway, I'm hoping that future generations of day jobbers will find this book helpful on the quest to living by their art.

      Well I thought it was time to move into the modern world and post a picture of myself.  This pic is a bit old, but I still look pretty much the same (my hair is a lot shorter).  I'll try to scan in a newer picture if I can figure out where the scanner plugs into the computer.

      I'm feeling rather disoriented because the Blogger people changed the layout of the website.  Just when I was getting the hang of which buttons to push, they have to go and do that.  The post I just published has the line spacing all wrong and I blame this new fangled technology.  Now there's some weird thing where you keep typing along the same line forever.  Very confusing.

      Somewhat related to my last posting I have now become addicted to the Friendster site (by the way, anyone is welcome to add me as a friend).  It's just so fascinating to click on  friends and their friends and on and on forever.  My cousin Jade introduced me to the whole thing and she has some really interesting friends, people like models and musicians.   One of Jade's friends has 500 contacts on Friendster.  I'm not sure if I've met 500 people in my whole life.  I feel a bit jealous, but I have three good friends on there, so I should appreciate what I have.

      I've been thinking about this phenomenon of people reading blogs by people they don't know because they're linked to the blogs of people they do know.  That was a very long sentence!  Anyway, I've started looking at the blog of someone who comments on my sister's blog.  (Hi Lisa.)  It's like a little window into a stranger's life.  Maybe there is six-degrees of blog separation between most people in the world.  People who don't own computers can't blog, but they might know someone who blogs.  I think eventually the degrees of separation between people will get smaller and smaller as everyone is interlinked through blogs and IMing.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that the blog can bring about world peace.  Thank you.

      Well I got to Sarah Lawrence safe and sound and now the conference is almost over.  On  one hand I feel like I've been here a long time and on the other it feels like I just arrived.  Bronxville is very cute and a 5 bedroom home costs 2 million.  So it falls into the category of a nice place where I don't have a snowball in hell's chance of ever living.  Unless I marry rich.  To do that, I should probably look into breast implants, but that's another story.  One high point so far has been seeing fireflies for the first time.  Somehow I thought they just glowed constantly like Christmas lights, but they're more like sparks--sudden flashes.  Pretty cool.  I have gotten good writing feedback as well and have some revision plans for an old piece.  Anyway, I should probably get back to work.  Cheers.

      Well tomorrow I'm on my way to NYC for the Sarah Lawrence Writers Conference.  As a typical procrastinator, I haven't packed yet.  Luckily I'm not working tomorrow and my plane doesn't leave until 11 pm.  This should be an interesting trip, though I am a little bummed I don't have any day job artists signed up to interview.  I'll have to snoop around coffee shops and approach people who look creative.  I'll be watching for berets and black turtlenecks. (Puma sneakers also seem to be part of the standard day job artist uniform).

      I've gotten a fascinating new book--Buzz: The Intimate Bond Between Humans and Insects.  Most of the book is photos of bugs taken with a scanning electron microscope.  It makes their eyes look blue or red and their bodies look lime green.  Very interesting. This book also has facts about bugs such as, "It's been estimated that 10 percent of the weight of a two-year-old pillow is composed of dead dust mites and their droppings--dung that the dust mite may reingest as many as three times."  I think my pillow is about 6 years old, so 30 percent of its weight must be dung and mites.  I'll be thinking about that when I go to sleep tonight.

      Hey All,  I just discovered a cool new web site--www.digsmagazine.com  One of the musicians I'm interviewing for my book told me about it.  Very similar to Ready Made Magazine.  I want to do a project on there making a box from old album covers.

      I've gotten into Bookcrossing since I heard about it from Lisa (hi Lisa). Tomorrow I will release my first book, How To Be More Creative.  I think I'll release it at the Community Writing Center, a good loction for book people.  The idea of becoming more creative from a book somehow seems ironic to me, but this book has some interesting ideas.  Here's one: "Stand up and look between your legs for two minutes.  Is anyone watching?  If so, this exercise is doubly effective: to people are gaining a new perception of their surroundings."  When I first read this I thought they meant something else when they said "look between your legs."  Then the thought of someone watching was a bit disturbing.  I mean, hopefully you'd already be aware that someone was down there, right?  If not, I wonder about you.

      Yesterday I helped a lady with a resume and she had worked as a blackjack dealer for five years.&nbsp; She said the money was really good, but the lifestyle was unhealthy.&nbsp; She herself started drinking and gambling too much.&nbsp; I must admit that after talking to her I had fantasies of going to Vegas and becoming a blackjack dealer.&nbsp; Seems like it could be a&nbsp;cool day job for a writer.&nbsp; You see lots of different people and it's not too mentally taxing.&nbsp; I love Vegas and I don't drink, so I felt that I wouldn't fall into any alcoholic problems.&nbsp; When I told my mom, she said it seemed like an immoral job.&nbsp; We've had a few compulsive gamblers in our family, and my mom said that job would be supporting&nbsp;bad habits.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I don't think gambling is evil&nbsp;in itself, if you only gamble a little.&nbsp; But my mom is probably right that the casinos don't care if people throw away their life savings.&nbsp; Not very Buddhist.&nbsp;

      Well Kendra is heading out for a new life in Austin.&nbsp; I went&nbsp;to Bombay House with her, Jon (Kendra's husband), and my parents.&nbsp; It was definitely bittersweet.&nbsp; Kendra and I have had some great times.&nbsp; I'll miss the Scrabble/cooking nights and hikes.&nbsp; I've seen several waves of friends leave Salt Lake over the years.&nbsp; That seems to be the way of things.&nbsp; Life is about change, huh.&nbsp; My&nbsp;writing mentor, Steve, is also moving away to Upstate New York and Lisa is moving to Palo Alto.&nbsp; I have noticed people moving in clumps.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; I wonder if that's an urban legend, like every ten minutes a crowd goes silent (have you heard that one?).

      I was thinking yesterday about how little it takes to get me really upset.  This past winter I had a relationship that was emotionally abusive.  The guy would say I was stupid and laugh at me among other things.  In the scheme of human events, this is pretty minor.  I mean, there are people being sold into slavery and starving to death in this world, but it's amazing how much it hurt.  I think maybe it was more what the experience represented.  I had trusted this person and he turned on me.  I told my sister at the time that I wondered how I would ever trust anyone (or maybe any guy) again. I don't feel that way now but I'm pretty cautious.  The whole thing was a learning experience but mostly I learned about the ugly side of life, things I didn't want to know.  The trip to NYC was great because I felt like I finally let that person go while I was there. I basically said, "I won't let you make me miserable any more."  It was just a decision I had to make.  I remember an old friend told me that happiness is a choice.  You have to choose happiness because there are so many things you can fixate on and make yourself unhappy.  So many glasses aren't just half fill, they're smashed up and scattered across the sidewalk.  You have to see the beauty in the glittering broken glass.

      As Kendra mentioned in her comments, I have gotten my ears pierced.  For a long time I subscribed to the notion that you shouldn't alter the body from its natural state.  I took great pride in the fact that I had no piercings, gauges, tattoos, etc.  Then a few years ago, I got my hair highlighted and I started down the slippery slope.  Now I'm considering a tattoo, maybe my Chinese name in characters on my back.  The one thing I worry about is whether I could develop an allergy to the ink.  Hmmm....    The other cultural phenomenon I find interesting is tattooing someone's name on yourself.  So here's today's poll: would you ever consider tattooing someone's name on yourself and if so, where would you put it?

      So I'm taking a poll.  How many of you out there think I should grow my hair long and how many think I should keep it like it is.  Should I dye it red or blonde or not at all?  Please vote for a combination from the choices listed.  Thanks.

      Hi All,  NYC was fabulous!  Fabulous, fabulous!  I went to the Frick Museum, the Natural History Museum, and a great club (Lotus--$20 cover).  I'm basically ready to move there, but money is a big issue.  I also would like to get a dog and I would hate to inflict a studio apartment upon one.  I'll definitely work for a year and then see what my options are.  Big thanks to my cousins Alison, Jade, and Sue Ling who all showed me such a good time.  Hopefully we'll all meet up again soon.

      So I got a call a few days ago about my 5th high school reunion. Instantly I remembered that line from Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion:  Romy: So are you going to the reunion?  Janeane Garofalo (can't remember the character): I'd rather stick this [cigarette] up my ass.  The Janeane Garofalo girl ended up going to the reunion, but I don't think I will. Isn't five years way too soon to have a reunion? I'll make the declaration now that I will attend my 50th high school reunion. Then enough time will have gone by.
