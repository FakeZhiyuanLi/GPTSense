      So a weekend in the country did some good, both for my cold and my sanity.  It amazes me how much slower time passes when I am out of the city.  Although it was a little too slow for me at one point.  The checkout clerk at the greocery store move at the speed of molasses.  I could have checked myself out and the 15 people in line in the amount of time it took her to ring up my six items.  Saw a baby goat at the flea market that was so cute, I wanted to buy it.  I don't think he would agree with my tiny apartment, however.  Or my cat.

      My first post.  I cannot think of anything remotely interesting or inspiring to say today. My head is cloudy, not sure if it is the cold or the cold medicine, or a combination of both.  Looking forward to a relaxing weekend in the country.

      I had an interesting encounter with my shadow today.  I hardly recognized it.  No, it was not the time of day when the sun stretches your shadow so you appear 7 feet tall.  It was early morning when the shadow is short, similar to your actual height.  I saw my shadow as I hurried to work today but had to stop and wonder, when did my shadow get so skinny?  Yes I have looked in a mirror and yes I know that I have lost weight, but seeing it there on the ground in front of me was certainly a sight to behold.  All this time my shadow has been shrinking and I had no idea!

      So I am in the midst of what you would call a change in health.  I have started eating properly and exercising.  Who knew after all these years of feeding myself junk I would say something like, "I could really go for some spinach," or "oh, no I am all out of yogurt!" Like a parallel dimension. And I don't know what the hell size clothes I wear anymore.  I spend time in the dressing room and everything is too big or too small.  I am in some sort of size purgatory.

      Why is it that when it rains, people automatically lose about 20 IQ points?  They run in front of cars, they stand under trees even though it is thunderstorming, they forget how to drive.... Rain is more fun in the country I think than the city.  No cars to splash you as they race through a large puddle while you are waiting for the bus that never seems to come, because buses always disappear when it rains. Considering they have been forcasting rain for today all week, I was surprised by the number of tourists walking around completely drenched.  Then again, I think being a tourist affects your IQ too.

      You would think at some point, after listening to the CD for 6 weeks non-stop I would get tired of the Avenue Q soundtrack.  But, nope.  I daily need my fix of Kate Monster, Trekkie, Princeton, and everyone else.  I find myself humming it and then I just have to play it.  I really want an I-pod, but at this point it seems like it would be a waste of money considering I only listen to these few songs over and over and over again... Is there other music out there?  Could I go a day without hearing "It sucks to be me" or "For Now."  I shudder to think.  You have to go after the things you want while your still in your prime....there's a fine, fine line, between love...and a waste of time.
