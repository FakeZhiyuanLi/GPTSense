        Washed by the silvery waves of the Arabian Sea, occupies a significant place in the tourist map of Kerala. Interlocked with a large number of canals and bridges, this water locked district has immense potential for backwater tourism.     Alappuzha, a centre for coir and carpet industries is an ideal headquarters for backwater touring. The large network of canals provide Alleppey its lifeline. It has a long sandy beach which is spectacular. At one end are the dense palm groves that are so characteristic of Kerala's landscape.    Visit  urlLink alappuzha.com  and  urlLink ats-Global

      In the long-run called life we face various ups and downs. Certain deeds which never deserve appreciation is very-well welcomed; while generous thoughts are wildly thrashed. Why does this happen? Who is responsible?    The web of our life is knitted complexly, a thick wallet is never spared of pain; while an empty stomach swaps with sumptuous peace of mind. If we don't laugh at a fool, why should he act foolish? If we don't applaud at a victory, why should he tackle for success? Each deed is complimented by yet another one, which may or may-not have a relation. Why does it happen?    Exploring vast will widen the discussion, so lets narrow it down to a small are. Office or Family is the smallest and the closest arena in our life, where a hell lot of emotion-exchange take-place. Certain thoughts are appreciated and certain others are bashed.    Let's come down to an office atmospheres. A group of people from different financial, social, and education background join together under one roof having a more-or-less same target; the growth of the firm, and in-turn the growth of yourselves. When you are in the motivation driven run, you start facing problems one-by-one. Flairs from the hierarchal structure, attempt to sack your innocence, credit hacking, sex in office, romance in office ... (the list goes long.)    Some or other respond with heavy heart to any of these, due to strange or genuine reasons. You may promote love, but not love-making. You may promote chat but not flirt. OHHH! Who are you to promote or decline? What right do you have to question, whatever nonsense happen? (there comes the questions from the hierarchy.)    That's not over; most of the corporate structures entertain healthy suggestions, which will boost the spirit of the organization. What you feel healthy may not be wealthy or worthy enough for your boss or you foolish supervisor. He will open fire on you. So better keep MUM.    Finlay! your suggestion will be sooner or later implemented in the company without any COURTESY. You remain stupid for ever.

      The concept of a VIRTUAL OFFICE is as old as the Internet or the WEB. How can this be effectively implemented? How can this help the eligible international unemployed work-pool?    The Internet, the dream for a century, came into reality in a very different way; and is growing sigmoid beyond the expectation. But the real reason for it's making is yet to materialize.    The commercialization of the Internet came immediately as the US military authority decided to widen the webbed network, which was used for military communication and transfer of sensitive data among a secluded, high sensitive community of officials. This opportunity was grabbed by a group of intelligent community round the globe; who for-saw the tremendous growth expected in the Web-World. They trickily laid the foundation, keeping in mind the way they could monopolize the concept of e-commerce. Things come free, without any price tag and no hidden agenda, for then. But that was not to last for long. Slowly slowly, but steadily new concepts came which was very well accepted by the public and globe began to shrink to our desktop and later on; right in your palm or your pocket. Anything is possible if you have a credit card number to flash (no wounder you have a big hole dug into your wallet)    Then came pornography and hacking. Why should we spend our intelligence to challenge others, and the economy of the society? Why should we gift the public with hell lot of things to think in sleep-less nights?    The general tendency to open something, which is secluded or kept under a private watch; is another evil. And if some one argues that, something is secure; then there is someone else who will burn out midnight-oil to burst the security. Who gains?                                                                                     The concept of open source came into being to neutralize the monopoly brought by Bill Gates business empire Microsoft. To some extend it did work. But is Linux really OPEN?    Now let me come to the point. I drove long-way, away from the topic to conclude that behind every though or concept introduced to the Internet, there is definitely a factor that boost personal interest or centers profit making. So we will proceed with the same policy.    There are millions of talented unemployed youth in and around the globe, who don't even have access to the NET. If we propagate the concept of OPEN OFFICE or VIRTUAL OFFICE to empower these poor community to think and work as a bundle, and volunteer the profit generated in a sharing basis, the world economy will be neutralized, and the question for looking upon developed nation will be NULL. They will provide us the work for only a little more time, and not for ever. We should generate work of our-own, for not letting us looked-down up-on.    A group of youth in each state, or a small colony form a small internet community having access to infinite bundles of similar colonies, having free communication with each-other. The work should be pooled into these communities, and a group to moderate the returns, based on the hardship and effort, and cost of living index, should be instituted under the watch of global peace and unification bodies. Irrespective of the culture and creed, work should be alloted to meritorious. Also a platform for learning should come into being, to educate and familiarize those who are backward, and love to learn.    If such a thing come into life, then slowly slowly you will see the corporate structures diminishing, to a little smaller entrepreneurship, and there will be no place for hacking or security hijacking policies.

      Unemployment is the driving force of all society. Now whom shall we call unemployed? And why is unemployment said to be the diving force?    Each and every society of the globe has it's own heritage and destiny, but still the scope and future; remains in the hands of the leader, the corporate monsters. They decide the rate of automation, the balancing of wages to work, and the rate of employment.    Students, the professionals of tomorrow is grabbed right from the steps of the University, if they graduate with a fantastic mark-list, and are honored with a dignified designation in some of the biggest corporate structure; and later on they become their slaves. They loose the capability to think; what is happening to them, neither, what their future will be. A hand full of these young professionals; climb up the ladder of the corporate hierarchy, which we assume to be the fittest among the best grabbed. No! They are the cunning fools among the Brilliant mob.     This cunning professionals with plenty of exposure and wider relationship with the global business, turn to be the Boss of the global corporate structure. This is a vicious-circle, and is going on and on.    Now whom shall we call the unemployed? The employees are the unemployed; what to say then about the real unemployed, who struggle for their bread; who are even ready to work for a lesser wage, than that any secular society or social body advocate. This finally leads to the steep reduction in wages and enhances the availability of cheap skilled professionals in and around the globe. The cheap sector of unemployed-pool of the globe is the fishing ground of the corporate empire of the developed nations. This is the breeding ground of employed unemployment. Working hard, but, not meeting their needs.    It's time each of us think of shattering the scenario of the corporate leadership which is draining the global wealth to their selfish thoughts of building their empire wider and high. Why don't you think of your own? Why don't you think of an organization which will benefit all in the same proportion, the worker and the leader?

      It's kind of interesting, that, when something happens to make you feel down, you can't really concentrate on anything that sits in the sunny side of your life. We love to be the unsinkable and unshakable. If you too are of the same kind then PAUSE. Read the next few lines slowly...    "Usually, anything along the lines of "It's my life, and I don't care what anyone else thinks!" is a warning that you're doing something stupid."    Sorry friends. I am also among these category. But a small difference (maybe true or not) I am cool in criticizing others. But, if someone dare to be a critic of mine; I will be down. Am I stupid?    ... ... YES ... ... NO                                                                                                                                                OK if yes or no you people answer I have happy. 'coz I am not coping to get criticized.

      Dear Microsoft,    I've recently come in contact with a great number of problems dealing with Internet Explorer and standards-based design. Your browser consistently renders elements incorrectly, but it's not just the famed incorrect box model; instead, little bugs that never should have made it into release candidate software are plaguing my designs.    For example, in a recent project, I use floats to control layout within a div with an image background. However, in Internet Explorer, the floats destroy the background, causing the background to either not display or cover its content.    Another example: If I try to make my source code readable by adding whitespace to my unordered lists, your browser incorrectly adds this whitespace into the list.    Now I realize that Internet Explorer has been out for a long time and that many people use it, but that's no excuse to ship a clearly inferior product. Perhaps you should think about dropping the Internet Explorer project and leave browsers to companies that understand what constitutes web design — like the Mozilla Organization.    Your product is holding back the evolution of web design because most designers won't embrace new technology unless it works flawlessly in the majority of their audiences' browsers. Since most people use Internet Explorer, the roadblock is you.    So shape up, Microsoft, because if you don't, you're going to have a generation of angry designers knocking down your door and storming the empire with Wacom tablets and empty Photoshop boxes. Listen to your developers; add  native  PNG alpha transparency, fix the box model, and spend a few extra days beta testing to find the little things that can ruin a designer's day and give your browser such a bad rap.    You're the largest software company in the world, you didn't get their by releasing inferior products — though many may disagree with that statement — and you shouldn't start now.

						     K  erala is a small state on the southwest corner of the Indian Union with a total area of 38,863 Sq. Kms, having a population of 2,90,98,518. When India became free, Kerala, as we know it today, was not in the geographical map of India. It was under two Princely States Travancore and Cochin, and Malabar, which was under the direct administration of the British. The Princely States of Travancore and Cochin were integrated into the United States of Travancore Cochin on 1st July 1949. Malabar remained part of Madras Province. Under the States re-organisation Act, 1956 Travancore Cochin State and Malabar were integrated to form the State of Kerala, on 1st November 1956.   High Court of Kerala  came into being     from  1st November 1956 , with its seat at Ernakulam. Its roots go back to the Rulers of Travancore-Cochin, to Colonel Munro - the British Resident and Diwan in the Travancore State and the political agent in Cochin State- the architect of the well regulated judicial system in both these native states, to the High Court of Madras with its tradition of a hundred years and over, to the Travancore High Court, to the Cochin High Court and to the Travancore Cochin High Court.    urlLink Read More ...

       Once upon a time, just the other day, a baby girl was born to a couple. The father, upon finishing school in Chennai, had taken the SAT exam and gone on to the United State of America in order to graduate, post-graduate, doctorate and post-doctorate in computer sciences exactly as the mother had done, the two having become engaged to each other at birth through an understanding between their respective sets of parents, the idea being that together they would make as many dollars in California in as little time as possible, this being the right thing to do for all good families. Mummy and Daddy, who were very keen on ethnic identity and national culture, which was also the rule among all good families, scoured the Bigmarole Vedas on the Internet in order to find for their new born baby a properly Sanskritic name that could be properly anglicised in a stylish contraction. After much effort they lovingly settled on Aishmita, which as a mathematician would put it, is a convex combination of the names of two National Goddesses of Beauty. At home and at school, little Aishmita came to be called Ata. (This, of course, had nothing to do with her pale, pudgy, floury complexion). Mummy and Daddy loved little Ata dearly, but they didn't have an awful lot of time for her, seeing as how they were so tirelessly preoccupied with discovering their national identity, making lots of transnational money, helping to build a temple in San Jose, and assisting with raising dollars to demolish a place of religious worship belonging to another community back home in India. So they got their old widowered grandfather, Thatha to come and live with them and look after Ata. Now Thatha was barely functionally literate, having had some sort of education with an accent on solid geometry and hydrostatics, which had equipped him to retire as a postmaster, but otherwise left him utterly incapacitated when it came, for example, to making anything of television advertisements. The consequence of all of this was calamitous, as we shall immediately see. In this muddled and fuzzy way, Thatha was hopeless when it came to dealing with the consumer products of an advanced industrialised economy. This was too bad in an era of globalisation. In the cause of little Ata's personal hygiene, what do you think he went and did? Why, he brushed her teeth with hair-dye and washed her hair with a bleacher. The outcome is there for you to see in the accompanying pictures (being self-portraits, they were drawn by Ata herself who, as you can see, allowing for some smudging, was a gifted child and, like other diasporadic children, attended a special shcool): little Ata acquired shiny black teeth and sparkling white hair. Mummy and Daddy flew into a rage. They diced up Thatha into little bits in the shredder and concealed the outcome(s) in the refrigerator. This is why this is a true, but chilling, story.

          Why do people play football for 45 minutes, not 30 minutes or 1 hour?        Even the sports scientist and some of the senior players   could not give the right answer.     In that confusing situation one sardarji came up with   a reasonable answer.     He said....   "The reason people play this game for 45 minutes is...   There are 2 teams and there are 11 players in each team.   Each player brings his ow  n "2 balls" So in total there are 44 balls.  There is one ball on the   ground itself. Thus the grand total is 45".     Question Answered !!!     Sometimes there is extra time of 2 mins which is the referee's own   balls!

      An unimaginable Chief Editor lives in Kerala (Gods own Country; at-least let god fee shame) INDIA.  An extract from his mail:   Already, it have been fixed that what procedure should be followed in each stages of proofing. According to the procedure, this error should have been found in the T1 or P1 stage not in P3 or QC. If we assign these type of responsibilities also to the people working at later stages, it will result in the unwanted delay or extra time consumption in later stages.  However, the operators in the later stages should also have a quick look on the file and try to find these type of errors.  What is QC?       A system by which a desired standard of quality in a product or process is maintained. Quality control usually requires feeding back information about measured defects to further improvements of the process.  urlLink  www.iteawww.org/TAA/Glossary.htm        System of control meant to guarantee, by periodic inspections, that a certain amount of quality is being maintained during the production of the product in question.
