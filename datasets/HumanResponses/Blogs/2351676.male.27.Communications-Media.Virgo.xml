      Context is everything! A saucy joke at a party is great fun, evoking laughter, but when repeated at a funeral, will only evoke furrowed brows and thoughts of insensitivity.  Sensitivity is required! A hearty "good morning" to a cheerful person may elicit one in return, while a depressed person will probably either ignore you and your greeting.  The point I want to make is that unless you understand the context of a particular situation and are sensitive to the feelings and circumstances that those people are in, a helpful comment can be viewed negatively, a by-the-way remark can be blown into an important statement, etc.. Maturity, balance and giving people the benefit of the doubt until they can be given time to explain are always required. Ultimately, all things will be tested by God who alone can render a perfect judgment because He knows all things and He knows the hearts and motives of all involved in any particular issue. But that will only be on the Day of Judgment which is yet future.   How are we to proceed in our days? The answer for us now is to test all things by God’s plumbline, the Word of God, for the Scriptures are very clear with respect to what is truth (pure, unadulterated truth) and what is error (truth that is mixed with human philosophy, traditions, wisdom from below).  Jacob Prasch has made many statements about Alpha and the Purpose Driven Life which need to be explained in the light of what God’s Word says about it. He lives in the UK, a nation that has already seen the effects of more than 10 years of Alpha and he speaks with first-hand knowledge of the things that have happened there.  How then are we, in Singapore, to view his statements?  Let me begin by setting the context for us.   When the gospel first came to us in Singapore in the 1800s, it was already a "liberal" gospel, in the sense that when the "gospel" was presented, usually there was very little mention made of the need to carry your cross to follow Jesus, the need to die to self, the need to obey the Lord Jesus Christ plus the very real possibility of hostility and persecution by family members. Instead, what was held out was usually the promise of eternal life, healing, peace, mercy, grace... (which are all true and are all wonderful).   However the problem arises when these things are held out as "enticements" to "accept Jesus". Who could resist such a good offer? If I can have Jesus and heaven still continue to live any which way I want, why not? It’s always good to have an egg in every religious basket, another insurance ticket to a good life after death. Why not "try" Jesus? as if He was like a product to be sold! Remember the "I Found It" campaign several years ago.  I myself came to "faith" under such a gospel and it was only about 10 years later that I was brought to a realization that Matthew 7:21-23 was true of me. Previous to that, I was trained to evangelize, to ask people this very significant question: "Where would you be if you were to die tonight ?" and to give a very significant answer: "I don’t know about you, but I know where I will be...in heaven!" If I had died at any time before I truly came to faith in Christ in 1984, I would have ended up in hell instead! But God had mercy on me and brought me to Himself after a very traumatic and difficult time.   It was only after I got involved in 1987 with Kay Arthur who wrote Precept Bible Studies that I began to understand what God meant by what He said. When Kay taught about the possibility of "Christians" not being born again, it was a novel concept to me. I never knew that the Bible taught that, for I was taught or it was implied that whenever one prayed the "Sinner’s Prayer", one is saved, and whenever I had doubts about my salvation, I would be "reassured" of my salvation. When I asked how I could know I was born again, I was told that I would pray (I did that), I would do good works (I did that), I would give (ditto), I would serve the Lord (I did, in various ministries: Sunday School teacher, Youth leader, sang and lead in the choir, evangelized, etc.), that I would read the Bible (read it through at least once and read several Christian books though I didn’t understand much then). Conclusion: I must be born again! But... the niggling doubt would come back time and again during those 10 years.  It was only after I was truly born again and had studied the Word of God inductively, and saw for myself what God had to say about this issue that I understood that I was never born again in those early ten years of my "Christian" life. I thought, and, I’m sure, many of my church family thought, that I had backslided, then repented and was restored. The reality was I never was born again. The Scriptural evidence of a changed life that is patterned on our Lord’s was never there. Oh, I had changed, no doubt about that, but not enough. It was merely putting on different clothes, adopting a different behaviour that was acceptable to church people, more like reformation rather than genuine transformation from the inside out.  I also learnt that a lot of the Bible teaches about HOW you can know that you’re truly born again and that one major emphasis, as expressed by 2 Peter 1:10, is to ensure that you know for yourself that you are truly God’s child, called and chosen by Him (see Matthew chapters 5-7, the whole books of James and First John, plus relevant portions in Paul’s Epistles and Peter’s, Scriptures concerning the New Covenant and many more).  Some students tell me that they got born again in my Romans classes, although they have been in the church several years (I can only speak of those who told me, there may be more). Because of the awful reality of Matthew 7:21-23 where our dear Lord said, "Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord’ ... and...I will declare to them, ‘Depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness’", I ensure that I always speak about this issue and give people Biblical ways of checking their own salvation every once in a while.  All this just to bring you to the point where you may understand the next statement I make with maturity and understanding.   Unless you have gone into God’s Word to know exactly what is the very gospel that our Lord Jesus and His apostles preached, anything that sounds like the "gospel" that you came to faith in, would sound very biblical, wouldn’t it?   By the way, I hope you know that you can only measure what is out there by what is in here, i.e., in your mind. If you don’t know, you don’t know. We’re not born with an instinctive understanding of truth, although all truly born-again believers are given the resident Truth teacher inside who will guide them into all truth (see John 14:26; 16:13; 1 John 2:20) and one thing we need to keep on doing, is to keep on putting truth into our heads and hearts! Living it out ensures that truth gets from our heads into our hearts!  Line up whatever is said about the Gospel of Jesus Christ with what the Bible says about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and then make your judgment. The book of Romans would be one of the most excellent plumblines for the Gospel.  How then are we to respond practically to the use of things like Alpha, the Purpose Driven Life, the Passion, various Bible Study materials, etc..?  Scriptures are very clear that all believers are to submit to leadership, even to ungodly secular leadership (see Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-15). If that is so, how much more then should we submit to godly leadership in the church?   I take my cue from the writer of Hebrews who never criticized the weak leadership there, but filled in the gap for them. Those leaders were strong on good works rather than on the Good Word, so...he wrote the wonderful letter of Hebrews to help settled the major problems in that congregation. Note: I’m sure you know that when leaders tell God’s people to sin against the Lord that that is the time when God’s people must take a stand against it (see for example, Acts 5:29).  What if your leaders insist that you use these aids as a tool for evangelism? After all, so many unbelievers come and some have come to faith in Christ. The physical numbers are there, the tangible results are very evident right now.  Your dilemma (for those who took Jacob’s words to heart) seems to be between choosing to go against God’s appointed authority structure, or offending your Lord? Obeying your leaders and injuring your conscience or taking a stand and hope to be understood? Is there a way out?My personal stance is this: I will always use the Bible. If my leaders decide to use things like those mentioned above, I will study and compare and see what’s missing that needs to be put in, and put those things in and take out that which is unbiblical. Frankly, it doesn’t matter to me what is being used, because anything that is used, if I’m to lead and teach it, I will always cause to conform to what the Bible says. I trust that in this way, I can both satisfy my leaders and my Lord, obey them and still maintain a good conscience before the Lord. If I’m not allowed to do so, then I must beg leave from them to not do something that my conscience is not clear about and trust that my leaders are godly enough to know that believers should never violate their conscience (see 1 Corinthians chapters 8 and 10), and they will graciously release me to do other things for the Lord that will build up His body.

      I believe the time is now that in Singapore, we are being exposed to another gospel, one that is subtle and dangerous; we are no longer safe within the church, where the gospel of Jesus Christ, is being diluted, compromised, and changed are being preached.  &nbsp; It remains clear that unless Christians today began to fall on their knees and intercede and turn back to God, back to the undiluted Word of God, the Churches in Singapore will be under judgement.  &nbsp; The formation of the gay church in Singapore has shocked the christian communities in Singapore, and even more shocking, christians are beginning to accept the fact. Where's the fear of God in the church, where's the moral standard in the church, that we have fallen so far short of. The body of Christ, Christians were suppose to be the standard of morality in the society but we have totally abandoned that primary mandate from God that we are called to be holy!  &nbsp; With disturbing reports of Moonies and their movements in the United States, with thousands of christian leaders paying homage to the false Christ, has painted the picture that Christ is no longer the head of the Church in the United States, instead, it is the leader of the Moonies, or the Pope, that defines the standard of our faith, with proclaimation of another Christ, ordaining gay ministers, and other evils that are explicitly stated in the bible, these will not enter the Kingdom of God, and sadly, many have gone after these false teachers. &nbsp; In Singapore, I pray that the government will rise up to ensure that such destructive cults and homosexual churches will not take legal stand in our society, and the church will come back to the Word of God, and the gospel of Jesus Christ will be preached in order to take a stand against the Spiritual forces of evil, principalities and every fiery darts from the Devil.

      The issue and place of homosexuality in Christian Faith is a growing concern in Singapore and around the world over the last 12 months. With the ordination of gay bishops in the place of authority of the church has become a major talking point and eventually it is a vital call that each christian will have to face and answer - Has Homosexuality any place in the Christian Faith?  Having read an article from a church in Singapore that endorsed homosexual behaviours among the church members at Safehaven, (URL: http://www.oursafehaven.com/articles/gayandproud.htm), I cannot reconcile first, the sentiments of the aggrieved gay christian and the Word of God. In the article, the author lacks both circumstantial and evidentially support from the Word of God which should lead any discussion of the topic such as this, rather than an out of context isolated incident of a misled Christian or Christian group.  Looking into the Word of God, homosexual behaviours are one of the abominations in God's eyes.   Leviticus 20:13 Romans 1:24 - 32 1 Corintians 6:9 - 11   Article on Homosexuality from Bakers' Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology    It is significant that the word "homosexuality" did not enter the English vocabulary until the early twentieth century. The word, and with it the concept of lifelong primary sexual orientation toward members of one's own gender, was unacknowledged and probably unknown in the biblical world. Some today will therefore argue that what the Bible appears to condemn can be distinguished from homosexuality. They maintain that the homosexual orientation, to the extent that it develops in early childhood or even before birth, is not consciously chosen and is therefore not sinful. As long as this form of sexuality is expressed monogamously, it is argued, homosexual relations merely constitute an expansion of the biblical view of marriage. In order to assess the legitimacy of this approach, it is important to begin with an understanding of the view of same-gender sex in the ancient world.  The Ancient World. Because there is so little evidence of same-gender sex before the New Testament period, our view of "the ancient world" must focus more narrowly on the Greco-Roman period. Writings during this period demonstrate familiarity with sexual Acts between members of the same gender, but these were not understood to result from an "orientation." Sexuality was important in the ancient world only in terms of male progeniture. It appears that the rape of other males and the use of boys for sexual pleasure (pederasty) were performed as Acts of dominance, violence, or experimentation by otherwise heterosexual men. As a phase or as an occasional act, sex between males did not detract from male progeniture. In some circles, most notably those of the intellectual elite philosophers and poets, relationships between men and boys were lauded as the highest expression of romantic love. These relationships were not reciprocal, however. Males who were (willing or not) the receiving partners in these Acts, especially on a repeated basis, were socially outcast. Boys were bought as slaves and discarded when they reached puberty. Lesbians, who were by definition reducing the possibility of male progeniture, were scarcely mentioned but consistently condemned. Thus the modern supposition of a tolerant pagan society subsequently oppressed by Judeo-Christian taboos is a complete myth. It was, rather, a culture almost empty of regard for the sexual rights or desires of anyone but the small ruling class of men, who commonly exercised their almost limitless privilege at the expense of those young women and men in their power.  The Old Testament. Into this world of ruthless sexuality came the biblical message of restraint, justice, and sexual complementarity, which was revolutionary in its implications. From the beginning it is acknowledged that humankind is created in two genders that together bear God's image (Gen 1:27) and together constitute a unity of flesh (Gen 2:24). The reaffirmation of these two notions in key New Testament passages on sexuality (Matt 19:1-12; 1 Cor 7:12-20) demonstrates the continuity and importance of sexual differentiation in the construction of a normative biblical sexuality. More simply put, humankind is created to find human completion only in the (marital) union of two sexes. While there may be legitimate conditions under which this union will not occur (e.g., celibacy), there are no conceivable conditions in which the union can occur fully without sexual differentiation. More specifically in terms of homosexuality, then, same-gender partners can at best pretend to effect a differentiation that is physiologically (and perhaps psychologically) impossible.  Some theologians have suggested that to be created in the image of God according to Genesis means to be in social fellowship with other persons. Others deduce that homosexual relations are merely an expansion of the category of marriage under this rubric of fellowship; that is, intimacy and not biology is the appropriate measure of conformity to the Genesis marriage model. But apart from the debatability of this notion of the image of God in Genesis (dominion is the probable focus of the term), the definition of marriage cannot be limited to the meaning of the image of God. However important the social and spiritual aspects of marriage may be, the physical aspect is no less fundamental to its definition. Sexual differentiation (1:27) intends physical union, the becoming of one flesh (2:24). Because a homosexual relationship cannot produce a unity of sexually differentiated beings, there cannot be a marriage.  Condemnations of sexual sin in the Old Testament focus on heterosexual Acts, but it is important to note that all sexual sin, including homosexuality, is prohibited in relation to the positive model of marriage presented in Genesis. Thus, while the Old Testament describes homosexual activity as intrinsically unjust or impure, these condemnations do not differ qualitatively from condemnations of heterosexual deviations from the marriage model.  The first and most familiar Old Testament passage is the account of intended male rape at Sodom (Gen 19). References to the city later become common extrabiblical Jewish euphemisms for sexual perversion in general and homosexual practices in particular (in the New Testament, see 2 Peter 2:6-7; and Jude 7). Some modern revisionists point to the subsequent Jewish tradition condemning Sodom for inhospitality and argue that the passage does not have homosexual rape in view. In this view, when the Sodomites demand to "know" Lot's visitors, they want to interrogate them, and Lot considers this breach of hospitality as so objectionable that he offers to distract the men with sex, offering his own daughters. The major obstacle to this interpretation is the Hebrew verb "to know" (yada [[;d"y]), which, while not often used in a sexual sense, is used in just that sense in verse 8—only two verses after its occurrence expressing the desire of the men of Sodom. Clearly the Sodomites desired sexual relations with Lot's guests. The later references to inhospitality in relation to Sodom are not due to a misunderstanding of the sin of Sodom on the part of the Jews, but to their habit of speaking indirectly of sexual matters out of modesty.  A parallel account of sexual violence occurs in Judges 19-20, where the men of Gibeah rape a man's concubine to the point of death in substitution for the man himself. There can be no doubt that this is fundamentally an act of violence, but the initial desire for the man coupled with the sacrifice of the concubine to avoid "such a disgraceful thing" (19:24) suggests that same-gender sex, and not only inhospitality, is seen in a very negative light.  More obscure reference to same-gender sex may be found in Genesis 9:20-27, where the statement that Ham "saw his father's nakedness" may be a euphemism for rape. There may be a connection here to two additional references to sexual sins involving one's father (Lev 18:7; Deut 23:1), since Ham is the father of Canaan, the nation traditionally associated with same-gender sex and whose impure practices are condemned in detail in the context of these references.  Explicit condemnation of same-gender sexual relations occurs in two Old Testament passages. Leviticus 18:22 reads, "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable." Leviticus 20:13 reads, "If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." The wording here is ambiguous with regard to rape or manipulation versus mutual consent; instead, the focus is on the act itself as a mutual defilement. Modern revisionists often dismiss these strong passages on the grounds that they are part of the Old Testament purity code and therefore irrelevant to a gospel that frees believers from the constraints of Jewish cultural taboos. But the surrounding verses, which involve such concerns as care for the poor and respect of property show that it is impossible to make a simplistic distinction between purity laws and permanent moral principles. The reaffirmation of sexually differentiated marriage in the New Testament, as noted above, suggests that this levitical condemnation of the violation of differentiation retains its force throughout the entire biblical period.  The New Testament Message of Liberation. Some revisionists maintain that the message of Jesus is fundamentally a message concerning the liberation of captives (Luke 4:18-19). These captives, it is argued, are to be understood not in individual terms as sinners, but in corporate terms as those who are forgotten or oppressed by the proud and powerful. In this view, the place to begin a truly Christian consideration of sexual ethics is not with Genesis and the legal code but with Exodus and freedom from law proclaimed by Jesus. The homosexual community, with its long history of persecution, naturally sees itself described in the Beatitudes and other offers of hope to the downtrodden. It sees analogies to modern "heterosexism" in the historic subjugation of women and of blacks. There are, however, many problems with an approach that so simply makes biblical material a vehicle for experience. One objection is that the choice of one kind of sexual proclivity as "oppressed" is arbitrary: there is no definitive reason to exclude pederasty or sadomasochism or adultery. Furthermore, the analogies to other modern liberation movements are dubious. In the case of slavery, for example, the biblical message is ambiguous; in the case of homosexual Acts, on the other hand, what little material we have is all decidedly negative. Finally, it is impossible to evaluate a behavior by means of its perception, as if disapproval by the majority automatically constitutes legitimacy on the part of a persecuted minority. At some point the behavior itself must be held up to a light other than the fire of its own passion. The light of revelation in the New Testament message offers liberation, but explicit in this offer is the provision of power to conform individuals to full humanity as God created it. In order to exercise responsibility in relation to such an offer it is essential for believers to take seriously both the construction of full humanity as the Scriptures describe it, and deviations from that full humanity as the Scriptures warn against them.  The Gospels. There is no explicit reference to same-gender sex in the Gospels, but there may be an echo of a reference in Mark 9:42-10:12 (cf. Matt 5:27-32). A passage in the Talmud (b. Niddah 13b) links masturbation and pederasty together as violations of marriage, and in so doing makes reference to harming children, offending with the hand or the foot, and cutting off offending limbs rather than going down to the pit of destruction. These similarities of wording to the Gospel passages may suggest a common understanding in the first century that "putting a stumbling block before one of these little ones" involved sexual sin against them.  Paul's Epistles. Two brief references in Paul's letters, where same-gender sex is mentioned in lists of prohibited activities, are important especially for their link to the Old Testament. In 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 arsenokoitai [ajrsenokoivth"] are condemned. The word, a compound of "male" and "coitus" or "intercourse, " does not occur prior to the New Testament. Some modern writers have attempted to narrow its meaning from homosexual Acts in general to male prostitution, solicitation of male prostitutes, or (coupled in 1 Cor 6:9; with malakoi, another obscure word possibly meaning "the effeminate" ) the active partners in homosexual relationships. These suggestions, however, ignore the Greek Old Testament (LXX) versions of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which use both arsenos [a [rjrJhn] and koiten [koivth], the latter passage placing them side-by-side; literally, "whoever lies with a male, having intercourse (as with) a female." This is the obvious source of the compound word. Perhaps Paul himself, who knew and used the Septuagint extensively, or some other Hellenistic Jew not long before Paul's time, derived from the passages in Leviticus a compound word that described homosexual Acts in general. This drawing in of Leviticus to Paul's letters is also significant in that it provides further demonstration that he perceived a moral and not merely purity-based prohibition of homosexual Acts in the Old Testament.  Romans 1:26-27. The remaining passage appears to be an unequivocal condemnation of homosexuality. While many modern revisionists simply disagree with Paul or discount his proscription as applying only to prostitution or pederasty, some have attempted to reinterpret the passage as tacit approval of homosexuality. The argument is that Paul portrays homosexual Acts as impure but carefully avoids the language of sin; he intends merely to distinguish a Gentile practice considered by Jews to be "unclean" in order to draw Jews (or "weaker brethren") into his subsequent explanation of the gospel. Careful investigation of the passage, however, shows this explanation to be untenable.  Paul's general purpose in the context (Rom 1:18-32) is to show the need for the gospel in the Gentile world. As a result of idolatry, God "gave them over" to all kinds of sinful behavior. The trifold structure of the passage is a rhetorical device to drive home the point: a general complaint (vv. 24-25), consideration of a specific vice (vv. 26-27), and a culminating list of various vices (vv. 28-32). The distinction between the second and third sections may follow another Greek-styled distinction of sins of passion and sins of the unfit mind.  Paul is accused of everything from extreme prejudice to repressed homosexual urges for choosing same-gender sex as his focus in verses 26-27. But the scarcity of other references and the use of impersonal, rhetorical language here suggests, on the contrary, considerable detachment. The choice of homosexuality in particular is due to Paul's need to find a visible sign of humankind's fundamental rejection of God's creation at the very core of personhood. The numerous allusions to the creation account in the passage suggest that creation theology was foremost in Paul's mind in forming the passage.  Paul's terminology in the passage clearly denotes sin and not mere ritual impurity. The context is introduced by the threat of wrath against "godlessness and wickedness" (v. 18). Those in view in verses 26-27 have been given over to "passions, " a word group that elsewhere in Romans and consistently in Paul's writings connotes sin. Words like "impurity" (v. 24) and "indecent" (v. 27; cf. "degrading, " v. 24) had in Paul's time extended their meaning beyond ritual purity to moral and especially sexual wrongdoing. To do that which is "unnatural" (vv. 26-27) or "contrary to nature" was common parlance in contemporary literature for sexual perversion and especially homosexual Acts. Paul uses several expressions here that are more typical of Gentile moral writers not because he is attempting to soften his condemnation but because he wishes to find words peculiarly suited to expose the sinfulness of the Gentile world in its own terms.  The substance of Paul's proscription of homosexuality is significant in several respects. First, he mentions lesbian relations first and links lesbianism to male homosexuality. This is unusual if not unique in the ancient world, and it demonstrates that Paul's concern is less with progeniture than with rebellion against sexual differentiation or full created personhood. Second, Paul speaks in terms of mutual consent (e.g., "inflamed with lust for one another, " v. 27), effectively including Acts other than rape and pederasty in the prohibition. Third, the passage describes corporate as well as individual rebellion, a fact that may have implications for modern discussions of "orientation." In other words, although Paul does not address the question here directly, it is reasonable to suppose that he would consign the orientation toward homosexual Acts to the same category as heterosexual orientation toward adultery or fornication. The "natural" or "fleshly" proclivity is a specific byproduct of the corporate human rebellion and in no way justifies itself or the activity following from that proclivity. On the basis of any of these three implications, it is legitimate to use the word "homosexuality" as it is conceived in the modern world when speaking of Romans 1 and, by cautious extension, when speaking of the related biblical passages.  Responses to Paul's Proscription. The discussion does not end with the conclusion that Paul condemns homosexuality. Some argue that a modern understanding of "natural" differs from Paul's and requires that we absolve those who discover rather than choose a homosexual orientation. These, it is argued, should be seen as victims, or simply different, and our definition of allowable sexual activity expanded accordingly. The major problem with this response is that it shifts the meaning of "natural" from Paul's notion of "that which is in accord with creation" to the popular notion of "that which one has a desire to do." But deeply ingrained anger does not justify murder, nor does deeply ingrained greed justify theft or materialism, nor does the deeply ingrained desire of many heterosexuals for multiple partners justify promiscuity. Desire in all of these areas, chosen or not, must come under the reign of Christ. The action in question must be considered not in terms of its source in the person but in light of the relevant biblical principles. These principles often involve denial of deeply ingrained desires, for the heterosexual who desires multiple partners no less than for the homosexual who laments the option of celibacy.  There is considerable evidence that a homosexual orientation, and certainly the occasional homosexual experience, does not indicate a permanent state but an immature stage of sexuality that may be "fixed" at some point by physiological, psychological, or social factors, and by the individual will, all acting in combination. This has theological significance because it implies that movement toward completion or maturity will involve movement toward obedience to the biblical model. One need not conclude, then, that the homosexual orientation is an indication either of God's approval of the orientation or that the orientation is God's "curse" of the individual. It is, rather, a challenge to growth in discipleship, more or less difficult depending on individual circumstances, but accompanied by the promise of grace equal to those circumstances (Rom 5:19-21; 1 Cor 10:13; 2 Col 12:9).    Yet, as should why the Christian Church today on the whole struggles with this problem and remain divided.   The gay christians argued very much on the fact that the church today should adopt an understanding stance on christians who struggled with their sexual orientation and with the new law set by Christ's death on the Cross, and the covenant of Grace, it focused more on what's inside than what's on the outside.   That in my point of view, a very limited understanding on the christian precepts and doctrines that the church today are entrusted with. The Word of God takes precedence and should remain the only authoritative on this subject or as a matter of fact, on any subjects. The Word of God is plainly clear on this subject of homosexuality, but christians should always remember, that it is not an excuse to being a homophobic. This is to say, we cannot tolerate homosexual behaviours among the christian believers but to extend the invitation as God has to us, to repent and come to the saving grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ.

      Let's rewind - 2 cups of Coffee (rather bitter, but O well, it is free), 4 cups of Teh Talek (super duper sweet), and a dinner at the food court in Toa Payoh HDB Hub (trust me, it tastes horrible). Changed my second hand phone to another one, though it is not something i would like, but it works, so far, so good.  Work's slow especially off-season time, think it will pick up when English Premier League starts in 2 weeks time! howdy, i can't wait and see my favourite team   urlLink  Liverpool    in action!   Oh yes, i haven't got the chance to read my bible and pray.. must do so later before going down to the forum gathering at Orchard Kopitiam.

      I have changed it to  urlLink  Nokia 2100  ! Not a bad phone as per say, but i still prefer the silvery alluminium style 8850. Just too bad that phone is really faulty. Paid additional $15 for this including the upgrade and the extra brand new cover. The guy at the store was so paiseh (English: embarrassed), that he gave me a free cover for the phone, so now, the phone looks pretty spanking new. Well, it works, and it is good enough, yea! Another happy worm today...

      The morning is quite brilliant well, except for the faulty new "second-hand" phone. Took a bus, and surprisingly, it was a rather pleasant experience. I am seriously thinking about doing the photojournal of the place where i live - Hougang.  Oh yes! Meeting the forum people in town today, well, at least i am getting myself to get to know people again after the voluntary seclusion i put myself in. Maybe hope to get to know some friends that will remain as good friends henceforth. But that remains much to be seen for now.   Oh yes! I remember, need to get the Anti Virus Software from Moi! heh.

      Now my new "second-hand" Nokia 8850 doesn't even accept calls from other people! That's just simply brilliant. Now I've got to go down again to get it fixed, i think i will either ask for a refund or change to another phone. Sigh~ this is getting abit frustrating.

       urlLink    A picture taken in India. The little kid is salvaging food along some really old shophouses. Took a tour of the local slum in Bangalore, one of the richest city, and most advanced in India, people living in their makeshift tent, doing their sanitary outside their tent where they sleep, and make their food. These kids haven't got enough to eat everyday, and they have to work peddling rotten bananas and crackers on the dirt track where tourists will just take pictures of them. My heart goes out to these people, and pain from the fact that these people need God so much! &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp; My new "second-hand" Nokia 8850 &nbsp;   Was a spur of the moment decision to buy this phone actually, since i am looking for one as i have 2 sim cards, which one i can use on my xda for data, i am hoping to get one for phone. So in hope to lower the cost of my phone bills.   Got it at Toa Payoh, it looks ok, until i was fiddling with it in the cab, the backcover was loose. I was abit mad, until i got home, i found that the reception is having problems, and the calls kept dropping. At this time, i got real mad, and i went back to the shop, spent another 10 bucks, and got them to look at it. It was strangely, working fine when i was on my way back to the shop, and when they looked at it, i got a feeling that they might be wondering what's with this sucker with a second hand phone and complaining, afterall, it is only $120. They got it fixed, tested it out, having some minor problems with the antenna and well, i went off a less than satisfied customer. Then on the way back, the problem came back. I called them from home that i will need them to repair it or get a refund, they are pretty ok with that, so i am dropping down to Toa Payoh tomorrow lunch time. What a bloody waste of time and money! Yes, i am pissed off.   &nbsp;

      It is quite exasperating committing to a friendship where the truest intention is being questioned. I come to a shocking but a tragic conclusion that i am living in the dream world where true friendship exists. When one offers friendship, it is often accepted with the best of intentions in suspicions. That is a lesson learnt today.   Another lesson learnt, that life is all about giving, to God and to each other; when i go through life each day, without even giving the best to what i am doing, and exhibiting what christians should do, offering their selfless sacrifice, one has not live truly and has at least failed God.     "God has demonstrated his love in this, While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" Romans 5:8     This is one of my most quoted verse of the bible to my students in Sunday School, or rather ex students, whom i have fondly remembered and my prayers that they will grow up to be strong in the Lord, one who will put God first in everything they do.   All we can do, or rather all I can do, is show people Jesus, and i admit, i have no good testimony, i give up teaching, i disgrace God's name in so many times, and i am grateful that in his Grace and mercy, he forgives whenever i repent. (Another big topic to talk about -  repentance ).   O well, time to get to bed and take my medication... my heart hurts, and need to remind myself to get the medication again from the clinic...... it sucks to be so poor in health.

       urlLink     urlLink   &nbsp; Gibbon's The history of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire &nbsp;  This is one of those most read, and definitely rated one of the top 10 books to read if you are serious about history and especially in the history of Europe, Roman Empire and last but not least, Church History.   Struggled through Vol 1 so i decided to get the Abridged edition instead, was pretty much readable and have learnt alot about Roman Empire and how they have influenced much of the way of life we have today like the Army, the government and the legal system.  I think one of the main reasons why i am reading this, is having an accompaniment to my reading and study of the Church history, it is almost impossible to study that without understand the political situation where its political life is closely entwined with the church and the development of the church.   It is a lovely book, handy, and paperbacks, and maybe a good thing to read to get myself to sleep? Who knows.... this is one tough book to chew on.

Well so far, i agree, at least the original story&nbsp;by Isaac&nbsp;Asimov&nbsp;and think i got the wrong spelling, is good. But not as philosophical or deep as A.I&nbsp;by Kubrick has been.   The scripts for the show is average and i think the producer made the audience looks stupid by the long explanation of the plot at the end, but i thought it was rather sloopy.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it was a good action movie, not the usual no brainer fight, explosion and fight where the good guys won. In this show, the story has a good twist to it.   Furthermore i think this will be a good&nbsp;DVD to add to my collection later on. Nice job, but hey, at least i've got Simone out for the show, and she was complaining, well i owe&nbsp;her one artsy movies like the Return. (Prepare lots of coffee before the show otherwise they will have snores&nbsp;added to the long cheesy artsy&nbsp;conversation in the show).&nbsp;

      The Marsh Arabs of Iraq - made famous by travel writer Wilfred Thesiger, who died this week - saw their ancient way of life destroyed by Saddam Hussein. But now the dictator is gone, doubts have arisen that the former marsh dwellers even want to go back to the rushes.    &nbsp;British adventurer Wilfred Thesiger said that even as a boy he "recognised that motor transport and aeroplanes must increasingly shrink the world and irrevocably destroy its fascinating diversity".   The late author could never have imagined the role the internal combustion engine would play in the destruction of the Ma'adan - the Iraqi Marsh Arabs of the reed beds fed by the Tigris and Euphrates with whom Thesiger lived in the 1950s and about whom he wrote a hugely successful book in 1964.   Living in what some consider the region to have been the Biblical garden of Eden, the Ma'adan's simple way of life dating back 5,000 years which Thesiger had a "longing to share", was deliberately and ruthlessly extinguished by Saddam Hussein in less than a decade.  Thesiger said the marshes he knew in Iraq's south-east corner had "the stillness of a world that never knew an engine" - but in the 1990s this calm was ripped by mechanical earthmovers and attack aircraft.     &nbsp;The draining of these lands for irrigation projects elsewhere had been planned by the British rulers of Iraq long before Saddam's rise to power, and some dams had already gone up to aid Iraqi troop movements during the war with neighbouring Iran.  But the onslaught of the 1990s had nothing to do with diverting the area's watery lifeblood to benefit other Iraqis. The Sunni Muslim Saddam was punishing the Shia Marsh Arabs for their temerity to rise up against him in the aftermath of the first Gulf War.   Dykes and dams blocked the flow of water, drying up perhaps 90% of the wetlands which had once occupied around 20,000 square kilometres of southern Iraq. These sun-baked soils were then churned up by bulldozers.   Those Marsh Arabs not compelled to flee by the loss of the fish, reeds and water buffalo on which their livelihoods depended were subjected to "heavy artillery, fire bombs and even strafing", according to a 1992 United Nations report.    &nbsp;An estimated 200,000 people fled or were driven from their ancestral homes - some across the border to camps in Iran, others into Iraq's towns, where they faced continued hardships and discrimination.   And yet still the desiccated marshes remained a centre of grim armed resistance to the Ba'ath party regime.   Iraqi guerrilla fighter Abu Hattem - a man who locally won legendary status to rival Robin Hood - waged what he has since called "The War of the Fleas" against Saddam's superior forces across the salty wastes of the once fertile marshes.   The thousand or so Marsh Arabs who rallied to his cause are credited with inflicting some humiliating defeats on the Iraqi army and, during the recent US-led war, even liberated nearby towns days before invading Coalition forces swept up from neighbouring Kuwait.     &nbsp;Though they acted as his refuge for more than 10 years, what does Abu Hattem want for marshes now? "This period of our lives in the marshes is over," he recently told reporters. "The marshes will not be part of our new agenda."   The parched lands are slowly being flooded once again - with Saddam's regime unwittingly setting the ball rolling in its dying days by accidentally blowing up a dam while trying to destroy roads that the British might use in their attack on Iraq's second city, Basra.   Baroness Emma Nicholson, founder of the London-based charity Assisting Marsh Arabs and Refugees (Amar), says this breached dam is one of five new sources of water routed in to help rejuvenate the marshes since the British occupied the area.   Fish and reeds (from which the Ma'adan fashion their distinctive buildings) are already returning, she says.   However, some reporters and aid workers in southern Iraq have cast doubts about the eagerness of some Ma'adan to resume their old ways, particularly those Marsh Arabs who have found life closer to town to their liking.    &nbsp;"[They] have tasted the modern world and they don't want to let go of it," said one Basra representative of the International Organisation for Migration.   But Baroness Nicholson, a regular visitor to the region, says the desire to return to fishing and water buffalo farming remains strong in the majority of cases.   "Not everyone wants to be a farmer or fisherman - and we will help those who do not. But not even Saddam could break the will and spirit of the Marsh Arabs. That is way he had to continually fight them."   A recent census seems to support this view of Ma'adan stubbornness. Some 85,000 people are still thought to dwell in the marshes despite their sorry state - more than twice the number previously thought.    Baroness Nicholson is sure many more will flock back as Amar pushes to improve health care and schooling in the marshes - something Saddam also starved the region of. The situation is "complex", she admits. An understatement, perhaps.   Firstly, the UN already says it is being careful not to show the Ma'adan preferential treatment for fear of stoking local resentment against the Marsh Arabs. And secondly, not all the dams restricting water supply to the wetlands were built by Saddam - Turkey and Syria take water from the rivers which could feed the marshes again.  Also, doubts remain that all of the marshes can be successfully flooded, particularly since the UN that estimated prior to Saddam's fall he had pushed the ecosystem to the very brink of collapse.  Baroness Nicholson is undaunted. "What one man can do, another man can undo."    urlLink From BBC

      After having trouble sleeping, the morning has been astonishly good. Had a good bath, although the walk to the bus stop and to work has been very uncomfortable with the humidity and the heat, it is still a good start to the day.   In all cases, i missed out taking some shots of this nice path that i walk past every morning, it is nice, with the low hanging of the trees that shelter the pathway, and in certain season of the year, it's fragrance of the blossoming of the flowers fill the pathway, making every walk as though it is through an enchanted forest.   Enchanted or not, it is sure a pleasant experience. Till later, damn, i am still having some stomachache. Time to get medicated.

      I wrote this in my previous blog before, but now, taking 15 mins to chase back those times past, i can't help but feel aggrieved that so much has come and gone and the many friendships, be it, superficial or deep, have all, but disappeared and has left behind half empty heart that will stay with me till the day I give an account to God.  Can friendship last? The very question that every young kids will ask, well at least i did ask myself that, I don't know. Till today, i am still trying to figure out that. Seriously, simone once said, i was so different, she has lots of friends and she can't go on in life without friends, and i am the exact opposites, i survive without friends, has been without for a long time, maybe that's bad, i do not know, but at least i can avoid disappointing people or get disappointed. Think sometimes, i really do hope there is a group of friends, or rather a few, that i can be totally comfortable with. I do not think i have that group and it hurts to think i have no friends, or no one really count me as a friend.  Hey! Is this friendship thing carried too far off now? Hmmm, am i being overwhelmed by the all good good friendship how i miss it thing? Manz! I miss those times spent in church, in the basketball court, at macdonalds playing chess pooling together coins to get a packet of fries, playing hide and seek underground at the basement, all the youth camps i've been on, all the fun times at sunday school outings, the camp at sembawang, the 10 years or so friendship where we see each other from primary school, to secondary school to tertiary education and some now, married, others have passed on to meet God.   Maybe it is true, i am really not worth a friend to have; and i pray that even in this lonely walk, i can explain to simone how i really feel at times, except that she doesn't really understand what i am going through. Somethings are just meant to be taken and kept inside... and those will stay there.

      Today has been a rather fruitful day, finishing half of the project at work and finding faithfulness in God's providence and last but not least, have had a good time with Simone. We had a good time watching a DVD and watching MTV figuring out all the hip pops on the TV.   Although I had a bad stomachache, i totally enjoyed the night. Simone has been very nice, especially all her smiles and laughters, and even though she had quite a shitty day at home, she never fails me to impress me with her well of happiness that's deep in her, that she has yet to realise that unless she finds the well of joy and gladness from God, it will run out and the emptiness of depression will soon follows.  All my heart now pray that she will learn how to put God first, and it is only in the refuge of God's immerse grace and mercy that she will finally place her total trust in, that no one can hurt her anymore, that she will not suffer her parents.   &nbsp;

I am thankful I can move about freely and express my beliefs,  There are those who live in constant fear.   I am thankful I have been loved,  There are those for whom no one has ever cared.   I am thankful I can work  There are those who have to depend on others for even their most basic needs   I am thankful to wake up in the morning and take a deep breath of fresh air.  There are those who never got that far   I am thankful for the opportunity to help others  There are those who have not been so abundantly bessed as I

      A nice lunch with compliments from Kui, our new senior manager in the department. Well yes, a pinch of sour grapes, but now regretting those irky yellow greenish monster feelings i felt, and yes, i should be happy for the achievements other people has. Such, is what a Christian suppose to do, not festering ill envies and jealousy.  In an attempt to appear repented, i happily indulged myself in the gorgeous nice food at PaoSin, a peranakan restaurant at the gardens. Most important of all, yes, it is free. Such bliss.   Now back in office, God reminded me of something in the bible. Let me turn to it.... ok, i can't find it, but i vaguely remember, be happy for others when they are doing good. That, is a light rebuke from God for what i was feeling, but thank God for them.   And yes, think i am so out of touch with God's words, my bible's turning mouldy and time for me to get back and dig at it daily, and renew my love for God's words.  Aidios!

      The central theme of the continuous struggle in my christian walk this week will again be on the subject of holiness.   Faced with some conflicting theological differences in one of the discussions with a friend from another church, that i cannot help but notice that there is a general misconception on the subject of holiness and a christian's role and duties to living a life that's set apart for God.   I read 1 Peter 1:13 to 2:4 today    Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be self controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do, for it is written, "Be holy, because I am holy."   Since you call on a Father who judges each man's wrk impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear. For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. Through Him you believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.   Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from the heart. For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring Word of God. For all men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall but the Word of the Lord stands forever."   And this is the word that was preached to you. Therefore, rid of yourselves of all malice, and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      It was one of the nicest weekends I have spent with someone really super duper special, even thought it was one of the seemingly boring thing to do, visiting museums. But it is not the place or things, but the companionship right? Think Simone is the most beautiful and sweetest girl around  We went to Asian Civillisation Museum and spent the entire afternoon there, and frankly, it was an unforgetable afternoon, looking at the different cultures and spending time together. Then we went to enjoy a cuppa Hot Chocolate and some nice chocolate.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;       Isn't she beautiful? Took this along Singapore River. Yes she always wear this really fantastic smile and it just make me want to hold and protect her forever.

      Many times, i am being confronted with the question of where my priorities are. Is it God first or others first before God? It was only last monday at Jacob's teaching conference, a statement has particularly struck me, and reminded me of something I've taught in my sunday school before "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also".   That's the easiest and clearest way to measure a man, and the easiest compass for my spiritual life, am i leading a life after God's heart, or am i simply flirting with the world. Many times, i have to confess, i am flirting with the world, on one leg, i am of the world, enjoying the wines, etc, on the other, trying to balance my faith and my thirst for God. Let me say that i was so wrong. I cannot be lukewarm, neither can i flirt with both and expect to pull through.   I have to choose today, whom i shall serve, myself or God, the World or God? I will follow God wholeheartedly, it is hard, but i pray that each day, i will continue to abide in His Word, that through His Mercy, that I may find it all worthwhile, at the end of the day, i will want to stand before God and hear Him says, "Well Done, my faithful servant".   I can only serve my master wholeheartedly..... i pray.

      Lots of people got promoted today, and of course, i am not one of them. I do not think anyone in my dept got promoted as we are too small, and our contributions to the entirety of the company is insignificance.   A thought just crossed my mind that I should seriously start looking at other job opportunities since now that the economy is starting to pick up, and more jobs are generated, although I might have to start now and hopefully get a job by end of December after i've gotten my AWS.   &nbsp;

      The 2 days changed my perspective in life more than any other events about Christianity - I will make an entry in my Christian Faith Blog.   I am tired, physically from the ordeal of rushing to the bible teaching classes at Novena and returning home late every night, but I guess it is worth the time. This week at work seems to be abit dull, and slow, with nothing to show for except some minor projects; i hated this time wasting and inertia which always leave me itching for actions.   &nbsp;

I guess i am abit chattier, and crazier when i have alcohol. That's bad. My first in a few years drinking more than 1 glass. Anyway, we missed out on the lucky draw... damn. haha. Simone is still sore about it, we missed out on a $1500 DVD home theater system cos she wanted to go for a walk instead of hanging out at the ball room. Oh well, we went home early because we were quite tired.

      while i was having lunch at the office cafeteria, i heard "Above all" from the Drinks stall. Boy, i didn't know the lady owning the stall is a christian. Cool. Always thought she is quite boorish with the guy's style of outlook like short hair, guys' dressings and all. But i guess i have made an unfair judgement on the person's appearance rather than looking at the person for who she is. Gee. I feel guilty now.  But well, thank God for the chastisement. Like i say, a pleasant surprise and a lesson on humility and teachability.

      Was reading on church history where the Christianity as a state was splitted into two, namely the eastern greek orthodoxy and the western christianity. Both factions are the result of men's sinfulness and the crave for power rather than the love for God.  The western christianity manifested in the eventual manifestation of the Pope and the Roman Catholic, started thinking their is the Apostle Peter's lineage where Christ promised to build the rock on. That's wrong, Jesus said He will build the Church on the rock, not Peter, but Jesus, who is the eternal rock of our salvation. Peter was only subjecting himself under the authority of Jesus and recognize who he is. The historical foundation of the Western Christianity was ugly and wrong as it is. Pope is not the head of the Church, Jesus is! Pope has no power over whose sins to forgive anymore than you and me, the only one who can forgive sins is Jesus!  The eastern greek orthodox churches are a myriad of christianity mixed with paganism with icons worshipping and they seems to justify that! Bible plainly spoken, Worship no GRAVEN IMAGES and have NO OTHER GODS before HIM! How the "Churches" have fallen into idolatry!!! No matter how John Mansur justifies it, the plain fact remains, it is the very sin Israel has fallen into when they worship the Golden Calf instead of the One True God!  My heart ached to learn of how deep these people in the past has fallen who bears the name of Jesus, and some are still blindly following these faith. Some may advocate religious tolerance, and yes, i respect them but not necessarily i agree with their faith. My faith is rooted in the fact that Jesus is the Son of God, only he is the head of the church, only Jesus has the authority to forgive sins, and Jesus will come again!  I remembered again Jeff's exhortation, that we must always look back at history and learn from the lessons the church, just like God rebuked Israel time and time again to look back at how God delivered Israel from Egypt, and how God has smittened the nations in Canaan for Israel's sake. Remembering God's faithfulness even tho the Church has forsaken God. It is time people of God, to turn back to God, repent and begin to walk in obedience to the Word of God!

      Time has come and gone.....  The first day in the kindergarten, getting excited to meet friends yet, peeping at the windows looking out for some familiar faces.  Primary school was a time of unforgetable fun with "one leg", "catching", brushing teeth with the red mug along the drain, and not forgetting chinese spellings! O what a torture.  Secondary School was cool, jumping from ecas to ecas and finally stopping at squash and audio visual club. Met some nice friends from other schools like St Theresa Convents, Catholic High, Methodist Girls and Christine Xie from St Anthony's Convent.  All these while, my friendship with Jenn and the gang, namely Zhiguang, Wei Kurk, Peter, and other people grew in Sunday School. It was in this time, i started to grow serious with God. Some of the people have influenced my faith mainly, Bro Dennis, Bro Edwin, Bro Michael, and last but not least, Bro Paul.  O where has time gone to? Those, have came and passed... it has slipped past forever through our grasp.

      Well now... 20 minutes more to "off work" then, should one actually look forward to getting off work? Does that mean anything bad to the employee? I guess it depends on the philosophy of the bosses.  For a job oriented one, as long as Projects can completed in time, work gets done, hour committed to work in the office is flexible. Some however adhered strictly to the hours stipulated in the company's modus operandis.  I guess for myself, i've done what i need to do today and confident that I'll complete the project, so i guess that gave me the ease of mind to go off work. Then i won't have a guilty conscience wouldn't i? heh. O well. Sticking to the Ethos "Do everything as if it is doing for God" wouldn't go far wrong would it?

      The cleaner uncle just got another assistant! I can't believe it. Now instead of snoring away after lunch, they are chatting loudly the whole day, their subjects of conversation varies from what happened during the japanese occupation, the usual national gossip about accidents, the Nichol Highway problems, the merits and faults of the government etc etc. Used to get annoyed with the uncle's snorings, now the noise is getting louder. Not to mention that his cubicle has become a personal office with junks stacked so high that can just blocked off the ceiling light! *Yes i am exaggerating, but the truth is, ain't far from it*.  What should i do? Go to the HR and make this issue known or just blast the music on my computer or stuff my ear with music from ipod!?

      Had a tough time dragging myself off the bed to get ready for work! Well finally 10 mins before 9, i got to the toilet to wash up! sigh~  While was walking to the bus stop again, i am beginning to dread the day. The weather is unbelievably humid and hot, i can hardly breathe. The heavy bag which i am carrying does not help either. Got on the wrong bus, and wasted at least 5 minutes. While on that stupid bus, there was this indian working in LTA sleeping on the seat closer to the window and his bag was on his side! There wasn't any other empty seat, i felt like giving him a shake and ask him to be more considerate and not act like as if he owns the bus even tho he works for LTA!  Fortunately, some guy got off at the next bus stop and i took the seat. Made some arrangements to meet Simone for lunch at the Indonesian coffee shop and hopefully she will get her allowance by then. While walking to the office, suddenly the Ethos "Do everything as if it is for God" brought to my mind! I felt guilty about my approach to my work, to my duties to God in reading His Word. I prayed for forgiveness for several things like my sloppy attitude, and several fallings into temptations that no matter how i justify it, it is still Sin.  O well, now, i am in office, will try to read the bible... still thinking if i should go to the Bible studies or the gatherings tonight...

      Just heard from Simone that some guy from New Creation Church just said a bunch of bullshit to a friend of hers and all those bullshits have irritated this friend and at the same time, cast some doubts on Christianity! When i heard that, i was angered that such mishandling of God's words (all the mambo jumbo about Once Saved forever save, and HE (the guy) will save her), is simply frustrating, and all the more confirm the suspicion of the credibility of New Creation Church.  O well, i pray that i too will not fall in the same way in as the christians at New Creation. I have to take heed to Jeff's advice on staying humble and be teachable. I think that's some wise words, as a Christian, we are commanded to live a humble and obedience lives, and only staying teachable like clay, we will be able to be moulded by the Potter's hand.

      Simone had another quarrel with her mum again, and this time, it is another meaningless incident of argument of which both parties have failed to find restrain to their runaway senses. Listening to her pouring her woes on the phone, just made me realised sometimes i too, have failed to restrain my runaway sensibility.  How did Apostle Paul do it? I mean, keeping focused on his godly perspective through the storms in his life - persecution, shipwrecked, stonings etc. It seems that this man of God, have it all wrapped up nicely in his faith. I remembered Jeff mentioning yesterday at the JFN aftermath talk, about Paul. How did that man do it? Despite the hardship, he continues to Rome knowing that a certain death awaits him, but it is not just the steadfastness, but the joy he possessed, is just beyond any human understanding.  How can I keep focused on my perspective? Despite the job stresses, the demands of a relationship, the burden of the worldly restrains, and the commitment of a pilgrim on this christian journey, how do i find joy and steadfast pace in this walk? Can i cry? Sure. Jesus offered his shoulder, i am sure.....  I can only so far, point it down to the Word of God. The Word of God is life to those who've been entrusted with it, it is a light to our path, and refuge in times of trouble. While the world will fade away one day, but this Word of God will remain, such eternity and steadfast solidarity of its existence. Why would I look elsewhere except to God!  All these quarrels, rejection, hurts, anger, happiness, stress, and weariness will pass away one day, such is the temporal state of who we are, for we are like the morning dew, will evaporate when the sun rises again in the morning, how can we the frail humanity do, except to which God has mercifully extended his grace and love for us! O God, teach me to live a life that's pleasing to you, and one who will handle the Word of God with reverence and love! Write your precepts on this heart of mine that i will live by your laws and by your power which the Holy Spirit will empower me to be an instrument for you to work through. Teach me your precepts, and show me your heartbeat, to tell others about your love for them, and to teach your precepts that when I pass away one day, that people will see you working through my life.  O a morning started with "everything gone wrong" to a day filled with fear of God! Is this how Paul gained his unchanging perspective in his stormy life by focusing on you? I like that....

      I had a thought while writing to a colleague earlier about writing in a blog be it non fiction or fiction, that sometimes reading a non fiction blog allows one to see through the eyes of the author regarding the world around him or her. Then suddenly it occurs to me, that we all need to look at the world through the eyes of Jesus. One of the ways to do that, is read Jesus' Blog which is the bible! Time for me to seriously see the world through Jesus' eyes!

      While walking to the bus stop this morning, was thinking of temptation. How can a christian resist temptations? A few verses came to mind from my younger days at Sunday School, but i failed to put together a sensible and biblical answer to that except the fragments of ideas gathered from the past years of sunday school.  This particular verse was so often misquoted that without examining it, seems to be good for resisting temptation - James 4:7, Submit yourself to God, resist the Devil and he will flee from you. But looking at it in context, has almost nothing to say to temptation.  I believe when a Christian says the sinners prayer, he is born again into a new nature and put on the righteousness of Christ, as such, we have 2 natures, one spiritual where we are renewed into Christ's righteousness through his death and this is only possible through faith, second, is our flesh, the nature where we were all born into this world - carnal, prone to sinful gratification; these 2 natures are always in conflicts and are fighting for control of our life.  In Romans 6, Paul wrote "dead to sin, alive in Christ" clearly showed us the Christian approach to facing the temptations within us. We need to come each day to a decision of whom we shall serve - Romans 6:14 says, "For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace". We need to recognize that we are not our own, but are bought by the blood of Christ, and in this acknowledgement, we failed to live for ourselves, but for God.  But that will not stop us from falling in our temptations. Further down the scriptures, the principle of the 2 natures are shown that which nature we submit ourselves determines how we live our lives. In Romans 8, living in the flesh when we crave after earthly pleasures, treasures on earth, where we sought to feed our flesh, we submit ourselves to the sinful nature. No, I am not advocating total abstinence on things on earth like work, playing good music, but i am saying where our heart is, there our treasure will be. But Paul exhort us to live in the nature of our renewed life, the Spirit. Obedience to God's words and by the power of the Holy Spirit who empowers us to understand God's words and living it out in our daily lives, and by this very submission to God's power, we are able to find freedom from the bondages of sin and temptation.  Last but not least, Romans 12:2, Paul urges us to offer ourselves as living sacrifice , holy and pleasing to God which is our spiritual act of worship. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - his good, pleasing and perfect will.  STOP conforming to the world, but by transformed by the renewing of your mind! - Only one thing that can renew our mind, that's God's word!!! We have been brainwashed by the media, the fallen world's idea of morality, etc, and it has become our nature, now! we need to be brainwashed again, not by MTV but by God's words that we will begin to write them on the tablets of our heart and start to live by the Word of God!

      From Micah 6:1-8, God wants His people to live lives that measure up to His moral and ethical standards. Through faith in Christ's death, not good works, God graciously saves us from the penalty of sin and makes peace with us. But that's not the end of the story, He saves us so that we might do good deeds that exhibit God's character (Eph 2:8-10). He wants us to treat others fairly and compassionately; he wants us to live humble, obedient lives!     Micah 6:8 "He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.

      How many times have I been guilty with failing to live to the statement "Do it all for the glory of God"! I do well for the things I love to do, but when comes to the chores of the daily grinds of working life, every single tasks and projects is like a 10-tonne boulder and i am just dragging my feet around. That's so wrong.  Dear God, forgive me for taking your Word lightly!

         The Four Agreements      Be Impeccable With Your Word    Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.     Don’t Take Anything Personally    Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.     Don’t Make Assumptions  Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.     Always Do Your Best  Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.    A   urlLink  book    by Don Miguel Ruiz

      Lots of things happened over the weekend, like Sonicfest, and the after thoughts to it. Had a talk with Simone during and after the session and personally, i felt Sonicfest has not been as successful as it should be; While saying this, the event might be a success, but the young people will walked out of the event unchanged.  Saw a few young chaps dancing, headbanging, and mooshing away, and i thought, boy, these guys sure have a passion for rock n roll *Peace sign*, and all they demonstrated that day, is their love for the world, for the music, and for themselves. I do not see God through those young people. I stood there in undisguised shock of the first few bands beginning with Gloria to a few after that, they do seems have good themes for their songs like Racism, and all, but first, i do not know what they are singing and second, what has that got to do with God?  I felt a sense of sorry for myself that i see throngs of young people in the festival enjoying themselves immensely with the music, emo and all, but do they love God and God's words as well? I sighed with relief when Gordon announced that next Sonicfest, they will be incorporating Conferences, teaching session, which i think it is a good direction the Sonicfest is moving at.  Sunday was great, went to church, went for a good meal at Adams Rd Hawker Centre and then to Plaza Singapura. Wanted to check out the guitar bag for my Cort, but the shops were closed, and well, went home and took a great nap! yea!
