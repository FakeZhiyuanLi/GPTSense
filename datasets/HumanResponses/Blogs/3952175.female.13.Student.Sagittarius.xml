      I agree, it totally drives me mad at times.. but we managed to finish the cooking with like 10 more mins to spare.. the other groups were cooking for very long..bet they put in effort.. us too wad.. aniwae.. i think the fried rice is ok lah.. it is considered quite nice, except for the fact that there is a smell, a very veggie smell.. which i hate alot.. i mean hu likes it.. so anyway..the rice can be considered successful..  the pizza, was such a great hit! every1 keeps coming back for more.. it is like nvr ending.. but then.. we only have 16 pieces.. so there isn't much to go around.. the desserts ok.. just that we put it into the container when the choco haven't harden.. so the choco flow out and took the shape of the container.. the drink is the worst.. we added too much skimmed milk and too much ice..  So anyway.. it is finally finished.. we no need to worry bout our cooking.. we just hafta worry bout our toy presentation..
