      Well, well, well.... we meet again. Since all my Friday night plans are shot to shit, I think I might as well spend some quality time on here bitching about whatever the fuck comes to mind. Haha... I'm really a chill person... but this thing is just great to be able to get stuff off your mind and let loose. So please, don't think I am some whiny bastard that has nothing but problems in his life, cuz I am not. I just believe in getting rid of all my insecurities and baggage by means of this public domain so I don't let em loose on some unsuspecting female who I am trying to get to know. Anyhow, that being said... let the games begin!   Fridays suck. Well, they really don't unless you are stuck with nothing to do... but are great b/c it is the end of the work week for me... though not the end for some of you unfortunate souls out there and I apologize if I revell in the fact that I now have the next two days off, before the start of another grueling work week at my "wonderful" job. Yes I am being facetious, but it truly is a jekell and hyde place of work for me... one minute I am having fun, the next minute it sucks monkey nuts... But at least there are good looking girls to look at, which makes it somewhat easier. Oh and I am allowed to look... no girl has claimed me yet. If there is one out there who wishes to do so... she must be HERE or at least willing to get HERE somehow, someway.... and as much as possible, cuz I am slowly dying here. I know it sounds cheesy but I just want a girl to hold. You may think that I only want some booty from my last post, but that isn't me at all. Yes, it would be nice... but that isn't what I am all about. And even if I talk to girls, I am not always after them for that... FOR THOSE OF YOU GUYS OUT THERE WHO ARE READING THIS AND ARE LIKE HUH? I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING.... you are small minded nimwits who only care about the holiest of holes... girls who are friends are just as good too. But don't get me wrong, if there is a possibility for something with any of those friends, I will go for it... b/c why the hell not, what the fuck do I have to lose??? I can't sink any lower.   Okay, enough wallowing in self pity... Fuck that shit. I just need to say what needed to be said thats all. I am sick of when I say shit such as above and ppl are like... dude all you are doing is trying to get someone to feel sorry for you. Well I got two words for those morons. FUCK THAT. And how about you bend over so I can shove my boot directly up your CANDYASS! I reserve the right to discuss in a somewhat sorrowful manner of my discontents and misfortunes in the dating world. I am not seeking anyones pity or words of "i'm sorry dude," but rather some understanding of those who actually give a shit about me and show that they give a shit about me. Frankly, I hear enough from them as it is, that they should in fact listen to me once in awhile. I don't do it often, but when I do, they must be prepared to listen for a few cuz I usually let loose a tidal wave of crap I keep bottled up. That is why I have a feeling this post might be my first EPIC post since I started posting on here. And believe it or not... it is 10:30 PM and I havent had shit to eat since like 4... I rushed home from work at 8:40 and thought I was going out, but nope I got home too late... despite ignoring everyone at work, being rude to those who asked me what time I thought we would be getting out because I was so focused on getting out on time so I could go hang out. Which is retarded because I didnt end up going out anyway! Goddamn, the tangled webs we weave. I don't even know why I am suprised. Nothing works out for me... I repeat NOTHING... well that isnt really true... it just seems like it sometimes... haha... not that it is a big deal anyway... I am having a fuckin blast typing away on this post. wait... is that what I think it is? It is! Sounds of Grand theft auto 3... my roomate just fuckin bought the GTA3 and Vice City double pack... haha thats my night... plus some rich greenery I just happen to have at my disposal. That will certainly take my mind off of things for a good long while.   Ok time to put on some music... hmmm what shall it be? the dead? string cheese incident? the disco biscuits? max creek? phish? the list goes on and on... hmmm some floyd... haha just downloaded this show from 88... I will have to give it a good listen after I get nice. Anyway, I will be right back. I really need to eat. The rest of me wants food to GET IN MY BEEELLY... haha... grilled cheese time... 2nd night in a row. I guess that means it is time to go grocery shopping dont ya think? Haha... well it is now 11:30 PM and I have finished eating. I can't believe it is this late. The paradox begins because I am unsure whether to go to sleep early tonight or stay up late. Decisions, decisions, decisions... sigh I hate making decisions.. I guess it is because I hate committing to something when I know I probably don't want to do it anyway! Alright... I'll flip a coin... shit, it went under the bed... I'm too lazy to go get it... so fuck it. I'm staying up late!     we have interupted this regularly scheduled broadcast to bring you this special report.... YES LADIES AND GENTLEMAN... GREG HAS A GIRLFRIEND, I REPEAT GREG HAS A GIRLFRIEND.... probably didnt think the day would ever come... good for you Greg, now would you please shut up about her. Thank you!    Sooooooooooooooooooooo it is now 3:17 am... big f'in time gap eh? well I've been busy. Sorry about that. If it wasn't so late I would stay up and finish this post. It really sucks b/c I had alot more to say, but am so tired that it would be pointless for me to try and fight sleep in order to write some more. Not so  epic a post after all... I was a bit hasty when I made that assumption based upon what was floating around inside my head earlier. Nevertheless, I will be sure to keep updating on this thing so as to not forget anything good to talk about. That being said, I am going to pass out now, I hope you all understand... all 5 of you that is... haha... so like always im out quicker than it took MLB to official state that tonights contest between the first place in the AL East 15 win Boston Red Sox versus the tied for first in the AL West Texas Rangers was postponed.... game start time 8:05 PM... official cancellation statement approximately 11:30 PM... someone fell asleep somewhere...  which is what I am about to do in this chair if I don't get my ass into bed... PEACE...

      I'm baaaaaaaack... yes yes I hear the discontent... you know what? quit yer bitchin! haha in all seriousness, I've been too fuckin busy to post lately. If it is not one thing, it is something else. Or really I could be bullshitting you and have been extremely fuckin lazy...  I guess you could say it has been a little of both. Add in some stress of still being in that damn club. Sigh... I know and I am sorry that I harp on it so much. You would think I was in the club of people who didn't realize they had won the lottery and threw out their ticket. But the reason I bring it up once again is kind of what my title of this blog alludes to... who makes up the fuckin rules regarding these things? Is there someone out there who picks numbers out of a hat or numbered balls like in the damn lottery and that indicates who gets some ass at that moment? Or who COULD potential get ass in the NEAR future? Even though that person may be a bumbling idiot when it comes to chicks and stumbles upon a situation that he didn't have to do shit to get into? Oh and I'm always the friend who has other friends get girls and then have to listen to them babble on and on 24-7 about their girls like they are the reincarnation of Helen of Troy or something. Okay, when you have told me a story 5 times... it gets O..L..D.. if you didn't catch that I said OLD! I especially don't want to hear about your bedroom escapades either. Or if you are like "Vlady" (see my brothers  post, http://shabs0283.blogspot.com/ ), at your now girlfriends place of employment. Not that they are doing the horizontal polka or anything yet, but various other "activities." Sorry, it's more INFO THAN I NEEDED TO KNOW! Also, I don't need a day to day, play by play account of everything that goes on. I know it is now the #1 thing on your mind, but have some fuckin curtiousy (sp?)... once all of us have escaped our current dilemmas... then and ONLY then, will I be willing or in any kind of state to give a shit whatosever about what you have to say about your respective significant other.   What kind of justice is that? I know I am a stubborn bastard and have trouble approaching girls in certain situations and being able to start a conversation. So it's really my own damn fault for having gone so long without! If they approach me, I have no problem conversing, but I'm no supermodel, so it's not like I have tons of girls crowding around me to talk to me or what not. So I usually take what I can get. And frankly, I have been very lucky to have dated some nice girls... shit never works out in the long run, but I'm fortunate for the experiences, believe me. I know it sounds crazy, but it is better off to be hurt once, then not hurt at all. I seem to find myself in situations that are out of my control and it's not that I want to control every minute aspect of each of them. I just want some fuckin resolution, so I don't have to sit here in constant limbo. It's like let's skip to the fuckin chase. Yes or no. Now or later. What the fuck are we doing here, holding our respective pieces, until someone makes the gesture? Who the fuck knows. And its not like I have anyone here to even attempt anything with! There could be... but thats the fucked up part! This is my luck... and it sucks...  But far too often it just seems like nothing ever works out for me in this regard so it's like why bother. I'm sick of putting forth efforts that land me back at square one all the time.    Beeeeeeeeeeeooooop...This is your regularly scheduled test of the Emergency Broadcast System... this is only a test. Beeeeeeeeeeooooooooop!   hey hey hey hey smoke weed everyday...   -===##~~~  You should learn at least one thing everyday. I learned today, that no matter how shitty things may seem in a certain aspect of ones life... or for those of you who have multiple shitty aspects, things will always get better with time, just have to keep being patient (dammit!)... and if you are a Red Sox fan... enjoy this moment because the Yankees won't suck all season. Haha! Sweep baby! Get out your brooms!   So yes all of that was completely random, but I needed to find a way to get off that subject, one which drives me absolutely nuts, but I don't get too worked up over b/c it is not worth it. I just needed to vent about it once again.  Anyway I have hit the end of my rope this evening so I will bow out and finsh this another time.

      Hello, good morning, good evening and good night... Whats going on???? It's been a few since I posted and figured today would be good as any to throw down once more! So... it has been an interesting last few days. Had a pretty decent weekend I must say... two in a row, I must be on a streak or something! Saturday night... first f'in night it was warm enough to chill OUTSIDE on the deck, ALL night! We drank, we smoked, we played drinking games, we laughed, we smoked and drank some more, told some great f'in stories, laughed alot at my roomate Amit's expense and this acquaintance of ours (ummm... Donny)'s  derelictions in a certain community, and generally just chilled out for the first time in awhile... glad to see everything was in alignment that night! Perfect weather, the stars were out, and it began the pattern of warmer temperatures we've been enjoying for the last couple of days and nights... ahh can't wait until that is everyday for the next couple of months! Anyway moving on... so today is 4/20... yes Hitler's birthday (thanks for the info Rob)... very disturbing. A celebration for us POTHEADS, but also a day which saw the birth of that monster? Very disturbing, indeed.  Also as my brother Rob has just informed me over AIM, it is also the day that saw the Columbine shootings... what kind of crazy coincidence is that???  Rob puts it best - Shabs0283 (11:46:33 PM): it went from a stoners holiday to some kind of sick perversion... that illustrates it beautifully... anyway moving on yet again... I was in such a funk these past couple of days... mainly started Friday night after I got home, but since then only on and off... tho I've been in a great mood,  every so often I get bogged down... damn club! wait... forget I said that, there is no "club". But in all honesty, I think I just need someone here with me... or maybe just some lovin' or both and I'll be good as new (ok not just some, but alot if possible). It certainly has been awhile... no I am not going to tell you exactly how long its been. I feel pathetic really. As much as it does, the long absense, though extremely annoying and errrr frustrating, hasn't all been bad. But I will not bore you with those insignificant reasons, few as they may be. Haha... moving right along at a furiously brisk pace... leaving all that moronic rambling in the rearviewmirror. I am comfortably relaxing, listening to Phish... American Airlines Arena Miami, FL 12-29-03.. 2nd of the 4 show run last New Years... very good shit... downloaded all four shows in one shot! And yes, legally. So I should be set for a while. Well, I think I have reached the end of this particular post. I just hit a rut and figured before I got too stuck I'd end things on a good note and bow out for the evening. Gotta run... I'm out quicker than the truth there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq... I mean who f'in knows these days... sigh... I hope we don't lose any more soldiers in this whole mess. SUPPORT THE TROOPS NOT THE WAR! PEACE   "I woke to the world one morning did not really know what was going on Didn't care about tomorrow worry when tomorrow comes I went outside that night set the ole imagination a flight   For one second I felt like a kid on Christmas day feeling stops all if I said in a word I will explain if I may   I climed up a tree that night Sat up in the branches and I felt just like a bird it was the best feeling in the world   Felt so good that night my soul it seemed to fly around that night as I flew that night   For one second I felt like a bird hangin' up in the air feelin' stops all if I said in a word the feeling to be without a care   Swam in the sea that night dove through the waves and I felt like a fish it was the best feeling in the world   Felt so good that night my soul it seemed to swim around that night as I swam that night   For one second I Felt like a fish cruising around in the sea, the feeling stops all if I said in a word the feeling to be free"  "Best Feeling" by Keller Williams

      rain... it sucks! well its good for the water supply and for plants... but other than that... haha you know what im talking about and i dont even have to say it! let's just say im hoping for a break this weekend... please someone make it stop??? lol ok enough whining for me on that subject!   ok so what shall i talk about this fine evening. having already enjoyed some rich greenery and my first viewing of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol 1, i am now relaxing in my chair... which is damn comfortable right now, thank you very much! damn the red sox, rained out again... i guess that is the only way to keep us out of first place... hmmm then its def going to be a long season, indeed!   moving right along... i cant wait for summer btw... yes i'll admit it. i know it will arrive soon enough, but honestly if i rolled out of bed tomorrow and it was summer i'd be very happy about it... im going to make the most of this summer.. not like last summer which was half assed.... not that it wasnt a fuckin blast and a half, but i felt like i didnt do half as much as i should of and complained about not doing twice as more twice as much! since i work in pretty much a prison... there being no windows whatsoever in any A and F store in any mall i visit to work at, i will be spending as much of my free time outside as possible! speaking of outside, i think its time i got some fresh air and perhaps a cig.. ;o)~   Shabs77 has been idle for 15 minutes    ok im back... where was i? i lost my train of thought... ding! "marijuana affects the memory" ok ok so maybe this wasnt the best night to write a post. im just trying to get on a regular pattern here so i can offer up bits here and there... but i dont think i have anything clever to say tonight! so sorry to disappoint and keep everyone waiting! i promise i will come on here better prepared in the future! im out quicker than the celtics will be in this years NBA playoffs (and i'm a C's fan!) peace........................       the number you have dialed is not in service, please hang up and try your call again........... .................

      WHAT UP, WHAT UP? It is I, the Dark Lord of the Sith... haha ummm what am I doing and where am I??? I think my real brain has shut down for the evening... Damn 12 hr shifts at work... whew it was another long one today... but fuck it! UCONN WON THE NCAA MENS CHAMPIONSHIP BABY!!! The UConn Women have a chance tomorrow at Tennessee... should be exciting! If they do pull it out, then UConn will be the first school to have both a men's and women's champion in the same year!!! KICK ASS! Now we have baseball to look forward to and what a year it is going to be!!! GO RED SOX! Ok enough on sports... life is good, I guess... work sucks, but what kind of work doesnt in some way or another? I guess the work you don't really have to call work... Oh it is going to be a rough week... I hope to get out alive... well at least breathing and in good enough condition to see Max Creek this Friday (YES APRIL 9TH!) at the Webster Theater in Hartford... anyone want to go??? Please??? haha... I hate going to shows alone, though I havent ever done it so how could I hate it??? We'll get back to that later... but I want to go on a tangent first... so speaking of going alone to events... I always used to rag on this kid Nathan for going to movies alone... something which I could never do... cuz who do u have to talk about the movie to, after you see it?? That would suck if I had no one to completely analzye and dissect a movie with after the credits start rollin on down the screen and we have barely escaped the massive rush to the exits by the crowd who for whatever reason has to get out as quickly as possible without any consideration for whomever is below them on the stairs... Seriously... i know there are people out there who think on these lines... I mean I didnt hear a fire alarm or anything... maybe there is a buy one get one free meal deal at Denny's or something... crying out loud. Ok let's go on another tangent... why is it that one always feels hungry after a movie? I mean am I the only one? Am I insane??? haha probably, but in all seriousness, short of eating a 3 course meal before a movie, I ALWAYS leave hungry!!! Ahh that sucks... and I refuse to eat theater popcorn or soda cuz that drains another ten bucks after I pay for a 8.50 fuckin movie... call me cheap, I don't care I ain't paying... haha... I mean I would sneak in candy or the occassional beer in my younger days, but now my friends and i are always running late to a movie when the theater is 5 FREAKIN MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD! maybe that is a curse being so close... cuz we sit there and sit there being lazy until it starts w/o any thought of the tasty treats we could endulge in during our cinematic experience. there is relief, however, because thankfully, there is fast food all around here so I won't go dying of hunger. So I saw Secret Window the other day... for 4.75 CHEAP! it was a matinee and let's just say thankfully I didn't pay the regular price cuz yea Johnny Depp is my fav actor, but not even his amazing skills as an actor could save this poorly written and edited movie. Which is exactly what most critics said, but fuck it, I wanted to see it... Ok OK enough about that... I'm sure I have bored u enough by now haha but if i still have your attention, let's continue! So more likely than not I will be going to this Max Creek show by myself on Friday... and I have heard mixed reactions to going to shows by yourself... one of my sort of friends, who quite frankly hasn't been much of a sort of friend lately cuz i fuckin havent heard from him... I dunno... it's all good... we arent THAT good of friends, i only chilled with the kid for a week, but i figured maybe just maybe I'd have a bro to go to shows with... I'm sure he is busy... anyway he says it is just as fun... so maybe i will chance it... it's only 12 bucks so why the hell should i not just go and have a good time... Creek is sick in concert and puts on amazing shows... i just hope my fuckin job doesnt keep me from going. sigh... i hate that shit! i always sacrfice going to shows for that fuckin place... errr it drives me nuts, but i get satisfaction out of a job well done and i refuse to do anything half ass... you know what i need? i need a chick here with me dammit... there i said it. what would really kick ass is a cute chick who likes to go shows as much as I do...  yea and i like a girl who  doesn't bitch at me every chance she gets... (now that isnt a diss against anyone in particular... its just a theme i run across a bit too much) yea yea my friend pete will say well all chicks bitch and moan... well im sure there are some out there who aren't entirely like that... but im not going to get on the girl subject on my first post on this awesome site!  so maybe this is where i should say ok bill time to go to fuckin sleep... honestly im on such a roll i could write for the next couple of hours... but ill save all my ramblings for future posts... save the eyes from monitor strain for anyone who is reading this in the process... ok that is it... shabs is out quicker than GA TECH was against UCONN tonight baby!!!! PEACE

      Ok where to begin??? hmmm where art thou, my brain, tonight? i honestly don't know. i think it ran away or something. prolly when i found out PHISH, my favorite band, is breaking up for good. *sigh* just when i was at a point in my life where i could think about doing show runs like ive heard about from so many ppl. oh well. if they feel its the time, then its the time and i have nothing but love and respect for those guys cuz they are truly amazing musicians. yes, it did seem like they were less into it than back in the day and yes the hiatus was intended to help things out, but i guess it did but didnt... i think it wasn't long enough. but who knows! all i know is that they will be sorely missed. i just never thought it would end or like this. though it does seem fitting that it will end at the summer festival in their home state of VT. but their music is unbelieveable and i will listen to it to the day i die. long live Phish even after they are no longer together playing music as a group!   Ok i will finish this later. the brain is no where to be found. i had alot more to say and talk about... like the Max Creek show i went to last friday at the Living Room in Providence, RI last weekend in general and my upcoming weekend at the Strangecreek festival. anyway im out of here   "waiting for the time when i can finally say that this has all been wonderful and now im on my way... when its time to leave it all behind, i gotta find the way to but theres nothing i can do to make it stop" - phish

      Ok i'm fine, really! that last post... whew i'm a headcase! haha as long as i am willing to admit that now! anyway ive got nothing else to do so i decided to come back with a vengence and try to mix it up a bit like i used to before my series of woe is me related posts! haha im not gonna apologize! i said what i said! deal with it!   soooooo what the hell is going on everyone?   DID YOU KNOW?  IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT IF EVERYONE IN THE UNITED STATES DID NOT PURCHASE A DROP OF GASOLINE FOR ONE DAY AND ALL AT THE SAME TIME, THE OIL COMPANIES WOULD CHOKE ON THEIR STOCKPILES. AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD HIT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WITH A NET LOSS OF OVER 4.6 BILLION DOLLARS WHICH AFFECTS THE BOTTOM LINES OF THE OIL COMPANIES.  THEREFORE MAY 19TH HAS BEEN FORMALLY DECLARED "STICK IT UP THEIR  BEHIND " DAY AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION SHOULD NOT BUY A SINGLE DROP OF GASOLINE THAT DAY.  THE ONLY WAY THIS CAN BE DONE IS IF YOU FORWARD THIS E-MAIL TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN AND AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN TO GET THE WORD OUT. WAITING ON THIS ADMINISTRATION TO STEP IN AND CONTROL THE PRICES IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REDUCTION AND CONTROL IN PRICES THAT THE ARAB NATIONS PROMISED TWO WEEKS AGO?  REMEMBER ONE THING, NOT ONLY IS THE PRICE OF GASOLINE GOING UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME AIRLINES ARE FORCED TO RAISE THEIR PRICES, TRUCKING COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO RAISE THEIR PRICES WHICH EFFECTS PRICES ON EVERYTHING THAT IS SHIPPED. THINGS LIKE FOOD, CLOTHING, BUILDING MATERIALS, MEDICAL SUPPLIES ETC. WHO PAYS IN THE END? WE DO!  WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF THEY DON'T GET THE MESSAGE AFTER ONE DAY, WE WILL DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  SO DO YOUR PART AND SPREAD THE WORD. FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW. MARK YOUR CALENDARS AND MAKE MAY 19TH A DAY THAT THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES SAY "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!!!!!"  wow, what a mind fuck! hmmm don't think i'll be buying gas tomorrow! so as you might be wondering where did i get this from? a friend of mine sent it to me and now im telling all of you. please spread the word!    damn 2.05 a gallon at cumberland farms... it fuckin sucks! i really want to go up to these oil people and yell at them ALRIGHT! thankfully still 4.21 for a pack of cigs! mmm cancer sticks....   would you look at that? its raining outside.... at least it is at night instead of during the day even tho i am stuck inside at work. its great to be able to take a break and it be nice outside. rain can be so fuckin depressing sometimes.... not tonight tho, im feeling much better thank you very much! i was so tired at work today and there was so little to do and i had both rob and greg there and because i was so tired i couldnt come up with a good game plan to get them both decent hours and still keep them busy... ugh sometimes being a manager sucks especially when you are trying to help out your bro and friend and cant because of hours and amount of work constraints. it sucks! its maddening sometimes. thankfully they are understanding because if they werent i would feel bad but it would also make it harder on me. thats why, greg, when u bitch about not getting more hrs to me, it really makes my life incredibly more stressful. there is nothing i can do and so you bitching to me about it, isnt going to make things better.    Quote of the day!

      Ok, finally i have returned. i apologize... it has been exactly 2 weeks since I have posted and well i have no real excuse. not that i need one.. these are my posts!!! haha. in all seriousness, i have not been in the mood to write in so long. why do i suddenly feel like i should post? i don't really know... probably the fact i should comment on recent happenings before i forget them due to the fact i like the cheeba and my memory isn't what it used to be. the days seem to blend into weeks and the weeks blend into months to the point i can't remember stuff that just happened a week ago. sigh, i really need out of this place for a bit. i don't have a clue what the fuck i'm doing anymore.  The time now is 11:31 in the PM.   Ok, back in time we go before I discuss my inner thoughts on what the hell the title of this post means.  Friday May 7th  The usual suspects: Amit, Greg, Rob, Sebby, Fred, and myself.  What went down: what a day... so much scrambling around but in the end it was such a perfect night for getting completely annhiliated! i swear for whatever reason that has been one of the best drinking nights in awhile... even tho that sounds really dumb... apparently, ive been reduced to rating our drinking nights... of which there are many! but in all seriousness, everything was on that night and all of us got hammered. legendary games of flip cup were forever immortalized that night... lol... rob was the first to suffer the ill effects of heavy drinking and was the first casuality of the night as he passed out early... no worries, bro, it happens to us all at some point! it really sucked however, because we didnt end up getting much sleep before our jaunt into new york city the next day.....  Saturday May 8th  cast and crew: amit, rob, myself... met up in nyc with rob's gf julianna and two of her friends...   NYC... now that was a good f'in time! i really wish i had gotten more sleep tho... i also wish i had taken a piss right before the show cuz i had to drain the lizard so bad it hurt. damn that sucked! but it was well worth it. dane cook was so fuckin funny im suprised i didnt piss myself. shoes??? fuck shoes! im going shoeless! hahaha... he didnt do that skit at the show, but i put up that exact away message that night on AIM before we hit the road. but all in all it was a great night, the ride down was pretty fast and we kept the tunes cranked... show, unreal to say the least and i havent laughed that much in a long time... good shit! afterwards, and the longest piss ever.... we headed out of carolines and it was damn cold outside, so we ducked into a pizza place and grabbed some pizza before hittin the road once again to head home... with a quick stop to drop off julianna in between. her friends left right after the show to take the train home to go to some bar... yea im sure all of you can see what is wrong with that picture... you are in nyc and you want to leave to go to a bar in milford? hmmmmmmmmm very dumb indeed. once we arrived safely back at the pad, we attempted to play some halo... not good at 2 am after getting wasted the night before and nothing close to what any rational person would consider sleep. so one by one we all crashed out. you would think i would get some quality sleep that night? hell no... but thats beside the point. moving on once again.  The time is now 12:10 in the AM...  this weekend was pretty interesting if not weird and i cant feel like somehow the events have changed how i feel about stuff. i dont really know how to explain that, but it was a weekend unlike most ive had. friday night, pretty much hung low and got f'ed up in the usual manners. saturday it was so nice outside and my roomate wanted to go for a car ride and we ended up driving to vermont and then because we were so close to new hampshire, we somehow ended up going into NH and then driving southeast into the most rural parts of massachusetts and then eventually to umass to get rob and then back down to west hartford. crazy shit i kid you not. once back here we grilled up some steaks and started drinking. i already had plans for that night, so rob, tim and amit hung out here while i went with dave and his bud jake to the brickyard to meet up with ppl from work for my friend jess' birthdays. well we all got pretty trashed and had a real good time. thanks guys for a really fun night! basically not a whole lot of sleep but other than that a good weekend... even sunday despite the torture of having to see my stepgrandmother who i dont even call grandmother and who doesnt even want to be called grandma. whatever, thankfully it is over with, which is a terrible thing to say about seeing ones grandfather (who we are supposed to see but claire - the so called step grandmother is always in tow) but thats the way shit is in our family... good f'in times let me just tell you.   but thats about it for the recap. for whatever reason i was so motivated to write tonight but as this progresses it seems to get more difficult to put shit down. i feel like a different person writing right now... im sure if u know my style of posting u might have thought that by now. but i will walk away from this for a second and come back hopefully fresh and ready to keep this shit moving.   *REAL TIME UPDATE* shit, this girl who i used to talk to online like 4 years ago... well recently i saw her online and i really thought she had dropped off the face of the earth, but i guess not. so i sent out an IM to her with no response. well just now my friend peter sent her an IM and she asked how he knows her screen name and like a dumbass he says bill and well she basically said ok time to ignore you... fuckin bitch. its such bullshit because its been so long and i was trying to be nice by saying hi. damn that pisses me off. really im only mad because i gave a fuck about this girl in the first place. my bad. sorry to be there for you when u needed me. sorry to get a bit too attached to you back in the day like 4 fuckin years ago i dont want you now bitch. sorry for ever fuckin caring. sorry for whatever shit i did that made u never want to speak to me again even if it wasnt me and only you. why do i say sorry? cuz i really shouldnt. its her loss she doesnt want to say hi back. see why i am comfortable in not doing anything? because of shit like this and girls like this... with their petty bullshit. why the fuck did i waste a good IM on her? ive never said this about anyone, but i wish i had never met her... all the fuckin time i wasted at roger williams talking to her... fuck!   ok im stressed... i need a quick cig break! The time is 12:32 in the AM  the time is now 1:08 am (tuesday morning)  ok im finally back with a clear mind, a bit of energy left and shit to talk about! i couldnt finish the post last night so i left it to the next night (monday night) but now it is already into tuesday... so yea if you want to be technical about it, this post will be posted two weeks and two days after my last one. so sue me! haha ok ok lets get right to it!  basically, ive reached a crossroads in my life... shit is good and always is and im having a blast. work is getting a lot better and i have to do far less and it is more enjoyable knowing all i really have to do is manage and put in some hard work organizing from time to time but i no longer get stressed out about it. it really isnt worth it. i dont try to do too much when i dont have the time or the energy... if i cant accomplish it all in one day i dont get upset or angry that i couldnt get it all done at once but find pride in what i did accomplish which is usually damn more than anyone else can do. i am also able to actually chill with other people from work while at work instead of constantly being occupied with shit so i miss out on getting to know them. so really nothing is going wrong in my life yet i feel like im stuck and not getting any better. believe me i make daily improvements and learn from my mistakes, but my life seems it is only routine and not spontaneous enough and when i am spontaneous like on sat when amit and i just took off and drove wherever, im still left feeling like i wasted some of my free time and didnt utilize it to its fullest extent. i know that sounds petty, but im so anal about everything in my life, including free time. free time being so precious i want to jam pack it with shit i dont get to do during the week. so i guess i was feeling a bit bummed b/c it was so nice outside and yea we were out and about, i think the ride was a bit too long for my taste.  that isnt what is really bothing me however. im sure u know what it is about... its the same old stupid bullshit ive posted about before. the female population of course.... yea i know im sure u are sick of hearing me bitch and moan about that shit, but frankly, i need to do something or i am going to get seriously depressed here. yea i know what u are thinking or u think you know about me... that i let if im getting with the ladies or not affect my happiness, mood, and state of mind. fuck that! i used to but havent in a long ass time! only on days when im miserable does that happen, but they are so rare that i just brush it aside... but u can only do that so many times before shit starts to affect you... im in a funk but as i said before shit is good right now... i wish i had more money... but im comfortable and i enjoy life. very much so. im just sick and tired of going so long without a female. i know its my own damn fault because i am so damn picky and i have this fucked up complex about how i gotta know for sure if the chick is interested in me before asking her out... which for all of you out there in BLOGLAND should know... ive never asked a girl out in my life and have it go well, unless you consider the proms in high school. tho there were a few times i actually did ask a couple of girls out in the most fucked up and awkwardly ways due to some clever schemes offered up by close friends that these chicks missed completely and probably thought i was some kind of wacko.   for example (yes this is embarrassing but i dont give a shit anymore and so i will share so ya'll get a good laugh)... back in high school my buddy zim said dude ask out this girl u like (i wont mention her name) by sending a note and a box of dates (which is dried fruit or something like that by the way for those of you who dont know). i can't remember what he told me to write in the note but im sure u can surmise a bit... oh here are some dates, can i have one? something corny like that. needless to say it didnt work and one day i rode down her street to the freakin park and she saw me and thought i was stalking her. my luck with girls is so crappy i cant even begin to tell you. like that bitch i mentioned before? i talked to her for so long and ignored girls who were actually around me and i found out later that i could have gotten with because i was holding out that we would be together at some point in the future. i was really shy back then and it was easier talking to someone who i had met once who lived far away on the phone then girls in person. i dont have that problem anymore and havent for so long now, i just have problem reading females and asking out the ones that im really interested in because of my fucked up paranoid mind and that same old bullshit... being scared of rejection. which btw, is crap because im confident, i just dont like getting my mind played with, so i miss out on opportunity after opportunity. the only ones i dont miss out on are if they come to me. and none have really come to me in so very long and that is why i am in my current state. yes so i know what you are all saying. the simple answer is to just do it. well that would be nice if i could. i cant begin to tell you all the opporunities ive missed out on... all the women who have passed me by... all the stupid what if i had done this or what if i had done that. i will say this... thankfully im not one of those ppl that has to constantly have someone or i'd be up shits creek right now in pure agony. i do have some self control and patience... and believe me im really fuckin patient.   if you were me... would you be able to put up with yourself?   its pretty fuckin difficult let me tell you. i think im my own worst enemy. great f'in song there Lit... couldnt have written it better if i tried...   so anyone have any fuckin advice? how do you read women? i dont know how other guys do it. its like fuckin impossible. im constantly battling my mind over whether they are just being friendly or more than that and playing hard to get but still flirting innocently. im fuckin baffled. you know how i usually know when a girl is interested in me? when she tells me she wants to get it on with me. thats when i know. haha but how often does that happen to a regular dude like me? not fuckin often let me tell you. i usually spend inordinate amounts of time talking with them before even hanging out together and then they go on the attack cuz once again i move like im fuckin 80 yrs old instead of 26.. when it comes to making moves on girls, im like a snail. snails are cool... but slower than time. they chill in pretty much one spot all day long and then wait for the tide to come in or for a seagull to snatch them up. so thus my dilemma. either i stew like always and do nothing and wait around for the next one to give me a shot or i take the proactive approach. i hear u screaming choice #2 but im so hesitant because im not really into dating. i like finding a girl who i vibe with really well and then just getting together and seeing where it goes from there. im not into the whole date this person, than this person and so on and so forth... never have, dont think i ever will. but i know one thing is for sure... either ill find someone or be alone. being alone is def not something i want to see happen... but if it does then ill actually have a leg to stand on and be able to whine this much and get away with it. lol...    so anyway as i said before i dont really know what im doing anymore. am i coming or going? i can barely decide... its like  im heading down a straight road and not taking any of the side streets because they are all dark and im either too lazy or too content to wander down and explore. im too complacent in not doing anything. ive had it too easy even if ive gone long stretchs without a significant other. so now im at a standstill. its late and ive wasted more time bitching about the same old shit. i could even go into specifics... about specific people, but really thats probably pretty pointless considering i probably wont do anything anyway. i talk the talk, but i cant walk the walk. its sad but true. but im comfortable with that... in the grand scheme of things i go about my day and i hardly think about it. yet when i see a girl i like i cant stop thinking about it. when i see girls in general i cant stop thinking about it and its been driving me crazy for so long. rambling on like this helps tho. so thanks for listening and bearing with me. i really am a chill person so its suprising to me that i can get so worked up over females and their effect on me. im just a sucker i guess... but aren't we all? haha   IM OUT  PEACE  The time is now 2:19 in the AM (time for bed you wussy dumbass!)  SHUT UP CLOCK!

      Drum roll please??? Sigh... once again it is Sunday night. Ugh, back to work tomorrow. As I am sure you can tell, I am ever so fuckin thrilled about that. Not to mention it is supposed to rain all freakin day! Oh what a way to start off the work week, ya know? Haha... anyhow... I'm sure all will be well... I, like most ppl, just dread Mondays. Anyway.. dammit I can't think... someone punch me in the faace! That might get the few brain cells I have left running about. I do have shit on my mind and I am just really unsure of how to deal with it or even talk about it. It's really a general complaint and frustration that I think everyone experiences at some point, but for me, sometimes it really bogs me down.   *sigh*  Alright, I will spill the beans. What is bothering me, is how easily it is to lose touch with someone or a few friends, or even a bunch of friends. I have met and gotten to know so many people who I am no longer in contact with and yes it makes it easier having less people to stay in touch with, but alot of those people I would def like to hear from... I suppose it really comes down to the simple question of, how good of friends are they in the first place. Also, people move on and have their own lives to live and friends get lost in the shuffle. I just wish some of these people would make more of an effort. It certainly would make me feel better... but it's really unfortunate and for me... it never gets any easier. Losing touch with friends hits me hard always, but even more so when they are special to me or were at some point and for whatever reason life seems to remind you of them at the weirdest possible moment and blam! you have a chance to talk to them again and see how they are... even after so many years of not knowing whatever happened to them. But for whatever reason, they don't respond to your IM... which could mean several things. A) they simply dont want to talk.. (why they wouldn't I dont know) B) never got the IM in the first place for some reason, maybe b/c someone else was using their screen name to get online (it used to happen quite a bit before so that is why I can't entirely dismiss that as a possibility) or C) they dont remember you (unlikely in this particular case that is bothering me, but understandable). Being the paranoid freak that I am, I always lean toward B... sometimes A, but my brain can't figure out why they wouldn't want to talk to me again after so much time. Maybe that is the reason... Time. The time we talked and were there for each other in the past, I guess will stay in the past and maybe there is no reason to talk again. Who f'in knows. I was certainly a lot different back in those days than I am now and maybe it is for the better we lost touch... I don't even know where this person is at in their life... Well I made the effort. And if my paranoid brain doesn't keep bugging me about possibility B, then I probably will just let it go as if I never saw this particular person come online. However, I can be such a stubborn ass sometimes, so I doubt my brain will be able to let me do just that. And the problem lies in the fact for whatever reason I would like to see how this person is doing really badly, but I don't want to become annoying... Oh what to do???   Lets break this down shall we? I know you probably dont want to hear it... but I have no one to talk to about this so I am going to try and work it out via this post. I have already made the initial offering of an IM. Whether this IM was received and read by the party it was intended to, remains a mystery. I could add this person to yahoo messenger and then IM them once again that way, but in order to add them to messenger, that person has to then accept you as their buddy or contact. So I am definately iffy on that. Very iffy. Second, I could send an email... but I just don't know. I mean what harm could it do to be persistent? I just get very nervous. I was shaking when I actually scrolled down my long ass buddy list and saw this person online in my newest folder... entitled: ppl who have dropped off the face of the earth... which is the weirdest thing b/c I just made this folder and I re-added this person today for reasons still unknown to me... it's so freaky. Dammit... I just dont know what to do. I'm at a loss...  of all the close friends I have lost touch with... this person and only this person will I go this nuts about b/c this person and I went through alot of stuff back in the day together even though we werent in the same place. I worry about this person and have never forgotten about them. Obviously, I have lived my life and gone long periods of time w/o ever having them pop into my mind, but seeing them come online did something to me. I really thought I would never see them or talk to them again...   So I have been online all day since I woke up. An hour before I went to my parents for a cookout and to celebrate my brother Tim's birthday, I saw this person online when I came back from watching tv and doing chores. I was so shocked that this person was online literally a couple of hours after something compelled me to re-add them to my buddy list, that I had to take a shower (which I needed to do anyway) before I could send out that IM. I was so nervous that I didn't look at the IM box for a good couple of minutes... and when I didn't get a response, I closed the box... said it fuckin figures and left to go to my parents. In the entire time since I got back (around 6:30)... it is 12:30 now... so 6 hrs... I have seen this person come and go half a dozen times from being online. Don't get me wrong, I haven't sat here glued to my computer waiting to see if they would IM me. I have been so busy this evening, that in order to keep my sanity, I have stopped what I was doing every so often to check my away message for new IMs... and well nothing of course. So what does this all mean? Who the f' knows?!? Probably nothing whatsoever!!!! My mind is now saying that I need to just relax and if its meant to be I will talk to this person, if not, then sadly no. So I think I will take my minds advice and let it go for now.    "I don't know if you can hear me I'm feelin down and can't think clearly And even though it's complicated We got time to start again I don't know if you can hear me  Somethings I'd change but it's too late I'd take the past and make it straight And even though it's complicated  We got time to start again I don't know if you can hear me  Even though it's complicated  We got time to start again I don't know if you can hear me  I'm sorry for the things I said But some thoughts just won't leave my head And even though it's complicated  We got time to start again I don't know if you can hear me  Even though it's complicated  We got time to start again I don't know if you can hear me  Even though it's complicated  We got time to start again I don't know if you can hear me"  "Start Again" by Adam Duritz

      I wasn't going to post but I had a few to drink tonight and I am a bit buzzed so why the fuck not? I had to say a few words before bed so I can rest easier.   First off... the fuckin Red Sox. They really make it tough to be a fan. Considering I have been one practically my entire life, from the moment I was old enough to say "Red Sox," to the day I die, that is saying alot. Honestly... tonight's game was one of the worst ways to lose other than last year in game 7 of the ALCS in extra innings on a fuckin Aaron Boone home run. Wakefield was on fire tonight... gave up no runs on 3 hits through the 7th inning, but as soon as they took him out, everything went to shit. Errors led to ridiculous runs after we left the bases loaded the previous top of the inning. We lost 4-2 after we had the lead 2-0 for practically the entire game. Poor Wake... the guy has been struggling and finally comes out in top form against the Yanks, throws a gem only to get a no-decision and the team ends up losing in the end. I just don't fucking understand it. It happens time and time again. What the fuck?????!???? There seems to be no fucking justice for this team or its fans. Two games in row now we have given it up to the Yankees through fucking countless errors and leaving guys stranded on base. This is not Red Sox baseball... it looks like a bunch of little leaguers playing out there and its downright fuckin depressing. Shit I was in such a good mood too... and what makes it worse is I usually don't let baseball or sports in general get to me these days... I haven't in a long time. When we lost to the Yankees in the ALCS last year in the usual heartbreaking fashion... even then I was like "fuckin figures." There is no justice whatsoever for Red Sox nation. Every fuckin team, esp NY, seems to rise to the occasion against us, even if they stink worse than my nuts after a basketball session at Whiting Lane. Sigh... so thats my baseball rant. I apologize, but I needed to go off for a bit.   Shit affects people in different ways... and this vast disappointment hit me particularly hard tonight... yea in a sense cuz I had a few too many brews tonight, but also made me think about other shit that isnt going right... which is 100% my fault of course cuz I am a lazy bastard and I don't do shit to help myself out in that area whatsoever. Once again! I am fuckin lonely as hell. I am happy as hell too, but also lonely... and I just don't dwell on it or let it show to my friends... a) because there is no point b) it will ruin any chance of enjoying my life c) if i dont do shit to help the situation out then there is no reason to get upset about it............ but! and this is a big but! I am still miserable when it comes to the fact I have no significant other in my life. Yes I can say there may be a possible situation out there that could lead to something happening, but I don't fucking know, because it is out of my hands and frankly I am sick of not having any control over shit... but that is the way it goes. I just go on each day and hope that maybe someday something may happen for me... or just accept the fact I will be alone for the rest of my life... which is a damn possible scenario considering how much I am set in my ways. Call me pessimistic, I just don't see anything positive right now in that area of my life. There always seems to be something in the way. So I guess I don't try hard enough or put enough time into trying to figure shit out... but I figure whats the use? My luck sucks much more than the Red Sox do right now. Every fuckin time a chick tells me she likes me, which isnt often, there always seems to be some fuckin catch or some bullshit making shit more complicated than it needs to be and in the past I jumped right in with reckless abandon and usually got hurt or dissed in the end, but now I just dont care. I am lonely, but I am not going to put any kind of effort unless I am sure something will come of it... cuz what the fucks the point of trying if there isnt something at the end of the tunnel? I know that is a fucked up way to look at shit, but if you all only knew where I have been, then you would understand.   Anyway, thats my rant for the evening. It's 11:30 pm and I need to get to bed. I promised myself I would get to bed a bit earlier tonight so I could catch up on some much needed rest and not be a zombie in the morning since I am working 8am-whatever shifts this week. That's it from me. I promise my next post will be from me in a better mood.

      Last night I went to a party with my roomate Amit and my brother Rob. It seemed to be cool at first, but got lame real quick when everyone started to leave in droves from a period between 11:30 and 12:30. I guess that is what happens when practically everyone (mostly people from Amit's office) at the party was either my and Amit's age or older. Sad so sad... but anyway, on the ride back from the party, Amit, went off on some drunken tangent about how none of us can truly be happy without having a significant other. Where that came from is anyone's guess, and in this instance it was proven that alcohol in certain amounts can affect one's rational thought. Hence my blog title. The funny thing is that even though I came up with plenty of reasons against his claim, he still insisted that I was not truly happy because I don't have a girlfriend and that I needed one in order to be happy. Which is understandable considering the amount of bitching I have done over this past year to him and my friends in support of his theory and in posts on numerous occassions. If you didn't know me in person and were basing what you knew of me from those posts, then you might come to the same conclusion. However! I can tell you first and foremost that this is indeed not the case... well I won't say entirely, but for the most part. I am indeed happy with things in my life right now. I do wish I had someone or at least some kind of situation that would result in me having some kind of encounter with someone from the female population. Would it make me happier? Most definitely! But I do not need a chick to be happy and I've been living it up the best I can with the means I have at my disposal without being involved with anyone. And a long fucking time it has been. But I make the most of it and keep going with it and I am sure sometime something will happen for me. Until then I keep living the same day in and day out and don't let the fact I am alone bog me down.   It almost did tonight b/c I talked with one of my exgfs on the phone for about half an hour and we caught up on things going on in each of our lives. After I got off the phone, I had this weird sad feeling in my gut. My stupid brain started thinking about her and the good times we shared and how I miss her... not in the sense of us being together, but b/c we are good friends and don't hang out all that much. Also, in a general sense it made me feel how much I miss having someone special in my life. It got me thinking about all the great things about having a girlfriend and having that someone to hold and fall asleep next to. I do admit I sleep much better when I have my own space in bed, but it really is great falling asleep next to someone. So I guess it inspired me to write a bit about it, because I hadn't felt like that in awhile. I have just been going about my business, working, paying bills, eating, getting wasted with the guys, going to shows, and enjoying life and I haven't worried about how I was doing mentally in that respect in so long... it just hit me weird and I had a weird emotional response to it. I really don't know what it means... but I am quite sure that it is only because I am lonely and as happy as I am doing my own thing, having someone would only add to my happiness...   So yeah it has been exactly a year since Amit and I moved in this place... How crazy is that??? A year? It is unfathomable considering all the great times we have had and it really feels like it is just the beginning. The time has gone by so quickly it went by barely noticed. I remember moving in and all that hassle. The night we had a party for the first time and ended up going to the beach the next day at like 8 in the morning. All the other great parties we had going through the fall into the crazy cold winter which seems like a distance memory these days since it is has been so freakin nice out! I could go on and on, but I need to get to bed real soon so maybe I will rehash another day. Believe it or not, it has also been about the same amount of time since I last had a girlfriend... the irony! I've had my own fuckin place to bring girls back and it hasnt happened! oh well... aint the end of the world! so yup it was def a nostalgic feeling night to say the least. But all in all, it ended another good weekend. This is getting to be a damn good trend if I might say so! A week ago this past Friday had a great time at the Max Creek show in Providence... yes I know in my last blog I said I would probably comment on it and yes it has taken me 10 days to finally write again, but I am a lazy too busy having fun unfortunately to post bastard! Haha anyway, Rob went and we had a fuckin blast. He also as he put it "gained a new appreciation for jam music," which is fuckin awesome because he got into it on his own without me pushing it on him. He decided he wanted to go and then he kept his mind open and just went with it. Rock on dude! Thanks again for making the trip out there with me. That ride back was insane to say the least. See why I hate driving in the rain? I don't think I have ever driven through rain that has come down as hard as it did that night. Fuckin' crazy shit... but that cig after we hit Willimantic was damn good. Man, I was wired from just trying to stay on the road... so it helped me wind down a bit...   Friday (two days ago) we had another cool session out on the balcony with the usual rowdy drunken antics... no need to go into detail b/c I am sure it will be revealed in part somehow someday in some sort of medium... lol last night I already talked about and today Rob and I spent most of the afternoon "sweatin' out the toxins" (as Greg likes to describe playing sports or working out)... playing some baseball on a field at a local school which thankfully usually never has too many people around so we can chill and not have people around to get beaned in the head by fly balls... tho there were some kids running around who did make nice targets... lol so all in all it has been fun, but now it is back to work. Which sucks because I have to work 8-5 shifts all week after having spent the last 2 and a half yrs working mostly 11-8 shifts... ugh that is why I need to get to sleep seeing how it is 12:15 am and I am still writing on here... damn long as blog entries... I have so much to say and so little time and of course I wait until now to write... good fuckin timing I have, don't you think? Anyway I gotta get outta here so I will try to post again soon... yes I always say that but it is always wishful thinking on my part! PEACE

      Yes, it is true. So true... but sometimes bad news is worse when you hear it and then build it up in your mind. Hmmm with that kind of opening I must have some juicy story to tell... alas, tis not be the case. But I wanted to write and its been so freakin long... so I had to start off somewhere! Hopefully it will get better further down. Anyhow, so shit at work is good one moment and seems like so bad the next. Had a great week down working in the kids store at good o'l Westfarms last week organizing the shelves for them with one of my workers who the rest of my stock guys have dubbed "The Iceman" b/c however daunting a task or however bad of a disorganized mess the shelves are, he goes about getting shit together with that look of pure determination. Its intense. So we got major shit accomplished... with the rest of my stock team taking care of things upstairs I really didnt mind spending so much time down there b/c the kids store is my escape from the insanity of the adult store. I'm friends with all the managers and its good to have people around to talk to when down in the trenches. Not that I don't have that in the adult store, but it is alot more relaxed down there. In fact even if the other two managers weren't working there, hanging out with Tracey makes up for it. She's really fuckin cool, a good friend who is closer to my age then most of the management in both stores and truly down-to-earth which you don't find much at A & F.   Anyway on to the bad news... well just as we got the kids store to the way I wanted it, word reached me that we had to move some stuff around... which is fine, but it threw a monkeywrench into the plan to keep things the way I had organized them on the racks. I like keeping the same things together and not separating them... but some stuff has to be more accessable to get out on the floor. So I lashed out on poor Greg who came downstairs to bring something back and to tell me what he overheard... well I really dont need to apologize, he knew I would be mad, but told me anyway. It's like he needs attention anyway he can get it, which he tries to get by telling me important stuff that he really shouldn't be hearing about before me considering I'm the fuckin manager... its none of his business... and then he went and told Patrik the store manager I was mad... again... Greg and his need for attention... which is why he goes on and on about his gf... thankfully I haven't had to hear about in awhile. I usually get the watered down version from Rob when I am in a better mood to hear it. Greg likes to pick his spots and they are always the wrong spots. It just got to the point a couple weeks back where I wanted to yell at him in Dane Cook voice  ALRIIIIIIGHT!   But that is besides the point... the point is, having started it upstairs, it really isnt that bad. It really was the thought of what it entailed that made me initially throw up the red flag... but I'm all good now and much happier b/c of it. I was in a sour mood for a bit yesterday and this morning and nearly took a few ppls heads off b/c I was mad and frustrated at the whole thing. But I'm done with that... I'm trying, really I am. I used to get so stressed at my job that it drove me crazy. For a long time I have been working on limiting my stress and getting upset at stupid things I shouldnt be getting upset about. Every so often, such as in this instance, I lapse and go back to my old ways. At least I caught it before it got out of hand and I ended up apologizing to the ppl I had bitched and complained to about the project. So as I said its all good now! I'm def trying to just trying to be more positive these days and as long as I avoid depressing subjects and as much stress as I can possibly avoid, I know I will be alot better off.   Ok so where is this blog heading? Hmmm... straight down the sidewalk and into the gutter! Haha... Let's see... what to report on. There is quite a bit due to my laziness and lack of posts. I am sure you are all quite upset at my somewhat pathetic output of shit to read while you are waiting for something a thousand times more interesting to do... Ok so as some of you know my brother Rob's now ex-gf broke up with him a short time ago. I wasn't sure if this was something I should talk about, but I just wanted to touch on it briefly as I had some insight that maybe he hasnt heard from me already. I really wanted to comment on it at the time, but things are at the point where its prob ok to say whatever. It was rough for Rob considering the amount of time he invested in the relationship. It is a shame it really didnt get started. They didn't even have a chance to let anything progress at all. Not that my brother didnt give it an effort, his ex didnt seem to or even seem like she wanted to. She really is a nice girl, but confusing at best. She proglonged telling him how she felt that it made it more agonizing than if she had just let him know (yup cheesy reference to my title). If she reads this all I have to say to her is that I wish things had turned out differently. I'm sure you have to work out alot of things in your own life so if you didnt feel that it was the right thing then you had to do the tough thing and break it off. Its never easy and sometimes its better for things like this to happen earlier than later. So take care and if you need to talk feel free to IM me. As for my bro... I am glad to see all is good again with him and when he says get busy living or get busy dying, i say you're goddamned right... haha good times ahead, rob... good fuckin times! so dont worry things have a funny way of working out in time and it will be something new and unexpected...  and as always anytime u need to talk dont fuckin hesitate to get in touch with me or just stop by the pad...   Part of the bring Rob out to get him fuckin trashed campaign of last week was the Brickyards block party... i think the first or second one of the summer so far... they usually have 3 or 4 a summer and you know what? it was the same as always... tons of fucked up ppl who paid 10 bucks cover and then 4 bucks for a measly 12 oz cup of Coors Light. ohhh what a night middle june baaaaaaaack in 04... (cheesy and rather bad i might add rip-off of that song... whats the name of it again?) Anyway, mission not accomplished as none of us got trashed at all. I blame the the lack of any motivation to drink on the combination of a really bad D'Angelo's steak and cheese sub I had an hr or so earlier with the chuggage of not one, but two Sam Adams Summer Ales in the span of a few minutes. Ugh it was a bit much for the stomach that had barely anything in it all day. Second, we really didnt have much time to pregame since it was already around 10 when we left to go. It was good we got there when we did so we had a chance to scope out the scene before the masses decended on the street like ants over a piece of fallen food. Third, those beer prices were a tad ridiculous... its amazing ppl have that much money to drop so easily on that shit. I'm like fuckin a... i could get a 12 pack of Coors Light for the price i paid for 2 beers... ya ya ya... its the price you pay so u can go out and have a good time... which I think we all did, but it sucks it has to cost so damn much! Tho it was pretty interesting... I ran into the most random people I know... saw this girl I took to my senior prom who I hadnt seen in like 5 yrs it seems and I got up to give her a hug and she seemd like she didnt know what to do... I was just trying to be polite... after all, she came over to say hi to me. As usual saw an exgf out and about... with some dude in tow. haha and I didnt even give a shit... Rob and Greg are both proof... they were like dude, go talk to her... I'm like if she wants to talk to me, fine, but I'm not going to even waste my time going over to talk to her. She didnt want to be friends or stay in touch after we broke up, thats her problem, certainly not mine! It just sucks having to see them!!!! Esp with other people and I'm all by myself!!! Ugh, for once I'd like to be like ha! look who I'm with, take that! All to see the look on their face... thats it... that priceless look on an ex's face when they see you with someone 10 times hotter. Its magical. Ok I'm psycho... I just spent about 12 lines of this blog talking about some stupid ex I dont give a shit about. Please why didnt someone slap me? Lastly, Darik and the Funbags played as always... they are good but they need to cover some new songs... seen em so many fuckin times... ok boys time for something different, ok? gettin a wee bit tired of the same quick montage of like 20 songs with 15 sec snippets of each... haha its all good tho, they are def the party band of CT. One can't go anywhere to get drunk and not end up seeing them playing somwhere. It was def a fun night... and it was a good thing that I didn't make any drunken beer goggle induced mistakes...    Dammmmmmmit.......... its LATE! crap I was doing so well getting to bed early this week and now it is nearly 2 am! Second night in a row I have been up this late, but the last couple of days its been to bed early to catch up on sleep. So I guess I am going to peace it for now... in all honesty I could prob keep writing and writing... if not for the fact my eyes are closing slowly and half my brain wants to shut down and the other half wants to keep rambling on. But when it comes to sleep... the part of the brain that advocates for sacking out ALWAYS wins... so I am peacin' it! Later... hopefully I'll have a good story to post after I hit up the Max Creek show at the Living Room in Providence this Friday! Can't wait... Creek shows are so much fun... they are such a great band... Ok NOW I am out for good!

      I am lazy. I admit it. I have been wanting to post for a while now, but each time I go to write, I think of another excuse... mainly it is because I am too damn tired to or too damn high to even concentrate. Whatever the case may be, it is the sole reason why it has been a bit since my last post. But excuses aside even though right now I am really tired, though not high, I am going to give this a shot and possibly get some good shit down on here. Life has been busy lately and so it would probably be in my best interest to get some stuff out of my head on onto this here medium so you all can see what stirs in my brain. However, I don't even know where to begin b/c there is alot to discuss!  Ok. Brain needs to start functioning... NOW  The summer has now officially begun as of this past weekend. I started the festival season off right by hitting up the Strangecreek Campout in Greenfield, MA. A few of you have already heard me talk about my weekend, but I am going to go into it a bit for those of you who haven't! I had been looking forward to it for so long and shit at work almost ruined it, but I have a good group of guys working for me over there and they were able to keep things together during my absense and kick some serious shipment ass on Sunday. I felt bad for having a good time when they were slaving away, but I have certainly made up for it these past 3 days. Anyway, thanks guys for all your help! It makes leaving so much easier when you know that you can go and not have to worry about shit being accomplished. Anyway, on to Strangecreek! First off, what an amazing weekend overall. Everything seemed to click all at once and not only was the music so f'in good, but the weather was so nice that it was almost perfect... it just made being there so much more enjoyable and I was able to relax so much... which I really hadn't done in so long. I would have liked to stay through Sunday night, but it didnt matter b/c I already had a great time. I can't begin to explain it b/c its just a feeling I have about the weekend... but as I said everything must have been in alignment, bc I had a kickass time one of the best I'd have to say. Even despite the fact I didn't have too many ppl to hang out with, I was able to enjoy alone time and just sit there and take in everything. Tho the whole time I did wish I had someone to really chill with instead of just being there with someone else who didnt really talk much, just kinda chilled and watched the show. But oh well, no worries, I had fun regardless. Always do. The festival was very small... the organizers were only selling 1500 tickets, so there werent too many people around, so it wasn't difficult to get to anything or see any band you wanted to... up close even if you got to the main stage late for a bands set. Everything was in short walking distance... from the parking lot which was right there and the woods where everyone camped was 2 min from the parking lot and stage area... basically it was such a great setup and so convienent that it made getting around so easy. I really glad I went. As for the music, I won't really go into it b/c I saw so many awesome bands I've seen before (Max Creek, Strangefolk, rane, The Breakfast, Raisinhill, etc) and it would take forever to talk about them all. I am especially psyched that I got to see bands I had never seen before but only heard of (mainly Uncle Billy's Smokehouse, Jiggle the Handle, Fungus Amungus, Reverend Tor Band etc).... and it was quite a treat b/c they all had sick sets and everyone seemed to be covering the Dead that weekend so that made it even better! It really sucked coming home b/c I didnt want to and then I had to work the next day so I did have that letdown feeling. It sucked b/c I went from such a high to such a low so quickly without any time to let the experience of the weekend settle in. But I was fine in no time and back into the swing of things. So now as I sit here... I can't wait for the next show and later on this summer the next festival.. which if I go to one at the end of June isnt that far away.   In the meantime, I plan on heading to Providence again in a couple of weeks to see Max Creek once again at the Living Room. If they play a show half as good as the last Living Room show it will still be an amazing time. Yea I never commented on that, but let's just say I had so much fun... some fun that was unexpected (a select few of u know what im talking about) and some fun that always comes with going to see Creek. All in all, I was out of commission the day after that show! Which sucked, but at the same time I didn't help matters by not just crashing out when I got home after sleeping on the couch at my friends place. Instead of going right back to bed after the hour drive home, I waited up to get Phish tix at 10 am. Not only did I get the two tickets I first found upon the inital search, but 2 tickets in another section when I thought erronously that the first transaction didn't go through! I discovered this as such when I checked my email the other day and I had received two confirmation e-mails from Ticketbastard that said my tickets had been printed. I'm like WTF!?!?!? so I then went to my credit card website and logged in and sure enough... two identical charges to Ticketbastard for Phish tickets... so I then said to myself dammit my credit card is high enough... this sucks! and what the hell am I going to do with all these tickets???? well I havent decided yet what I am going to do, but I'll probably sell the second pair of tickets on ebay or something like that and make some money. Sound good? I thought so too.  Anywaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Im f'in tired! I really wanted to ramble some more about useless nonsense or random shit but its 1:05 am and I really really really should get some shut eye. It's been a long work week so far. So f'in busy! Tomorrow is going to be busy as well and so is Friday. It sucks b/c I'd love to go see this band moe. at the Fleet Center in Boston on Fri, but I have no one to go with and it being 2 plus hrs away I'd have to leave work early... well I don't see that happening... so I will prolly just grit it out and then head over to the Arch Street Tavern and see rane play. I've seen them a few times and yea never seen moe. which is crazy b/c they are up there on my list of fav bands... but it will cost me far less to drive 5 min to Hartford... 5 buck cover to see rane as opposed to spending 30$ for a ticket to moe. and of course some $ for gas and parking. Either way I will have a good time b/c rane is also one of my favorite bands... and I'll never get sick of seeing those guys play. But other than that... really no other plans this weekend. Someone come visit me dammit! Haha... well I really got to be going. it is now 1:12 am and the longer I linger the less sleep I will get. So take it easy and I'll be back soon!

      Damn it's late and I really should be asleep because I have to work once again at 8 am. I've been pulling crazy 12 plus hour shifts the last couple of weeks... including that 24 hour shift&nbsp;the week before last and a 16 hour shift yesterday. Good fuckin times, right? Haha... I'm at 52 hours for the week after 4 days... so yes I've been real fuckin busy! But it has been worth it because I had last Friday off after working 50 hours in 4 days (weird trend I am developing would you say?)... which meant long weekend at Camp Creek in upstate New York. A truly amazing time and after driving through rain for almost 3 hours to get there, having near perfect weather the rest of the weekend only made it that much better. Not only did I see some really great sets from Max Creek pretty much all weekend (except for Friday when I was too zonked out to even move out of my camping chair to get up to the stage) and the sets of some&nbsp;other really awesome bands, but I was able to relax so much&nbsp; more than if I had spent a 3 day weekend here at the apartment. Not that chillin' here isnt a blast, because it is, getting away from everything was definately what the doctor ordered as far all the shit I have floating around upstairs in that crazy brain of mine. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun camping at a festival can be if you just let yourself go and take everything in while dropping all your burdens behind. I seriously felt like a new person coming back here and really didnt want to.&nbsp;Being older now, coming back to the everyday grind didnt make me all nuts like when I'd go away for a couple days to hang out with friends or whatever. I used to dread it and it would make me upset and nuts because being away was so relaxing and going back was like returning to the torture chamber. These days it isn't so tough on the emotional state, and I appreciate the time I do have away from my routine a whole lot more. I guess that is why working insane hours isn't as bad as it might seem... because as long as I have my escape, it's all fucking worth it. And its been a blast this summer... prob the best summer so far that I've had compared to any of the&nbsp; previous summers of my life that I can still recall! As I said in my last post... if I'm in my scene nothing else matters and thats damn true, because that spirit was alive and well all weekend up at Creek.   Which leads me to my next topic of discussion... I have decided to end my long obsession of bitching about the opposite sex... damn women... can't live with 'em, can't bury 'em in the backyard... which is something I heard one of my friends say, jokingly of course, a couple years back... and yea it is a take on the tired old cliche, but seriously I'm sick of being a whiny bitch. Yea it sucks I don't have someone around to be with,&nbsp;but so fucking what. No sense in making things worse by rambling on and on about it.   So who cares... what doesn't kill ya, makes ya stronger... yup you know it, I'm cliche boy tonight. Anyway, I've been through far more shit in these regards then I care to discuss and yes I have offered up on quite a few occassions some&nbsp;nuggets of good shit on the whole subject and on other occassions, quite a bit of myself and my past experiences, but I'm tired with it all. I have reached an epiphany and that is, that I am sick of complaining about it and if I don't do anything about it, its my own damn problem and I should shut up or put up. Venting has helped, but the more I think about it, the more I get depressed and start loathing myself. I am sick of feeling down and out when it comes to chicks and all it is doing is making me moody and miserable and real&nbsp;drag to be around. So I'm done. If you hear me bitch about chicks in general, please punch me in the  FAAAAAAACE!  However, I do reserve the right to bitch about particular chicks, when and where they piss me off to the point where I can't deal with it in my overworked, understaffed central processing unit, so as to have to ramble on endlessly via the o'l BLOG. Ok so then it is agreed? Good... so say it again with me... when it comes to bitchin' about chicks these days I say.............................................  FUCK IT!    F...................U...................C................K...................I...................T...................!   &nbsp; I really am a strong person when it comes to this sort of thing. I am around beautiful girls all day long and yet I have gone longer without certain things than I care to even think about, let alone mention here... so I must be either gay or pretty fuckin' patient... and I know for sure I'm definately not&nbsp;playing for the other team. Trust me on this... if I ever watch porn... its gotta be two chicks getting it on&nbsp;b/c I don't need to be&nbsp;seeing any naked dudes... one word.... GGGRRROSS... plus why would I go this crazy over chicks if I was? LOL, so yea I'm a patient, shy person, who has trouble initiating shit when it comes to the ladies... I guess that means I'm prob more shy and lazy, than patient... plus I make excuses instead of just taking that chance....&nbsp;b/c I really am not much of a risk taker, but I slowly gotta get myself out of that if I have any hope of ever getting with a member of the female population again. If not... shit, I'll be alone and frankly I don't like the thought of that, even if I am constantly spouting off about how I'm gonna end up alone. That's pretty much a cry out&nbsp;to the ladies...&nbsp;yo, bitches!&nbsp;I be&nbsp;desperate here... lol... anyway I could talk for another hour or so but its 1:15 am and I started writing half an hour ago which was way past my bedtime already especially considering I gotta get my lazy, tired ass up to be in by 8 am. Can I get an AWWWW YEAAAAH?   alright I'm out. peaaaaaace  &nbsp; quote of the day:  text from Rob at 12:49 pm before he came into work  It's in Olde English style of speaking, mind ye  "Curses! Mine restful slumber doth maketh me late for the daily toil"  my response:  "Thine slumbers be vast and plentiful thee hath best be quite rested"  Can anyone imagine talking like this in real life? I mean seriously, who made this shit up or decided that this was the way to talk? Insane, I tell you...&nbsp;so as a joke and out of sheer and utter boredom, Rob and I try to converse like they used to because often the daily toil be quite dull and commonplace... lol  yes, we are weird... but who isn't?  damn 1:30.... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!   The cellular customer you are trying to reach is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.

      I'm so fucking tired, but I had to post before I get to bed. This has been one weird week... last week was pretty crazy as well and working that 24 hour shift seems to have screwed up my sleeping pattern because I haven't been able to get much sleep lately. That and working 12-13 hr days all last week and this week... its weird because I can do those shifts and still get through them... but mentally I am in this fog and I forget things, I dwell on things, and I have become&nbsp;an emotional and miserable wreck. Thankfully I am escaping for the weekend to Camp Creek up in New York. It's gonna be a blast rain or shine. It will be a chance to just go and be outside and enjoy some really amazing music and be away from here for awhile. I really need it. I am getting sick of this place because it reminds me of how lonely I am. In all honesty, I am happy and having the time of my life and doing so many things despite my crazy work schedule, I just feel the element of having a significant other in my life&nbsp;is missing and it would only make life easier to deal with if I had someone around to get through it with. I'd like to think I am a strong person and despite this void in my life that I have had for so long, I have survived and gotten through all the shit and just enjoyed and lived life, but sometimes you can't handle it anymore... especially with the combination of being overworked, underpaid, and having a serious lack of rest. Which begs the question, what the fuck am I still doing up??? Considering I have so much to do tomorrow to get shit together for this trip, plus the 2 plus hour drive... but when its all said and done and I'm chillin in my camping chair under the stars listening to a nasty 15 min long Creek jam of any one of their songs or covers... it will be damn worth it. Won't even matter that I dont have a girlfriend... I'll be at peace, because thats my scene and in my scene, nothing else matters.   Well I'm out. Hopefully I will not be too tired to post when I get back Sunday night... or Monday night after work b/c I might be too beat to do much of anything when I get back here. Anyway, hope everyone is doing well. Take care and I'll see ya all on the flip side.  PEACE  &nbsp;

      Wow it has been a long time since I've been on here. It seems to be a reoccuring theme don't you think? For some odd reason I will write a post and then a ridiculous amount of time will drift by before I get any sort of inspiration to write. I have no idea why, other than the fact I always seem to be so fucking busy that even if I&nbsp;am wasting time on the computer I can never seem to focus enough to write a post. Not that it isn't good to be busy... I'd rather be busy than bored, but so often I find myself with little time to do other things I miss because I am so busy doing the normal routine and occupied with various other nonsense. Stupid chores, cleaning, laundry, and dishes...&nbsp;boy I am sick of&nbsp;doing that crap.&nbsp;My&nbsp;lazy roomate needs to lend a hand. Another thing is, I seriously could save 5 minutes of my day if the damn cat didn't kick her litter out of the box. As a cat owner, I must accept this normal, yet extremely irritating behavior because thats what they fucking do. Who the fuck knows why, but it happens. Anyway... it would take far less time if the damn broom didnt have to be locked away in the bathroom and kept in the hallway closet. Yes, for those of you who have been to my apartment, the bathroom is a mere 10 feet from the closet, but it is still a pain in the ass to have to go back and forth with the broom just to pick up some damn litter. Yet if I keep the broom in the closet, the cat has the ability to slide open the door, get in the closet and proceed to chew and rip pieces of the broom off and deposit them through out&nbsp;the closet and in various areas of the apartment. This creates a new disaster because then I have to get out the damn vacuum cleaner and&nbsp;suck that shit up. Damn cause and effect. Basically, this is a petty rant, which I have no idea how I got onto, but its little shit like that, that I have to do, not always every day, but enough to cause me serious irritation. Not to mention how I have to keep my own closet in my room barricaded so the cat won't get in there to chew on my shoelaces and then eat them. Its unreal. I love my cat, but because I have&nbsp;to &nbsp;keep practically everything out of her reach and the annoyance it causes me, is like a slow death over a roasting fire... it degrades me day by day especially when I am stressed out. And then she goes and gets her toys stuck under the couch which is impossible to move b/c a) its so freakin heavy due to the pull&nbsp;out queen size bed b) two out of the 4 legs arent held on too well and always fall off so tipping the couch to find her toys doesn't work and c) once you get them out from under there, they get stuck back the very next day. And the crux of it is, she'd rather play and destroy my shit, then the shit I buy for her to play with and destroy b/c thats what it is for!!!!!!!!!!  &nbsp; Sigh ok enough of that... moving on.... again people my brain is weird tonight so I am gonna just go with it. Even though, I have to be up at the ass crack of dawn for the management meeting at work... fun fun joy joy! But seriously, I have no clue where that came from. Ugh. I also work way too much. The cost of living sucks and the fact I get half time supplemental pay for all my overtime hours sucks even more because I have to work that many more hours just to get a decent amount of extra money to help pay the bills and actually be able to have some semblence of a life. Which I do and I am thankful for, it would be nice if I felt like all my hard work was getting me somewhere.&nbsp;Also, time goes by so quickly, it is hard to truely enjoy my free time. That is why I keep myself so busy and I haven't had the time to post. Besides, I was hoping to come back in a better mood according to my last dismal offering. Alas, things haven't gotten any better in the o'l love life... which last time I checked, I really don't have one.&nbsp;&nbsp;I &nbsp;guess the chicks just aren't attracted to this nice guy. I really am starting to believe there is something seriously wrong with me. I have no clue what I am doing and even if I do something in some sense of positiveness (is that even a word? haha) I feel like I am this big doof who should just shut up, go stand in the corner and just accept the fact he is gonna be alone. I guess that is another reason I stay so busy and do so much... gotta keep my mind off of it because when it wanders that way, oh shit look out... miserable I can be! (yes yes cheap Yoda ripoff... uh huh I'm a Star Wars freak... feel better for pointing&nbsp;that out? sure you do! hahaha yup I'm weird) &nbsp; shit laundry should be done brb! 12:30 am &nbsp; Ok I'm back... now to fold and blog at the same time. I don't think it can be done, but we shall see. So yea... the love life, or lack thereof, really has no hope. I honestly don't really have any real possibilities for any happiness in that aspect of my life whatsoever. I think that I am being punished or something... maybe in a past life I got constant booty or something. I don't understand why it is so freakin difficult. I know I am not alone in this fact and that plenty of people go through this, but the fucked up thing is that according to friends and acquaintances I am this great person, who is kind and respectful, hard working&nbsp;and gets along with everyone and is liked&nbsp;by everyone, yet I can't even seem to find one person who likes me and wants to be with me? I know one person who likes me, but she is not here and honestly I don't think will ever be here and even if she did find someway to get here, in the long run it would never work out. I don't want to make her sad because I am sure she will read this, but frankly, I have done the long distance thing and it has never worked for me. At&nbsp;26 years old, I am in no means ready to settle down in&nbsp;any&nbsp;sense of the word, but I am ready for a&nbsp;serious relationship that can only occur with someone who is here. I've been hurt too often to hold out hope for anything these days. I've been let down so many times, that in all honesty, I don't count on anything&nbsp;working out for me&nbsp;anymore and that is sad to say. Sooooo.... that being said... its not like I am giving up on anything at all positive in this aspect of my life, I just dont see anything happening for me. It has been so long since anything at all has happened, so what is there to make me believe things will suddenly get better or change? I have been incredibly patient and enjoyed being single, but I can go only so long without having someone special in my life before I start to go crazy... thankfully I have it somewhat under control, but I am slowly losing it. Ugh... &nbsp; Sorry to cut this off so quickly, but I gotta go before&nbsp;I really start the pity trip in full motion. Its late and I have a clear conscience so I need to hit the sack. I am neither sad nor happy, I am just content. I will be fine... I always am. This rambling isn't to get sympathy or to show you how pathetic I have become, because I am not. I am stronger than this might lead you all to believe, but I am sick of being alone. I am&nbsp;so fucking tired of it. I love my independence, but I'd rather have half as much and have someone to be with as well.  &nbsp; Well&nbsp;I really must be going now. I just heard some disturbing news that Foulke blew another save opportunity for the Red Sox tonight... they better still fuckin win this game or I and every other Sox fan is gonna be so pissed off. Bronson Arroyo pitched another amazing game only to have this shit happen. Sorry Bro, hopefully next time. &nbsp; Ok I'm out.

      Ahhhhh 3:15 am after Creek tonight at the Webster... another pretty good show... def not the best I have been to but as always a stellar performance even despite the lack of really rocked out jamming that is usually the Creek staple. I must say however, that the slower more paced songs were indeed pretty fuckin good, but the Living Room show from two weeks ago was alot more jammed out. All in all any time I see Creek I have a blast and they did play some good songs tonight... one of my favs was a great Me and My Uncle (Grateful Dead cover) as the second song of the night which followed the opener, a great version of Cocaine Lady... the first set ended with a sick version of Trippin' which got everyone moving really fast... also toward the end of the second set they hit up Riders on the Storm (Doors cover) which was completely unexpected and definately a nice treat to top the evening. Normally Creek shows seem to go on forever, but this one seemed alot shorter. I went by myself again, but still had a blast as always... anyway thats it, i gotta hit the sack... gonna try and hit up the beach tomorrow (or later today) if u want to be technical... it will be really chill and relaxing... more than likely it will be packed being the 4th, but whatever! peeeeeace  random quote of the evening:  "riders on the storm riders on the storm into this house we're born into this world we're thrown"  Jim Morrison
