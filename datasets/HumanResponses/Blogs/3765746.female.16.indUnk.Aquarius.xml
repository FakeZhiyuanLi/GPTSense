          Well today was just interesting.  All I really want to say is that I definatly bonded with some friends of mine.  And the 3 of you...you know who you are.  Thank you guys for being awesome friends during it all! I never want to experience anything like that in my entire life ever again! You guys really are amazing!  I'm so glad afterwards when I called Mike to say what happened he was there for me!  I love him so much! Even though he was scared at first to come into my house with my mom mad.  He did and when things got worse he mad me SO MUCH better.  He helped me and made me laugh and stuff. He is the best boyfriend in the world...maybe not for anyone else. And let's hope not.  Because I love him and if he was like that with anyone else...why I auta...grrr...:-D  lol Anywho.  All and all there were ups and downs to today.  And well let's just hope word doesn't get out about you-know-what acaully depending on who you are you don't know what...ha ha poor you.  I love Mikey!

              You can't understand how awesome it is to have my license finally!  I'm exited, yet not.  This all means I have to get a job now.  Which isn't a big thing but I hate having things scedualed for me.  It's strange.  Anyways.  I think finding a car that I like is going to be very very stresfull!  A little too much I bet.  I dred the day.  I can't wait until I'm 18 or my mom trusts me more.  I just can't wait!  For a while it will be good if I want to go get food or like go pick up a friend and go to the mall.  And my mom goes to Iowa in a week! For a week!  UNLIMITED CAR TIME! I mean hey...as long as I don't break to many laws and put gas in it what does it matter?  Dispite what you prolly think i'm acually a great driver.  I think Mike likes driving with me now.  I don't know.  It was really fun though.  He raced my house.  He beat me because he speeds like no other!!!!  When I get a car...It will be faster than his! And louder..he will help me make it louder, but still.  Anyways.  So yeah.  I will be driving a lot for a while.  That's all for now.  TTFN!

           I haven't gone to sleep yet and it's 4:00 in the afternoon. I heard my mom's alarm go off at 5:00am and she didn't get up until around 6!  And she says I push the snooze button too much! I watched the paper guy deliver papers a while before my mother got up. He was in a van driving all swervy like a craZed driver.  It was very amusing. I watched carntoons all through the night and morning. It was cool, when my mother got up I was watching Tom&Gerry and laughing my A$$ off! It was so funny and I'm not sure why. I thought about going swimming but after friday's episode, no. I think i've been chewing the same peice of gum since 8:00 this morning. Because I put it in right after I ate my breakfast which was pizza! I thought it was very cool. I'm feeling a little better today.  My temp is only 99.8 now.  Nobody knows what the normal temprature even is. Oh well. I still have a headache but other than that I'm alright.  I miss Mikey of course. For those of you reading this who don't know, that's my boyfriend...We were talking before he went to work which was about 4:00am.  Then we were texting a little bit and he said he would call after work.  He did, he called when he just got off work and was still there.  This was around 9:00 or so I belive.  And said he was going to do some stuff there, It was prolly to his car or whatever.  Anywho.  So I called him around 1:30 or something and he said he was home and wanted to "freshen up" and then he would come over. Now I am just sitting here.  It's 4:03 now.  Do do do.  I almost read a book. Like I started it, but was to unpatient for Mike to get here.  I have made myself belive he's not coming.  Oh well.  Guess that's just how he is. I still love him.  Scoot and Shanna just came home (sis and almost bro (sis's b/f of like 5 or 6 years)) Anyways.  I'm mad at Scott and he walked in and said hi and I didn't say anything then he walked out of the kitchen and banged his hand on the wall pretty good so I said "ha ha" with no laughter just a simple ha-ha So he goes into his room, well acually it's Shanna's room but who can tell the difference these days.  I can't.  He slammed the door so hard!  I'm not sure if he's having a bad day or was mad because I didn't greet him and then laughed at him.  Either way.  Funny stuff.  So I guess I will make another post later.  I know what's going to happen...I'm going to update this like at least once or twice a day and then it's going to stop for like a few weeks.  And then eventually fizzle out!  Oh well.  Later DayZ!

               I was finally convinced to start a blog.  I blame peer pressure.  No I have started like 5 before this but never remember my link or user name.  Anyways.  Today was a weird day. Acually yesterday...technacly it's Sunday.  But I still feel it's Saturday.  It's 4:30 in the morning. So on Sat.  I woke up feeling bad.  Because the night before was so scary yet so fun!  Me and Mike went swimming in our clothes yesterday(Friday night)...he dared me to jump in and he said If I jumped in with all my clothes he would also.  So I did.  We were swimming for a quite a while. Havin fun in the pool...lots of fun.  I was freezing in there because it was night time and then like 5 min. later started feeling bad....And we were talking and swimming and splashing and stuff...We were messin' around and I passed out right there in the water.  I can't really remember what else happened just that I was in his arms after.  I love him so much.  He baisicly saved my life.  And I guess you can dround in a pool not so big.  Who knew?  Anyways...so i've been scared to go swimmin ever since.  If I do it's going to be with Mikey!  So he can make me un-scared. I can't explain how much I love him.  I just hope he will still take care of me.             So on Saturday continuing on.  After I got out of bed I was so dizzy and sat down, which caused me to stay in bed for like another hour only to do it all over again.  So around 12 I went online.  Got angry that Mikey didn't respond.  Then later got angry he didn't call when he said he would.  I didn't care much.  I didn't call him all day.  I was busy anyways.  I went shopping for my 6,000th day birthday!  It was okay.  I went with my mother and sister so it stressed me out and mad me mad.  I talked to Connie in a store for like an hour!  That was cool.  When I got home I felt sooo bad so I checked my temp and it was only 99.7 or something. I went online. I started talking to Matt K. and untill now I didn't know him all that well and didn't think he said much.  He is acually really cool.  He was trying to take care of me online.  I know he was just bored and didn't really care but I thought it was really nice of him.  He mad me check my temp. like so much.  Which is now only 102.3  So that's normal.  I just feel bad and dizzy and stuff.  It's no fun.  Anyways.  He's really awesome.  It's almost 5:00am now.  And we are both still online talking.  He said he's going to bed when I do. I have an online buddy!  Yay!  Anyways I have to go kick spiderman out of my bed.  Because batman is out here and wants to fight him.  ~Wow longest entry ever.~

I can look out the window and POOF there's the beach! Man oh man its amaZing! I've been seeing hott cali. Boys. Oh wow! I miss Mikey! We've been talking a little. And I asked him to come  down with my sis on Friday till Sunday but he won't go! It's not like he can't...it's that he won't!! How lame is that! Grrr. Oh well. Some other time. No time would be as romantic as this. So. I have been to the beach obviously I mean why not? And I went boogie boarding, body surfing.   And going surfing tomorrow. And tanning on the BEACH. This is the life! There is a webcam that you cansee me at too. IM me when i'm on and i'll give you the sight and go there! It's so cool. Mike saw me there. And my mommy. It's so cool here though. I was swimmin' with seals today. That was cool. I went on&nbsp;a lot of bike rides on the beach cruisers. Speaking of cruse...I saw Tom Cruse. He's cool. Met his little ones. Okay well it's his adopted older son. Same thing. He was at his house he's renting for the week. Also saw the producer of THE O.C. I don't even watch that show!

       I had a great day today! I woke up to Mikey sitting on my bed laughing at my sleeping position. So anyways, I was still really&nbsp;tired and wanted to go back to sleep. So he left and came back with Starbucks! Then I took a shower. Ha ha . Anyways. We went to his house and painted his car primer gray! It was fun. And it was cloudy so it wasn't very hott. Rather nice. We had to get more paint and right when I got back with it the wind picked up plus it was dark so we had to go inside. There was more stuff we did inbetween. The say went well. I packed to leave for Newport! It is going to be a blast! I can't wait to go surfing! I guess I will write when I get back about my trip!

      I meant to write a while back about something that I have already forgot. Oh well. It's all late at night and such. I finally got sleep depervation and had to go to sleep. I stayed up for about 50 hours straight. That's a long time. I finally crashed. The t.v. loured me in. Then all of the sudden ZZzzzZzzzzz. Then I woke up 2 hours later. Ate dinner and Mike came over.&nbsp; It was boring because ALL he talks about lately is his stupid sunburn he got while fishing all day which was his own fault because he didn't wear sunscreen. What an idiot! It's so frikkin annoying! Even on the phone, he just makes ouch noises. Today Connie and Eric came over and we played team UPWARDS against eachother. Like we could all see eachothers letters and were helping out. It was fun.&nbsp;Then Mike came. It got a little less fun because he was being stupid, he was going out of turn and skipping people and messing everything up. I love him but he can be very rude. So I yell and tell him to stop and he pulls me aside and says I only do that around my friends which is NOT TRUE! I only do it when I don't like something and he is being stupid. And he happends to do that more when we are around people. So it's   really   frustrating. He really needs to lighten up and soon! I think a week away from him could be what I need. But if he makes me mad on the phone while I'm there. Oh man. I will jump through the phone and slap him in the face and be all that's a reason to get mad bitch. Not whatever else I just said!!!! I hope Mike hangs with me tomorrow. Connie and I went swimming&nbsp;today in my pool. Muy fun. Then Mike got in. I pulled him in with his clothes on and his stupid sunburn. Very funny. He didn't think so very much. Oh well, he's done it to me. Anyways. So yeah.&nbsp;California is coming soon! Newport beach! Woo-hoo! Can't wait. Surfing, boogie boarding,&nbsp;boys (I love Mikey), beach, water, dolphins, mansion, So much fun already.&nbsp; Wow I wrote a lot. Anyways. OMG I have to pack today! I leave Saturday!

       I backed my car into a cop car the other day. Well he just drove off, sometimes life's OK. I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh what did I say? Well you just laughed it off, it was all OK.     I  consider Connie&nbsp;my best friend!     I have for a while...but now EveryOne can know!

       I spent the entire day with Eric today. Visited Mikey. He looks like a lobster! A read as this... RED!   No joke! It's so funny. David is just maroon. They are both really funny. I acidently patted Mike on the back and he&nbsp;cried like a little girl. That would have been funny but he didn't only made a funny noise. I love him. Wow I don't even remember typing "I love him" Oh well.   -increased sleepiness&nbsp; peak at 12:00  (Have that)  -weariness  (not yet)  -Poor attention and motivation span ,(Have that) &nbsp;especially for boring tasks requiring sustained concentration .(Have it) &nbsp;Watching for freighters would be an example...boring but necessary and dangerous without sustained concentration.  -memory lapses  (as always...but more lately)  -decreased initiative,judgement ability and decision making  (also only more)  -increased irritability.  (Definatly)   -And as Eric says. "The Shadows will start to follow you"  (Not yet.)     I also got to talk to Allen. :-) That was cool.&nbsp;So anyways. The day was really fun. Thank you Eric. For the great day.

      Did I not predict that this would happen! I would stop writting for a long time and then I would all the sudden start again. Ha. I knew it.&nbsp;So anyways, things have been going o.k. It's weird. Mike and I had some fun today. First time in a while we didn't argue the ENTIRE day! That was new. We are getting beter I guess. And I am also changing for him. A poem I wrote...&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Someone Else      Have you ever wished that you were someone else?      Someone other than yourself.      Have you ever wanted to get away?      To be someone else for just one day.      Does it seem like your lane is always jammed?      and everything you do is always dammed?      Do you always seem to catch the red light?      and never seem to do anything right.      Do you try to make everyone happy, not sad?      but someone always ends up mad?      If I changed my name,      would you still be the same?      If I changed my face,      how would I see&nbsp;this place?      If I changed my beliefs,      would my mind be anymore deep?      If I was someone else,      would I wish I was myself?      &nbsp;~Laina~      &nbsp;   To take my stuff means you have taste. But it takes NO SKILL to copy and paste  This poem means a lot to me. So the sleepover. Connie and I spent the night at Jenny's house. It was really fun and funny. Man, my cheeks hurt at one point. At other times it was starting to get stressful because there was so many new rules that seemed like they were being made up. I know they were prolly real, but most people don't play with them. It's a lot better. I like playing UNO when the person who wins just gets a tally, that way it's not based on luck of how many cards the other player has. It's your strategy to win. That's just my theory. Anyways. We played mad-libs. It was so much fun and very funny. Also we swam. There were a lot of roaches in the Palm Shack (the place jenny and I built) It's cool. Well there werent that many in there. But on the outside. Because Jenny has Palm tree's and that's where they like to live. I don't get roaches at my house. Because I think they live down the street with all the palm trees.&nbsp;And I don't have big spiders. Or anything yukki. So anyways. Mikey fixed his car. It doesn't over-heat anymore. Very happy and safer to drive in. I hope we can have another sleepover again. Maybe at my house next time. Don't know when. Should have had one while my mom was away. But I didn't think of it. Oh well. Someday....Someday.

      Today was Jenny's surprise party, I think it went well. It sure helped me get my mind off of things. I felt a lot better. I was laughing and having fun. It was just what I needed.&nbsp;I had a lot of fun. Mikey was bothering me a ton. But I didn't let it bother me that much.&nbsp;I have to babysit tomorrow. Sara Jade. She is so adorible. It will be fun. And I get paid! Yes. I really need to get a job if I want a car, yeah? Anyways. I'm glad I wasn't moping around all day. Maybe I will choose to stay here after all. She can wait i'm sure.  R.I.P. Kristi Diana Olsen.  Thank you all who have helped me thru this.

      There are so many things that you just can't help. So many people that don't have anything close to what you do. There are people who die because they think they should or they have to. None of it's fair. It's not even close to right. There are some people who just know things. There are some people who can see what no one else can. I wish I could have helped. I wish I could have been there to stop it.&nbsp;Why did it have to happen? Why does God have to act in such strange ways? I know not everyone believes in God, but I do. Even when he takes a life away. She took her own life, although he let her. It's just really sad to think about the pain. I wish everyone could live in happiness. I know that's not even close to happening but a girl can dream can't she.

      Today not a lot happened. I finally got to watch "You got served" with Mikey. It was a good movie. Ya all should rent it. Right after that he left. and didn't come back untill a long time later. He said he would come back and hang out but he said he lost track of time. When he came back I took his hat. :-) I still have it. And I intend to keep it. He says he will get it back tommorrow....but I don't think so.  tocoolevenforyou: im not trying to get you guys to break up but isn't the point of a b/f so you can hang out with them alot and share a common intrest and not get annoyed with them, i mean thats why i broke up with danielle she annoyed me  I am going to get my good self back again. Long story and I don't want to type it. Today I got a new rug. It looks very cool in my room which I cleaned. I just have to clean off my bed now. I will prolly do so right now. Yeah. That's what I will do.

      My mom just got home. I cooked her dinner before she got home. My sister is freaking lazy so I had to clean the entire house myself. Mike made me paint my nails. Wow. He was over but David called and needed to be picked up so he left. And he said he might be back. Whatever. I wanted to watch "You got Served" with him. And last night he said he would hang out with me today. And he isn't. Nothing new. I hate my sister. She is a flucking nosey bitch. She's like your writting to someone, who are you writting to. And obviously i'm not writing to anyone. I get angry before she speaks. I get mad when she walks into a room....so Connie you're not alone.

          Well I ended up going to bed when the sun got up. And then I was woken up by David calling me to talk about how sad he was that Patrichia is leaving. He cares for her a lot! So I went back to sleep...I was almost asleep when what do you know, it's the phone again.  This happened everytime I was almost alseep like 6 times and like 4 different people. Wow. So I was so tired but had to get up since there was no hope in going back to sleep. So I got up and went to drop off Mikey's phone at his house. I was suposed to be on my way to Connie's but got distracted with part of a movie. So when I finally made it to Connie's house Jeff Axton came over and we went to TCBY which is an ice cream shop and ate some ice cream there. I've never been there. But it's pretty yummy. I will have to remind myself to bring Mike there. Went back to Connie's to finish the pillows. They look Splended if I do say so myself! (By the way Connie, Jenny doesn't have this link yet) I also made this thing for Mikey. It says "Mike" in all cool letters and colored neatly. I really like it. I hope he keeps it! If he doesn't I would be sad.  While we were making the pillows Mike called me and told me not to go anywhere because it was stormy out but it should get better. He wanted me to call him if I was getting ready to leave. I thought it was so sweet! After Connie's I drove to Mike's, where I helped him fix his car. Muy fun...not. Boring, but I get to see Mike so who cares. We went to one of his friends houses and then went to my place and layed and watched t.v. for a while. Then ummmm. What the heck. Ummm then I think we went to Jack In The Box. We did but I mean i'm missing something. Oh well. After we went there. We ate at my house. Watched more t.v. and he went home around 11:15pm. I had an exiting day. Lots of fun with Connie Bunny.  Then I took a shower and here I am now.

      In no order of importance...  1.When people say your name wrong and you correct them like 3 different times and they keep getting it wrong! 2.When people say hi on your AIM and an AWAY message come up and then they ask if your there...DUH! Obviously not. 3.People who don't care 4.People who read this and do what it says I don't like. 5.When people freak out about something not being 100% clean. Like if you smash a little tiny bug and they yell at you to wash your finger! grrr. 6.When your really comfy but also really thirsty and don't want to get up to get a drink.  I will add to this list more and more.

       Today on the 11th. I have horrible timing with these. It's always like 5-15 min off. Like so it's the next day but I haven't gone to sleep yet so it's still today. Anyways. It was 1/2 year and Mike and I went out. First we went to StarBucks and got frapichino's then we went to my house for a little bit. Then we went to Swenson's to eat. It was fun. We told stories, he drove my car to his house where we stayed and watched Harry Potter. I love going to his house. We are ALWAYS at my house and I hate it. Which reminds me I need to clean my room because he is coming over tommorrow. :-) I love him so much. We bearly argued today. Only over little things like the radio. It was funny. Reminder cassius7891...add to GunBound buddy list. Anyways. Mike and I are hanging out again tomorrow. I don't know where. I hope we have fun whatever we do. Maybe I will cook and make him eat it! Mwahahahahaaaaaa!!!!!! Well I'm out.

          Everything has been pretty okay lately. A lot of little things happening with Mike. His car keeps getting more wrecked my those fuckers who jumped him. If I knew what their car looked like, or them I would take em myself! OooOooOo it would be bad. So anyways. I have just been marinatin' pretty much. Going a lot of places. Being stressed. Umm today is Mine and Mike's Half a year anniversary.  I made him mad yesterday...So I went to party city and got him a dozen balloons and but them all over in his room when he wasn't home. They all said something different. I love him but everyone that saw me with him today was calling him a jerk and a dick to his face. I hope he got a clue from all that. So yeah. I drank for the first time in a really long time. It was fun. Me n' the people I was with had a blast! My driving is doing good. I haven't had any mishaps. I just need to de-stress. I hope it happends soon. After tomorrow I think Mike and I need a little break. Not like you are thinking, not a break-break. Just like still see eachother everyday but not as long. I need to go back to hanging out with my friends instead of blowing them off for Mike. I love all my friends to death. I shouldn't be more involved with boys. "Chicks before dicks!" I need to remember that. But Mike needs to know that I should be someone who is important in his life. And if he keeps being a jerk I have to do something. I'm not sure what to do. So if anyone has any idea's please comment on this entry...thank you.

      I had fun today...I went to see a movie with somebody I haven't talked to or seen in a long time.  So we had some fun! ;-) Saw dodgeball. The movie was okay...but I wasn't paying attention much.  Like nobody was there so me and my friend were just like laughing and having fun. It was funny. So after that I saw Mikey on the road and followed him. And then he came to my house, then I took him to get a hair cut...it was too long :-/ he he. So after that we went to DQ but I didn't get anything, he Shanna and Scott did. So yeah. Mike and I had fun later on! It was really good. We both fell asleep on my bed for a while. Then he went home. Around 11:08 I picked up Eric from his house! :-) he is over.  In Soccer...   There are no timeouts There are no helmets No shoulder pads No commercial breaks No halftime extravaganza So if thats what you need Go play football  YOU BIG WUSS!

             Used to think I had a good boyfriend...but I'm not going to say anything right now. I dropped Mike off at his car and he was going to follow me home.  He was following me home on Coral Gables and all the sudden sped past me and flipped me off and shook his head...I don't know what the frick I did.  Then he passed my house and I started to cry but stopped myself because I don't think that's too safe while driving.  So I drive to Jake's where we were supposed to go, he's not there.  I call him and he's like "fuckin' Laina"...real fast and hangs up.  I DID NOTHING!  Honestly!  We were totally fine! Compleatly.  And all of the sudden he is a loser! Then I call his phone and David answers and he says that those guys were following him again. I was like that does not explain the whole flipping off thing or not going to my house.  You see if he followed me home like he said he would, things would have been fine. But their not so oh well. I was so mad when I got home. Slammed doors and then ripped that stupid ring that's his off my neck. Broke my own necklace and threw the ring. I don't know where it is and I really don't care. There is no reason for his actions at all. He has a lot of explaining to do. And I give him no sympathy if he gets jumped again. He is a jerk and deserves it if he wants to be that mean. I'm going to go drink because that's one thing that pisses him off. LaTeR!

          Today I got to spend the entire day almost with Mikey...it had it's ups and downs...we went a lot of places.  It was fun, stressful, sad and yeah.  Wow.  It was an emotional roller coaster in one day...and more than one ride on it!  Anyways.  I love him so much and i'm really really glad that he's such an understanding and forgiving boyfriend...not like I did anything bad.
