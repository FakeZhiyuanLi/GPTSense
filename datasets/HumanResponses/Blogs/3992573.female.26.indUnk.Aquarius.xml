         ok so i just don't understand men. it's later on in the day because i just haven't had a chance to blog today, and it's really not because i was busy working because to be honest i haven't done a damn thing all day & ya know what? i don't give a shit! it's just that kind of day.       so last night was fine, didn't end up going to dinner with meta because he had to do some shit with the DNC. and i really couldn't get mad over that because for the 1st 2 years that we were together he didn't work so the fact that he's actually working now is a big deal so i can't get mad when he's doing work related stuff. so i just went home &amp; cooked supper & chilled there.        so today comes around. he calls me at like 12:30 we talk for like 10 minutes &amp; then he tells me that he has to go to the boston pops concert that he was supposed to be going to last night but didn't go because it was rained out & postponed until tonight. so i was like oh well when did you find out that it was postponed? and he tells me that he found out when he met up with his boys last night. so i was like YOUR BOYS? meaning your friends were there &amp; that's why you blew me off? and i then went into a frantic rage.....well he shuts me up & asks me why the hell would he lie about something that i could so easily find out about? how the hell am i supposed to know? so he says whatever then you wanna go tonight? and i was like no i don't wanna go because i am not about to be fit into your schedule. and he was like ya know what here i am trying to make this better, trying to find time to spend with you &amp; what the hell are you doing? yelling at me because i chose the wrong words, it wasn't my friends, it was my boss, kirsh, their mothers & my mom....OH. so in the meantime i email choclate kisses &amp; tell her to hurry up & check via if the concert was really cancelled last night so she emails back saying that she doesnt understand....UGH. i am trying to find out if this arguing is worth it &amp; she doesn't know.....AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH       so anyhow, i continue to argue & he was like ya know what instead of me being rude i'm just gonna say bye &amp; call me back later because i don't want to fight with you over nothing. so i was like whatever maybe i won't call you back at all & he says fine &amp; hangs up....it's not 2 1/2 hours later & he's ignoring my calls. oh did i forget to mention that after i hung up the phone &amp; started ranting to chocolate did she tell me that she heard that the concert was cancelled this a.m. on the radio HELLO! omg he wasn't even lying. i yelled & i screamed &amp; he wasn't eveb lying. pick your battles natty....damn it. now i'm trying to call him & he won't answer because i rearranged all of my plans for tonight so that i could go to dinner with him &amp; he's not answering.       so i'm gonna keep calling him....we will see what happens tomorrow.          &nbsp;    HASTA MANANA!

         good morning everyone!! here i am in another day. i am not that tired today which is a good thing, funny how that extra 10 minutes from the snooze actually can make you feel so much better! but then after that p ends up being in the bathroom so i have to either knock on the door & get annoyed by him, or just go into the hall bathroom. which is the route that i have taken for like 2 weeks now. i just moved the toothbrush, toothpaste &amp; bruch in there....whatever. it's way too early to argue with him about that.        so last night i saw meta. i picked him up at his mothers house & we were going to go out to dinner. well i go &amp; pick him up & he tells me that he needs to go by his grandparents house to say bye to his family that came here from FL. so i said that was fine &amp; then he starts telling me that i have to go inside with him because i need to meet these people. so i asked the simple question....what am i meeting them as? i mean come on now i'm not his girlfriend so what exactly will i be meeting them for? what is the relevance? well that started an argument. so i pull up to the house & he went in &amp; i waited in the car. no sooner did the door close behind him did his grandmother come out & literally yell at me to go inside. so i call J as i'm doing this because, well just because i had to tell her about the craziness that was occuring. so i go inside &amp; we hung out for a while & then i finally said to him ok are we leaving so we can go &amp; eat? and he's like yeah i all ready told them that we had reservations so we're straight to go. we didn't have reservations but that's not really the point. we haven't really seen eachother since the weekend before the 4th & we wanted to spend some time together, damn i have to explain myself. anyhow, so we get up to leave &amp; she freaks out asking us why we were going & we're we too good to sit down &amp; eat with them & blah blah blah. so he asks me if it was that big of a deal if we ate there &amp; i of course said hell yes. i wanted to go out somewhere where we could be one on one, but now we were going to be stuck in PR all night! and then she starts, i never see my grandson, he's never here & when he's here he's with you yada yada yada. now as she's saying this all that was going through my mind was well shit i never see him either so i guess we both have points. so finally he tells me that if we stay there to eat then we'll go out on wednesday night. whatever. so i go outside to move the car because it was in the middle of the road. well they live on a frigen dead end with 4 houses on it. so i went to find a space, oh i found one....on the next street over.&nbsp;oh did i forget to mention that as i was closing the&nbsp;door she asks me oh is the restaurant closing? is it the last night that you guys could go there? nice.&nbsp;so i go back inside & we started eating &amp; then the grilling came. and i'm not talking about steaks......so when are you 2 going to get engaged? when are you going to move in together? when are you going to have a child? HELLO! CAN WE ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP HERE FIRST & THEN MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT MARRIAGE? UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.        so we finish over there &amp; we're driving back home & he says to me thank you so much for doing that babe, you didn't have to deal with that. and thank you for helping them pick up. lemme explain that. we all finished eating &amp; automatically all the guys got up & walked into the living room, well he grabs my hand to go with them but all the ladies started helping with the cleaning. so what the hell was i supposed to do? go in there &amp; sit with all the guys? yeah that would have made me look really good. so i helped out. not that it took long at all because there were literally like 10 of us doing it. but i guess that made a difference in some way, ok. so i go to drop him off at his mother's he asked if i wanted to come in & after making out for a while we both decided that it just wasn't a good idea because he really can't do anything yet. he's in a frigen sling &amp; a brace across his back. not to mention the stiches aren't even healed yet. so yeah going inside not a good idea. so he goes upstairs i go home & pass the hell out because it's midnight by then and oh yeah i'm up at 5.       so all &amp; all it was a good night.       now let's see what happens tomorrow night.          &nbsp;    : )

        ok so here i am...again. it's monday again & i realized today that i need to be getting to sleep at like 8 if i want to feel refreshed. but then again, i got like 10 hours of sleep on friday night &amp; was still tired. probably the cold i am trying to kick.&nbsp; and yes i know what your thinking, how can i have a cold in the middle of the summer, but that's what happens to me, i get sick in the summer. even though meta doesnt want to understand or believe that, whatever!      anyhow, the weekend was good, tiring but good. friday i left this place & went home, had a wax appointment at 7 with f then went to dinner with the fam. left there &amp; went over j's for a bit & decided that i should have gone straight home &amp; to bed, i was home by 12 & in bed by 1201. woke up at like 1030 sat morning &amp; cleaned the hell out of the entire house. talked to meta for 2 hours about absolutely nothing other than the fact that i haven't seen him in way too long. i miss the big head. then f came home & we ran some errands. went back home &amp; prepared for yesterday (p's party) then went over joe's. we had chinese & hung out. he was bartending at RED that night so he left i picked a up from work &amp; we went out. stopped at RED & got all drunk for free then walked down to octaine, drank some more, then on the rocks for reasons which i still dont know. i hate that place &amp; everytime i go there i realize more & more why! it's just a bunch of euro trash.....wait sorry wanna be euro trash. there is a difference. then we went home ate something &amp; all passed out.      sunday morning i went back home early to help with the rest of the party preperations. we finished all the food, put up the decorations & touched up everything. people started coming at 2. p, dad &amp; the boys got home around 330 & he was so surprised. his whole family came &amp; we just had a really really nice day. after everyone left at like 9 he was opening his gifts & he got all teary eyed &amp; was telling me how shocked he was that everyone came & that so many people care about him. ya know as much as he's a pain in my ass he's a great guy, wonderful heart. i hope some day that i will find a man who cares half as much about me as he does to my sister &amp; their daughter. i can't believe i said that because he gets on my nerves so much, but boil it all down & he is a great person with an even better heart.     and that's how it's all ending for the weekend.     supposedly meta is coming back home tonight (we'll see what actually ends up happening) he was being really&nbsp;good on the phone today. only a few add moments with the t.v. and radio because my baby just can not concentrate on more than 1 thing at a time.&nbsp; although he did tell me that i was his responsibility, which i didn't get....oh well.       &nbsp;   hasta manana!       &nbsp;   : )

        ya ya ya i know i know, its ridiculously early, but hey this is what time i get into work, so this is the time that your going to have to deal with reading this! anyhow, last night was o.k. i got out of here went by yeya f's house, quick lesson in greek, yeya is greek for grandmother, yeah i'm greek. anyhow, i left there & went home, it was nice because p was the only one home with the baby. mom &amp; f went to shop for sunday (p's surprise party) and who knows where dad went. but saw that i wasn't feeling well & was good enough to not leave the baby with me because i really didn't want to be holding her because i'm sick &amp; i don't want to get her sick. ok quicky about the living situation. mom, dad, f (sister), p (brother in law) & z (their baby) ya we all live together. we just built an addition onto the top of our house where they will evetually live, when it's done &amp; at this point it doesn't seem like it will ever be but he's shooting for the fall so we'll see. it's a great big happy damn family so don't judge it unless you know! i love them all don't get me wrong, but damn sometime i don't feel like talking, i don't feel like entertaining everyone, but if i'm quiet for like an hour oh what's the matter? are you upset? sometimes i am, but most of the time it's just because i don't want to frigen talk! but the situation is just for now. i have been saving my pennies & want to move out on my own very soon. i have been ready for a while but i don't want to end up moving out &amp; struggling, i'm just being smart right now about it. because once i move out i don't want to go back! so anyways, they all came back home after a while & brought thea (aunt that's visiting from greece for theos wedding next weekend) theo (my mothers brother) we had dinner &amp;amp; then jo called. i went & picked him up &amp; he came over for dinner. jo is my best friend. jo is gay & i love him to death. he &amp; i were "dating" for a few months until he came out to me & told me that he was bisexual, i knew don't get me wrong, but the whole dating thing quickly ended at that point &amp; we've been best friends ever since! well he came over we had dinner & coffee &amp; that was it. it was ok, but i was just so tired & in so much pain that i didn't want anyone there, but they were there so i made the best of it.      so anyhow, now the weekend is here, thank god! i felt that this week would really never ever end. it's just been hard not feeling well, working, going for that damn mri yesterday which had to have been the worst experience ever! i just can't wait to not do anything for once. but i can almost bet my life on the fact that i will be bothered to help f with the party because well as much as i love my sister she is just incapable. you will quickly learn to know this as the days progress.      until monday.....        &nbsp;    : )

        ok so here it is, my second blog..yeah i know dont get so excited all at once. anyhow, i just realized that i havent told anyone about me! well here's my deal, i have no "man" i have a meta (and for those of you who don't know, thats ok you'll have to deal with it. he & i have been "together" for 4 years in october known eachother for 7. i have no clue where it will go or when it will end but for now its good. i love him &amp; all, but he just confuses the hell out of me so i'm not worrying about labeling us anymore, we are what we are & what that is i have no idea. and then i have my pl. now for those of you who are really into this blogging thing then you will know what that is, for those of you who don't pl stands for prison love.&nbsp;mine has been down for 5 years now with about 2 more to go. it sucks. but that's ok because i make my girl come with me to ease the pressure a little bit. but to be totally honest with you i am really starting to get sick of it. he thinks that he knows everything & the reality of it is is that if he did know anything he wouldn't be where he is as we speak! but he is &amp; that's the reality. but it's just starting to get on my nerves. plus the more that i think about it the more i realize that i would have no life with him when he gets out so what the hell is the point? i need things & his whole perspective is that why would you need anything other than food, water &amp; shelter? oh ok african rasta king, my bad, i must have been the one who had 15 pairs of tims & separate socks that went with each one of those. and i was the one that had the&nbsp;5 avirex leathers that went with the 5 pairs of sneakers that you owned just for the coats...oh lets not even try to get into the sneakers, sneakers for every day of the week, every outfit, season, playing ball, playing ball outside, playing ball inside, playing ball outside/inside in the winter/summer. and trust when i tell you that these were all different sneakers...but i'm materialistic? oh my bad!      ok my bad, i just took like a 4 hour break from this & just realized that i had to finish it!! that's just the kind of person that i am though so deal with it.      anyhow, i think that i have wasted enough of my time writing about big I.      j &amp; i just went to the po (privacy office) & we each got a pl (prison letter) and i have been releived of my duties for this saturday (halelujia just sang out through everywhere) supposedly my beloved has a special visit. whatever, better for me.      anyhow, i guess that i should work now, all is well, julias not having to take a ride in the accord to the you know where to do the killings, i dont have to go the pl on saturday oh &amp; FYI meta still hasnt called me......OH        &nbsp;    LOVE YOU ALL : )

         yeah yeah yeah i know, it's been a few days since i've blogged, but hey i actually have work to do sometimes when i'm at work, so i didn't get a chance to do it, stop harrasing me!       anyhow, what's happened since the last time i blogged hmmmmmmmm. oh ok we'll start with friday. i came here (obviously) left here & went home. then i picked j up &amp; we got take out & ate &amp; hung out at my house for a bit then i took him home. i swear i got back home at like 10 & went straight to bed i was so damn tired for some reason. then saturday i went to go see big I. we had a really good visit for once actually. i think that we're both coming to the terms that this is actually going to end at some point &amp; i think that we're actually both ok with that. i mean honestly though how long was this really going to last? we both knew that it would eventually come to a hault. but i didn't think that it would be so easily done ya know? i mean i really thought that i cared about this kid, but now looking back on it, it was just something that i was so used to doing that made me keep going. i hate change, everyone who knows me knows that. but i think that this will actually be good. so i'm most likely going to continue to go up there for a while until i feel that i'm ready for a clean break. because i know myself was too well & i know that if i try to cut it right at the seams right now i'll fall back to him quickly. so i need to pace myself. slowly but surely it will end. so then i came back home &amp; the sister asked me to watch the baby so that they could go to the movies. sure why the hell not. no actually i didn't mind at all because i knew that i wasn't going anywhere for a while so i didn't care. so they came home i went over j's house & we had dinner. then i picked a up from work, we went back home got ready &amp; went out. we had a good time actually. we met s & m (ha i just realized those initials!) at the sole for drinks then her &amp; i went to the hot spot. we had fun. then chocolate calls me & tells me the drama with her man (yes again) i don't honestly know what the hell is wrong with that man. i swear i just wish that she would let me talk to him &amp; make him open his eyes to her. he's so damn dumb. whatever though. then on sunday we went to the movies, the italian festivle then to dinner. so all in all it was a really nice weekend.        yesterday was insane here for some reason too. i don't know why. actually i do know why, it's because monday's are just like that, but yesterday it seemed like every 10 minutes someone was at my desk. hey i can't complain though at least i have a job which is so much more than a lot of people can say. and it's a plus that i like my job that i have too!       so mom & dad are going to greece too for a month. they just came back last night from the cape from the weekend &amp; all that their waiting for is their new passports to come in so that they can get their tickets & all that stuff. dad is a little pissed because he wanted to be there when the olympics are going to be there but what can you do? like i said, being in greece after the olympics is better than not being there at all! i'm happy that their going to go though. they need it. also, we're waiting for the business to come back about the hot dog place. i swear i am praying for that place. not as much as i'm praying for the other dip shit to fall flat on his face with the pizza place, but we need something trust me. so everyone reading this, say a silent prayer for us that this goes through.       anyhow, i guess i should do something here now.               HASTA MANANA!              : )

         ok so we finally went to dinner last night! meta & i that is. it was nice actually, well other than the fact that we had another "talk." it's so weird between us like that. i mean we'll be fine for as long as we are &amp; then i get thoughts & need to talk. and i know that it pisses him off cause last night he swore up &amp; down that he was never, ever going to have a talk like that with me ever again unless we're discussing when we're gonna have kids....um hello? kids? hold up baby your not even my man, but now we're talking about kids? oh. but all in all it was very nice. i like being with him, no matter how annoyed he gets me. i still like being there with him. he makes me feel safe. almost like nothing can go wrong. and i know that he cares about me, i know that for a fact. but the thing is is that he says that he can't commit himself right now because he'll end up cheating & he doesn't wanna do that. oh so this way you can do whatever the fuck you want &amp; not feel guilty? hmm must be nice! then he freaks out, no that's not what i mean. so i said look whether you wanna admit it or not, you & i are more than just friends, i know that relationships freak him out, i know that, but like it or not, this is what it is. and he tells me that he doesn't want to think about that. ok then don't think about it. so i ask him if he has been with anyone else &amp; he starts laughing. hi i'm a joke now? so i asked him why he was laughing & he tells me that he doesn't even talk to other girls why would he be with anyone else? and furthermore, if he wanted to be with someone in any way why wouldn't he just be with me? ok are you asking me or telling me? but whatever. we had a nice time. i want to spend more time with him but it's just so hard. he's not living here &amp; all. damn getting older sucks. having to deal with shit like this is gross. plus i want him to go to law school which he is going to do next september. he'll be around for 1 year & then he'll transfer to a better school where he can major in the type of law that he wants to practice.  i want him to go through with his plan & not back track. so i guess that i just need to suck this up for now. and in the mean time keep doing what i've been doing. i love him too much to let him go. plus, as sick as it may seem, i actually think that, sorry, i know that i could spend the rest of my life with him. omg i can't even believe that i just said that. but him &amp; i started off as friends, so as a friend i need to be there for him....that's my decision, mature huh? yeah i know.       and the best part of the evening...doing the things behind a fucking tree behind circuit city....WHY! hell after 4 martinis i think i would have done him in the damn booth!              anyhow, i'm out. have a great weekend, cause i know i will! plus white girl is coming back from vacation on monday, so we'll all be 1 big happy family here again....yeah right.              HASTA LUEGO!!

       ok so why do we really need to be at this place again? there are so many other things that i could be doing right now....like sleeping. but no. instead i'm here trying to figure a lot of shit out. i don't even know where my mind is lately, but i have been really trying to figure shit out & it's really not as easy as it seems like at all! ok so the 1st thing is that i want to be with someone. i don't know who that person is right now at this time or anything like that, but i know that i am now ready to be with someone. i want to get married, i want to have children, i want to have a normal life ya know? but then the more that i think about it the more i realize that i don't know if that's what i really want. because ok look at this, white girl has been with her man for what like 9 years? has 2 kids with him, lays next to him on a nightly (well unless either of them is on the couch for the night) but the point is, she still doesn't trust him. and that sucks. i mean she is 1 of the nicest people that i know in this fucked up world, and she doesn't have piece of mind. i mean deep down i know that she knows that he would never do anything to hurt her. but the bottom line is that she is basically married to someone that she doesn't trust. is that how i'm gonna end up? and i gonna end up lonely &amp; afraid? god why.   and then on the other hand we have chocolate kisses. damn it she's my girl but i wanna take that big ass man & slap him so fucking hard that his rose bush giving mother feels it! i just wanna be like hello asshole do you have any idea what you have with her? damn both of them for that matter, they have no clue what they have in these women!   ugh i don't know. maybe it's just my mood today, but my eye won't stop twitching &amp; these thoughts won't get out of my head.   i need to go to dinner with meta so he can make me feel better. maybe it's also because i haven't done the things in like a month & it's starting to get to me. i just need something or someone to change my thoughts to better ones. and he can usually do that......   let's pray that it happens.      HASTA MANANA!      : )

       ok so i was really going to do more yesterday, but here i was actually doing my work when frigen spoon comes over to introduce the new girl to me, yeah hi, then she tells her that she'll be sitting with me for the rest of the day..shit. i totally forgot that C said that she would be sitting with me. damn it. i didn't even prepare anything for this bitch to do. now i'm gonna have her crawled up my ass all day. wtf. so whatever. she comes back & sits down, yeah b get comfortable. i explain everything that i do to a girl who has no clue about anything that i'm saying. then she starts. she tells me about her fiance, his mother who they live with, the fiance's mothers fiance that lives there too. how she got locked out of the house last week, how her fiance &amp; her had a 10 year anniversary party for themselves. how the mother's fiance is a crackhead. all damn day people. this went on all fucking day. i was so happy when 12 came along because she went to lunch. i would have gone with her but couldn't stand the thought of listening to more. i don't know you chica, chill the hell out with telling me your life story! so she goes to lunch, comes back & then goes to training until 3...oh good i leave at 4, we're just gonna have her sit with you until you leave, yeah that's exactly what i wanted. ugh.       anyhow, chocolate kisses had a horrible day too. she basically got told that she doesn't do her job well & that she's too slow. oh and that her &amp; i have a conspiracy towards private ryan. ok # 1 bitch we can like/dislike any frigen person that we want. # 2 shut the fuck up. leave us the hell alone & let us do our work whatever way we get it done! nah instead their crawled so damn far up her ass that they can't even see daylight. let it go. so now we're back to not being able to talk anymore at work. it's happening again. so that's fine. we don't talk when we're here. we talk after work &amp; on breaks. fine. ugh.      so i leave here all annoyed & was going to the gym &amp; a calls me. oh i missed you so much blah blah blah. so i was like look whatever man, all that i know is that you guys dicked me. so if you want to be freinds with julia, we are not chillin with her when i am around. you can do whatever you wanna do with her, but minus me. she says fine. fine. so we go to the gym. on the treadmill great fun, daron walks by. FYI daron is, well, was my 1st, 1st everything. i love him. we were together for 4 years & it never actually "ended" we just stopped talking. but i would still meta his ass. no bullshit. so i say hi to him. well as we're walking away from the treads he was talking to some guy on another one &amp; says hey n i wanted to talk to you about something. so i stopped & was like right now? and he's like oh nah not unless your leaving right now. and i was like nope i have a couple of machines to do still so he's like oh ok then i'll catch up with you. and i said ok &amp; walked away. so i'm on another machine & he comes over to me &amp; asks me why i keep winking at him because he doesn't know how to take it. i started laughing & asked him how he wanted to take it &amp; he was like oh i don't know. so i said look don't go down a road that you don't wanna go down. and he was like if i didn't want to go down that road i wouldn't be talking to you right now. OH BITCH. so i asked him what he wanted to talk to me about & he tells me that he wanted to get my number to see if i wasn't busy at some point this week. so i said fine &amp; gave him my cell #. OH BITCH. so he was like well are you busy tonight? and i had to say yeah because i was watchin the baby for f & p. but i told him to definately give me a call if he could get out of the house this week you know baby mom's &amp; all. and he was like if you give me a reason to leave the house then i would. oh. so i started laughing & just told him to call me. ok i'm flirting. i'm flirting with daron b. oh. good. now i will die. i'm sorry did either of us not get enough ass beatings when we were together that we have to go back to eachother? wow. it's so weird he has like this magnetic pull with me &amp; i just don't know why. but this is the way that i see it. if a man can see your ass at the gym, therefore at your worst time, and still try & holla, he's not goin anywhere. but then again he's seen my actual ass so i can't really say anything about that! so let's see if he has the balls to call me. cause i will answer.      and my poor meta wants to try & do dinner this week again "if i don't act up" oh i act up now. ok i'm just gonna let that go because i don't want to start something that was my fault initially. but he's taking the fact that i apologized about something he is taking to his head. so he keeps bringing it up. let it go baby. i will say this honestly though. i do miss his ass. i just want to be with him for a while to get my fix &amp; then i'll be straight. i just miss him. yeah i know i sound corny but whatever.      now i am going day by day because mom & dad are very serious about going to greece for 3 weeks WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO      ugh i will blog more tomorrow i gotta work.      hasta manana       : )

       ok so it's monday again. yeah i know i didn't get to blog on friday but i had way too much work to do. it was so weird last week, it was like i was working my ass off but didn't seem to be getting anything done! but it's a new week, it's going to be a good one too, i can feel it!   so the weekend....well friday night i went to go too Big I. chocolate kisses was supposed to come with me to see Big Cherb but she lost her i.d. & even though i told her to still come because they would have let her in regardless she didn't want to risk coming up there &amp; having to sit in the waiting room & waiting for me. even though i told her that they would still let her in she didn't want to listen to me. and low &amp; behold when i got up there to co that was there told me that it was more than ok as long as she was with me she would have been fine.....OH. anyhow, the visit was ok i guess. it's really weird actually. as much as i am mad at him, as aggravated whatever i just can't stay mad at the kid for some reason. and just as i was thinking that he said the exact thing to me! it was really weird. but i stayed for a while, left there went home hung out there for a while then went to bed. saturday was theo's wedding so i was up at 7 to go get my nails done. then i went home showered & went to get my hair done. in the meantime jes tells me that julia invited a &amp; j to the beach house for the weekend. hmmmm that's interesting no one said anything to me about the beach, nice. so i go get my hair done & ask j if he's going &amp; he says i don't know maybe, i just need to get away....oh because doing hair is a stressful job, yeah i get that. so whatever. we go to the wedding & it was ok i guess. it just didn't seem like a wedding reception for some reason. i don't know. j never showed up some bullshit excuse that he didn't have a car. i swear the kid tells so many lies that he probably doesn't even know his own name. so after the wedding i go home change &amp; went over there. julia was there that stupid jealous bitch & j, a hadn't gotten out of work yet. so i didn't even look at her 1 time the whole time i was there. so we're all talking &amp; shit. a comes home & sits down for like 10 minutes &amp; then says oh i need to go take a shower. so she does, comes back sits on the couch in her towel for like another 10 minutes & then asks julia so what's going on? and she says to her, my shit is in the car i have a full tank of gas so we're just waiting for you. to which a responds, oh i've had my stuff packed since this afternoon. you stupid bitch. when i talked to you this afternoon you told me that you were stuck in the middle &amp; that you didn't know what you should do & blah blah blah. oh but you were so confused about going or not going because i wasn't invited that you just packed your shit? whatever man. so on that note i got up, went to the bathroom went back in there grabbed my bag &amp; said ok guys i'll talk to you later & left. i didn't ask them when they were coming back or anything. fuck them. she's gonna be so damn jealous that she won't invite me to go the beach house? ugh whatever. i'm not gonna get aggravated this early in the morning. so after that i just went home &amp; went to bed.    yesterday i went food shopping with f & we cooked dinner &amp; prepared dinner for tonight. we ate rack of lamb yesterday & tonight it's spagetti &amp; meatballs. tomorrow eggplant parm. we never set things up like this but hey maybe it's a good thing that we do!   now let's see what happens today with the assholes.   i'm just happy that i have true friends that don't talk behind my back. and if i seriously have to spell it out cause y'all don't know chocolate kisses & white girl good lookin out.      well signing off for now kids.      hasta manana       ; )
