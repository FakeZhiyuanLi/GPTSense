      I woke up that morning with knots in my stomache the size of pineapples.  I really didn't want to go by this point, it was probably mostly nervousness and not knowing what to expect.  I hate walking into situations blind.  I got to the Airport around 5am.  Two other recruits from my unit were both there.  We said goodbye to our loved ones and left for the security checkpoints.  The plane rides were uneventful.  I'd never been on a plane before that.  Which was somewhat ironic. We arrived at San Antonio around 6pm.  Us and many other new recruits say anxiously waiting for the buses to take us to lackland.  I remember I kept thinking "I should go buy a ticket home and leave, yeah, yeah that's what I' should do."  Then a gentleman from Lackland told us *yelling* "Shut up and listen up"  *sigh*  We got on the busses for Lackland.  Holy Crap.  Let me just say that again, Holy Crap. When we arrived it was sur-fucking-real.  We were getting immediatly screamed at by all these genuinely frightening people in campaign hats.  Its funny because you know that's what going to happen, and you fully expect it, but its nothing like you thought it would be when it does.  Actually the "reception" wasn't the worst of it.  They brought us into a receiving area where we were made to stand at attention (which fortunatly thanks to student flight I already knew how to do, keeping "below the radar screen" at basic is very important to survival).  They told us to set our bags down.  Now there's a difference between "setting" your bag down, and "dropping" your bag.  And of course, there was always that one asshole who just kept on dropping his bag until the TI's zeroed in on him (MTI-Military Training Instructor).  They brought us into a classroom for initial inprocessing and paperwork.  After that they bussed us to the training squadrons to which we'd been assigned.  There were several different squadrons: 319th-Medical squadron, if you got injured during training you would go there and shine your boots for weeks and weeks until you could return to training, 320th, 321st, 322nd "candyland", 323rd, 324th "Disneyland", and *drum roll* 331st "Hell's Corner".  I wound up in the most difficult, strict, and feared training squadron in the whole of Lackland.  I'm lucky like that.  The Wolf Pack.  We were greeted by a very large and angry MTI by the name of Ssgt Rangel.  I'm still pretty sure he wasn't a real person.  I think they assembled him at the NCO (NCO- Non-Commisioned Officer) Academy out of the spare body parts of dead Airmen.  He had us all stand with our noses agains our wall lockers as he stormed around punching lockers to see if we'd flinch.  This was our home for the next seven weeks.  Super.  That night they had us shower, if you call getting water on part of your body in a matter of 3 seconds with 60 other guys in a 12 x 12 shower room a shower.  And they sat us in teh day room where we were told that more or less we were the scum that scum scrapes off its ass.  And we were told why we were there.  We weren't there to pay for college, we weren't there for a steady job or travel, we were there to "kill people and break their shit."

      My last day as a civilian was pretty weird.  It felt surreal, like I wasn't leaving the next day and not coming back for seven months.  I spent most of the day packing the last of my clothing and personal belongings into storage at my parents house.  Then I sat on the balcony chain smoking cigarettes and reading and re-reading all my paperwork.  I knew so little of what to expect when I arrived at basic, it was quite maddening.  That evening I went out for one last hurrah with some friends.  We went to Dennys.  I really like Dennys.  It was myself, joe, becca, jason, Rachel Z, Rachel St, and my g/f Zann.  That's a funny side note, when I enlisted I didn't have a g/f, no real strings or things to leave behind.  Then, about a month and a half before I was to leave I started dating Zann, who'd been a long time friend and something of a crush.  So naturally, I no longer wanted to go.  But you've gotta play the hand your dealt, I just happened to lose.  On a side side note, I found out later that up until you get on the plane you can still back out.  That would've been nice to know.  A generally good time was had by all, the waitress gave me my food for free because life was gonna suck for the next seven months.  I said my goodbyes and went home with her (zann not the waitress).  We spoke softly for a while then she left around midnight.  I remember I stood on my porch for a while just looking around and smelling the air, then I went to bed.  I felt anxious, nervous, angst ridden, regretful and afraid.  I'd never REALLY felt those emotions before.  It's not fun the first time.

      Ok, just one note, I'm not shooting for flawless writing here.  Expect grammar and spelling issues.  To those of you who want to nit pick, you knew what I meant even if it was mis spelt and full of grammatical errors.  July 16th 2002. I had spent the better part of six months getting ready to enlist.    I first had to put together a waiver packaged for my legal troubles as a youth.  I had been convicted of a misdemeanor count of theft, it was plea bargained down from accessory to armed robbery so I'd say I did pretty good.  I received one year probation.  Even though it was a mesdemeanor and I was under 18 and it was allegedly wiped from my record after I turned 18, for the military's intents and purposes it was still there.  So I had to get letters of recommendation from people and compose a letter detailing what my involvement had been (for the record it was a matter of wrong crowd, wrong place, wrong time).   Then in April of 2002 I had to go to the MEPS center to find out if I qualified physically to join.  I have a funky shoulder (pops in and out of socket, but only when I make it) so I had to get two medical waivers for that.  When enlistment day rolled around I was sworn in by Maj Kelly (I was going into the intelligence field and she was my CO).  I remember feeling little to no anxiousness about it.  I wasn't really nervous at all.  I just kind of went in, signed the papers to the oath and that was it.  In September I began going to drills.  They had a program called student flight, for recruits who hadn't been to basic yet.  It was run by Lt Plourde and Maj Jordan.  We'd have classroom instruction and tours of the base, basically just tips and tricks to help prepare us for basic.  Then in the afternoon we'd have PC (Physical Conditioning, which has now been replaced by PRT Physical Readiness Training).  On the sundays of drill weekends we'd go work in our respective shops.  However where my career was intel I couldn't work in my shop do to the sensitive nature of it, until I'd been through my training.  So I sort of became a grunt for the base.  I'd go where ever there was work to be done.  I spent the majority of the time working with the officers who ran student flight.  After a few months I was setting up the whole schedule, giving briefings to the recruits, arranging M16 cleanings at the Security Forces bulding.  It was fun because I was basically the same as everyone else in student flight but at the same time I had more authority...kinda.  I also did work in the recruiting office from time to time, mostly paper work and filing.  I did get to design an ad for the wing that ran in the paper, so that was pretty neat.  Otherwise that office was single handedly the most boring part of the whole thing.  Although in its defense it was fun when new people would come in and I'd occasionally get to help talk them into joining.  Oh, hehe also I once spent an afternoon coiling up christmas lights from a dance they held in the hanger.  Yeah, I was a finely tuned instrument of warfare.

      Howdy.  I've started this blog to document the entire sordid and facinating account of my time in the USAF.  Chances stand I'll only update it everytime 50% of the planets are in alignment and I get really really bored.  I'm going to try to keep my curiosity under wraps and keep it simple no pictures or fancy html tricks.  More or less this is just going to be a long rather dull story that'll hopefully keep a few people entertained, in this wide, boring realm known as the internet.

      I decided, that, it's probably not in my best interests to post a detailed account of what I did in the Air Force on the internet.  Becuase then, quite likely, I would be hunted down, kidknapped and have my fingernails removed...slowly.  So for a typed account of my long...long tale please drop me an e-mail and I'll send you a copy. Pietro54@hotmail.com
