       Rants and virile are not for me.  I'm done.  No more. Kaputski.  All gone.  From now on I'm going to post content based on what I'm doing and what I know. The internet is no place to work out my angst and misguided journalistic sentament, no matter how sincere or 4th form English in style.  There will be no more heated exchanges between either of my opinions.  Thankyou.

       Hey!  My profile says I was born in the year of the sheep...?  I'm offended!  Why didn't I know this before now?  Shouldn't this be on my drivers license or something?  Why isn't it something cool like a penguin or a dragon?  This really smarts.

       I've been thinking for a while that the internet lacks any substance so to add to the problem and thereby prove my point I've created a blog for myself.  This is my contribution to the HTML.asp.PHP collage of destruction we call the web.  Bill Gates said the internet was a passing fad and I agreed with him back then like I do right now.  My Blue-WAP 802.11m super-G enabled knifeset  I bought on  urlLink E-bay  is cutting edge but this  urlLink Google  enabled HTML stuff has a limited lifespan in my opinion.  Some good news is that I've decided to invest in a scheme I've had a tip off about. This scheme seems like a guaranteed  winner.  I feel this time I'm going to get lucky - not like all those other times.  I'll still make an effort to update this blog even after I cash in on my imminent  urlLink Nigerian  fortune.  Things I'll be posting include links to sites I find interesting.  Rants on politics, bogus-philosophy and numerous statements of “fact” that are weighted with opinion but not necessarily true and or relevant.  This is my electronic ejection seat for musings and the like.  It's also a darn convenient way to stay in touch with lots of folks with out clogging up your tidy inboxes.

       Last night I caught up with my friend Kellie!  An unexpected piece of good fortune.  Kelly is working at a nice restaurant in Brooklyn.  Wait staff get paid in tips only but it can be an excellent way to make a living depending on the clientele.  We watched Fahrenheit 9/11 in Times Square then caught the subway to Brooklyn where I had a home cooked dinner, drank too much beer and talked into the wee small hours.  Funny how comfy couches can be when you’re wasted.  Unfortunately this heat does not lend itself to sleep and the Kellies building swayed in a disconcerting fashion with each subway train as it passed in the night.    Brooklyn is grimier than the maintained cityscape of midtown Manhattan.  Glad I saw a real apartment though and savored the new surroundings.  – I’m feeling like I’ve seen a good portion of the city now but there is soo much I still haven’t seen - I’ll have to come back I think.  This afternoon I’m meeting Mims, Julia and James.  I’m getting a car organized and will do battle with a Laundromat!  Having an admin day and I hope time for a sleep.    Will post some more NY photos but my next update will be from the road I hope.  Not looking forward to negotiating NY streets in a rental car but if it doesn’t kill you then it must be good for you, or so they say.

       27th August. New York    To exist in New York one must have thick skin, millions of dollars or preferably both. This town is expensive and money certainly oils the wheels to make life more convenient if not simply accessible. Quality of life without a stack of money appears to be a tough existence eeked out by making life easier for folks higher up the salary food chain. The entrepreneurial spirit is incredible.  Homelessness exists although not to the scale I was expecting. I haven’t seen Harlem yet and have stayed close to central Mid-town with a few ventures to the financial district in downtown.    The sheer size of this place is staggering. I’m resigned to the fact that I’m only going to see 0.1% of what I should. I’m making an effort to get about when I can but the humidity is oppressive. Tomorrow is museum day where I’ll get to the Metro and the Guggenheim. Thursday I’ll try to get to the Intrepid and see a bit of Greenwich village.    Learning to use the subway was no small achievement – bar the incident where I ended up in Brooklyn by accident! One must be care not to catch a train in the wrong direction.    Central Park is an amazing oasis in the craziness. New Yorkers are fiercely proud of the park and it’s beautifully maintained. The park is an enormous collection of lakes, mini forests and walkways. It even has a mini-zoo. The park is in constant use by walkers, joggers, cruising gays and those infernal cyclists who deem it necessary to wear full road kit to blast around the park during their lunch breaks.    Such apparent wealth is stunning to see – it’s readily on display. There are enormous stretched limos, private helicopters ferrying corporate folk about and the odd car truck with it’s delivery of latest model Lamborghinis. Every skyscraper, especially the older ones have a unique charm and add to the flavor of their district. My personal favorite is the Chrysler building lit by night – it’s beautiful. My favorite modern structure would be the twin glass towers of the Time Warner complex. I’ll need to get down to see Grand Central at some stage.    This place really does never sleep. Times Square draws people in simply because it’s ever constant, frenetic pulse. The building sized electronic billboards turn night into day allowing a constant flood of humanity through the congested streets means.  You’ve got to be constantly aware of where you’re heading and whats going on although I’ve never felt unsafe.  The games of three card monty, imitation Gucci sales stands and portable food vendors (yum pretzels) add to the sights, sounds smells. At one point there were several three card monty games happening on the street where I was near Times Square. A cry went up and within seconds the games, the gamers and their paraphernalia had disappeared into the crowd. Police wandered down the street seconds later none the wiser. I’d seen nothing like it.    The NYPD are a friendly bunch and they’re everywhere. It’s certainly a well policed town. The federal buildings are covered in guards. The NYSE had it’s own battalion of SWAT teams, dogs and regular police milling about. People are expecting specific sites to come under another attack at any time - whether the policing is going to help them, I really doubt it but the blue suited troopers make good direction givers to lost tourists.    Locals are looking at $1000 a month for a tiny studio to live anywhere in Manhattan. It’s no surprise people choose to live in the outlying districts. Brooklyn, The Bronx etc are all within striking distance via the bus and subway routes and friendly locals tell me you get a lot more accommodation for you money in the boroughs.    Several things strike me about this town. The first thing is the ethnic diversity. Walk down the street and see blacks, Asians, Europeans and all manner of accents charging about. My favorite dialect is the thick New York drawl. I have enjoyed great conversations with the Hotel barmen who love to chat about their town and their experiences.    There is so much I have to not say for lack of time. I’ll post a few of my favorite pictures taken thus far. Will try to add another update about NY before I leave.

       23rd August – Arrival and my first day in San Francisco:    A slightly outdated update – it’s now day three in the USA and I’m in NY!  More updates to follow once I stop long enough to write up my NY adventures…    ---    A painful flight after a week of subdued nervosa-anxiety resulted in Simon arriving at San Francisco tired but present in body if not mind or lacking his usual sweet temperament.    My short flight to Auckland was marred by the knowledge that I had left my cell phone charger in my bedroom – I was annoyed with myself to say the least.  Oh well, something else to track down in New York (since done!)    I nearly left my digital camera at an Auckland McDonalds after a tea break but an ever weary Nathan and Greg spotted it in their car - good work chaps!  I think they’re now used to me leaving stuff behind.  Maybe I’ll grow out of that habit.    The flight to San Francisco was long.  Very long.  There is nothing like wanting to be somewhere to make the getting there drag out over an eternity.    I was in a middle seat of the left hand isle in cattle class meaning that the 55 year old yoga teacher who has 3 sons, one of which is completing a Ph.D and is looking at moving somewhere so both he and his girlfriend can see each other more, had to climb over me every time she needed to run through some self empowering pilates routine, or take a toilet break.  It didn’t help that this lady had prostate issues (you figure it out?).  She had this neat trick though where she would leap, poised and graceful like from arm rest to arm rest into the aisle and back again.  This lady was the Cat Woman crossed with Yoda.    The other middle aged woman on my right had no issues with sleeping.  In fact she was so comfortable sleeping that she performed a ‘tower of piza’ routine onto my middle 1/3 of the bench every 15 minutes.  This was irritating.    To add to the surrealism of the trip I downed a rather potent little sleeping pill which made me incredibly drowsy and somewhat doped up for a few hours.  How the sweet escape of sleep taunted me as it came tantalizingly close, only to be chased off by the previously mentioned space invading passenger slumping onto my counter balancing shoulder.  This caused my body to pivot on the opposing butt cheek.  The outcome of this whole cyclic ordeal was that I didn’t sleep a whole lot and remained in a spacey and somewhat irritable condition.  I gave each butt cheek a fair turn at being my body cushion before I finally declared defeat and watched an in flight movie.  At the conclusion of play my iPod was declared most valuable player along with the egg based breakfast option I chose about 2 hours prior to landing.    Watching the San Francisco hills protrude from fog was exciting.  Seeing America loom through the clouds for the first time gave my somewhat addled nerves a second wind.  I’ve had 3rd, 4th and 5th winds since seeing as it’s now 10:45pm Pacific time and I haven’t slept in two and a half days!  I managed to get through customs in good time although nearly got into trouble with a man with a very big gun for taking a photo inside the customs area.  Apparently this was a threat to national security.  Funny how compliant one will become when faced with a sidearm bearing homeland security full metal jacket type.    Robyn and Steve’s friend, the lovely Gratia (pronounced Gray-shia), met me at the metallic and futuristic looking SFO airport.  We trundled my gear around and onto the BART (Bar Area Rapid Transport).  BART whisked us underground north through and under the greater Bay area.  We traveled through the city, Berkley, Oakland and eventually arrived in Layfette where Robyn and Steve live.    Lafayette is a sleepy SUV laden city fully furnished with parks and trees.  It feels like a small town built in a sparse forest with all the trees and hills sprouting out from the manicured lawns.  Gratia was the ultimate host.  She fed and watered me and we went for a fascinating drive around the local area.  We stopped at a cute super market and discussed the properties of Root beer with the locals.  American super markets are something to behold.  Talk about choice.  We bought a tub of vanilla ice cream to have with our root beer floaters – the American equivalent of a spider made with root beer.  Then we sat in the shade at Robyn and Steve’s leafy abode and watched squirrels, robins and the cat all frolic together.  The cat got a bird and I felt compelled to intervene and rescue it.  That was a drama in itself.  I’ve only been here one day and already I deserve a complementary Sierra Club membership.  Robyn came home from work, Steve was in San-Diego for the weekend so haven’t met him yet.  We had Italian for dinner before I finally collapsed into bed.  I have a 6 hr flight to NY tomorrow which should be fun.    ---    Observations:    Every second house having a US flag on the porch.  It’s kinda cool that people are proud of where they live and think  bout what it means to belong to a bigger community.    Americans like really big cars.  The kind they open new iron ore factories to build and generally have massive 4.5 – 5 litre engines.  They are everywhere.    Soccer moms.  Gratia explained that these are the types who have big glasses, permanently attached cell phones and ferry little Timmy to and from soccer practice in their goliath sized cars.  Maybe they are expecting to traverse a river or gorge along the way?  Ahh – the illusion of safety.    The people are really friendly.  The laid back approach of the Californian’s is apparent.  The wonderful hospitality of Robyn and Gratia was much appreciated.  Thanks heaps guys!    Finally - seeing a squirrel!  They have puffy tails.  Tee Hee.    ---    [end]
