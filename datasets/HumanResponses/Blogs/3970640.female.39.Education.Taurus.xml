      I'm feeling not so paranoid today!&nbsp;&nbsp; That wasn't the case earlier, but as the night wears on, I've been feeling better and more relaxed.&nbsp; Perhaps it's the realization that I leave tomorrow for&nbsp; a mini vacation at a cabin up north.  My mind works in weird yet wonderous ways... I got to thinking and I got to thinking after typing that last sentence, &nbsp;what is "up north"?&nbsp; For someone in Florida heading up north for a vacation that could be just about anywhere.&nbsp; What about someone in Canada?&nbsp; How far up north could you go?  To me, up north is almost akin to a utopia - a place where everyone exisit in peace in seemingly perfect conditions.&nbsp; It's the ideal vacation spot where you will find relaxation and contentment.&nbsp; When things are troubling you, head "up north". &nbsp;Though so perfect in all it's makeup, up north also&nbsp;seems almost&nbsp;unreachable and unattainable&nbsp;as well - like a carrot dangled before your eyes.&nbsp; Up north is El Dorado - it's the Fountain of Youth.&nbsp;   Well, regardless of what it is, my daughter and I are heading there this weekend - at least we are going to attempt to find it!&nbsp; Sitting at our campfire with a trillion stars glistening overhead, no phones or computers in sight, I think we'll come darn close.

      I'm paranoid. I was thinking about this today at work when I sat at my desk wondering if everyone was talking about me; then wondering why I cared if they did or not?!   It all started on Monday when a good friend and co-worker announced that she'd quit. She had been off work on medical leave for quite some time, and when she came back, there were a few people out to get her (they really were - she wasn't being paranoid!). Well, she comes from an extremely wealthy family, so instead of fighting, just quit (she's been there for over 10 years). I'm happy for her really - she can spend time with her family and doesn't have to worry about the cattiness at the library. What threw me for a loop though&nbsp;was all the talk that was going on behind her back. The people cheering that she was going to leave. The other co-workers rushing to get their resumes together so they could apply for her job.   People do talk about other people… people do gossip, I know that. It goes on all the time in our staff lounge or in the elevator or by the loading dock… But I never really thought about people talking about me until I saw this explosion of "hey, did you hear…" going on this week. It made me really start to wonder.   So as I sat at my desk this afternoon after a meeting, that didn't go so well - I started to speculate what others could be saying about me behind my back. As I was stewing, I decided to hop on the net and look up  paranoia  (At times I sure damn the people who put the internet together!). I found this article on the internet which said:    "Almost everyone experiences feelings of paranoia at some time in their lives. Paranoia is a perception that people are talking about you and spying on you, that they can't be trusted and do not have your best interest at heart. Paranoid people feel helpless and fear entrapment. They tend to be touchy, slow to forgive and quick to take offence. They feel victimized by what they perceive to be the overly critical attitudes and unjust anger of others. At the same time they are very self-conscious and critical of themselves. In an effort to defend against their own fears, they project a great deal of hostility and sarcasm toward significant others. "    Oh my God, that's ME!   I announced this revelation to my husband…his reply?&nbsp; "Yeah, I know. But you're functional."&nbsp; Ok, is this a real helpful response?! It gave me the ache-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach sort of feeling… He went on to clarify "But honey, you're getting better." All I want to do is find some hole to crawl into. If he knew, is this something that everyone knows? Can they tell I don't have it all held together? Why the hell am I worrying?!?! God, I am paranoid!   I suppose revelation is a step towards  cure , if cure is the right term. Maybe&nbsp; understanding  would be better. Perhaps I don't really need to be fixed or cured at all :)&nbsp; Just realizing what I do, and why I'm doing it, will help me to be more aware of my actions. Growth - it's something that never stops, eh?&nbsp;&nbsp; But I can do that in the moring... right now&nbsp;I'm going to go find that hole...

      I'm a librarian, as you've probably guessed by my username.&nbsp; We are in the throws of the Summer Reading Program&nbsp;during which&nbsp;each week various performers visit the library.&nbsp; Some put on puppet shows, others do storytelling, and then there are the magicians.&nbsp; Magicians are by far draw the biggest crowds.&nbsp; Everyone is mesmerized by them - who isn't fascinated with magicians?!&nbsp;   Well, my husband has today off so decided to spend the day with our daughter and take her to the magic show later this afternoon (instead of having her go to the summer program&nbsp;preschool, like normal).&nbsp; Last night he asked her if she wanted a daddy day... "No!" she said, "I want to go to school".&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking to myself "cool, she finally likes going to school"... that isn't what my husband thought!&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew it was silly, but he was hurt she'd rather go to school than spend the day with him.... she's almost 5, starting to grow up and show her independence - are we ready?!  This morning my husband thought he'd try one more time.&nbsp; He asked her yet again if she'd like to have a daddy day and go see the magician later on.&nbsp; She looks up at him and says "No I wanna go to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey!&nbsp; I've got an idea!&nbsp; You go and tape the show.&nbsp; I'll watch the video tonight."  I had to chuckle... it is good though, I think.&nbsp; She actually WANTS to go to school - I like that.&nbsp; Knowing she can catch the show later on video is a bit disturbing, but part of the culture I suppose.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband at least sees the irony - he's trying to get her to not go to school for a day and she's saying no, that's where she wants to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the least of our problems, we'll be lucky.

      Well, I just bought $150 worth of beef.&nbsp; What in the heck was I thinking?!&nbsp; This guy knocks on my door at 7pm - my daughter and I had just gotten home from work/pre-school - he has a case of meat he needs to get rid of.&nbsp; It was such an odd story, I had to believe it.... he'd been delivering in the neighborhood and had an extra case.&nbsp; Instead of losing it, he'd try to get rid of it to someone else.&nbsp; I guess I was the only one who answered the door!   The guy was from  urlLink Mega Foods .&nbsp; I hadn't heard of them before, but what the heck - he opened the whole box, got out all the different meats - they were all&nbsp; vaccuumed sealed.....&nbsp; And I was hungry (never shop when you're hungry).&nbsp; Well, I bought the box for 1/2 off the regular price.&nbsp; Am I nuts, or what?!?   The thing is, I can't even cook steak!&nbsp; At least not to my husband's liking... he likes the cow to still moo, where I'd rather know everything is completely killed.&nbsp; So, according to him, I can't cook 'em... they're too well done or too tough or whatever.&nbsp; Oh my gosh, that reminds me of my chicken!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn't like my chicken either... in fact, we had been married&nbsp;about a year - his sister was coming over for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a wonderful chicken dish that was one of&nbsp;my husband's&nbsp;favorites, but instead of using thigh meat like normal, I&nbsp;used chicken breast (considering his reaction to the change, I'm sure there's a joke there somewhere).&nbsp;&nbsp; He took a bite, drank some water, and said "This is  awful .&nbsp; I can't even  gag  it down".&nbsp;&nbsp;   Guys and gals, one thing you do NOT say to your significant other when they've worked hard to make you a nice meal,  especially  when you have company, &nbsp;is "I can't even gag it down".&nbsp; Trust me, just about anything would be better.&nbsp; We didn't have that dish for another 2&nbsp; years and you better believe he gagged it down.   So,&nbsp;considering my luck with chicken, am I game to try cooking up beef for the next year?!&nbsp; Fillet mignon?!&nbsp; NY Strip?!?&nbsp; Sirloin?!?&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; I guess I'll get a lot of practice... and practice makes perfect, right? (why did I just flash to the Stepford Wives???).&nbsp;   If my husband doesn't like it, well, I suppose I could always just&nbsp;try the Atkins diet.&nbsp;

      I never believed in Cupid. After a few relationships over the years, I really thought that if there really was a cupid and he was trying to hit me with is arrow, he was a dang poor marksman. Perhaps he needs glasses? His bow restrung? New arrows? I didn't know what the problem was, but I decided to put love on the backburner of my stove-of-life and start focusing on getting out into the open air and broadening my horizons; an idea which had been on simmer way too long.   Fortunately for me, I was living in rural Oklahoma at the time; a very nice country town which definitely provided a vast array of experiences to explore: rodeos, water falls, hiking paths, open roads, cowboys. Unfortunately for my outdoor adventures, the Internet soon made it to small town America.   I'm not one to make friends quickly or easily. I much prefer to nurture a few good friendships overtime and grow with the relationship. Basically, I'm shy, yet picky. For these very reasons, even after living in Oklahoma for almost a year, I had made no friends to speak of. Not even those which I could meet for a drink after work, or go shopping with. And to be quite honest, I was lonely for companionship. Someone to do things with and share experiences with. Because of this, I bought myself a computer and hopped right onto the information super highway.   Meeting my future husband did not top my list of things I wanted to achieve on the net. I really had no expectations at all. I simply wanted to get on line and explore (good-bye fresh air!). Soon, I was emailing, surfing, and chatting with the best of them. And quite to my surprise, a friend who I had met online (let's call him cupid), introduced me to the man who would soon virtually sweep my feet right out from under me and totally turn my world upside down (people do refer to Australia as "downunder" you know). My cyber cupid's aim was straight and true.   Thankfully in the world of cyberspace, a bow never needs to be restrung, arrows can appear in a flash, and your vision is as clear as you've configured your monitor.

      I can't write tonight... have a song going through my head and it's the only thing I can think about.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishing my man would get off his computer:..     Throw your arms around me     by Hunters and Collectors    (though I like Paul McDermott's and Eddie Vedder's versions)    I will come for you at night time  And I will raise you from your sleep  I will kiss you in four places  As I go running up your street  And I will squeeze the life out of you  And you will make me laugh and make me cry  And we may never forget it  You will make me call your name  And I'll shout it to the blue summer sky   And we may never meet again  So shed your skin and lets get started  And you may throw your arms around me  Yeah you may throw your around me   Well I came for you at night time  And I watched you in your sleep  Lord I met you in high places  I kissed your head and kissed your feet  Now if you disappear out of view  You know that I will never say goodbye  And though I try and forget it  You will make me call your name  And I'll shout it to the blue summer sky   And we may never meet again  So shed your skin and lets get started  And you may throw your arms around me  Well I came for you at night time  And I watched you in your sleep  Lord I kissed you in four places  I kissed your head and kissed your feet  Throw your arms around me  Yeah you may throw your arms around me

      Garth Brooks once sang "sometimes I thank God, for unanswered prayers"… at times I wonder why anyone would think that way.  There have been instances when I believed this fully. Sometimes it is best to not get what we pray for. Everything happens for a reason. We don't know the  master plan . And then there are times when I feel like screaming "I don't give a d*mn about the reason! Make it work out NOW!"&nbsp; I've definitely&nbsp;had a lot of those times in my life...  What I've discovered is that no matter how much I want something to work out, if it is not meant to be, it just plain won't happen. Is that a good thing? I honestly don't know any more. It may be part of a master plan, but it certainly isn't always fair.

      Not long after I moved to Australia, a local news program featured a segment concerning a woman in a small town who was forced by the city to erect a fence around her property. Neighbors had complained about the unsightly condition of her yard. Negative words were tossed back and forth. Feelings were hurt. To add insult to injury, this woman not only had no choice as to the fence's appearance, but also had to pay for it!   Ok, perhaps some yards could really do with a fence to hide the stockpile of garbage collected over the years, but truly, I've never seen more fences surrounding houses for seemingly no apparent reason, than what line the streets of suburban Brisbane.   Some enclosures are quite remarkable as to their ornamentation, and others, not much more than the white washed picket fences of days gone by. Regardless of their appearance, why on earth do so many Brisbanites choose to hide behind these barriers anyway? Are the owners embarrassed to show the world their undie and bra laden Hill's Hoists or Uncle John's rusted out ute? Or is there another darker reason? One that has passed beyond the realm of premeditated acts and lapsed into the subconscious? Are Brisbanites afraid of their neighbors?   Let's face it, this country was after all founded by a rather huge lot of casted out convicts. And though ancestors of the original settlers would like you to think otherwise, not all prisoners exiled to this region were so because they simply stole a loaf of bread to feed their family (just ask my husband - that's what he thinks!)! I would hazard a guess that most original settlers, convicts, military, and civilians alike, were somewhat afraid. Here they were in the middle of no where, thousands of miles from family and friends, finding themselves neighbors with thugs, burglars, murderers and thieves. Is it really so hard to believe that possibly this fear and isolation has over time become so ingrained into the subconscious of Australians as to actually effect their lifestyle ? Could the rows and rows of fences simply be a silent scream to all who will take noticed - "We need to feel safe and protected!"   Perhaps not. It is just as likely that the owners only wish to display their wealth and afford their family and land with some protection from the elements, as well as the occasional hooligan. I would like them to take note though - a 6 foot high, solid cement fence does not instill in others a warm and fuzzy feeling, no matter how beautiful. My recommendation? (For what it's worth) tear down the fences, say G'day to passerby's, and head down to the local bakery, buy a loaf of bread and share it with your neighbor.

      If you are an American visiting Australia, you will undoubtedly be asked one somewhat simple question: "Are you from Canada?"   The first few times this happens, you smile politely and say "No sorry, I'm from Ohio", or whatever the case may be. This part of the verbal exchange is fine, really. It is what comes next that now (after 5 years in the country!) starts my blood boiling.&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind hearted Australian who inquired as to your nationality will then qualify their question with a statement such as "Oh, I thought perhaps you were American, but I just can't take a chance. If you ask a Canadian if they are American, boy do they get mad!".   Ok, the first few times I heard this explanation I smiled, laughed, and in general brushed it off. It was only after hearing it ALL the time, from various sorts of people, that it really began to grate on me. I mean really, do you think Americans love to hear how Canadians can't stand to be associated with us? Do you truly believe we need to know how insulted people from our neighboring country would be to be mistaken for "a Yank"?   Honestly, I love Canada. Having lived the majority of my life near the Canadian border, I visited the country often and have several dear friends there. I have asked those friends just what they thought of the whole predicament, and yes indeed, they really would be insulted if someone incorrectly thought they were from the US. Alright, I can accept that - country pride, and all.   But can't anyone in this vast world of ours see how it could be somewhat insulting to be told over and over again that a fellow human being would be utterly offended if they were mistaken as a person from your country?!?!   I just can't wait to ask the next Australian I meet if they are from New Zealand.

      For five years I lived in Brisbane, Australia.&nbsp; It was quite an experience.&nbsp; First off, I'd recommend a visit to the land down under to anyone who can handle flying for hours on end&nbsp;and&nbsp;who has&nbsp;a few thousand dollars to spend.&nbsp; The people are fantastic, the land is breathtaking, they don't care if you don't speak "English", &nbsp;and though I was unable to taste any culinary masterpieces, the food was at least identifiable and quite tasty.&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that I really appreciated was that I was actually exposed to different music, books, and ideas.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll get into all of those areas on here sooner or later, but the one I want to focus on now is  music .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sure, we have music in America - all kinds - but have you ever noticed how the singers and bands start to all look and sound the same after a while?&nbsp; It's rare to find something unique and yet still pleasant to the ears&nbsp; (feel free to make suggestions!).&nbsp; While in Australia I was exposed to a lot of muscians from the UK, Europe, as well as from Oz.&nbsp; One particular artist really caught my eye - and my ears as well.&nbsp; That was&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Robbie Williams  .&nbsp; Robbie was in the UK boy band Take That, but has made a name for himself as a solo artist selling out concerts around the globe... except in the United States. &nbsp; The first CD I bought in Australia was  Sing when you're winning .&nbsp; What captured me was that here was this rather cute (in a roguish sort of way) talented singer who could actually poke fun at himself as well as his icon status.&nbsp; If you haven't a clue what I'm saying, really take a look at the  Rock DJ  video sometime - he's got it available on his site. &nbsp; I can't comprehend why he hasn't made a name for himself in the US, unless he simply doesn't want to.&nbsp; He probably enjoys his anonymity here - can't blame him for that.&nbsp; But I do believe Americans are somewhat deprived not hearing his incredibly strong, soulful, versitile voice&nbsp; except on soundtrack records :) &nbsp; Give him a listen - you might be surprised and actually become a fan too.

      My co-workers and I were talking today about what games we used to play when we were younger (talking about the 70’s here).  One thing that we all had in common is that we had apple fights.   Fall would be approaching – the apples getting ripe.  You’d start early to gather apples for your stash.  That was part of the fun – finding a place to hide your apples!  It had to be a good hiding spot where no one else could find them, but you also had to be able to remember yourself where they were AND get to them easily as soon as a fight broke out!  At first we’d just throw the apples at each other – the more rotten they were, the better splat could be achieved.  But then someone got the braining idea to stab the apple onto the end of a stick and fling it at your enemy.  This worked great… but we got even more inventive!  Remember those long, orange, safety flags for bikes?  The poles were made out of a fiberglass sort of material.  If you rubbed the end just right on the sidewalk, you could make quite the spear.  And being fiberglass, they were more flexible than a stick, and boy could you get some fling action going!   I miss the days of the apple fights… sure there were tears, and yelling, and the occasional “I’m telling mom”, but by evening we usually all made up and were out with our flashlights for a rousing game of Flashlight Tag.   My daughter doesn’t play outside as much as I did when I was a kid…  of course, things don’t seem as safe now as they did back then.  We ran freely around the neighborhood, playing in the creek, sledding down the hills, jumping rope in the park,  biking around the town…  Wish somehow we could find that sort of freedom again.

      When I was young I worked at our small town library.  Not much exciting happened there, but we did have this one patron who would sign his name and in one fluid motion draw a little hand holding a pencil at the very end of his signature.  All of us girly pages would squeal with delight when he entered the building and we’d all vie for the chance to check him out (his books!!) because then we could be close at hand when he wrote his famous (to us) signature.  It didn’t hurt that the man was good looking, but we really were interested in his signature too.  People don’t much care about their signature now a day.  You don’t have to sign for you books at check out – it’s all computerized.  I suppose celebrities practice their signatures, but that would be about it.  We’re in the computer age and your signature is a cute ditty at the end of your email.

      Had a fantastic time away "up north". Didn't want to return, but alas I did have to go into work if I'm going to be able to afford more trips away in the future.  After all this relaxation, it was a real shocker to come home to a computer infected with Spyware. Tell me, who in the heck thinks up this crap?!?! There is one program on my computer that I did find a removal program for, however you actually have to buy it! I bet the same person/company made up the evil spyware and the fix. *sigh*  I have tried  urlLink Spybot S&amp;D  and  urlLink WebSweeper  with no luck. In my search for a "cure" however I have discovered quite a number of people in the same boat... I don't feel so alone :) Heck, check out  urlLink Keith Deven's  weblog! He's got a whole section devoted to spyware!
