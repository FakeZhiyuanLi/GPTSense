      i'm confused.. at times i really wonder.. is it the way my mind switches.. or the people around me? maybe all of us.. haha.. it's hard to control.. but meanwhile.. it's still our choice.. afterall.. the life is ours.. we decide wad we want to do with it rite?..   today's truly amazing.. i found myself waking up 5 mins before my alarm.. 'wad great timing'.. i tot to myself.. but it seems to be happening for the past few days.. however, today's a little different.. i didnt feel a bit tired.. i felt full of life and energetic.. but lazy bones are like the spots on a leapord's skin..  dragging my legs to the toilet.. hmmm.. i felt really great today.. besides the time that i had to ask ppl to shut up.. i hate throwing my tantrum.. well.. it's truly hard to control.. but yah, its our choice.. there'll be times when i feel really guilty doing something becos someone did something to mi which i didnt like so i double the pain back which shldnt be the case cos always treat others how u wld like to be treated and place urself in someone elses' shoes.. well.. thats the way to be considerate.. i dun like to strain any friendships cos i feel that everyone of our frens are basically "god's gift".. why i had to put those inverted commas?.. cos i dun believe in god?.. yah.. and so.. now here i amat home.. writing a bloggy.. hoping i'll suddenly get motivated to study and wishing for a freaking miracle to pass mi by that there will be no oral this sat cos it seems like my nervous system will soon break down and get mi the stomach aches.. yah..  hahahx.. well.. come quickly.. go quickly ba.. last year here anywayzx.. i mean.. hopefully.. so.. mus really whack my way thru.. otherwise.. i confirm i sure regret which infact i already am cos i'm basically wasting my precious time here typing a blog for the fun of it?.. or maybe for pleasure?.. lolzx.. wad ever it is.. today's been really great.. always wishing tomolo's beta.. -peace out-

      This morning's weird.. I wake up to find myself not energised at all.. Life's tough.. O Levels' coming and i'm rushing.. sometimes.. we feel like giving up.. but we'll come to realise that that would be a stupid choice.. however.. it seems to me like i've been thinking that way all these while.. Each time i feel really drained, i'll feel like giving up.. but i know that i should get it done and over with.. afterall.. the world is round.. by giving up, i'm jus leaving the problem/s there and one day.. it'll come back again.. I don't wan to waste such time.. Well.. i guess i'll just finish this year nicely and quickly.. hopefully, i won't come back again.. haha.. It's hard sometimes when u know that everyone in the world is ur competitor.. frm the day i entered this world.. i've started competing with everyone else.. esp when you enter schools and the world market.. you compete with knowledge.. for money, for post.. for almost everything in the world.. I really wish i belonged to the cavemen times.. what would we need to compete for, besides food and water and maybe a wife?.. haha.. ok.. so.. we're still competing.. well.. i'm still figuring the meaning of my life.. it's complicating.. and at times.. really pathetic.. I don't even know what i want to be when i grow up.. i'm ambitionless.. i'm talentless and plain empty.. I'm really worried.. my studies suck.. and it seems like 'so will my future'..

(it happens).. then get his morning and evening walks.. eat great food.. wad more cld a dog like him ask for?.. haahahzx.. it certainly looks like he need a companion.. u know wad i mean.. so.. gtg..

      let mi see.. today was pretty gd.. though still a little upset over my pathetic results, leading to me going bonkers today. Anyways.. i think i was most bonkers suring my sss with Aliah.. lolzx.. dun really know his name but he's actually this sec 5 guy hu is a little bit on the cc type yah know?.. fat, so to speak.. Aliah and i were bored and we forced out our imagination and tot he was pretty cute.. we obeserved his every move and laugh each time we noticed something and acted it out.. lolzx.. it was truly amusing.. it was probably the most enjoyable sss i ever had.. so cool.. we said he was hot and cute and adorable and sweet, and all the gd stuff.. lolzx..  aliah noticed his chest and butt.. lolzx.. yah.. and we were laughin at that too.. really.. it was funny.. and totally lame.. cos obviously we were being really insane and crappy and all but certain things are hard to control rite?.. lolzx.. then when sss ended.. it started to rain and all.. did part of my colour scheme.. that sri didnt come today so we cont our art from where we stopped.. and wad i realised was that everyone was pretty much serious about completing their art.. including those hu usually sleeps or do their own work when she aint arnd.. except for bs.. he's still not being very serious.. lolzx..   hmmmm.. i sincerely hope i can fight thru this battle field and still stay alive and strong.. not easy though of cos.. aiming for visual comm.. i know i said this b4.. just repeating it.. hais.. cant seem to concentrate on my work.. i mus do it!!.. mi go bathe le.. then do my art.. jia you!!!!
