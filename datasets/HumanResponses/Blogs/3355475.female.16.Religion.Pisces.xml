      The more things change, the more they stay the same. I'm not sure who the first person was who said that. Probably Shakespeare. Or maybe Sting. But at the moment, it's the sentence that best explains my tragic flaw: my inability to change.   I don't think I'm alone in this. The more I get to know other people, the more I realize it's kind of everyone's flaw. Staying exactly the same for as long as possible, standing perfectly still... It feels safer somehow. And if you are suffering, at least the pain is familiar. Because if you took that leap of faith, went outside the box, did something unexpected... Who knows what other pain might be out there, waiting for you. Chances are it could be even worse.   So you maintain the status quo. Choose the road already traveled and it doesn't seem that bad. Not as far as flaws go. You're not a drug addict. You're not killing anyone... Except maybe yourself a little.   When we finally do change, I don't think it happens like an earthquake or an explosion, where all of a sudden we're like this different person. I think it's smaller than that. The kind of thing most people wouldn't even notice unless they looked at us really close. Which, thank God, they never do.   But you notice it. Inside you that change feels like a world of difference. And you hope this is it. This is the person you get to be forever... that you'll never have to change again.

      today started out well, but then it turned and became crappy  There is this thing someone told me once... if you have shit going on in your life, and you feel really crappy, don't get mad at someone else. because that just makes there day crappy, and it will make them get angry at someone else... a horrible chain reaction that causes much more bad than good. do something positive with that anger, or whatever is bothering you. get some money and buy a punching bag or some shit. then hit it when you feel crappy.  so, next time you have a crappy day... remember, hit something to make it go away... no seriously... it works

      tonight was quite an interesting night... i went to go see TROY, i recomend seeing it, but it isn't one of my all time favorites. although hot guys and gals go galavanting around in bare breasts and chests, the movie moves slowly in some/most parts but there is(are) good fight scene(s).

      Hello, my name is John and i am 29 years old from chicago. I'm 6 ft (my doctor told me), brown eyes, black hair, muscular, hot... you think of the rest... *wink*. I enjoy long walks on the beach, watching sunsets, having picknicks. Parents love me, because i am the typical all-american (originally from SK(GO REDS!!!!!(soccer))). I am the romantic type who knows how to have a good time and knows when to be funny. I'm really desperate at the moment and i'm looking foward to meeting new people through this Internet service. Over the 29 years of my life I have remained selabate (not by choice). I will take almost anything. I have also remained true to my first love, my right hand. Please, if you are any interested in me, please give me a call on my cell phone, (312) 255-0999 or e-mail me @ ismellfunny56@yahoo.com, and i do not smelly funny, FYI.  I'm sorry, but i have a lot of time to kill at the present moment. I am also sorry for those people who do "enrole" on these online dating services. Why would you really need to meet someone online. the whole purpose of a meaningful relationship is the impression you make on the partner. None of this blind-date online crap. The only reason people do this stuff is because they can't get somebody in real-life, so they try to get someone online. Next thing you know, you try talking to the person on the phone and "she" has the voice of a 57 year-old male who kinds sounds a lot like your uncle Pedro O'Horney.

      i am at my friends house right now while they are playing a game called BILLY HATCHER. this game is so fucking stupid and sick. you play as this little kid who dresses up in a chicken costume who is on a mission, a mission to destroy little animals. you go around finding little eggs that can possibly hatch into other animals that can help you throughout your journey of destruction. while you are on this journey of the destruction of little animals, you run around ot the tunes of cheerful happy-time music that brainwashes you to actually enjoy playing this game. i feel sorry for all of those people who actually buy this game and enjoy the music and all this game has to offer. i pitty you.... this excludes david reed...

      Last night i went to go see that movie, SUPERSIZE ME. what a great movie!!! brilliant!!! i recommend it to everyone. all though there are a few gross scenes in the movie, it is well worth it. it is informative and hilarious and makes you think everytime you visit a fast-food joint. I went into the movie having low experctations but i enjoyed myself and had a fun time. Morgan Spurlock is a genius. There are also pieces of propoganda art done by the genius artist Ron English that are shown through out the movie that are amazing. this is honestly a must see movie. i think i enjoyed it more because i got to watch this guy eat 3 meals a day for 30 days from mcdonalds. it is crazy to see everything this guy goes through.... GO SEE IT
