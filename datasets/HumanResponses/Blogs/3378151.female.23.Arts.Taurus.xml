      its about to go down...  so in my never ending quest for the answers i have come to sum conclusions today...  1. i need to take time for myself.  this may sound like the most basic thing to normal folk but for a gurl like me, i dont give myself me days. the good thing about when me & jah were dating was i really took 24hours off every week. a person needs that.   2. i am scared of commitment, lifetime monogamy. miguel knows it. i know it. sumtimes i feel like we dont have the crazy "im so in luv with u fever" we are comfortably in love. playfully in luv. i dont get all crazy i cant take my eyes off of him... i dont know if u need this & the not knowing scares me, however, im down to take it day by day...  3. im scared shitless of most shit. im scared ppl dont like me. im scared i sound stupid when i talk, that im talking too much not making any sense. im scared of social situations. i dont know where to put my body, my hands, my eyes. i thought i had outgrown this but it seems like i really havent.   4. the government is crazy. & whats even crazier is that government could be reading this right now (could be, they are!) i put my innermost thoughts on the internet for the governemnt to see? thats strange. but sumhow typing on this here blogger has always been a little easier for me than the real microsoft thing. maybe i hate microsoft. bill gates is the devil.   its a trip that ppl actually believe in the devil... i cant believe my miles kind of blue is skipping. all my CDs skip. im not careful with things. shit, im really freaking hungry. the last thing i ate was that great salad at urth cafe...   by the time im 33 i wanna be christ i wanna walk over water & turn it into wine i wanna raise children from the dead & heal ppl from leprosy  heal children from HIV lead a caravan of bad ass ladees & a few good men. jesus was cool man...   i luv to fall in luv. with friends. with men. with music. with situations & buildings & poems. i love to fall in love with moments. to smell the black soap in her hair or the heavy sweat under his arm. i luv dirty shit. filthy ppl with filthy mouths & open hearts. honesty. i luv to fall in luv with honesty. with good healthy, imma tell u the truth. i luv women who keep they legs hairy & their naps natural.  today was a better day in the company.  today was a better day  1. woke up 2. debated working 3. decided against working 4. went to vivas 5. drank pina jugo 6. walked to the starbucks 7. ate banana bread 8. drank c-monster 9. bitterly went to the sprint store 10. went to aveda, liked it 11. went to sum paper store viva worked at.  12. viva bought me sumthing.  13. i luv small gifts, dont u? its a necklace that says live simply.  14. ate curry chikn salad @urth. 15. walked bk to vivas (oh & we went to a garden before urth) 16. drove home, drove to theater, moved car in a rush 17. thought about how happi i am to have the friends in the company. 18. rehearsed before rehearsal (stange, aint it) 19. got tired of writing this list, my attention span aint that long....  20. decided one of the things i need to do is to get in the habit of writing daily again, it brings forth a lot of happiness.   shalom. shalom. shalom.   i want to write u a luv poem  but i dont have the words our luv is not storybook we are not a romantic comedy but we are romantic sumtimes... not those times when i badger u for flowers or u ask me to light a candle we are romantic when we laugh when i jump on the bed to wake u up in the morning when u call me "ugly" or tease me until im angry when i pretend im a superduper rap star & u are my loyal fan i luv u, i luv us. our relationship is so great. i luv our misunderstandings.  we are real ppl

      today was a beautiful day miguel is so marvelous i have never loved sumone in such a healthy way from the moment i awoke i felt beautiful & whole  i just wanted to be closer to him to give him all the love that was inside me & so i did  & it felt so good to love him to be held & to hold him we ate the wonderful food he cooked i played with joseph & we went shopping for a graduation dress he was so patient & present we came home & made love again i fell asleep for ages & read an amazing book i felt like everything was in line  i played with tony those kids make me so happi we watched TV & just kinda smiled at each other i have never felt more beautiful than i do with this man i didnt want to leave him but it felt healthy to seperate knowing that are bond is deeper after today he puts up with alla my shit & i have a lotta shit to put up with.  i came home & realized today is our official  year&1/2 anniversary i called him & we laughed we celebrated all day without even remembering that 1year&1/2 ago was our first kiss on my bed in my room watching kundun the first kiss made me cry & today after making luv i hid the tears in my eyes from  him i didnt want him to see them cuz happi tears are hard for him to understand. that day we ate at versailles. we both had fish, me halibut & him, i dont remember it was our first official date & we were trying to pretend that it wasnt a date, that even though we had acknowledged our attraction, we were not ready to start anything new.  but that afternoon we did. in my room, he grabbed me & kissed me & i felt every moment i had ever lived rush to my lips (drama queen huh?) ok, maybe not all that, but the kiss was amazing. & when we broke up six months ago for 3 days it was the same kiss that brought it all back.  i love u miguel angel ramirez. u are my milensa, my babooshka, my guapo, my baby, my papi chulo u are the best friend i have ever had. besos!

      so, i decided to move back home. after a lot of self-inflicted pain (emotional) yesterday i have decided to move back home. i think its a great idea.   i can have peace of mind, no more living all alone. i will live with a family,  my  family & we will learn more about each other  no money drama. no more rent money going to god knows where   i can write: novels, plays, poems, screenplays, etc. i can learn about being a freelance writer for newspapers & magazines.  i can apply for fellowships in writing & theater  i can walk, go to the gym, etc.  i can get a new car  i can be closer to miguel  i can have more time to play music/write music  one thing: if i do this. i must really do it. i must rest & work on my art like a job. like a real occupation. i must create schedules & routines. in order for success & happiness to be in my life i must begin to develop real adult discipline.   i am happi abt this decision.  __________________________  i am supposed to write a poem about reparations. i feel like i have nothing to say about reparations. maybe i will do a 10 min free write.  +++++++++++++++++++++++ free write #1+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ i am supposed to write this poem about what blk ppl need but i have no idea what we need. i know how much it hurts me everyday to see all of the pain within my family. how the children i touch are so far away that embraces seem impossible. we are grown before our time. we been in the back room fucking boys before we could walk we been passing blunts and sipping on shit we couldnt spell or pronounce or count out the money for but we got it we got it in our pocket and im supposed to write something about what we need we need god not jesus or buddah or kali or yemonja or oya or oshun we need a god a faith a religion we need our old shit back our before the boat shit we need our rituals back we dont have no rituals does reparations give rituals does reparation repair broken hearts does reparations bring back fathers does it repair broken refridgeratiors and lungs does it give parenting skills to the fatherless does it bring back mothers for the motherless does it teach languages that we laugh at does it give peace of mind does it appreciate quiet times does it give me back to the tress do i get to remember red woods with reparations will it repair me will it replace me will it take me back in time or forward is this a forward moving time will it make black men speak to me not about sex but just about the color of a cloud or the regalness of a lion will it turn me back into a lion will i get my smile back will this forhead wrinkle dissappear will u get to keep my weave will it forgive africas debt will africa forever be raped will she always be the worlds goodtime gurl a place to take fromm will she get her own place will she ever be known as a continent of ppl of many of cultures when i was in africa i was happpi i felt like i belonged i felt like everybody who had ever lived on that streatch of land had always known that they were blessed and worhty of love in the eyes of god i do not know how u can bring that knowingness to this land. when i walked around i saw myself everywhere i saw my hair and my frame i saw the beauty of my own eyes i saw my acne and my scars i saw my high butt i saw my shapely sagging breasts hanging from trees i saw my pain i saw my dissapointment that the world wasnt everything it promised to be on first viewing but i saw my hope i saw ppl past hope i saw ppl knowing that this as everything will pass becuz these ppl knew history it was all around them it was cooked at high tempertures on stove tops in big metal pots it was passed in a cup of water or in a smile or in a mothers stern loook history and future were mingled so firmly in present that even aids and poverty and land and violence even these things which mattered so much didnt matter in the way they matter here on this land cuz on that land we were living past hope we were exisiting past faith we were working with sumthing beyond love into the beginning of the color blue we were swimming neck high in menses and oil and snow and sunshine and sand and beaches and oceans oceans were so abundant here. when we are born we are said to be perfect. we all celebrate. ppl bring gifts. we smile. everyone is laughing. everyoe is exicited that a new life has decided to come. despite what they have heard or seen they have decided that the trip is worth it. that they have sumthing to give. a new gift to bring. they have decided that we are worth loving. their journey here is for us to teach them sumthing. when a child is born we know we have sumthing to give. life itself has meaning. but the older they get the less we have to give them. the less we smile at them. when they laugh we turn away. their laugh doesnt hold the newness it held before. we have fallen out of lvoe with the idea of their bearth. we are not enthralled they are not special they are just another human being. i want to be repaired from this. if we are to be given anything i want this. i do not want land or education or money or welfare or actions made affirmatively. i just want when i enter a room for ppl to treat me as if i am new. as if i am infant. as if i am the infant 6 months brewing in the womb. this is what i want. to be able to celebrate each step of my mother as if it is her first. to forgive her quickly because she is so worthy of my love. this is what i want.  _____________________________

      i am so confused about what i am going to with life right now. i feel like im at a crossroads & i dont know where to turn. or maybe i do know where to turn & i am too scared to go the way i should. confession: i want to move in with miguel. honestly, im ready to move in with him. but he isnt ready to live with me yet. maybe he doesnt know if he loves me enough yet. maybe i get on his nerves. i dont know. i still love & need my space but im getting this need to be aroudn him everyday. not in the your space my space way but in the OUR space way.   the most gifted do not recognize their own talent. i was thinking this reading lei's writing. shes gifted. my favorite writer of anyone i know personally but she doesnt recognzie that she is a DAMN good writer. i dont even know about my talent anymore im feeling so creatively dry.   i also am in this needy place. like, i really wish i had a close gurlfriend right now. a close woman best friend. i have sum close friends but i miss shani & robbie & shetia. i useta tell those women everything. & everything changed. i miss bridget. i miss being so close to a woman that i could lay on her & hold her & & cry to her all the time. viva is my friend in that way but i dont know. robbie was real close to my heart. i dont think i know how to maintain good relationships sumtimes. they all end up slipping away. maybe its becuz ive been hurt & im scared to let ppl in. maybe i always think they are goin gto stop liking me, same themes everytime i write. i think about myself all day   SELF ABSORBTION   i am self consumed. i consume myself with yself. i stare in the mirror all day & wonder where im going. nuthing seems as important as my issues what i haveta say has so much weight. my thoughts haveta be shared. i share all the time. im angry. im upset. i cry. i bitch. i complain to much. sumtimes i digust myself. im sick of my own unhappiness. i miss myself when i was free. i miss myself when i was passionate abt sumthing other than me. & my future & my creativity & heart & thoughts & confusion & my past history. i am ashamed to be so self absorbed. i feel like such an american. im always sick & needy. im always talking about what i think & how i feel. who killed the community living in me?

      im feeling funny about a few things  i met with this guy last nite abt sum performance stuff. i cant put my finger on what doesnt sit right about him. i feel like im supposed to teach him sumthing but i dont know what yet, humility, openess, forgiveness. dont know yet. he seemed very full of himself though. i did learn a lot in the conversation though  what i learned  - i need to write what i learn from folks down - what does the day after "revolution" look like. should we live in a constant state of rebellion? what does this mean anyway. - dont name your group sumthing that everyone in the group wont understand, it makes u seem elitist. just cuz its new & complicated doesnt mean its better - highly evolved ppl? its kinda arrogant aint it - it feels really good when sumone understands u - its time for me to read "song of solomon"  but i know for sure this guy is going to challenge me creatively. hes going ot push me to think to dream. "create what is past hope or past faith, what does that look like" i dont know. sumone asked me a question that i didnt know the answer to. aint it a beautiful fucking thing (now who sounds arrogant?)

       can neighbors hear tears thru the walls?   things most ppl dont know abt me  1. i cry a lot. at least 2-3 times a week. sumtimes i like to do it alone. sumtimes i have an audience. can my neighbors hear tears thru these thin ass walls & if they can do they ever wanna come on over  2. im scared to death of so many things. dogs being a big one. since i was a little gurl i was so scared of big dogs jumping on me. im scared of balls too. it might sound silly but im scared that balls will hit me on my head & give me a concussion. im also scared that birds will poop on me. i hate it when birds fly over my head. drives me insane man. im mostly afraid that ppl will fall out of love with me. ive been known to "try to hard" becuz of this fear.  3. i luv 90s rock music. bush, stone temple pilots, metallica, nirvana, etc... mostly what was considered "grunge" music. i LOVE PEARL JAM. im talking about love man. the first 2 albums, know every song word for word. i grew up around a lot of white folks and was always trying to assimilate. i developed a taste for bands like Phish, Weezer, Beetles. I felt like a whitewashed black gurl a lot of my life... now i just feel musically well rounded & experienced. & while we're at it, my first 2 boyfriends bonified white boyz.  4. i always wanted to be a cheerleader. even in college, i was envious of the Dance team. Cheerleaders suck i know, but i wanted to be one, i just sat with the other "daria" gurls and made fun of cheerleaders.   5. now that im telling secrets, i always wanted to be miss america too, disgusting, aint it.  _________________________________ 7 day diet nonis breakup cure (for broken ppl everywhere)  1. buy candles. preferably tall red votive candles. the catholic kinds are nice cuz u can get them in virgen, saint, & jesus varities, those pictures are nice when u are sad. lite the wicks. turn off the lites. lock your door. dont tell nobody u broke up. just lock the door & deal with your shit. take out your SADE CD (everyone should already have one of these) put on the track  love is stronger than pride . this song is honest. u will not get over this soon so just sit in it. it also feels like rushing water. u will feel clean listening to this song. it has lyrics like "things come & go" very zen baby & during breakup time u need zen & realism. this song has both. put this track on repeat. listen for 3 days. take breaks. cry. shower a lot. this will also make u feel better. take baths. remember. get it all out. every memory. remember the good times & the bad. remember her hands. remember his voice. do not call anyone else to talk about this. just sit in your locked room with sade, zen, and those wonderful red roman candles & be broken.  2. when 3 days have past get out the godfather series. u should own this as well. no person should have to rent the godfather or buy a Sade CD, these things should already be in your immediate possession. put on Part 1. Watch, listen, feel the drama. Get lost in the flick. dont think, just watch. If u have tapes, change tapes. If u have DVDs watch the special features. Think about how great Mafia movies are. Think about how important family is. Think about loyalty & tradition & tenancity. Remember that there is more to u then romance, u  have history, u have secrets, u have lies & deceit. u have loving, faithful family. if u dont, u have friends who have now become family. long live the corleone family. find an italian market. eat sum gnochhi. its good. watch part 2 & 3. i know, 3 is kinda slow, but watch it too. taste the bitter with the sweet. welcome balance. this is true love. Do this for 2 days  3.after 5 days. call a friend. bitch. moan. cry. scream. tell it all. call your mama too if shes wise, maybe she'll give u good advice. if your mamas wacko then u have one more friend card. call him/her & cry one more time. dont call them about it again. after the first call, they dont care. they want to, but they cant. u are repeating yourself, u are saying the same thing over & over. no one cares but u. even if they say they wanna hear about your feelings, they are lying, no one really cares but u.   if u like addiction, drink sum, smoke some, fuck some & in 3 months youll be able to feel again. if u are like me & more on the clean tip, repeat steps 1&2 but never ever step 3. u can also pray, mediatate, go hiking, etc. dont ask for advice though, just listen to yourself & wonder if the neighbors can hear u crying at nite.   4.on the 7th day, call the mufuckka who broke your heart & pretend you are over it. please dont beg or relive your 7 day diet drama. just listen to what (s)he has to say for 30 mins (no more) hang up & dont talk again for 3 months.  happy dieting   *sidenote: this diet is as safe & effective as the Atkins & South Beach Diet.
