      mrRee:what up mr joe?  mrJoe:hey dude  mrRee:how's work?  mrJoe:quiet, as usual  mrRee:ahh yes yes...  mrJoe:what you up to?  mrRee:just doing homework here...got 55% of my entire grade tonight.  mrJoe:exam?  mrRee:1 individual final speech, 1 group final speech,and a speech critique no bueno.  mrJoe:sounds exciting.  mrRee:you know it.  individual topic: how to close sales group topic: how to write a good children's book critique: pastor seratt  mrJoe:u gonna sit in on a sermon and take copious notes?  mrRee:lol, just had to write the paper today.  mrJoe:he must have thought you were quite interested.  mrRee:yea...  man, i forget how pretty high school girls can be.  mrJoe:lol  mrRee:hahaha  mrJoe:it's ridiculous isn't it?  mrRee:dropping off pizzas at brophy today... they're all grown up and all the xavier girls were leaving the chapel   mrJoe:it's all good, get you a graduating senior 18; muy bueno  mrRee:crazy... i was dumb founded at how amazing some of the chicas looked...  mrJoe:glory to god  mrRee:whew... almost couldn't drive. amen  mrJoe:He's very artistic  mrRee:"and on earth goodwill TO MEN" so a question... did god make ugly people?  mrJoe:probably, cuz they ain't ugly to him just different  mrRee:i mean, on some level he's got to know that there are one's that aren't that attractive.  mrJoe:i think He knows, how we would see them but maybe He see's it entirely different.  mrRee:being that most pretty girls are universally pretty.... to us, that is. why didn't he just make them all universally pretty   mrJoe:i don't know...  mrRee:He should have  mrJoe:yup  mrRee:then it wouldn't matter... it'd be all good.  mrJoe:but then again...some of us are born with greater abilities than others. and better personalities it's all unfair.  mrRee:yea but you can work hard and still achieve great things, you know, have a lot of heart and still get ahead in life... but if you ugly... ain't much help for that.  mrJoe:well personalities are unique and i would say as much a result of nature as nurture.  mrRee:this is the kicker... what if there is one "best" person out there for each one of us...and she ain't want we'z like... and the point would be God saying... look at her heart though...  mrJoe:could be,could be. it would be a tough lesson  mrRee:like what if there were an undeniable word from God... joe... she's all yours...  mrJoe:it definately could be.  mrRee:no bueno.  mrJoe:that would take a lot of faith.  mrRee:seems to me would be a cruel joke. but maybe not.  mrJoe:mountain moving. i guess i would look at it like this: it's only 40 years.  mrRee:lol. still a long time. my friend... a long time.  mrJoe:yeah...not in relation to eternity though; what if we've already met the "one"...  mrRee:that's to say that it's cool if you have to wait till your 75 to find your wife... and then saying "it ain't TOO long to wait"   mrJoe: ...and they have slipped through our fingers.  it is long only from one perspective.    mrRee:com'on now... whatever happened to the optimistic "if it was meant to be..."   mrJoe: if you really think about it.  that was always you. i never believed in "meant to be"  mrRee:(still is)i know... i'm working on you though. one day. day after your honeymoon.... then you'll know... and you'll be able to say "it was meant to be..."  mrJoe:we'll see.  mrJoe:i dunno "mrRee"  mrRee:what's up?  mrJoe:oh...i'd just rather not think about it i guess. hope awakens desire... but hope awakens a few other things too  mrRee:yea?  mrJoe:i just gotta keep trekking on. career ministry  mrRee:like they say... "keep on keepin on"  mrJoe:that's what's important right now.  mrRee:yea.  mrJoe:friends.  mrRee:you should look for a friend that's a girl. (an ugly one)  mrJoe:lol  mrRee:seriously... cause if she's cute then you might start tah feel "it"   mrJoe:for real.  mrRee:that's the truth you know it.  mrJoe:and that's why i question your " i just want a cute friend"  mrRee:"keepin it reel"  mrJoe:you got lisa it's all good  mrRee:dude... NO. it's not.  mrJoe:just give it a chance.  mrRee:no way.  mrJoe:you never know.  mrRee:yes i do.  mrJoe:you might find the love of your life. God might be like: time "mrRee" it's time she's the one. i want you to learn to love her. hahaha  mrRee:i'm as sure about her as you are about... "tina" . nope. no bueno.  mrJoe:lol  mrRee:remember god knows how much we can handle.... and he won't put us through more than that...  mrJoe:we humans put so much value on physical beauty.  mrRee:...and trust me she'd be way too much.  mrJoe:lol i wonder what my chances are... of meeting another person... that blows me away. i think some people go through life without ever meeting a person like that. i know, i know, my life isn't run by chance...  mrRee:well seeing that there are 6 billion people in the world... it's got to be better than that.  mrJoe:yeah 6 billion but you can start cutting at the number. how many are females then how many of those are in the right age group  mrRee:yah thinK? or you think that most people meet people and don't realize it or don't give it a second thought, but since you may have had a chance...yeah...  remember : love has no age.   mrJoe:well that's all part of the forumla i'm getting at.  mrRee:mistake: knows no age  mrJoe:reasonable age group. then how many will be "all that" to you. and christian and a mature christian and not a jehovah's witness i dunno...the numbers start slimming and then...when you finally get down to that "blow you away" category what are the chances you will ever cross paths. that's what's crazy about it all. the probability is... well miniscule.  mrRee:but it happens everyday.  mrJoe:it happens every blue moon.  mrRee:no... everyday... just like somewhere in the world... i'm sure it's happening even as we speak (or im) perhaps...perhaps not.  i dunno. that's why we're friends... i've got enough optimism for all   mrJoe:lol. you know what i think about?  mrRee:? kids? making babies?  mrJoe:how i want it not to be easy...  mrRee:?  mrJoe:that it will be a challenge to get w/ that person because  mrRee:have to work for it huh?  mrJoe:when the goings get tough i want to be able to look back and be like...this is how much i wanted her.  mrRee:you're "prodded to good works" true true.  mrJoe:you hear from M?  mrRee:nope. not since the reply email.  mrJoe:i see... how are you doing about that whole thing now.  mrRee:i don't... but i have a peace about it.  mrJoe:hmmm...  mrRee:it's all good. like i said, i came to quite the understanding while we were "away"  mrJoe:i don't know if i'm just whack or not...  mrRee:waht? mistake: what?  mrJoe:i just..i have peace about it. but i still long. and the longing can get pretty overwhelming at times. like the peace doesn't replace the pain.  mrRee:that's cool... obviously not the longing... but maybe you're at peace in your spirit...and out of wack in your emotions. ?  mrJoe:that i know.  mrRee:yeah.  mrJoe:like i know it's all good. that it's all in His hands  mrRee:yea.  mrJoe:and that He will take care of it all... and that's right where it needs to be. that it will be the best. His way. but I still feel... it's strange though there are days like today when i feel so objective about it. like i'm outside myself. observing.  mrRee:i've known the feeling.  mrJoe:yeah... like i feel ok today. i don't "feel" the longing but i know it's there. objectively. it's just quieted for now. dude i keep getting these little kids im'ing me. i need a new email address.  mrRee:lol you can't... that's the email you gotta have and you can tell your kids...  mrJoe:they think i'm a girl named Erin or a girl name Joanna  mrRee:it'll be a good story... kinda like "gas"  mrJoe:or a girl named Cheryl  mrRee:lol joe.. is there something you wanna tell me?  mrJoe:i get little high school boys hitting on me. it was funny i got sick of it the other day  mrRee:you know you can open up to me...  mrJoe:this kid kept imming me.  mrRee:i won't judge....  mrJoe:so i finally replied. dude- im's are lame ask her out in person for god sakes.  mrRee:seriously.... you can tell me...  mrJoe:rrright  mrRee:i thought you were acting a bit funny when we were camping....  mrJoe:me? haha what about you  mrRee:hehehe what about me?!  mrJoe:getting crazy w/ cliff in the tent.  mrRee:what?!  mrJoe:and rubbing my nipple.  mrRee:i rubbing?! i was trying to bite!  mrJoe:ah..that's much better.  mrRee:(wink wink) man i'm thinking about going back up there, either this weekend or next... just to hike fossil springs again....    mrJoe:really? lol that was a long hike.  mrRee:it was fun though... i enjoyed it.  mrJoe:i liked when it ended.  mrRee:just gotta find a hiking buddy... and no i'm not asking lisa.  mrJoe:lol dude she would rape you.  mrRee:i know this.  mrJoe:i dunno know about next weekend. but i'd be down... in a while.  mrRee:lol riiiiiight. at least you got your walking stick.  mrJoe:i do. it felt good to do it. after it was done.  mrRee:i know... you need to ... as out of shape as you are... yeah. just make sure you eat... cause if you start doing that, then you'll really be skinny...    mrJoe:i'm goin to start swimming at night.  soon as it's warm enough.    mrRee:you'll go from a 26" waist to like 10.  mrJoe:do some Cardio har har har.

      6/16/04, 3:06 PM mrRee: what's up mr joe?  mrJoe: hey, not a whole lot... how's it goin  mrRee: good ... just got done giving cloey a bath... you know... another exciting day )  mrJoe: off work already?  mrRee: no work on weds. got school.  mrJoe: i see.  mrRee: so how goes work?  mrjoe: freaking sucks  mrRee: better than the normal answer   mrJoe: lol  mrRee: of "another day"  mrJoe: yeah...at least it's more passionate.  mrRee: yea.... finished up my homework and went on a hike today... good times..  mrJoe: hey have you heard of the movie: "What The #$*! Do We Know" ?  mrRee: no.  mrJoe: oh..it looks interesting it's i guess a documentary weaved into a story  mrRee: yea...  mrJoe: and i guess it's mainly about quantum physics and theory of knowledge a cereberal movie i hear it's pretty interesting.  mrRee: yea... i just found some stuff on it... washington times reviewer says.."it is suggested that the reality we live in is not even real. Reality is what we make it to be." mrJoe: yeah... i guess it addresses our perceptions... and our biases, and how they affect what we think we know... but i hear it's quite entertaining. like the way they did the movie.  mrRee: says it focuses on "the power of the mind" and makes references to 1993 some experiment of "meditation" experts to try to "will" the crime rate to decrease.  mrJoe: a couple of my friends saw it.  mrRee: yea?  mrJoe: so i have a question  mrRee: yea?  mrJoe: based on my year or so of working w/ home base... i have noticed..that 99 percent of the people who volunteer at things like this, or shelters...are well... kinda the "freeks and geeks"  mrRee: okay?  mrJoe: like if i were to place them in high school. they would be like the band and drama kids. for the most part...why do you suppose that is? even my buddy Chris told me he was kinda a nerd in high school.  mrRee: well in order to answer that you'd have to look at what the "cool" kids in high school are doing now... pretty much the same things they did in high school.  mrJoe: but what causes the "not so cool" kids to be more altruistic. ? i mean...i recall in high school a lot of them band and drama kids would volunteer for things even back then.  mrRee: okay. so it's not that they changed... it's they they didn't.  mrJoe: i think it's something in the water.  mrRee: i mean... it would seem that their priorities remained the same.  mrJoe: well they weren't born out of the womb like that though..is my point. mrRee: and you know that how?  mrJoe: because i wasn't. perhaps some were. but at the least i can say not all of them were. mrRee: but you weren't a "nerd" in high school either.  mrJoe: right..  mrRee: so you're the one that's different.  mrJoe: i can't imagine i'm the only one that's different. i guess what i'm getting at is..  mrRee: okay then based on your observation that "most" were nerds.. than you're one of the few that are different.  mrJoe: perhaps there is a connection...between people who feel that they don't fit in..and altruism... mrRee: you could attempt to make the connection but i think you'd fail in the effort. look at a lot of the major foundations... they're started by popular, successful people.  mrJoe: successfull and popular ? or successfull. ? think about all the freeks and geeks... from high school  mrRee: yea?  mrJoe: at least from my school... most of them are getting pretty crazy in their careers. u think Bill gates was a pimp? lol  mrRee: yea but bill gates was and still is a nerd.. also considered by most to be a thief... and cheated on his wife.. for the hell of it..  mrJoe: but the man gives a lot to charity.  mrRee: and gets hefty tax write offs for it...  mrJoe: cheating on his wife, and being a thief, doesn't mean he isn't altruistic. he might be morally flawed...  mrRee: and has been convicted of having a monopoly and bullying other smaller companies.  mrJoe: but...those aren't mutually exclusive categories. this isn't a moral issue. the question is what causes people to stray towards altruism. mrRee: but it is... or can be.  mrJoe: is there a connection between that and social misfits? and the key word is connection.  mrRee: i think you have to be careful... with the word "misfits"  mrJoe: like a study/survery in psychology...i wouldn't necessarily fail as you say. because i'm not looking for proof. i'm looking for a trend. a connection. not cause and effect.  mrRee: you would have to make the connection that a majority of "self-less" people are "social misfits"  mrJoe: i doubt i'd have a problem..with that. especially after revising your statement a bit. not "self-less" but active volunteers for charitable organizations. remember that was my original observation.  mrRee: well you didn't say that .. you specifically used the word altruist. or altruism.. which basically means unselfish. there are many a people who volunteer for selfish reasons.  mrJoe: i guess i was using the word alturistic looslely  mrRee: like you were telling me before... people who volunteer because it makes them feel better... well that's not being so much self-less as being selfish. if they didn't feel "better" they wouldn't do it. forget about the people they're helping.  mrJoe: popularly, people use the word altruism, as "do gooders" not necessarily moral people.  mrRee: and then there are the few who do it regardless of self gain.. regardless of how much it sucks.. because in the end they know someone... regardless is benefitting.  mrJoe: not necessarily self less...  mrRee: and there are many "doo gooders" who don't volunteer for lack of time...  mrJoe: dude... mrRee: but they may contribute $50,000 which plays just as significant a role.  mrJoe: you're being ridiculous now. stop. mrRee: and how's that?  mrJoe: well you're arguing for the sake of arguing.  mrRee: no...  mrJoe: that's a whole other tangent lack of time? giving money that's not what i was talking about. at all. that's another chapter.  mrRee: well i'm just saying there are a lot of things you need to consider.. such as... a lot of the "popular" kids in school may be pro athletes or doctors or lawyers or huge business men who can't afford the time to go and volunteer 4 or 5 hours a week.... but they may give to charities... and to say that the people who are physically volunteering are doing any more than the people funding might be incorrect.  mrJoe: ah.... but i didn't say that. that's what i mean...you're bringing conclusions in...and arguing them as if i said them.. but that's the thing. you said it.  mrRee: but you made the observation that the "nerds" are the ones volunteering.. and you were wondering if there is a "connection" between "social mis-fits" and altruism. and i'm saying that you can't go strictly on your observation because you're not taking some large factors into consideration. and that's the time factor.  mrJoe: again, my "study/survey" is not who is doing more good. who is more "self-less" or moral.  mrRee: and i'm not saying that...  mrJoe:? you wrote: and to say that the people who are physically volunteering are doing any more than the people funding might be incorrect.  mrRee: i'm just saying that unless you consider all these other factors you couldn't come to a complete conclusion.  mrJoe: again my friend, you are jumping the gun. complete conclusion?  mrRee: yea.  mrJoe: i never said i wanted one. psychology is never conclusive. i could draw trends cite phenomena's...  mrRee: if you did a survey of people who volunteer.. and you said you were pretty sure, you'd find that the "nerds" were the ones volunteering for the most part .  mrJoe: but it's not a complete conclusion. yeah... then i could say..hey..there tends to be a trend. and then perhaps you could look at why? but i ain't goin that far chief. i don't need a cause and effect answer. i can't think of a single cause and effect answer in all of social pyschology.  mrRee: but remember you were wondering about the "connection" between nerds and volunteers, more specifically "what causes the "not so cool" kids to be more altruistic."  mrJoe: ok...even so, again it would be all things considered...but my point is..you need not bring in the thought that I am seeking who is on higher moral ground. and i'm simply saying you can't answer that question without first proving that  they are...  mrRee: and my point was not to equate a higher moral ground... although i'm sure you and i would both consider it "better" to be self-less than selfish  mrJoe: we know there is not direct correlation between active volunteerism and morality (especially since morality is seen as highly subjective/cultural/conditioned responses.) i think the act of it is a good act. but those very people are morally corrupt too. *may be morally corrupt.  mrRee: true and ... well i'd better not get myself started  so bz day?   mrJoe: pretty darn slow. whens class?  mrRee: 6pm so... i'm doing a lot better with the whole relationship thing.  mrJoe: are you? what's new?  mrRee: just over the past few weeks been working on getting to know God more... build a relationship... and last night i was driving home from the gym.. and really, for probably one of the first times in my life... felt a trust... i should more correctly say.. a rumble in my faith... just an assurance and a peace that comes from being able to just trust him... you know? and of course i'm not negating the possibility of loneliness or what not...  mrJoe: hmmm... you know sunday night.  mrRee:?  mrJoe: i guess it was actually the afternoon i was headed to the mall. and i just started singing. praising. and it was overwhelming. and for that moment i knew true bliss. i think i'm doing better too..w/ the relationship thing.  mrRee: yea. well like today i was just walking through the mall buying some stuff... and normally i'd start looking around and be like {sigh} one for me please? but as i looked and admired God's handy work... i noticed that's all it was, an admiration... and then i had that same peace... that it's all in his hands.  mrJoe: lol yeah... i was driving today... to work and thinking...of how i want to be w/ someone. and i still desire her. but...  mrRee: butt...  mrJoe: i dunno...i'm living, breathing, moving along. i'm not even sure i need anyone. i mean i do in one sense. and in another i don't. you know?  mrRee: yea... i about gotta go... but think about about this one. did God's master plan really have woman in it? i mean of course...but look at it this way. God, knowing that Jesus would have to die for us... created us none the less... but i'm sure he'd have preferred some other way... either way.. so he creates adam and places him in the garden. (here's the 1st ?, why didn't he create eve at the same time?) and next. why did he wait until adam felt a longing until he created eve? i mean if it was his intention to create both why not together or why wait...  mrJoe: hold on a sec.  mrRee: i was thinking...maybe it's a fundamental flaw in man. God would have rather us not needed "woman" and just commune with him... but being created human and imperfect... it's a flaw in us?  mrJoe: yeah...i've been thinking about that stuff too.. like was it a flaw in adam? but i think the word would articulate that, you would think?  mrRee: i don't know.  mrJoe: but it was God who says "it's not good for man to be alone" but we know people who have been celibate and content. so it's clearly possible for man to find completeness in God.  mrRee: but if you really read.. look God says it's not good for man to be alone...  mrJoe: in fact...everyone we know is going to face this one time or another in their life.  mrRee: so what happens next.? he creates animals. and adam names them and still didn't find a "helper" comparable to him...  mrJoe: hmmm..  mrRee: so then God created eve.  mrJoe: God the problem solver...  mrRee: interesting how i never noticed that flow of events until just now  ?  mrJoe: why in his omniscience... does he seem to operate like reasoning man. or is this going back to God being outside of time.  mrRee: who knows my friend... not i... not i... i'm gonna get ready for school. mrJoe: alright  mrRee: i'll talk to you l8er...  mrJoe: yup.  mrRee: thanks for the chat. peece.  mrJoe: ;o)

      So I agree and disagree...  The book does NOT say life is rubbish... It states quite clearly that life WITHOUT God is rubbish.  Remember that life initially was designed to be with or commune with God.  So by default, life was meant to be good and fulfilling, and because of man now we live a life without God.  I think one can look at this point as just a “particular arrangement of words” but I think it’s important to state that life with God, which was by design, is good, and everything in it was designed to enjoy.  I think that the distinct difference between Cobain, Presley, and Solomon is that in his own writing Solomon didn’t recognize that “all” was vanity until... When?  Not until he backslid.  Which makes me wonder why?    Interesting verse that you bring up too... When you look at the previous couple of verses it speaks of treasure in the sense of earthly “recognition” the way the Pharisees pray.  And then when you look following it talks about not being able to serve both God and “mammon” or money.  If you take into account the other parables about money that Jesus speaks of, you find that he is speaking about placing too much emphasis on money and trying to hoard it all up, save it and protect it... I think by this scripture he’s merely stating the obvious that you can’t take anything from earth with you.    I mean if you just go back to proverbs God states: Riches and honor are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  ... “to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.” It seems clear, also seeing that both David and Solomon were the two richest kings in history... Remember too, that inheritance for your children is a large part of the old testament that was not refuted or changed under the new covenant and therefore still holds true.  So, by this we can conclude that Jesus didn’t mean don’t have any money left on earth when you die... Because it is all in vain.  Onto the other note.  I think that you make a valid point, by stating that there are cases where the lines between material “means” and when people actually begin to worship the “means” becomes blurred.  And who’s to say (without further study) that was the case with Solomon.  One thing we have to keep in mind though that prosperity was a good thing, both in the old and new testaments.  And that EVERYTHING in the house of God was the BEST.  You’re talking Gold, Cedar, all hand crafted, only the best... And this wasn’t just in the holy of holies where God dwelt... Even in the outer court yards... The alter for sacrifice, the Priests’ robes... Everything was top notch..and people get offended because they find out the church bought $100,000 worth of camera equipment, or that the new facilities cost $45 million.  Let’s not forget that David’s largest lump sum offering equated to over $145 million dollars... And it didn’t dent his bank account.   I think it’s clear that there is nothing wrong with wanting the “best” the bible says we should be the head and not the tail, the first and not the last, above ONLY and never beneath... I think that to limit that to a “spiritual” or “emotional” context is limiting God.  Also, to say that because it’s easy for us to lose track of our priorities, and that because the potential exists for us to look to money or cars as altars doesn’t justify not having them.  I mean, on that premises you could say the same thing about expensive foods, having children, reading a book, or getting married; we can’t deny that many a Christians have fallen away due to their spouses.  I think even the desire for knowledge or love could be put in the same boat... Where you want so much to know “things” know “answers” that you forget, or lose track of the most important thing... I was listening to Ravi, that cd on worship, and he talks about the void within people..and how love is only a part of filling that void... That the true meaning of our existence... The reason for being, for our creation... Was to worship God.  So we may look for love, or knowledge, or money... I think they’re all in the same boat.. For every person who wants to make three extra dollars, there a fella who wants to know “” this much more... And there’s another guy who just wants to experience a little more love... I think they’re all in the same boat and it would be difficult to say one outweighed any other.   Humbly learning from each debate, MrRee-theous.

      hey,   I agree with you, this book was never a book of doctrines per se...  It's a book of perspective.  And it's a book of common sense.  Still, it maintains a great deal of profound truths.  It says life in and of itself is rubbish, but we know this.  We know this because people like Solomon.  They that have had it all, but found no true joy INHERENTLY in those things, they have reiterated the idea of Ecclesiastes throughout history.  It's as plain as, "look both ways before you cross the street," it doesn't take a biblical doctrine to teach us this, it takes history.   Still we see it today, we see it in the Kurt Cobains, and Elvis Presleys, who have everything, but the only thing that really matters, in the end.    It was Jesus who said:  "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;   for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. "  Perspective.  Further, an important point to keep in mind when studying Ecclesiastes, is that Solomon often uses the euphemism "Under the sun" and this is commonly understood as meaning apart from God, or apart from eternity.  So he is talking about worldy things within the context of this life alone...  In which case, Solomon could not be more correct, it is indeed " all vanity, a mere chasing after the wind."  Solomon may have come to the point where he was chasing those things, his joy depended on those things...and so he could clearly see that it was all a trivial pursuit.     If you recall what Elderidge was saying in "The Journey of Desire,"  he essentially said that we were attempting to rebuild Eden on earth, but that this was futile because of the reality and consequences of Sin.    On a side note, I was thinking about some stuff...  We all like stuff, some more than others, and again some less than others.  And we all know we are not to put our hope in the material, the fleeting.  We know what this means conceptually, but what about practically?  Don't our actions speak about where we have placed our hope?   The majority of Christians know that it is the "LOVE of money" that is the root of all evils, they know that it's ok to own money, as long as "money doesn't own you."  But what does this mean in real practical terms....?  How do you know when you are starting to love money, when it is starting to own you?  I don't think sirens and fireworks go off when one has crossed the line, but rather it probably happens quite subtly... i imagine it creeps up on you through your daily choices...again I imagine it would be like any other addictive sin, that we will attempt only to justify it to ourselves... the love of money hmm.  If we are not to love money, what does that mean for my daily choices?    "The things you own, end up owning you..." - Fight Club  I don't know dude, I guess I have grown weary in sharing what I believe about materialism, that is at least with "word of faith Christians."   I don't think we SHOULDN'T have anything material, (I remember our discussion long ago)...I just think we shouldn't place such a high value on them, (and I think that was what I was trying to express years ago, metaphorically), we shouldn't spend so much of our time, our precious lives, our energy, obsessing over material goods, and the false promises that advertising has us believing.  It makes us look foolish, like there is no heaven.  Like this is it.    Perhaps we might place more value on helping others, living as servants, living the reality that this life is so short, and that we have a proper eternal perspective on our priorities...ah the gospel.   Perhaps we need to live lives that testify to the truth that this world and all in it will be destroyed, and that our heaven is not here, our paradise is not here...        ...and I myself, most of all..."

      Hey,  So I started reading Ecc. And it’s a pretty interesting book.  I hadn’t read it for sometime so I was “enlightening” to say the least... So I’m reading it and in midst reading I looked at proverbs and started to look at the difference between the two... I mean it’s certain that Solomon wrote Proverbs (at least the first 26 or so books) and accepted that he wrote Ecc.  I just noticed the difference in tone between the two books.  Proverbs almost immediately starts out that God will take care of the righteous.  He pleads with the young to listen to him that they may have a long life and peace in that life.  He goes on to say “Honor the Lord with your possessions, And with the firstfruits of all your increase; So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine”   I just noticed it’s almost a polar opposite from Ecc. And I couldn’t figure it out (at first) I was thinking to myself.  Man, what changed? What’s the difference in Solomon’s life?  In one book he basically says it’s all good to “have” things and in Ecc. He basically comes to the conclusion that “it all sucks and is all vanity” so I started studying and found a couple of interesting things about Ecc.    Nowhere in the book does God speak.  Meaning in the entire book there is no prophecy and no message from God.  next it would appear that Solomon wrote it while he was in a backslidden state.  As he states “And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness(1) and folly(2): I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.”  to shine; to make a show; to boast; to clamorously foolish; to rave; to celebrate; to show or display loss of self-control; to rave with self-conceit silliness. Translated as folly or foolishness  So now it begins to make more sense... That of course if you were backslidden everything is vanity.  Life is vanity.  Like he says “Yet, better than both is he who has never existed, Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun”  And he even goes on to say  “Better a poor and wise youth, Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more” (could he be talking of himself? Remembering that he did not have a pleasant childhood and that David had to step down as king while he was still alive due to the struggle for power, and this was unprecedented for a King to give up his throne while he was still living.)
