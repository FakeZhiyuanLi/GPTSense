       Well, I know I already slapped a post on this thing once today, but I can't seem to fall asleep, so here I sit again!      I blame my inability to sleep on the calls I've been getting around this time every night.  Not that I mind, understand.  I love getting those calls.  They have just been hell on my sleep.  I guess I shouldn't say "blame" then, either...because one never knows when lovely phone calls might just end.  So, I'll just thank my lucky stars for them.      I guess I could also blame the lack of sleep on the Olympics.  Silly, I know, but I just plain got sucked in.  By swimming that is...the rest of it doesn't interest me all that much.  I've watched some REALLY inane things trying to catch swimming.  And my TIVO has been some sort of full.  But swimming is finally done, so I'll actually have to GO to swim meets in order to get my fix now.  Less lost sleep!      I did manage, however, to make it through one full day without an assload of drama.  Don't ask me how, I really don't know, but it was a welcome change.  No arguments.  No yelling.  No hanging up.  So I can count today as a good day...I think.      Anyway, time to go do other things...      Until next time....      CC

         Welcome to my blog.  I can't promise big and bold.  I don't DO big and bold.  I just sort of AM, ya know?  So, I suppose you're wanting basic info on me.  So follow me into my world for just a few.  The name is CC...but you can call me...well...you can either call me CC or Queen of the Fly.  One of these days I might just tell you what that means, but today is not that day.  Anyway, I am currently 25, but, come August 26th I will be...ironically, 26.  I may be young, but I don't always feel that way.  Sometimes I feel far, far older.  Life has taught me lessons that I can only hope the children I plan to have one day will never, ever need to learn.  I have a job in public relations.  I love it, I really do, but my heart lies in journalism.  I recently acquired a position with a local newspaper.  I'm nothing more than a glorified intern.  I get coffee, I run memos...and, if I'm lucky, I get to proofread copy.  But, if that's what it takes...well...I'll lick the soles of shoes if I must!  As for my love life, early in the year I lost my fiance to a firefight in Iraq.  I spent several months hiding from life and not dealing with the pain.  But, as the year has wound on, I have begun to take care of myself, both physically and emotionally.  I've recently met someone who, while I don't know where it will go, fills my life with a great deal of joy.  Do I know if I will ever be able to commit to a marriage again?  No, I really don't.  But I do know that, for know, this person knows that he can make me laugh and smile.  And, right now, that's more than enough for me.  So, there you have it, the dull and boring details.  One never knows when I just might have a few more dull and boring details to go over with you.   Until next time...   CC
