      Nerds... Having graduated from Computer Engineering at UP, I have known a lot of nerds in my life.  Heck, I may even be a nerd myself!!! hahaha. I admit that I have had bouts of nerdiness in my life. Glasses (even braces in grade school), disheveled hair, lack of interest in social interaction, patronizing attitudes at certain low-watt bulbs in the goup... But for most part, nerds are nice folks. Never bothering anyone, never getting in the way, never imposing, just existing.  Behold, the NERD-PUTZ! He is in every essence a nerd... but with a heavy dose of putziness. The mere sight of him or the sound of his approaching footsteps will make you cringe.  He is the nerd but without the unimposing, non-bothersome characteristic.  He imposes himself on EVERYONE. "Oh, look see, I know this. I'm so great at this. I know Mr.partner this. Mr. partner that is so cool. We're tight, you know." He is the nerd who thinks of himself as the coolest thing on the planet. He will ask for your opinion but never actually listen to you. He will even flat out ask for someone else's opinion while your still answering his question. Suggestions he makes will not actually improve anything, they will just showcase what spectacular techie-knowledge he has. In the end, you are left with thinking of a do-able solution for yourself and a sense of annoyance that your time was wasted on listening to someone show off about how great he is and how much he knows. He also has no sense of respect for other people's free time.. His motto in life is "nerdiness is godliness".  If you don't do overtime, he thinks you are a slacker who will not get anywhere in this life. He will always suggest you work at the most inconvenient time for you before looking on other more acceptable options. He doesn't realize that people don't enjoy working during their free time (no...duh!).  So here I am now -- doomed to interact with the nerd-putz on a daily basis. Yet another one of the occupational perks in this ho-hum corporate existence of mine. Care to trade places?

      So here I am again... yet another mind-numbing day at the office. I'm not sure what I hate more, nothing-to-do-but-sit-and-stare-blankly-at-my-pc-screen or help-me-lord-i'm-going-to-die-if-one-more-issue-comes-my-way. The former is more relaxing but it gets old after about 2 hours and you just wanna scratch your eyes out. The latter on the other hand is action packed and requires me to rush from my desk to the printer and back again, to explaining to managers who have little or no technical knowledge, to the other teams to "consult" (a.k.a. bug them until they relinquish info I need), to speed dialing whatever-god-forsaken-country to talk to some non-english-speaking client and try to come to a compromise that will be very very hazy to everyone and will launch future discussions of what exactly it was we agreed on. Those are the two kinds of days that we have at this wonderful (*SARCASM*) corporate world of ours. So which do I hate more... neither! They are both equally apalling and I will die a happy girl if I never have to go through another day of boredom or woking-til-I-drop.   Unfortunately, in order to survive and pay the bills in the real world, I actually have to show up for work and endure this torture each and every day. The excitement will come from "I wonder what today will be like?"... WOOOPEE. I'm ecstatic.

      1. Why am I here when I don't want to be here? 2. Why is the PUTZ paid more than me when he does absolutely nothing but read e-mails all day? 3. Who invented this nice little relaxing zen fountain that is keeping me from murdering the PUTZ in the next cube?  4. What the hell is a TN5250 protocol and why is PUTZ  spamming my mail with messageboard posts about them? 5. If he actually understood what the crappy TN5250 protocol and 5250 emulation is, why is he bothering me about it? 6. Again, why am I even putting up with this nonsense? 7. Is murdering a person nobody likes considered a crime or a service to humanity? 8. If I do humanity a service, will I be promoted for it? 9. How long can I go on sick leave before they start to realize I'm only faking an illness? 10. Is "sickness of work" a valid reason for calling in sick? 11. What forces in the universe conspired to get me where I am at this moment? 12. Is this the universe's idea of a sick joke? 13. Will things ever start to look up? 14. I'm looking up. Has the sky always been blue? 15. Why not pink? It's much prettier... 16. Thinking on a miniscule scale, do positrons and electrons have some effect on a person being positive or negative? 17. If I get bombarded with extra positrons, will I have a more positive outlook on things?  18. Or just go KAPUT in a grand nuclear-type explosion? 19. Will the fusion concept work on people?  20. If you bombard me with another negative person, do we spontaneously explode and take the whole gadam building out?

      I am bored.  Very very bored.  What should I do? Count how many time I yawn today? Drink coffee and hope the caffeine kicks in and jolts some life into me? Have a pointless discussion with the house putz (yes, even conversing with the PUTZ is better than this state of boredom I am currently trapped in)? Crash the servers I am hosting (sounds good but it could mean the end of my so-called-career)?   Absolutely nothing to do.  I should've called in sick today.
