       I was woken by the sound of a crash. I ran to my window to investigate, I saw a car top side smashed against next doors wall. The engine was a blaze and I saw someone inside. I ran out side. As I got closer the heat increased, I was sweating loads. I as I pulled the man out from under the car he made some sort of groaning noise. I told said in a clam voice “ It will be all right mate” and he groaned again. I dragged him away from the heat and laid in front of my door. I stood up and looked at him closely. I noticed many bleeding bite marks. I decided to go inside and get him some bandages. As I was returning I herd more groaning so I rushed to the door. As I open the door he was standing there looking at me, with his mouth open. I said while thinking “When did you get a burst of strength”.  He didn’t reply he just looked at me. Then all of a sudden he launched at me, not with his fist with his whole body. He went for neck trying to bite me. I pushed him off. He we went back but started to walk towards. I started to walk backwards. As walked I looked at him, he looked almost dead. He was pale and he walk with a strange limp. I was thinking that he was a zombie but I didn’t want to expect it. I had now came a good distance away from him but I was backed up against a wall. He looked at me and from nowhere he started to run. I was quick to react to not quick enough. He was on my tail. I ran into the garden, as I ran I saw my shed. I ran in a locked the door after me. I sat at the back of the shed scared out of my skin. I through the only way to get out is to retaliate. With this through in mind to look for a weapon. Then as searched I saw it laying on a self. A weapon that was my best hope. It was my petrol chainsaw. I looked at the fuel gage I was fuel. He or it was still banging on the door. With this my rage grew. I start the chainsaw and gave it a couple of revs. This my rage I opened the door. He burst in. He lifted his arms to gain a bite but stuck the chainsaw straight into his stomach. Blood spurted everywhere, but this didn’t stop him so I gave him a body slice from shoulder to leg. This sliced threw him like a knife to hot butter. Blood was now everywhere including on me. I walked out with a smile on my face, but that b****** wasn’t dead, he grabbed my leg and tried to take a chunk out. Before he could do this though I sliced with a clean cut. I said knowing he was dead “my first blood”.

       Hey it is now the holidays and ive deciced to train for my new hobbie.  This is  E.A.T.S.A.M.T.J  or  Extreme and totally suicidal and metal tree jumping . I got the idea after jumping out of trees down at national. Also after i sore some year 9's roll over a wall and say they are the best i had to prove them wrong.  This isnt only jumping out of a tree., it consiste of the following. + Tree falling ranging from 5feet to 20feet+ + Tree hoping ( hoping from tree to tree) + Sand banking ( jumping it sandbanks from high distences) + Tree slicing ( jumping for tree of differents heights)

       I re-entered my house. I still had my chainsaw in my hand. I had blood all over me, it smelt revolting. I dropped my chainsaw at the bottom of stairs and went into the bathroom. I splashed water of my face to get rid of the blood. As I looked in the mirror I saw my wet face. I had got a black eye from somewhere. I went back down stairs and grabbed my chainsaw on the way. I went into the kitchen and got a bite to eat. After this a proceeded into the living room, I sat down and turn on the T.V. There was no signal, went up to the T.V and gave it some kicks but this didn’t change anything. After this went and tried the phone and there was no dial tone. At this point I was scared, there was no way of me know what had happened. The only way I could contact people was if I went outside. I didn’t want to but I had to. I opened my front door, the world looked no different. I walked out towards the sidewalk, I looked down and up my street. I saw nothing, I heard nothing too. I started to jog down my street, As I jogged I pear into houses and gardens just looking for anyone. Then all of a sudden I heard a scream. I ran through someone’s garden looking for this person. Then I heard it again. I looked over the back fence and saw this girl backed up against a garage door with 3 zombies walking towards her. I quickly hopped over the fence. I sprinted toward undead. As I ran I started up my chainsaw. I took the first zombie out with a clean cut from it head to it legs. Brains and guts went everywhere. With the second zombie I went straight for it neck. But this one was a harder, my chainsaw cut out while I chopping at this guys head. I ripped the chainsaw out from this neck but he was still alive, so I grabbed his head and gave this body couple of elbows. This left this head detached for his body. I still had the head in my hand so dropped it to the ground. I tried to start my chainsaw but it wouldn’t. Then all of a sudden the third zombie turned round and started on me. I walked backwards trying to start my chainsaw but it was still dead. Then from nowhere *bang*, the zombie flew sideways and again *bang* the zombie stood up with 2 holes in his torso. Then with my 5th try my chainsaw started, so I launched my self at it. I stabbed my chainsaw into its stomach and rip upwards. Blood spurted all over. The zombie dropped too the ground and I said “ This is real, Oh my god”. I turned around to see who had helped me and this guy was there welding a shotgun. As he came closer I noticed he was wearing a blue hoodey, black jeans and backwards baseball cap. He walk up to me and said “ Hey I’m Mike”. I replied by saying “Hey I’m Wez”. We both turned to the dead zombies and he said to me “Is this your first kill”. I looked at him and said “No its my second, Third and forth”. He looked at me, laughed and said “You don’t hold back do you”
