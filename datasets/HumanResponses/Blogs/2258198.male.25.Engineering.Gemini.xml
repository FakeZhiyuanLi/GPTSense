      Well, I just finished the first  The Legend of Zelda  game originally for the NES and decided to quit after beating the first dungeon of the second quest because I need to go to bed at some point. Still, that game's fucking great. The replay factor still holds up to this day.  Anyway, Thanksgiving was good. I made and ate a shitload of food and had a good time with my family. Yup, not much else to say about that... it was just a good time. I love this holiday.  Anyway, that brings us to now. Today I saw a friend of mine who was home for the holiday. This kid's a Michigan theater grad who now lives in New York so he's pretty into the theater scene. Alright,  really  into the theater scene. While I was over at his place, he played some excerpts from the musical  Avenue Q  for me (in addition to his in progress Martha Stuart centered musical which was really funny, but I won't really get into that). So normally I'm not a huge musical fan. I enjoy certain ones:  Phantom ,  Tommy , I actually really enjoyed  Moulin Rouge ,  South Park: Bigger,Longer and Uncut , etc. Oh, I almost forgot, the film version of  Singing in the Rain  is the fucking bomb.  So this afternoon I had listened to parts of the  Avenue Q  soundtrack, now I own it. This is funny as hell. I mean I think if I play it for a  urlLink few   urlLink people  they might enjoy at least a quarter of it, and these guys hate musicals. But really, how can you go wrong with a musical parody of sesame street (complete with puppets, including a version of Bert and Ernie where the Burt character is gay and has a crush on the straight Ernie character), about not knowing what to do after college and how much life sucks, containing songs like  Everyone's A Little Bit Racist ,  The Internet Is For Porn ,  What Do You Do with a B.A. in English?  and  Schadenfreude  (happiness at the misfortune of others). And, to top it all off, Gary Coleman, of  Different Strokes  fame, is the neighborhood super (of course, Gary is played by a short black woman). So now all that's left for me is to hopefully see the show at some point in my life because I hear it's a good time.  So that's it, that was my music purchase for the day. Oh, I also did break my vow to not go hit the stores today (I hate people), but it really wasn't bad later in the day today. Apparently, the psychos (read:soccer moms) had gotten their booty and left. Oh yeah, I also picked up  What's Important To Pathetic  Losers  - Someday's Dreamers  so I was pretty happy about that too. Overall, another good day. Sorry about being all upbeat recently, I know that it's probably annoying at times so I'll try to knock it off and rant about shit that pisses me off more (______ knows there's enough of it). But remember these words of advice: "In volatile market, only stable investment is  porn !"

      In spell checking my last post, I ran into the following question. How do you take the word  palacial  and get a suggested replacement of  blackly ?

      So, it's 5-am and I can't sleep, therefore, I'm going to 'blog. Ok, actually I'm going to 'blog and read  urlLink Fe  as lo and behold, it's been updated (I knew it would be after finding out about the whole house/cat/broadband fiasco).  So it's probably bad that I'm up at this hour, being that I have to be up at nine to stuff the bird and get it into the oven (not to mention wrapping it in it's sheath of bacon). I love stuffing the bird. Ok, I love eating the stuffing that I've stuffed the bird with. My wife used to stuff the turkey with lemons, oranges, garlic and onions because she didn't think that she liked stuffing. Then I made her the real stuff... Kellog's. You see, my family has never been a Stove Top family (possibly too sweet for my tastes as I like the spice). The Kellog's has always been bar none the best stuffing out there if you ask me and nothing else will do for a feast of the magnitude of Thanksgiving. The problem is that it's hard to find because not many places carry it. Every year, without fail, we end up spending the week up until the day before looking around and trying to find the good stuff. Usually by the fifth or sixth store we start to panic (memories of the terrible year we had to buy something else). Eventually (sans the bad year) we find it and all is well, but it's the same every year. This was no different. We went to about a half-dozen supermarkets and couldn't find it. Then my mom suggested Grocery Warehouse, the low-rent Albertsons. Looking down the aisle I was about to give up when I saw it,  The Magical Kellog's Stuffing Display . Thinking back on the week, wondering if we would have our beloved stuffing this year, I made a decision right then and there... I now have twelve bags in my pantry (it takes 3-4 to stuff a bird). At least next year I won't have to go through this.  So yeah, still can't sleep. It's simply the sheer excitement, not only because it's my favorite holiday, but because this has just been a damn good month in general. Cracker,  urlLink BLM  getting a job and moving into his phat palacial estate, getting curtains for our home and the downstairs finally coming together. Little stuff, I know, but it's made my month. Which leads me to the next big exciting reason this month is great  Nintendo LameCube . You see, I was figuring on buying one for Christmas as they finally found a way to sucker me in with  Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles . I was a little disappointed that the broke me so easily as I've been against most of Nintendo's crappy choices lately. So today, while on the stuffing hunt, we stopped by Best Buy  after hitting JCP to look for a nice Thanksgiving tablecloth (go to Target, they have a better selection). Then I saw it, they had the LameCube packaged with a disc featuring the old NES  Legend of Zelda  games. It's fucking sad and I know it sounds blown out of proportion for a material possession but I could barely move I was so excited. My wife asked if I was ok and I told her that I would be if we went home with one of these. Of course, we bought it and since we got home I've gotten through level 8 on the first game and it's awesome. I mean, once again this sounds sad, but I never thought that I'd be playing these games via a console again. What a good fucking day.  So that's my post for now. I'm just having a great time right now with almost everything and yeah. What a good month.  Oh, yeah, I almost forgot:   Happy Fuck Off Puritan Day!

      So, I'm here at work now, with about an hour to go in my day and I have complete lack of motivation to do anything. I'm mere minutes away from vacation. Five days of no work. And to top it off, this is vacation for my personal favorite holiday... Thanksgiving. Oh, believe me, I know that most of the reasoning behind this holiday is self-congratulatory bullshit for my fellow Americans, but that doesn't mean the food isn't great.   First a comment on the self-congratulatory bullshit part. I just though of a joke courtesy of  urlLink Greg Proops :    You know, in Britain they celebrate thanksgiving, they just have a different name for it. They call it "Fuck off, puritan!"   I love that joke simply for the truth in how unwelcome our ancestors (not necessarily genetic ancestors, but ancestors to all Americans nonetheless) were anywhere. Are anywhere. Man, fuck puritans. You realize how much better our society could be if we didn't still hold a lot of their ignorant bullshit. Fuck! I'd like to elaborate but that might be a really long post and I'm almost at the half-hour until vacation point. If someone reminds me in the future, I'll do my fuck puritans post in the future.  As for the food, I'm salivating just thinking about it. We've got a 16-lb turkey sitting in the refrigerator right now and I'm going to go out and buy the Kellogg's stuffing on the way home tonight (gotta' love 24-hour grocery stores) because, it's the only stuffing I really like. Hey, if anyone is looking for a suggestion on foods, a favorite of mine we got from my wife's uncle's boyfriend who attended culinary school. It'll clog an artery, but hot damn, is that good eatin'. What you do is fry up some bacon to start, then save the bacon grease and use it to fry up some onions and Italian flat beans (the large flat green beans). Then you drain off the grease and crumble the cooked bacon into the beans and onions. Yeah, eat it on a regular basis and you'll die tomorrow, but fuck is it good!  In the "the Prophet" household, bacon has always been a staple of the Thanksgiving meal. Especially when it comes to the turkey. Hear me out on this one. Season the outside of the turkey like you normally would (I like garlic, onion, salt, pepper, lemon and rosemary) then cover the turkey in a sheath of bacon. The whole fucking thing. Trust me on this one, the flavor it adds is amazing, and the bacon tastes amazing when the turkey's done.  Ok, if I keep going on this route, I may die of lust for the upcoming meal and that would be bad, because it's our first year having thanksgiving at our place. Oh, I'd also miss the meal if I died and that would be bad. I really have no concluding statement for this post so I will end with a little bow (George Carlin Reference).

      So it has been demanded by the H-Dogg over at  urlLink Fe  that I must update my 'blog. The main problem with that is that I really have nothing to say at the moment. Not a goddamn thing hits me. I also am having some trouble figuring out the direction to go with this 'blog. I don't want to go with my rants on politics because, really, I tend to have the same types of opinions you find on  urlLink Fe  and it will just sound like some lame re-hash. Seriously, even when we disagree, we usually get into a debate and one of us realizes the other's opinion is more rational and we then come to the same conclusion. It's actually kind of sick. I guess that's to be expected when two guys have spent countless years sharing a brain. We used to say that we shared half a brain and each of us had our own half... but fuck that! We're so fucking brilliant that we have three between the two of us. And if you think that that's an arrogant statement, you can kiss my ass! It'd only be arrogant if it wasn't true. (Besides, I always follow the maxim, "Don't be humble, you're not that good." Except I am that good, I just don't want to be humble.)  So then the other direction I could go is doing reviews, of sorts. Normally, I'd be able to do music reviews pretty easily but I have this problem. You see about a year ago John, over at  urlLink IHNL  got me into a little thing called anime. Since that point my spending money has been funneled away from music. I even let my subscriptions to  urlLink CMJ  and Spin lapse. Ok, I was kind of looking for an excuse to let the Spin subscription lapse because... Spin sucks (hence, no link). I mean, there were signs, but the moment Pink showed up on the cover, I knew it was over.  So music is out because I just don't buy enough anymore. I could do anime reviews, but I think  urlLink John  has the anime covered way better than I ever could so that's out.   So yeah, I'm not sure where to go at this point.  Hey, you know what I just realized, I don't need a direction for this site. It's my goddamn site and I'll put whatever the hell I feel like writing on it. Fuck you people for making me think I needed a  direction ! You all can just suffer through my writings on random things on my mind and you can like it too!   Man, I feel a lot better now.

      Ok, I know I keep taliking about the  urlLink UCB  and it's probably getting annoying but I wanted to share with you my new favorite dry humor joke:   Two men walk into a bar and one of them splits his head open... on it.   I don't know why, but I thought that was fucking hilarious.

      Sorry about that. In the tradition of Explaining The Joke, "Red Wings" is what you call it when you go down on a girl having her period, then you come up and have the blood all around your mouth. I know that you really didn't want to know that, but it's my site title so... sorry.

       Alright, here's a real post, not like the other posts tonight, which have simply been birthed by other posts. An acutally, honest to (insert diety or otherwise here) original post.   Over the weekend I picked up the  urlLink Upright Citizen's Brigade   urlLink Complete First Season DVD  and all I have to say is man oh man, is those dogs hung! Seriously, If you only get one DVD this month (because, who the hell only buys one a year!?)... get the conclusion to  urlLink Onegai Teacher  because, honestly, you have to find out how it ends and if you don't get it right now you're just going to get more agrivated. But next month... Ok, next month get the conclusion to  urlLink RahXephon  because you have to see the end of this one too. Especially with all of the fucked up shit in the last two discs. Then... oh, fuck it, who the hell only buys one DVD a month anyway!?  Sweet Fucking Christ People!!!   Ok, I've calmed down now. Seriously though, if you're a fan of sketch comedy, you should have this DVD. Oh man, there's no way I could go through all of my favorite segments in one post... ok, maybe I could, but I don't have that kind of time right now. Some of the highest highlights are (oh yeah, there are some spoilers, so don't read if you don't want to know):  -  urlLink Little Donny , the boy with magnimus- obliviophallocytis... he has a cock that puts some horses to shame and doesn't realize it. - The lost tapes of Einstein while formulating the theory of relativity, and trying to ease up on the chronic masturbation - The Satanist Cyborg vs. the Christian Cyborg - Andy Richter as Hansel in the story of how Hansel and Gretal really took care of that damned witch - Ass Penneys - The Hot Chicks Room - I learned what "Red Wings" means (thank you for that lovely image Amy Poehler of Saturday Night Live)  That last bit is from one of the audio commentaries which definately make for some of the best features on this DVD (especially if you want to learn about how the president of  urlLink Comedy Central , the company that now owns Viacom, is a major player in domestic heroine distribution). They also have a live Q & A which is mostly crap questions, but makes for a good time for the UCB to make shit up. I mean, there are a lot of really good parts (such as when one of Adair's characters fucks his computer through  The Hole in the Sheet ... "Because [he] can!") and I honestly can't mention them all here.  Seriously, I bought this on Friday and have already watched all of the episodes twice (and most of the commentaries twice as well). One of the most clever concepts with this show is the ability to wrap up most all of the sketches in each episode in one final  climax . (I'm really looking forward to a later season episode where one of the characters had been transformed into a sandwich and is re-birthed into human existance in a massive orgy). I really don't know what else to say except that this is a great (and fairly cheap, you can find it  urlLink elsewhere  for a much lower price, I linked to this one because you get a free T-shirt) set which I know I will continue to watch over and over again. I'm also really looking forward to the future seasons (alas, there are only two more) which have some of my other favorites, such as  urlLink Thunderball , "You Must Chug It!", and City Hall (which is kind of like the cover of that one Boston Album).

      Ok after getting the link from  urlLink Jay , I put in a section of links to people that have linked to me and that I like reading... (I'll add more in a little bit). The thing is, I have no clue how to check what blogs have linked to mine and now that I have this section, I don't want to slight anyone. Basically this post is simply to ask the  urlLink H-Dogg  how the hell to do this because he obviously knows. I hate that he's like Nostradamus and could predict that we would soon not be talking and just communicating via 'blog. Damn him! Oh yeah, this isn't to say that anyone else who knows how to do this is not invited to comment. In fact, that would be a welcome suprise.

      So apparently Jay over at  urlLink Marcellus Wallace's Bloody Gitch  liked enough of my shit (what little of it there is to read so far) that he liked to my page today. First of all, I'd like to thank him for the mad props. I've been reading his stuff off and on since  urlLink BLM  first posted a link to his page and I really enjoy the content.   So now I feel like a hack, having not written anything of real merit (or an attempt at real merit) for the past... while. And now I have a link from someone I've enjoyed in the past (that I don't know personally). So I'm going to try to step it up (I'll probably fail) and write at least a little more each week. But let this be a lesson to all of you out there who think sleeping with  urlLink someone famous  can't get you any recognition from other sources. Granted, I was young and impressionable at the time, but he was very tender and caring... and he has a  HUGE  cock.

      So, as everyone can see, I've done fucking stellar at staying on the ball and updating this blog daily. Look at all the wonderful posts! Oh man, how great am I? I'm a damn loser who can't stick to a plan that's what I am. I would write the rest of what I was planning on writing about Cracker and that experience, but I'm really not inspired to at the moment. You know what, fuck you, if you want to know what it's like to hang out on the tour bus and backstage, help a band out yourself and get off my fucking back.  Sorry, maybe I'll write about Cracker some more later. Right now, I'd like to talk about something more pressing...  The Wind . I hate the fucking wind. The wind is my arch nemesis.  The other day, I'm trying to sleep and it's daytime because I work nights most of the time. All of the sudden hear this beating against my window. I'm thinking that something's going to crash through and then I realize... it's not anything soilid beating against the window, it's just the wind itself. Found out later that it was blowing at over 80-mph. This kept me awake for 3 days straight so I was nothing but tired and this is what happens any time it gets windy. I mean, normally, I'm a  heavy  sleeper. If I can sleep through my wife getting up and getting ready for work, then leaving in the morning, I should be able to sleep through anything. Not the wind. No sir, that fucking beast keeps me up no matter what!  So I've been thinking about it lately and I'd do a decent amount of ill shit to get rid of the wind. I mean, I wouldn't hurt anyone I care about or anything like that, but I think I'd go pretty far. I mean, the other day I was thinking: You know, if Osama Bin Laden were able to stop the wind, I wouldn't think he's that bad a guy anymore. I might even consider electing him president. I imagine the conversation would go something like this:   Elijah the Prophet:  You see Osama's running for president?   Sane Individual:  Yeah man, that's fucked up! What does that bastard think he's doing? He organized the killing of thousands of innocent Americans and now he wants to be our leader? Fuck that. Fuck that!   ETP:  I don't know, I'm considering voting for him.   SI:  Are you fucking nuts? The man hates everything about our country. Women would be terribly oppressed under his rule, there would be no more free elections, there would be the threat of torture and death to everyone that opposes him, everyone would be forced to convert to Islam and worst of all, there would be no more access to pornography.  No Porn!    ETP:  Yeah, life would suck and the man is a murderer. But did you see what he did about the wind?  Ok, realistically, I wouldn't go that far, but I think I've made my point.

       Cracker Weekend Part 1   So  THAT  was a good weekend. There were a few lame parts. On the way home Friday night my wife's car broke down and I had to have it towed to the dealership the next morning on practically no sleep. I also broke with my goal to update at least once a day... and so soon too. I would be disappointed with myself except for the fact that I was damn busy this weekend. Now I'd appreciate it if you got off my back about it.  So this weekend was mostly about  urlLink Cracker  who continues to play a rock show like none other. The thing is they're all about the music as opposed to the show. Now from time to time I do enjoy a band that concentrates on putting together a show (lots of audience participation and side antics to go with the music) a la  urlLink They Might Be Giants  or  urlLink Barenaked Ladies  (I say this full well knowing how badly  Maroon  sucked, although I haven't listened to the new disc yet). However, most of the time I appreciate a band that concentrates on the songs themselves more.   A truely good band of musicians can get the audience into the show by simply playing and that's what Cracker is able to do. It was a little difficult to get some of the audience members involved at these particular shows because some were there for  Cowboy Mouth . Now, not all, but some of the  Cowboy Mouth  fans were unwilling to give Cracker a fair shake. Made my job of signing people up for the Cracker e-mail list that much harder. Most of the time at other shows I've worked I'll get a polite rejection when people don't want to sign up for the list. But not these fucking  Cowboy Mouth  fans. They were rude as hell: "Nope, here for  Cowboy Mouth ." Fuck you too asshole!   With Cracker being on first at these shows, they did win some converts that I was able to get between acts which was great. But the underlying probelem with the other fans of  Cowboy Mouth  (the jack-offs) became evident to me when the band went on stage. The cult atmosphere kind of shocked me. At one point someone summed it up with something to the effect of "I wonder if these guys all drink Kool-Aid after the show." (referring to the Jonestown Cult Massacre of the late 1970s... as I explain the joke, once again. Fuck!) They were commanding the audience to do all sorts of things: jump around like two-year olds and scream, hug and kiss your neighbor, etc. Look, I don't like most of the people I know, let alone this automaton drooling next to me, I'm not fucking touching that guy.  The oither thing that rubbed me wrong was that all of  Cowboy Mouth's  antics seemed too contrived and forced, almost scripted (this was affirmed while seeing them the second night when almost everything was repeated word for word to this audience). They also seem to serious about their carefree attitude. There's not much self-mockery. There are attempts such as when their frontman talks about how much of a dumbass he is on stage, but it feels like he's just saying it as he believes that he's a  Golden God  ( Almost Famous  reference... Fuck!). The best way I can describe  Cowboy Mouth  is that they're like  urlLink Tenacious D  if Tenacious D had none of the qualities that make Tenacious D Tenacious D. Another Cracker fan's opinion was that of, "This band is terrible! These guys fucking suck!"  Dammit, I just got a call about my wife's car so I have to go pick that up now. And all I've gotten to talk about is the bad aspects and the other band! Well, I guess I'll be back later with the story of how good my weekend was in my next post.

      So I got the call from Frank this afternoon, looks like we are once again going to help collect e-mail addresses for the  urlLink Cracker  mailing list. Fucking sweet! I really like the fact that I get to help out in promoting my favorite band (the added bonus of getting into the show free and hanging out with them afterwards is nice too). It's also really cool when you  get a phone call from the drummer and you already know him (kind of).  I'll never forget the first time I got my calling (not from that God dickhead, from Frank). I was working nights at the time and the call wakes me up.     I answer the phone:  Hello?    Frank:  Yeah, this is Frank from Cracker.   ETP:  Oh hey, how's it going?   Frank:  Did you just wake up!?   ETP:  Well, I work nights.   Frank:  Ok, I can understand that.   ETP:  Yeah, I'm not just one of those shitless lay-abouts.  From there he asked me if I wanted to help and so on. He's a really down to earth guy and it was just really nice to be able to talk to someone I admire as a real person. Well, that's all I have time for now because I have to get there before doors. I assume I'll be ranting with Cracker filled goodness for the next few posts so look forward to it... woo-hoo.

      Alright, so now I've got everything basic that I wanted to get up on this site: E-mail, Guestbook, Site Meter, Comments, Monkey Fucking a Coconut, etc. Ok, still need to find an MFC but that will have to wait as I've already wasted so much time already. So now my goal is to get in at least one decent post a day, that way this site won't go by the way side. So if anyone besides the standard crew begins to read this on a regular basis, and notices that I've gotten lazy about posting, tell me to wake my sorry-ass up and get back to work! (Not that I don't want "The Posse" to do this as well, but they will no matter what.)   Peace, love and recycle. (Does anyone remember what idiot used to say that. I'm a showboatin' lib, but goddamn that sounds like a bunch of pussy, hippy nonsense.)

      So many of you, or the one or two people who have seen this, are probably wondering, " 'Elijah the Prophet,' what is with your clever but obscure title? Please enlighten me." (Ok, I know that this isn't true for the one or two who have been here because, let's face it, I know you and you either know the origin or I just explained it to you.) Well, my fine feathered friends, here's your explanation. For a few years on  urlLink Comedy Central  they ran a show called  urlLink Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist  (Wow, I just found that they sell copies of Dr. Katz on Amazon, it's VHS, but that's still cool. Did I know this already?) and in one episode, Dr. Katz tells a joke to a friend at which the friend does not laugh. As Dr. Katz begins to explain, his friend interrupts with "You can't do that, because if you try to explain the joke, life's just not worth living."  Well, I've been thinking about this a lot lately as I tend to find myself in these situations where jokes are not being understood. And it';s not because they're lame jokes, these are damn funny. Most recently, some friends and I went to see  urlLink  Kill Bill   which was a great movie. I mean the sheer absurdity of the fight scenes throughout were mind boggling. It was hilarious. But alas, we were the only ones in the theater laughing (almost falling over at points). I don't know if everyone else has just lost their funnybone (that sounds retarded) or what happened. Is it the, "It's a Tarentino film and he does art house pictures, this must mean something" syndrome? WTF? I really felt the urge to just explain to everyone why this is a good movie because they obviously did not get it.  Another time this happened that sticks out in my head was a few years back at a  urlLink Cracker  show. By the way, Cracker is easily my favorite band and if you haven't seen them live, you should do that. They're in Boulder, CO tomorrow and Denver, CO on Saturday. Ok, enough promotion (for now). So I'm standing next to this unwashed, unshaven, slob of a guy, you know, the epitome of the youth of America. We're talking about the band, and he asks my favorite song. I reply with  The Gentleman's Blues  and he says he loves  Euro-Trash Girl . The conversation from there:   Elijah the Prophet:  That is a classic, and it's fucking funny!   Moron (I'm sure this had to be what his parents named him):  What do you mean?   ETP:  It's great, I love the line:  Sold my plasma in Amsterdam. Spent it all in a night, buying drinks at the Melk Weg for a soldier in drag.     SFB (Shit for Brains):  Why's that funny?   ETP:  Can you imagine, selling blood to get money to go to the bars, hitting on a pretty girl all night then finding out she's not only a man, but a gun wielding one at that? Classic.   TSMITU (The Sharpest Man In The Universe):  I don't think that's funny, I'd probably punch the guy.  That's when I moseyed away from the swill guzzling simian (Dick!).  So what does this mean? Well I guess I should have learned my lesson at the Cracker show. I mean, people are morons and if they don't get it, fuck them! But there's the other part of me that thinks society should be better than this. We  should  have a sense of humor! Not only that we should think about things as opposed to just taking things in and doing nothing with the information (humorous or otherwise). I don't know. I've found that when people are forced to think, they do come up with reasonable ideas. A lot of them just seem to need guidance.   And really, I'm not of the mind set that you have to think like me for your ideas to have merit. A prime example of this is that I enjoy listening to  urlLink Doug Kellett . His conservative views are, for the most part, opposed to mine in most ways, but he shows that he has a thought process and he's smart, so I respect him and enjoy his show.   But back to my previous point, I think that this country just needs to be taught how to think (as opposed to what to believe, there is no thought process in belief). I don't know what more to say than that.  Well, this piece has certainly degenerated. But as long as people don't think about the world around them, in all senses, I guess that I'm doomed to be one of the ones explaining the joke... fuck!

      Alright, so I'm here at work now. First think I did was ask  urlLink John  for help on editing my menu bar. In other words, I haven't been very productive tonight... yet. So the next thing to do is sit around and wait to see how long it takes Humbert Humbert, or whatever he's calling himself this week, over at  urlLink Fuck Everything   to find my site now that I've linked to him. That kid has mad motherfuckin' blogging skills and I expect him to find this place wit' da quickness. Who knows though, I happen to know that the  urlLink Fe  offices are in the process of a move so he might be packing and not find me for a couple of hours. We'll see.

      So I got back from running and I feel pretty good. My shins hurt slightly, but not too bad as I try to keep to the dirt and grass while I'm running. This supposedly supplies the legs with more cushioning and is less hard on the joints. Yeah, you know that you care. So while I was out I wasn't really hit by inspiration to write about anything in particular. When I got back, I was right about the stink factor of my nuts. Just a little something for you.  Instead of listening to KMFDM when I went out I popped in the "Fountains of Wayne" eponymous debut disc into my MiniDiscman and went out to that. It's been a while since I've heard anything by them other than "Stacy's Mom" and I felt like some of the classics today. I did get to thinking about the fact that I never purchased the actual CD for myself on this one which made me feel bad for two reasons. First of all, I really like Fountains of Wayne and they're a band with a small fan base. Basically, they actually are hurt by people not purchasing their discs unlike fucking Dr. Dre, Metallica and  urlLink Kid Rock .  Secondly, the CD itself has one of my  urlLink favorite album covers of all time . I mean seriously, I want a picture of me when I was little, dressed as a superhero (complete with underwear outside of my pants and a towel cape) and saving one of my stuffed animals. That's cool as hell (not hella-cool because people who say hella are sub-morons). If I could find a poster of this album cover I'd be pleased as punch. So yeah, my main point is that I need to pick up a copy of this disc.  That was somewhat long for being uninspired.  Also, I figured out how to change my posting name so I am now Elijah the Prophet. You see, I always thought that I should cut a techno album and that would be my DJ name. Now there's just that pesky point of having to learn to DJ.  You know what, I just explained the joke... fuck!

      Ah, my new blog... finally. I've been bullshitting around for the past few months with all the people that I know who are already blogging. "Yeah guys, I'm gonna start my own blog sometime soon. Just watch me. No, really. Hey, where's everyone going?" Yup. That's about how it's gone. This might have something to do with the fact that most people who know me, know that I follow through on my ideas at the standard rate of 7% of the time.  But that's about the same for all guys so fuck you for judging me.   Anyway, I'm now trying to decide what insightful, witty commentary to include in my first post, but really, I'm just drawing a blank. Fuck! Oh well, I'm going for a run, then maybe my thoughts will be more collected. Ok, probably not. Realistically, the only things that I'll be thinking after running  are "KMFDM SUCKS" and goddamn my nut sweat stinks!  And how the hell do I post not as Elijah!?

      So I'm taking a short break from work (which is starting to become busy and looks as if it will really pick up in the next couple of weeks) to post a link to the webcomic  urlLink Combustible Orange  which I found through  urlLink moviepoopshoot.com  because the character  urlLink Action Datsun  is the star of a comic over there that I found funny. I've been reading the Combustible Orange comic while waiting for simulations to run and I'm finding it fucking hilarious. Besides, you can't go wrong with a character like  urlLink Super Demolition Christ .

       FUCKING PEOPLE!!!   So I have this "co-worker", we'll call him  That Fucking Asshole Cocksucking Dickhead (Not to Mention Ashamed Closet Homosexual) Dave  for Short. I put co-worker in quotes because, well, he's not actually a co-worker as he's not an employee of the company. He's one of our contract workers currently acting as our "Analytical Chemist." I put Analytical Chemist in quotes because the fucking moron doesn't know dick about analytical chemistry (yet, he has a PhD in the subject which just goes to show you that the value of an education can be equivalent to a "Hot Cup of Jack Squat!" at times)!  My disgust at this poor excuse for an employee can be traced back to his entrance into my company but I'll start you a little later than that...   This past spring, the company that I am currently employed with was going through some financial problems and as such I was made to lay off all of the contract people under myself. Now this fucking sucked! Sure a couple of them needed to go as they weren't working out very well, but I also had to lay off a few people that were quality workers, some of whom I had become friends with. So all contractors are gone... but not Dave (nor myself, as I was contract at the time, but I actually do work dammit... granted, I'm blogging right now but...  Fuck You for Judging Me! )  Anyway, the next step was to staff all of our operation necessities internally. So the deal was that I relegated myself and Dave to the night shift as  everyone  else in the company had seniority over the two of us. Now, during the two weeks we were together on nights, I had been having a conflict with another co-worker over some procedural issues that aren't worth getting into. Dave takes it upon himself to talk with me about how I should be gentler in the handling of the situation so as not to cause strife within the company. "For the Good of the Company" is his reasoning.  A week later he tells to our boss he can't work nights anymore because it conflicts with his personal schedule...  FUCKING DICK!  He fucking gets away with it too! I would have said, "You can't work nights... bye." When you're on contract you can't make demands like that (at least you shouldn't be able to). I know, because I've been layed off as a contractor before. Your job is never secure so you take what you can get. Arrgghh!  Also, Dave is single (and a suspected closet-queer) and has no life that I can discern except he stays her on Fridays until midnight sometimes to work on his motorcycle. I, on the other hand, am married and have friends that like to go out for drinks during the week after work... and his social life is affected?  So, because of his refusal to work, we hire one of our former contract employees back. Now, I am glad we did, because he's a good worker and a friend. But the point is, Dave, a bastard who, less than a week earlier was talking to me about what's "Good for the Company," is now costing the company more money by refusing to work a night shift! Fucking hypocritical dick (did I mention he's a devout Christian, maybe that's where the hypocrisy came from).  So flash forward to tonight (ignoring all of the other shit: milking the company for overtime every week, spending our money on shit he doesn't need just to look like he's doing something, doing  nothing  most of the time he's at work but talking to vendors all day, etc.). I had sent out an e-mail that stated that we would be stripping and waxing the floors for all of the offices in the lab (where Dave's, as well as mine, are located). He comes back with the following response:   While I appreciate your cleaning and waxing the floors ....  Since this is affecting the work of others, wouldn't it make sense to check with them to see if it is OK before planning to do it ?   While this is a "down" week on the schedule for the reactors, I have plenty of work to do involving the lab and my office.  I don't want to empty out my office completely just to have the floors done.   I'd rather leave the floor as is or just do the "traffic areas".  If this is going to take 2 days to do and will tie up the lab and control room, could it be done on a weekend so as not to disturb the work of others.   You know what...  fuck you . This is something that needs to be done, and this is a good time to do it because it's right before New Year's vacation which will give the wax time to dry after it's applied. And the other thing is, if I asked everyone when would be a good time, it would never get done. And The Other Thing Is, you don't get to decide if your office needs waxing or not because, as you are not an employee, you do not have to deal with the long-term consequences. AND THE OTHER THING IS, if you're so keen for weekend work, maybe you should do your shit over the weekend.  AND THE OTHER THING IS, YOU DON'T FUCKING DO ANY WORK HERE ANYWAY!!!   The main thing that pisses me of is it all comes down to Dave looking out for his hours. That's the truth of the matter. He just wants hours to guarantee he gets paid. Well, other contractors aren't guaranteed shit, and he shouldn't be either. You know, it would piss me off so much that he's just looking out for number one, if he didn't try to manufacture the appearance that he gives a shit about anything else. I have no conclusion to this story at the moment so I will simply grumble as I shuffle off begrudgingly.

      So over at  urlLink Fe  I found this  urlLink link  and I've got to say, I'm fucking addicted. This Natalia is one screwed up Russian girl and I'll be damned if that doesn't make for a good read. (BTW, I mean screwed up in the best way possible, I mean, look at the people I hang out with.) I actually went back and read all of the posts on this blog within two days of first checking it out. I'm not sure what it is (maybe the reflection on college, maybe the fact that I find it refreshing to hear a woman talk about the guys she'd really like to fuck), but I really foud it an enjoyable, and highly addictive read. Ok, I'm going to shut up now so you can take the time to look at it for yourself.

       Man, I am an Updating Machine   I mean, isn't it amazing that I've had between 5 and 10 updates everyday for the past week and a half. Where do I find the time to write almost continuously, not to mention the skill to update with such eloquence. I mean, I don't mean to sound pretentious or anything, but I'm really fucking good.  Alright, now that that faux, self-aggrandizing is out of the way, I actually do have a real update.  So for the past year or so I've become addicted to talk radio. I especially enjoy  urlLink this station  because they actually do have hosts on both side of the spectrum. Most of them are even willing to listen to the other side when good points are presented and only a few hang up on callers when there is disagreement. If you live in Colorado, give it a try and if not, give the webcast a listen if you are so inclined. Greg Dobbs and Doug Kellett are my personal choices (a liberal and a conservative, respectively, if you care to label).  I must be a glutton for punishment though, because my addiction has mandated that I also listen to the ultra-conservative talk show hosts as well, which tends to lead to my screaming at the top of my lungs whenever the asinine bullshit starts to spew forth. I'm sorry, but Christians have no right to be complaining about discrimination, much like white people, ok O'Reilly.   Last Friday, my drive home after a night of work listening to  America at Night  and my drive back later that afternoon listening to  urlLink  The Radio Factor   both yielded whining about  urlLink this subject . I mean, nothing pisses me off more than the way these  Radio Talk Show Hosts , people who get paid to exercise their first amendment rights, want to whittle away the first amendment rights of people with views contrary to theirs. BTW, this was before the SS got involved just in case you were wondering.  Now, I can understand the limits on free speech so as not to endanger the lives of others (disallowing yelling "Fire!" in a theater makes sense to me... even though that could be a fun way to weed out some stupid motherfuckers). I even understand the principle behind it being illegal to say "I'm going to kill the president." I mean, this is a threat against the head of our body of government and the Secret Service doesn't have the time to investigate who's joking and who's serious. I get that.   But the thing is, in his song, Eminem didn't  threaten  the life of George W. All that he said was that he'd like to see the president dead (the line from the article that says, "The reference to seeing the president dead does not specify the president of the United States" is bullshit however, we know what this Marshall Mathers kid meant). I'm sure a lot of the public dissatisfied with Dubya' would like to see him dead and has espoused this before. (I'm not with this camp, I don't want to Cheney in power and Bush martyred, as would be the result, see  urlLink Fe ) So why can't Eminem, espouse the same view publicly?  Well, these Hosts' complaints were along the lines that because he is famous and has a large, dedicated following, one of his fans may take this as a call to arms and actually attempt the assassination. The  America at Night  host actually declared that this was Slim Shady's intention. (See how I've referred to Eminem by all three of his monikers... I'm such a fucking jack-off). Sorry guys, even if some fan did take the lyric this way and attempt an assassination, Eminem's no more culpable than  urlLink Pac-Man  when some video game nut loses it and guns down three kids dressed as Pinky, Blinky and Inky for Halloween. As our yellow hero says, "That kid was fucked up when I met him." And you'd have to be too, to kill  anyone  because Eminem told you to.  This brings me to the next point that O'Reilly and friends brought up. That we need to stop this type of free speech so that our children don't get hold of it. I've got a little bit of a different view on this point. You see, I think that maybe we should try a little thing that you may have read about somewhere,  IT"S CALLED PARENTING YOU STUPID FUCKING MORON!!! . When kids are young, parents actually  can , influence their children with respect to their belief system and value system. I know that this is a novel idea, but you might actually be able to see this in households where parents don't use the TV as a babysitter and just ignore their kids because they just had them "to get it over with." That's how you're going to end up with kids that would kill the president because "Eminem told me too." They're going to pay attention to the person that raised them and, if they watch nothing but MTV 24/7, who do you think raised them?  I grew up in a household where both of my parents dedicated a lot of time to raising me. They helped develop the values I have today and gave me the skills to make judgments, not based on rhetoric, but logic. When I was a kid, they regulated what I saw based on their values, and as I grew, they started letting me make the decisions and lo and behold, I kept a lot of their values. Yes, I did get hold of some things, as a teenager, that at least my mother wouldn't approve of (see  urlLink Adam Sandler's  first CD) but because of their parenting I know that while beating the shit out of a Spanish teacher, in theory, is funny, in reality it may be funny, but I shouldn't do it.  I guess my point is that if you parent, you can dictate what your kids see and hear and value. Yes, some stuff they may want that you don't want them to have, and they may hear some of it from friends (I always knew where to go to watch  Child's Play  despite my parents' anti-gore flick stance). But the fact that you are paying attention  is  going to have a positive and stabilizing effect. So if you don't want your children to have access to something, do your best to limit it and explain your views to them, it does work.  Finally, the last point that these hosts made was that there should be a Boycott of any store that sells Eminem CDs. Good idea. If you agree that Eminem is a foul-mouth, antichrist, boycott. If you want to tell him that declaring that he wants the president dead is wrong, boycott.  But protesting is  all  you can do. This isn't illegal and it sure as hell shouldn't be! In addition, here's an idea: get off the "liberals'" backs for protesting against things that they don't like if you're calling for the same thing. It looks a little less hypocritical.  Ok, I've run out of steam now, but I wanted to end it with this thought. Marshall Mathers is brilliant. Dumb as rocks in some ways, but still brilliant (or he could be like Bush and the people he surrounds himself with are brilliant). This song is supposedly from a (possibly forthcoming) EP entitled "Straight from the Lab." Now record companies, traditionally don't promote EPs as the major cash isn't made in that arena. So how do you get publicity for an un promoted album? Maybe, leak a controversial track and let the conservative assholes that are pissed off promote it for you. Sounds like a good idea to me to. In fact, I put the ETP guarantee on the fact that if this ever comes out, the sales will go through the roof in part thanks to the religious right. I reinforce this fact by stating that, even with all of my musical wisdom, I wasn't aware of this until Friday, but now I plan on buying a copy (in addition to getting the downloads available).

      So yesterday morning, during my drive to work (which lasted two hours, because it snowed on Sunday and apparently Colorado  residents have never seen  snow  before. Ok, it was pretty icy but still.) I was listening to the radio and what I heard made me laugh, once again, at the pathetic state of humanity.  Apparently, the winter X-Games were postponed yesterday (or Sunday, I can't remember which). Now this alone makes me happy because, fuck the X-Games.  "Hey look, I'm dangerous, I can do tricks on my snowmobile. Look at me! Whee!"  Fuck you buddy. If you want to play a truely dangerous sport try your hand at Shark Rodeo, South American Train Surfing or  urlLink Thunderball .  But here's what legitimizes my claim that the pansys have no balls. The Winter X-Games were postponed because of... 3 inches of snow. Excuse me. Wait, wait, you want me to think you're a bad motherfucker, cause you can do some stupid ass flip on your snowboard (or your POS of choice), but you have to stop and come inside for hot chocolate and cookies when it starts snowing? That's extreme... -ly fucking sad. Look, I make a motion that everyone stop watching this shit until these guys either a) remove any notion of thew concept of "extreme" from this weak shit henceforth known as the _-Games or b) somebody gets ground up in the tread of his snowmobile during blizard conditions with his mother watching. Now that's extreme motherfucker! (Besides, I'd really like to see these fucks in a bloodbath highlight on sportscenter)

      So every once in awhile... alright, all the time, I get these stupid little questions running through my head that I feel the need to find the answer to. Just the other day, my wife found a prospective new job working for a guy with the last name of Boone. My first response is, "Does he wear a coonskin cap everywhere? If my last name were Boone, I'd wear a coonskin cap and carry an old-school shotgun everywhere." This is my response because I'm stupid.  But here's where I get locked in thought. I jump from this to, "You know, I've never met or heard of anyone with the last name of Hitler. Where did all the Hitler's go? I mean it's a last name so there have to be Hitlers somewhere, right?" It is then pointed out (which I do already know, I'm just being retarded) that all of the Hitlers probably changed their last name due to the fact that... Hitler tends to be frowned upon, especially in Germany and the rest of Europe, where the name originated.  I know that this is probably the case, but I keep thinking, there had to be someone with the balls to keep the last name of Hitler. Because of this I've been scanning the phone books every once in awhile for the last few days looking for "Joe Hitler." He's got to be somewhere. I probably wouldn't want to meet him though, anyone with the balls to keep the name Hitler is probably some white-supremacist fuck anyway.

      Alright, I was out in downtown Denver tonight for St. Patrick's Day and I've got some shit to talk about:  First off, why the fuck does everyone love Britney Spears for the mere fact that she's Britney Spears (read: everyone fucking stupid). See, we're at this little bar/club tonight (I can't remember and I'm a racist asshole so they all look the same to me anyway) and my friend Karla, my wife and I are all having a good time dancing to the stuff they're playing. We're having a good time and the floor's only about half full so we've got some good dancing space. (I actually enjoy dancing, I don't really have any moves per say, but I can keep rhythm and, unlike most white guys, I know that the whole body has to be involved. Most of these rich, white, frat fucks think it's enough to bob the head and move the arms, meanwhile having their feet cemented to the floor. This is the opposite of that Riverdance shit where people are stone cold down to the ankles where they become a bubbling pot of Gaelic sex.)   Anyway, we're having a good time out there and out of nowhere that new fucking Britney song,  Toxic  pops on. Now I don't know if you people have heard thi piece of shit (I only know it because of  urlLink Natalia's  'blog and because I caught the video one morning on the bootleg  M2  that we get on local channel 55 as we have no cable) but the production work sounds like a cat being slaughtered on top of a muskrat such that the cat is put out of its misery as the muskrat is left alive and screaming at the end of the ordeal. If some of you didn't pick that up, I'm not a fan. Now I'm a fair judge... hell, I even liked the song  Boys  (featuring Pharell Williams) and I can admit that. (Though mostly the enjoyment of  Boys  has to do with the fact that it was Neptunes produced and the Neptunes could probably re-mix a fart and I'd enjoy it), But this new song, even the video sucks! Usually you get to see Britney looking good, but in this one she looks like shit for most of it, except for when she's in the mostly nude thing, but there's no tits or bush so what's the point.  So back to my rant... this fucking song comes on and, all of the sudden, the floor is packed... with stupid white girls that have no idea how to dress for their body type! It's a fucking travesty I tell you. Everyone gets up for a crappy song and does their crappy dance for a fucking name! Jesus P. Christ, the public sucks.  Ok, the other thing tonight. I was downtown and I looked across the stree to where Hooter's should have been... AND IT"S FUCKING GONE. Let me state that again so that the gravity is perceived...    THE HOOTER"S IN DOWNTOWN DENVER IS FUCKING DEAD!   Just like Julie Dwyer in the fucking pool. Well, now I really know how bad the economy in Colorado is. If a place in LoDo, based solely on the sale of sex and sports, closes down... we're fucT with a capital T. Now, I was never a big fan because, the Hooter's girls were stuck up bitches (I understand though, if I were in their position, I'd be a stuck up bitch too), but my wife,  urlLink  BLM  and I went there every once in awhile because, we actually really like the wings there (despite the fact that two will kill you instantly).  So that's about all for now. I'm still a little buzzed so if there are any mistakes in this post, get off my back about it. Oh yeah, I think that I really need to start going out downtown every once in awhile because, there's really so much to bitch about down there.

Well I came across this rare little entry and felt the need to share it:   I cant be friends with women, all i think about is their mouth around my cock, i wanna do every girl, even ugly ones, i love fucking women, and i like fucking my friends, i wanna find a nympho   Now, I've never run into anything like this before and I'm only going by what I've heard in rumors, but I think this person's problem is, stay with me here, he's a guy.

      So I was watching Kimmel tonight and  urlLink David Cross  was there. That was good. Truthfully, I don't really remem ber much of what they talked about besides Kathy Griffin talking about how pissed of she was that Jimmy Kimmel didn't go to her Christmas (?) party and how the last time David Cross was there he wore a green pimp coat (there was a really good picture to go with the story).  Anyway, I guess that Cross is in this  Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind  movie which sounds more interesting every time I see/hear/read something about it. I think that I'll probably go see it (despite the fact that, no matter how hard he tries, Jim Carrey will never win an Oscar... Good, Fuck Him!) as very few movies in the theater have intrigued me lately.  So the main point of this post is that also revealed during this interview was that David Cross has a new stand-up disc coming out in May which he described as picking up where the last ( Shut Up you Fucking Baby ) left off with more swearing. That's fucking great!

      So this past weekend they were having a sale on various anime soundtracks at Media Play (I think that they still are) and I had a $15 Replay Certificate (i.e. they've gouged me for a fuckload of cash... enough so that they'll give me fifteen bucks for free... woo hoo) so I went out and picked up the  urlLink FLCL  soundtrack which was a damn good purchase. The majority of the album is by the Japanese group  urlLink The Pillows . A group I can best describe as a  Japanese '90s Brit/Garage Rock Band . I shit you not. When I first heard these guys, the overwhelming thought was "Dude, these guys are the Japanese  urlLink Blur ." In my opinion this is a damn good thing. I should qualify though, I'm talking Blur during the days of their eponymous release and  13 , I wouldn't put these guys in  Parklife  and before territory (which is still damn good stuff, I'm not knocking it).  Anyway, a decent amount of stuff on this disc sounds like Blur and the not shitty Oasis stuff (some reminiscent of  Definitely Maybe ). Some of the highlights on this disc are  Hybrid Rainbow  during which, even not being able to speak Japanese, I can just feel the pain, lonliness and rejection belting out of vocalist Sawao Yamanaka's pipes;  One Life  which leads me to the Oasis comparison as it sounds like a Japanese Band covering an Oasis cover of a Beatles song written entirely in Japanese (which despite the round-about comparison makes for a great track);  Ride On Shooting Star  containing the line "Revenge no lobster hikitsurete" which apparently translates to "Accompanied by a lobster of revenge"; and the album closer  Little Busters  which encapsulates children growing up, the major theme of the series. There are also a slew of instrumntal tracks of which my favorites are  Stalker  and  Stalker Goes to Babylon , which sound like something off of the  Fight Club  score,  Beautiful Morning With You , which has a kick-ass change in tempo midway through, and  Bran-new Lovesong  which has a Super Furry Animals feel to it.  So yeah, overall, I highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone that likes '90s Brit/Garage Rock that they can't understand. It's been in my player most of the time since I got it on Saturday so that's saying something (not sure what). It also inspired me to re-watch the show, which I think is just a really good interpretation of the feelings that are involved in growing up, going through puberty, loss of innocence (read: virginity), a first failed relationship (and the rejection associated with it), and moving on with life. There are a lot of other things going on in the show (sibling rivalry, definitely) but these were the majors I got out of it. Also, I just love the overt sexual imagry... because I'm a pervert.

      The lord hath risen!  So I dug out my TI-G.O.D (TI-92 a.k.a. big fucking calculator capable of world domination) today and ressurected it. You see, when we had last left our hero, a few AA batteries had been in ther too long and were dripping a little acid. At the time, I was in the middle of a move and had no/could not find any replacement batteries. So he was banished to the closet until further notice.  Anyway, today I popped it opened and replaced both sets of batteries and much like the mythical Jesus Fucking Christ, he was back in action, all weapons operational. It's a good thing too, because I'm a big dork and I sunk some money into this thing.  urlLink BLM  and I bought the upgrade TI-92 Plus Module when it came out and even got the connector cable so that we could download software for our savior from the internet.  Which brings me to the point of this post. I need to remember to ask BLM for the cable because I need to lower my self esteem and get some software. Besides, with the money I put into this thing, I  know  that there's got to be some software out ther so it will do my laundry.

      Hey cool. How great is it that we get to relive the old days of  urlLink separate but equal  but in a hip, new, updated way? I mean, hatred and descrimination of blacks is so passe now anyway. New target: Queers. All right!  I mean seriously, how much bullshit is this. "Um yeah, we don't want them to be able to be legally married, but they can have all of those same rights if we call it something different." Fucking moron. Remember when words meant something. (Remember when using quotation marks meant that we were actually quoting someone real and not just some dipshit in our heads.) That aside, what the fuck is wrong with us?   It really does seem to hark back to segregation in the South. The main difference being, that back then the whites didn't what to have to even look at the blacks and the separate but equal policy achieved that. In addition, they could make the black facilities sub-standard. What is differentiating between "marriage" and "civil unions" even doing? Absolutely goddamn nothing... except distinguishing homosexual couples as second class. They get all of the rights, but can't be "married," that's reserved for  this  (non-sinner) class of citizens.  Jesus P. Christ I hate this place.

      Seriously though, this film, "The Passion of the Christ" really bothers me. Now, before I go any further, I want to put it out there that no, I have not seen it. Because of that, I'm not going to criticize the film itself.  What I can criticize is the marketing of religion, which has bothered me for a damn long time. Now, I'm not religious at all. Truthfully, I think of myself as an apathist, I really just don't care. Sure, I wouldn't mind knowing more about the afterlife (if there is one), but it's not a central concern in my day to day life, because it doesn't need to be. The way I figure, I'm alive right now so I'll work on the whole life thing, I'll find out more about death someday... hey, I know, maybe when I'm dead.  This is one of the central things that bothers me about Christianity. According to it, I have to know that Jesus is my Savior to get into Camp Heaven, if not, I have to go to play with the other losers in Hell. And Hell doesn't have the fancy canoes with the nice paddles. All you get there is half inflated tire and a stick! Tangent. Anyway, I cannot honestly say (and frankly don't see how anyone else can) that without a shadow of a doubt, that some 2000 year old dead guy is getting me into the club. I mean, he didn't show up last week when I was stuck behind the velvet rope, how do I know he's showing up when I die.  Bottom line is, it's unfair. I can't come in because I'm not willing to concede a point that there are no facts to back up. That's bullshit. Especially with the fact that there's a bunch of evidence contrary to the rest of the contents of the bible, like dinosaurs and carbon dating. If scary father figure's test is that I have to kick dirt in the face of logic and say I believe in something with no grounds in reality, then scary father figure is a dick! It's an unfair test!  Which is why I don't believe in that God. I think that there's something greater out there, but I have no clue what. I've always liked the idea of something collective, which is funny now that I think about it, because I hate most of the other people sharing this rock with me... oh well, I bet the monkeys are cool.  urlLink Saul Williams  always struck a chord with me:   Never question who I am God knows And I know God personally, In fact she let's me call her me   Anyway, now that I've deviated from my initial point entirely... marketing of religion. The epitome of this was when we were watching this religious network one night, and there was this kids Bible trivia game show on. One of the products marketed during the show was Jesus based sneakers (with something like "WWJD", or "Jesus is Lord" embriodered on the side) and they were like fifty bucks. What!? All I could think during the whole thing was, "If Christian theology is correct, everyone involved with this is going to hell."   I don't see much of a difference between that and the Mel Gibson flick. Granted, Mel did it as a labor of love, but the mere fact that he's making money off of it and allowing studio pieces of shit to rake in money off of it, bastardizes it. Period. To me, if Mel truely loves his religion, what he's done is no different than selling his soul.  I do have to say, at some point I do want to see the movie because I'm sure I'll have some criticisms about the content as well, but having not seen it, that's all I've got for now.

      I like Kevin Smith (this is what he says about "Bob Christ's Passion"):  I can't compare it [to 'Dogma',] says Smith. "It looks like Mel Gibson's movie is going to be successful. He has the support of all the people who hated 'Dogma.' Bill Donahue of the Catholic League was so resoundingly adverse to our picture, whereas he's backing Mel on this one, going 'every good Catholic should see this film.'"  Smith emphasized during the interview that he's not seen the film yet, but was basing his opinions on where all the media's attention seemed to be focusing. "[Gibson's] way into fetishizing the death of Christ," says Smith. "I know it's important. It ain't Jesus unless he dies and comes back three days later. But I like my Jesus as the guy who says nice things and imparted very simple platitudes to still hold true today."  Smith also touched on the excessive violence of the film. "I'm not into the whole kind of like 'He died on the cross and he was butchered by the f***ing Romans and the Jews.' I don't know. That's kind of porn, isn't it? Porn for the religious right?"

      Actually, February was pretty busy, hence, no posting. This may also have to do with the fact that I've been a slacker and don't seem to have the dedication to keep up with this. Part of the problem, I think, is that I really have to stop reading other 'blogs. There were a few days last month that I thought, "I'll sit here at my desk and eat lunch, catch up on some other peoples stuff and then maybe I'll 'blog some myself." As we all can see, that worked well.  The thing is, I have been trying to get back into writing on a regular basis ('blog or otherwise) and I do really enjoy it, I just need to make time for it. You see, a couple of months ago, my wife joined  urlLink Wynette's  writer's group, hoping that it would help her get back into the groove in terms of her poetry (and it has, she's getting back to where she's turning out some good stuff again that only needs minor work). Well, as I no longer work nights, and writer's group is held at our house, I seem to have de facto joined (am I using de facto in the right context, I think I am but... who gives a fuck). It reall started a couple of weeks ago when they were doing a writing exercise, I got home and some writing utensits were thrust upon me with the instructions, "Here. Write the fairy tale 'Rumplestiltskin" as you remember it." Of course I threw in a little bit of my own flavor, and what I got through in terms of the story line came out pretty decent. So now I have the urge to write more. Problem is, I have so much shit to do. Really, fucking off at work like I used to be able to do, is no longer an option. Today is a rare exception in that I actually have time to 'blog here at work. But most days, I'm playing the part of a real process engineer (novice, of course, but engineer nonetheless.  But even while working, these lines that I think would be good in a piece go through my head and I'm like, "Yeah, I've got to remember to use that one." The problem is I never do, which is why I need to get my own  urlLink "Fuck Everything Journal."  (BLM didn't ask for this plug, but his shit is cool so fucking get off your ass and buy some!) No , I seriously do need to start carrying around a notepad or something so that I can remember shit (when it comes to writing... I usually remember other things because I have my day planner).  So, in conclusion, this is kind of a weak post after such a long leave of absence, but if you don't like it, eat me.

      Alright, so I got David Cross'  urlLink Let America Laugh  DVD the other day and I finally watched it last night. Man, that's good stuff. As opposed to the typical stand-up gig DVD, it's a documentary about a tour he did a couple of years back. Now as much a I'd love to have a straight-up stand-up performance DVD (like his HBO special from a few years ago), this is  much  better.  It's not so much about the comic routine as the comedy that happens everywhere, all the time... and the stupid fucking bullshit and stupid fucking people you have to put up with when you're on tour. One of the highlights (at least in my opinion) was an interview that David Cross was giving to this twentysomething, unwashed, jack-off. This kid is going through his interview questions and it comes out that all of the questions that he's asking are based on an older interview from another magazine. Finally David asks him why in his article, he doesn't just refer people to the older interview? The kid just doesn't get it and keeps going. Well, my description hasn't been very good thus far, so I'm going to cut out while I'm only a little ways behind.  Moral of the non-story is, if you like David Cross, pick up a copy. If you don't know who David Cross is, try to find some of his stand-up to watch and make a decision. If you don't like David Cross, you're an idiot.

       No Thanks to Jesus for the Bloody Heathens at  Game Stop    So, I think that I've made it pretty evident here that I'm not a fan of organized religion, but maybe not, I don't know. That could be just in my head. Anyway, I was over at  urlLink BLM's  place on Saturday Night and I picked up a copy of  urlLink  The Book of Mormon   (I found it under a rock ) and he picked up  Ninja Gaiden .  The Adventures of Yuna in North America  was as expected, pretty fucking retarded and wasn't even that much fun while drinking. I mean, it's pretty and all, but after that intro that made me feel like a strange uncle touched me in my bathing suit area, it was kind of over. I'm sure I'll pick it up again at some point but...  Then we popped in  Ninja Gaiden ... holy fuck! That game is pretty, fun and  urlLink hard as shit  (and I'm not touching hard mode). Anyway, that game snapped something in me. I went from, "I'll get an XBox eventually," to "If I can't get an XBox, someone's fucking dead!"  Well, obviously, yesterday was Easter, or as my wife puts it, "The day Christ had spikes nailed through him so that we can get presents." This seemingly posed a problem. Neither the Media Play or Super Target we checked out was open, which had me asking why God had forsaken  me . But then my wife saw the diamond in the rough across from Target... Game Stop. Apparently Game Stop owners are going to hell as well, so they were open. As payment for being fellow sacrilegious fucks, like myself, they got a customer coming in and asking for an XBox, second controller,  Ninja Gaiden  and  DOA3 . Do the math, going to hell is well worth the money they made off of me yesterday.  So yes, I am a happy camper. After obtaining the system, we went to my parents' place for dinner. I couldn't wait until I got home, so I hooked up the box there. My parents were very entertained by  DOA3  (they both kicked each other's ass a few times). Overall, it was a great day.  But I just wanted to thank Game Stop for staying open on yet another "Lord's Day" and being willing to take my money on said day. Boody heathens, we salute you. Oh and you probably saved a life.

       Ok, I heard this on  urlLink NPR  this morning so if you want to listen to the whole story instead of just this  urlLink snippet , go there. This gives the idea though, it's just amplified by listening Christo and his wife talk.   I fucking hate pretentious artist cocksuckers like Christo. I hope that he gets mugged in Central Park while he's putting up his drapes. Hell, I hope for worse! I mean, if he and his wife  are  killed, it'll at least do something... make a good  Law and Order  episode.

      Woo Hoo! I'm never going to get  urlLink prostate cancer ! Not because I'm Big John Stud, getting pussy all the time. (I mean, I'm married. I get some when she caves... just kidding hon.) But I do have one thing going for me: I masturbate more than any man in the world. It runs in my family. My dad has a porn collection that puts almost everyone I know to shame. Now I'm talking physical porn as my dad has only limited experience with the internet as of yet. So this is excluding  urlLink BLM  and  urlLink John  who both do know the internet, but my point is my dad has a lot of porn... oh, and he rents a lot too.  Ok, back to my main point. I beat off a lot. 21 ejaculations a month (does that seem like a magic number they picked out of the air to you too?), ha! I guarantee I top that by at least 10 (in a 31 day month) and that's a slow month. Hell, if I miss a day, I'll make it up somewhere. Shit yeah, it's cool. Just to give you an example and myself some street cred, when my wife and I were dating it was a long distance relationship so we didn't get to see each other all the time. After she left after we first had sex, I couldn't get enough of myself. That next week, I averaged three times a day, topping out at six one day. Now I don't recommend that as I was fairly sore and had to drop down to one the next day, but later in the week, I got back on the horse.  Oh, and who are these pathetic sacks that only ejaculate four to seven times a month? Repressed, that's who they are! Four to seven... child's play.  So I guess that the moral is, not only should you play with your balls (as Tom Green said) but you should also be like your buddy Elijah the Prophet and "conjugate the verb" frequently so that you don't get cancer.

      Oh yeah, I found out that movie "The Girl Next Door" is about a high school kid falling for the Ex-Porn Star that moved in next door. Also, that Elisha Cuthbert looks really good in this movie. Why does she look like shit on the cover of Maxim or whatever fucking  men's  (read with disdain) magazine she was on the cover of recently. Seriously, I was like, who the fuck is this new, ugly blonde.  Also, here's a  urlLink link  to the European preview. I put this up here for two reasons:  1) Beacuse I kind of want to see this movie now  2) And to illustrate, yet again, how fucking much we suck in comparson to Europe.

      Why is ther so mush shit just wrong with  urlLink everybody ? Everyone is so fucking stupid. Lot's of thoughts running through my head as I read this article:  - Hey, alright, I like naked girls. We should definitely have more pictures of naked girls in the hallways of our hallowed institutions. I know that would help me releive stress (in the stall between classes). And girls that actually go to the school makes it an even better idea. I mean you could be walking around campus and say, "I think I've seen that girl naked," and you could be right. You could never be sure though, as the head's are removed on the pictures. Which reminds me of one of my favorite jokes:   Q: How do you describe the perfect woman? A: I don't know, but she's probably pretty hot.   - Put a "No Fat Chicks" bumper sticker on that last comment.  - Hey, how about you go to college, and  "SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT YOUR GODDAMM WHINY PROBLEMS!"  Sorry, but I went to college a few years ago, and at times I was down, but I didn't need a fucking puppy to hug before exams! You know what I did, I sucked it up and I passed my classes... or failed that one, but one fucking F isn't gonna fuck you. It's life, you're gonna fail sometimes, get used to it. Oh, and when I was really depressed, I did talk to people, they're called friends and family. People that actually care, as opposed to some jack off psych major (I'm speculating here). Oh and here's a novel idea, if you want to vent your problems, feed them to the internet community annonymously like the rest of us.  Now I admit, there are people that actually have mental disorders that do need help in college, but most of these kids are just spoiled, whiny fucks with too much time to think on their hands. Instead of thinking about the reall problems of the world, they get these "woe is me" emo ideas in their heads. You know what, kill yourself, I'm not gonna care (unless I know and like you in which case: Don't kill yourself, what are you, fucking stupid!?)  - Eating disorders are Suburban American Shit. I'm pretty sure that no one in ethopia has an eating disorder other than lack of food. As the man says, "Rich cunt don't wanna eat, fuck her!"  - What the fuck is wrong and what the fuck happened to these yuppie, boomer parents? Look, get off your kids backs, they're gonna fuck up sometimes, and you know what, that's ok! Think about what you did in school: drugs, sex, protests, more sex, more drugs and an orgy here and there. Your kids are gonna do the same thing. The fact that you acid freaks came up with "Just Say No!" is hypocritical (and stupid) beyond beleif. And why is this the slogan? Was there any real harm? From what I can tell, you ended up regretting that night with the two blonds  and  the horse, but you learned from it and still made it to where you are now... just as boring as your parents were. Chances are the same thing is going to happen with your kids.  And about the "I'm paying good money so I should see results" mentality. Stop. It's your fucking choice to take out the loan so it's your problem. Your kids are adults and don't have to answer to you anymore... legally! If you don't want to take on the financial burden, don't. Your kids can work through school and you can help them out a little and things will be fine. Or you can help them get legally emancipated and they'll be rolling in the financial aid money (I've seen it). Hell, they can even go to a state school as opposed to these pretentious, private pieces of shit. Your undergrad means dick anyway!  So that's what I've got, I should get back to work now.

      Well, it's Sunday and I really don't have anything of note to 'blog about, but i figure that I better get one in just to keep myself on track. So I guess this is going to be one of those:  Hey, I'm so important that everyone wants to know what I did this weekend because their lives are just as bankrupt as mine. Woo hoo!  Seriously, I am not the one to come to for an interesting update. Seriously, here's my weekend:  - Friday: Ate at Chili's, saw  Hellboy . (Pretty decent flick BTW, there were some problems I had initially with character development, but as I look at it more, it may just be that I'm not used to someone getting a comic book movie right. It really was like a single story arc, simply as snapshot in one piece of the characters' lives. The ending was a little anti-climactic, but other than that, I enjoyed it.)  - Saturday: Got  Red Hat 9  set up on my machine. That was a bitch. I tried just upgrading from 7.2 initially and ended up having to scrap everything, back up the important stuff and start from scratch. It's working seemingly well now, but I installed GNOME and I'm not a fan so far. I think I'm going to take a que from  urlLink BLM  and give FVWM a go. I just got to get around to installing it now.  - Sunday: Slept. I was up until about 5 am (new time) and then before going to bed, checked to see if my mom was online... she was. Talked with her until about 5:30 and finally went to bed. But not before finding episodes of  Sifl and Olly  on suprnova.org which  urlLink John  refered me to.  So yeah, boring, but good, weekend. That's about it. Now I'm going to go clean up downstairs, so I'll write something later when I have something to say.

      Alright, so I just found out that  urlLink Bizarlaritz  is my imaginary friend so I had to move her (not pre- or post-op, she's always been that way... I think) up to the posse section.

      Alright, I'm not used to having people link to me because, frankly, I'm just not very good. Apparently though, some people like what I'm doing enough (or just feel bad enough: "Look at the poor little retarded boy trying to entertain people. I should be nice and give him a link.") to link me. So here are a couple of reciprocal links.  First off,  urlLink Celtic Cross . I'm a fan of the "Tatoo of the Day" segment. I always like to see the various ways people scar themselves for life (physically, although emotionally can be fun to watch too if you're a sick prick like me). Seriously though, I've wanted to get  urlLink this tatoo  for probably the last eight years (minus the personal info stuff... but that might be cool too, now that I think about it). Maybe someday, I will, but I just can't make that scarring dicision right now.  Secondly, there's  urlLink bizarlaritz . I'm not sure if this blog is good as nothing has been written there yet, except for some links. One link is to  urlLink BLM  so I'm interested in what this guy/girl/pre-op transexual has to say.  Last off, I'm finally linking  urlLink Jared . I've read his stuff for awhile and just haven't taken the time to add him (I always just get there through BLM). Well, now I have a link here. Woo-hoo!  Anyway, there's my piss-poor update for the day. I better get back to work because I have a decent amount of things I have to accomplish before I leave for the long weekend. Although, i don't know if I can really call it a long weekend when I'm using Monday to  urlLink punish myself  for the past year's transgressions.

      In my continuing "catching up on the archives" I found this  urlLink strip . It's not really that funny, just true. If you don't agree, get over yourself you fucking dork!

      The hell he doesn't! He was out there bustin' his butt every night. And now Kareem is co-author on a book about the 761st Tank Battalion, an all black battalion during WWII.   Now, most of the time, I have no desire to read anything written by athletes. For the most part, it's just self-congratulatory bullshit written by guys with almost a third-grade education.  This, however, looks and sounds like it's a real book about something that people should care about (as opposed to the worthless lives of celebrities). If you click the title link it goes to an article with links to the NPR interview I heard this morning and it sounds like Kareem actually researched and cares about the topic. Besides, I know that Kareem is actually smart so I don't mind reading his stuff.  Anyway, if you care, and want a little history lesson, read the article. Me, I'm gonna' go out and buy the book at some point.  Oh, yeah. I almost forgot one of my most poignant thoughts while listening this morning: I want a friend named "Smitty."

      So I've been reading  urlLink Penny Arcade  on a regular basis for awhile now but I'd never really gone through the archives systematically. Well, I started doing it recently and today I happened upon  urlLink this  and laughed out loud for a good twenty-seconds.

      So last night Law & Order saw Jerry Orbach's character  Lenny Briscoe  "put in his papers" and retire from the force. Initial reaction: bad times.  However, throughout the episode, while talking about retirement, he keeps mentioning the DA's investigative squad. Reaction: Good times.  So it looks as if, while Lenny Briscoe will no longer be a regular member of the NYPD, he'll be coming back for some "special guest appearances" in the not too distant future.  Alright, this post is lame so I'll end it here.

      Ahh, Chicago.  You know, I really like living in the Denver area. I mean, this is a really nice area. We have the mountains in our backyard to handle all of our outdoor needs. The school system here isn't totally going to hell (yet). I don't really have to (realistically) worry about people stealing my shit or killing me (if you don't include  urlLink highway overpass girders ).  As much as I like living here, if I got an offer to move anywhere within a few hours of Chicago... fuck it, I'm out.  So as you may already know (as I get all of my site traffic from him),  urlLink BLM , my wife and I were all vacationing in Chicago this past weekend, using an anime convention as a good front for a glorified shopping expedition. Not that we didn't participate in (minimal) con activities or do anything besides shopping, but shopping took up most of our time (as a note, according to our original schedule eight and half hours were allocated to drinking, shopping took up way more).  Anyway, I could go off from here about all that happened on our vacation, however, as BLM pointed out, no one likes hearing about other people's vacations. Besides, it'll be a lot funnier when you don't care to hear about it from him.  No, I'm just going to go on and list all of the ways Chicago is better than Denver. Also, if anyone that lives in Denver is reading this and can contradict me on any of this, I'd appreciate it:  -  urlLink The Art Institute of Chicago : So my wife just finished up here school semester and she was taking an art appreciation class so we went to the  urlLink Denver Art Museum  a couple of times over the past month. Now, I like the Denver Art Museum and all, but I can maybe spend four or five hours there before getting bored. Most of it, I've seen before and it's not very big. The Art Institute, however, took up four or five hours of our time and we hadn't even scratched the surface. I mean seriously, at the end it was like, fuck it, we have to go through only the shit we really want to see and we have to do it lightning round style. I'm convinced you need three or four full days to see everything in that place.  -  urlLink Shed Aquarium : For the 1,457th time, I missed Shed on my trip to Chi-town. I'll tell you one thing though, it's got to be better than the limp dick that is  urlLink Ocean Journey   -  urlLink Mitsuwa Marketplace : As far as I know, we don't have an Asian Mall in Denver. I mean, there's the section of Federal, but nothing like Mitsuwa Marketplace. I mean, where else can I find  Masterpiece Optimus Prime , that  Cowboy Bebop  Wall Scroll I've been looking for for about a half a year and  Battle Royale  all in one place. And that's just in one store. Hitting others yields food, books and dishes as well.  -  urlLink Pizza ,  urlLink Pizza ,  urlLink Pizza : Ok, so we didn't get to hit Connie's this time (in addition to great pizza, they also have a garlic dressing that's just awesome dooode) but this weekend encapsulates some of the best pizza I've had... ever. Seriously, if you live anywhere besides Chicago (well, maybe not including New York) you're not eating good pizza.  -  urlLink Portillo's : Ever had a hot dog with mustard, relish, onions, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a pickle spear? Yeah. The Italian beef sandwiches are good too.  -  urlLink White Castle : Ok, strike one. But at least we got it out of our system. I'm out.  -  urlLink Hancock Signature Lounge : I don't need to be 96 stories up to see all of the Denver Metro area. I can stand on my tip-toes and do that. Ok that's an exaggeration, but from Hancock, you can see far, and I'm still not sure I saw the end of the lights in the distance. Besides, the tallest building in Denver is like ten feet (another exaggeration), but we do have the cash-register building... Whoopee shit. Point is, having drinks in the Hancock Observatory was fucking sweet and there's nowhere to do that (at that height, with that view) here. Oh yeah, fuck the Sears Tower!  - Mass Transit: This is a huge plus in the Chicago side over Denver. It's a bitch to get anywhere in Denver if you want to use mass transit. Most of the time you have to drive to a park-and-ride to catch the bus or the light-rail (in places where it no longer exists solely in myth and legend). At that point, what's the fucking point? I'm already in my car, might as well just drive to my destination. The only time I used the bus frequently was getting from Boulder to downtown Denver when I was in college. Except for that, RTD is near impossible to use without days of advanced planning. As for light rail, this could put Denver on the mass transit map but the problem is, it'll take a projected 20-years to get us where we need to be. The voters won't vote for something that they won't see results on in a week, let alone for 20-years.  In contrast, in Chicago you can get anywhere with ease using a combination of cabs, trains and the subway. I mean, it's so insanely easy that there's no longer even any reason to drink and drive. So here we are doomed to watching our cocks get smaller in our cars and being killed by drunk drivers. Yea.  - Shopping: Chicago has Woodfield mall (ok, it's in Schaumburg, but you get my meaning, quit being a fag). It's the largest retail space in the world. If that's not enough for you there's also Michigan Avenue which has pretty much every store that I really want (besides those in the Asian mall). Plus it has Rampage. Now this is probably a lame store in general, but it gave me an excuse to hit things and say "Congratulations" to random people. Plus my wife got this dress that looks fucking amazing on her there. As a side note you can go to the  urlLink Chicago Place  shopping center if you want some random creepy guy to ask you for the rest of the potato you had for lunch and conclude with "That's good food. Praise the lord!"  - Anime Convention Guests: I'm just going to keep this simple. Chicago will always have better convention guests than Denver, because Denver is a fly-over city. Denver is a fly-over city because there's nothing to do here (the mountains are a different story, but the city sucks). If you don't agree, ask yourself how you would entertain Nabeshin for a day in Denver.  - My In-Laws: Strike two for The Windy City, but if you look above, there have been a few runs scored.  So yeah, that's my summation of why Chicago is so much better than practically everywhere else, using Denver as a comparison. The End.

      Alright, so now I'm going to attempt a real post. Problem is everyone has already posted on everything that is important. I missed the Iraqi prison photos by a bit and anything I say now is just going to be a re-hash of what's already been written/said. There's other stuff going on as well, but you couldn't tell by listening to the radio or watching the TV thanks to our great American media. Besides, I don't really feel like commenting on anything of importance anyway.  So where does this leave me? Why, raniting about inane bullshit that's pissing me off, of course. Alright, here we go.  So I'm looking up something on  urlLink dictionary.com  the other day and I see this add for classmates.com (I'm not linking this because I think it's worthless. Any of the people I went to high school with and care to know about, I talk to. I'm not going to virtually stalk them over a stupid pay-for-play website.)   So I see this add, I'm sure you've seen this shit too, that says "He married her!? And they had seven kids!??" My first response is, "Why do you care?" Myabe if you liked him so much you should have gotten better at giving head. Or if you fancied her maybe you should have bought her that diamond ring instead of giving her that pearl necklace in the back of your Dodge Dart.  But than I got to thinking (of course borrowing from various satnd-up acts), What the fuck do these people need with seven kids!? Are they selling them into slavery so that they can do menial tasks to serve the rest of us? Because, if so, right on. That's something I can get behind. A flock of brainless twits to serve me. As long as the prices are reasonable, I'm in.  But no. I'm sure the kids aren't simply being used as chattle for the good of mankind (just their parents). So what the fuck is the point of having that many kids? There are over six-billion people on this planet! We're overpopulated and most of the population is stupid anyway. Why do you need seven kids? Answer: you don't! Somebody should forceably remove that bitch's ovaries with a salty spoon. And cut off her hussband's dick while you're at it!  Bloody hell, I hate how this culture reveres spawning:  Yea! You fucked and his sperm can swim and her eggs can accept, yea! Good for you! It's so admirable.  Meanwhile the kid is fucked because they were both high on paint thinner the whole damn time.  As always, I end with an I don't know where I'm going with this except that I want to point out that people are praised when they get knocked up and they aren't shot when they don't take care of their kids. I think that's a travesty. Also, fuck everyone that's so goddamn selfish that they need more than two kids. Replacement is fine, and if you have more because of unexpected twins, that's fine. For couples that have more though, I think that one of the parents should be shot of the face of the planet to even things out... and guarantee he/she doesn't reproduce anymore.

      Alright. Blogger has changed. People are pissed. Dogs and cats, living together. Total anarchy.  I really don't have anything I care to post about today and I should probably get back to work. But since I went with a new template (which I have to say isn't half bad) I figured that I should post something.   Oh yeah, I changed my title to something  urlLink BLM  and I talked about this weekend because it's more appropriate to my posting pattern.  As per evidence above, I do still explain the joke though.

       Current Music Selection: Atmosphere - Free or Dead   A good track to escape a banal existance by driving around to.

      ...or is this a purge. I mean on one hand it could be considered binging on 'blogger, on the other, it could be purging the thoughts from my head on to the internet. Hmm.  Anyway, I noticed that a lot of people tend to list music that they're listening to while posting. Well, I have things to say when it comes to music, and I have a damn lot of it. For this reason, I will begin to post the stuff I'm listening to as well.  Without further ado:   Current Music Selection: Fear of Pop - Root to This   For those of you that missed  Fear of Pop Volume 1 , it's the Ben Folds project that came out in 1998 when all of us loyal fans were waiting for the amazing  Messner  to come out (the wait was very worth it by the way). I've always refered to this album as "Ben Folds Fucks Around." It really defies description. When you have a track that sounds like something out of a 70s Blaxploitation flick, a track that's a remix of BFF bassist Robert Sledge's name and a track with William Fucking Shatner doing spoken word all on the same album, there's really no place to file it.  Anyway, then there's  Root to This . Ben Folds' stab at electronica complete with his wife yelling vocals. With lines like "When I say the word, all you wankers piss off!" it's no wonder he married her. It makes for a good dance track and I personally think it should be played in more clubs. That's really it though. Try and take a listen to this album though.  So, I was going to write more but work is really busy at the moment. I should get back to the grind.

      So I foun this  urlLink link  over at  urlLink Galvin's page  today. I haven't gotten a chance to start playing the game yet but after watching the intro... Look, if you've ever wondered what Voltron (under the control of TB, of course) sodomizing the Statue of Liberty would look like, try this game.  On thing though, I do think that they ripped off  urlLink Get Your Voltr On  on their portrayal of Voltron, but it's funny so that's ok.

       urlLink Wow . You know, I've been asking for this for years. Literally. I was asking for this back when I had an N16 and  Super Mario All-Stars  came out. Apparently Capcom finally listened to my pleas and... it's here.   Megaman is still my favorite game series ever. Sure, there were some crap ones, but overall, it's better than  your  game series.  Wow... I think I'm crying.

      So I ran the  urlLink Bolder Boulder  on Monday and I'm almost not sore anymore. I didn't get under an hour this year. I was right around 64-minutes. Not horrible. Not great. I really wish that I could get right around 50-minutes again. (My personal best was just under 50-minutes. This was accomplished on the weekend of my high school graduation with a guy that graduated with me. We were both hung over, but having each of us there to pull the other along gave us a really good time.) My goal for this year was under an hour, but it seems that will have to wait until next year.  So even though I didn't get the time I wanted this year, it was still better than last. Last year I was up aroung 68 minutes and I hadn't trained much at all. Don't do that! At least, not if you're out of shape. Last year was like fucking  urlLink Viewtiful Joe ! I'm never not training again after that.  So now my goal is to keep running through the summer. As motivation, I think that I'm going to start signing up for races on a regular basis. That way, if I train, less pain will be my reward. Wow, that's masochistic.

      So  urlLink Francis Crick died today  and that guy was awesome. You can't get much better than basically creating molecular biology. My favorite part of that article (and Crick himself):   Indeed, the desire to replace religious with rational explanations of life was a principal motivation of Dr. Crick's career.   If you can't get behind a guy like that, you're not smart.  I could go on about all of the shit he did, but you should just read the article.

      So back when I was in college,  urlLink BLM  and I had this idea. Since high school, the two of had been becomming disillusioned with... well, pretty much everything. One of our most frequent targets during our various rants and recitations of our "Enemies Lists" was religion in general and particularly Christianity.  One night I decided to take a stand (or not because I'm currently four years late on this one. But my dad owed BLM a dinner for three years once before he payed up. At the time BLM said it was one of the best dinners he's ever had so I think it's justified. Other point is it runs in my genes.), with BLM's encouragement of course, I was going to run for God in 2000!  Seriously, I'm pretty sure that there are a lot of people that are a little fed up with the incumbent God. I mean, he seems pretty lazy to start with: When was the last time God talked to anyone? Gave anyone a real, definitive sign? Helped anyone out? I mean, sure, there are those that say that God gave them strength, but how do you know that was God and not just some other deity; or mind over matter even? Did you see God? As far as we know, the last time God did shit was about 2000 years ago and all he did was pop out a son to die here on Earth because he was too busy to do it himself. Hell, we don't even  know  that that Christ guy was really his kid, nut was probably off his rocker!  Bottom line is: "What has your God done for you lately?" I have a feeling that if you asked the average person on the street, he or she, could not, with difinity, give an answer other than "nothing." Sure, some people will tell you that since they found God, their lives have improved, but really, they have no basis. The construct of God they developed in their heads is what they're talking about, not a real God. Real incumbent God hasn't done shit.  That's where I come in. I think it's time that people had an alternative to the current "devine being" and I think I'm qualified to be that alternative. My basic platform is simple: I'm human, just like you (although, if any dingos care to vote for me, I will cater to your needs as well) and I'm not invisible. Basic? Sure. But I plan on going into more details in the future, outlining my plan, and I think you'll appreciate it.  As of this moment here, I've thrown my hat into the ring:   ELI FOR GOD IN 2005!

      I haven't had this much fun in five to ten minutes of playing around on a  urlLink website  in awhile. I really think that this could be the pinnacle of online entertainment. Fuck paying a monthly charge to play  Final Fantasy XI  or  City of Heroes . (Seriously, fuck that! I'm not paying a monthly charge for a game I already paid for. That's crap.) This is much more entertaining.  All I kept thinking, my whole time on the site, was: "Wow. Mike Seaver thinks I'm going to hell. Not just that, he's actually telling me that I'm going to hell. Wow. That kid doesn't have a career." Also, I'm apparently guilty of all Ten Commandments which is pretty fucking sweet. I didn't realize that the hatred in my heart equates to murder, but apparently...  Seriously, I thought that Mike was raised by a good family that was more tolerant than all that. Jason was a shrink for Christ's sake. (There's a commandment.) I guess when everyone realzes that you're a hack and your acting career goes into the toilet, you knid of have to turn to God. How else are you going to make money if you don't take it from people that are scared and stupid.  Yeah, I should probably have stopped after that last paragraph but while looking around on  urlLink IMDB , it looks like all Mike's been doing lately is making  Growing Pains  sequals and that  Left Behind  (I want to fuck a 2000 year old dead guy) crap. Reading the summaries I guess they take on the Antichrist. Go antichrist (unless the  urlLink Pope is right )!  Then I started thinking about  Growing Pains : Didn't Mike have a friend named Boner? I'm pretty sure that Boner's not making it to heaven. Then there was that spin-off  Just the Ten of Us , some of those chicks were pretty hot, and a few of them were trashy. I wonder if they'd fuck Jesus.

       As a note, before starting this movie I was already aware of the 9-minute rape scene.   So  urlLink BLM  thinks that I should continue to do reviews so here goes.  I saw  urlLink Spider-Man 2  today and much like the first, I enjoyed it. We start out about two years after the original and Peter Parker is fucking up his life because he's spending too much time doing the whole Spider-Man thing. I mean these fucking kids today need to get their priorities straight. When I had a mid-term, do you think that I was out spending all of my time out saving humanity... hell no! At least, that tends to be the opinion of everyone with whom he interacts. Of course, they don't know that he's Spider-Man, but half of them hate that guy anyway.   I don't feel like going into plot because everyone's going to see this movie anyway, so I'll try a different direction this time.   Peter begins examining his life and the central question of the film becomes, when you have the power to do something to help others, are you obligated to do that thing, even if it means sacrificing the shit important to you? In my opinion the film answers with a resounding "no." I mean Spider-Man quits. He says "Fuck this shit, I'm living  my  life! I do what I want!" (That's a direct quote from the film, in a rare Spider-Man appearance on Ricki Lake, by the way.)  But Peter Parker is a good guy. At this point in his life he's not Peter if he's not Spider-Man. There's this whole metaphore, of not being able to see clearly that wasn't too over the top, but a little cliche. Anyway, when he finally goes back to being Spider-Man, the point is made that Peter chooses to be Spider-Man. He does it for the pure reason that he needs to help, not for his ego, which brings us to Doc Ock.  Dr. Otto Octavius starts out as a non-descript "scientist" researching fusion and on the verge of a breakthrough. While showing off his new process, he "needs" to utilize the famous Doc Ock robotic arms in order to perform his fusion demonstration. Also, there's something about the AI of the arms being so sophisticated that they need an inhibitor chip to keep them from controlling Otto. I don't really understand this point and I'm sure that no one involved in the scripting process could explain it to me but, fuck it. Movie "science" is all schlock anyway. That aside, an inevitable disaster comes along killing Otto's wife and assistant, Anij (yes BLM,  that  Anij), and breaks the inhibitor chip, driving Otto to become the villian in this feature.  Anyway, at this point Doc Ock, becomes obsessed with performing his fusion exercise again and on a much larger scale. He and his mechanical arms decide that they must give humanity fusion. But Ock, unlike Peter, is more absorbed with his own recognition and greatness than with actually helping humanity... I mean, he doesn't once look in his notebooks to make sure he didn't make a rounding error. As a side note, Alfred Molina is fucking great. That guy is a really good actor and plays Ock... well, as he should be played.  On the other hand, Kirsten Dunst is a hack. Really, she sucks in this movie (and a lot of things she's been in lately). I mean fuck, she had potential as a kid. It's like she gets worse every year older she gets. I'm pretty sure next year she'll be retarded. I don't even really want to talk about the love crap between Peter and Mary Jane (which made up a sizable portion of the movie) because I have to think about her awful, awful dialogue delivery. Let me put it this way, at one point in the movie, she's in a play and Peter comes to see it. When she realizes he's there, she falls out of character and forgets her line. I couldn't tell if she was just playing falling out of character or if she, fell out of character falling out of character. I'll end with this conclusion on Ms. Dunst, she's an awful actress but at one point you can see her nipples through her extremely tight dress.  Alright, I'll tie this up soon. The movie is pretty good overall. The science is crap and Dunst sucks, but it is a really fun movie and I'll be damned if I didn't get a little choked up during the  urlLink Cool Hand Luke  scene and the subsequent scene with the little kids finding Spider-Man's mask. (I'm a pussy, I've fucking cried during the South Park movie. I was very vulnerable at the time though so leave me alone.)   The end of the flick however, was pretty heavy-handed and unnecessary. It was pretty obvious what was going to happen, but the makers felt the need to spell it out and blatently advertise for the sequal. Plus the love crap could have been done more subtlely, and without as much shit spewing forth from Dunst's mouth.  So yeah, watch the movie. Despite all of my bitching, I'll go see it again. I think BLM still needs to see it so I'll be up for it sometime this week. Like I said, it's fun. Fin.

      Oh yeah, almost forgot.   Current Music Selection: Self - Sassy Britches   Proof that white boys rapping doesn't always suck. Closes with one of the best string of rhymes possible including such lines as... fuck it, they're all good lines. Just go to  urlLink Selfies  and you can read the outro rap  urlLink here  (at the bottom of course). Or better yet, just get a copy of  Half-Baked Serenade .

       As a note, before starting this movie I was already aware of the 9-minute rape scene.    Irreversible  has annoying camera work. When the closing credits begin rolling backward at the beginning of the film, my first reaction was "Oh, geez." Then they start with the camera shit about half way through the credits. Now, I had wanted to see this movie, particularly because  literally  everyone that has seen it has to talk about it and the brutality within, but my head was either not in the game or the film's director is one of the most pretentious fucks in the world. Giving the director the benefit of the doubt, I'm going to go with a combination of the two. Let's face it, wheter you like it or not, this guy is pretentious.  We start with a scene of two older guys talking about incest and prison. Oh they're also adding in little faux philosophical phrases like "times destroys all things" (No shit? I prefer to think that we're the all singing, all dancing crap of the world.) and "there are no bad deeds, just deeds" (It's "Deeds Not Words"! Didn't you see  Megaforce ?) So a few minutes into the movie were taken outside of "Club Rectum." Where one of the film's characters, presumably one we will get to know though the backward telling of the apparently horrific events, is being wheeled on a stretcher to the chants of "faggot, faggot, faggot..." which I take to mean he must have done really well in the soccar tournament.  While all of this is going on, this one guy is laughing in the corner in front of a computer monitor. If you take a closer look, you notice that on the monitor, there are a bunch of Korean kids in fucked up sexual situations. A guy begins groping a girl's breasts while she is passed out and she wakes up and smacks him, pissed because they were just going to hold hands; another guys is about to get some when he thrusts too hard, misses and hits the wrong hole (as this is not the U.S. navy); and a third focuses on a couple in which the girl is not ready for sex, so she gives the guy a hand job which leaves her arm sore for the next day.  Suddenly, there is longer horrific camera work and brutality, but lighthearted humor featuring a Korean cast in a film created by connoisseurs of bad American 80's movies. The pretension of  Irreversible  is gone, replaced by the antics of the cast of characters in  Sex is Zero . The flick focuses on a group of college kids consisting of a group of guys that are into extreme things.  Things  is the most technical and appropriate word I can use as this runs the gammut from breaking boards over their heads, to attempting to drown themselves, to drinking liquid with a bunch of crap and cigarette butts in it. The female characters are all part of the university aerobics team. Somehow these two groups come together and go to the national tournament at the end.  It's all a little hazy at points: one, because we came in late so much like  Irreversible  we watched the film out of order; and two, because there was this goddamm rape scene coming from the other side of the room that kind of killed the mood (not really, we still laughed on cue, but it was annoying).   The protagonist of the film was this guy that had the best facial expressions in the world, and was a motherfuckin' dance machine. He is, of course, in love with one of the aerobics hotties that is already attached. This guy gets shit on in every way possible throughout the first part of the movie: he thinks there's a fire and jumps out a 3rd story window, he eats a rat poison and fried cum sandwich, gets kicked in the balls, takes a large does of the active ingredient in viagra and is found jacking-off by said love interest, etc. All of the quality components of the genre.  Then the movie takes a turn that reminds you that this is not a bad 80s American movie but, in fact, Korean. The aerobics hottie is impregnated by her asshole boyfriend and needs an abortion. She asks our hero to come with her and, not knowing it's an abortion, he assumes it's a date. When his buzz is killed (much like ours until  urlLink BLM  said something funny), he proves that he is the greatest guy in the world by taking care of her and making an ass of himself to keep her in high spirits. Anyway, the film ends with the aerobics championship, where dance machine is hit in the head with a sledgehammer and aerobics hottie gives the performance of her life, then bleeds herself into the hospital.   As a note: YOU SHOULDN"T DO AEROBICS A FEW DAYS AFTER AN ABORTION!!!  Anyway, everyone finds out about the abortion and her mom is furious, but somehow that all gets cleared up. The film bookends itself with another fire and our now happy couple (not exactly clear on how that happened, they just seemed to be together all of the sudden) jumping out the 3rd story window with matching rings on (that have some symbolism that either I missed, or wasn't really there).  In conclusion, there are two main things to take away from this whole experience. One, I am a piss poor movie reviewer. I mean I started out fairly strong, but it just fell apart by the end. You really shouldn't be reading my stuff. And two, if your going to watch  Irreversible , don't. Go online and download a copy of  Sex is Zero . There's some ill shit in it, but it's much easier to take because of the humor, and there is no dillusion by the creators of having made an important film.

      Alright,  urlLink this  actually seems to be a good casting job. If anyone could pull of the part, it would be Steve Carell. Both actors (Carell and Don Adams) have a similar delivery style. As long as the script isn't shit, it could make for a good flim... but who's going to be 99?  I know that  urlLink BLM  is a huge  Get Smart  fan (if I remember correctly, it was 7th grade that he went as Maxwell Smart for Halloween... looking sharp as shit, I might add) so I'm interested to hear what he thinks.

      So the other day I was looking around on  urlLink Jared's blog  and saw his section for nerdcore hip-hop. I tend to enjoy a lot of nerdcore just because it tends to be about shit I care about. In fact, at one point I was determined to become a rapper that only busted rhymes about Chemical Engineering topics: process, equipment sizing, etc.   Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) this dream fell into the 93% abyss.  So I still haven't had a chance to check out  urlLink Optimus Rhyme  yet, but I plan on getting around to it soon (I just can't really check it out here at work, that's all). However, this weekend I was watching my  Aqua Teen Hunger Force  and  Sealab 2021  discs and stumbled upon  urlLink mc chris .  Wow.  When I first heard "I Want Candy" in the MC Pee Pants episode of ATHF, I found it annoying, but catchy (not an original concept by the way the show treated the track). Of course "For Da Shorties" showed up and it was more of the same.   In the Sealab episode they went to an  mc chris  show and as I listened, I realized he was rapping about Boba Fett. Fucking Boba Fett! From that point, I had to seek out more.  Well, I ended up finding his website and downloaded his album  urlLink Life's a Bitch and I'm Her Pimp ... this man is a genius. "fett's vette" is, indeed, about Boba Fett and how he's a bounty hunter in order to pay for his phat ride. "the tussin (robotussin)" has to be one of the best though. Anyone that samples the theme song from the original  Gauntlet  and writes lyrics like "I'm trippin' like Jesus in the desert when he fasted" is definitely on to something.   So yeah, I really enjoy  mc chris , if you've got any interest, download the album (just fucking do it, it's free). And Jared, if you like it, that's another link to add under nerdcore hip-hop, so that's something.
