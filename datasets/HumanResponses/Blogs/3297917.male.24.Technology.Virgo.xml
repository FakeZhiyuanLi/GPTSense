      Well yesterday and the day before were rather interesting.    It starts with me getting off work Monday to find that my engine temp was going nutso on my way home from work.  Turns out my car radiator decided to go bad and was spewing engine coolant all over the place.  So pretty much I had to just keep refilling my car with coolant if I wanted to drive anywhere. *fun fun*  At least my presentation on Cuba went well at class despite lingering headaches all day.  So yesterday 2 of my friends helped me out and drove me to the auto parts store and we got a replacement radiator and they put it in. All I gotta say is I owe those guys big time!.  The f'ing dealership wanted $600 to replace the thing and they were able to do it for $145 (cost of the radiator itself).  I must say knowing people who are car junkies really comes in handy.

      Well this is the first time i've really posted in a journal type thing so i guess i'll just start with recent happenings during the last 2 days.  I was an idiot this weekend and put off finishing a presentation for class till the last minute.  Saturday having work in the morning then going out with my friend Kelly to see her brother's band play at Nation (her bro's band is pretty decent!).  So Saturday was rather unproductive.    So then came sunday...had a midterm in the morning that i fortunately still got an A on even though i didn't get to study as much as i wanted. (having 2 4 hour classes on sundays sucks!) Then after i got out of class I got an invite to go see Van Hellsing (mmmm Kate Beckensale).  We were SUPPOSED to go see a 6:30 show but since my friends are lazy asses we didn't get to go see it till the 9:50pm show. *sigh  So all and all i've been exhausted the last week.  Lets count 34 hours of standing on my feet dealing with idiot mason sudents at near minimun wage.  12 hours of class...a midterm to study for, 2 projects that needed finishing, and more social engagements than i really had time for. Yeah...fun week.  So i called out of work today so i could get my presentation done, and i didn't actually get finished till 9:45pm. (yes i get destracted easily) and in the process totally forgot i made plans to hang out with someone else tonight. At least she forgot too so all's well and good. :)  ~Mike
