      I woke up this morning thinking today was Friday- and then realized the bad news- that I have to go to work again tomorrow... Definitely does not set a positive tone for the work day. Why is it that we drones (drones reminds me of Clockwork Orange- yeah?) have to work a set amount of hours a day, seems so odd, but whatev, I know we all gotta pay our bills right. I guess that is one of the reasons I'm doing this now- I've turned into an expert at procrastinating and distracting myself at work. Once I broke 60 friends on friendster, I guess it's time to move on to blogging? Ohhh, what's next cyberworld? What are you going to throw at me next? For someone that lived in San Francisco during the dot com and saw what all those yuppie hipsters did to my beautiful fair city- I remember it fondly as a child... I still have a weird obsessive fascination with the internet and all that it is capable of. Like what's that thing, that search engine that can pull up videos, music, photos- anything... the name went out of my head right now. Brant and I found the Paris Hilton video on it. Anyway, I digress. Brant's going skydiving at the moment somewhere in the Santa Ynez valley. I told him to make peace with his god. I know he'll be fine, but there is something very odd about the fascination people have ( i got it too, I'll admit it) with throwing your body out of a plane. A little weird. He's going with a bunch of guys for a bachelor party (our friends are getting married on Saturday) and then to the strip bars (of course). Me- I'm off to a gourmet home-cooked dinner tonight with some good friends. Payne's the cook- another key charachter in my life that you're reading about...   See ya.

      So I've always been really hesitant to do any of this online stuff, especially the online journal, but I figured what the hell- right?  Something about random strangers reading about your life (yeah I'm talking about you-) just kind of gives me the heebie jeebies.  You ask then why are you doing it?  Good questions- not exactly sure.  Maybe I'll figure it out as I go along, but until then, I guess I'll give it a good effort anyhow.  This past weekend was 4th of July.  Mixed feelings about celebrating my country's independence, since it feels so hypocritical when we seem to be oppressing nations around the world, and continue to keep our troops in a war that most of the country does not stand behind.  This seems to be the new face of America.  But, I do love my country and all that it was founded on, so I will raise a glass to what America means to me.  Unfortunately, here in San Francisco, the fireworks were clouded by the thick fog.  Fog in July, I know- quite the drag.  Caught some of the East Bay's on TV later.  Spent most of the day walking through the Presidio from the Marina with my boyfriend Brant to my apartment in the Haight.  Quite a long walk- probably about 3-4 miles, in flip-flops nonetheless, might explain my limping today...  Later...

      Can't you just feel it?  Someone reading my every word, almost the second after I type it?  I can.  And it's weird.   I know who you are.  You know I know who you are...  But whatever...  Thursday...I seem to write on Thursdays, maybe because the weight of the week starts to kick in- that feeling of why don't I live in Europe where the work days are shorter and they have a 3-4 hour siesta in the middle of the day?  Now that's life/work balance- come on Americans!  Are we  really   being productive 8 hours a day?  I think not.  Oh, I digress...what's on my mind, what's on my mind... I need to spruce up my blog a bit- ya know, give it some fancy links and such- hey you out there, reading- yeah you!  You want to give me some pointers with that since I know you know how?  That'd be great, thanks.  ok, i'm out for now....
