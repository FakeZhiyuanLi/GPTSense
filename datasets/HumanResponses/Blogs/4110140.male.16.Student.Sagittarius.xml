      Hehehe....Welcome to the first entry of the madman! Where do I begin then? Well, just let me briefly tell you of one of the "milestones" in my life. I used to live a life as an inordinately normal and genetically stable person, before I transformed into the madman you know today! It all happened so sudden, and "poof!" I got strickened with a mysterious disease that was to have a drastic impact on my seemingly normal life. The cause of this disease is unknown though I believe it to be a result of a frameshift mutation which had occurred so inopportunely. The effects of it were palpably felt in Sec 4, characterised by a sudden loss in strength and a gradual and (later critical) loss of memory! WAHHHHHHHHHH! Scary isn't it? Hehehe.... I believe I had been afflicted with this disease probably much much earlier, just that the effects then were not so obvious.  Actually, the scariest part of this disease lies not in the devastating effect it has on the innocent victim ( though already scary enough to make all but the most phlegmatic individual jump and kill themselves) but that the symptoms are so hard to detect from an outsider's point of view! I myself admit that I look quite normal on the surface (save the occasional eccentricities), but who knows that I am indeed suffering? Who? Not even those dearest to me! Not even the so-called neurologists from the National Neuroscience Institute which I had sworn to obliterate should I have the chance! Haha! And what is left of me! Pain! Pain! Pain! Yet, in spite of these, I can actually force out a smile most of the time in front of ignorant people ( I am indeed one of those geniuses who have the exceptional ability to smile even in times of anguish. To this I truly admit.)  Whenever I try to make it a point that my inefficency is partly due to this mysterious disease, loud sneers and snide remarks would be almost simultaneously audible. What upsets me most is that they come from the mouths of my friends and even family members. These are the people whom I value most, why have they done these to me in the first place? Why? I cannot conceive of any reason other than the total loss in sympathy as a result of this degenerating world. What a world to live in! Huh! Personal glorification is perhaps another reason I can come out with and this applies to my contemporaries. Why? If my impaired mind and body allow me to produce results that are almost as good ( or even better sometimes) as that of other normal individuals, where do these people stand then? They simply cannot make it! Then that really huge ego of theirs to cloak their inferiority will never allow them to accept my explanations. What a shame!These words are not written for the sake of even the slightest attempt at any lamentation over my own loss or whatsoever. What I merely want to say is that some things ought to be changed.  I have always hoped for a better world but this seems quite impossible now. I would try to transform it if I could, if not I would destroy it with every power I could channel. God wouldn't blame me, would he? Does he even exist in the first place?
