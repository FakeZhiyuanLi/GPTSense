						   I woke at about 6am this morning (thank you jet lag), had my cold shower (gas is expensive, so the hot water gets turned off in the hot weather) which I've gotten used to, and went out for breakfast. Walked through the everything store which is unavoidable since it assimilated the sidewalk , got a pair of sandals and a bag, and exited with receipt in hand. You pay the Taiwan lotto with the receipts-- they each have a number printed on them like lotto tickets, so you save your receipts to play.  OK, so this is breakfast: a man with a kitchen stand on the sidewalk has set up a bench and some chairs, and this is what you get from him-- miso soup with minnows, very good, slightly sweeter than most miso soups I've had. There are some veggies and little minnows... not quite how to describe eating a minnow. Kind of chewy, not much taste. So that's to drink. The main dish is sticky rice. It's a pyramid of sticky rice that's been cooked in a banana leaf, unwrapped in front of you when you buy it. About the size of a softball. At the bottom, there is a layer of peanuts that have seemingly been stewed a few hours to get them soft as any cooked bean. This mass of rice and peanuts is covered first with breadcrumbs, and then a thick, brown, sweetish sauce, that probably has some brown sugar in it. Then goes on the yellowey hot sauce, just hot enough to give your mouth a nice lasting heat, but not enough to make you run for the water. The miso soup, yes, but not the water. You eat the miso soup with a plastic, Asian style spoon, the rice with chop sticks.  Sounds strange for breakfast? Maybe, but I ate six hours ago and I'm still full. For 30 dollars too.  Oh yeah, so-- 33-34 Taiwanese dollars is exchanged for 1 US dollar...

						   Yeah, it's a great experience going up in a small plane out of Tokyo, seeing the city lit us beneath me, than noticing the reddish lightening off in the distance, slowly getting closer...  Very bumpy ride...

						   I'm still beat from coming over, and my body doesn't seem to want to accept my new sleeping patterns. When I go to sleep at night, it wakes me up after two hours, thinking I've had a lovely nap, refreshed and invigorated!!!  But aside from that, things are going well.  I went to see that place that we'll most likely be staying at, a nice little place outside the outskirts of town. Lots of bamboo, some pineapple fields, and plenty of trees. It is a little out in the open though, in respect to thunderstorms, one of which hit while I was there. The owner pointed to a garden across from his house with a burned down palm tree, telling me that the last time there was a storm a bolt of lightening came down, hit the tree, exploded a telephone pole along with his telephone line and telephone... but there is a park across the way, so I'm sold.  It's an odd experience being a foreigner here. People are very willing to help you get what you want, and language barriers have been met with humor so far, rather than with animosity towards my obvious shortcomings in Taiwanese dialects. A little different than some of the arrogance I've seen some westerners treat someone who doesn't know English...  Anyway, last night I went out at about 11pm, after a four hour nap (since I only got an hour's sleep the night before) looking for some food. There's a great little vegetarian place a few blocks away so I headed there. I stopped at the everything store (it seems like it's open 24 hours, so you can get those pantyhose or a new rice cooker at anytime of the night), got some lead for my pencil and a bottle of water (since the smaller Taiwanese eateries only serve soup to drink), paid my NT$1 for a plastic bag, as is customary-- this I didn't understand until I went to a 7-11 where they actually scanned a barcode on the bag, adding the dollar to my total. It then became apparent to me why the day before, when I was buying socks and green tea at the everything store, the woman at the country kept telling me "one, one" when I asked for a bag, then muttered something to the other customers when I left with the bag thinking "of course I only want one bag!" So, I go to the veggie place by myself (for the first time, since usually I've been with Tony, the guy who I'm renting my room from-- a nice Australian man who's been working here for a year to save up money to learn to play the sitar in India, and he speaks some Taiwanese), and try to communicate that I'll eat anything. After a few minutes of lots of hand gestures and a little help from a customer who spoke a little English, I was able to procure a bowl of fresh cooked noodles and vegetables in a peanut sauce, and a bowl of vegetables soup for about 1.25 US dollars.  While I was eating, the owner tried having a conversation with me, saying something about my hair (either that it's very nice and she wanted to know what shampoo I used, or that it was too long and she knew a good barber. I honestly am not sure which of the two it was, but she was very nice about it either way). The locals work very, very long hours. Stores open early and close late, many are open what seems like 24 hours, and when I've gone for walks late at night I see the owners catching some sleep in a chair while their kids eat or play nearby.  Sidewalks don't so much exist as US cities have them. Buildings are built with their second story out over the sidewalk, supported by pillars. What is underneath is the sidewalk, and the stores that line it are totally open, with a metal gate to pull down at night. The store and it's contents spill out onto the sidewalk, cars and scooters are usually parked on the sidewalks which is why you don't see too many baby carriages, though they do exist and it is theoretically possible to use them.  Well, that's all for now.  Next time I'll write about my life on a scooter-- I got a five minute lesson from Tony, seven minutes to practice and we hit the roads. In a land where traffic lights are ornamental and using turning signals is frowned upon, the daily commute is, as one of my housemates put it, an extreme sport every day.  I've noticed myself praying a lot more often...

						   And so, I have arrived.  I am safe, this place is amazing. I'm going to write more about the trip, flying through a typhoon, the sea of scooters, but I'm overwhelmed.  It is a lot like Queens, especially Main Street in Flushing (but on speed), and the countryside looks like Main Street imposed itself over Upstate New York. It is a bit polluted, but certainly no more than Times Square (here is little Tainan, anyway), but there are trees and plants anywhere they'll spring up, or anywhere someone can plant or pot them. Everything is so dense, so smushed in that it's quite beautiful. But in the end, it's not so different than home. I don't feel on the otherside of the world.  No matter where you go, there you are, right? So, it looks like rain so I'm headed back to my rented room. Internet cafes are everywhere, with fresh food served in them. Anyway, soon I'll figure how to post pictures...  I'll write more tomorrow.  BCnU

						   Tomorrow I leave...  Early, 4:30am in the car, off to JFK.  After the packing and the re-packing (to keep my bags under 70 lbs each...) I'm just tired. So, I've settled down to the computer with a nice, cold Queens style 40 of cheap beer (no , not the usual malted liquor, tonight it's special! Real beer!! Cheap, but real...) and send out a post before I go.  I wonder if I should compose some sort of Last Will and Testament... to ward off the fates. If I don't, the fates will be all ironic: "Oh," they'll say at my funeral, "he said he wouldn't need a Will, and now look... if only we had some sort of way *sniff* to know who he'd want his Babylon 5 video collection to go to."  It goes to my brother.  And Cecilia gets a bottle of my Dandelion wine, so does Bethany. I've always wondered if Bethany knows she's named after a small biblical town... she probably does. I usually spout off such interesting biblical facts to people I know for more than a few hours. Once, when I was working for the Dean two summers ago, I had to bring an envelope over to this nice woman in accounting named Masada, and out of nowhere, I'm telling her, "Masada, yeah. Did you know that that's an ancient city built in the Roman era upon a plateau, nearly impenetrable, where a band of Jewish rebels held off a Roman army for months before finally committing mass suicide instead of becoming roman slaves and whores?"  In fact, she didn't know.  Anyway, Bethany gets some dandelion wine, (some of the '04) and Cecilia gets my last bottle of '03.  Hmmm...  That's all. I'm taking the rest with me. Build a pyre out of my comic books, set me on top and send me off, burning into the Rockaway Sound.   Wow, I'm really setting the mood for this blog here, aren't I...  See you when I get there!!   Off to Betel Nut City,

						   This is how it will begin:  With nothing to say.  In just about two weeks I will be leaving for Taiwan, to the city of Tainan where my family and I (along with our honorary family member and lifelong friend Rachel) will spend at least a year teaching English and eating rice at Mc Donalds.  Now, some might say, "Isn't it a little strange, someone from Queens teaching people the finer points of the English language?" And indeed they are correct. I myself can recall a day back when I was in the sixth grade-- I was sitting at my desk while Ms. Banahan stood up at the chalkboard, furrowed brow, staring into her teacher's manual trying to explain a past participle to the class, and I staring at my desk thinking to myself,  when in life am I ever going to need to know this??  Well, now I am studying my grammar book, trying to figure out what a pronoun is, but still not quite wishing I had paid attention in 6th grade. For you see, folks, it only goes to show: The only time I ever needed to know rules of conjugation has been when teaching it to others, thus keeping the vicious circle of useless knowledge alive. I myself, a Queens native, am perfectly adept at expressing myself with a few grunts, some hand gestures, and a nod or two. But, if I give away that big secret, I'll be out of a job and a lot of old white men in bow ties will have my head.  So, I suppose I did have something to say.  I leave on the 17th of August, arrive at 9:30 in the evening the next day in Taipei's International Airport. Till then, my life is composed of packing, visa applications, absentee ballot forms, and trying not to grind my teeth too far down.
