      (elipses)  So Kevin, you desire me to update. And (don't start sentences with "and," must fix that in next draft)I suppose I should. However, my mother wants me to sleep at 12:00 a.m. today (or tomorrow, I don't really know, that's kind of tricky). And being that it's 11:48 p.m., I've only got 12 minutes to update. Wait. That didn't quite work out the way I wanted it to. See, I wanted to state the time I needed to leave and the time it is. Then the difference of the two times would be so small that I wouldn't even have time to update. Alas, that is/was/is going to be the case. So I can't really use that. So, so, so, and so. So it's now 11:50 p.m. I've wasted two minutes talking to you Kevin, via AIM. This is dumb. Also, me using words like "via" without knowing what they mean cannot help. I mean, honestly, that sentence took one minute. Damn you via. In case you're wondering, reader, that was infact/in fact/in face/inface sarcasm. Sarcasm is rather hard to detect when it's put in a text format. That's probably because sarcasm depends heavily on tone of voice. So, so, so and so. Notice that that is the second time I've said all that. Strange no? Well, no. It's not really strange. 11:53 p.m.: still awake, trying urgently (correct usage?!?!) to waste my time in an efficient, non-time-wasting manner. Wait, wait, I forgot how I planned to end this. Shit. I'm going to type elipses/periods/dots until I remember.................................................................Ah! I remember now. So anywho, it's 11:55 p.m. right now. Five minutes to 12:00 a.m. Also, I am rather tired of typing. So I am going to end it. But before I stop, I would like for you to type the typos in this entry.  42 right?  If you didn't find 42, then go to helle.  Okay, 43.  Go to hell.

       ...I find it to be kind of dumb to create drafts for a blog.

      I will post for a longer period of time!   I hate it when I try to type "know" and it ends up being "kow."  I really do. I wish that one thing would go to hell and burn!  That is, if hellexists,butIshouldn'thavesaidthatbecausesomereligiouspeoplearegoingtocallmeaheathenthenlightmeonfire.'Causethat'sreallyreallyreallyunheathenish,tolightpeopleonfire. So pretend I didn't say that.  So, continuing.  I was going to just type that first sentence up there, then just let the screen sit for like an hour, then post.  Therefore, I would have posted for a longer time. However, I like saying random things, so I'm actually going to keep typing.  I really like Iron Maiden.  They're the new black!  I love that phrase, especially when people say that "pink is the new black." 'Cause black is black and pink is just  WAY too punk rock.  Sometimes, I get the feeling that when people read this, they cry because I'm such a genius and they aren't.  But then again, maybe they think I'm just some moron who types whatever the hell comes to mind.  And they're right.  Despite the truth in that ...thing, I will continue to do this.  That is, until the Blog trend dies out. Then, I can't keep going, otherwise the football players at Temple City High  School will beat me up. Sometimes they break my glasses for fun. It's really really mean.  Plus, I can't see without my glasses.  I kind of get the feeling that it's on purpose.  Sometimes, the world is just really cruel.  Then, I remember the time that that old man gave me his life savings.  It made me feel warm and fuzzy, 'cause I got a lot of money and I nearly had a moneygasm.  I really think it's funny when girls think I'm a nice, nonperverted type. Because really, I am randy.  I mean honestly, a fifteen-year-old with access to the internet. Yeah, REAL conservative and reserved.  What it is, it is, and what it ain't, it ain't.  Sometimes, when people say really pig headed things about music, I really have to bite my tongue.  If I didn't, I'd probably bite them.  That means a lot, 'cause my tongue is more important than a lot of people. Seriously.  I'm talking to someone about bloody noses.  Don't you love it when all the blood clots in your nose? You can suck it up and spit out a bloody loogey. And  that's really cool and not at all disgusting.  I also think it's really cool that I almost spelled "disguesting" while trying to spell disgusting.  I did it again. Damn you "guesting."  Tricky shoot.  Little kids are funny.  Especially when they cry.  Because!  It makes me want to squeeze their tiny little necks until their heads explode.  But that's just me, I really can't handle little kids that well.  Or actually, I do, but I don't enjoy it.  I'm going to have a hard time when my kids' heads explode.  Especially when I have to talk to them about penises and vaginas.  What I really fear is having to deal with someone who has as much attitude as I do.   Seriously. If I managed to talk to my person (not in the way that I already do), I'd probably want to punch  him/me right in the nose.  And kill him/me.  Bastard me.  You know what I enjoy?  Reading really serious posts about serious topics.  Especially when I think they're really dumb and over-serious.  I actually was thinking about something else that I enjoyed, but that idea about serious topics jumped into my mind  and dry humped the old one into oblivion.  Wait, wait, here it comes.  You know what I enjoy?  I enjoying doodling weird pictures that make no sense, but I claim that it's just abstract art.  Really, it's cool.  I'm actually quite tired of this.  However, I have a bracelet on right now that says "LIVE STRONG ," so I will do so by pushing through   the tiredness. 'Cause that's really strong.  Someone else read this, I'm tired of only having comments from Kevin. Let me into your circle of cool!  And next time, don't just stand there and stare at my nose.  I can't help that it has two holes and air comes out of them.  I really can't, it's weird.  Except for now, since my nose is stuffed.  Yay.  I just sent this to a friend online:  "How to die in cross country: Take a porcupine and remove three spines from it's back. Take one spine and stick  it in your left eye, right next to the pupil. To the left of it, to be exact. Then run up to another runner and  yell, 'I've got a pocupine spine stuck in my eye a little left of the pupil!' Then proceed to kick him/her in the  nuts/boobs. Then take the remaining spines and stab them into your wrists. Roll around in poison ivy, then have a  round of beer with a bear. Repeat as necessary."  Good huh?  Shut up, I saw you.  Alright, let's do it for the puddle guys. Come together.  I'm sad to say this, but here is when I'm actually going to say something serious. I happened to stumble upon this   analogy(?) by reading it in one of Douglas Adams' books. Or rather, a book of his writings made by someone else.  Anyone who chooses to challenge the fact that he was a genius will be quickly lit of fire. Now, to the serious part.  Wait, no, not yet, I had this one really funny comment in my mind, but now I've forgotten it. Again, periods until  I remember..........................................................................................................  ....................................................................................................................  ...Oh yes, SOMETHINGSOMETHING bless Douglas Adams, in whatever form may he exist in, wherever, whenever, however.  Here we go:  Suppose a puddle can think. Or rather, the water of a puddle (this is serious, honestly). It's there, nice and wet,  thinking, "My my, I'm living the life. I'm wet and I've got this great indentation to live in."   It then proceeds to think about this indentation.  "My my, this identation fits rather nicely. It perfectly fits my form, down to the very molecule. It even changes   when I change. How is this possible? How can something accommodate me so well? Honestly, it's as if it was made    for  me. HEY! Maybe it  was  made for me! It makes sense! It fits me so well, it  even changes for me. It must have been made for me."  Well, that just about does it.  I'm tired.  I've pushed.  I've succeeded.  Metallica vocals are horrible. Except for in some songs.  Nevertheless, I'm successful.  Therefore, I will leave before the bubble bursts.  Peace guys, make love, not war.  (Or just something that seems hippy-ish, yet intelligent at the same time)   But, isn't it just a puddle?  Yeah, that was my intelligent and serious portion of my post.

      (Continuing from title, please refer back to it if necessary) Blogger was called Blooger(s)? I'd bet it wouldn't be as popular. So anywho.  Pink Floyd.   And also, this is the end of my post.
