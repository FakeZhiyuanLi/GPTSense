       I miss my Secondary school friends..ppl like ruth, mouy kim, huiting, pei jun, winnie, a  nd all the rest...I thought mouy would be coming to Singapore..but she's going to Japan to study instead! =( re  alli miss Secondary school days. Is friendship everlasting? I dont know. It's been quite some time eversince I've met them.. we didnt celebrated Ruth's birthday this yr...Everyone's just too busy. =( Well I'm not exactly busy, but my dad is just so stuck up. I hate to say this, but I just hate being in this family. I dont know if my dad is being strict with me, or is he   just being unreasonable. I'm already 17, and i cant even go out late. Late not meaning 12midnite, but it's only   830pm! Nvm abt controlling my time, but life at home is like shit. I'm ordered around like a slave, scolded for no reason. And there's much more to it. No one realli knows how unhappy I am.   I just choose not to share. Actually thinking abt&nbsp;it, I'm already very fortunate. At least I've aunts who are nice to me.   There are many ppl out there&nbsp;whose life are even worse.   I shld just be contented with my life rather than keep complaining! =)    Ok, so I woke up at 8 this morning, preparing to go to school for marketing tutorials. But guess what, when I reached school, my class was told tt lesson was cancelled! Mr Kenneth Wong had a car accident! Woooo! Not happy tt he had an accident, but glad tt there was no lesson. So went with my friends to the library, and then went to Mensa to makan! MAKAN   is my fave!! I love to eat! Just like emily..! Haha. Then went for Med Soc lecture...it was boring today..I was practically stoning for half of the lecture. Then went to Norgan Vaz to MAKAN again!!! Had a brownie!! Wooo! Ok I'm getting lame here again, always making weird noises and laughing for nth. But I'm just like tt. I'm lame. Anyway I walked home and it started to rain halfway. I love walking in the rain. So here I am, and I'm EATING a bun again!! It's gonna be dinner time soon and I'm still munching on my bun! Wooo I love food! Ok I'm lame again. Gotta practise piano and do theory soon! And I havent even touch journalism!! oOoohhh NoOooo! Time is running out!!! My father will be home soon. Hai. Sighs again. I think I shall not talk abt my family cos I wanna be happi!!! I may not have a happi family, but at least I've friends!! =)    Wow I think I'm being too long winded. I betta end here!

        It's been a month eversince I started Poly. Poly life isnt that relaxing and fun as I've thought. CMM is a tough course. Everyone in CMM has got the brains and everything. I do not have much brains. I'm slow. I'm born this way. No one is perfect.    I love my class and my friends!!!! Found my cliques during the first week of school. They're a great bunch of people!!! Noise and laughter can be heard where ever we are. Especially from Dan...HaHa..and me also of cos.. Getting to know my classmates better..they're great... Without them there would be no laughter, and absolutely no life for me.    Being at home is a total bore. I hate Sundays. Sundays are supposed to be fun and relaxing, but not for me. I wished I could spend time with him..or with my friends. I feel like I'm in jail every single day. I look forward to stepping out of this house, and I dread stepping back in again.    I hate doing marketing journals. I'm slow up there, and I can hardly think of ideas.    Well actually kind of regretted choosing this course, but I wouldnt have met my great bunch of friends if I wasnt here. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise, I hope. I just have to work doubly, or even triply harder in order to survive in CMM. I can do it!!!!!! =)    I wish it was weekdays..at least I could be with my friends in school. Home is such a bore! But nvm Monday will come soon...!!    Gotta go back to do marketing journal! WIll be back to update my bloggy!! =) &nbsp;   &nbsp;
