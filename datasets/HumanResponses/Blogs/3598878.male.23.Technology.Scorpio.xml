      I have come to the conclusion there are only three types of rap songs. While my whiteness may hold my views on rap music back from the popular acclaim I am sure they deserve, I submit the following three rap song classifications:  ‘Me or My Crew Are Harder than You or Your Crew’  ‘I Have More Money and/or More Hoes than You or Your Crew’  ‘Name Directions and/or City Names’   (This song, or portion of a song, usually comes near the end of the CD once the bulk of any artistic abilities of the artist or label have been drained. Marked by the combination of “East Side, to the West Side, to the North Side…,” “To all my hommies in (insert large urban area, such as ‘The NYC’ or ‘Watts’,” or some variation of the general theme)  Eminem has at times attempted to establish yet one other prominent song. The “why nobody respect/understand me” song. I resist including this as a major type because of the lack of main stream utilization in the rap industry. Minus the timeless “I wish I was a little bit taller, wish I were a baller’” examples are difficult to come by.  Well, now that you all have been informed on that topic, other news:  I purchased a 15gig iPod today. I tried to by a 4gig iPod mini, but apparently they are back ordered for 4 weeks, so I went for the bigger version. I also picked up an iTrip, which is an FM transmitter for the iPod so I can listen to music in the car. $330 all told.  I am really impressed by it thus far. I installed the software, plugged it into my laptop and next thing I know all the music on my computer is on the thing. Microsoft is pumping out what internally is being referred to as the ‘iTunes Killer,’ but I am skeptical if they’ll pull it off. Apple just has got it right. From what I’ve seen there is nothing else even in a close second in terms of usability or features to the iPod and iTunes. As long as Apple keeps innovating by adding a color screen, Bluetooth, and so type of inter device portability story I’d doubt Microsoft will compete in the short run.  I do have to say I feel a little bit like listening to Devo and renting 2001 a Space Odyssey after being in the Apple store. Everything was white and round with strange futuristic androgynous overtones.   ~heyo

      Before I start using this blog to dive deeply into the world of enterprise class business intelligence solutions, Microsoft, computer games, Wazzu athletics and general geekdom that constitute my female deprived existence, an interesting thought:  The movie "8 Mile" ( a semi-based-on-a-real-story tale of a young white rapper, played by EMINEM, trying to spit lyrics in the disturbingly impoverished outskirts of Detroit) has a interesting insight into happiness and conquering poverty. The moral of the story, as I see it, is if you life blows - try gambling. Bingo to be exact. See, Slim Shady's mom is a heroin addict looking lady with out much going for her. And her son is getting his lunch handed to him at work, on the mic, and by random dudes he catches boning his girl. But then the incredible happens... Shady's mom wins big at bingo. The family is happy. The movie ends on a high note.  When your down and out put all your money on the table at the local YMCA bingo parlor and God will do the rest.
