      This is a poem about growing up Latino in America, speaking two languages, living two lives, and trying to embrace a culture that doesn't embrace your native culture. It is a great look inside the mind of a Latino boy who is struggling with discrimation, poverty, and peer fighting.   The poet uses powerful descriptions of the "white" and "ethnic" sides of the tracks to set the tone for the poem. It is centered around 2 brothers sneaking across the artificial boundary of the "tracks" to buy groceries for their mother from a high end market. Along their journey, the brothers encounter a group of "white" boys their age and older and are beaten up for being Latino and for entering their neighborhood. The fight scene is graphically illustrated with lines like " a splattering head of soup" and "he slid from their grasp like a rotten banana." In that moment, these words made me feel ashamed to be an American.   Racism in all its froms needs to be combatted. Maybe if everyone read more poetry and exposed themselves to different ideas, ethnicities and cultures, discrimination would become a thing of the past.

      This is a poem by Naomi Shihab Nye that juxtaposes peace and war in Palestine. The poet provides commentary on how bombing schools and stifling laughter have replaced a time in Palestine when "Once singing would rise/in sweet sirens over the hills". It is a sad, melancholy poem with a valuable lesson to teach. It illustrates the devastation of war on a civilization through focusing on daily rituals, celebrations, greetings and pastimes. And at its core is the reality of ethnic and religious tensions that perpetuate discrimination throughout the world.

      My Fathers sit on benches their flesh counts every plank the slats leave dents of darkness deep in their withered flanks.  They nod like broken candles all waxed and burnt profound they say "It's understanding  that makes the world go round."  There in those pleated faces I see the auction block the chains and slavery's coffles the whip and lash and stock.  Ny Fathers speak in voices that shred my fact and sound they say "It's our submission that makes the world go round."  They used the finest cunning their naked wits and wiles  the lowly Uncle Tomming and Aunt Jemima's smiles.  The've laughed to shield their crying then shuffled through their dreams and stepped 'n' fetched a country to write the blues with screams.  I understand their meaning it could and did derive from living on the edge of death They kept my race alive.  (From  The Complete Poems of Maya Angelou)   urlLink
