      So the name of this blog pretty much sums it up. It's incredibly confusing for a 23 year old who has never had to deal with the difference between a PPO and an HMO before. Never before have I been so concerned with whether or not my PCP was In-Network. This whole book I've been reading for the last hour and a half has more dumb abbreviations and acronyms out the wazoo that I can't believe it. I mean I read scientific papers day in and day out and I thought those were dry and boring. Let me tell you, if you ever need anything to put you to sleep read through the all legal and financial crap that your health care provider sends to you with the hope of you getting ill and spending money. What a society we live in...I mean maybe I'm being to pessimistic here but it kind of frightens me that there are these huge (HUGE) companies out there making millions and millions of dollars by exploiting the sick. Ok, so exploiting may be a little bit of a strong word, but still, it may just be a step below that (or maybe I'm just sick of reading all this garbage).

      One of the biggest stuggles I've had thus far in my life has been trying to reconcile the fact that a good God allows evil to take place in a world he has created and must have full control over (if we are to admit that he is fully omnipotent and sovereign).  John Piper put it this way:  "How could God be happy and decree calamity? Consider that he has the capacity to view the world through two lenses: through the narrow one he is greived and angered by sin and through the wide one he sees evil in relation to its iternal purpose. Reality is like a mosaic. The parts may be ugly in themselves, but the whole is beautiful."  I guess one other way to look at this is simply that God gave His only son to die for us. He knew that what would happen before hand. How could he be good and let this happen? This question has puzzled and infuriated me for the past several months. Any comments would be welcome, but simply put...I guess God saw that without Christ's death for us we could not truly be redeemed. He looked past the sin, past the evil, and saw that in the end it was good. I can't truly believe in my heart and mind that God would ever do something or let something happen that would ultimately lead to the frustration of his purposes.

      In my humble and as of yet inexperienced opinion, transitions seem to be the most troublesome portions of life. The provide the most excitement and the most anxiety all at the same time. I wonder what it is about these parts of our lives that do this for us? Take right now for example, I've been married for a little over 3 weeks and don't get me wrong being married is great, but it's much different than I ever could have imagined it to be. Not in a bad way at all, but in a way that I didn't expect none the less, that being that things aren't really as different as I thought they'd be at all. I wake up in the morning after my wife (and before this, girlfriend of three years), has left the house and gone to school to teach the juniors and seniors statistics and I eat my breakfast of generic cereal (since we can't afford general mills and all that good stuff ) and then I take a shower and get ready for the day to begin. Then I head off to lab where I do the work I'm supposed to do and then I come home 10 or 12 hours later. It seems a drab life to me and somewhere deep inside of me I long for so much more than that. I guess I thought I'd find it in marriage. There is a quote by Leo Tolstoy in a letter that he had written to his son and in it Tolstoy states that marriage is not two people finding happiness in each other but rather two people being together to draw themselves clower to God. I think I understand now what Tolstoy was talking about. Marriage in itself is a great thing, one of the best, but marriage and love here on earth is not the end all and be all, it merely reflects the love God has for us and the love we should have for Him. I don't think there was one person that was made for just us, however I think that there are a great number of people that we could be happy with. I think that the choices we make in our lives that shape us direct us down a certain road and then eventually we see this one person who in our eyes is perfect, and loves us in a way that makes us understand, if only for a moment, what God's love is like. That's how I feel about my wife. She loves me completely without reservations, regardless of how she  feels . I think that last bit is important because it proves that love is more than an emotion. It is a commitment to love one another, to be faithful to one another, and for my wife and I to reprove one another's faults in order to mold each other more into the likeness of Christ. I heard it once said that marriage is like a rock tumbler. When you begin marriage both people have a considerable amount of rough edges, but as you continue to weather out the storms of marriage and love each other continually, you begin to wear off the edges of the other until that person is smooth and without a blemish...
