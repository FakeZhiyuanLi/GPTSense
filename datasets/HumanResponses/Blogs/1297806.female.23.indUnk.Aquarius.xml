      Finally sorted out the problem that was troubling me. Alls well that ends well. Life is good again. No tensions. Had a major hang over after team lunch. Havent eaten so much my whole life. Couldnt eat anything for days. Was wondering what it would be like to go on an indefinte fast. What would happen to all those little cells inside my body. How would they react!! What would be going in their nucleii. Not biologically but physcologically. Ok I am blaberring again....

      Well I guess i havent been posting anything for quite sometime now. Dont know if that has been because I was busy or because I didnt want to write anything. Life has been a little complicated for quite sometime now. Something is definitely bothering me but cant actually pinpoint what. I am not enjoyong my work. I think I need to think it over and identify what is it thats causing all the trouble. Had gone for team lunch. Wonder why people celebrate it when they get married. I mean what is it that they are gaining after all. Arent they losing their freedom and getting bound to one person. Beats me!!! Maybe I will know if and when I get married. ;-)) Guess I should get back to work now.

      Buenos Dias, Well life goes on as usual. Working on something which is becoming more and more confusing. Didnt play Holi for the first time in my life :(( Wanted to but then we were just 5 of us and didnt see a point in playing in such a small group. Holi is one festival where its more enjoyable to play with as many people as possible. A couple of my friends did come and put some colors on me. That was Holi for me ;-) India is all set to crack world cup semi finals. It would be nice to see them win the cup this time around though Australia is a better team.

      Well today has been one of the most confusing days of my life in TI. We have been so confused with what we are working on and there doesnt seem to be any solution anywhere in sight. Have been trying to contact various people and but noone seems to be the right person to be contacted. Looks like India is going to win the match. Good for them!!!

      I am back again. I am thrilled in life. I got some stuff from home. Lots of Shrikhand. Had that for lunch ;-) Was just thinking, what does it mean to really hate something. I  mean its not that I have never hated anyone or anything ever but guess my hatred never reached a stage where I would really want bad things to happen to the one concerned. I think I really want to see that negative side of me where I would want terrible things to happen to what I hate ;-)  Kenya won the match and I really hated that but then I didnt want terrible things to happen to Kenya. Well guess when one genuinely hates something one would want to be as mean as possible. Does that mean I have never genuinely hated something? Does it mean that none of my feelings are genuine? May be thats too much of an extrapolation.Let me remain happy with the (mis?)conception that only my ill feelings are not genuine ;-)

      Buenos Dias, What a beginning. No mails in my inbox, thats one thing which simply spoils my mood. Have loads of work to do. These days I am getting this feeling that I am like one of those extras in a play, one who is required to be there but the presence doesnt particularly lend any meaning to the play. I mean it can be anyone doing that part. So my own contribution is insignificant, another person would have done it equally well.Dont know lets see when will I get promoted to a more significant role.

      I am getting irritated today. We are supposed to go for a trip and noone wants to even think logically. They all are  behaving in such an immature manner. I am giving up on the trip. Losing all the enthu... Anyways we are supposed to have one last meeting today if nothing is decided today I think I will not go for the trip. What a painful thing...

      Well wonder why certain things happen when they are not meant to be in the first place.But they still happen and hurt you because they were not meant to happen. Beats me. Have tried to find a reason to avoid such things to happen but guess its finally not in our hands. I mean if they were in our hands they wouldnt be classified as things which happen which are not meant to be in the first place. Anyways life is too confusing to be sorted out like this I guess.

      Well i think I took a really long break. Well lots of not so important things kept me busy. Well finally made a decision to do MBA. Realised the reason behind my dissatisfaction. I want to be in-charge and that can be attained only if I have power, authority. And that means management ;-)))

      Today there was a lot of excitement in our group. We are going for a day's outing on 31st to Club Cabana(http://www.clubcabanaindia.com/). So everyone was planning out games and things to do. Someone came up with this idea of giving surprise gifts to each other. We all picked up one slip with the name of a teammate written on it. We are not supposed to tell whose name we got and we have to buy a gift for that person now. Since I have recently moved to this group I dont know people very well. One person from my previous group has also joined along with me. And guess what I got his name. Thankfully , atleast I know him pretty well. I hate to give a gift to a person without knowing the person. I mean its so sad. A gift should be given keeping the other person's likes and dislikes in mind. I mean I wouldnt like someone gifting me a cassette or a CD of some ROCK BAND. (I know lots of you would frown on that) If I dont like getting something I dont like I am sure others dont too.

      Yesterday was a very hectic day. Got up at around 9am (well thats a bit too early for me on a holiday) and got ready in half an hour. Went to Fab India. Man that place does have some really cool stuff. Bought some stuff for parents and sis, went to Art of Living Ashram outside Bangalore. That place is amazingly peacful. Well I guess most  of the people who claim to have got benefit from Art of Living course, must have got the same from the very stay in that place. Its so beautiful and close to nature that anyone will forget his worries and feel relaxed. Anyways, went to ISKCON temple after that.  The place was overflowing with people. Didnt have the strength to actually climb those stairs so decided to wait for my parents in the car. Came back home and slept like a baby. I like the feeling. When one is tired, very tired . The feeling one gets is just awesome.  Dad is leaving bangalore today. Its going to be just me and mom for sometime now. Not too sure if I am happy about it. After having lived away from parents for over 5 years now, I am not too comfortable when they are around. I mean its good for a couple of days, but then I start longing for all that independence which I have when I am all by myself.  Am I being too selfish?

      Feeling a lot better today. Guess it was just some weakness which was causing me all thos weird feelings. Anyways came late to office. There is nothing like sleeping as much a you can. Well have you ever felt that amazing feeling you get when you wake up and then know that there is nothing much to do the whole day :) Well ever since i have changed my group i havent been doing any work what so ever :) Come to office, think of ways to waste time and go back home. Man thats life :) My parents are here these days. Its a nice change. I dont have to do anything :) Get up, get nice food, come to office, relax again and then go back home to have another nice meal, and then sleep. But then as they say all good things come to an end, guess soon work will start and my parents will also leave. Hehehe, Bhagwan jab deta hai to chappad phaad ke deta hai aur jab  leta hai to bas phir kya hai :) Adios. PG

      Havent been feeling too well for past 4 days now. Have this weird feeling in my limbs and am feeling quite breathless today. Hope I dont have anything serious going on inside my body. Well for the firt timers, I am a highly paranoid person. A small infection causes me to think about it for hours together till I have got all kinds of tests done on myself to make sure it really is a small infection and nothing else. So now you can imagine what this kind of uneasiness is doing to me right now :) Well got myself checked by a doctor yesterday and she thinks everything is fine but am still not convinced. I am now associating everything that happens to me to this uneasiness in my body. Well guess i need to stop thinking for sometime. Maybe everything is because I am being paranoid." Well as they say its all in the mind"

      Hi I am back, well i must say it was the longest possible break I could have taken. Well lots seem to have happened in life in all these months. Both on personal and professional front. Well I would keep this blog more of not so personal kinda thing since I dont like to discuss every micro detail of my life so openly. Anyways our group, the one in which I was working for almost 18 months closed down and i have been shifted to this new group. A nice small group though work hasnt really started yet. Have  been doing a lot of reading and a lot of timepass. Well think its enough for today. Will make it more interesting from tomorrow (hopefully :))

      Well I had decided I wont post any blog for a long time to come. Reason? Well I am not too sure if its worth the effort. I mean why am I even maintaining one? Its doesnt come even 0.01% close to having a personal diary. I mean personal diary is close to someone's heart. Its one place where you mention your deepest, darkest secrets and noone absolutely noone can read it. Blog is, on the other hand, exact opposite. One writes stuff which absolutely anyone can read. What is the intention? Write stuff so that others can read? or what. Anyways I am not convinced yet and will not  write till I am convinced. Bye

      Well well well. One day I dont update my blog and I have so many people requesting me to do the same :) Hehehehe. Well our trip to club cabana was a great success. We played a lot of games, ate good food and got good presents. I got a photo frame cum wall clock. Very cute thing. Wonder who gave it to me. Weekend was a lazy one. Didnt do much. Slept most of the time. Mom's leaving tomorrow. So helped her to pack her stuff. Kinda relieved that she is leaving. Well not happy, guess i have not become that mean yet. I guess I am not totally dead inside. A teammate has moved into a new house. Went to her place for lunch. Man I am waiting for the day, when I would move into MY OWN HOUSE. A house, which I will decorate with my own hands. I have decided to make a room in my house, which I would even paint myself. That room is going to be my own creation. Anyways, guess work will finally start today. Art of Living course starts tomorrow. Have heard a lot about it. Lets see how it turns out to be.

      Well, I think I can update my blog once in a while. Its not that bad a thing to do :)  Today's post is not mine. Its taken from Som's blog and somehow I feel it fits.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ They know. You know. They know that you know. You know that they know. But they don't say so. So you don't either. And they go on acting natural. So you do the same. Nothing unnatural in the whole thing. As if nothing is different. But what's wrong if things are different? Different is not wrong. Different is not something to hide. So why all this play-acting? Why can't I declare aloud that I know, so speak to me without this deception, this mask?  And what good comes out of it all? A realisation. I thought I was their friend. I thought that they would tell me about it...something important. They didn't. I wasn't as close to them as I thought. So even if they know, and I know, and all of us know that the other knows, this must go on. Till they take the first step to change things. Will they? I do not know.

      Just wanted to write the following  poem. A poem  I have read a million times. A poem I think is a masterpiece. So powerful in its meaning yet so simple in its words.  "The Road not  taken"           Robert Frost  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference

      The demon has resurfaced. She is  a very nice person.  I have spend some really happy moments with her but now the very look of her pains me. Is it something she did? Cant think of anything which could have triggered such a feeling.  Passing phase. Thats what everyone tells me. But deep down I know its not. It all seems so familiar. Has happened before. Not long back.  I am sacred to even think about it.  Is this the end?No.  I won't repeat the mistakes I made before. I won't. I won't let the demon win this time.

      Back from Mumbai. The trip was good. I guess I took Ashish's comment of relaxing way too seriously. Slept like a maniac. I am sure my parents got an impression that I work way too much out here to get any sleep ... hehehehe No matter what, I still fell so much comfortable in that colony of ours. Its like my own. I guess that's because I have spend most of the time there. I met some of my old friends. After almost an year. It was great. Everyone seems to have changed a bit. Some for good. Its nice to see those people who had such naive and narrow opinions opening up to the realities of the world. Or is it that I have changed and that's why I perceived them differently. Whatever it may have been. It was a good balance.  But there is one thing which I have been thinking ever since I came back. Infact I was talking to a friend of mine about it. She brought up a very interesting point. She said, we change when we stay away from our parents. We find it different when we go back home now. We feel a bit weird. Is it the same for our parents? Do they feel a bit different when we are around after such long periods of time? I always used to think that parents never change. But after she brought up this point, I was a little confused. Isn't it that they also settle down in a kind of a routine which is altered when we come down. I wonder....

      I had got my PAN number. But they never sent me my PAN card as promised. And when I called them up to find out the reason, they didnt have any convincing answer. I had to reapply for the card. And again fill all those thousand forms and submit hundreds of documents. Man these people are pathetic. Why cant they be more efficient and have a better process in place. I guess they are the ones who need all these ISO, CMM certifications. Though considering the way things have becoming, I really doubt if anything will change the scenario.

      Damn. Something is terribly wrong with my blog. When I view it in Netscape I see a huge font. It covers most of the window and I am not even able to see the links to my archives and all. If I see it in IE, for one of the archives it shows me my previous template and a lot of junk. I have lost all the comments to my previous posts :(  Thanks Gaurav for pointing this out. Man , does anyone know why this is happening? I am not too conversant with html and all.  Anyways, have been thinking a lot of late. About what is it that I want in life and deep down inside me I have realized I am not the kind of person I thought I was. I am not so strong as I thought I was. I am not the Prerna I thought I was. And believe me thats one hell of a scary feeling. I mean suddenly you realize that you are not what you should have been. Maybe I knew this all along but was scared to accept it. Maybe we all know. Maybe we all actually are not the people we think we are.

      Well today happens to be a compensatory working saturday. Man so much for making up for the loss of productivity. 50% of the people havent turned up.Most of the remaining people came in late and are either chatting, or surfing the net. In my whole team, we are just 4 out of 25 people who have turned up for work (???)... Man thats what compensatory working days are for :):).. Compensating for lost surfing times, missed out laccha sessions and sleep :))

      Havent been able to blog for quite sometime now. Almost a month I must say. Well no particular reason. Just was busy with this and that. Well the latest from my end is that I shifted to a new house. I simply love this place. Its the best house I have lived in ever since I came to bangalore. I am so thrilled. I am not a big cleanliness freak, but believe me I have been taking extra care in making sure that nothing is messed up. I wonder if I am like this in a rented house what would it be like when I have my own. I am just waiting for it. Finally, managed to put my snaps online too. The link is http://albums.photo.epson.com/j/AlbumList?u=4218129.  Have realized that suddenly I have become quite a satisfied person. Very unlike me. I used to a person who wanted so much more out of life. I am not sure if thats a good thing or bad. On one hand its good to be satisfied as it gives so much peace of mind, on the other hand, it leads to stagnation in growth.  Not too sure which way to go.. Not that I have stopped aspiring for things, but I dont get too disappointed if I dont get those. Guess need to do a bit of thinking on that...
