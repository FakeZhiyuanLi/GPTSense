      Last winter I decided to take another bike tour.  A friend decided he could manage the time off from work so we cut the trip down in time and we had our plans. We flew out of Asheville NC into Newark. Landing in Amsterdam we put our bikes together and headed towards town.  From the airport we ended up riding about 45 miles into the Centre'.  I had arranged a place to stay on the Amstel river.  After getting all set up we headed to a coffee shop, first things first! We were able to catch a canal tour our first evening there and it was spectacular.  Walking back to our place I suggested going to the red light district.  I had read so many books with the district being described and I wanted to check it out.  Before I could realize what was happening; we were in the red light district.  We did the tourist things, Rembrandt, Anne Frank house tour, shopping and sight seeing.  The streets had the faint aroma of weed, beer and sweat.  It was an international holiday and so many Europeans were traveling for the long weekend. We packed up our belongings and headed to the train station to leave for Switzerland.  I had booked a train so we could sleep on the train that night. Arriving in Switzerland around 9 am we were able to find a good place to stay and it was across from a bike shop.  I was going to need to switch out my clips on my shoes because I forgot to set them for my Kona NuNu converted touring bike pedals.   Our night in Geneva was great.  Good sights, good food and a great nights rest.  The next morning we packed up and walked ove to the bike shop were the owner changed our route due to the climbs and all of our weight being carried.  He instantly became our friend and mapped out our route city by city, town by town on our map. We headed towards St Julien where the Swizz/French boarder is located.  The ride was slighlty challenging due to the traffic, road construction and heavy rains.  We road 37 miles and passed into France.  Once we entered into France the sun came out and we climbed gradually through rolling towns until we to our last pass.  The next 27 miles were all down hill.  Quite cold we dropped into a town called Fragny.  I call it "Fragel Rock".  This town was something from the 1700's.  It's tiny roads led us through so many cobble stone roads and homes.  We took a road out to a local camping. The rain became steadily harder so we were ready to call it a day.  At the camping a old white headed French woman ran out of the main cabin.  She insisted in French that we stay in her small trailer not in our tent. Reluctantly I agreed.  But for 5 euros I got a dry roof and room to move around.  We changed and headed to town to eat a fondu restaraunt.  We drank wine and ate cheese with bread. My travelling partner was not use to eating so heavily, it was very interesting food in Northern France. The next morning we headed Seysell.  We rode about 55 miles untill we came to a town called Culoz.  This is where I am about 99.9% sure we saw Lance Armstrong on a round about.  Our friends have put doubt in our heads but if it wasn't him, the Postal clothes wearing cyclist sure looked like a freshly head shaved Lance.  He looked directly at me from 2 feet away and said,"Bonjour American." Go Lance! Actually go Karen!  We rode another 28 miles through belley thinking we were going to eat and sleep in Aoste.  We thought worng. We had another 10 miles to ride and it was all up hill.  We made it to Abrets to the center of town.  it was completely empty.  Savoy was the hotel and the owner agreed that the bikes could be parked in the side lobby.  he insisted we eat right away since he knew how tired and hungry we were but also because the kitchen was closing.  It was one of the best meals.  Of course we ate bread and drank wine but the main dish was fish, veggies and cous cous like grain.  The dessert put me over the edge and we slept through the night. That morning we awaoke to loud noises all around us.  We opened our windows and the once quiet town was rocking with activity.  The circus de Paris was coming through the center of town! We packed and headed out.  We rode 32 miles into Voiron and the weather beat us down.  More climbing into the head winds and the rain picked up again.  Both of us decided to go shopping in a really cool town.  That evening we ate early and got more sleep. The next morning we rode 40 miles through some great towns.  Winding our way through some spectacular scenery.  The poppies were out and the wildflowers were so beautiful. We decided after looking at the forecast and a map that we would catch a train in Grenoble and head towards the coast to warmer weather. The train ride dropped us in Marseille. We had to sneak our bikes on the train.  Apparently the ticket person sold me the wrong tickets for our bikes but it was the last train we could get on that day.  I became friends with the ticket guy on the train and he worked it out for us and even gave us a cabin so we could sleep.  Sneaking bikes on a train is not too easy.  It was midnight so we found a hotel and I ate at McDonalds.  It felt disgusting but my body was craving FAT.  Not spending much time in Marseille, it reminded me of NYC before Guliane was Govenor.  It smelled like a toliet but it was historic and beautiful none the less. We rode 57 miles towards Nice and the coastal riding was already proving its challenges.  the roads were tricky and narrow.  Climbing up out of the towns and out around the inlets.  i was digging the wrm weather and the view of the Mediterrane'e was perfect! I crashed a few times because of the sidewalk riding.  The wall next to us was about 1 inch from my handlebars and the drop off on the roadside was about three feet. We roade towards Monoco and Monte Carlo.  Both of these port cities emboidred with so much history and million dollar boats.  It was breathtaking. We decided to go on into Italy that evening.  As the sun set we crossed the Italian border.  Winding and climbing through tunnels.  We stayed in a great place on the beach.  We went on a night hike across the jettis up to this castle.  It was a great time.  The food on the coast was much easier to ride on than the heavier food up north.  I fell in love with the seafood spagetti.   We rode on through San Remo, Genova, and Livorno. Then we decidded to jump a train.  We got closer to Rome and rode our way straight up to the Colosseo and Old Rome.  We found a place in town and headed out to an early dinner and some shopping.  The next morning my friend awoke with flu like symptoms and unfortunately spent the next several days in bed.  I was able to tour the city and catch the history.  In the evenings I would find amazing places to eat, drink and read.  I fell in love with Rome.  It was interesting to see the political tagging about BUSH.  Politics didn't pose itself as an issue on this trip.  Most folks felt badly that we were at this mans Mercy.  The majority hate the war and bush.  Don't worry they still love Amrica, what it stands for and the people.  I only had one run in with a quadrpelgic wheelchair bound man in Switzerland.  He was French and asking me for direction.  With my little knowledge of french he basically called me a nasty American.  He was a grumpy ASS! So we packed our bags and headed to the train station.  It was as easy this time and we were not allowed on the train.  my friend was still really sick and we had to ride 45 miles to another town to jump a train towards Fiumicino.  Once we arrived we were suppose to have boxes at the airport for our bikes.  I had arranged this prior to our arrival.  The airport staff sent us to Cargo a few miles away.  Unfortunately they had no idea what we were talking about but after a hour of hunting some friends down they got us motorbike boxes and we packed our bikes up for the flight home.  We headed to the airport with our boxes and bags and slept on the floor upon our thermarest. The next morning we realized we were a day early.  Our newly found friends at Continental had gottenan ear full from me about the flight over, the boxes and the service in general so we were upgraded.  We got our flight changes and we loaded the plane.  The flight home seemed quicker that the flight over.  A sleeping pill goes a long way on a long flight!
