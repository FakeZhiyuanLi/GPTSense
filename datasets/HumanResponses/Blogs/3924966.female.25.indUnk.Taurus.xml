       It was Otik's second time to come here to the office to sell jewelries. I never had any plan of buying another one, but alas! the luster of gold was simply irresistable. I have bought a tri-color,italian 14k, 3.6 grams, heart bracelet to match the earrings I bought from her last visit. It may be a little expensive but at least I bought something with value. A good way to invest my newly acquired positional allowance.. hehehe =D Since my brother is already working and paying for his law school is off my shoulders already (well not yet really for i'm still paying for my coop loan),I can now enjoy the fruits of my labor in a glittering fashion. =D    While selecting Otik's goods, I could see the happiness and excitement in my girl-friends' eyes.While fitting the jewelries I'd often hear them say  "Ay, maganda siya, pero ndi ko pa na fefeel sa heart ko na gusto ko cya" .. funny it may sound but well it's a known fact that women use their emotions not only when choosing the man of their dreams but also even the simplest things like a jewelry.(That's why it takes us a century to dress up, kasi ndi pa namin feel! Ok?) And when they finally find the one they like you'd usually hear,  "Hay wow, I am really so happy!" .  So who says diamonds are a girl's bestfriend?  Well not yet for now, coz we still can't afford it. Actually I originally fancied the white gold, diamond studed Eternity ring Otik brought last week, but the whooping P11,000 ring just hurts the pocket. Maybe when I become the richest one among the barkada after 10 years (according to 'Spin The Bottle'), Maybe then I will finally see my ring finger with my dream Eternity ring with matching Tiffany and Co. wedding band.. hehehehe..But for the moment, I will just have to settle with the gold earrings and bracelet which nonetheless made me happy.  As they say, "Choose the ones you love the most.." but for now it would be "Choose the ones you can afford more..".

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reading my girl friends' blogs, and I couldn't agree more with Claire, men topic always gets a space in our blogs. From bitter feelings to kilig moments, men have their way on injecting dosage of emotional roller coaster into a woman's life. And I bet they don't even have a teeny-weenie hint about it.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a saying that goes, "Behind a successful man is a beautiful woman.." comes another, "Behind a woman's blog is an insensitive man."      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gone are the days of colorful diaries where we keep dried roses in between the scented pages of love and frustrations(and more frustrations). Gone are the days when we cry in one corner and hoping that the love of our lives would notice us and hopefully(fingers crossed) ask us what was wrong so we could answer our famous "Nothing!" and hopefully again(fingers crossed again) they would start thinking why (which most of the time they won't).    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 21st century women now have blogs for our 21st century insensitive men who are now more busy with work(really?) or ogling over Viva Hot Babes' boobies, NBA Games, Boy's night out, Magic and the most famous computer games.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is deficiency in human sensibility actually natural in men? Are women really hard to comprehend? or is it men are just too lazy to perceive us?    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It just amazes me how well men deceive us during courtship. They'd give you flowers and chocolates in daily or weekly basis. They'd text and call you every minute just to say "hi" or "you're always on my mind". They'd figuratively swim across the atlantic just to see you. And the most mystifying of all, they would literally miss the NBA finals or a computer game just to spend time with you. And when you've finally felt like a real Juliet and have fallen into the trap, your ever so sensitive Romeo will transform into  Pinochio  (more dangerous because his nose won't grow everytime he lies), or  Peter Pan  (who refuses to grow old) or  Frodo  (whom you'd never hear from again because he suddenly got an important mission to save middle earth) or even  The Frog Prince , instead this time the handsome Prince will turn into a frog.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the time when we will start to complain and waste enormous time wondering like the Black Eyed Peas' famous question: "Where is the Love?". And all we get is a blank faced "andyan ka nanaman, nag ddrama ka naman." or "hay mga babae talaga" or "bakit? meron ba sa iyo ngayon?". Guys, we only have monthly period every month (that's why it's called monthly ok) and if you find your girl grumpy and not talking to you almost everyday or everyweek, then something's definitely wrong. So toss your 'manly' insensitivity aside and try practicing your interpersonal skill enshrouded beneath your childish ways.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women may be gifted with patience but we can only bear too much. So before we reach our boiling point and before you catch yourself drop-jawed asking "Why?" and "What happened?" start asking her now, talk to her and actually listen. Better yet, read her blogs and read between the lines before it's too late. Maybe along the way, you'll also realize that women are actually not that hard to figure out.

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sexual position that is a surefire hit to drive any man crazy in bed (just one of the few tricks that you can do). It also gives a certain satisfaction to women because it gives them control and it's an easier way to strike the spot.   Try mastering this craft with a little bit of this and that, and you'll have your man on his knees begging for more.&nbsp;         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not another run-of-the-mill version of a Carrie Bradshaw's Sex and The City article. Nor am I going to talk about  'sexcapades' .I just want to illustrate to you the irony of a controversial issue on who should be incharge in a relationship.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men want their women on top and in control while they just lay there waiting for glory but try taking that control outside the bedroom, and you will never hear the end of it. During heated arguments, when all patience have been exhausted, I'd always hear the phrases: "Please just stop talking and just do what I say, I am the man", and "You're the woman, you're supposed to submit to me.", like it is the solution to every problem. (Like it will make my mouth shut).&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is submission really the be-all and end-all of a woman's existence?      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's been a hundred years since the Maria Clara days when surrendering to men&nbsp;was part of every woman's syllabus. Women don't wear baro't saya under the heat of the sun anymore, we now wear tube tops, tank tops, shortie shorts and micro-minis. Women nowadays don't have to drop a hankie to catch men's attention, we get a boob job instead.. hehehe.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess submission is like respect, men have to earn it. I am no ordinary woman. I am educated, I earn my own money, I can basically provide for my needs, and most of all I have my own mind. So for women like me, it takes something more for us to depend on men. He has to be strong, physically and mentally.&nbsp;He should be able to stand and fight for me if&nbsp;I being put down. He should be able to carry an intelligent conversation with me. He&nbsp;has to be more passionate and driven than I am. He should be able to provide for me more than what I can provide for myself. He should make&nbsp;me feel that I can't live without him.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever i'll be lucky enough to find  'My Man' , maybe in my next relationship I'll be able to make a compromise. I'll let him call the shots during the day and I'll learn to be his woman on top at night. ;p

          In the middle of work, Maila suddenly sent me a net&nbsp;message of Gary V's "How Did You Know" lyrics. I thought she was going crazy or it's just an effect of her insomia. But actually, she was just feeling&nbsp;melancholic.. (oh what boredom do to people!). She shared to me her feeling of emptiness, loneliness and that she wants to find that elusive 'The One'. It's been&nbsp;two years when her longtime boyfriend died so I understand her need to feel that love again. I saw how her world revolved around Pio, the small and big sacrifices she'd made, like when she wouldn't come to our gimmiks because she had to go home early to cook for him and I saw how her heart died with him. The good news is she is now healed and her heart is now&nbsp;ready to take another lease of life. But the problem is it seems so hard to find that someone who will make her feel really alive again. or in a scientific term: "The One".     &nbsp;   Maila is not alone. I know there are many who are Waiting, Hoping and Wishing. That someday, somewhere they will finally&nbsp;meet that someone.     &nbsp;   But the biggest question of all is: &nbsp;When is someday? Where is somewhere?     &nbsp;   The answer is one of life's greatest mystery. I bet Albert Einstein&nbsp;and Aristotle died without knowing the answer.     &nbsp;   But I have formulated a hypothesis for that (hey i'm not trying to outdo the two geniuses here ok). Why not use your precious time reaching for your dreams?&nbsp;instead of sitting there, sulking, or desperately collecting and running after someone who would be a potential "The One".     &nbsp;   My dears, the world revolves, life goes on even without you. So don't get&nbsp;caught standing still. Walk to the road of your dreams, and who knows, the man of your dreams might be along the way.     &nbsp;   Isn't it fabulous that when 'someday' comes, you're already a fulfilled person and ready to tackle another challenge of sharing your life with someone. Sharing yourself with someone is not an easy task. It&nbsp;becomes much more&nbsp;difficult when you still have an 'unfinished business' hanging with you. Because being with someone means creating a whole new dream together.     &nbsp;   I think I am basing these thoughts with my own experience. My mom married early. She thought she already found 'the One' at age 18. It's hard growing up with a mom who is busy establishing&nbsp;her career and reaching for her&nbsp;American dream. Yep, she worked hard and&nbsp;was able to work and tour around US. But she had to pay the price&nbsp;of being away from her family for a long time.&nbsp;For mom and dad have different dreams, my dad never liked&nbsp;the idea of going there.&nbsp;So&nbsp;half of my life, I never had a mother around me and&nbsp;while growing up, I've harbored hate for her. All for her dream. (I think it's easier to accept if my parents are really separated). Until now I'm still wondering if what she did was worth it. I never knew, but what I learned is, I will never want that to happen to me or to my future family.     &nbsp;   So instead of waiting to death, treat this time as a blessing and a chance to make yourself to what you really want to become. Look at the other side of the coin, not everybody is given this kind of&nbsp;opportunity.     To make life easier to bear, embrace the fact that finding 'The One'&nbsp;is and will&nbsp;forever remain a mystery,&nbsp;you may&nbsp;end up not finding it&nbsp;but at least you did something good for someone who is much more worthy of&nbsp;your time and love than anyone else... and that&nbsp;someone is  YOU .     &nbsp;    &nbsp;     &nbsp;

       I had a busy weekend. Last friday my girl friends and I went to Neo-Neo for dinner, watched Liberated 2 (very lousy movie) and 'tambay' at C24. But before our gimmick, we had a heart to heart talk.. a.k.a "open forum",&nbsp;i know it's too childish at our age but hey, we did it at the conference room so there's still a touch of maturity there huh. =D It was all because, one of us got mad or had a tampo against the rest of us, because.. she wasn't informed about the badminton game last thursday..yes we are all 25 years old and above...hehehe.. but anyway, it came out that it wasn't just about the badminton game, there were other issues (so u can't judge us as childish) but everything's ironed out now. thank god!     &nbsp;   But anyway, going back to my busy weekend. My weekends have been loaded since I became officially single. It's funny when I recall myself 4 years ago, I made a promise that I will never have a boyfriend again&nbsp;until I turn 25 (I just came out of a very, very bad and traumatic first love relationship). Now I just turned 25, and I don't have a boyfriend because I just got out of a 4-year relationship. But for me, this is the best year of my life so far. It's because this is the only time I really appreciated my 'singlehood'.&nbsp;       I used to believe that&nbsp;having someone who loves you and the "security" that someday you'll be married are the only important things in a woman's life. But now I realized that loving yourself is more important thing to learn.   I am not being narcissist here, but what's the use of that "security" when you're forever pretending to be happy?&nbsp;When your self-esteem and confidence&nbsp;are being dragged down the bottomless pit? When you've stop dreaming?     &nbsp;   But being alone has its downside too, for one i miss the holding hands , the hugs&nbsp;and&nbsp;the kisses. When I get sick, no one would drive me to the doctor anymore, no one would bring me food, no one&nbsp;would cook&nbsp;for me (i miss my favorite Sinigang). If I get scared in the middle of the night, i've no one to call to and come&nbsp;over my house even if it's already 2 in the morning (and so that's how i learn to sleep alone).     &nbsp;   However, being single has its rewards that could more than make up for it. I can go anywhere, anytime with anyone. My social life has never been so alive. I've got more friends now, girls and guys.&nbsp;I have gone to&nbsp;more new places.&nbsp;I can shop til I drop&nbsp;without anyone bugging me. I can wear my sexy clothes&nbsp;without making someone's blood pressure rise up.&nbsp;And most of all, I can dream now.       &nbsp;   I am an independent,&nbsp;single woman with the world on my hands. I have my family, friends and career. So there's no reason to rush. I know myself more now and I know what  I  want. I have a clearer idea of the kind of person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I value myself more now that's why I don't&nbsp;wish to waste my&nbsp;time on anyone trying to play around me. They are not worth it and I can say I deserve better than that. If ever I don't find that person, I guess it's alright with me. I have learned it's better to be alone than be with someone you're not happy with (it guess that's how death feels like).     &nbsp;   Being single gives you time to learn from your past mistakes and make yourself a better person.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The best things in life are free! and being single is one of them. =)     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      ftp rec-a user shimanedb enter password mput DataProcessor.* bye *** make all *** trace code debug compile again  Repeat this process until you strain your eyes staring at the computer. That is how I spend my hours at work, and i am even putting up more hours for it on a saturday. I am assigned to do the DataProcessor, the heart of the Nuclear Reactor data Recording system.. but i don't have the heart to do this. I thought I am just going to be involved in this module for the design phase only but as it turned out I am also handling it until the coding. I dread the day I volunteered to be assigned to this module. I was supposed to be in Monitoring system, I am supposed to be using Visual C++ now, I am supposed to be practicing my object oriented programming skill, I am supposed to be working with those cute trainees.. oooppss.. hehehe ;p Kidding aside, i really can't find the interest to do this. I don't know what's wrong, is it me? is it the leader? is the language? I asked to be assigned here because I wanted to avoid having to work with Perfect Guy a.k.a The Shit. I did get what I wanted. We're two modules apart now. I asked the manager during our one on one talk not to make us work together because "I can't take him." and "I don't have any respect left for him anymore.".  So now I have to pay for it by putting up with using C and Linux. Two things I am trying to avoid down the IT road for 4 years.  Now, where can I buy that zest for this? so I can start working now.

      you think i'm shallow, that im just one of them but look deeper than what your eyes can see, uncover me  listen to the weeping swallowed by my endless laughs  feel the pain behind my smiles  you think i'm too strong, that i am unfeeling but listen to me, hear my story know me  discover the fragments that lie beneath the pillars  it doesn't cost a lot to break me  just give me your hand, walk with me along the shore  leave the diamonds behind, let's watch the stars sparkle longer than forever  just spare me some time, dream with me as the sun falls down the horizon  then hug me tight, like i'll be gone tomorrow  when the sunset gets lost in the night, you will see,  that you make me weak... that you make me happy...  just find me, free me, love me.  06/2004 ###################################### first poem i wrote after 5 years.. i thought i'll never write one again. this may be a prelude to a new song...

      Had a meeting with Sir Edward this afternoon about our tasks. I made a list of my tasks and schedule... and to my horror, i realized how mumbo jumbo, hugger-mugger my tasks have become. Not to mention the RRC's filing up on my desk waiting to be arranged. (which reminds me to order new fillers from ma'am Ann)..Damn! so many lags, so little time..tsk, tsk, tsk... i can just imagine my merit rating for this year... tsk, tsk, tsk (have to get out of here). So if my work is in total disarray, what about my life? have to check on that, but maybe i'll worry about that later, after i have compiled my Unit Test codes. On my desks, there are two desk calendars, one with Vic Zhuo's face grinning at me every morning and the other one Albert gave me last christmas. Both are empty. I also have a pretty organizer but it only contained things to buy, bank account numbers, insurance policy number, and birthdays.. but nothing about work schedule. So now I see the problem, 'i am disorganized'.  I'm a type of person who stride in life lightly, too light maybe that I sometimes become oblivious of time (reason why i am always late) and maybe even space. I don't care what the date today is, I even forget my birthday, I remember my ex-boyfriend called me, "The best girlfriend in the world" because unlike other girls, I don't pressure him about our monthsaries or anniversaries. But to be honest, that's because I don't keep track. Funny, one morning Jaja told me, "Hala Ri, di ba 2nd year anniversary nyo ngayon?". Isn't that pathetic, that someone has to remind me of a special date? before i'd go rushing to the nearest bookstore and find the most romantic card available?  That is why I never got interested on the latest models of PDA or Clie, because I know I'll never use it. I'd rather just have an mp3 player so I could listen to music while time pass by me. I just wanted to simplify my life. My cellphone alarm clock is enough to remind me to take vitamins, go to the gym, doctor's appointments, and even about my friends' birthday.  I only dream, I never plan.   My mind can change anytime, anywhere. i may want to eat sushi now but later i'll eat pasta instead. i may bring my workout outfit in the morning but end up shopping and eating (probably if i'm with Georgia ;p) in the afternoon. i may love you now and forget about it one day. So you have to make a beep and remind me why i wait for you or you'll be lost with time.   But still i think i need to change. I think I need to learn how to use my organizer.

      I wasn't productive today, i tried to finish my DataProcessor UT but i had a hard time with my postgres sql... isa pa, wala ako sa mood. bad mood. After office, Maila and I went to Ayala to pay bills and eat dinner. I was supposed to do my grocery but the line was soo long and again, i wasn't in the mood for patience.  So I decided to go home, but i remember I promised Joel Lim to meet him in the chatroom. I may not be in the mood, but i never break promises. =D I thought i'd just drop by for 30 minutes and tell him about my m.cramps that has been bothering me since this morning. But as always when Joel and I start talking, we cannot stop. Kasi he's like Pringles, once he pops, he can't stop. ;D I completely forgot about my cramps, maybe laughter is really the best medicine coz no matter how serious the topic may be, there's always something we could laugh about. Para akong sira ulo sa internet cafe, tawa ako ng tawa.  At first it was me who wanted to ask for his advice, but it turned out he has bigger and more real issues.. hehehe   Thanks joel for bursting my bubbles! You're really a friend! Sorry for the 6 name-calling ;p   I was happy when you reminded me about the things I have that I could be proud of, my good heart, lot of friends and PR. Among the three the first one meant a lot more(yun lang ata ang serious hehehe). You've finally seen more in me than being shallow(as you once said).. hehehe... I hope other people would also see that. Especially those who mean a lot to me.

       I'm still feeling a bit under the weather due to the tonsillitis and fever I suffered during the long weekend that now turned into a  'Sipon' . But I've forgotten about it for a while when my gayfriend recalled to me his sizzling and romantic weekend with this cute guy he met through Friendster. (So who says only straight guys can kiss and tell? huh!). He told me that he could really feel they have this certain connection and that he's really happy and inspired now. Then he dropped the question,  "Ano na ba kami?"  because the cute guy have already asked him if he can promise to be "exclusive" but nothing about being, you know, officially "together". I saw traces of confusion on his glowing face because apparently this is his first time. So I explained to him that he's on a No-Strings-Attached relationship which is a normal thing and actually a very popular one nowadays, not only to the gay community.    It's so easy to draw the line when you see the person only as a friend. But what if you met someone, you discovered that the two of you have this certain connection until he became your "favorite friend". Then one thing leads to another until you find yourself straddling the line between being friends and being a couple. How and when can you rub out the mark that separates love and friendship? And is it right to demand "exclusive right" from that person?  Unlike in a real relationship where protocols are clearly defined, being in a noncommital relationship can be fun yet confusing. For in this side of the fence, there are no rules. Here you can enjoy all the fine things that comes with the real package and the ugly parts are left behind. But sometimes you can be engulfed by your emotions that you start to demand and you start to expect because you tend to forget that after all there are no strings attached. So you have to keep your guards up and remind yourself every now and then that where you are standing on, there is no commitment and at the end of the day you never know you might end up empty handed. So you're only expected to enjoy the ride and you're not supposed to limit yourself to that person, for "exclusiveness" comes only with commitment right? -- But what if you only want him? -- Oh well...as i've said, this can be discombobulating or perplexing.  So what is it with this thing that actually make us agree to stay?  I'm sure my gayfriend is not alone in this field even if the pleasure blinds you from the pain and complications that looms ahead. But unfortunately there are people who are actually just willing to settle in this delusion just to avoid the fear of failure because they can just walk away if things don't work out. Or simply because it's a comfortable arrangement especially to some who can't stay still with one person.  No Strings attached can be very exciting, but time can wear it out and someday you'll find yourself asking the question "Where is this going?". I think that's when the game ends and you have to lay your cards on the table. This is the time you decide whether to take the next step forward or put him back to the other side where he belongs and move on so you can find someone more worthy of your time, who is brave enough to face the commitment that trails along the strings.

            While listening to Butterfly Kisses (Claire's first choice for her bridal march) during lunchbreak, I remember last Saturday when my papa called me up to check on how I was doing, in the middle of our conversation he suddenly asked me,  "Sino daw yung sabi ng mama mo na nanliligaw sa iyo ngayon beng?".  I didn't have any plan of answering his question for I knew it would mean a talk that will never end. So I just changed the topic by asking him what he wanted to have on his birthday and he gave me a funny answer,  "Kahit wala na lang gift, basta wag ka lang mag asawa ha."        My father can be really amusing, I think he has forgotten that his little girl is now 25 years old. Well, Papa is a known playboy back in his younger years and so I understand where his ire for boys, as far as I am concerned, is coming from. (But it could get in my nerves sometimes)   I grew up like Rapunzel locked up in a tower, except that my long curly hair couldn't help me from his watchful eyes. I remember when I was in grade 2, my classmates Victor and Alfred who live in the village invited me go to Kristine's house to play, I told them to wait outside for a while coz I had to ask permission first. When papa found out that I was going out with boys, he forbid me to even go out of the door, so I begged with my futile cry until I fell asleep crying..I didn't know how long Victor and Alfred waited outside our gate that afternoon for they never talked to me after that.   I wasn't spared until highschool, when my kuya's friends(our school heartthrobs) would hangout in the house, I was not allowed to entertain them and I was required to go to my room and hide(kainis!). So just imagine his shock when he accidentally saw me in the mall with 18 guys in tow.(They were just Chinese school basketball varsity teammates of my barkada's boyfriend ok). I bet you already have a picture what happened to me when I got home.   He may be stricter than a regular dad, but it's not all bad memories. There are more times in my life when he made me feel like I am a precious gem in his life. During summer afternoons in our farm in Malalag, he would take me to one part of the road to watch the sun set behind the mountains where buses for General Santos pass. I could no longer remember what the sunset looks like, but I could still feel how happy I was while sitting on his lap listening to his 'bus' stories. Since I didn't have a playmate, he asked Manong Marshal (our family carpenter) to make me a beautiful pink  bahay-bahay  made of bamboo( which he himself cut from the farm), in our backyard. It was so pretty that it looked like a real house complete with little stairs and dining tables. He didn't sleep the night before my debut because he was busy baking and decorating my very beautiful and yummy pink and white, 3-layered cake complete with little satellite cakes for my ninongs and ninangs.   During one of those painful nights, when I was going through my first heartbreak (courtesy of my jerk ex boyfriend in college), he jokingly asked me  "Sinong kaaway sweetheart ko?"  like I was a little girl crying over her broken toy. Then he whispered to me,  "Sabi ko na nga ba sasaktan ka lang ng mga lalaking yan.",  while he hugged me so tightly, it felt like everything will be alright. Until now it melts my heart everytime I remember that night.   Maybe that's the reason why my love for a person could easily wane if he fall short of my expectations. For I haven't found someone yet, who could come close to how my father made me feel extra special. Well, maybe someday when I will finally find that someone, with Butterfly Kisses playing, my father will walk with me down the aisle and hopefully be willing to let go of his little girl.    "With all that I've done wrong I must have done something right to deserve my papa's love every morning..."
