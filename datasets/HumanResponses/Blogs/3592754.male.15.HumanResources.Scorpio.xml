      Yeah, not a lot of updates recently. My brother has been playing his stupid game for 6 hour sessions at a time so I don't get the computer at night, when I usually post. Too bad for you. Not a lot has gone on recently, but last night was the funniest night at the blue.  There was this guy that's a little.... off that comes into the party store every now and then. Before he broke shit that I had to clean up, another time he couldn't figure out a 2 for 1 deal. This time, he bought like, 2 40's (that's a lot of fuckin beer) and he got to the store on his bike. So, I see his bike outside like, an hour later and figure he left it or something. Then, another hour and another hour (its 9 now, when I leave). I walk over to the porta shitter, and I knock, no answer. I pull on the door, and its locked. So, this fucker has been passed out in the shitter for 3 hours. I couldn't stand 3 seconds in that thing. So, we call Steve and ask him what to do, he suggests kicking the thing over, as did I, but nobody was there to prevent him from having a drunken rage. So, he comes in, pulls up on the lawn right in front of the thing and blares his horn 20 times. That must have woke him up. He tells him to 'get the fuck out of the shitter', he's 'been there for 3 hours', and 'it must have been one hell of a shit'. After like, 5 minutes, he gets out and stumbles around, and walks his bike home or something.   If anyone ever needs an example for why not to drink, there's a damn good one. You can see a lot of this type of thing at the party store, and if it wasn't for that job I probably would drink more often. That's probably the best aspect of that job.

      Such a great word... Anyways, today was the 2nd and final day of the yearbook deal, and it was pretty much the same as the other day, as in I didn't learn very much. But, go figure. Talked to some people at lunch today, found out they sucked as the use of these words/phrases 'fagget' 'that's tight' 'dashboard confessional and good charlotte rock' and last but not least, 'omg' pronounced OH EM GEE. Gag me with a fucking spoon and kill them with the knife that is part of the same utensil kit wrapped up in a napkin. Satt didn't show up today either, so we were completely on our own the whole time, and we kept asking questions that all the other yearbook students just kinda gave me weird looks, like when I asked what a 'flat' was, and a 'ladder' and a few other things. I had no idea, and they thought we were fucking 3 year olds.  I wanted to go to Pinball Pete's tonight, but didn't. I need my god damned arcade fix. Maybe I can go when I don't have to work next. That's like, Sunday night. Maybe. Corey was also back in time for his shift today, and I dunno what when on there, I just saw the probe there and didn't worry further. Hopefully he's not fired, and just got yelled at or something of the sort.   Wow, I realized that after all this time of writing shit and having teachers say its great, even though it takes 5 minutes to do and the only reason it gets done is because I want to pass the class, it actually is pretty good. I wrote some... Thing about today right in this spot, but took it down, because I know about 4 or 5 people (though, I doubt any of them read this anyways) may misinterpret. So yeah, I don't like writing.

      I wrote a big long ass update, but my computer froze right near the end of what I was typing, and I dont feel like typing it all again, so I will summarise.  HELL FUCKING YEAH! I got cable modem today. It rules, to bad that I dont have the money for games/graphics card (I will soon, very very soon) or I would be gaming now. Its fast and that makes a happy Ryan  I had half of my yearbook thing in Ypsi today. It was lame, I already knew mostly everything they told me, so no gain in knowladge. I also wasnt aware that yearbook was such a chick thing, because there was about a total of 12 guys, and like 110 girls. 30 or so were hot, so it worked out great for me. I didnt meet any of them because they all mostly seemed like the millions of preppie bitches that roam the highschools halls, so I didnt bother. I hate truckers hats. I wanted to stab about 15 people today because they were wearing them. I HATE THEM WITH A FUCKING PASSION! The dexter yearbook is also one of the better ones around, all the otherones suck quite a lot. They have companies take pictures for them, and even design shit. Where is the fun in that?  Anyways...  I will be working a lot lately, because I think Corey will be fired soon. I have to go down there tonight because nobody was at work today, and I will do the bare needs, i.e. backstop, sweep mop, and fill the lowest coolers. Also, Corey is supposed to work tomarrow, but wont be back from Alabama until LATE tomarrow, and I guess I'm going to have to go in and do some shit, even though I REALLY dont want to. Oh fucking well. If Corey gets fired, and I dont get a raise, I'm quitting. No fucking joke, because I dont want to be held responceable for all his shifts, there is no way in hell I can do that. I have shit of my own to do, not work 24/7.  Ok, I didnt make that brief, in fact, thats more then I origanally posted. Whatever =P Oh yeah, I'm half posting these so you can see 'teh funnay' and half posting them so I can download them myself. Enjoy big movies.  urlLink Pretty For The Party  and  urlLink 21 Grams

      Story of the night - At work today, some guy left his truck at the party store while he went canoeing. Now, people do this all the time, we get pissed, but it dosnt really matter. But today, this moron left his car out there that has a GAS LEAK. Party Store. Where people buy alcohol. AND CIGARETTES. Fucking moron could have blown up the place. We decided to throw some dirt over this so it didnt happen. Once the guy finally comes back, he backs up, over the curb and down TO the river. What a fucking lush. Once they are gone completely, I see that they threw a cigarette butt right on the pile of dirt. If that shit wasnt there, it would have been one intresting night.  Other than that, I went to Peach Mt. for the public telescope... thing. It was cool, they had the massive (and DAMN expensive) telescope out, as well as people with their portable shit. There was a lot of cool shit to be seen, I need to go again to the next one. Thing is, they are once a month, and its not as clear as tonight was hardly ever that day falls on, but we got lucky this time.

      Well, Phil had his little party deal tonight. First we watched 'The Ladies Man' and had some really shitty pizza (he didnt get any cheese, they got nasty toppings). People left, then a few of us went to D-ops. I didnt get to play the sweet setup, but I played Unreal, and for only playing once before, I fucking rock at it. I cant wait for my cable modem then my graphics card. It will totally rock my face. Yeah, other then that, nothing.

      I started working at the blue. The first few months I didnt mind, but then I gradually got sick of it. I'm not sure if I'm going to get the traditional one year raise because Bob is a jackass. I wish I could tell you how many hours I wasted there, but I dont feel like figuring it out.  Well, I could have gone to D-Ops again today if I didnt have to work, but I did so I didnt. Oh well. Phil is also having a party tomarrow because he is going to Interlochen (someplace in Germany or something..) for 8 weeks, basically the rest of the summer. A lot of people do shit over the summer, and it makes me angry. I realized that I have never been away from this shithole town for more then 10 days at a time. I think a months vaction would do me good. Hell, a 2 week vacation would be fine as well, I'm just so sick of the same old shit week after week after week. Oh well, I guess thats life for ya.

      I dont feel like giving a full review of the other cd's, but I'll say this. They both fucking rock. Get them.... now.  I went to  urlLink Digital Ops  today and they had this beast set up  urlLink here  with the 6800. All I can say is I cant WAIT for that fucking card to come out. GOD. UT04 rocks as well.  I also got the original DDR and Rival Schools for ps1 today at the videoplace for cheap, so I'm happy about that. All in all, a damn good day.

      Well, I got the cd's I wanted finally. So far all I have listened to is the Beastie Boys one and heres what I have to say.  Its definatly not a traditional BB cd. Its not the Boys that use a lot of guitar work and the general 'party' atitude. And, I understand this. They arent the young guys they used to be. But, I do still like it. That said, there are a few politically oriented songs that just come off... corny. This is another thing of the whole they are older deal, and want to express thier opponions more then before.   I wish it was more BB traditional, but I think those Boys are gone, and never coming back. It wouldnt surprize me if this is their last album, even though it will sell well, and its a pretty damn good record. So, take what you will from that.

      Wow, a lot of people actually look at this. I'm surprized. Although, those are page hits, not unique visitors, so I'm going to add that in right below it, because I fucking want to =P  I went to the DQ to get a rootbeer float. Simple, right? The bitch gives me this sad excuse for one, it has like, 1 oz of rootbeer in it. So, that got be pissed off. I even tipped her 75 cents. Tip whore.  Anyways, today was generally uneventfull. I played a ton of SC today, and killed Casey every time in it, too. Me and my damn mutalisks, huh?  I also STILL didn't get the cd's, but Drew supposedly gets his car back tomarrow, so I'll get him to drive me there. I'll probably also end up getting a GBA game or two, even though I already have a shitload and I should be saving my money. Fuck that.  I encourage you all to leave comments, but if you do, put your name on there, I cant tell who a couple of the comments are from.

      Alright, I changed a couple things around here. The font style, and I added a counter, just for my own personal use so see if anyone really cares. Also, anyone can add comments now. Some people complained that they didnt want to sign up to do so, and that has been fixed. Comment away on my life!  Now, I still dont have that damned Velvet Revolver cd, and the Beastie Boys new one came out today, so its a top priority to get to best buy or somewhere and get those CD's. Also, I heard that Franz Fern..... yeah, that guy's song the other day, and liked it. I might have to pick that one up as well.  So yeah, no work today, or tomarrow, hopefully I can hang out with some people or something. Remember, I'm not just throwing this link into my away messages for no reason. Hint, Hint. Not much to say now, probably will later.

      I got the best responce at work today for getting a case for someone Hispanic Guy Wearing Backwords Hat With Tags Still On Them "Good lookin' out, bro" and shoots me the piece sign. So little kept me from dying of laughter on the spot.  It was hot today, and I was really blah all day until I had an energy drink (...Lost is the name of the BEST ONE EVAR) and yeah, then I was slightly less blah. I thought we would be seeing a nice and sexy new ATHF tonight, but nope. Oh well.  I'm going to be experimenting with the layout and all that sorta shit on this site, so expect changes in a week or so, if you're lucky.

      Well, I ended up going over to Philly D's house last night and a few people were over there. We ended up making a movie because Casey is fucking obsessed with doing it, but it was still cool. I was a monster and I killed a bunch of people. It was fun. We also used some super top of the line special effects called 'Ketchup' and it worked out really nicely. The splatting sounds it made were definatly funny. People are supposedly going over to Andy's to edit to prettyness so I shall see the final project soon.

Yeah, I dont really have much to write about right now, other then by the looks of it, I'm doing jack-shit tonight. Oh well, its turning out to be just like last summer...

      I just realized another thing that pisses me off about people. This one is, that I HATE when people hate Bush for no reason at all. I mean the kind of people that think they are punk, listen to all the lyrics and shit, and hate Bush because its the 'OMG!11one PUNX0R' thing to do. A nice example of this is Emma. And, let me tell you this now, I will be blunt on this blog and give examples of people without caring if the person reads it or gets pissed off at it. I'd rather be hated for what I am, then loved for what I'm not.

      I am so fucking sick of this whole 'Reagan iz dead OMG!11' shit. He was a president, big deal. He didn’t do anything fucking incredible, but also didn’t suck the hell out of the office. Mundane. They declared today a federal holiday. Why? Because someone with power died? What about the thousands and thousands of people every day that die? They get nothing more then a report in the 10 o'clock news,  if  that?  Is this going to happen when Clinton dies? Bush Sr./Jr.die? Devoting a whole day to them and remembering all the good they did and nothing of the bad? That defeats the whole purpose of remembrance, focusing on the good and not the bad. You need to remember things as they were, not all prettied up so to honor the person. I guess that’s why some people have a problem with me, I like it as it is. No falsities, just straight truth.   And that can be applied to me in so many ways. I hate people who are fake, and I like being told the truth. Like my boss, I guess is a good example. I hear he bitches about me left and fucking right, but not TO me. How the fuck is it going to do ANYONE any good unless it is directed where it should be? Nobody else cares about your problems, tell it to the person you have a problem with so that it might not happen as often.  Speaking of my job, I'm glad that it is currently impossible for me to be fired, because if I could, tonight I would have been. Got yelled at by all but 2 of the employees. The reason I cant be fired is because the only people doing what I do is me, obviously, and Corey. It would take at least a week to get someone ready to work alone by themselves, if not more. So, as it is now, I would be given something like this 'You are fired next week, but you have to train this fucker right here how to do the job' but that just wouldn’t happen.  I have been working there almost a year (on the 17th is one full year). I hate that job, but maybe this raise will make it worth it? If I fucking get a raise, because of my cheap ass motherfucking boss. Whatever, I'm done here.

      Well, I will be posting a lot about how much my family sucks and the level at which I hate them, and this is the first one. I look over at the calender, which is my parents idea of telling us what they are doing, and see 'Dad Wedding/Mom Wedding /Mom b-day' I knew about all of this, just not the date that it occurs on. I asked where dad was about, 3 minutes ago and 'Oh, he flew down to the wedding yesterday'. I had NO fucking clue where he was or what he was doing. Thanks a lot, ass. And as for my mom, aprently I'm the 'thoughtful one' but that dosnt make one bit of sence to anyone but my fucking crazy mom. God, I'm so sick of this.

      Yeah, I ended up getting the Zim DVD, but I didnt get the damn CD because 'I wasn't 17'. Asshole Gore and his wife for making that damn parental advisory manditory to begin with. But, whatever.  So, at work today, I was the clumsyest (wow, new word) person ever. Broke like, 6 bottles, knocked a stack of Mt. Dew over, and at the end of the night, spilled a whole fucking mop bucket of water onto the floor. Ahhh, I hate that job. I have to work tomarrow, Saturday, Sunday, and Monfuckingday. Oh well, whatever I 'Gotz to get paid'.  I'm also really fucking sick of those stupid pr0n IMs I get all the time. Really fucking annoying. Also, you can plan on seeing many updates all the time, because as I'm sure you already noticed, I do it a lot. Probably end up doing it every time I get online. I dont have much of a life, oh well.   Yeah.

      Yeah, so I'm going to borders right now in hopes that they have the Invader Zim DVD, and if they dont, I'm making Drew drive me every-fucking where. I called up like, 6 places, and for some reason they all thought I was saying 'Invaders in' despite the fact that I repeted myself 15 times slowing, and even to one guy, saying "I-N-V-A-D-E-R SPACE Z-I-M"   'All im getting is 'Invaders from Mars' indicating that he typed in 'Invaders'. I hate people. And I'm getting the Velvet Revolver cd. And whatever else I feel like.

      Well, I have succomed to the hundreds of thousands of people who decided to make a we'blog'. Granted, my life isnt very intrested, I know there are times when I wish I could talk about something random as balls, and that sort of thing. So, instead of explain myself like a huge moron, I'm just going to post, and you will get my personality pretty quickly.  Ok, now for the real 'Hey I'm going to pretend someone is intrested in my life'post. Yesterday (Tuesday) was probablly the coolest day of my life. I got into a car crash (kinda) and had taco bell after school got out for the year (w00t and a fucking half my friends), went to a park to throw some frisbee, owned in Halo (I hate that fucking game soooo much, not to mention the fucking zebra sized controllers)  got into 2 separate water fights, watched the coolest movie ever, The Crippled Masters, and fell asleep in Ian's bed. Nobody was in said bed with me at the time, so get that right the fuck out of your head. Wow, I love run-on sentances.  Today was kinda like, chill out day. Got home, and just did nothing. Played some Starcraft, and went upstairs to my air conditioned hole. Its been fucking hot lately. Well, I have work tomarrow, and I'm sure I will be bitching about that tomarrow at this time. Till then, later.

      Yeah, not much has been going on lately. Home on a saturday night pretty much says it all. Oh well.    Well, I see that there is a bunch of new shit on my bloggin site, so something may look different soon. If its intentional or not is yet to be seen.     Had to work today, and thats about all that went down. Oh, I also went down to that St. Joes suck-fest, and looked for any videogaming goodies, all I found were some old ass PC games that dont work on my XP system, and a sealed Dreamcast Space Channel 5, and I dont even have a DC. It was only a buck though. I will probably end up getting one someday because there are a lot of good games and the systems are cheap. Poor Sega, I wished people supported them more. Oh well, most people are lemmings and blah blah blahdy blah.    I get to work again tomarrow, lucky me! I get paid monday, and I bet I wont do anything that day either. Well, half of my summer was good, thats an upgrade from last year. I suppose.

      I decided that if I could only do one thing for the rest of my entire life, it wouldn't be listen to music, it wouldn't even be playing videogames. It would be watching a thunderstorm. The rain and thunder are just so soothing to me, I dont know why. I love the loud overhead snaps. Is it bad that I am calmed by something so destructive? Nah, cant be...  Anywho, Not much has been going on in Ryan-land for me. So, I'll post some more cool shit, rather then what else I was thinking of posting (I'm sure I will soon enough though)  K, first thing.  urlLink Newgrounds . They have a bunch of crazy-rad flash animations and shit. For those of you who dont know, that is basicaly web animations. The site used to be riddled with pr0n ads, but they got rid of them, so feel free to browse. The naughty ones are even marked, so you can avoid (or flock) to them.   Thats it for this one. I'm going to play something before I go to bed. Again.

      I just realized that I am actually having a good time doing this. Even though you fucks dont comment, its still fun.  Anyways, today I found out that many, many people dont know what the 'Devil Horns' sign stands for. Pointer and pinky in the air, you know. If you are reading this, you should know what it means, rock on, or rock an roll. That sort of thing. A lot of dexter morons dont know what it means. I was at work, my brother drove by, did it, and my coworker was right there. She didnt know what it ment, and I decided not to tell her, being the cool guy that I am. So, she started asking customers, and got the strangest responces. Parents thought it was 'really bad' but when asked what it meant, they didnt know. They obviously were told (or, because they didnt know, maybe they werent) that it ment something along the lines of 'i warship the devil'. Some people mistook it for the peace sign, and the 'hang loose' sign. Crazy fuckers. Although, the funniest responce was this, 'It means peace in Iraq. It started when the war started to promote peace and to show them over there that we mean good.' I mean come the fuck on! If you dont know, then say so, dont make up some stupid bullshit lie. Again, my hope for this world dwindles every day.

      So, I went and saw anchorman, and it was some funny shit. It was just so incredibly stupid, that it was hilarious. Great acting and funny jokes. Will always goes to the next level with all his acting, and it makes it so much better. I mean, look at the cowbell skit!

      I went and hung out with Zach and Ashley today. It was a nice change from hanging out with 'the regulars'. But, we still managed to end up at Pete's. I love me 'dem videogames. Of corse, I showed them how much I rock at DDR, among other games. We came back here so I could pick up some DVD's, and we ended up picking Family Guy (only the first one, I still need the 2nd one) and watched it at Ashley's house. I also had to 'fix' her computer, but I didn't get enough time with it, plus its a really ancient machine, so whatever. Inuendo is fun!  I was going to post about a more pressing issue, but once it comes up again I will, today just dosn't seem to fit in with it.  Oh, I also got the UT2K4 demo, so I have just been ruling with that beast. I'm very surprized that it even runs with this shitty videocard. I almost have the money for the best card out there, but I dont know if I want to spend it all on that, because this computer has some problems, and I dont want to end up with another melted card. Maybe I need to get a new power supply for this thing. Whatever, I can worry about money later.  Night-

      All I ever talk about is stupid shit that is going on in my life. So, for this post, I'm going to share some cool shit with the all of you.  First off, I'll go with the rad ass online comic,  urlLink Ctrl+Alt+Del . Now, any nerd knows what that means, so thats a good hint as what its about. The guy posts a bunch of kickass comics, some relating with videogames, and they are all funny as shit.  urlLink This one  is the one that I found and started going to regularly for.  Now for a good band. Tsunami Bomb. I found them at the Warped Tour last year, and have been a fan from that day. Even got the CD signed that day! Many of you have seen me with the shirt on no doubt, so there you go. You can go  urlLink here  and listen to some of the songs. Number 1 is from the newest album that isnt out yet, and 2 is the newest released, and the last is from the EP they have. Enjoy!  Thats good for now, but I'll make it a point to post more about cool shit then just whats been going on recently.

      ...you have to whittle your own clothing. Think about it. Nobody wears wooden shirts, so its the only way to do it, sorry all you Hot Topic lovers!  Anyways, yeah. Two nights ago I spent the night at Phil's, and that day we just did stupid shit. I had to work a little before, and after that we eventually went to d ops. I owned at UT2K4, like always. I also stole a GBA game from Meijers, because I was bored. It was a Crash Bandicoot game, and it was worth it, its a fun little platformer. We played video games until 4 in the morning. It was cool. I also woke up without anything written on  my face, and I was surprised. (Last time, I woke up with a Hitler 'stache. Bastard.)  So, I have been working randomly, like always. I got the biggest pay ever on Monday, being $140. Wewt. And today, Bob gave me a 20 for working my ass off on Friday and Saturday, because it was busier then hell. So, it was really $160. Yummy.  Last night, I watched Big Fish. Best movie I have seen in months. When I asked people what it was about, and nobody could really give me an answer, and I understand why. Just go see it/rent it/ buy it, what the fuck ever, DO IT NOW!  I'm listening to Mitch Hedburg right now, he's a comedian. Funny. Go buy one of his CD's. Again, now.

      Yeah, today I had to work 11-4, and it was rather busy. But, the coolest thing happened, there was like a fucking Vespa club. There was a good 30-40 of them, all rad as hell. They took up most of the parking lot, and all came into the party store. Busy busy. It was definatly cool to see them all.  I also went to the Hudson Mills fireworks deal, like I always do. Met up with some people and hung out. Before I met up, I talked to a bunch of people from my grade that I hadn't really planned on seeing all summer, but it wasn't a problem at all. I actually found out that this blog does get around, and that high hit-count may actually be accurate. Go figure, huh? I may have decided to keep this up and running for a while longer. Atleast till the end of the summer. Who knows, maybe this time next year I'll still be doing it. Whatever, thats way to far ahead for me to be planning anything, even as stupid as it is. Yeah, later

      Yeah, not much updating is going on. My brother with his game, and the two consectutive days that my computer freezes right in the middle of writing being the main causes, oh well.  A few days ago (read: three) I went to some girls lake (Laura or Lauren?) and hung out. She was a friend of a friend, and we had shit to do, so it makes sense. Yeah, we were there for awhile, before we went all around Ann Arbor, I got another ATHF shirt at Middle Earth, and all was well. I have to work a lot lately, yesterday, today, tomarrow and the day after tomarrow. But, the last two are during the day, so its not to bad.  Not intresting, is it? Also, I really am beginning to think that counter is way off, so if you actually READ this thing, make a comment. One comment, all it has to say is 'i read it' 'i hate you ryan' 'cheese is fun' whatever, just something so I know how many really read this. I dont know if I should still bother if its just like, one person reading.

      Today was Dexter Daze... day. For the possible one of you that dont live here that is reading this, its some crappy little event held downtown to sell shit. I usally go just to hang out with people, and this year was no aception. I hung out with Dirty Tom mostly all day. He had a little tent set up on some guys property that he knows right down there, so we were just hanging out and having people come join us. Not a whole lot of people were down there, but I wasn't that surprized, because it was a bit chilly, and because Dexter Daze is pretty stupid in general. Neil got this rad-ass wooden/picture/cutout thing of Jimi Hendrix, and its sweet as hell. This guy cuts pictures into pieces of wood and frames them, and they turn out sweet as hell. Me, being the loser that I am, thought it would be cool to have an ATHF one, because the guy had a bunch of other cartoon ones. But, it wont happen. The other best part, was this band playing. Not one at the gazeebo, but near the cookie place. It was three black dudes, and they were playing mainly blues songs. The lead singer had an incredible voice, and rocked at guitar. The bassist had a sweet looking bass as well. We talked to them, they said that they were actually a hard rock band, but for paying gigs they just played that stuff. Made sence to me. The shitty thing is, that there was pretty much 3 people watching them the whole time, me and Tom being 2. They had such a shitty location, they deserve to be on the gazeebo. Thats the thing, music is all about promotion these days, and not quality. They were a lot better than any band they had up there, hands down. Oh well...  That also goes on tomarrow, and I will probably only be down there for like, 2 hours tops because I have to go to work at 4. I work until 10, and at 10:30-ish I'm leaving to go spend the night at some chick who I dont know's house. She is taking me and Brian to the Warped tour, and its easier if we just sleep over there. The lineup this year blows shit, but it gets me out of working, and its better than just sitting around doing nothing like this whole summer has pretty much been. So, I'll  probably post again after I get back from warped, so like, 1 am monday. Yay.

      ..That being hard/metal Japanese music. I know, you probably didn't know such a thing existed, but it does. And it fucking rocks. I have obviously been playing DDR, and I always thought that the J-Pop was decent, and there are even a few songs that I like to listen to. But, this shit is different. The two bands that I currently love are 'The Pillows' and the 'Sex Machineguns'. The Pillows provide the soundtrack for the anime FLCL (Fooly Cooly, Furin Kurin if you want to be an ass about it. This is one of the only 2 animes that I have ever liked, so dont get all over my case) and it rules. They are mostly rockin out, but there are some slower songs. It does have to acompany some dramatic moments in the anime, so thats understandable. I found out about Sex Machineguns from playing Guitar Freaks. They also fucking rock. The only problem is that I cant find a CD of theirs that isnt a single that is less than $30 each. Not exactly something I want to do. Nothing of theirs is on Bittorrent either. And I stopped doing P2P. If any of you feel like being a pal, do a good ol' search on them, and send/burn me the results.

      I went and saw 'Collateral' tonight. It's the movie staring Jamie Foxx, and Tom Cruise. Basically, Foxx plays a Taxi driver, and Cruise plays a hitman. The hitman makes Foxx drive him around 'on hire' to do all his dirty work until he needs to leave in the morning. I suck at explaining, but anyways, it was a pretty decent movie. Nothing extrodinary, but still good. I'd say 7/10. It also proved that Jamie Foxx can actually act, something that I was unaware of. Other then that, I didn't do shit. Played some Doom 3, you know. Tomarrow I have to work. Oh well. I also decided that once skool starts up again (3 weeks or so... ::cringe:: I hate that place and 90% of the people in it) that I'm going to save the majority of my money each week (I. E., around $100 a week). It will probably go for a car, but I need to take drivers ed and all that good shit, so I figure that I can get a pretty good 2 or 3 grand car by the time I can drive it. Insurance is another thing...

      I played DDR today, then went to work. Got home and a few hours later went out to Pete's. Played DDR, and they had the new version of Guitar Freaks. They replaced 4th mix, and that was my favorite. So, it kinda sucks. They are also going to get in DM 10th, so that will be a cool thing to play. They do need to fix the shit they have though, some of the sensors are a bit screwy on DDR, and the Drummania games drums are a bit fucked. Oh well, Hopefully they are smart enough to get that shit done.

      Just been working and screwing around. Playing Doom, all that good shit.  Me and Dirty Tom when war-driving last night. Thats when you take a laptop with a wireless card in it, and drive around looking for Wireless Access Points. We didnt do anything to the shit we found, but we DID find a lot of them. A lot in the sub-division by Mill Creek, and the one behind Country Market. Not as many as I thought there would be in Loch Alpine, though.

      Yeah, I'm going at this again. But if the same shit goes down, I'll be bye-bye for good.  So, I'll just post the intresting shit from the past while.  On the second, I went to the most kickass show. The story of how I got there goes a little bit like this. First off, last year when Tsunami Bomb was in town, Clarissa's brother agreed to take us about 2 months before the show. The day before he decided that he didn't like me, so backed out. So, this time I tryed to make sure the same shit didn't go down, so I went with a reliable driver, Drew. Guess what he did? Backed out the day before. So there I was, asking everyone and their dad (seriously) to see if I could get a ride there. After I had basically given up, I mentioned something about what happened to Ashley. So she got her dad to drive us, and she owns me for awhile. (I decided it was only until Tuesday). The show ruled. The opening acts were pretty good, and I had a little moshing action going on there. Once TB took to the stage, I stopped with all that and listened. Such a great performance, I cannot even say. I did get to finally meet someone that I have been talking to for almost a year online at the concert, her name is Celeste ( urlLink www.cherrybomblovesyou.com click it, its painless)  Anyways, she was cool, and it was great to finally meet her. We will hopefully be attending some more concerts together soon.  Part 2 of three. I got my sweet ass new RedOctane dance pad for DDR. Call me a loser all you will, but this pad rocks my face off. Its really great, and I think that I can finally get to do some heavy songs with the good old DDR-ness. I got a bunch of stepmania songs for me to fuck around with once I get it all figured out on my computer upstairs. It will also rock.  Last part, that happened today. Doom 3 Holy. Fucking. Shit. This game is beyond 'This game rocks, end of story' because it does. That makes sence. Graphics look great on my comp. Game is fun as hell. Scares the shit out of me (I had to pause to take a dump, and I wouldn't lie about something like that.  Yeah, I'm back. SUCK IT DRY (Japanese accent)
