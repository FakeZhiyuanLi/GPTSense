      My days really suck.  I can't seem to have a good one to save my life.  I really give up...I don't know what to do anymore, I always manage to ruin whatever kind of good day I already have.  I need to learn to keep my mouth shut and not say anything to anybody because I'll just end up ruining it.

      This morning was youth sunday at church.  I was running the sound board like always, and it was harder than on days with a regular service.  Nobody knew how to hold microphones or anything.  Definately interesting and different.  I guess its because none of the people involved ever see what goes on for set up or how to actually run any of the equipment.  It was hard for just about everybody...but O well.  It went better than expected compared to the rehearsals.  And this afternoon theres a church pic-nic to go to, assuming it doesn't rain.  Any ideas of what my Girlfriend and I can do tomorrow???

      Finally done with most of the work for today.  I finished with the dock from last weekend, and I got paid so now I finally have some money.  I still don't know what i'm going to do on Monday since I have off.  Chau wants to goto Busch Gardens and i'd kinda like to go...but I want to do something just my girlfriend and I since its my only day with her all weekend.  I guess I'll just leave it up to her (I hope she's reading this ;-) ) Anyways, I just want some time with just her.  But all I have left to do is to goto the dump, and I'm all ready to go; just waiting on my brother to finish up his part of the grass.

      That movie was great.  Kinda predictable but great none the less.  My girlfriend thought it would be too much of a guy movie and its too bad she's in Maryland for the weekend because it has an underlying love story to it.  Its not nearly as much of a guy movie as she would have thought.  The movie was really predictable, every little thing foreshadowed something else and it was always the obvious.  Maybe its because all natuaral disaster movies are close enough to the same, I dunno.  I just thought that the movie was really nicely done.  Special effects were nicely done as well, and I certainly hope so for as much as it cost (I don't know exactly other than in the hundreds of millions).

      Don't you just hate days where everything seems fine(at least compared to other days anyway); and then it all takes a huge turn for the worse near the end.  I really don't know what to do.  But whatever, School is almost over for this year, one more week before exams....

      Lately I just don't feel happy.  Usually i'm happy and content with everything...but lately every little thing has annoyed me, I don't know why, so whatever.  I still don't really care; but I just feel like my girlfriend is always mad at me about something...I really don't know what to do.  If you have any ideas please leave a comment or look at my profile and send me an E-Mail or IM me or something.  Please Help

      My days are getting really bad, sunburned, annoyed really easily.  I'm tired of everybody trying to keep everybody else happy.  Why can't everybody just be straight forward with everybody else and make it so much simpler for everyone.  Everyone in this world is too easily offended and too worried about offending everyone else; they all need to simply get over their problems caused by differences and be truly happy instead of faking it all the time to make themselves look good.  Nobody is perfect and always happy so just be human and stop worrying about keeping everybody happy and just be yourself!

      Now for the long Story....  Our SOL tests had to be cancelled for 3 days b/c our computer support policy is not to update windows until there is a problem.  Sasser got in...and now there is roughly 1000 computers infected and our tech team has to walk around to every single one of them over 10 schools and patch and clean every single one in every single room that has xp or 2k...just goes to show that patch ahead of time and allow end users to patch...otherwise it gives everybody a headache later.

      Today in AP chemistry we started a Forensics Unit...since AP Tests are over.  We're going to end up having to solve a murder using DNA testing, Hair testing, blood typing etc. etc.  Hopefully we'll end up  getting the right murderer...and then our local police will come in and take care of the arrest and everything...we're going all out...even though the murder is completely fake and all the dna etc. is supplied by VT.  look for a story about it in the Daily Press.

      My AP English teacher recently decided to not give us our 100% on the exam from passing the SOL because she doesn't agree with our elected school board.  Who is she to decide what all of our small county wants.  That's why its the school board and not the AP English 11 teacher board (which would consist of only her)  When I asked her about it I found that she wasn't going to tell us and we would all find out after school was over (probably because we're the most active class politically [3 of us going to girls/boys state]) At lunch I rounded up some of my fellow class members and marched in the Assistant principle office that's in charge of English and told him what's going on.  Sadly I was elected speaker of the group.  After speaking with him he wrote down our comments and the facts and told us he would take care of it.  Later that day I found out that our principle will e-mail the AP Teachers reminding them that they have no choice in the matter and they *must* give everyone who passes our state profiency test must be given a 100 A on the exam, no just exemptions but an A (hey...Its 20% of our semester grade).  My English teacher would be furious, its a good thing I asked that we all remain anonymous.  And luckily, she doesn't have the address for this blog.  Finally I don't have to worry about my exam grade anymore.

      With exams coming up and my days being like a roller coaster lately I haven't had a chance to update this as often as I would like.  Anyways just thought I'd post an apology to my 1 or 2 readers...if that.  I'm gonna go to bed, and hopefully post more in the future.

      I really should be posting more.  Today I had my AP Stats final exams, and it was friday.  I'm not a senior but it sucks for them because it rained like crazy during their senior picnic, and their band really sucked.  I sure hope mine is better next year.  1 week until graduation so 1 week until I'm a senior.  I found out today that the budget was aproved so I have a job for the summer now with the schools.  Full time and should pay about $6.50 a year because I worked with them last year too.  Anyways My AA server is up and named "Running With Scissors" so we finally have a clan and server name.  Thanks Nathan.  I'm gonna go get all that stuff set up.  And join the server everybody!

      I haven't posted in a while.  I've been way way way too busy.  Yesterday I had the AP Chemistry/Bio Picnic.  The day before that the new AA patch came out and I had orientation at NHGS for next year.  Now i've got to go finish up getting ready for school...We actually get our yearbooks today instead of waiting because of dumb SOL retakes...More on that later.
