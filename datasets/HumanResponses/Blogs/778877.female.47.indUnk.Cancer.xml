      Look what I got from Kathy for my birthday!       As you can see, it fits perfectly with my new easy chair/ottoman set (which arrived last week after a 12-week wait!!).       This is a closeup of the fabric for the set:       I love my chair, ottoman and the lamp!       Thanks to the comfy chair and the reading lamp, I'm reading a lot more these days. Hm, I think you can see Mousehole and her white paws peeking from behind the chair...

           Cleo gazing intently across the backyard. As the backyard is always bustlin' with small animals such as possums, moles, chipmunks and squirrels, especially in the overgrowth, I can never get her attention as long as we're on the backyard deck.

           I woke up at 6:30 in time for my LSD (long slow distance)...to a truly gorgeous morning, so I just had to go sit out on the backyard deck and just space out for a few minutes. When it looked like Newby was sleeping for a little while longer, I got a cup of coffee and sunbathed for a few minutes. I enjoyed the feel of warm sun rays mixed in with licks of cold air on my shoulders. Then, reluctantly, I had to get up and go walk.   At least, it was a perfect walking weather.

       urlLink    When I let Cleo outside, she immediately captured a huge dragonfly that was hovering on our deck. I never ever noticed the insect, and I was so aghast that I made Cleo release it from her mouth. It was still alive but panting hard in the sun, so I brought it out of the sun into the dark overgrowth.

       urlLink    A finished cross stitch kit. I started it last fall after receiving an order from a scrapbooker wanting a cover for her Halloween album. I was to finish it on December 1st, but I was sidelined by injury and holiday plans and wasn't able to finish it until now. Of course, the scrapbooker is no longer interested in it. I'll probably put it up for sale at eBay in the end, but for now, I just want to hold on to it and enjoy it. It was such a fun project.

       urlLink    I collect vintage Alfred Mainzer Dressed Animals postcards. I prefer the Belgium #4850-4998 series, which were printed in the 1940's and 1950's.  I first discovered these postcards while surfing on eBay back in January of 2001 and immediately fell in love with them. By early last year, my collection of 148 postcards was complete...except for the postcard numbered #4897. For some reason, the Belgium postcard had never shown up on eBay, though the other series of the same postcard is not so rare. So two weeks ago, I paid a visit to the Mainzer postcards page on eBay and my heart stopped when I realized the auction was from the Belgium series. To make sure, I emailed the seller to see if the postcard was really printed in Belgium and she assured me it was. I then won it via the last-second sniping. It arrived in the mail over the weekend, and now my collection is officially complete.

       urlLink    I found the figurine of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus in our backyard while mowing the lawn soon after we moved into our house back in 1988.   It was dirty after being half buried, and the top of her halo and her feet had been broken off, but I couldn't make myself toss it into the trash bin.   I also had no idea how to dispose of it properly, so I just stuck it in the silverware drawer.   After 16 years, it's still there.

       urlLink    Cleo and I looooooooooove sitting in the new chaise lounge. For a princess, Cleo can be incredibly filthy. With that in mind, when I'm not using the lounge, I flip the cusion over to the "wrong" side (translation: dirty and soiled from her past uses) to protect my "right" side (clean, of course!) from her use. However, I left the lounge for a few seconds (just to grab a Diet Coke from the refrigerator) without flipping the cushion and when I returned, Cleo was already on it. Then I recalled that a few minutes earlier, she had been busy rubbing "stench" (ya know, from wild animals...) all over her fur on the grass. Can we say, "EEEEWWWWWWWW!" Now I gotta clean the cushion and dry it in the sun for a few hours. There goes my blissful afternoon of reading. Grr.

       urlLink    Well, Sparty was stuck under the bed AGAIN this morning.  I was so maaaddd! I'm aching all over from the strenous activity of dismantling the KING-SIZED bed yesterday. I didn't sleep well last night because of the pain, so I decided that if there was going to be the dismantling again, Newby would do it, as soon as he came home from wherever. Sparty would be fine where he was...it wasn't that life-threatening. So there.  I showered and dressed, unloaded the dishwasher, popped in a load of wash, and straightened out the family room. And fed Cleo, Tiger, and Mousehole, and prepared three dishes with meds for the older kitties. When the dishes were ready, I let the older kitties in.  Guess who came in first? Sparty! He managed to unstuck himself all by himself.   For food, not for me!

       urlLink    Sparty almost scared me to death this morning!  I realized he was missing at feed time this morning. Come to think of it, I didn't see him last night either when I went to bed!  I did not want to stress Newby out in case it was unnecessary (he had some important appointments today that he couldn't miss) so I waited until he left and then started looking for the darn cat. As a last resort, I started looking under all the beds though I knew he wouldn't fit under any of them because he is a big baby and weighs over 30 lbs.  I finally found him under one of the guest beds, totally stuck. I had to dismantle the bed so I could release him. Poor baby...he peed for a long time and then gulped his food. He's doing fine now.  I'm such a bad mommy! :-(

       urlLink    We opted to stay home and watch the funeral procession on TV rather than travel to DC and be "touched by history"...though we only live across the river from DC, we've learned from many years of experience that it's better to stay home if you want the "front-row view" of an occasion/event, so...  President Reagan was the one who had the greatest impact on where I am today...  I was RIF'ed (reduced in force) from my first Federal government job (1981), worked for the Peace Corps in the Philippines for two years (1982-1984), got a job offer to work at the Pentag0n (1985), but let go due to a "poor performance review" *long story* (1986), got another job under a "Schedu1e A" (disability) program (1987) and then lost it due to a conflict of interest *another long story* (1989).  Yet, I'm very, very grateful for this quirky direction that led to my present happiness.

       urlLink    This is Lia, an adorable Tonkinese belonging to a vacationing couple we are friends with. So far, she's doing all the stuff that I've trained my own kitties not to do so. Sliding paws under the bedsheets in a playful way is the worst...apparently, Lia likes to "bury" her toys under the sheets. And, oh my gosh, but she PROWLS at night. She'll be with us until August 16th...so far, I've had nothing but sleepless nights and endless fetch games every night. Because Varinia and Mousehole, who are dominant types do not appreciate intruders, Lia has to stay in our bedroom behind a closed door. I do so love her hazel eyes though...

Why cross stitch designers always put those ridiculous bows on cats, I don't know, but they don't wear them in real life! Though the kit doesn't ask for much backstitching, you can tell from this photo that it badly needs it. I'm now working on the blue valance, so will post another photo as soon as I finish it.

       urlLink    Today marks five whole years since we lost Tabitha's sister, Sable...  Tabitha is sitting behind a needlepoint pillow. It was given to Newby in 1982 after his cat, Samantha was put to sleep. Like Tabitha and Sable, Samantha was a Sealpoint Siamese.  Except for the six years between Samantha's death in 1982 and our adoption of Tabitha and Sable in 1988, Newby has never been without a Sealpoint Siamese or two his whole life.   His grandmother was the one who instilled in Newby a love of these cats. She was in the habit of adopting pairs. So Newby grew up with two pairs of Sealpoint Siameses.   The first pair was Lucifer and Tinkerbell. Tinkerbell was run over by a car at a very young age, and Lucifer lived to be about 25 years old. Though Lucifer has been gone since the 1960's, the family still talks about him.   The second was Samantha and Scarlet O'Hara. Scarlet O'Hara was put down at age 9 after she was bitten by some wildlife, and Samantha lived to 17 years old.

       urlLink    A while ago I read in a cross stitching forum about needlecraft mystery paperbacks. I rarely read mysteries anymore, but I was very, very intrigued by them. So when Newby said he was heading to the library, I asked him to check out one of these books so I could see whether I'll like it or not.   Well, he brought home the ENTIRE series!! :-/ I have to admit they look really interesting.   Oh well, you know my plans for this week! :-) *adjusting and patting the cushioning on my deck lounge*

       urlLink    Taken at breakfast this morning. Always the very first in the kitchen at breakfast, I couldn't interest her with her dish for a while. Our backyard has really been taken over by wildlife, providing fascinating entertainment for our furkids... All the greenery in our backyard is all swollen and lush from the many torrential rains we've had lately this summer.

       urlLink    It contains the full DMC 472-skein floss set. It was a steal at only $110, rather than the $.55 per skein = $259.60 that the local needlework shop normally sells. And the priority shipping was free. I ordered the set in a hissy fit after finding a great chart, only to find out I was out two colors.
