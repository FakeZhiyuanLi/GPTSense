      My moan today is inspired by my friend Deutsches, a link to whose blog is on this page.  Children's Television. After reading Deutsches's blog and hearing of this 'Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow' programme, I had to watch it, just to see if it was as bad as he had described. It was. Possibly one of the worst programmes I have ever seen. It features these two grown men fooling around in a badly constructed studio whilst getting all the child 'contestants' covered in muck and mess. I was only able to watch about 30 minutes of it - it was that awful. I can't see why any child would want to watch such rubbish.  Not only is that programme awful, there is another that caught my eye recently. Bernard's Watch. A few years ago, when I was young, I used to like this programme, and watched it almost every week. It featured a small boy, who has come into possession of a watch, which when a button is pressed on top, freezes time, letting him walk around in zero time. A farily original programme, with a narrator explaining the story, and the actors not saying too much. The story lines were often fairly good too. Then came the next series, introducing Bernard's little girl cousin, whom he shared the watch with. This was a drastic mistake in my opinion, sharing the watch was a bad idea, but it was still just about watchable. Then came the most recent series, the first episode of which I saw only a few weeks ago. Not only has this got a different child playing the part of Bernard - they really should have kept the original, or ended it completely, but they have done away with the Narrator. HOW COULD THEY DO THAT?!?!?! Also, they have added a crappy special effect, showing some sort of energy pulse emited from the watch as the button is pressed. Finally, they have changed the parents, who now are just total idiots. Why did they have to ruin the series? It USED TO BE GOOD I TELL YOU!!! This site shows the original cast (it was better in the first series, without his cousin) http://www.whom.co.uk/whom/bswatch.htm  These are not the only programmes that have gone downhill, a lot of programmes now on are no way near as good as the ones I used to watch.

      I seem to be feeling fairly good today (that's hormones for you), and can't seem to think of anything to rant about. Well, as I always say: 'When you can't blaim anyone, blaim America'. Ok, so it's the first time I've said that.... I shall now proceed to blaim America for all my troubles. 1) Global Warming. America/Bush refuses to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the greenhouse effect, possibly eventually destroying the planet. 2) Fossil Fuels. America continues to use fossil fuels as their largest source of energy. These will run out in a few hundred years, and then we will HAVE to use others. They also pollute. (ok, England also uses a lot of these, but I wont mention that :) ) 3) Energy wastage. 1% of American energy is used up because computers are left on overnight, normally doing nothing, and for no good reason. Apparently. This is also using up those presious fossil fuels. 4) Gun Crime. With the legalisation of guns in America, I wont be surprised if the UK soon does the same. American culture is also to blaim for our rise in gun crime. 5) America is one of the only countries not to sign an agreement to provide minimum standards for children 6) Evil corporations. McDonalds and CocaCola, possibly the 2 most evil corporations have invaded the UK and are poisoning our people. 7) Obesity. Due to McDonalds and fast food from America, about 1 in 3 adults will be obese by 2020, or something like that. 8) World hunger. I heard that the American military budget is enough to feed the entire third world. There is no way they can possibly need all that money on the military. 9) English. First they steal our language. Then they change our words. Then they use a really annoying high-pitch accent. 10) Stupidity. A significant proportion of American High-School children can not name a country in Asia.   With America looking so 'cool', many people from the UK wish to copy their lifestyle. I don't want this to happen, is the summary of my rant. To summarise the summary: England is turning American. To summarise the summary of the summary: America is a problem. That's all folks!

      Before I start today's rant (sorry I didn't post yesterday, I was... busy...) I shall post this little poem I found, which I think is rather good (well, compared to Heaney and Clarke anyway)  I think mice  Are rather nice.   Their tails are long,  Their faces small,  They haven't any  Chins at all.  Their ears are pink,  Their teeth are white,  They run about  The house at night.  They nibble things  They shouldn't touch  And no one seems  To like them much.   But I think mice  Are nice.   wasn't that a good poem?  Anyway, today's rant. As I was walking home from shool, I noticed that the local bus stop had graffiti over the timetable and the glass behind the bench. This graffiti looks awful, and it's even worse as I walk past the bus stop every day, and only a few weeks earlier that glass had been new, because someone had smashed it (youths no doubt). What is the point of graffiti? I really can't see any gain to the offender, as they are risking being caught. They have now totally ruined a bus stop, which will probably take several hundred pounds to replace, comming out of the tax-payers money! This money can then be no longer spent on school or helath supplies. Graffiti is a waste of money, and THERE IS NO GAIN FROM IT!! I really think that if someone is caught vandalising public property they should be made to pay AND fined several thousand pounds. I would also suggest 5 years in jail, if they weren't all full up already. These youths are making the town look horrible, and make it a less pleasant place to live, and most are getting away with it, and if they are caught, they only get a caution!!! I would like someone to tell me why people do this.

      Todays rant shall be at a much more personal level, probably to no inpotance to any people outside the duds (my group of friends, if anyone still does not know) Today's last lesson for me and megatrobe at school happened to be games. (wait, it gets worse!). Not only was it football, already described as a horrible sport, but it was on the exceptionally muddy school field, now less than half covered with grass. To top it off, IT WAS RAINING AND IT WAS F*****G FREEZING! Now, I'm not saying that games lessons are a bad idea, a lot of kids could do with the exercise, but do we have to do it outside when it is raining? Personally, I think it would be a much better idea if all games lessons took place inside during the winter and outside during the summer. It's torture to go outside when it's about 5 degrees and pissing down with rain. MOST OF US WERE IN SHORTS! And then you see the teacher standing at the edge of the football pitch with a huge coat on, really thivk trousers staring at us. I swear he's laughing at us... But I think it is very dangerous to to play sports on a wet field anyway, people could easily slip over, or failing that they could catch a cold from the freezing weather.  As I said, I don't think the games lesson itself is bad, exercise is good for you (supposedly), which brings me on to my next point, linked with Megatrobe's complaints about big companies. The number of overweight children in this country is drastically increasing, a result of modern fast food chains and easy pre-packed foods (crisps, burgers etc). These fast food restaurants are only interested in making a profit, no matter how much damage they have on the young people of society. Why can the government put taxes on fast food like they do on cigarettes and petrol, all are contributing to an over-worked health service. The ammount of fat and grease that is put into fast food is astronomical, far more than needed, topped off with far more salt that is needed. These unhealthy foods contribute to diseases such as diabetes, all of which could be avoided if fast-food restaurants and junk food were made more expensive. I for one have vowed never to eat McDonalds food again, it's disgusting, it's unhealty, and it's not needed. Apparently this generation of children are the first generation in however many years to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. My final summing up: Increase taxes on/ban junk food.

      Went back to school today after a week off for half term. Nothing particually interesting happened, but I have decided to focus today's moan on mobile phones.  Like sport, it may surprise many people that being a 15 year old male I do not own a mobile phone, mainly because I would never use one. Many people have suggested I get one, but really, what for? The only time I would even consider using one would be if I were out and wanted to phone home for something, but then I could use a pay-phone for a fraction of the price. Also, if I really, really need one, I could always use my dad's phone, which many people have pointed out is over 4 years old and ridiculously out-dated, but it seems to do the job. I can just about see how some people would need them, but then why do people insist on getting a new one every few years? If you have a phone and it works, then why replace it? It's just an unneccessary waste of money, and again probably linked to peer pressure which I have already mentioned. The most modern phones out now happen to have colour screens, games, internet access, video and picture messaging, and many other accessories, all un needed. And people then go and waste their money on it. I know it's not my money, and they can throw it away how they like, but surely it would be much better to give all this money to a charity to help dying people. I hate to see money being wasted when it could be going to good causes. Picture messaging? What is the point in having a camera on a phone, the pictures aren't even that good quality. We have cameras, we have phones, we have email, so what is the point in combining them? Video messaging is even more stupid. I would also like to complain about kids who seem to spend every minute of the day sending text messages to their friends, many of whom are standing close to them! Kids walk down streets holding expensive mobile phones, and then wonder why they are mugged, especially in cites. This as I have mentioned, is probably to feed drug and alcohol addictions, and very much linked with gun crime. Many people may think that in the future, with better technology we will be able to stop crime, but that would never happen. As better and better things are made to make gulliable people spend their money, more and more people will steal them, and as always, they will always find a way around police and law enforcement. There is no way things in the future will be better, things can only ever get worse on this planet, and the problem? YOUTHS.

      I'm back home to London, which means back to good ol' dial-up.  Todays moan shall follow up what my peers have said about the state of youth today. I'll probably be sounding like an old person when I say this, but I'm sure young people had much more respect for their elders many years ago. Why do these people just want to disobey adults, and laugh in the face of law and order? I tell you, it is these 'rudebois' who will be responsible for the breakdown of society and the introduction of guns for the police, which will then result in the increased levels of guns on the streets, meaning more guns for police, meaning the relaxing of gun laws untill it is leagal to carry a gun, which will be the point where we turn American and I commit suicide. I blaim partly America (as always) and partly this 'modern' music, which is more of just noise. People such as Eminem and 'Blazing Squad' (see Deutsches D's blog) have such a large influence on todays teens, and they 'sing' about sex, violence, drugs, and then get caught carrying knives and guns and complain they are being badly treated.   The second point I wanted to make was about drugs. Why do people even consider to take illeagal substances? What is the appeal of taking a substance that will potentialy kill you, or seriously harm your health? Supposedly the answer is 'peer pressure' which I don't fully understand, possibly because I'm not bothered what my friends think of me. If they were really your friends, they would not care that you don't wear expensive clothes (or in my case cheap clothes) Another point, drugs are also extremely expensive, which in order to finance, increases the levels of gun crime on our streets. As my english teacher would say: 'they are inextricably interwoven', in a welsh accent, or course.

      Now, what to have for today's little moan...? Ah, I know. Sport. Being a 15 year old male, some people find it rather surprising when I say I don't like any kind of sport. 'How can you not like football or rugby?' they say. This is why: Not only are sports very very dangerous, but they're dirty, rough, aggressive, tireing (sp?) etc. At school, the worst sport, in my opinion, we play is rugby. Somwhow I can't see what is fun about having 10 large men/boys charging at you ready to bash you to the grass, sorry, mud, only to get a small egg shaped ball that can't even bounce properly! Also, football... Last year, or the year before, we had some mornings off school because England were playing in a 'World Cup' competition. why were people so surprised to hear that I took the opertunity to have a slight lie-in and catch up on some homework? It's only a bunch of men kicking a ball around a field. And so what if our country does win? I don't think we did... Would us winning actually affect the lives of us in any way...? No. It was a great feeling however comming into school and being happy, whilst everyone else was sad because we lost.  More grumbles comming soon.

      I've added in another of my friends' blog, nonnesuch. I shall now do a post in the style of his grumpy ramblings:  I think I'll start with Cocacola, as I would think you all know, is a company/corporation (see nonnesuch's blog for the difference). I would just like to say how evil I think they are, firstly by their adverts on tv. In UK, their most recent advert shows a woman singing some sort of song, and handing out free bottles of their well known drink. I hate this because the song being sung sounds vaguely religious, like the ones you would hear in a modern church choir. Linking their product to religion, drawing their evil influence on possibly good-hearted people arghhhh!! Also, handing out free bottles, corrupting the minds of people, giving the impression that it is good value.... It almost had me convinced, but I soon realised what they were trying to do. Secondly the appearence of bins at school, with the CocaCola label on them, is terrible. How evil is that!?!? Advertising to young people in the school... it's not even a healthy drink, which leads me on to my next point: The drink is awful, costing possibly less than tenth of the price to make as they sell it at. All it is is water and flavourings with a bit of CO2 bubbled though it. It's terribly bad for your health too, dissolving teeth..., increasing the acidity of the stomach, dehydrating you. Why do people keep drinking this filth, it's horrible.  SAVE YOURSELF WHILE YOU STILL CAN!  Well, that's today's little moan out the way.

      Hey hey! Greetings from Bristol. The internet here is really fast, much better than the lousy dial-up at home. Had about a 3 hour car journey here, very dull. Stopped for lunch at a motorway service station. £10 for 2 salads and 1 coffee!!!!!! total swindle..... What fun it is here.

      I think the links here are sorted. I hope so. They are the blogs of 2 of my friends, who inspired me to write my own. Anyway, today's been dull, I did a little of that revision I mentioned earlier, playing on computer most of day. fun fun fun.

      So, I'm back here again, mainly because I'm totally bored. I had my haircut this morning, £9.00 is still a waste if you ask me.... So, what else... I've just seen the Spiderman MTV spoof, failry good, but no where near as good as the Matrix one. Also Steamboat Willie is quite good. I really should go and learn my German vocab. but over 300 words...hmmmm, nah. Oh yes, I should also revise for a business studies test on International trade in Europe.....*snore* bugger that.

      Yo ho all! The Dave O'C is back in 'da' house. Well when I say "house" it was only a hole in the ground covered by a piece of tarpolin, but it was a house to US. - A little Monty Python there. Aaaaaaanyway. I started writing this post about an hour ago, but got distracted with.... editing the Matrix script to fit....yes, well, you get the point. It's about 21:30, so I'm off for the night, toodles all.

      So, another post. Well, today's been fairly boring, I'm on half term which is nice :) Better than school anyway, where I'm in the company of all those 'cool' people. Today I went out and bought myself some speakers for my CD player, £20.00, not too bad. I don't know why I write on here, I already have a diary, on...err...what's it called again...? Oh yes. Paper. Very quaint. Authentic too. So..other things to say... I'm listening to my Monty Python CD, track 10 'I'm So Worried' - genius song. I'm just waffling now, so I'll shut up.

      So, here it is, my own blog. Shazaam! It's the first blog I've made, so I'll just be testing it for now. So, what about me...? No doubt if you're reading this you know me, so there is no need to explain who I am or anything (phew), but if you have stumbled along here without knowing me, I'll just say that I'm Dave, live in England and am incredibly bored, so that is why I'm writing a load of junk that I doubt anyone will want to read. My life could be described as incredibly boring, so that's why I write this sort of junk..anywho, I have a lot more boring stuff to go do, so that will be the end of my very first blog...........And forth I go.

      Evenin' All. As you have probably guessed, I've just been messing around the the HTML of this page. You are now privalleged to see: An Earthquake as you open the page A Random Lottery Number Generator Some good music Links to my friend's blogs, and other cool sites Cool pictures A Calculator, if your computer does not have one. A reaction tester thing  Some of this stuff was already here, but still, it adds to the list.  Anyway, haven't been up to much. I've stayed in all evening, didn't do any homework or revision. I saw another Star Wars Kid video - the Kill Bill version. He is just excellent. If you don't know what this is, go here:   urlLink  . (I'm not quite sure how to put hyperlinks on this. If this address doesn't show up, it's www.jedimaster.net.) This will prvide all the info you need. If you can't be bothered to go to this site, I shall explain. 'Ghyslain' is/was a teenager in Canada who was messing about with a metal pole, pretending it to be a double-ended star wars lightsaber. He was foolish enough to film himself doing this. When his friends found the video, they soon uploaded it for all to see. About a year later, over 100 versions of this have been made from the original 2 minute long vodeo. It's just amazingly funny. Watch the original one first. Well, I've said enough about him. Back to about me. Errr.... haven't really got much to say.  Oh well. Bye all.

      Bugger, I'm bored. It's Sunday afternoon and I haven't left the house all weekend AGAIN! But then, what is there to do in this town? Apparently there is, but hey, I'm not the sociable type. Err, I've kind of done my geography coursework, but not finalised it. I've done all the big parts of writing, but haven't put it all together. I really don't know what to write here, I have absolutely nothing to do. Well, I could revise for my GCSE exams, starting in about 2 months... bugger...that soon? Oh well. That would be boring. So, stuff I intend to do over the Summer. Definately build a Zepplin. That would be so cool. How hard could it be...? Maybe only a model one to start off with. A small motor attatched to a box hanging from loads of helium balloons... can't be that hard. Also learn Esperanto. That would be nice, it doesn't look that hard... Then I could talk to... err... someone elso who knows it.  Ok, I really can't be bothered to write anything else, so bye all.

      Time for another blog I think. Maybe a rant even. Oh yes. If you are a keen reader of my writings here, you may have read about a vandalised bus stop I came across on my journey home from school a while ago. It had the glass smashed in, and graffiti over the rest of it. A few days later the glass was fixed, and the bus stop cleaned up. Now, about a month later, not only is this glass smashed in again, but the glass on another bus stop across the road has also been broken. These acts of pointless vandalism make the town look dreadful and be an unpleasant place to live in. To fix these, it will cost the government money, which is in turn comming out of the tax-payers pocket. I HATE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS! Although, this does remind me of something my physics teacher told me yesterday. Most homes have electricity comming in at about 240V. Old factories have electricity comming in at a few thousand volts. If someone were to vandalise these factories, and the electricity supply hadn't been cut off completely, if they smashed the fuse box, or inlet of electricity, they would almost certainly be killed, as electricity at that high voltage can 'jump' through the air. Serves the damn kids right.  On another note, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS COMES OUT ON DVD 2ND APRIL!!!! WOOO!!!!! In Uk anyway...

      As you can see I've added a few pictures along the side of this, makes the site look a bit nicer I think. And if you hadn't noticed, the music and the counter I think are pretty swish, although they have been there for a while. I also added the about me, although come to think of it I don't know why, because only people I know have the URL to the site...meh.  A strange thing happened to me in English today.... I actually laughed. (Shock, horror!) And it wasn't just a small giggle, I was in hysterics for about 10 minutes, which DickyBod will back up. It started with my english teacher getting a bit angry - 'Look, boys, why do you do this to me yeh? We reeeealy haven't got time for this. Please just try and engage with this. Ok, focus, let's go.' He then get's a bit more wound up... 'Look, Harry, stop that, please? I beg you just stop doing that, we have to get this done'. It then goes a bit further...'*mutters under his breath* Argh, for f***s sake boys, why do you do this to me?' Anyway, whilst this is going on, me and dickybod are discussing the Simpsons, especially the 'Uncle Moe' episode. The funniest part? '*A buzzer sounds to indicate someone orders the million-dolar birthday fries, Moe gets twitchy, a small girl*:.... Unkie Moe....? What... is... it.... sweetheart...? My sodie is too cold and my teef hurt. Argh, your teeth hurt, well that's too freakin' bad, ya here?' Now, as my english teacher is getting more and more wound up, just the slightest hint of an '...Unkie Moe...?' from dickybod is enough to set me off laughing. I probably haven't laughed as much since seeing the MTV Matrix spoof for the first time. Now THAT was funny:  *Architect talks to Neo* 'You haven't answered my question' 'Yes I did, you see, what I...' 'You haven't answered my...' 'I'm trying! You just need to let me talk' 'Why am I here?' 'Urgh, would you just SHUT UP?' 'You wont let it...' 'NO YOU WONT LET IT! I'M THE ONE WHO TALKS! OK MOUTH SHUT, EARS OPEN' 'You haven't answered my....' 'YOU DO  NOT  WANT TO SEE ME GET OUT OF THIS CHAIR! Ergo open your yapper one more time and I'm gonna architect a world of pain, all over your candy ass. ERGO! VIS A VIS' 'This is about...' 'CONCORDANTLY'  Aaaaanyway. What else happened to me today? Nothing really. Oh well, ta ta for now.

      Another week has gone by (well, 6 days, I usually post here on a Sunday, but what with today being as boring as it has been, I decided to post a little early to relieve the bordom) and NOTHING interesting has happened. Really, it hasn't. I haven't left the house apart from to go to school for a whole week, which shows exactly how much of a social life I have. None. (Not that I want one of course. Oh no.) Exams are drawing ever closer, and I still haven't started revising properly. Looking at Dickybod's blog, I believe it may be time for another rant, but as my life is so boring, it is difficult to have too much anger at things. I suppose my computer would be a good start, as I am here for the majority of the day. Let's see... what do I hate about my computer.?  1. I still have Windows 98. Not too bad I suppose, but XP would be nice. 2. My processor is only 533 MGH. Again, not too bad, but I would still like a nice 2.6 GHZ. 3. I have only 96MB RAM, which is fairly bad, as my computer is always running slowly, and programs keep crashing. 4. The fan makes a noise, not really loud, but loud enough that you can here the computer on when you walk past the open door to the room I am in. 5. The sound recorder program is brocken. It wont record anything, and I know the microphone is ok as it works on the webcam program. 6. I only have a 56KB dial-up internet connection. Very slow to download things; rather annoying. 7. This has only started happening recently, but when I am not online and open a folder such as 'My Documents' or 'My Computer', the dial-up box opens and trys to connect for no reason. 8. When I turn the computer on, and the desktop loads, 2 error messages appear, although these may be a good thing, as they stop the computer loading unneccessary programs.  9. My mouse wheel often gets dirty, and sticks which is rather annoying. 10. To burn a CD, I can't just drag from a folder to the CD folder for some reason. Instead I have to open a CD burning program. This would just about be ok, but for another unknown reason, this will only open when it is newly installed. I have to uninstall and re-install it every time I want to burn a CD.  That's just about all the major bad points. If I think of any more, they will also be posted.

      I actually managed to leave the house this weekend, unlike last weekend when I stayed in from 15:40 when I got home from shool Friday untill 07:40 when I left for school on Monday Morning. Friday after school I went to Bromley with my sister for no reason really. For some reason I decided to buy myself a dictaphone for £40 from Argos. Probably didn't need it, but hell, I had the money to spend. I can now leave myself little reminders without having to use all that effort of having to pick up a pen. Saturday morning I went food shopping to Sainsburys which was very uneventful. Yesterday afternoon I watched 'Life of Brian' DVD, 'twas very good, although Holy Grail was better. I also watched 'Finding Nemo' which I didn't like very much. The ending was obvious and the jokes were not funny.  Geography homework was boring, but can't complain as we rarely get any. Writing about changes in tourism patterns around the world in the latter hald of the 20th Century. Chemistry was easy, just a few questions from the text book, and maths was dull; more intergration, this time, using it to find the area under graphs. This would have been ok, if I hadn't looked in the back of the text book to find my answers to the last two questions completely wrong. And I'm not changing my answers because each question had about a page of A5 working out. But still, can't complain, although I just have... so.... Anyway. Later today I will do my German homework, which will again be boring as hell, answering questions about my homelife, which I barely understand. I mean, what the swud does 'Was wirst du zum nachsten Mal in der Stadt kafen?' mean??? And there's 17 of them!! Ohhhh :( I had better do some business homework too, although that is not so bad, as it's an ongoing thing, and I'm already ahead. Well, I'm just sitting here putting off the inevitable... GERMAN HOMEWORK... so.... can I think of anything else to say...? No? Oh well, German it is then....  ta ta for now.

      Wow, haven't written here in a while; I seem to have run out of things to rant about... what a pity...  So, I've slowly noticed that the work-load at school is slowly increasing, still not too bad though. With my first GCSE exam just over 10 weeks away, I'm fairly surprised that I am not yet panicking (or revising..) Well, it's only a German exam, so not too bad. This morning I've been doing some Business Studies homework - very dull. Who wants to know about the growth of firms anyway? And yesterday was fun, fun english homework. 'What different approaches or attitudes to death are explored in Tichbourne's Elergy, Mid Term Break and at least one other poem of your choice' Believe me, that was far from fun, despite the fact that half of it had already been written onto the board by teacher good ol' Mr Herbert. ('Look boys, I'm reeeeealy starting to panic now, we absolutely haven't got time for this, the exams are a matter of weeeeks away, believe me, this time is going to fly by' (Welsh accent, of course!)) Oh yes, and maths homwork of course. That was... interesting. Something called 'integration', trying to find gradients of lines and the like. The class on Friday was as usual..(Shut up, yeah? talking... *shakes head, stern look on face*) Ah, and geography of course (hmmm, impression of geograohy teacher... errr 'Can you just try and focus? I'll be very interested to see your parents on parents evening' (That wasn't a particually good impression) The homework wasn't too bad 'produce a leaflet to inform people of the water quality issues in the world. You must then discuss the possible management strategies that could be use to make water more sustainable' Well, that took me about an hour of very boring research (copy and pasting) and organising it all nicely, but the finished result looks ok. And finally there's German. (I'm not even going to try and do an impression of my German teacher.. she is... fairly normal) I should have learnt about words for a vocab test... but that would be boring so I've skipped that. Well, that's been my weekend, other than browsing nationstates, neopets, and a forum me and my friends have.   I haven't been outside the house since Friday comming home from school (what a sad life I lead) and I doubt I will leave untill 0740 when I leave for school tomorrow. Oh, I have to fill out my 6th Form application form this afternoon so that I can stay on at school for a further two years. I have decided to take Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Computing. A fairly solid choice I think. Well, that will be all for now, I'm running out of things to say.... Ta Ta all.

      Only posted yesterday, but hey! I'm bored. Not really much to talk about... School was... fine. This is rather funny though: Dickybod, during the course of the past 2 years has been in my english class, and had not been doing his essays. Tut tut. A sensible person like me did the essay as soon as we finished the topic in class, so that all the good information was fresh in my mind. But Dickybod... Well. He did one essay in good time - the creative writing one, but left all the others until the night before, amazingly foolish. 4 essays in one night. As you can immagine, he didn't get them done. So, Thursday's English lesson came, Mr Herbert walks up to our desk, 'Look, Richard, I reeeeealy need these essays in, have you got them...?' 'Errr, well I stayed up late last night and did 2 of them by hand, and my writing isn't very legible... if I could just have one more day...' 'Yeh, ok Richard, but I reeealy must have those in tomorrow' 'Yep, sure sir, definately tomorrow'. Well, the next day, Friday came, and all looked good. Dickybod had remembered his essays and handed them in first thing in the morning. We thought it was all over, but the terror would come back to haunt us again. Well, not us. I don't care about his essays. Over the weekend, dickybod found one essay that had somehow escaped his schoolbag on friday morning. He had forgotten one essay. Dun dun duhhhh. And which one was it? The Psycho one of course!     This was bad, especially as the essays were being moderated first thing monday morning. Well, this morning at break, dickybod handed the one remaining essay in. And that was that. No shouting, no detention. Sir was fine with it. Pity.. I wanted some action. Oh well. I've resorted to talking about other peoples lives now, as my life is so amazingly boring. Boring day. Nothing to say. Bye all.   Playing:  Nothing  Listening To:   Star Wars CD  Watching:  Nothing  Annoyed With:  Nothing really  Confused About:  Nothing really  Mood:  Normal.

      It has come to my attention, again, that I need a hobby. One that doesn't involve sitting in front of the computer all day. After doing a bit of homework yesterday, I spent pretty much from 13:00 until I went to bed on the computer. Probably about 6 hours in all, the occasional stop for dinner and a look through the revision guide. Finally coming to my senses at about 20:00, I felt my eyes tired and aching, head was hurting... argh, it was horrible. I don't want to repeat that again in a hurry. A lot of the time was spent on neopets (yes, I know, it is a 12 year old girl's game) on the chat boards, discussing the existence of ghosts and demons. No doubt you can guess my stance immediately. (If you can't guess, I was dead [no pun intended] against the idea). They suggested I take a look at  urlLink this website . It contains photos of ghosts, which somehow managed to convince too many people of the existence of ghosts. Can't think why, the pictures are absolutely terrible. (I would post pictures from the site here, but I don't know how to yet. Using the [IMG]  and [/IMG] tags didn't seem to work.) Not very convincing eh? The discussion/flat out argument went on with me saying how pictures such as this could easily be made on simple photo-editing software, or specks of dust and water on the camera lense, or creases in the film or something. It's amazing how gullible some people are...  Anyway, back to the original topic of me needing a hobby... I don't really want it to involve a computer, as I spend way too much time on the computer already. I don't really like meeting new people, or playing sports, which rules out quite a few activities. Maybe something inside... chess maybe. Or reading. But I can do those already, I have a nearby library, aswell as a chess computer, but I don't. I was looking browsing  urlLink How Stuff Works  yesterday and came across an article on ham radio, which could be quite interesting. Apparently people all over the world communicate on these hand-held radio things, quite ingenious really, although I could get a mobile phone, which would do the job much better. But then where's the fun with a phone when you can use ham radio? But you need to get a license and pass a test, which kind of spoils the fun. Well, whatever my hobby turns out to be, it will have to wait until after the exams. Bye for now.   Playing:  Played 'Tetris' on the Gameboy last night, fairly good.

      Haven't blogged for a while, nothing's been happening really in that dull place that is my mind. Went back to school on Monday, late start at 0900. Everything's been fairly normal since then. Didn't do any revision after school in the evenings, but did some homework. Err, that's about my whole week explained. Didn't go out any where, no interesting days at school... Well, I've done a bit of physics revision this morning, and I'm feeling more confident about it than I was a few weeks ago when doing those tests. I really need to do some maths revision at some point, haven't done any yet. Maths is generally fairly easy though.  Enough about that, I reccomend this:  urlLink everybuddy . If you join up, every time you change your msn name, it will be put on the site for all to see, and you can see every one elses. Well, I liked it anyway. This is also well worth a read, if I haven't told you about it already:  urlLink Molecules with silly or unusual names . Very funny. I'll probably put these links on the side aswell.  Well, physics books are lying open beside me, and I really don't want to learn theat boring stuff. Even though it's probably the most interesting subject there is. Maybe maths. I'd better do some work, or I'll feel guilty. Meh, I'll do a bit more physics. Bye for now.

      I have decided to come and write here again, despite the fact I have nothing of interest to say.  Firstly, I removed the earthquake generator thing, after complaints from Megatrobe and Dickybod.  Well, I stayed in the house all day again (what fun!), and have finished the first of the physics tests I had to do, and done about half of the second one. Only half, because it is very very very difficult. Physics extension. The horror! If I'm very lucky, Megatrobe or Nonnesuch will tell me the answers before Wednesday, if they managed to do any better than I did. Looks like I need to revise physics more. Or start. Yes, that would be a good idea. And geography.  Had a good read of www.thingsmygirlfriendandihavearguedabout.com (Haven't quite worked out how to put links here yet). I'll put a link on the side of this page, if you don't want to copy and paste this one. I'm probably more than 2/3 through it now (it's very long), and it's very interesting. I reccomend you to have a  read.  Not much more to say right now, I'll write a longer post when something interesting happens.   Playing:  Nothing again.

      Afternoon all. I bring my readers good news. I FINSHED MY BUSINESS TESTS! WOO! Par-tay. Or not. I HATE parties... Well, that's all my work for the day, those tests are damn hard, and ot show how bad they were, and the torture I went throught the past 2 days, here is another taster: 'Why might Flaxtons consider the out of town site to be an improvement on its existing town centre location' (10 marks) and 'How might Paul and Kate try to deal with the changes in the break even indicated' (12 marks) THERE WERE LOADS OF THEM. Arghhh, the pain, the pain.... I curse the day I chose business studies as one of my options.  Anyway, in other matters, I got my hair cut this morning. 'Bout time, it was getting long. Now it it nice and short, and hopefully I can put off getting it cut again untill after the exams, but probably shortly after we break up from school. £9 that cost me! £9! What a waste... Even though my parents will probably pay for it, but still. £9! I should learn to cut my own hair, save me a bit of money.  Also, started reading 'Catch-22' last night, and got through about 3 chapters (about 35 pages). Ok, I'm a slow reader. It seems ok, not great. It'll probably get better though. It better do. I would have liked to get a good DiscWorld book out. Now, they are very good. If you haven't read them, I definatly reccomend them. If you like fantasy. A lot. If you like a slushy romance or crappy crime book, then don't bother.   And back to business studies. Owwww! Why is it so hard and boring? It's horrible, learning facts about the government, economy, balance sheets urgh, the list goes on. And Geograhy! That's possible just as bad. And don't get me started on English...   This is just turning into waffle/rant so I'll stop now. Bye my good fans! And keep reading, more to follow shortly.   Playing: Nothing at the moment. Windows Media Player, does that count? No?

      Went to the Library this morning for the first time in over a year. Got out 'Catch-22' - supposedly a very good book. Well, I'll see about that...  And I did the first one of two business studies practice exams I had to do. Fairly hard, mainly because it has loads of questions requiring long answers such as 'Describe the business objectives that Peter might have for his family's firm' (8 marks). That test took ages, probably much more than the 90 minutes it was supposed to take. Stupid subject... Oh well, not long until I never have to do another busiess, geography, english or german test ever again. Only about 10 weeks and the exams will all be over. 10 weeks.... *drool*....Wow. That time went fast. It's been 5 years since I joined the school in year 7, and in 10 weeks it will all be over. 10 weeks... That's worryingly not much. I REALLY need to sort out some decent revision process.  Not much else to say.... can I think of anything...? If I don't keep writing this, I haven't really got much else to do on the computer, and if I haven't got anything to do on the computer I get very bored. And I'm not doing any more revision as that business test exhausted me mentally. Oooh, I could read Catch-22... yes, I think I'll do that. Ta ta all.

      Revision getting dull again. Business Studies. Two full tests to do before Tuesday (one week, so  should get them done). Then there's physics. 1 full test to do, one half test to do before Wednesday (I generally find physics one of the easiest subjects, so that shouldn't be too bad too. And geography.....  I would like to point out that the link to Megatrobe's blog now seems to be more... 'attractive' than the others, but don't let this fool you, his is far from the best. Personally, I would say mine is the best of the blogs I have read (I would say that), but also Dickybod's and Stommp's are also worth a read. I'll put a link to the latter one later. I should really post about something else here other than just what I do, as these events can get boring to read after a few minutes.   In the past few days I've been thinking about what I would like to do after A-Levels. I really have barely any idea what I want to do. I've been considering university, although is it really worth it? It's very expensive, especially if you live away from home, and apparently graduates from university have great difficulty finding a job, especially a high paid one, relating to the degree that they did. So, it may be simpler and easier just to give university a miss and go straight into employment at 18. Get a low-down job, and work your way up to the better ones from the inside. I'll probably just be stuck in an office though, which isn't really my ideal job. Previously I was thinking about some sort of Engineering job, drawing structural drawings of buildings and designing bridges. That could be fairly interesting, but it would probably be difficult to get a job after university. The most common advise is to do what you like doing, but (as you may already know) I don't really have any hobbeys or interests. I really should get one at some point.  Well, at least I'm sorted for the next two years. Staying on at Sixth Form, as I don't know what else to do. I decided to choose Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Computing. I'm not quite sure why I chose computing, as I'm not particually good at it, and normally end up just copying Megatrobe the whole time. I don't know how to make a macro on Word, or how the school networking works. Probably because the only other subject I was considering was biology, and I've had more than enough of that over the past 2 years.   Not much else to say for now, so that will be all.

      Time to blog again, quite a bit's happened since Friday (well, slightly more than usual), it now being Monday and all. Saturday was dull, and I didn't do much. I think (if I can remember correctly), that I did some biology revision. Oh yes, that was it. All about genetics, which we haven't done anything about during class. Foolish teacher. Chromosomes, DNA, zygotes, it all gets very confusing, especially if you are learning it for the first time. That took a while, and, oh yes, I remember what happened. My sister has been back from university for Easter, and she was using the computer all day, and that was why I was so bored. Wow, what a sad life I lead - reduced to boredom when being prevented of computer usage. I really need to find some sort of a hobbey, other than internet browsing. And revsion. Reading I suppose, but that's not really a hobbey. I don't play any sports, which I probably should, as I probably don't get enough exercise (he says as he scoffs down a Cadbury's Cream Egg - half price in Sainsburys apparently) - but as you may have read in a previous blog, I hate nearly all sports I have tried. Oh well, bugger hobbeys. I'm sure I'll manage.  Sunday was different to the normal day, being as I went down to Bristol again, to take my sister to university in my other sister's car. And... SERVICE STATIONS!!!! I need a rant about those somewhere. Seemingly ok from the outside, but terrifyingly (sp?) expensive on the inside. £4 for a baguette! We ended up getting two and having 2/3 of one each, plus 2 coffees, again, drastically expensive. I really should open my own. You can charge whatever you like, and a lot of people will buy the stuff anyway as there is nowhere else to go. Very Price Inelastic (there you go business studies teacher - I knew I would get that in a sentence one day). Well, after the painfully expensive lunch, we headed on towards the small-ish city on the mouth of the River Severn. Arriving there, I had a go on the computer (22 mb broadband.... drool...) and then in the evening my sisters took/dragged me to the cinema to see 'Scooby Doo 2' - a fairly abysmal film, no-where near as good as the first one, which wasn't very good. Predictable, bad story line, terrible jokes... couldn't even raise a snigger from me. Cinema was nice though. Comfy seats, with loads of leg-room. Not like that damn poetry conference the english teachers took us to...(wait 'til I get 'em... stupid cheap seats.... think they can get away with that... I'll show 'em... legs crammed up against the back of the seat infront.... stupid... kill 'em...) although the place was a bit dirty, and the cleaners were only picking up rubbish 10 minutes before the film was sheduled to start. That's another thing! I really hate people who leave their rubbish in cinemas after a film. I ALWAYS take my rubbish and put it in the bin, at least, if I had any - I never buy food in cinemas, way too expensive. Well, back to the house by 22:00, and I slept in a spare room (all the other residents of the shared house were away).   And then this morning I came back with the older of my two sisters. Decided to eat lunch before we went this time. After a quick stop at Tesco on the way back, we got home at about 17:00. Dinner, and now here I am. That's about all for today folks, ta ta.

      Dave is back on the computer. So, what to write about... Well, yesterday I went into Bromley with my mum, and bought my sister a few birthday presents. I'd better not say what they were in case she reads this. Anyway, that took up all the morning. Since then I've been dividing my time into revising, playing on the computer, eating and sleeping. I started to get a bit worried this morning though, as I flicked through the geography revision guide. I was amazed at how little of it I think I know. With the science ones,especially chemistry and physics, I probably know a lot of it already, and it only took about 3 days to read through and feel confident with the chemistry one - even with spending most of the time playing on computer and watching tv. But geography... I don't seem to know any of it. Probably less than a quarter I know already. So this means that I will actually have to properly revise it, read it, makes notes, re-read, remember etc. Wow, and there's over 100 pages to it. Wow. I'm buggered. So, after about 20 pages of it I gave up, being immensely bored.   This morning I did a bit more geograohy revision, that was before I gave up earlier today. When that got boring, I did a bit of biology. That also soon got boring. So, it was computer time, followed by a lunch, an extened episode of 'Diagnosis Murder' and 'Back to the Future Part 1' - even though I must have seen that film at least 5 times before. And now here I sit, nothing on tv, and revision looking difficult. Oh well. During the mock exams in December I managed to get a grade B on geography, and that was without revising, so with a bit of revision hopefully I will get an A. Even if I don't, a B is still good. At least I already have my A* in Maths. Woooo! Oh Yeh!!!!! Take that, Nonnesuch and Megatrobe! Sorry, I promised I wouldn't gloat any more. I haven't really got anything to say, so that will be all for today.

      Afternoon all. Time for another blog methinks.   Well, I went to London with my dad this morning, mainly so I could get a book on Esperanto from one of those big book shops. Looked in 2 of them, NEITHER OF THEM HAD ANYTHING ON ESPERANTO! Chiz. So, it took a while to get to Charring Cross station to start with. Then, just as we were getting off the train, my dad spotted a mobile phone on the carraige floor. So, we picked it up and decided to hand it in to the lost property place. We spent about 10 minutes looking round for it, after some guard grunted and pointed vaguely into the station when we asked him about it. Looking round the station, it suddenly rang. Dad answered, and it turned out the owner had rung it. We reassured him it would be handed into lost property.   Next was a 20 minute walk towards the 2 bookshops I had planned to go in. Blackwells and Foyles. Spent about 30 minutes in them overall, looking for a book that wasn't there. Then a train to Canary Warf; my dad insisted I see the nice new shops there. Spent about 15 minutes looking round them. Took Docklands Light Railway back to Lewisham, then a long bus jorney into Bromley. And the whole way (about 30 mins) there were these REALLY ANNOYING boys sitting behind me, about 5, 6, and 7 years old. 5 of them in all, I think. With 2 adults, probably mums. They were talking really loudly, and saying things such as 'spell cat' 'ok then. C-A-T' and then, 'spell bus' 'ok, B-U-S' ARGH, it was SOOOOOO annoying. I hate children. Bah, Humbug! Anyway, then at Bromley South Station we waited about 15 minutes for a train to take us back to Beckenham Junction. So, after about 4 hours from leaving the house, we got back, having bought only some tran tickets. That was my whole morning.   Decided to do a bit more biology revision when I got back. Now that was dull, but better than sitting in front of those annoying kids on the bus. So, after a bit of revision, I watched tv. 'Diagnosis Murder', a crime series set in a hospital. It's actually not bad. Makes something to do. If you're interested, it's on every weekday on BBC1 at 14:35. I generally watch it every day I can.   Well, now I'm back to being bored again. May do a bit of revision, although watching a Star Wars video is much more appealing... I watched Episode 6 yesterday, so it only makes sense to watch Epidode 1 today. But that one wasn't all that good. In fact, it was pretty terrible. Damn little Anakin. I hated that little kid. Bah, Humbug! And that Speeder race was boring. And Jar Jar Binks was annoying. Maybe episode 2... slghtly better than Episode 1. Or 4 or 5 even. Or maybe something completely different. Like revision. But that's sooo boring. Ok, Episode 2 it is. Bye Bye all.   Playing:  Actually, I was playing 'Cool Borders 3' for the PlayStation yesterday. Rather dull.

      I decided to take another break from revision. If you can call it that. I've been meerly reading through the revision guide for chemistry, which is extremely dull. Although, it probably has helped a bit; I now know the difference between an alkane and an alkene. Yep, it's that fun. I kind of gave up when I got to the section on calculations and realised I didn't know how to do even the simple calculations, but meh. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it at some point - probably several months after the exams. I may do a bit of business revision, because I reallly don't know much about that. IT'S ALL SO CONFUSING!!! Or boring. Or both. And the only reason I'm writing this is because I don't want to do any more revision.   Well, last night I made several attempts to improve the features of this blog, all ended in utter failure. I tried rainbow text, wavy text, drop-down-from-top text, fly-from-side text and many others. None worked, so I just left it how it was before I truly mucked the whole thing up.   I watched 'Good Will Hunting' last night. It was ok, about what I expected. There isn't really a lot to say about it; some kid descovers he's a maths genius but doesn't want to use his gift. Anyway, haven't got anything to say, so I'm off. ta ta.   Playing:   I don't play games  Listening To:  Burly Brawl Music  Watching:   Nought.

      Well, the trip to the moving pictures to see 'Scooby Doo 2' was cancelled as my sisters prefer to go out with their frineds than to take their little brother to the cinema. Meh, Dickybod assures me it wouldn't have been that good anyway. Anyway, good news! I did that geography essay. Apparently it was Antigua. And the German! Badly. But hey, I'm not doing German next year, so no worries. I also did do a bit of revision. I read a few pages of the chemistry revision guide! *Cue Fanfare, marching band and several dancing elephants* Other than that, I haven't really been doing much today. Browsing the internet again as usual. Watched that 'Super Mario Reloaded' cartoon from Newgrounds - Damn well made. You can probably do a google search for it if you're that bothered, or just ask me. Oh, I know something else I can say: Yesterday a film called 'Guys and Dolls' was on, and being bored, I decided to watch it. All 2 and a half hours of it. Mainly because there were a few references to it in a Simpsons episode once. It wasn't very good. A boring love story set in that awful place known as the 'USA'. I also watched about 45 minutes of 'The Godfather' on Friday night. There wasn't any violence in the part I watched so I gave up and went to sleep. Supposedly it is good though... Oh, I just recomended this site to a friend of mine who is convinced light speed is possible. It has now convinced him otherwise: http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/sr.html. Or maybe he is just saying that to shut me up... Anyway, enjoy it, it's all I have to show you today.

      I really should be doing my geography homework, 'To What Extent Has Tourist Development in an LEDC Benefited the Local Population?' but I got bored of that as soon as I realised I couldn't remember the name of the country we were studying in class, and, as that's kind of the main point of the essay, I gave up after a brief introduction. Alternatively I could do my German homework, answering about 15 boring questions, but I'm not going to do that either. Yet. Then there's that thing called 'revision'. Generally done in the weeks proceeding rather important exams. But you guessed it, I'm not going to do that either. Yet. But then, what is there left to do? Well, I believe that I will be going to the cinema later today with my older sisters to see 'Scooby Doo 2' which could be good. The first one wasn't too bad. Ok, the ending was predicable and the same as always: *pulls off rubber mask* 'It was the manager!' 'Yes, and I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you damn kids' 'So it was you who was frightening away the customers with you costume so that you could smuggle these goods!' But hey, it'll make my sisters happy. I'll do a review of it tonight when I get back.   So, I check my MSN contacts list and discover there are only 2 people online, fairly good friends from school, but I haven't really got anything to say to them. Megatrobe has supposedly gone on holiday for a week, (not quite sure why I said that, it's not as if you care is it?'), and I'm stuck in my house for all of the Easter Break. Not that I'm complaining of course, rather here than at school. Suddenly I remember: I have 2 business studies practice exams and 2 physics practice exams to do over the holidays. My, that will be dull. Ah, someone else has just signed into Messenger. A slightly better friend than the other 2, but I still have nothing to say to him. My God, I'm bored. Just had a look at DickyBods blog. Hey, you forgot to put a link to megatrobe's and Steffie's Blog, as well as the 'contact me' link. Also, please inform me of where you got the code for that Matrix thing. Please? Inspired by him, I will also now include that sig he used at the end of each blog. Ta Ta.

      Well, I decided to remove the lottery number generator, and the auto start on the music, mainly because of complaints from Dickybod. The fool.   Anywho, I'm now on Easter Holiday, woo! But that means lots of revision, ney. Supposedly. I had better do some at some point. Today was very normal. Had an assemly during half of first lesson, and then my class watched some of a really weird film: Battle Royale. Very sick, possibly disturbing. However I would quite like to see the end at some time. Had half day, school finished at 13:00, home by 13:45. My God, I'm bored, and I've only been home 3 and a half hours. My Easter holiday will be dull. I have nothing to say here, so I'll be orff then, bye all.

      About that post I made a few days ago, where I mentioned my intentions to have a certain individual... eliminated... due to terrible music in her neopet shop. Well, you may as well not go to the links I put, as it is not there anymore. Looks like the account was frozen. Just like mine really... BIGGUS DICKUS ISN'T EVEN RUDE!!! The good point is that the music isn't there, and so no-one else will have to be subjected to its tortures.  I watched Star Wars IV - A New Hope on video this morning, being bored as I was, and not wanting to do revision. A rather good film, even it is blindingly obvious that a Storm Trooper smashes his head on a low door... Also watched Jurassic Park earlier this evening, which was also rather good.   Finally, I managed to get about half an hours revision in today, which was basically just reading through old geography exercise books. Personally, I don't really see how the eruption of Mount St Helens will ever affect me, but meh, that's geography for you. At least it's not drama. I mean, at least geography may come in a little useful, but drama! What a waste of time... you'd have to be a real fool to do that as a subject. It's just like...

      Another rant I think. Today it shall be about reality tv programmes, and has been inspired by the release of Big Brother series 5! Series 5! Ok, the first series was different, it hadn't been seen before and so made a change of regular tv programmes. But did they really have to do it again? Then again? And then 2 more times?!?! It is proably the most pathetic programme I have ever seen; just a group of about 10 people locked in a house for a few months. They're not actors, entertainers, they're just normal people, wanting to have a tiny bit of false fame. Within a few weeks out of the house, I bet no one cares about them at all, and then we start again with a new series. Then they say things like 'I wanted to see if I could handle the challenge' CHALLENGE?!?!?! WHERE IS THE CHALLENGE IN THAT? What I would like to know is why are so many people attracted to watching this junk. And it's not just Big Brother. Things like 'Pop Idol' 'Fame Academy' 'Castaway' 'Survivor' and countless others. They are just normal people! Where is the entertainment value in that? And then I wake up this morning, put the radio on, and what are the presenters talking about? Yep, discussing the people who went into the Big Brother House last night. Well, I for one refuse to watch any of it.  Oh, I also managed to watch about 3 minutes of something called 'How Clean Is Your House?' This was possibly even more pathetic than Big Brother. It featured 2 women going to someones house and... cleaning it! Dun Dun Duuuuuuun! What is the point of such a rubbish programme? Do tv producers really think we have nothing better to do that watch people clean a house? Or in the case of Big Brother, LIVE IN A HOUSE??? And then there's 'The Salon' I've never watched more than about 20 seconds of it, but from what I saw, and from what I've heard, it features.... people getting their hair cut! (which reminds me, I must get mine done this half term at some point) How can people watch that! What is so good about watching what goes on inside a hair dressers? Terrible, terrible... Gone are the good programmes with propper actors... not like the good ol' days...  On another note, I have recently found the lyrics to the Star Wars music 'Duel of the Fates' If you're interested, here they are. Feel free to sing along.  Korah matah korah rahtahmah  Korah rahtahmah yoodah korah Korah syahdho rahtahmah daanyah Korah keelah daanyah Nyohah keelah korah rahtahmah Syadho keelah korah rahtahmah Korah daanya korah rahtahmah   Korah daanya korah rahtahmah Nyohah keelah korah rahtahmah Syadho keelah korah rahtahmah Korah   Korah matah korah rahtahmah   Korah daanya korah rahtahmah Nyohah keelah korah rahtahmah Syadho keelah korah rahtahmah Korah   I think it's a language 'Sanskrit'  Oh, I had my English Literature exam yesterday. It wasn't too bad actualy. And now, NO MORE SEAMUS HEANEY, GILLIAN CLARKE OR OF MICE AND MEN. EVER AGAIN! WOOOOO!!!  I had better do some revision this half term...

      It has come to my attention that revision is boring. But it has to be done. I'm fairly proud of myself today, I've gone through the whole first chapter of the Seperates Sciences revision book, and learnt most of it. Oh how interesting it all is, about micro-organisms and how to preserve food, and what happens at a sewage works. Yep, I'm glad I learnt all that. No, really, I am. I bet none of this stuff will even come up on the exam, and then it would all have been for nothing. But it may do, so I better learn the rest of it. If I can get the next chapter or so done this afternoon, I should be going fairly well. However, I   SHOULD  be revising for a German listening exam, which happens to start in about 22 hours. But then HOW exactly do you revise for that? A glance through my exercise book won't do much. I suppose I could learn some vocabulary, but that would be amazingly boring. I'll probably just have a look through my book, to re-assure myself that I actually did do some revision.  In other news (I like that phrase) I have been continuing to practice my skills on a diabalo, which isn't too hard. I can now catch it probably about 3/5 throws. Although I have been trying some higher throws which proove to be more difficult. And then sometims the string gets all tangled up. Meh, all it takes is a bit of practice.  Oh, and I just played one of the most annoying games I have ever played. You can find it  urlLink here . It took me well over an hour to complete it, and it has a really terrible ending. And that was WITH a walk-through guide, although I only used it towards the end when it got really tough.

      Haven't really done a lot today. Did a fair amount of geography revision, which is possibly one of the most boring subjects there are (apart from business anyway). I have however, been having a go at a diabalo thing I have, which I haven't used in ages. If you don't know what it is, this is one of the only pictures I could find of them:     It's easy to make it spin and then throw it up from the string, the difficult part is trying to catch it before it breaks a priceless vase. Luckily, we have no priceless vases in the house.  I've also recently re-discovered the computer game of Caesar III. Although it's old, it's very good, and also very addictive. I was playing it for several hours last night, completing the next level. I'm a bit out of practice though, it was taking me ages to build up any decent city, but I got there in the end. I shouldn't really be playing computer games though, I do have exams starting very, very soon. I probably should revise more. Meh, there's a lot of things I should probably do. And I did well on my mocks without revising at all. Well, nothing below B grades anyway. As long as I get good maths and science grades I'll be happy. Who cares about English, business, geography and German? Ok, universities might, but meh. I'll worry about them when the time comes. Who knows, I may not even go to university. And then all that work would have been for nothing. So I must now concentrate on maths and science, as they are what I am doing for A-level.  I also did a bit of English revision this morning. Actually, I only annotated a few poems in my Anthology. But I don't plan to do a lot of revision for English. If I have most of the notes in my Anthology, I don't need to memorize them. And you're either good at writing essays about them or you're not. Luckily, I'm fairly good. I managed to get an average grade B on the mock, which I thought was quite good.  Oh, and for some weird reason, I also plan to learn to write with my left hand this summer. I considered it may be slightly useful.  And another random point, I recently came into possession of a song that I thought was fairly good, apparently by Monty Python. It's good, if you don't mind a little swearing. Ok, a lot of swearing. In fact, nearly the entire thing is swearing. It  IS  good though. The lyrics:  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  I'm Rudolph and I quit.  Just who's he think he is?  That little fat c**t sat back in the sleigh,  crackin' that f****n' whip.  And me stuck up the front, with these other useless c**ts,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  (Chorus)  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  And what about us elves,  we've had enough as well,  workin' in that freezing factory, it's cold as f*****g hell,  we work until we drop, with our bollocks freezin' off,  stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  (Chorus)  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  I'm Santa Claus' wife,  I know what he's really like,  sneakin into them little kid's rooms  he's a f****n' paedophile,  A devious old drunk,  and I'm married to the c**t,  So stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  (Chorus)  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.    Trust me, it is good. Honest...  That's about all for today. Goodbye, my devoted readers.

But revision is soooo boring. I'll do a bit of business, biology, and maybe a bit of maths. Probably a little of all the other subjects at some later date.  I would like to do a rant, as I haven't done one for ages, but what about? What about indeed...?

      Being very bored at the moment, I decided to do another blog, despite the fact I have nothing to say. However, I do have some good news.  ONE MORE DAY OF SCHOOL LEFT!!!  Just one more day... 4 hours of lessons, followed by what will no doubt be an exceptionally boring assembly, where the head-teacher will rant on about how we should be revising hard, befriending dictionaries and looking after our brooms. Yes, he is that weird.  My last ever business lesson was good. Other than going through past papers, we were each given 2 chocolates each, which was very kind of our teacher. Geography was as crap as usual, teacher being his moody self. There were probably a record number of 'for f***s sake...' phrases from the English teacher, but we couldn't add them to the tally, as the results had already been typed up the night before. We handed the results from 5 months study to him today after school. He looked fairly shocked, but also amused. Played softball (again!) in games, rather dull. Never was very good at sports. But hopefully last ever games lesson.

      So, here is my 50th post. Shazaam! Well, that was fun.   MY GERMAN ORAL  was not as bad as i thought it would be. Phew. Better not give too many details away, but I had a fairly easy role-play, and the general conversation was ok. I kind of buggered up my presentation half way through, but I managed to recover. I understood most of the questions, although I probably started repeating myself towards the end. Glad that it's over. Sorry Megatrobe, but: Hahahahaha, you have to do yours tomorrow. Wow, I never have to utter a word of German again, only read it. Meh, I'll manage.

      So Teh Dickyblog has 1000 hits, and I have just over a meer 300. Oh well.  In other news, I have a German oral exam in... less than 15 hours. Wow. That's not much. I've done a little revision for it. Well, I memorised the presentation, and had a glance over some practice questions. I really should probably have done more, but hey! It's only German. If I fail (I won't fail) then I fail. But I'm not feeling too bad about it, my practice went ok. And the good presentation should get me a few marks even if I do totally bugger up the 6 minute conversation. Bugger Bugger Bugger Bugger Bugger Bugger.

      I don't really know why I decided to come to this site again today, nothing interesting has happened since last time I blogged.  However, I have been thinking about my social life, and come to a good, firm conclusion that it is, in fact... non-existent. I've worked out I probably go out with my friends about once every 3 or 4 months. Yes, it is that bad. Dickybod goes out to some sort of youth club once a week (I think) and so do some of my other friends. I don't think megatrobe goes out very often, and nonnesuch doesn't either. Probably more than I do though. I came to be thinking about my situation after I declined the offer from a few boys at school in my science classes to go to a party, being held at some stranger's (to me)house, probably more than 5 miles away. The offer was initially given to nonnesuch, who not-so-politely declined, and as I managed to get involved, they invited me to. As I already said, I declined the offer, mainly because I was under the impression there would be loud music, alcohol, smoking and... other strange stuff that is totally alien to my life. My impression was correct. I was given a brief description of the party today at school, and it definitely didn't sound like the sort of place I belong. I was sort-of glad I refused the offer, although should I have? I do need a social life, and I wasn't doing anything of interest that evening (watching the Eurovision wasn't interesting). But music? Alcohol? Smoking? Probably best I didn't go, as that would have been a sign of giving in to peer pressure. Which  IS  a bad thing. Yes, probably best I didn't go...  In other news, I have a German oral exam on Wednesday. So I should be panicking, but I'm not. I'm not feeling to bad about it actually.   And I shall replace the 'playing' title with 'reading' in my signiture, as I rarely 'play' games.   Reading:  Interesting Times  Listening to:  Prince Ali!

      While I remember, two rather amusing happenings happened (maybe not the best choice of words there) when I was at Sainsburys supermarket in Beckenham yesterday. These both made me struggle not to laugh, as the people involved were less than 3 meters away, but now in the safety of my own home, I can blog about these people for the whole world to read. :)  1. As we (me and big sis) were queing up to pay at the checkout, who should walk up to the counter next to ours but *dun dun da daaaaaa!* The Checkout Captain! Who just happened to be wearing the bright orange fleece, with the words 'Checkout Captain' in large, bright blue letters on the back :) She must have been so very proud! Immagine: You checkout is broken, no-one else can help, maybe you should call... THE CHECKOUT CAPTAIN (Hint of The A Team there). What do you think she wold write on the national census? Ocupation: Checkout Captain? Ahh, the laughs I had... probably just some strange form of motivation, to make the workers feel needed.  Moving on to number 2 amusing event...  2. Waiting for the lift up to the carpark. You may or may not know (probably not) there are 3 lifts leading up to the carpark above the store. 1 lift is for staff with trollies only. Leaving 2 left. As we walk up to them, we press the button for the middle lift, as the one on the left is for staff, and the one on the right has a piece of bright yellow tape accross the doors saying, in BLACK CAPITAL LETTERS  DANGER. DO NOT USE.  We waited about 30 seconds, then who should come out of the right hand lift but a large, old man wearing a bright yellow coat, pushing a trolly who then says to us 'Oh, don't use this one, it isn't working' I resist the urge to point out the brighy yellow notice on the lift door and say something along the lines of 'blind idiot'. So, the middle lift finally arrives, and we all get it. Me and my sister, the stupid old man, a young woman and another old man, all with trollies. We're all in the lft, the first old man pushes the buttons. He then starts to make small talk to us all, in the confined volume of the lift. 'Did you know they're going to do some building work on the church down the road? Yes, it was about time some work was done on it' He didn't get a reply. Maybe just a nod, and posibly a smile.   Well, me and my sister joked about these evemts all the way home in the car. What laughs we had...

      I'm rather pissed off today. My  urlLink Neopets  account was frozen yesterday for posting the words 'Biggus Dickus' on a message board. Apparently that counts as bad language. But it's barely even rude, and I was only quoting a Monty Python film! So now I have to spend all sumemr trying to get my account back to how it was, which took me about 14 months to get. I'll aim to do it in half the time. It's not fair...

      Mornin' all. Currently I am in a computer lesson and very bored, so I thought I may as well do another blog, even if this keyboard is very difficult to type on. Well, as I guessed yesterday, my legs do ache a bit, but probably not as much as last year. Just completed a game of Mind Maze on Encarta, with a bit of help from megatrobe and someone else called Dan. Errr, haven't really got much to sat, so ta ta for now.

      Hm, could do another blog...  Watched 'Battle Royale' a few nights ago, which was a... weird film. Sick and twisted are probably the best words to describe it. Even though I had seen a small section of it before, I still decided to stay up past 01:00 with school the next day (or the same day, if you want to be clever). If anyone doesn't know, it features a group of kids from Japan (yes, it had to be a Japanese film didn't it? Only they could make such a sick film) who have been put on a deserted island and have to kill each other by any and all means neccessary. Each is given a random weapon, and if more than one person lives at the end, they all die. And each person is wearing a neck collar that explodes if the disobey. And it was in Japanese, with sub-titles. Very graphic. Lots of blood.  Had sports day today, they made me enter for the 200m sprint and the 100m relay race. Managed to come an ok 5th out of 8 in the 200m and our team of 4 came 7th in the relay. Sports day was very dull, but hey, we missed an English lesson. And a games lesson, but we were doing sports anyway... But as I haven't properly sprinted for about a year (last sports day in fact, where I did the same races) I am very unfit, and my legs will probably be aching for a week, well, they did last year anyway. I hate sports.

      I have some sad news. It was revealed to me today that... dickybod... is a dis-believer in the Commi Nazi. In English today, he did swear at it, he did also make rude gestures towards it. And... *sob* he also drew a picture of it and did rip it and pierce it, and.. he ate it. I know this is sad news to all. The shock comes as I think to myself that I may be the one remaining worshipper of the Commi Nazi. When I am gone (about 1,825,000,000 seconds -  urlLink www.deathclock.com ) He will have no followers. He will be alone. He will be non-existant with no-one to worship Him. I... I can't go on... *sob*    Playing:  Nothing  Listening to:  Lighthouse Family - Ocean Drive  Watching:  Battle Royale tonight. - Or I may video it. Yes, it's on rather late.

      *The Davester drearily thinks of something to blog about...*  Maybe I could follow dickybod's lead and write about stuff that isn't real...? Do you think he's mind? Probably, but I may do it anyway. At some point. Not now. Another time.  This morning was as dull as ever. Learnt my German Oral presentation in about 20 minutes, but I still have to look at some of those practice questions and 'think' of some answers to them. But why should I do that when I know that the only other person to do so will be megatrobe, and the teacher won't be able to prove if we've done it anyway. I may do it a little, spend about 15 minutes on it. Later. The same with English homework, which Mr 'Opf boyyys' Herbert set last lesson. Just to do a sheet I think, but I know that if I do it I will be the only one who has, and I mean the only one. Not even dickybod or deutsches will. I may do it though because I really could do with the revision. But thinking about that, I have all the notes for the poems anyway, and as I have the notes in the antology book during the exam, there's not a great deal of point revising. Again, I may do a little. Later.   Oh, I finished that chemistry test this afternoon (about 20 minutes ago), wasn't too hard. I'm feeling fairly confident about chemistry, but a shame I can't say the same about biology. That test was hard. Meh, I'll do a bit more revision. Later. :) In other news, I have been practicing my juggling skills over this weekend, and I'm quite impressed with myself. I can juggle 3 clubs for about 2 minutes, and the same with 3 rings (about the size of... *gets ruler out* 20 cm across). I can do 3 small balls for significantly longer. It's great fun, I would recomend anyone take it up as a hobbey... wait! Is juggling a hobbey...? If it is.. wooooo! yay! I have a hobbey! It's not is it...? No. Oh well, I still need a proper hobbey, but juggling! What fun. I generally listen to my music on the computer and try to juggle in time to it, which can get tricky, especially with the fast 'element song' or 'nations of the world'. anyway, my most recent attempt it to juggle 3 balls whilst spinning around on my computer chair, which is fairly hard, but you soon get used to it, if you go slowly at first. So everyone, go and start juggling! So much fun. And I'm the only person (other than my 2 sisters, whom I TAUGHT) who can juggle 3 balls properly. It's a great feeling knowing that. Anyway, that's what I've been doing this weekend, other than revising, homework, eating and sleeping. (If you leave out the comma between homework and eating, it looks like 'homework eating', which is probably not the best idea) 'Opf, David, whyyy are you eating the homework I set you, yeh? We reallyyyy haven't got time for this'.  Anything else to say? Can't really think of anything. Oh well, bye for now.

      Evenin' all. Davey C is back in da house. Innit. Bad. Wick...ed? Meh, it's probably not important.  Today's blog will actually have some reason/bestimmung for being written, which certainly makes a change from those random pictures and 'I did revision etc' blogs. Today I shall blog about a very special event that occured on Tuesday, and continuing onto Thursday. An event so important, that it had been planned for days before. An event that was so crucial, that failure was not an option. An event that was  Operation Commie Nazi.  First of all, here is the plan, in Matrix style, of course. NB, the people in this plan are my and my friends nations on that website Nationstates (link on side). I'm Pisylvania, Valmar is dickybod,  Polok is megatrobe, Cax is nonnesuch, and Commie Sausage is Deutsches D. The rest are other friends. Enjoy :)  Pisylvania: There's a classroom. Inside this classroom there's a poster which no person appreciates, and which few people like. This poster is filled with pictures. These pictures show many things, holy things, but one picture is special. One pictures shows the Commi Nazi. This school is protected by a very loud fire alarm. Every setting off triggers the evacuation. Salian: evacuation? Did he say evacuation? Pisylvania: But like all alarms it has a weakness. The alarm is placed in the school. Strict teachers guard the alarms. Valmar: Jakubovic. Pisylvania: If one person is caught, so must the other be. Cax: Someone gets caught at the alarm, no poster. Red Islands: But you'd have to make several pupils talk to distract a teacher like that. Pisylvania: Not several, 27. Salian: 27 pupils? Pisylvania: There is a person. He must be the distraction. Cax: Jako must have some kind of failsafe. Pisylvania: Yes, he does not get easily distracted. Someone must wear trainers in the school. This must be the distraction. Flinndoglo: Then what do you need us for? Valmar and Polok could take the poster and do the alarm easier than we could. Pisylvania: There's no time. Cax: Why? Pisylvania: Once the alarm is activated, the bells will be ring. But the school will be evacuated immediately. Red Islands: How long will that take? Pisylvania: Exactly 314 seconds. Flinndoglo: Just over 5 minutes. Pisylvania: That is the length and breadth of the window. Only The One can steal the poster, and only during that window can the poster be taken. Cax: How do you know all this? Pisylvania: I know because I must know. The poster's my purpose. It's the reason I'm here. Same reason we're all here.  Necronz: Valmar, I know something will go wrong. You don't have to tell me. I just want you to know that I'm here.  Pisylvania: Both must be done as one.  Jermasoy: Trainers can't hurt.  Pisylvania: If one fails, both fail.  Valmar: At breaktime, there's an absense of teachers in the classroom. At breaktime, we will strike.  Mr Guy: Hey! You drink coffee at home. Mr Herbert: Why, I get paid to drink it ‘ere.  Perundia: Okay, break's started. Protonese: How much time? Perundia: 12 minutes. Protonese: Oh swud!  Valmar: All of this year we have worshipped this poster. Today I believe we can take it. That poster was not an accident. There are no accidents. It was not drawn by chance. I do not believe in chance when I see 1 objective, 1 distraction, 1 poster. I do not see coincidence, I see providence, I see purpose. I believe the poster brought us here. The poster has power. I believe this poster holds for each and every one of us the very meaning of Commi Nazis.  Commi Sausages: I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how. Necronz: I promise you, if I can, I will. Commi Sausages: What if I asked you to stay out of this, no matter what. To stay out of the classroom? Necronz: Why? Commi Sausages: Please. Necronz: All right.  Valmar: What is it, Cax? Cax: I can't help it, Valmar, I can't help thinking - what if you're wrong. What if all this - the poster, everything - is bullswud. Valmar: Then tomorrow we may all have detentions, but how would that be different from any other day? This is a school, and we are pupils. Detention can come for us at any time, in any place.  Protonese: Jakubovic!. Incoming! Incoming!  Valmar: Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the Commi Nazi is a God? What if tomorrow the God could be ours. Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth getting a det for?  Flinndoglo: Time?  Salian: 3 minutes. Blood and Water: Almost there.  Pisylvania: It is time.  Necronz: Find the others. Jermasoy: Got Cax right there, they're already in the Concourse. Necronz: What about Flinndoglo? Jermasoy: There, they're still inside, but... Necronz: They're in Jako's classroom.  Valmar: That's it, let's go.  Necronz: Call Commi Sausages now. Jermasoy: Lost them. They're inside the classroom block. Necronz: What about the fire alarm? Jermasoy: Everything's still operational. Fire alarm hasn't been set off. Jesus. As soon as they take that poster, it's all over. Necronz: The hell it is. Jermasoy: What are you... Necronz? Necronz: I will not stand here and do nothing. I will not wait here to watch them get a detention. Jermasoy: Necronz, we're talking less then 5 minutes here. Necronz: In 5 minutes, I'll set that whole goddamn alarm off.  Commi Sausages: How much further? Pisylvania: Here, just here. Jakubovic: I'm sorry, this is out of bounds.  Jermasoy: It's gotta be the ugliest rule I have ever broken. That's as close as I can get ya. You better run very fast. Jermasoy: Operator. Necronz: I'm in. Jermasoy: Keep moving, fire control system.  Jakubovic: I am surprised to see you here, Commie Sausages, that's the difference between us. I've been looking for you. Commi Sausages: What do you want, Jako? Jakubovic: Oh you haven't figured that out? Still breaking all the rules except the ones that don't matter. I want exactly what you don't want. I want you to get a det. Valmar: Would that include even during an evacuation? Jakubovic: Go ahead, set off the alarm. The best thing about me - I never forget faces.  Computer Room Technician: Christ, what happened in here? Computer Room Guard: Hold it right there, little lady.  Jakubovic: If you can't get one now, get one later. Commi Sausages: Valmar!  Jermasoy: Still no sight of them. I don't know what they're doing, but they only got 2 minutes left.  Jermasoy: One minute! Necronz: Come on. Come on. Please.  Jakubovics: Book them.  Jermasoy: They took the poster. I don't believe it.  Pisylvania: It was meant to be. Valmar. That door will take you to the playground. [to Commi Sausages] You'll know which door. Hurry, Commi Sausages.  Ok, so we weren't really going to set off the alarms. But we were going to steal the poster. Here is what actually happened:  Tuesday  Break time  - 10:30 Me and Dickybod meet outside whilst having something to eat. We finalise the operation plans. 10:43 - We make our way to our English room. 10:45 - We enter classroom building and head for english room. 10:45:30 - Dickybod stands at door, being a very good look-out, whilst I take a chair, stand on it and take the poster off the wall, along with the blue-tak. 10:46:30 - The poster has been put in my bag, Dickybod comes into the classroom. 10:46:50 - The first person enters the classroom, and notices nothing.  15:50 - The poster is taken out of my bag and straightened out.  15:50:30 - PC turned on. 15:53 - Picture placed in scanner, scanning proceeds. 16:00 - Scanning and saving finished. Later that night - Sent copy to Dickybod.   Thursday  07:30 - Poster folded and put into school bag. 10:30 - Me and Dickybod meet outside to discuss conclusion of operation. 10:43 - We make our way to English room. 10:45 - We enter classroom building and head for english room. 10:45:30 - Dickybod stands at door, being a very good look-out, whilst I take a chair, stand on it and put the poster back on the wall, with the Blue-tak.   OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.  If you want a copy of the poster, contact me on MSN for details.  Did some practice biology and chemistry tests earlier today.

      Following dickybod's lead, I have decided to post some random pictures. This one is of my good friend megatrobe (center) and another friend, Rob (left). I don't know who the guy on the right is. Btw, this photo was aparently taken quite a few years ago.  Firstly, the original picture:     And my entry for our caption contest:     I thought that was fairly funny.   Anywho, haven't been up to much recently, had to learn about 300 German words, kind of did that, and scribbled my english homework down in about 10 minutes. Haven't done as much revision as I probably should have done, but meh. Started reading 'Interesting Times' by Terry Pratchett. Seems fairly good, I'm about 150 pages in. Discworld books are generally very good, I reccomend them to all. This is it if you are interested:     Cover looks quite nice....  Oh, watched Sleepy Hollow last night, 'twas an ok film, not great. About some headless horseman ghost killing people around a small village in the 18th Century. (I won't bother to put a picture for that). I haven't really got much else to say, so ta ta all.

      Ow, my sunburnt neck hurts. The skin feels really sore. Oh well, next time I'll know better and put suncream on.  I haven't been doing much today, other than reading. It's just gone 1500 and I'm up to chapter 14 of Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix. I may just finish before  urlLink dickybod . I hope so... Although I haven't been reading all day. I went to Sainsburys this morning, and I've been on the computer for a while. I'll aim for about chapter 18 or so by the end of today, which will be nearly half way. If I can then finish the rest of it tomorrow, I may be in with a chance.   And that's really all I've been doing today.  Bye for now.

      Greetings, my excellent readers!  urlLink Thorpe Park  happened today. Funnily enough, I woke up at just gone five in the morning, and as I couldn't get back to sleep, read a couple of chapters of Harry Potter, before getting up at 0630. I met Steve at me local station and got a tram to East Croydon, where I met the others. And then to Staines, for a fun and thrilling day. (Notice the alliteration there). Samurai was proably the best ride, which we went on about 5 times. And not only is it a greta ride, but they play the Burly Brawl music in the background too. Sooooo cool. Anyway, Collosus was also good, as was Vortex, Nemesis, Detonator and Tidle Wave, which we got soaked on. And I stayed wet for most of the day, after standing in the big wave at the end several times. Had Burger King For Lunch, which was nice.  Oh, and for some reason I got REALLY sunburnt. I mean REALLY sunburnt. My face is pink and the back of my neck is damn painful. There is a very distinct line where my shirt collar started. :) It will be painful tomorrow... :( It wasn't even that hot and sunny. It was cloudy for some of the day. Damn skin type 1...  Also, after listening to the Burly Brawl music 5 times, we had decided (me,  urlLink nonnesuch , rob and  urlLink megatrobe ) that we may attempt to learn some of it, just as it would look so cool. Or not. But it would be fun, and that's what counts. :) We obviously can't do the high kicks, or the trows, but we could put other stuff in. It truly is an excellent fight scene. One of the best I've seen in fact.   urlLink Dickybod  is now reading the Harry Potter series, in an attempt to beat me to the end, even with me nearly having a 4 book head start. He finised the first 2 today. I'm buggered. How embaressing...  And yes, I am very much enjoying my summer. I expect great times ahead.   Ta ta for now   Weather:  Sunny, though I thought it was cloudy :(  Reading:  Harry Potter 4  Listening to:  Burly Brawl Music  Watching:  Burly Brawl in background  Confused about:  sunburn  Annoyed with:  sunburn  Mood:   In a bit o' pain

      The time has come. It is done. I have waited for this moment for five years. Five years... My God, that time went by terribly fast. But now I am free. Free for 9 weeks. The feeling is in-describable. I have a whole summer with nothing planned. I can do anything I want. Well, within reason. If you hadn't guessed already, my exams are over. Probably should have mentioned that earlier. :) Thorpe Park tomorrow, 'twill be fun. And then on Friday I must return to school to hand in text books, but that doesn't really count as school. Or not work anyway.  Well, business wasn't actually too bad, I thought it would be much worse. I managed to finish with a few minute to spare, and got some good points down for every question.  Now I'm free, I haven't actually got a lot to do, which was the main subject of my last post, and I won't bore you by repeating it all again. I'll have to start putting more time into my Esperanto learning, as  urlLink Nonnesuch  has started learning it, and I'd rather he didn't beat me at it. After all, I started it. That happened in my little pi learning competition though. I started learning, then Rob joint in, overtook me and nicked my 50p. :( So I must learn Esperanto good and proper, and remain the superior one.  And finally, I missed my goal. I didn't finish the Harry Potter books by today. Oh well, I tried. I'll aim to have them finished in a few weeks, and keep my pace nice and slow.  I haven't really got a hell of a lot to say, so I'll leave it there for now.  Cherio all.

      Chess is a great game. I had another go on my electronic chess game, and won, after losing only 3 pawns, 2 rooks and a queen, after leaving the computer with only a king and pawns. Not that you wanted to hear  all  the details :) I had better increase the level next time I play, so as to keep me on my toes. I strongly reccomend all to take up the game, it is very satisfying.  So, what else have I been up to today? Not much really (again). Actually, I did put all my books from two years of GCSEs into a cardboard box, now on the floor in my room. It doesn't fit under my bed :( Time for some re-arranging me thinks. I've also beenr eading a fair bit o' Harry Potter, and I'm slowly getting through it. Pity, I had aimed to finish all five books by tomorrow afternoon, but meh. Then I aimed to finish the fourth by tomorrow. But meh. I'll settle for half way through number four, which I have achieved.   Now, what haven't I done? Firstly, I haven't watched tv for a few days, being stuck with only five channels. 'Television's a waste of time, we don't need  more  channels.' my mum will say at least once a week. So I stopped asking a while ago. I also haven't built a trebuchet yet, but I hope to do that later into the summer.  urlLink Nonnesuch  and  urlLink Megatrobe ? I think we seriously would be able to. How hard would it be? *jinx* And I haven't become nocturnal yet, but I'm not sure if I will though, for reasons stated earlier today.  AND  morse code, I've been meaning to learn that too at some point. I learnt it last summer, but forgot it through lack of use. I was only able to use it for about 3 days or so, before it trickled down out of my brain. (NB, that's one of those metamorphorical thingys that Mr 'Oh Boyyyys' Herbert went on about - basically a lie) I'd better learn it properly this year, and try to use it every day. Maybe I can post a few blogs in it, but that would make them difficult to read, so I'd better not.  AND  I have been maening to go ut with friends more, to stop me getting bored around the house. Hopefully that will start soon. Duds? I'm getting bored in here. Well, Thorpe Park on Tuesday will be good.  Business Studies. The exam will be beginning in about 18 hours. Damn again to those guys who have already finsihed theirs. I haven't revised for it, but funnily enough, I don't regret it yet. My guess is that in 19 hours and 15 minutes I will regret it, just as I leave the exam. But then, when that moment comes, there won't be anything I can do to change it, so there will be no need worrying. Problem solved! And then I will be free. Free for 10 weeks (or there abouts). Even though I've been free this weekend, it will be more genuine in 20 hours from now.  That will be all for now.  Toodles all.   Weather:  Heavy rain 30 minutes ago.

      It is time for another blog, which can mean only one thing. Yep, I'm bored. I shall start by saying that my sister's friend/boyfriend came to stay with us yesterday and this morning, whom she met in that rain-soaked city of Bristol. He seemed quite friendly, but I didn't see much of him as they went out yesterday evening, and left this morning for a trek round London, after which he will be going back home, to wherever he lives. I did find out that he did some sort of engineering course at university (he finished a few years ago), which sounded quite interesting, and he is now involved in some sort of flood engineering thing. Apparently raising the Thames flood barrier, although protecting London, causes other areas of the conutry to flood. Anywho, I still think civil or structural engineering would be an interesting thing to do.  I've also been trying to fill my time with learning how to count in hexadecimal, which although looks difficult isn't actually too bad when you get the hand of it. You just need to add a few extra digits when you get to 9. Ie: 27, 28, 29, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 30, 31 etc. Very easy when you know how. Learning how to multiply in hex though, now that will be challenging. Doing this and learning Esperanto really makes you think what a hard time kids must have, needing to learn all this stuff. (Well, deciaml counting and English. Not Esperanto, obviously). I think my Esperanto is comming along nicely though, all I need is to learn some more vocabulary, and I reckon I'll be able to speak it as good as I spoke German after about a year. La malgranda knabo vidis la grandan instruiston (I think) means, 'the small boy saw the big teacher.' Yes, you can see I need to develop my vocabulary, but the language structure and grammer is there.  I'm also reading more now, and I'm definatly more than half way in Harry Potter 4. A rather good book. Oh yes, I must learn to cook during this summer, as well as learning how to pick locks, and basic escapology. These may all come in useful one day. I must go out with friends more too, as I was stuck in the house all last summer with nothing more than a computer and books to keep me occupied, and it got very depressing afte a while. Duds, we must organise some dud outings. Maybe a dud-a-thon. And what else.... ah, I've been thinking about inverting my sleep pattern, for no reason other than to check an extra box on a geek test. (I don't think it was on the one on the sidebar, another one somewhere). I will definatly have to wait until after tomorrow (my last exam) and away from any holidays my family want to take. I don't think we have anything planned yet. But going to bed at 10 in the morning and waking up at 8 at night would be weird. And depressing, as I would not have much time to talk to people, at home or on MSN. Meh, there would always be the neopets chat boards. And I also played a game of chess against an electronic chess board yesterday, which I beat fairly easily, although it was on level 1 out of 6. I think I beat level 3 once, ages ago. But it was very fun, and can keep you occupied for ages. And better than playing against a person because it makes a move almost immediately after you move, so there is no waiting whilst the opponent thinks what to do. Although it does make very stupid mistakes, and will sacrifice any of its pieces without question just to get one of yours. Maybe I can change the settings somehow...  Anywho, Business exam tomorrow, which I haven't revised for in the slightest, but meh. Thorpe Park on Tuesday will be good.  And finally... For no apparent reason, Windows Media Player has deleted all the playlists, and the ENTIRE MEDIA LIBRARY I had set up for it. I still have the music in a folder on the computer, but it has all been taken out of WMP memory. So all the playcounts have gone back to zero. :( And I'm the only person who ever uses the computer... Strangeness...  Bye for now.

      I've just realised how bored I am going to be during this summer. Although I have a business exam on Monday, I don't really plan to revise for it (which I mentioned yesterday), so I have started my summer activities a little early. After only one evening, I have done what I had planed to do, and that was tidy. For the past 2 years, I have been doing homework and revision in our front room downstairs, which the computer is in aswell. This room proved a good place to work, as most tv watching is done in pur back room, and my house in generally quiet anyway. Well, after 2 years, the room was rather untidy, with sheets, exercise books, text books and computer equiptment scattered across the place. My mum gave me slack, my excuse being that this was how I liked to work. Now the exams are pretty much over, I had no excuse, so had to do a bit o' tidying. So, for 2 hours last night, whilst listening to 'good stuff' playlist on WMP, I gathered all my books from 2 years, all the sheets, and all the text books, and ordered them. I took all the sheets out the back of the exercise books, and stacked them all nicely. Now they are in piles on the table, waiting to be put into a box which will be put under my bed, next to another box that contains books from my junior and infant school. I don't like throwing things away. :)  Well, the room now looks pretty good, and when I went to do something else, it struck me. What else actually is there to do? Err... I do have a list written down somewhere, I could look at that. Stuff on there generally needs help from my friends, such as build a zeplin, and a trebuchet. I'll learn Esperanto more, that's actually quite fun, but I want to use the computer as little as possible, mainly because it's unhealthy. I could go out with friends, but oooh. Tough. I last went out with friends at least 3 months ago, possibly more. Yep, I am that lonely. Well, I'm going to Thorpe Park on Tuesday, and that will be good. I'm going with  urlLink nonnesuch ,  urlLink megatrobe , steve and rob. Got fairly cheap tickets too, £18. But that's still a lot. Just cheaper than the normal price.  So, what else have I been doing? Oh yes, I've taken to listening to foreign radio stations, just for the fun of it. I've been listening to  urlLink KQED  mainly, (it's from California) but also something from Germany, from  urlLink here . The newsreaders speak quite slowly and clearly, so it's not actually that hard to understand. I can pick out the odd word, but I don't know why I bother, as I was trying to forget the language. Well, I'm sad, I know. :)  That's about all for now, cherio all.

      1 exam left. Just 1. BUSINESS! You cannot possibly immagine how mad that makes me. Of all the exams that would be last, it had to be the hardest one. With lots of writing. And after many of my friends have finished. And after a weekend. And in the afternoon, meaning I have a morning of worry. All bad circumstances, but together... HELL. This weekend  will  be bad. Well, it won't be that bad, I suppose. I'll probably be feeling sorry for myself, with the impending doom of what is now known as a business exam. I doubt I'll do any revision for it. I hate the subject, and if I got a C or a B, would it be  that  bad? I'm not doing it next year, and don't plan to do any business/english related course at university. That is if I go to university. I haven't really decided yet. And plus I kind of revised for the other two exams we had, and they didn't go too badly. Well, I nearly threw up in the first one, but we'll say no more about that. :) And even if I did revise, I doubt it would improve my grade  that  much. There's just so much to learn, so I won't bother. :) Yes, lots of reasons why not to revise.  Looking at my MSN list, out of the 7 people online, 4 have football related names, no doubt due to the game that was played last night, between England and Portugal, I think. I didn't watch it (who do you think I am?) but as I was going to sleep, I heard the radio presenters comment on the penalties that were being done as I lay in my bed, trying to go to sleep. I must have fallen asleep just before the game ended, because I din't find out untill the radio switched back on at 0630 this morning who had won. It turns out Portugal won, if you didn't already know. So, what was I doing during the football? I was actually watching a rather ammusing film on channel 5, with Robin Williams in. Called 'Father's Day', if I remeber correctly. 'Twas rather good.  I may as well write a bit about what I've been doing today. Statistics...  foundation  was first, which was incredibly easy, and lasted 2 hours. I finished in 50 minutes, and by 1 hour, all had been checked numerous times. So, what did I do in the remaining 60 minutes of the exam? I recited the Architect speech from Matrix Reloaded in my head, twice, then started it in pig latin, but it got rather confusing, so I stopped. Let's see... what else... Oh yes, I how many bricks tall the wall of the hall was, untill it got to the wooden layer of the wall. It turns out the wall was 54 bricks high. Oh, and I tried to memorise the square root of 2, now what was it...? 1.414213652? I'll check... 1.414213562. Oh well, nearly remembered it. Ah, and then I recite the first 15 minutes of the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Radio series (that's about as far as I could remember) That took me to about 5 minutes to the end of the exam. And as the second hand crawled round the clock, the exam finished exactly on time. 2 hours... wow. But the fun wasn't over! Oh no, next I had a physics extension exam. Lucky me! It wasn't too bad, and I think I did fairly well on both exams today. In exactly 3 days, I will be in that business exam, with 45 minutes of exams left.  Lastly, I would like to say 'damn you' to the following people, for finishing their exams:  urlLink megatrobe ,  urlLink stompp ,  urlLink astrojaxx ,  urlLink moolb , matt, steve, dave rangel, dave cooper, and lots of others.

      Another day, another blog. Well, I have a free day today. Of course, some of those fools have the next few months free, but then, I will get more GCSEs then them. Hopefully. Well, not  urlLink megatrobe . I will get the same ammount, but with a later exam. Damn business...  Well, I didn't really do much after last night's blog. I didn't bother revisng, but did a bit o' reading. Slowly getting through Harry Potter... I did a bit of physics this morning, for the extension tomorrow. Most of it looks quite easy, whereas most of chemistry looked impossible. I'm not too sure about wave interference, and amplitude and frequency modulation, but that's about all. I'll look over it again later. We don't have to learn the circuit stuff, do we?  And then will be statistics, which will be very easy, as was said yesterday. I'll have a quick look over that later too, just to make sure I get a C grade. A grade D would be very embarrasing.  I also took some more quizzes just now, not having much to do with my time. Here be the results:    -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly.

      So, I had more time to waste on the internet, so I took a few more quizzes. Here are the results, if you are at all interested.    Ki-lin  A mythical being of Chinese mythology, comparable with the western unicorn. Ki-lin personifies all that is good, pure, and peaceful. It lives in paradise and only visits the world at the birth of a wise philosopher.  The Ki-Lin is said to walk on earth and on water. It never drinks or eats dirty food or water. The Chinese unicorn never treads on smaller animals below its feet nor does it ever harm another living creature. The Ki-Lin is the emblem for exquisite goodness, longevity, grandeur, endless compassion and great wisdom. According to Chinese mythology, at the birth of Confucius a Ki-Lin appeared and Confucius died soon after a Ki-Lin was killed, he believed that his writings would not proceed from the omen of the death of the Unicorn.    urlLink   Which Chinese Mythological  Being  Are You?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla            My inner child is ten years old!

You are slightly arrogant and vain but you probably deserve to be.  You are confident in your abilities and know what you want to achieve in life.  Similar to vampires you will use almost any means to get what you want.

      And then there were 3 exams left. Only 3. Damn those fools who have already finished (Stompp, Astrojaxx and Dave Rangel so far whom I know of). The chemistry was... very difficult. Extremely difficult. But just about do-able, I suppose. There were one or two quesitons I knew, but some were just impossible, like 'what type of barium salt should be used as some sort of medicine, based on these facts'. I DON'T KNOW!!! But it's over now. After the 45 minutes of the chemistry extension, it was finally over. Until September, when I will start all again, (with maths, physics and computing) after foolishly chosing to do chemistry next year. Yes, it can be interesting, the main reason I chose it, but it is extremely difficult. Well, it'll make me look clever I suppose, unlike say... drama, media, film and english. (just THROW your life away,  urlLink dickybod ...)  So, I now have a free afternoon and all day tomorrow off before my next exams, which happen to be statistics and physics extension. Stats will be piss-easy, as I am doing the... Oh..?  FOUNDATION ! (immagine Nick and Matt saying this, it gets very annoying after a while), so the most I can get is a C grade. But I may as well do it, as it's an extra GCSE, and needs barely any revision. No, really, it doesn't. The questions go along the lines of 'Fill in this pictogram by looking at this graph' and 'Work out the mean, median and mode of these few numbers' Not exactly challenging. But I will do a bit of revsion for it, as if I got a D or something lower, I would look like a right idiot. I need to have a look over frequency density, and a few other things.  Then will be physics, which will probably be harder than the bio extension, but not as bad as chemistry. A lot of the stuff looks quite basic, like analogue and digital signals, resonance, momentum, and SUVAT equations. I best do a bit o' revsion for that tomorrow. I'll have a free afternoon and evening today. :)  Ok, more news about this heap of junk that pretends to be a computing machine. The story so far... The internet freezes.  I was advised to defragment. Defrag doesn't work, tells me to run scan disk. Run scan disk, and tells me to close programs, even though all are closed.  Think for a while. Informed by  urlLink nonnesuch  to ctrl+alt+del and close some from there. I do so. Scan Disk and defragment work. Internet doesn't freeze. All fixed? Turn on next day (this morning), it's back to freezing. Think for a few moments. It must have been the closing of programs that stopped the freezing. Close all programs but explorer. Fixed again.  And here I am.  Does anyone have any suggestions about this? If not, I may convince my parents that our computer is broken again, and not properly fixed.  That's about all for now, again.

      Another 2-post day. I have some rather good news though, which I thought was worth blogging about. My computer is kind-of fixed. Well, the links on the internet don't stick anymore, which makes browsing the web that more more pleasurable, and makes you realise how much you take things for granted. At least a month it was like that, but seems better now. And why? I hear you asking. Ok, obviously I don't actually hear you, but I immagine you would be asking. All it took was a little something called 'disk defragment'. I've no idea what it actually does, other than make the computer work better (post in comments if you know, I would like to know), but it seemed to do the trick. It didn't work when I tried it before, and kept saying 'run scan-disk to check for drive errors'. Doing that, I was told I had too many applications open for scan dick to run, and I should try closing some. Even though they were all closed. Then today I found out I should try ctrl+alt+del and close some from there. Doing that, I left about 5 open, and ran scan disk and defragmentor, which combined took pretty much since 14:00 to now, about 19:00. About 5 hours. Wow, my computer  is  slow. But that bad news about it now working is that the chances of my mum buying a new computer become pretty much zero. I can immagine conversation:  'You want a new computer? You said you fixed the one we have now...'  'Yes, but ours is nearing 5 years old' 'Does it still work?' 'Well, yes, but...' 'If it still works, what's wrong with it?' 'It's very slow' 'So? I won't but a new computer if the one we have now works ok.' *Then comes the real reason I want a computer*  'But our one won't run the newest games' 'So you want me to spend about £500 so that you can play games? It's unhealthy to sit there all day playing on that computer...'  I would never win, unless the computer actually blows up, and you can see the pieces of it scattered about the room. So, looks like I'll be stuck with this old thing for a while. I'll get a new one if/when I go to university.  As the defragmenting thing was running, I filled the time by watching the second half of Matrix Revolutions, and Star Wars VI, both excellent films. I also listend to some of my favourite music, whilst juggling. It reallt aches your arms after a while...  Ta ta for now.

      The physics test wasn't too bad, which is good because it should make up for the abysmal grade I'll get in the physics extension on Friday. I think I knew the answer to just about every question, and if not I gave a good guess. Come on A*... I got an A* in the mocks in December, so if I get very lucky... Well, chemistry tomorrow. The extension. That will be far from fun. I've barely even looked at the chemistry section in the additional sciences revision guide, so I best do plenty of that this afternoon and tonight. Of course I say that and I probably won't do much, but oh well. I'll do a little. Who wants to do that when I could be doing something much more fun like... like... errr learning Esperanto! Of course, that's much more fun! Right? Well, I think it's fun. A bit. I tried a bit last night, and I think I have a vocabulary of about 20 words, which is fairly good for one night, I think. So, I have learnt a few basic sentences, such as: Patro trinkas teon - Father drinks tea. Patro trinkis teon - Father drank tea. Patro trinkos teon - Father will drink tea. It's a nice easy language to learn, so hopefully by the end of the summer, I will have progressed quite a bit. If you're interested,  urlLink this site  is where I've been learning it from. I think you're supposed to have some sort of teacher helping you on it, but I haven't bothered with any of that. Anyway, yes, I know I  should  be revising, but that's boring.  Well, as I said, chemistry is tomorrow so I best go and revise for it soon.  That's about all for now. Bye for now.   Weather:  Nice day, sunny, a few clouds.

      Additional Maths and Business case study. Additional maths was actually quite hard, worse than I was expecting. I don't think I'll get 66% like I did on the mock one a few weeks ago. But hopefully I'll get some sort of grade, whether it be an E or a D. Either of those would be good. A C would be great, and I won'g get a B or an A. Then came a very boring 2 and a half hours, in which me and nonnesuch sat in the hall, talking, reading the paper, and doing minimal business revision. A while later, we wandered to the library, and I read 'The Empty Grave' a terrible horror story I finished in about 10 minutes, including looking at the pictures. :) The story was terrible. The business exam was quite easy, mainly about a sole trader, which is about the most basic thing in business. And it only lasted an hour, but I had a little time to check it, unlike maths where I barely started the last question. But still, only 5 exams left. Physics tomorrow morning, chemistry extension wednesday afternoon, physics extension and statistics foundation on friday, and the last business on monday. One week today. In one week, I will be all finished. I will make a point of blogging at this time next week, to let off some of my excitement. Remind me, won't you, if you see me on MSN in exactly one week. Poor  urlLink dickybod , who has a media exam on wednesday week, 2 days after my last exam. I'll try not to taunt him too much on MSN Monday evening... well, maybe a little... :)  In other news, today be the longest day of the year. Which isn't particually exciting. Not at all exciting. In fact, not really different from any other day, so boring as hell. We get a few minutes more daylight than yesterday, and a few minutes less (if that) than tomorrow. What fun. Apparently loads of people gathered at stone henge this morning to see the sun rise on the equinox. Can't think why... Anyway, here's a random picture of stone henge. Looks quite nice, I think.

      Afternoon all. Groan, Maths and Business exams tomorrow. I'm not feeling too bad about maths though, I've revised as much as I can (well, not really, but I think I understand it all) so I should be ok. But business... case study... and I haven't really revised for it. I'll probably do a little during the break between the 2 exams tomorrow. I say that now of course, but when the time comes, I never actually do. But then it's only business, and if I got a B at the end of it all, I would be perfectly happy. I may be slightly dissapointed with a C, but not overly. I'd get over it in about 20 seconds. So that's why business revision hasn't been high on my agenda. Or on my agenda at all. Actually, to be perfectly honest with you, I don't even have an agenda. I just revise when I feel like it, and whatever subject I can be bothered to do. So it only takes up about an hour per day, and that's only light revision. Anyway, I always blog about exams and stuff, so I really need a change of subject.  Earlier today, I re-discovered an old computer game 'Red Alert', which I haven't played for ages. It's not actually too bad, although Red Alert 2 is much better. Shame I don't have 'Generals' though, as that looks rather good. But it would probably make my computer have a heart attack (or something technically simmilar) if the CD was even put it. Well, at least that would finish it off, instead of it just frequently fainting, having memory loss, and tiredness (it does things slowly, it  must  be tired). I think I may look up those symtoms on the internet, and see what the problem is. One mo'....  Ok, my computer has...  urlLink Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  :s Hmmm... let's see... 'The first treatment most doctors recommend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced diet' I could let my computer rest for a while, but I really would get extremely bored if I did that. Exercise? I can't really see how I could do that... use it more than I usually do. Maybe I could set it to do some large multiplications on the calculator. It often says 'this operation may take a while' when continuously pressing 'cube answer'. And a balanced diet... hmmm, I suppose I could just open programs I haven't opened for ages, or put in a variety of CDs - music, games and DVDs... Poor computer. If only euthanasia were legal...  In other news, I finished 'Harry Potter 3' this morning, finally. A rather good book. Now to start the next book. I wonder if I can finish it in just one week.  Well, not much else to say.  Bye bye for now.   Weather:  Hailing?!?! And rain. (Well, it' stopped now) Overcast most of day  Reading:  In between Harry Potter 3 and 4.  Listening to:  Starngely, nothing....  Watching:  The Paroll Officer last night. Great film.  Confused about:  Why I chose business studies  Annoyed with:  My computer  Mood:  Alright.

      After finding I had more time to waste on the internet, I decided to do a few more quizzes, here are the results.    My liege!    urlLink   What Monty Python Character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Power Rangers Movie!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Don't get blood splatters on you when you shoot your victim.

I went to PC World in Croydon with my oldest sister and parents, in order to by her a lap-top computer for when she starts university in September. I had to go, as I'm the one who knows the most about computers in my family, (You didn't expect that did you?) and I was needed to give advice to my parents on what to buy. We eventually settled for the cheapest one they had, but still about £650 or so. This probably limits  my  chances of getting a new computer now, as my mum isn't likely to want to buy 2 computers in one summer. I may get lucky though, if we find a cheap one.  And 3 posts in one day. Wow, I should be revising more. Oh well, did a bit of maths revision, and got through all my exercise books, and understand pretty much all of it. I'm sure I'll get at least a D or a C. Best do physics tomorrow. I doubt I'll bother doing much business revision.

      Good morn to my fellow bloggers! I haven't been doing much lately, but I felt I may as well blog all the same.  Well, the younger of my older sisters came back home from Bristol University for the summer, which is nice. Although she's going back in September, but at the same time, the other of my sisters is also going too University, in Birmingham, so it looks like I'll be an only child after this summer... Just me and my parents. Wow, that will be fun. Sisters are always useful for buying you stuff, and giving you lifts places, and they never hit you like brothers do.  So what else is there to say...? I've been doing a bit of maths revision earlier this morning, and a bit yesterday; it doesn't look so hard. As long as I do more revision later today and tomorrow, it should be a fairly easy exam, with only one or two quesitons I can't do, usually the 'prove this equation is true or not' question, that I can never do. Most of the other quesitons should be straightforward though. Groan... I've got a business exam on Monday too, in the afternoon after maths. The case study exam! Dun dun duuuuun. Well, at least it's not as bad as the last paper, which will be on the Monday after next, the 28th. That WILL be terrible. And after the maths,  urlLink Megatrobe  will get to go home, and I will have to stay at school with  urlLink nonnesuch . Oh well, it could be worse *jinx* *looks at exam timetable to see a further 10 business exams taking place through the summer* *It's worse*. Aaaaaaanyway. I probably should revise for the business exam, but I doubt I will, until Monday, during the 3 hour gap between the exams. Although, this paper was instead of coursework, and I do think that the exam is better than coursework. Well, it's quicker anyway.  7 EXAMS TO GO! WOOO! Damn  urlLink Dickybod , who has only 4.   Weather:  sunny, bright, a few clouds  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban - read quite a bit more this morning  Listening to:  Some Matrix quotes - The Architect speech at the moment  Watching:  Malcom in the Middle yesterday, rather good.  Confused about:  Areas under graphs  Annoyed with:  Business studies  Mood:  Satisfied

      Being on study leave and all (study? Ha!), I have had the oppertunity to watch a bit of day-time tv, which I must say... is terrible. But that then makes me think of most tv programmes now, which are also pretty bad. I have now realised that there is no programme series that I watch regularly, such as every week/day. I have no tv commitments any more, since The Simpsons was taken off BBC2, and Friends finished on C4. But then, I suppose this is a good thing,a s tv really is a waste of time.  Firstly, I shall see what is on BBC1 this morning (BBC1 being the most watched channel, probably). 0930 - To Buy Or Not To Buy 1000 - Bargain Hunt 1100 - Trading Up 1145 - Cash In The Attic  Can you believe that? 4 auction-type shows in a row! Tv really has gone downhill... I wonder if anyone actually does make a point of watching these programmes. They seriously can't be interesting. And there are so few programmes with proper actors in them anymore, especially on BBC1. All we get now are documentaries and reality shows, with the occasional soap. Which reminds me - Soaps are terrible! I can't think why so many people watch them. The story lines generally go along this line. Person A is boyfriend/husband of Person Z. Person B also likes Person Z. Person Z likes Person B more than Person A. Person Z's best friend, Person Y secretly tells Person A that Person Z doesn't like him, but Person B. Person A goes on a mad rampage, killing Person B. Person Z is now distraught, and blames Person Y for the tragedy. Person A and Person Z are now in a bad marriage/relationship. Person Y leaves town, blaming herself, and is assumed dead from an exploding car. Ten years later, (after a failed music career) Person Y comes back, to find Person A and Z have had a child, but have split up. Person Y then falls in love with Person A. Person Z is distraught, and kills herself. Etc etc etc. Wow, I could write a soap opera. They're not so hard. These are generally the terrible story-lines that are on at least 10 times a week from a number of different soaps. And then a few years later, the story is repeated but with Person C, Person D (person A's grown up, criminal Son) Person W and Person X.  And then there is reality tv shows, which I have blogged about before. Cruel ecperiments on peopls such as sleep deprivation, or just being watched and tricked for weeks on end. And people volanteer (sp?) for these? For a few weeks of fame. How foolish some people are. And then a few weeks after the series is finished, one of the 'house-mates' is spotted going into a laundarette, and a double page article is written about it in a magazine. (I actually saw this in a magazine in my house, about one known as 'Jade') Why would people want to know where others do their washing?  And then Childrens tv, which is also much more terrible than my day. Did you ever see that Basil Brush Show? *shudders* That was almost unbearable. And Teletubbies? WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?!?!?! Giant... things... who eat custard and toast and can't even speak. Kids programmes should be educational. Blue Peter has also gone downhill too. Only a few months ago I saw some terrible band (might have been 'busted' or 'mcfly', or one of those types. Maybe 'blazing squad'. Yes, probably them) performing their 'modern' music to the youth of today. This is terrible, I blame this music for many of the troubles in todays youth. Bands like these are caught taking drugs in night clubs, beating bar tenders up, or carrying knives or guns around with them for 'protection'. They should be setting an example to youth! And then youth copy them, and we have the gun crime on the increase, more and more people taking drugs... what was it I heard... 1/4 of 15 year olds have tried drugs or something like that. It was very shocking, whatever the statistic was.   And then adverts on during kids tv. Advertising McDonalds or CocaCola, corrupting the youth of today. And then you get all this 'healthy Mcdonalds salad' and 'Ribena (sp?) toothkind, as approved by the British Dental Assosiation. I sense some corruption here. 'Of course, next time I  would  prefer the inconspicous brief-case to the sack with a dollar sign on it...' Young children, watching their pathetic programmes see these adverts, and watch the kids in them enjoing what is obviously a drink or meal that does more harm than a bag of sugar, and worry their parents for them. These parents, who cannot take the screaming any more, give in, and the child eats and eats, getting larger and larger, until we become like America. And don't even get me started on America, I would be here all day. Maybe another time, as revision is calling me.  Wow, that was a long rant, much of which I have blogged about before, but it feels good to 'let go of all that hatred and anger and your journey towards the dark side will be complete'  I best do some maths revision, additional maths being quite challenging. May do a bit o' business too, as the first exam didn't too well; (See the blog before this to find out why). Or a bit o' physics, I haven't done anything for that yet, and I have the first exam on Tuesday, with maths and business on Monday.  Bye for now.   Weather:  Overcast, looks like rain is comming  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban. Yes, still. I won't finish them all in time now.  Listening to:  A weird version of the Element Song  Watching:  Guess. Yes, go on, you'll never guess.  Nothing . Nothing at all. Not even an electronic sausage.  Confused about:  Long division, with polynomials (I think that's what they are called)  Annoyed with:  Quite a lot. You should know, after reading all that.  Mood:  Grumpy.

      I write now having completed my first business exam, which I must say was probably the worst one I have had so far, for several reasons.  1) I was feeling terribly ill this morning (don't worry folks, I feel quite a bit better now). I had a bit of a headache over breakfast, but nothing too bad, so didn't think anything more of it. Got a lift to school, feeling a bit worse when I got there. I was called into the exam, sat down, headache now getting quite bad. I decided to grin and bear it (ok, I didn't grin, I wouldn't want one of the teachers to think there was something wrong with me, but I did try to bear it) I was ok for the first 2 questions or so, but then something deadful happened... I came over all hot... heavy breathing... headache getting worse... felt like vommiting... stomache contracted... and nothing came out. Luckily. Sat there for a few minutes trying to recover, and went back to answering the question. Still feeling fairly bad, but not quite as much as before, I did about half of the paper. And then it happened again...came over all hot... heavy breathing... well, you know the story. I was seriously thinking of leaving the exam, but I didn't. After about another 4 minutes, I seemed to recover a bit, and went back to answering the exam. But I was writing awfully slowly, and my hand was shaking slightly. Didn't even get on to answering the last question (which turned out to be a 12 mark one) and I did about half of the penultimate one.  2)It was also the worst exam so far, because there was so much of it. 12 mark, 9 mark. 12, 12, 12, 9, 4, 12, 12, 9 etc. And that went on for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Although, I didn't find any question particually difficult, knowing at least a few points for each.   Anyway, as soon as I got out of the exam room into the open air, I felt almost perfectly fine, with only a slight nagging headache. Waited about half an hour with my friends  urlLink Deutsches  and someone called Nick, whilst we waited for another person named Tom, who had extra time for some reason. Then we proceeded to walk home.  I also had a biology extension exam yesterday, which I was going to blog about after it had finished, but I didn't get round to it. Thinking it was going to be dangerously hard, after seeing stuff about genetic fingerprinting, ribosomes and messenger and transfer RNA in the revision guide, I was actually a bit worried, having not learnt that hard stuff, but it turned out to be quite easy, the only question I had no idea of being 'Name 2 scientists involved in developing vacines'. I named Dalton and Harvery, but after a quick Encarta check at home, turned out to be wrong. Dalton was an atomic physist and Harvey discovered blood circulaiton. The correct answer should have been Jenner and Flemming. Oh well, it was only 2 marks.  Getting home today after business, I had a bit to eat (crisps and water to drink) and watched Star Wars Episode V video, which I must say is a great film, but not as good as VI or II. After that, feeling more hungry, I had an abysmal attempt at cooking a fried egg on toast, which I thought would be easy. It wasn't. It looked more like scrambled egg with flattened into a pulp. Also nearly ruined the frying pan too. The toast wasn't done properly either, as I toasted the bread straight from the freezer, not wanting to cut the fresh bread, or wait for this one to thaw out. Therefore I decided to have a peanut butter sandwhich instead :)    Weather Very cloudy, quite warm. Partly sunny earlier.  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban. I'm not going to achieve my target, am I?

      I'm scared... I have my first of threee business exams in about 42 hours. Business is easily the subject of exams which I am dreading/ have dreaded the most. All that writing... and so little time to write it in... and the 15 mark questions... and the boiling weather outside... and when I have the last one  urlLink megatrobe  will already be on summer break. And I WILL BE IN BUSINESS! :( :( :( I think that deserves at least three unhappy faces.  Anywho, closer to the moment, I have a biology extension exam tomorrow, at 0830. That will be tough. I have kind of revised it, there are three chapters (that number has cropped up three times (four now) in my post already... strange... a conspiracy maybe?) that are in the revision guide that need learning, and I have spent most of the morning going over them, trying desperately to remember the difference between phyagcytes and lymphocytes. Fortunately, I now remember what they both are. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf and digest antigens, and lymphocytes are white blood cells that produce anti-bodies to deal with the antigens. And then of course there are two types of lymphocytes, B and T types, each of which do different jobs. (At this point,  urlLink Dickybod  and  urlLink Deutsches  should be VERY grateful they don't need to know this stuff. But then I am doing tripple science, and will of course get that extra grade at the end of it all... *smirks*)  Business! ARGHHHHH!  urlLink Deutsches   and  urlLink Nonnesuch   and  urlLink Wendy  will all feel my pain though, as they too had to sit through three hours per week of the horror that was business studies (there's that number again). Still, only three (and again) and a half hours of the subject left... ever. Well, for me and Nonnesuch. I'm not sure about the other two. So far, I've spent about 10 minutes revising business, which I'm sure is no-where near enough... but it's the most boring of boring subjects there are. Example. How could Mr  urlLink Boring   improve his profitabilty so that he could make his firm even more boring than it is? (10 marks) *glance at clock - 2 minutes to do it in* And there will be three (again...) exmas of that. The horror, the horror...   I have probably put the most links in this post than I have in any other. Meh, felt it was worth mentioning.  Well, best be off, no need moaning about it, that won't do anything. But then, I am a moaner after all. :)   Weather Some cloud, fairly hot. Glad I wasn't in that maths exam earlier...

      And then there were 9 exams left. 11 1/4 hours. Not long now. In exactly 2 weeks, all exams will be over, with no school work for about 9 weeks. That summer will be good. Just immagine... so much time, so little to do...  Back to the real world, I had chemistry and english today. Chemistry was fairly good, with not too many hard questions, lasting an hour and a half. A nice long break, with another walk in the woods followed. And then a sit in the hall, whilst we pretended to do english revision, but actually talked about... well, whatever we normally talk about.  urlLink Nationstates  for one thing. Did a few drawings in the anthology too.   English was easier than I expected. First was comparing 'Half-Caste' to 'Unrelated Incidents', amazingly dull, but not too difficult. Then, ' describe  a shopping centre at night and  describe  a shopping centre during the day. A nice and easy question to finish off all english exams. Just think, I will  NEVER  have to do an english exam ever again.  EVER ....nice...  Oh, and then a rather unexpected happening happened about half way through the exam.... a mobile phone rang.    Horror of horrors! Well, I heard after that the... person whose the portable communication device belonged to was one 'Robert Turner'. Apparently he could be disqualified from every exam. Well, to him I can say only one thing. And that is: Waaaaaaaaa! You must be pretty stupid to take a phone into an exam, even when we are warned every before each exam by some ugly woman with a voice crossed between a crow and a dying cat. 'NO MOBILE PHONES ARE ALLOWED IN THIS ROOM. EVEN IF THEY ARE SWITCHED OFF! AGAIN, NOT MY RULING, THE BOARD'S RULING' What a fool that Robert Turner must be. Hehehe      Weather Clear, warm.

      Afternoon to you all. I blog now for the one reason... I am rather bored. Chemistry revison is very dull. I  do  need to revise more at some point. I did a practice test earlier this morning, and got a middle B, which isn't that bad, but it isn't really very good either. But those practice ones are rather hard. And they don't give you any slack in the mark scheme. In the actual exams, there is a little 'accept this..' section for the anweres, making them slightly easier. Anyway, bio wasn't too bad, so this shouldn't be too hard either. I'll probably do another test later today and another tomorrow. Or maybe two tomorrow. I need to get them both done though.  Now I come to think of it, what else have I actually done today. Revision and... oh yes, reading Harry Potter. Still 40 pages left to read today. So I haven't had a very interesting day. Doesn't time fly when you're having fun? Still, chemistry and English to look forward to on Monday. That will be comparing poems from other cultures, which aren't too difficult, but terribly boring. We have notes in the anthology though.  I have also added to my signature thing. Well, why not?  Well, best be off, bye for now.

      Monrnin' all. Dickybod told me to do another blog, so here it is. Shazaam!  Firstly, I am just about on schedule for my Harry Potter readin task, which if you didn't know was to read the 5 books in 19 days, before the last exam. I worked out it came to rougly 115 pages every day, which I may just about manage. In the 2 days gone, I have read the 220 pages of the first book, so I seem to be going well. I'll need to read the first 125 pages of the second book later today to get it all read on time.  In other news, I had English and Geography exams yesterday. I was one of the few who thought the english one was fairly challenging, but I hope I managed to at least get a B. After that, many went home, but several, including myself, megatrobe and nonnesuch had to stay for the geography in the afternoon. We spent a little time revising, first outside, then in the hall, not that you really wanted to know that. Revision then started getting dull, so we turned to discussing random stuff, and then decided to take another walk in the woods behind the astro-turf. We came out the other side and walked back to school along the road.  Geography wasn't too bad, I thought it would be harder, but I seemed to do ok. A grade A would be very nice, after all, most of it's just common sense.  That evening I spent a lot of time reading Harry Potter, yes, I know I should have been revising, but meh. Oh, and I have made quite a change to my life aswell. Wait for it.... I ate chicken for dinner, 'twas in a nice sauce thing. It actually didn't taste too bad. (At this point I should probably mention that I haven't eaten any meat but fish for about 3 years.) I don't really know why I didn't eat meat, just out of habbit really. Anyway, I've decided to slowly introduce meat back into my diet, as it is probably good for you, and I was never really bothered about the animals anyway. I still don't think I like beef or lamb though...  And then came this morning, when I walked to the last ever German exam. It turned out to be surprisingly easy, most of it just multiple choice. But no more German.... EVER. That is a very good feeling. Oh, no more geography either, but that wasn't as bad as German. All that vocab learning.... *shudder* So, I walked home after the 50 minute exam, turned on the computer, and here I am. And that's everything that has happened between the last blog and now.  Today, I will probably watch Jurassic Park III, which I taped from Wednesday, I didn't see much point staying up past 23:00 with an exam the next day. I'll also do that reading, and maybe some chemistry and bio extension revision.  That's all for now, bye all.   Reading:  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, soon  Listening to:  Matrix Architect Speech. Yep, you all know I am sad...  Watching:  Jurassic Park III later  Confused about:  Why I gave up meat in the first place  Annoyed with:  Steinbeck, from English exam  Mood:  Good.

      I haven't posted here for a while for several reasons, and I only post now because: 1) I am very very bored and 2) Dickybod keeps telling me to do so, and I always do what he says :) Well, a lot of the time anyway.  So, the reasons why I haven't posted. These would mainly include the computer trouble I am having at the moment. I shall describe the problem. Internet Explorer is buggered up. Every time I change page, it crashes/freezes for about a minute or so, possibly more. (If you have any possible solutions, then leave a comment or email me, this desperately needs fixing, although it may be an excuse for a new computer...) As you can immagine this gets rather annoying after a while, as it takes about half an hour to go to about 3 web sites. So I decided to stop using it as much as I had done. In fact, I have only been using the computer for no more than 30 minutes every day, which is probably for the best, as I do kind of have exams at the moment. Well, not right now, obviously, as I would not be blogging if I did. We don't use computers in exams (not even in the computer exam) And even if we did, I would not waste my time blogging, I would be doing the questions, unless it was a piss-easy exam like the IT one we had a while ago, when it lasted and hour and a half and we all finished within 45 minutes. I'll shut up now...  Ok, the second reason why I haven't been blogging much. I felt that I should do revision. After all, I do have both English AND geography tomorrow. What a chiz, two exams on the same day... But we had two on Monday, and it wasn't too bad. The First one was geography decision making, for which I had already prepared an answer to the last question for, and the questions weren't too bad. Example: What is the populaiton of Shrewsbury? *looks through resource book given to us* Ah, it was XXXX I can't actually remember the answer, but I'm fairly sure it was correct. :)  When that was over, me and my good friends decided to do a bit of revision for the impending doom of biology later that day. After about half an hour of sitting in the sun in the junior playground, we decided to go and eat some food, as break time was nearing, and the playground would soon be swarming with small children, whome for some reason I despise. The lary bastards... I'll get 'em one day... Ok, then after break, not wanting to do any more revision, we decided to go for a walk in the woods, situated behind the astro-turf thing. It was quite a nice walk, during which we saw plenty of interesting items. Old bath tubs, fridges, and the odd tree or two. Walking round for about 20 minutes, we headed back, as we discussed the possible outcome of a fight between Hogwarts teachers (from the Harry Potter books, if you didn't know) and the Jedi Council (You really should know that they are from Star Wars). We didn't really come to a conclusion, I was thinking Jedi would win, as they can see events before they happen, but then what if a wizard dissaperated? Or 'Accio lightsabre, transfigue to useless stick'? Then of course a jedi master could do force lightning. Or use the force to summon a wand and snap it. Yes, me and my friends are this geeky. We discussed the possibilities for quite a while. Back in the school hall, we did a bit more revison, and just talked for a while until lunch time, when we ate, then went to the biology exam. It wasn't too bad, but it would have been better if my nose hadn't been dripping through the whole thing, and I only had two tissues. And the heat wasn't swealtering. But it didn't go too badly.  Ok, another reason why I haven't been blogging. Yes dickybod, I will keep the reasons comming. I have been reading :) Yep, reading is great fun, much more fun than revising anyway. I can get at least 75 pages done every day. I finished  urlLink 'Guards, Guards'  only this morning, which I must reccomend to all. Excellent book, rather funny too. And now I have decided to read the Harry Potter books again, as I haven't read one for about a year. Or whenever book 5 came out. I'm already at about chapter 6 or so. I'll aim to have all 5 read by... by the end of the exmas. Yes, just under 3 weeks. A nice challenge for me. Yes, I should be revising, but that's rather dull.  That should do with reasons for not blogging for now. If you want more dickybod, you're not getting them.  So, what have I been doing today. Well, as I said, I have been reading those 2 books. Guards, Guards and Harry Potter 1, if you have forgotten already. I have also made noted on nearly all the case studys that may come up in tomorrow's exam, and sort of learnt them in the process. I hope. And I have been blogging. That is about all.  *Looks back at length of post* Wow, I wrote quite a lot this time; saved up all that news for my dear readers. Well, I best get back to geography revision, ta ta.   Reading:  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  Listening to:  Combine Harvester - The Wurzles  Watching:  Jurassic Park III tonight. Or maybe video it, it's on rather late. Well, 21:00, but it finishes late, and I have exams tomorrow.  Confused about:  The Aswan High Dam  Annoyed with:  Englih Exams  Mood:  Fairly good, surprisingly.

      'Tis definately time I did another blog.  Well, a little has happened since the last time I posted. Firstly, I had my 16th birthday a few days ago, which was rather good. And that now makes me older than Dickybod, but not megatrobe, deutsches or nonnesuch. I recieved a few DVDs, namely the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which are fantastic films, as well as Matrix 1 and 3, also excellent films. I already had Matrix 2. I shall take this opertunity to say that Revolutions is worth seeing if only for the final Neo vs Smith fight scene - perfectly done. Also got a new radio alarm clock for my bedroom, as the last one kept going out of tune for no apparent reason. Oh, and I mustn't forget the last present. 'Twas a set of pencils from WH Smiths. I needed some more pencils...  I have also been to see 'The Day After Tomorrow' at the cinema, which was on Tuesday, which I think was a pretty good film. Had some good mass people dying scenes, as well as New York getting totally buggered. That was probably the main reason I went to see it. To see New York destroyed. Definately worth it. Finally, I saw 'Harry Potter 3' earlier today, which was... fairly good. About what I was expecting. It's been a while since I've read the book, so I can't really compare it. I don't think they left anything too major out... generally a good film.  And I have been doing some revision. Mainly biology and geography, as they are what I have on Monday. Did a few practice bio tests, which I did ok on, not great though. I should probably revise it more.   Reading:  Guards Guards  Listening to:  Burly Brawl  Watching:  The Day After Tomorrow, Harry Potter 3, Distraction and Have I got news for you tonight.   Confused about:  Biology, maybe  Annoyed with:  My computer, it's buggering up again.  Mood:  Ok.

      A rather good day today I think; me, megatrobe, nonesuch, deutsches and Steve went on a trip to London. I decided to go to Beckenham Junction to get the ticket, as there’s never a man in the ticket booth at Clock House, and I don’t like buying tickets from machines (They always steal your money, or are broken). I walked to Clock House from there. I was supposed to meet Steve here, but we foolishly managed to miss each other, so ended up getting different trains to the same place. Apparently he waited for me, whilst I got on the first train :) I met Megatrobe on the train, and together we took a trip up to Charring Cross, where we waited for the others. We were all there within half an hour. Not very good timing then…  First we decided to go to the British Museum, which is supposedly very interesting, but being teenagers, we had no appreciation for fine artefacts from ancient times. So we left after about 20 minutes. At least it was free to get in though. Next we walked for a little and decided to go for a walk along the South Bank of the Thames, to see if we could get further than we did last Thursday. So, crossing Tower Bridge, we walked along the riverside, whilst fantasising about us owning a similar ship to the HMS Belfast that we saw along the way. We only got to London Bridge when we all got hungry, and decided to find some place where we could find some products for consuming. We found a pleasant area with a glass roof over with cafes nearby, and ate our food which we purchased in the London Bridge Station shop. Only £2.99 for a sandwich (I had a baguette/roll thing), a packet of crisps (McCoy’s), a chocolate bar (Twix) and a drink (Lilt). Pretty good value methinks.   We then continued walking along the south bank until we got to the Tate Modern art gallery, where we looked at a wide variety of… ‘art’. Rubbish, weird mirrors, plain coloured pictures, strange films and random models of cars and balls in glass tanks. The best was a giant spider though :) Spent about an hour in there, but we soon got aching legs, and took a walk over the millennium bridge, (which used to wobble) and straight to St Paul’s Cathedral. We didn’t stop there, but walked on ‘til we found a station, Blackfriers. Here nonnesuch left us, and the rest of us took a tube to Embankment and the walked to Charring Cross, where we got a train back to Hayes. (Me and Steve got off at Clock House). We then walked the rest of the way home.  Overall, I spent 7 hours 50 minutes out of the house (yes, I timed it :)  ), and was a very good day, if not tiring. Didn’t do much when I got home.  Bye for now.

      Good evening my fair readers.  Today was a better day than most; a trip to a friend’s house was taken (by the name of rob), where we played several good games.   Getting up at about 08:00 I was in perfect time. I had a shower, ate some serial (Shreddies this morning), and talked to  urlLink Megatrobe  on MSN for a bit. I looked up the way to Rob’s house, and reckoned it would take me about 40 minutes to get there on foot, so at 09:20 I set off. I arrived at 10:03, so my estimate was pretty good.  urlLink Megatrobe  and  urlLink Deutsches  were already there. Needing only to wait for Steve, Rob and me started a game of chess. Steve then arrived and we all started a game of Star Wars Episode II Monopoly. That took a while, and was even quite frustrating when I didn’t actually land on any properties for at least 15 moves. By the time I started getting lucky, most were bought, and so I think I ended up only buying one straight from the board (as well as a Station, (or star ship in this version)). I had to trade and buy the rest from others for ridiculous prices. I never collected a whole set :( But I wasn’t first out.  urlLink Megatrobe  was out first, then Steve. Then me, and after a bit more playing, Rob and  Dave  declared a draw. During the final moments of the game, I played Connect 4 with .  Megatrobe . And I lost. :(   Anyway, during the game of Monopoly we stopped for lunch in the garden, whilst watching the dog try to make out with an old rag. Or at least that’s what Rob reckoned he was doing :) Lunch was pretty good, Sausage rolls, steak pies and crisps. I wasn’t so keen on the pie, so I fed the last bits of mine to the dog :)  After Monopoly we played on the Gamecube. Everyone else had one at their own home, so were obviously much better than me. But I soon got the hang of it. I never was much good at computer games though. So, after this we watched a bit of ‘The Office’, a rather good comedy series, and me and Rob continued our chess game. And I won! But only because I promoted a pawn to a Queen, which I had previously lost to the enemy queen, which was immediately taken. Although Rob wasn’t keen on this promoting rule, but that’s how I always play. This no doubt won me that game. I wouldn’t have stood a chance otherwise.  Then some more Gamecube was in order, on which I slowly improved, but still no match for the others. And then finally we had a game of Trivial Pursuit, Genus Edition. (Not Genius Edition, as I earlier read it). We didn’t quite finish it, as  urlLink Dave  needed to go home about half way through, and soon after me and the others left, but not before Steve won.   Steve gave me a lift home, and I arrived at about 18:50, 9 and a half hours after I left this morning. Not being too hungry, I only had a raw carrot, an apple, a banana and a slice of toast for dinner. Then I turned the computer on, and started blogging.  What a good day. :) We may go to London on Saturday, although this is not for certain yet. Possibly go to the British Museum.  Bye for now.   Weather:  Sunny, hot.

      Evening all.   Not a great deal’s been happening since the last blog, not really anything worth blogging about anyway. But I feel a blog is in order nonetheless.   So, in the past 2 evenings I’ve done a bit more cooking, which I’m quite proud of. Yesterday I made some good ol’ macaroni cheese, which tasted pretty nice, although the sauce was a bit thick. Too much flour methinks. And then tonight I cooked a vegetable casserole thingy. I was going to do a Shepard’s Pie, but only remembered the mince after putting the vegetables in, and then it was a bit late. So I had chopped vegetables in water with an oxo cube and mashed potato on top, baked in the oven. Pretty good, but too much water.  Mostly today I’ve been playing on the computer, err... that’s about it. Also had a game of chess. And did a bit of reading in the morning, although no more than about 20 pages.  Well, tomorrow should be a better day; I’m going round a friend’s house to have a game of monopoly. Great game.  And finally, I’ve discovered some information about the final Star Wars film to be released, ‘Star Wars Episode III – Revenge of the Sith’. And a description of the film:  “After three long years of relentless fighting, the Clone Wars are nearly at an end. The Jedi Council dispatches Obi-Wan Kenobi to bring General Grievous, the deadly leader of the Separatist droid army, to justice. Meanwhile, back on Coruscant, Chancellor Palpatine has grown in power. His sweeping political changes transform the war-weary Republic into the mighty Galactic Empire. To his closest ally, Anakin Skywalker, he reveals the true nature of power and the promised secrets of the Force in an attempt to lure him to the dark side.”  Sounds good doesn’t it?  Well, that’s all for now, Ta ta.

      So,  urlLink Megatrobe  has his own website. Meh, who needs that? Well, it would be nice, but I’m not going to spend £27 per year on one. I doubt I’d ever use it anyway. This blogger site will do for me for the present.   So, news from Dave. Firstly, with my oldest sister Caron buggering off to Majorca for a holiday with some of her friends, and my parents going off somewhere for a few days, and my other sister working at Buckingham Palace (only selling tickets, nothing exciting) I get most of the day home alone. W00t! But I doubt it will be any different from any other days.   Well, yesterday was slightly different, in that I cooked for me and Tracy cauliflower cheese, a recipe for which I found on the Internet. Now, even though this is a great technological age, I don’t have a digital camera, so no pictures will be appearing on the blog, unlike  urlLink dickybod , who got pics of his cooking. You’ll just have to trust me; it turned out very nice. :)   So, what else, what else…? I’ve been trying to make today more productive than normal, and so I spent a while longer learning Esperanto (an incredibly sad thing to do), and I’m progressing quite well with it. If I’m very lucky by the end of Summer I should be able to speak it pretty well.  And finally, I watched 'Aliens', which I videoed from last night (twas on a bit late for me). A rather good film methinks.

      There seems to have been a recent lack of posting on my blog recently, mainly because I haven't really been doing anything worth blogging about. Since Thursday (the London trip) I have been mainly dividing up my time with using the computer ( urlLink Neopets  chat boards, browsing the  urlLink Nationstates  fora and reading articles on  urlLink Everything2 , which is actually quite interesting), sleeping, playing chess, and reading. Well, it's not all for nothing, as I managed to finish The Fellowship of the Ring this morning, which was quite an achievement. Only 2 weeks after I started it, so in pretty good time. Could have been faster though.  Yeserday I watched 'Return of the King' DVD, even though I've watched it at least three times before. A good film though; it kills over three hours of the day too.  And that's about all of my daily happenings. And I have 6 more weeks untill school starts again. Now, don't get me wrong, I love my summer holidays, and would much rather be at home than be at school, although... well, school does make something to do. And I am slightly looking forward to sixth form. It should be quite good (remind me to read this again when I start and see if I thought correct), only the 4 subjects that I actually enjoy... no essay writing... (hopefully) becomming a prefect... I think I'll enjoy next year more than any other year at school. Wow... it seems such a short time ago I was leaving my old school, finishing year 6 (Best not say what school it was; internet safety and stuff) and starting my current school. That was 5 years ago. My God, time really does fly. *At this point he remembers his old form and idiot-of-a-form tutor, and those once weekly lessons in the library.* Those were the days... the only thing to worry about being if you did your homework neatly (or at all, if you're  urlLink dickybod ) And now 5 years later I've done my GCSEs and ready for sixth form. Anywho, enough reminiscing, back to the boring life of your friend dave.  So, recent films I have watched. Firstly, '10 Things I Hate About You', which was on last night. 'Twas ok, but still just a classic American high school romance comedy type. And also, this afternoon I watched 'Thunderbirds Are Go', from the 1960s, which wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but alright.  I'll probably arrange another sort of outing with the duds to keep myself occupied in the comming days. Maybe the cinema. Or something else.

      So, The Dickyblog has 101 posts. This is my 96th, so in a few days I shall be reaching that special time. A time for celebration. A time for rejoicing. But most importantly, a time for blogging, as I will have written my 100th post.   Oh, Dave, we reeeealy haven't got time for you to be blogging now, yeh? I mean, we have sixth form starting in just 6 weeks and we still have a ton of work to get through now. I reeeealy need you to engage with this... believe me yeh?  Aaaanyway. More about that when the time comes. If it comes. Who knows? We could wake up dead tomorrow....  Right, there has been a recent lack of posts in the past few days, mainly because I haven't been doing much other than alternating between the computer, reading, and sad stuff (ie chess, morse code, writing with left hand etc). And that is not really worth blogging about. But today was different. Oh yes, very different. For today I went out with friends!!! (that deserves at least 3 exclamation marks) The last time this happened was... July 7th, on that memorable trip to the science and natural history museums in London.   Well, today a trip to London had also been planned, with me, megatrobe, deutsches and rob having a wander. So, here is a detailed account of how the day went. Enjoy! We all met on a train from Hayes to Charring Cross; of which I got on at Clock House, after getting a tram from Beckenham Junction. The train was delayed by 10 minutes, so there was no need to panic when the tram was just sitting in Beckenham junction doing nothing before it left.  Arriving at Charring Cross at preciesly 10:22, we made our way out of the station, across the road to Trafalgar Square, where we got photos of Thunderbird 3, as well as ones of us climbing the lion statues. Next we took a walk to St Stephens Tower (which houses Big Ben) and walked past parliament en route to a small area of greenery by the Thames. A significantly longer walk took us to Buckingham Palace, which had hundreds of people crowded outside, trying to get a glimpse of the changing of the guards, with loads of police around, some with heaftry machine guns it looked like.   Next a walk to Hyde Park Corner, narrowly avoiding an angry cyclist on the way; we saw Marble Arch, then got a tube to Canary Warf, as Dave knew a good place to eat near there, and we were all getting hungry (except jon for some reason...) Anywho, tube to canary warf, and Docklands Light Rail to some place nearby to go for a short walk to a nice Chinease restaurant. All you can eat for £5.90, plus a glass of water making it up to £6.90. And I ATE DUCK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. Not too bad actually. Plus lots of other stuff.   Realising how far it was to Canary Warf, we walked back there, passing some novelty sized apple sculptures made from grass and computer cables. Some more photos. Next was a tube to Oxford Street, where in Virgin Megastores I desired to purchase the Two Towers soundtrack for £5.99, very good value. Also had a go on the keyboards, as well as Spiderman 2 for PS2. [At this point The Dave stops blogging to have some dinner] We then went into Cost Coffee in Virgin for a drink and rest from walking all day.  Leaving Virgin, we saw Tottenham Court Road tube station across the road, meaning we needn't have walked nearly all the way down Oxford Street from Bnd Street Station. Here we got another tube to Tower Hill (not direct) so we could catch a glimpse at the Tower of London as well as Tower Bridge, which we walked across.   And then it was suggested by me that a walk along the south bank of the river to Charring Cross would be a good idea, where we could then go home, but after getting only about 1/4 of the way, decided to go to London Bridge instead, much nearer, as we were all very tired. Here we just missed a train home, but got another 10 minutes later.  A 15 minute walk home from Clock House and I was home at last, 8 hours 45 minutes after I left. (09:15 - 18:00) A quick shower was in order, and then a blog. And here I am.   A generally fun day, which I feel we must do more often. I need to get out the house more after all.  In other news, I started reading 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' last night, which seems to be fairly good. All about grammer and how many people don't know how to use it. Probably qite useful too.  That shall be all for now.  Ta ta all.    Weather:  Sunny, cloudy, warm. A spot of rain on the way home. Now overcast.

      Not a particually interesting day again,, however I  did  manage to get out of the house, for the first time since Friday. And the fun filled event of my leaving my dwelling? A trip to the dentist. Not the most exciting of experiences, I can say. I went in, I sat down, someone looked in my mouth, and then I left 5 minutes later. Well that was a waste of time.  &nbsp;  I also finished watching most of the special features from the 3 Lord of the Rings DVDs. Some were actually quite interesting. But yes, another waste of time.  &nbsp;  And that is my day so far, other than a bit o' interent browsing.  &nbsp;  Fun fun fun. :) Later I plan to learn some more Esperanto, and practice writing with my left hand. If I get very bored... And then there's Lord of the Rings to read, which I would have wanted to get finished by 31st July (when they are due back at the library) I'll never make it, but I'll try to get the first two books done.  &nbsp;  Bye for now.  &nbsp;   Weather:  Cloudy, clear earlier.

      These past few weeks, I think I've realised what both and incredibly difficult and incredibly easy life children must have.  &nbsp; First, a difficult life: I have recently been learning many... different things, just for fun and to use up some of my spare time; mainly Esperanto, Hexadecimal arithmatic, and writing with my left hand. All are very challenging to get the hang of, especially writing with my left hand. (I'm right handed). It really exhausts you, and seems to take all your energy, trying just to write about 10 lines. Learning to write for the first time must be hell. It aches your hand so much! Ok, now for Esperanto. If you don't know, this is a language, made for the pupose of being international, and very easy to learn. Despite this, there is still one heck of a vocabulary to learn, as well as figuring out word order and what-not. And this is meant to be an easy language. Something like English must be terrible to learn. Although I don't remember it being that hard... Children have to learn a whole difficult language fluently in just a few years! And now for Hexadecimal arithmatic. This is, a different number system to the decimal one we are used to. Instead of 10 digits (0-9) there are 16 digits (0-F). Although I've just got the hang of counting up and down, addition and multiplication will be very challenging. Learning how to do this at school must be terrible. I now feel some pity for those young fools who still can't do simple addition. Even though they are at school, kids still have so much to learn; which they MUST learn, or face being labeled a retarded cretin. I'm mighty glad all I'm doing is voluntary. &nbsp; Ok, now for the easy life. 'Ignorance is bliss.' [as said by Cypher - The Matrix, 1999]. Being 16, I live in a world where I have the knowledge that instructions to make nuclear weapons are posted on the internet, asteroids could hit the planet at any second, wiping out all that we know, and that life can only get worse.  &nbsp; Which brings me onto my second point of the day, a&nbsp;response to  urlLink megatrobe.blogspot.com 's last post about hope, and that everyone needs hope to be happy. I shall try to make an argument against it, but most likely fail miserably. (You can feel the cynicism already, yes?) Throughout history mankind has been living in a world of false hope, living on dreams, which rarely come true. Although people can be happy with their false hopes, they really should just face the real and miserable truth: things can only get worse. Take the 1950s for example. Our parents and grandparents were told of a life of luxury in they year 2000, where robots would do all our work, and space holidays on the moon would be common place. And what have we now got? Unemployment through automated jobs, an overweight nation through lack of manual labour, and exploding space shuttles [my condolences to families of those on Columbia shuttle]. And what are we now promised? People walking on Mars, 'smart' houses with sensors and voice activated what-not, and cars that will drive themselves where you want to go. This will no doubt lead to more unemployment, more laziness, and more unforeseen disasters. 'Things can only get better'??? Bah, humbug! &nbsp; In other news, I watched 'Never Been Kissed' last night, a truly terrible film about a reporter going undercover in a high school in America, despite having bad experiences there as a child. (Think Richard Hann crossed with Paul Leonard torments) If you don't know these people, which is more than likely, then just the lowest of low people in the school, who even the geeks and nerds reject. :) And this un-amusing story is mixed in with some love story with one of her teachers. Not a particually good film. &nbsp; That shall be all for today. Bye for now. &nbsp;  Weather:  Overcast mainly  Reading:  The Fellowship of the Ring (They've just got out of Moria)  Listening to:  Good Stuff  Watching:  Never Been Kissed  Confused about:  MSN not working  Annoyed with:  Computers  Mood:  Fine

      The&nbsp;story so&nbsp;far. In beginning&nbsp;I made a blog. This has made a lot of people very angry and is widely regarded as a bad move.  [based on the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams]  This blog originally featured the daily/weekly rantings or a disgruntled teen, who disliked pretty much everything that isn't how it was in the good ol' days. After a few weeks, I ran out of things to moan about; even grumpys like me have some limit to our unhappiness at the world. So with the rantings out the way, the blog slowly started to chronical the daily happenings of dave, which mainly mentioned revision, homework, and generally being bored. The blog supressed this boredom a little, but not enough. With homework finishing and revision started, my boredom level rose significantly; revision? Pah! Who needs that? Well, I do, and no doubt on August 26th I will figure that I should have revised more. And then the exams started. And then they finished. The Summer started. A whole 10 weeks of nothingness to look foreward to. And here I am. This story will continue, until March 14th, 2062, when I will meet my timely end, most likely due to suicide (according to a quiz from a while ago).  &nbsp;  Waffle out the way, I best write something of more interest or I will lose my good readers. I shall write the happenings of today. I got up, I read the Fellowship of the Ring, I went on the internet, I read some more, I went on the computer more, I read some more, I played chess (and won), internet, reading etc etc. I need a life. And I watched some special features from Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers DVD. Which were ok, if you have nothing better to do.  &nbsp;  And I just remembered - last night I watched 'Alien' for the first time, which I recorded from the day before. Started off a bit slowly, but soon picked up, with plenty of blood, and aliens bursting out of stomaches. Lovely. :)  &nbsp;  Anyway, back to The Fellowship of the Ring. I'm up to chapter III of book 2 - The Ring Goes South. The Fellowship has just left Rivendell. The book started off rather slwoly, but it's now very good. All should read. Especially&nbsp; urlLink Megatrobe,  who now seems to read a lot. READ IT!!!  &nbsp;  I think that will be all my blogging for today.  Bye for now.  &nbsp;   Weather:  Heavy rain earlier, now cloudy   Reading:  The Fellowship of the Ring   Listening to:  Film Themes Playlist   Watching:  Alien   Confused about:  Nowt (I must find more things to be confused about)   Annoyed with:  Boredom   Mood:  Fine

      Wow... Like others, I have noticed the new... twiddly things you can twiddle with on new posts.&nbsp;  Excellent!&nbsp;    Ok, I promise not to do too much fiddling with them.               &nbsp;  So, as you may have guessed, I have returned from that fun place called 'Dorset'. More specifically,&nbsp;'Poole' It's quite a nice town, but fairly dull. Nicht viel zu tun, ja? Sorry, I promised I would forget that dreadful language ASAP didn't I? So, what happenings did Dave get up to during his visit? Well, I had a game of putting with me dad, who won :( By 11 hits over 18 holes. Meh, I'll improve if I keep at it. And I had several games of chess (so about what I would be doing here in London then), but this time the old fashioned way, you know, where you actually  have  to play with someone else.&nbsp; Firstly, against my mum, who should have beat me, but managed a stale mate when trying to get 4 queens. Fool. Then with my oldest sister, whom I beat, which I felt very proud of, naturally. Slaughtered about 4 pieces with a queen right at the beginning of the game.  &nbsp;  Ok, what else... what else... Well, we took a day trip to some town called 'Swanage', a rather nice town by the sea. Got some fish and chips for lunch, and walked round the shops. But then, horrow of horror! My sunglasses broke! :( So I threw them away. Although, this is not totally bad news; I can now buy a pair of Smith glasses, if I find a good pair for fairly cheap. If not, then just a normal pair would sufice.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, enough about the holiday, I am now back in good ol' London. Horrah! Yes, well, I went to see 'Spider-man 2' earlier today, which I must say is a truly excellent film. Although I think I liked the first one better. Or maybe just the loud people talking were annoying and ruined the film. Damn kids... I'll get 'em one day.... So, I reccomend it to all. Even if there weren't enough explosions.  &nbsp;  And now I have about 6 weeks left untill I start the wonderful time of 6th form. With only 4 subjects, and tons more work, All that to look forward to. Well, could be worse, I could be doing something like drama, media film and english next year. Oh, wait... I believe&nbsp;dickybod  is . Fool. Just    THROW    your life away... (knew that new fomatting thing would come in useful at some time. :)  &nbsp;  Anywho, I need to arrange more outings for the dud-a-thon, as this will be a long summer.  &nbsp;  Bye for now all.  &nbsp;   Weather:  Cloudy, sunny   Reading:  Fellowship of the Ring   Listening to:  Brave Sir Robin   Watching:  Spider-man 2   Confused about:  Nowt really   Annoyed with:  Loud people in cinemas   Mood:  Good

      Generally uneventful past few days. The most interesting this being that I had a hair cut this morning, for £9, which is the normal price. And of course, I played on the computer, did a bit o' reading, and played a game of level 2 chess yesterday. What a fun summer I am having.  Well, I'm going to Dorset this evening, which should be fun fun fun. I'll probably be back later in the week, by the weekend most likely.  And that's about all there is to say. Of course I could moan about CocaCola, McDonalds, youth today, modern music, and the state of the health, transport and education systems, but I'll save it for another time.  Bye for now.

      Time for the next blog. I didn't do anything yesterday (no change there) but today was slightly more interesting. I took a trip into Bromley with mum this morning, for the main reason of getting me a new school bag, as the last one I had has now got a broken zip. Well, it was broken for ages, but decided to wait until the end of term to get a new one. And now I have one, the same model as  urlLink megatrobe's  but in different colours, for £15 from Lillywhites. And then we came home.  After finishing 'Reaper Man' yesterday, which was a very good book, I decided I must have something else to read. So I sallied forth to the local library to search for some pleasant reading material. I soon stumbled upon 'The Lord of the Rings', and after seeing each film at the cinema, renting the DVDs, and buying the DVD boxset, I decided to finally have a read of the book behind the film. 3 books, and I shall try to read them in 3 weeks (which is when they are due back) I never did like renewing books, always makes you look like a slow reader. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but... well... I'd like to finish in the time nonetheless. So, after a little reading today, I'm up to page 75, or half way through chapter 2. I don't stand a chance do I? 1500 pages... well, I may just make it. I am on holiday after all.  Which reminds me. I will be having a (hopefully) pleasant few days in Dorset with my family, starting on Tuesday. So there will likely be an absent of blogging during that short time. In the time I am gone, do not despair, my good readers. There are plenty of other good blogs out there (few as good as mine of course). Or you could take up reading and juggling. Though not at the same time...  Bye for now.   Weather:  Sunny, cloudy, overcast. A mixture really.  Reading:  The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring  Listening to:  Star Wars techno music (yep, very sad. I do know)  Watching:  Liar, Liar earlier. Naked Gun Later.

      Doesn't time fly when you're not doing anything? It's nearly 19:00 and looking back at the day I haven't really done anything at all. I suppose I've just been on the computer most of the day. What a waste of time.... I had 2 games of chess too, this time on level 2, I won one, and lost one. I may play again later for a best of three. I also spent a while writing a rather good legend for my nation Pisylvania, which can be viewed on the forum. (If you're not a member of our forum, leave a comment if you really want a read.) I'm quite proud of it, and I think I've found something I really enjoy. I've only written about 500 words so far, but more will be comming along shortly. And finally I had a generally uneventful shopping trip to Sainsburys with mum, the only mildly interesting thing happening being that I saw our (former) assistant head of year walking along Beckenham high street. I looked away quickly before he had a chance to notice I was there. And that was my day. Not particually interesting, I'll try and do something more worth while tomorrow. Like learn some more Esperanto, or... or.... well, something other than playing  urlLink neopets  games. Even though I haven't actually done that for a few days.  And now for something different. Or not.  Bye for now.

      I've actually had a more interesting time these past 2 days then I generally have during the holidays. Wow, not being at school sure is fun; knowing I need not have an early morning for the next 8 weeks or so, doing only what I want to... gosh, I do pity those younger kids still at school. And those ones going into year 7 in September - they have 5 years of school. 5 years... Woah, it seems like such a long time ago I was in year 7, but... does it? I still remember it clearly... those PHSE lessons, those library lessons... it all went so fast. Yep, time is slowly slipping away. Makes you feel slightly old even; having left compulsory schooling.   Anywho, enough reminiscing, I have tales of old to speak of. Ok, so they're not really old. And they're not really tales, but hell, I'll put them down here anyway. Yesterday was a very good day, the second best day of my free time so far (after Thorpe Park least Tuesday). I got a crowded train and an empty tube up to South Kensington, met  urlLink nonnesuch ,  urlLink megatrobe  and  urlLink deutsches d then headed off through the tunnel to the London Scinece Museum, a truly excellent place. Plenty of good stuff to have a look at, with lots of computer touch screen things to twiddle round with. Spending about 3 hours in there, we sallied forth to a small shop not so far from the museum where we purchased ourselves some lunch which we ate on the lawn in front of the Natural History museum (just down the road from the science museum). With a quick consumption of our food, next was the natural history museum, looking at lots of dead things in jars, and dinosaur skeletons and models of strange animals. Wasn't as good as the science museum, but nice architecture though.  urlLink Nonnesuch  was good enough to point this out about once every 15 minutes :D But it  was  a good building though. I'd like a building like that...  Getting home after that fun-filled day, I found that my legs were extremely painful, most probably because I'd been standing up all day (instead of playing on the computer, chess, or reading), but they're better now, thankfully.  So, what has the Davester been doing today then? Not much at all really. :( A little bit o' internet, but mainly reading Reaper Man, and playing on that aforementioned chess computer. However I have found an excuse for losing on it a few days ago. I had to replace the battereies, and after putting new ones in, it set back to the default level, which is certainly more... challenging than good ol' level 1, which I cam beat easily, of course. And finally... I got out my old Atari 2600, modled here in all it's 1980s glory   Yep, old isn't it? Quite interesting though, to see how far computer games have come in the past few years. Apparently we bought it in 1993, for £30. Well, this is probably the best game we have for it, entitled "River Raid"   Looks quite lame, doesn't it? It is. :( Well, I still have the megadrive, and if I really want to be ahead of the times, I could even have a go on my Play Station, with 3D games! Woah, a bit wild for me :)  Anywho, ta ta for now my dear readers.   Weather:  Windy, then rain, now drizzle. Miserable day.

      I didn't get round to blogging yesterday, so today's should be an extra long post, but I doubt it will be. So, what was happening in Davetopia yesterday? (That's a metamophorical thingy Mr 'Oh Boyyyyys' Herbert went on about, actually refering to my life). Now I come to think of it, I can't really remember. Now, not remembering where you have been for a whole day could be a sign of being totally messed up on drugs and drink, but most of my readers know that I would never do such a heathen thing. Tis bad for the liver. :) I think I just played a bit on the computer, did a bit o' reading, learnt a bit o' Esperanto, and generally just hanging around the house. However, I did watch 'Police Academy 2', a rather good film, and a sequal to 'Police Academy' (no prizes for guessing that). Twas quite funny, with some great characters.  Well, today was slightly more interestng, being as although in the morning I did not much more than play on the computer, in the afternoon I did something I haven't done in a long long time. And that was.... Play golf. What a great game it is. I went with my sister and my dad, for a round of 9 holes at some place called 'Sparrows Den', in West Wickham I think. I lost, unfortunately, with sister comming second and dad comming first, with scores of 51, 45 and 44. So I wasn't so far behind. And we had an ice cream after, which made up for the dissapointment of losing. And I'm certainly bette than last time I played. It's quite a good game, the duds should go together at some point, and make another outing for the summer's dud-a-thon.  Oh, and I lost a game of chess to level 1 on the chess computer, which was rather embarresing, but meh. Practice will prevail. Hopefully.  And finally, this is a rather good quote from 'Reaper Man' that I'm reading at the moment: 'The Bursar thought he was anorexic, as everytime he looked in the mirror he saw a fat man looking back at him. It was the Archchancellor standing behnind him, yelling at him'  Anywho, bye for now   Weather:  Cloudy, sunny, overcast  Reading:  Reaper Man  Listening to:  'Good Stuff' - Prince Ali in some weid language...

      Evenin' all. I haven't been on the computer much today, but then that's probably a good thing. The main reason being that my mum's been telling me how I must tidy my room, and help clean the house in general, as yesterday I mentioned I was bored. I knew I would regret saying that. So, I vacumed my bedroom, and sorted out my wardrobe, to get rid of old clothes that no longer fit, and also just re-aranged all my clothes in general. Things look so much better when re-arranged. :) I was then told off by my sister for using the vacuum at 8:20 in the morning, so I stopped, deciding to do it later. I then did it later. So, with a (fairly) clean room, I had a go on the computer, and made an attempt at re-earning my  urlLink neopets  fortune. Made a bit o' money, which I will continue to do through the summer, and try to get a good house, and maybe train my pet up a bit. Yes, it is a total waste of time, but very satisfying.  Well, that was the morning, and then came the afternoon. Altough tidying the front room only one week ago, my mum still insisted that it was messy, so we ended up cleaning and organising that for most of the afternoon, which was far from fun. But I suppose worthwhile, as it is now almost spotless, with only a few hints of the fact that a family live here. And then came the evening. Whence I decided it was time for a blog, not having done one today. And here it is. Not a great one, but probably not the worst, just turning into waffle now really, so I guess I'll give it a rest for another day, most likely tomorrow.  But before I go, I will take my time to mention that several good films are on tv tonight. Firstly, starting at 2000, X Men, a fairly good film, featuring 'Jean Luc Picard', this guy here:   who, according to  urlLink dickybod , looks just like me. Can't think why, he's old, and bald, and I have neither of those characteristics. Actually, it's not really him in the film, more this person:   The same actor, of course.  Anywho, after X Men, depending on how tired I am, I may watch 'True Lies', a good Arnie film, full of guns and explosions, which are of course what his films are all about. Some mildly ammusing parts in it though. Doesn't finish 'til 1 in the morning though, but meh, I'm not doing anything tomorrow.  And I will have to video 'The Thing... From Another World', a 1950s sci-fi horror film about aliens, on at the same time as 'True Lies'. It sounds quite funny...  Well, that shall be all for now, toodles all.  Bye all.   Weather:  Sunny, some clouds. Not too warm though  Reading:  Reaper Man, Terry Pratchett  Listening to:  Rolf Harris - Two Little Boys  Watching:  X Men, True Lies, The Thing...

       urlLink Dickybod  finished the Harry Potter series before me. Well, I half expected it, I'm not a fast reader, and if he wants to beat me at something, he will generally stay up all night until he has. I read a litle more of book 5 today, and I'm now one chapter from the end, which I will read later today, before probably going back to the good ol' DiscWorld books. I've been thinking about whether I should have a change of book type, as I can't even remember the last book I read that wasn't fantasy or set in the past or future. I suppose Catch 22 would qualify, but that was incredibly dull, and I didn't get much past chapter 8 or so before I moved onto something more... unreal. I may try Lord of the Rings at some point, but the sheer length of them is what's putting me off, and from what I've heard, they are either really dull and long winded, or excellent. I suppose I'll find out for myself at some point.  I had to go into school today, for the meer thrill of handing in text books that I have been using for the past 2 years. I didn't have to go in until 0930, but still, it was totally pointless. We could have handed books in on the first day back. So, I was hanging around in ques, waiting for teachers to acknowledge that the book I was handing in wasn't in pieces, and then after about half an hour, I was free to walk all the way home for the next half hour. And hours journey with half an hour in school. Yep, that was definately worth it. But it did mark the VERY LAST TIME that I have to wear a school uniform. Never again will I be restricted on what to wear, unless I get a sucky job where you have to wear a uniform, but I doubt it. Although we have to look smart next year, ie wear a suit and tie, we still have a little slack. Which reminds me, I really need to go out and buy me a suit or two at some point for next year. Well, I've got plenty of time for that. Right up to the 6th September, where we have 'enrollment day'. What fun that will be.  Anywho, I got home, played on the internet a bit, did the washing up from breakfast, did a bit o' reading, played on the internet a bit more and being bored started todays blog. I wonder if I can get a blog done every day through the summer. Well, it's worth a try I suppose, although it will probably turn out to be really boring after a while. But hey! That's my life, and I'm not forcing anyone to read it. (Please read my blog, I NEED readers...) Yes, I'm just rambling on here, so time for a rapid change of subject me thinks.  The Weather. Yes, that's always worth talking about. It's been mainly sunny cloudy today, moving on to overcast for a bit. And then suddenly, with no warning at all, it started raining very very hard. Which came on incredibly quickly. And then there was lightning, then thunder, which repeated a few times, then it stopped. And now it is back to cloudy. I did however, in the span of about 5 minutes that is lasted, manage to work out the distance the storm was from my house, using the fun fun fun distance = speed x time equation. Turns out I was 2,400 m from the storm. Now isn't that interesting?  That shall be all for today, bye bye all.   Weather:  Now, cloudy.

      My reading is comming along nicely now, I'm up to chapter 30 of Harry Potter, although I doubt I'll finish it today. Definatly tomorrow though. I haven't spoken to  urlLink Dickybod  recently though, not since Tuesday evening, so I've no idea where he's up to. His lack of appearences on MSN though can only mean he has been reading a lot though.  So, apart from reading, I haven't really done much at all today at all. I've spent a while on the computer too, so it's been another boring day for me.  Well, it's leavers day tomorrow, which means I have to go to school, carrying all my heavy textbooks which I've borrowed for the past 2 years, and hand them back. What fun that will be. :)  I'll probably have a game of chess later, I need to improve quite a bit, I'm not too good at it at the moment. Oh yes, and I also intend to learn to write with my left hand, which I think may come in useful one day. Or not, but it's a worthwhile skill to have.  That will be all for now, a nice short post again.  Bye bye.

      It is blogging time again. I really should try to post here more often, but… well, like most people I know, I am not doing much of interest.  Today was an ok day; seeing as I actually went out. In the morn I went to Bromley with my mum and oldest sister to look for a suit for me to wear next year at school. We had to look round for ages, as most suits were at least size 40, and those of you who know me will realise that I am nowhere near that. So, after looking in Marks and Spencer, Next, Burtons, BHS and Debenhams, we eventually found a nice little shop in the heart of the Glades Shopping Centre called ‘Suits You’, as you know doubt have already guessed, a suit shop. With loads of sizes! We settled for the smallest one they had, a size 34 dark navy jacket and trousers for… £150! £150!!! Can you believe that?!?! Sooooo expensive. But we were all fed up and tired, so that’s what we got. Oh, and I also bought some new swimming trunks, even though I still don’t like swimming. Oh well, I suppose it’s just something you need even if you never use them.   Came home, and didn’t do a lot else. However, there is a little good news in the generally depressing life of Dave. I finally convinced my mum that dial-up internet is not really practical in this day and age, so together (with the help of good  urlLink Megatrobe ) we ordered BT 512K for £17.99/month (I think) for the first year, then £25.99 after that. So fairly good. The modem should be arriving one week tomorrow. What’s the betting that something will go wrong? I reckon at least evens. But if I’m very lucky, in a week and a day, I should be blogging through a nice reliable fast internet connection. Whether it will turn out to be either of these waits to be seen :)   Also been learning Esperanto, as you all already know. Oh, and if some strange foreign person who I don’t know in the slightest who found my blog whilst searching for ‘Harry Potter’ or something just as random can also speak Esperanto, please leave a comment or email me. This doesn’t include you nonnesuch, even if you do seem a little strange at some times; I’m fairly sure you’re not foreign.  :)  Dave’s done for now.

      Another day that didn’t involve staying in the house. Well, in the morning I read a bit of my book, and watched the first half of the Shawshank Redemption, which I taped from last night. Seemed fairly good, but before I had finished it my mum announced that me, mum and my 2 sisters were to take a trip to Tonbridge, a fairly nice town in the South somewhere. It was also announced that we were to go swimming in the outdoor pool there. This wouldn’t have been a problem if it weren’t for the following facts.  1) I have not been swimming for about 2 years (excluding going to a friends house and going in his pool, but there wasn’t much swimming.  2) I’m not even sure if I can swim anymore.  3) My swimming trunks have not been worn for at least a year, and so I’m not sure if they still fitted.  So, I tried to suggest somewhere else to go, but no one else would hear of it, so I packed my things and we left by about 11:00.   We got there, and on a small patch of grass by the pool, we ate a lunch that we had prepared earlier. (sandwiches, crisps, and bits of cucumber and raw carrot with some tasty dip things – lovely). Eating that, as it was a nice day I decided to sit back against a nearby wall whilst listening to some of my music on a CD player. And here I was so comfortable that I ended up laying right down on our picnic mat and sunbathing fully clothed. That’s the way to do it – you don’t get burnt :) Anyway, I decided not to bother with all the changing, getting wet, drying and everything else that comes with swimming, so I lay there in all my peace. Then after 1 hour 45 minutes of paying to come in, people with black wristbands – that was us – were called out. Although I was ready to go by then anyway. So we walked back to the car, dumped our stuff, and walked round the nearby park. I had a bit of fun doing summersaults on a rail held about 4 foot in the air, and also swinging upside down by my legs. Should have taken a photo, but didn’t, so you’ll have to take my word for it. I probably looked like a right prat, but it was fun :)  And then we came home, and all had a barbeque in the garden, with burnt burgers et al. And now here I am.  Ta for now.   Weather:  Hot, sunny.

      Ahhh, today is a good day isn’t it? And why would that be, I don’t hear you ask. The sun is shining, it’s the middle of the summer holiday…. And I have a new computer!!! (Deserving at least 3 exclamation marks). Although sadly, however, it is not currently in use, as:  1) There is no MS Office on it, so nothing to write my blog in. (I write it in Word, then copy and paste to blogger, saving as I go. I have an unpleasant experience of writing straight into the blogger box. Yes, I could use notepad, but then see point 2…)  2) There is no internet on it yet, so again I would be unable to use blogger. My mum does promise however (something she rarely does, preferring to use a good ol’ ‘maybe’) to get some BT discount broadband, which she hasn’t got round to ordering yet.  So I am using the old computer, which is just about adequate for the purpose of blog writing. Anyway, more about the new one! It has 256MB RAM (still not quite sure what that does, but the higher the better I was told), a 2.7 GHz processor (some sort of speed thing, I think), and more hard drive capacity than I can ever see myself using (80GB to be precise, but as I am doing just fine using 10GB on my old computer, this should be plenty)  Anywho, the day went as follows. At 0800 I woke up from a nice long sleep, 9 hours in fact. I ate some breakfast, and then discussed the possibilities of taking a trip to PC World Croydon with my mum and sister. We also needed a new fridge, so decided that we should order it in the Argos near-by. So, at 1100 we left for Croydon, on a stifling hot day. We arrived, and decided Argos to be first as we missed the turning for PC World. Ok, we didn’t actually miss the turning, but I figured I needed a slight amount of humour in the blog. So, we went to Argos and qued… cued… waited in line for a while and then placed our order of one £220 fridge freezer, to be delivered in the next 10 days. This done, we made our way to PC World, and took a look round. Eventually we found a nice one, for only £400, without a screen (the one we were to buy). So, the sale assistant took us to sit by a computer where she tried to sell us a 3 or 5-year guarantee for £100 or £150, which my mum flat out refused. The sales assistant then ordered me (didn’t even say ‘please’ – total rudeness) to go to the front of the store and fetch a trolley, which I did without difficulty. We then waited while she took the trolley and fetched our computer. We then bought a £30 printer for my sister’s laptop, which she will need in university next year. And then we came home. Phew…  Arrived home very hungry, so I made my sister, mum and me scrambled egg, which actually turned out very nice. Also had some crisps and half a mango. Next I unpacked the new computer, connected it to the old monitor, and changed the horrible Packard-Bell wallpaper to one of the preset nicer ones. Then realising there was little to do on it without internet or Office, I turned it off, and connected the old base unit to the monitor again.  What a good day it has been.  Ta for now.   Weather:  Very hot, very sunny  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves  Listening to:  Matrix Revolutions soundtrack  Watching:  Unbreakable later tonight  Confused about:  What RAM is (tell me again please, in the comments)  Annoyed with:  Nothing! Great day!  Mood:  Very good :)

      I haven’t been bothered to blog here for a while; since Saturday in fact. But a few things have happened, which may just be worth writing about.   Firstly, on Tuesday I went to Steve’s house with nonnesuch, megatrobe and deutsches. ‘Twas quite a fun day (well, it beats dickybod’s slave labour thing he had to do :)  ); in which we played monopoly (original version – no Star Wars fancy what-not) and also on the Gamecube, which was quite fun. Unfortunately nonnesuch won monopoly, by getting hotels on the reds and oranges, although I only came in third place out of 5, so not all bad. I even had several houses on Mayfair and Park Lane, but it only really paid off once, when Dave landed there, and went bankrupt. It wasn’t enough to cover what I had to pay on the Oranges and Reds though. Steve was out next, then me, then Jon. But I did ok.   During this game, and after, we played on the Gamecube consol. Mainly Smash Brothers (a fighting game) and Mario Kart (Racing). I did pretty badly at both, as I don’t have one at home, but neither does nonnesuch, so we did about the same. I also got a go on a Sonic game, which wasn’t all that good.   And finally, we had some fun taunting someone from school by the name of ‘Paul’. It was great fun, especially when Dave and Richard played him at Generals (a war game), and he gave up :) We then taunted him over MSN for a while, and then played ‘You are an Arse’ to him several times, to our hilarity. More Gamecube and a thunderstorm later it was time for us to go home. I walked the little way home, and didn’t do much for the rest of the evening.  Then yesterday me and dad went to Currys in Catoford to take another look at fridges (thrills) but I also got a look in PC world, but there wasn’t much of a selection of computers there. I will get a new one sooner or later. Hopefully.  And then this morning I went to Sainsburys with my sister, and bought a bit o’ food for the coming days. Fun, fun, fun.  I haven’t been doing a lot else; I cleaned my room yesterday, and I’ll probably finish tidying it later. I’ve also been reading more LOTR; Isengard has just been flooded, and Merry and Pippin have told their long-winded story of how it was done. And yesterday I spent about an hour learning Esperanto, which means I am now on lesson 5 out of 10 – Question words. I haven’t really learnt them yet though.  And lastly, I watched a film called 'One Eight Severn' last night, staring the guy who played Mace Windu (Samuel L Jackson). 'Twas about him (a teacher) being stabbed, moving to a new school, and then making even more enemys, killing one of his enemies, and then killing himself in russian roulette with his other enemies. His arch enemy also killed himself in russian roulette. What a depressing film.  That shall be all for now, Bye all.     Weather:   Storm on Tuesday, hot and sunny since then  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves (Still)  Listening to:  Star Wars trilogy soundtrack - Imperial March  Watching:  Fraiser earlier, 187 last night  Confused about:  How the top of a cupboard gathers so much dust  Annoyed with:  Nowt really  Mood:  Good
