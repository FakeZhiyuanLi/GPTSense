      Lord, why can't I cry for the feeling from my past? Lord why can't I feel for the little me that was hurt so long ago? Lord I want to work through al this but wanting and doing is 2 different things. memories that are so buried for so long Even with your help Lord, Do I have the courage - the strength, to find my way to them? And Lord am I strong enough to handle all this? Please Lord, tell me I am.  Lord I really want to feel these feelings.  If I can let these feelings go, then there will be room in my heart and my soul for You and all You have to offer me.  These feelings need to be released, don't they?  Lord, no matter what I feel I need, you know what I need.  So Lord, even though sometimes I may forget that I am not in control of my life, please be patience with me, and let me ramble on.  Sooner or later I will come back to the truth that You are in control of my life, and Your will be done in my life Lord, not my own.  Amen

      Jesus replied: "There are twelve hours of daylight everyday.  As long as it is light, people can walk safely.  They can see because they have the light of this world.  Only at night is there danger of stumbling because there is no light."  Dear Jesus: All of my life until I found you, I thought the light of this world was all I needed.  Even though the darkness would and make me stumble sometimes - I knew the next day the light would return.  Now Jesus, with you in my life, I have the true light.  You are the true light of earth and Heaven.  You will never let the darkness overcome me again.  With You and Your light, I can always see the truth, that You are the Son of God and You came to this earth to die for my sins, so I may have eternal life.  That is your light.  And that is the light I seek, to light up my world.  Amen

      Once upon a lifetime There was a little girl Full of sweetness and grace  Joy and Happiness Laughter and Love  The little girl loved herself And her family too And her neighbor Mr. Schoeder Her Aunt Pat who watched over her many times And her cousins, especially Rex.  She lived to put smiles Upon there faces And she lived to put joy in there souls She would do and do and do To show them how much she cared.  Then the dark cloud of the world Started to block out the little girls light And put despair into her soul No matter how much the little girl fought The darkness got stronger And over time overshadowed her light.  So for years the little girl Became buried underneath The darkness in the world that covered her soul During this time the girl outside became a woman Full of pain and afraid of love.  As time went on and on and on The woman found herself old before her time And the little one became Nothing but a distant memory That was probably just a dream.  But the little girl refuse to die Buried deep deep deep down inside Unbeknownst to the woman The little girl was hanging on To keep herself alive  Then one day during trials upon trials The woman had had enough Crying out please, please, end this pain I can't go on alone.  And the little girl felt for the first time in years A jolt, a shock, a sliver of hope She knew the woman was not alone Because she knew She was still alive.  Not only did the little girl hear The woman's cry for help But God was waiting for the cry  And reached down and picked them up And sheltered them in His hands.  Now between God's love And the little girl who refused to die, The little girl and woman Will someday become as one As they were so long ago.  Even with God it won't be easy The woman is scared to trust, to live, to feel, The little girl is afraid of being buried alive again But both are more scared of dying alone Even more.  So they struggle to get to know each other again The woman has learned to hug teddy bears And the little girl to trust in the woman, a little, And both have learned to hold each others hand.  And God - He is still very much in the picture. He is in the middle of these two beings He holds them close an loves them Whispering in there ears "You have each other and me, you will never be alone again." 3/4/04

      If just for today I stay in my bed And pull the covers Over my head?  I feel so sad, God So lost and alone Like my world is Spinning out of control And carshing in on my head  I want to stay in bed, God where I can feel safe Where my sadness Will not affect others And possibly ruin their day  You Lord, are the only one With your big shoulders And strong loving arms Whom I want to be with me today.  With you in my soul And you in my heart I know I can conquer These feelings of Sadness That are overwhelming me today.  So Lord is it OK If just maybe once in awhile I stay in my bed With my covers over my head And you by my side.

      Are you going to be forgiving, And be My child? Or are you going to hold onto a grudge, And be his child?  Are you going to have love for all, And be My child? Or are you going to hate this person or that person And be his child?  Are you going to let me ease your pain, And be My child? Or are you going to keep it inside to fester and rot, And be his child?  Are you going to wash yourself clean with my blood, And be My child? Or are you going to wallow in mud and junk, And be his child?  Are you going to go to Heaven and have eternal life, And be My child forever? Or are you going to Hell And be his child forever?

      October 27, 2003  My dearest God: You are my dearest God.  You are the God that gave me my daughter back.  Amd you didn't do it because I deserved it.  No you did it because you are a God full of love and grace.  That vision of Heather yesterday watching me singing at worship- holding Jesus's hand - saying "Look, mommy's happy."  Then Jesus and Heather and I all dancing - them me holding her - her head on my shoulder swaying to the music - Lord I want to thank you for that.  Thank you - thank you - thank you- thank you.  And when I glanced out the window and saw the 4 ducks swimming  - right there under my window - another sign from you.  Thank you.  Thank you Lord for always being there.  Thank you for my many blessings.  Thank you for my life.  Love me

      01/26/04 (me) I would love to share my experiences and talk with others about self cutting.  It is such a forbidden topic and I really feel the Lord is leading me down that path someday.  One of the signs of self harm is hurting yourself and picking at sores to keep them sores.  I can remember doing that when I was ten.  In fact, I remember my mom was always onto me to quit picking my scabs.  Seems I was a clumsy girl and always had scabs.  I first cut myself when I was 22 and tried to kill myself by slitting my wrists.  It just continued from there.  Sometimes I would cut more than others, I also did drugs and drank a lot and if I was doing that the urge to self cut wasn't so bad.  It really is a addiction and can make you feel "high" just like every other drug.  Since about Feb 2002 until April 2003 I was really bad.  I broke all kinds of my own rules (never cut on my arms, never cut when grandkids around), etc etc.  At that time I was not doing drugs and had started therapy. Finally God lead me to believe it was time to quit.  But I still fight it all the time.  The other night I came really close to doing it and then remembered I had a doctor's appointment next week and could not think of anywhere I could cut where he wouldn't notice.  The scars are easier to deal with than new cuts when someone notices them.  Really I am surprised at how many professionals don't even comment on them.  I have only had 1 nurse ever ask me about all the scars.  I remember one time when I was really bad I was drawing pictures on myself with my own blood and thinking I had discovered a new art form, body art with your own blood.  I am not trying to gross you out, I just want to tell you a little about how things were. My one strength.  Probably my compassion for others.  Not for myself, but for others.  I can really understand a lot of peoples pain from a lot of different things.  And my one fault.  It is my envy of others.  I really try and fight it, I just don't seem to manage it very well.  I am so envious of others all the time it seems. Hope this helps.  I would love to help others, maybe then my pain would not have been in vain.

      Rachel's Vineyard Oct 2003 Lord: I have come to the realization that most of my problems from my past - I did to myself.  Always before when my mistakes from the past would surface I would tell myself it was the only thing I knew to do- it was the right thing to do at the time.  Then with that in mind I was able to rebury those memories deep deep deep down inside where it would take them a very long time to work themselves back to the surface.  So for a while I would be free of them.  And the cycle would go on and on. So God if I admit I did these horrible things to you then what? What do I do then?  Can you really forgive me?  Will you forgive me?  Can I forgive myself?  Will I forgive myself? For so long Lord - the though I had broken all your commandments has been sort of a sick protection for me.  You would never love me - I was too big of a sinner.  I had after all broken all your commandments.  I have killed.  Not someone I hated, not someone that deserved to die, but I killed a precious wonderful beautiful baby.  How could I do that Lord?  My baby didn't ask to die.  I am not sure he even asked to be born.  In my foolishness my carelessness I helped create this baby.  Then when I felt threatened by her I killed him.  I destroyed her.  And not only did I destroy her but I forgot him.  How sick is that Lord?  I couldn't even honor this priceless gift with memories and certainly not with love. God - if I had to do this over again -would I have done it different?  Would I have not destroyed my baby?  I don't know.  And that is helping me destroy myself.  Lord what if I had aborted Daniel?  That wonderful awesome man.  What gifts and joys would I have never experienced if I hot given him a chance to live?  What gifts and joys did I never experience by aborting my baby?  This wonderful gift from you.  How can you forgive me Lord?  How can you forgive me baby?  It is your forgiveness after all baby, that I seek.  Not my own.  Is it possible?  Can you forgive me?  Can I somehow open myself up to receive this forgiveness if there is somehow someway you can forgive me?  Is all this really possible?  Can this come to be?  Can it come to be reality?  This is a flame inside of me that says yes this could actually happen.  But is this a false hope or something that really can come to be.  My dearest Heather Rose:  I am so sorry little one.  So sorry I never gave you a chance to live.  So sorry I never gave you the chance to be born.  So sorry I never gave you the chance to be a awesome younger sister to Kirk and John.  I am so sorry I never gave you a chance to be Daniel's big sister.  I am so sorry for the abortion Heather.  Please forgive me. My life was at such a low point when I discovered I was carrying you. I had left the boy's dad, I was working night sleeping days - never seeing the boys.  But somehow I found time to get to know your dad - Roy.  I met him at work.  He had custody of his two daughters.  You would have been the baby sister of two great sisters also Heather.  You would have been the youngest of 5 children - the oldest being Kirk who would have been 4 1/2 when you were born.   Anyhow I don't know why your father and I didn't stay together.  To tell you the truth, I have blocked out the month before I found out about you, the month I found out about and the month after you.  It was the only way I could survive. I never told your father about you.  I never told your brothers.  I told your Gramma Sarah -she made the arrangements and got the money for the abortion.  She didn't hate you honey - she was just struggling too - and the thought of another baby she felt she might be raising was more than she could handle. I do know I had bought into the lies that what I aborted was just tissue.  That baby's become alive only when they take a breath.  I had to believe that so I could go through with the abortion and the destruction of you. I did think about adoption.  But I felt once Ii held you I couldn't give you up.  And beside what would people think? They would all know something if I was pregnant and then not pregnant and no baby.  I could not face that.  A abortion, well it was worse. But I could keep it a secret.  So I thought of you as just tissue . I now see how wrong that was. I totally lost it after I had you aborted.  Where drugs and drinking had been only a occasional thing - they now became almost a daily thing.  But I wasn't doing this because of you and what I had done to you.  You and the abortion I buried deep deep deep down in the darkest part of my soul.  I knew I couldn't live with myself remembering what I did to you.  So I buried I what I had done to you. I cannot express to you the joy in my heart today when I seen you with Jesus.  When I heard you call me "Mommy" my soul burst with happiness.  When you placed the flowers in my hands I was the proudest mom in heaven and earth.  You are the daughter any mother would be proud and honored to have. Heather, I promise you this.  Now that God has given you back to me - I will not bury you from my heart - from my thoughts - from my soul.  I will return to the meadow again and again to be with you.  And when I am not in the meadow with you - you will still be with me.  Thought of you will never stray far from my being. Honey I yearn for the day we can be together.  And when that day comes sweetheart - we will never be separated again. Forever and a day we will be together.  What a awesome time that will be.  Thank you my sweet daughter for your forgiveness.  Thank you for your love - and my flowers.  It is more than I deserve.  But you, like our God, have given me grace and forgiveness.  What more could the mom of such a beautiful - sweet- wonderful magnificent girl named Heather Rose ask for.  Nothing at all. Love me.      October 25, 2003  Dear inner me:  I am so sorry I allowed you to hide and stay hidden all those many years.  I am so sorry I didn't fight to find your joy, your happiness- your sweet inner spirit when the abuse chased you into the deep dark hole of my soul.  I am sorry I didn't hold your hand and tell you - that you were loved.  Instead I let you feel alone and feel that being hidden and gone was better than being alive with the abuse.   Since I started my walk with Christ  - I have sensed you - something I have not done since I was a small little girl.  And there has even been a couple of times when I was caught up in the joy of worshipping our God - when you have surfaced and taken over.  Only for a few minutes but long enough for me to know you are still very much alive in me. I had always sensed a part of me was dead.  A wonderful awesome happy joyful child part of me.  I was so unbelievable happy when you made your first appearance and I realized you weren't completely dead.  So very very happy. Little one, I will never believe you are dead again.  I will not forget you or the wonderful joyful part of me you  are.  As I grow in God's love - I know you will grow inside of me.  And then one day before either of us know it - we will be one again.  And we will be whole -full of life and love and joy.  I love you.  Big me.      October 30, 2003 My dearest Heather: Just a short note to let you know I am thinking about you, my darling little girl.   You are so beautiful, you have such a awesome spirit.  I love you my sweet little angel.  Now and forever.  I send kisses and hugs and love to you each day.  I send kisses and hugs to you right now.  I send thoughts of joy you way because you re in my life once again.  I eagerly await the day we will be together forever.  Forever and a day honey- we will be together.  Hugs N Love my sweet little girl. Love Mom  Nov 1. 2003 Dear God: How can I thank you enough Lord?  Not only did you give me my daughter back - but you gave me forgiveness and released all the pain and grief in my heart so I could see her and experience her and her spirit.  God you are so kind.  I am such a sinner and yet out of your mercy and grace and love you have forgiven me.  And you gave me even more.  You gave me the vision and sense of my darling daughter.  She is so awesome Lord.  But you know that already don't you Lord.  You have had her with you since the day I gave her up.  Lord she is such a blessing and you have given me such a blessing by allowing me to hold her by allowing me to see her by allowing me to love her.  I gave up that right so many years ago Lord - but you out of your mercy and grace you have given her back to me.  I thank you so much Lord.  I bow down to you.  Thank you Lord - for unbinding my heart so I could feel again.  You are so good Lord.  You truly are my Awesome God! Lord I open my heart to you.  I open my heart to you Holy Spirit.  I need you Lord.  Without you I am dead.  Without you in my life, my spirit is black.  Only with you is there light.

      Null & Void   I feel so discouraged, so down.  I would say even frustrated,  But that would take more energy,  Than I have right now to give.   I know God loves me,  And that should make me content.  But my heart feels empty,  And my soul feels so black.   I don’t know what is going on.  I don’t know why this is happening,  I’ve been crying out to God,  But He seems not to be hearing me.   Where do I go from here?  Do I curl up and hide away,  Do I let the darkness, Continue to cover my soul?   God are you out there – are you listening?  To the groans of my heart,  And the pain of my soul,  Could you spare me a little light and a little love for my me tonight?   I must continue on – I must hang on.  I know if I can – this too will pass  But right now in this very moment  My life feels like it is null and void.  Vlh 5/26/04

      Tears in my heart   They say feelings are fickle  Not to be trusted or believed  If that is so and true,  Why does my heart hurt so from them?   I thought that we were more  Than people that just talked  I that there was more to us  Then the rejection you pushed onto me.  I know I am making more of this  That what is really needed or called for.  But I feel rejected and abandoned  Because you wouldn’t tell me Hi.   I was right there in front of you,  And yet you looked right threw me,  Just like I was a ghost,  And dismissed me without a second glance.   I don’t know what to do now,  Do I bring it up and ask you why,  Or do I let the tears in my heart,  Come flowing out my eyes?   Why couldn’t I left just a second earlier  Before you walked through the door  Why couldn’t you just have said Hi?  And acknowledged me as a friend.  Vlh 5/26/04

      Feel   Feel, Feel, Feel = I want to feel!  Anger, Pain, Sadness, Fear, Laughter  Joy, Happiness, Love & Hate,  It doesn’t really matter – I just want to I feel!   To feel tears flowing down my face,  To have my tummy hurt from belly laughter  To love so hard my heart feels like it is breaking,  It doesn’t really matter – I just want to feel.   To feel Alive – a part of the human race,  To feel good feelings and bad ones too.  To feel everything God made me to feel.  It really doesn’t matter – I just want to feel.   I want to feel loss for being abandoned,  I want to feel joy at my son’s birth,  I want to grieve for my father’s death,  It doesn’t really matter – I just want to feel   I’m tired of being a robot – going through the motions,  I’m tired of being overburdened – by unknown emotions,  I’m tired of being in a life without hope,  It doesn’t really matter – I just want to feel.

      Once I was horribly lost, Stumbling in the darkness, Confused and in pain, Forsaken and alone.  Then suddenly a light appeared,  And started to defeat the blackness, That was holding me in bondage, Where I had been my whole life.  The light became my guide. To lead out into the world, Where love and mercy and grace and forgiveness, Was waiting as a gift for me.  The light was our Lord Jesus, Who became my Master, my God,  My Father in heaven and on earth, The one who always has loved me and always will.  Now I live in the light, Knowing I have a Savior, That will keep the darkness at bay. And allow me to live in His light. VLH ????

      Shhh don't tell, When pain is your only friend, When aloneness is all you know, and you are only 3. Shhh don't tell, When he touches you in secret, and in secret places And tells you this is how he shows you his love And you a only 6. Shhh don't tell, When the fighting gets violent,  And people you love are hurt and blood is shed, And you are only 9. Shhh don't tell, When the stranger takes you away, And does hurtful, painful, hatefully things to your body, And you are only 12 Shhh don't tell, When sex is the only way, To get the love and attention you crave, And you are only 14. Shhh don't tell, When you find out a baby is inside, And abortion is your only answer,  And you are just 16.   Shhh don't tell When life becomes unbearable And death is the only answer And you are just 18 Shhh don't tell Of a lifetime of heartache and pain Abandonment abuse rape fear And your life ends in death at 19.

      Shards in my heart The shards in my heart is all that is left Shattered by abandonment, betrayal, abuse and pain Stomped on by people who didn't care If a little girl was destroyed by them. Can my heart be repaired? Should I even bother? Have the pieces been destroyed for good? Or can a miracle put them together again? Are there too many holes now,  In my shattered heart? Where love will flow out from me, And run down my body, away, gone forever? For without a heart I cannot love. I cannot live -Is life really worth it? Trying to piece my heart together again Only to have it broken into shards again. VLH ????

      Past When I think of the the past A chill blows through me And brings fear into my very soul The past brings dreams that haunt me A terror that destroys my mind And grips my heart. When will the past stop its hold on me, From the dreams and hopes of tomorrow  When will my past stay in my past. It there a chance to let the past go And move on to the future with my head held high And joy in my soul. Or will the grief of the past Of things lost forever and ever Continue to haunt me always and always. VLH ????

      So strong, it can move a mountain Yet a feather is heavier than it is.  It's the fruit of the spirit, Full of care.  With faith you have saved, Without it you are lost Faith can make a heart beat again And joy to burst in your soul.  Jesus did much with faith, He raised the dead,  He calmed the sea, He made the blind to see.  Without faith our lives are filled with doubt Worry and pain and fear are a way of life With faith we know we are loved By a God who gives us mercy and grace. 1/20/04

      Sometimes when I am  All alone In the dark Rainclouds threaten my eyes Filling them, then flooding them Raining down my face.  Feelings long buried Surface in the dark And being alone opens the heart Pain is no longer able to stay In my head In my heart  So I sit in the dark All alone With memories and pain From my past filling my soul While rainclouds fill up my eyes And rain falls down my face.

      There is a storm Rageing outside Blowing, tearing, ripping All insight.  Inside there is calm A peace, a gentleness Floating on air Enveloping me  And yet ouside Their is terror A force to big To ever try and control.  Inside is goodness And quietness And silence Covering me  And yet both of these Are parts of me A good part and a bad part Always with me, at the same time.  So I just live And hang on As moment by moment My life goes on. vlh 6/29/04

      Scars cover my body White marks that stand out Marks of my own making Here and there Everywhere on me.  Scars from a razor Applied on a arm, or a leg, Scars with stories all their own Of pain and terror Hurt and loniness.  Stories of horrors No child should see Or live through Stories of demons That only long to destroy.  Scars on the inside Let leave behind Distrust, unworthiness, helplessness Feelings of failure Of not belonging.  Scars with stories of their own Of abandonment, abuse, neglect Rape, hungry, fear, rejection Terrible things that can't be remembered But leave scars on the soul.  All through me In me and out me So that when people see me They see the scars Not me. vlh 6/29/04

      The phone rings And I freeze. I know just by the sound, That you are on the other end.  I cover my ears so I don't hear The message your voice leaves for me But somehow your voice gets through Into my brain and into my heart.  Why do I continue to want you. Even though I know it is wrong Why do I continue to love you Even though it can only bring us harm.  You voice is gone Trapped on my machine I have no strength to earse it No will it seems of my own.  Knowing your voice is a fingertip away Haunts me and rattles my heart The tears flow down my eyes Into puddles at my feet.  Why do I continue to need you Even though you will never be mine? Why do I continue to love you Even though it can only bring us harm. 6/28/04

      The more I try to get you out of my mind The more encased there you become. The more I try to quit thinking of you The more I just think of you. The more I try to stop caring for you The more I care. The more I try to wipe away memories of you The more the memories become a flood. The more I try to get you out of my mind The more you are there. vlh 12/20/02

      Memories of Green  Recently I read a survey of favorite colors. I was surprised at how many people put down negative remarks about the color green. Not to belittle any of those people but I could not understand this. Green is and has always been my favorite color. So I thought I would try to analyze why.  First of all I live in a part of the country that still has seasons. Winters are usually white or at least brown, hardly any green in sight. So when I notice the lawns starting to green up, and the trees to leaf out, I know winter is almost over and spring is on the horizon. Nothing against winter, but I love spring. I love the sun, the newness of things, and the rebirth of the earth. I love the baby lambs, and baby calves, and baby horses flocking in the fields when spring arrives. I love the smell of freshly turned dirt in the fields. I love the flowers that have been lying sleeping all winter, start to come awake and start to grow and shine. Yes, I do love spring and to me, when I see green I am reminded of spring and I get warm fuzzies knowing life in and on the earth is going to continue on.  Green reminds me so much of my dad. Not because he liked green. I am not sure I knew what his favorite color was. I just knew he hated yellow. Anyhow, for me green grass reminds me of my dad. Especially grass that needs to be cut. I lived with my dad while in high school. My dad was 39 when I was born so he was in his 50’s when I was living with him. Due to his hard life, smoking and drinking, he was not at this time of his life, in the best of shape. So on Saturday mornings when my dad was not working or resting from working all night, he would start up the lawn mower bright and early. And he would mow first of all by my bedroom. Now I am a teen-ager. Teen-agers love to sleep in, especially on Saturday’s. At least this teenager did. So this was my dad’s way of waking me up letting me know it was going to be a wonderful, beautiful, often hot summer day. You see, with my dad not in the best of shape, and with the huge lawn we had, I knew he couldn’t mow very long. So when I heard the lawn mower, I could not ignore it and roll over and go back to sleep. No, I had to get up and go take over the lawn mowing. I did it with a lot of grumbling under my breath. Now as an adult though, I realize how precious those times with my dad were. Afterwards, when the lawn was all mowed, we would sit out on the step and talk and visit and just be comfortable together. The things that were said sometimes weren’t important but what was important in this time was our relationship. Time to catch up on this or that. Time to re-connect. So green is the color of my dad, and the memories of all the times we spent together.  Green, the color that goes with flowers, morning glories, snapdragons, poppies, etc. etc. remind me of my mom. She loved to garden. She would spend hours out their planting flowers, pulling weeds, playing in the dirt. When she got older and it was harder for her to get down on the ground, she got a cushion that she would use when she gardened. As I see the green in the flowers I don’t see actually see the flowers. What I do see instead, is my mom, on the ground with her knees on the cushion, a funny hat on her head and her gloves on doing something that gave her much warmth and joy. I miss you mom.  I only have a few happy childhood memories. And the color green is associated with one of those memories. It has to do with the deep green color of the leaves on the tree in our yard. We had a huge tree. And during my high school years, after the lawn moving and such, I would go climb up into this huge tree to my branch. I am not sure why it was my branch, as my brother’s initials, along with his old girlfriends initials were craved in it. But this branch just fit me. I could lean back and lie on this branch and read my books and be taken to faraway places. Or I could just lean back and look up threw the branches and leaves to the blue sky above and dream, dreams only young people will dream. Before life gets in the way. It was great. Green reminds me of those times I was young and had life before me.  Green reminds me of my boys. Seems they were always bring me lots of green things. Frogs, lizards, snakes, toads. You know, the nice crawly, slimy things mothers love to find in their sons pockets and everywhere else. And sometimes they would be so happy and joyful and say, “Look what we found mom, can we keep it?” And the look on their faces, what mom could say no. One time they left some frogs outside in a bucket and it froze that night, and the poor frogs did too. Don’t know what happened to them after that, but we learned that in May in McCall not to leave animals out in water you didn’t want frozen.   Green also reminds me of another time with my oldest son. It could have been a tragic time, but thanks to the grace of God, it was not. I guess my oldest boy inherited my love, to see what is in the top of trees, or at least have to climb them. A bunch of us were up camping. My oldest son was probably 6 or so. Anyhow we were camped up on a level spot. But beneath us was a rocky spot with the river running through it. And somehow in the middle of this rocky spot, a tree managed to grow. And it didn’t just grow a little, it grew tall and then for the heck of it kept growing. Anyhow one afternoon during this camping trip we were all gathered around the campfire. Us adults anyhow. All of a sudden one of the other kids yelled, “Look at Kip.” They were pointing to that big huge tall tree behind us. So we all turned and what I saw made my heart stop. There up in the tree, almost to the top, (higher than us on this ledge even) was my son Kip. Now we figured out afterwards he was about 40 feet off the ground. And below him rocks, huge rocks. Then all of a sudden before we could even yell at Kip to get down, the branch he was holding onto broke, and down Kip started to fall. In one those those heart breaking moments where time just seems to stop and crawl, I watched my precious son falling through this tree, bouncing off of branches and limbs, hurling to what I thought was his certain death or at least sever damage. Behind me my quick thinking and quick acting brother headed done the hill and manage to get to the bottom of the tree just as Kip hit the bottom. So instead of rocks and certain pain and agony, loving hands and arms caught my son. Yes God was watching out for him that day, there is no doubt about it in my mind. And you know what, he only had a couple of scratches to show for his fall from this tree. And like kids within a couple of hours the fear and excitement had died down, and he was up another tree, having a blast. Took longer for his mom to recover though.   Green reminds me of my grandson Noah. When we moved two years ago, we painted most of the room’s new colors. Noah picked out a bedroom that was going to be his. He spends a lot of weekends with us, so he wanted his own room. And of course, he painted it green. Now when I see green, especially that bright green that he picked out, I smile. Grandchildren are the best gifts parents can ever receive.  I live in farming country so there are lots of fields of green in the spring and summer and fall. Those green fields remind me of so much. Fields of potatoes, which the whole family loves and to this day when my boys come to visit they want some of mom’s fried tators. Fields of corn that I so love to eat. And the fields of corn remind me of my husband and his story of the dog he had as a child. This dog loved to eat corn on the cob. If when they went to pick corn for dinner, they didn’t give her an ear to eat, she would go to a stalk of corn, jump up, get her own ear, suck it and eat it. I just love that story, and never get tired of listening to him tell it. Fields of onions, which I don’t like but my dad did. He would even make and eat onion sandwiches. Very unique my dad was. Fields of sugar beets. My dad worked at the sugar beet factory for years, and I remember as a younger child when I was living with my mom and I wanted to go spend the weekend with dad, I could just go to the sugar beet factory and get in his truck and wait for him. Or I could go find him in the “dryer” just to say Hi. He always had time to do that for me, his daughter. Fields of hay that will feed many a cow and horse, or pigs and sheep. Freshly mowed hay, a scent that delights the nose. And so on and so forth.   Now I know why I love the color green. How about you? What is your favorite color, and do you have any memories that go with that color?  Just a thought from me to you.    6/24/04

      God is freedom  I heard that last night at church. And it was like a shock ran through my brain. I thought of course He is. But I had never put it together like that. And I thought that would be the end of it. But the thought just kept working it’s self up to the front of my brain. I am not sure why these 3 words rocked my brain so much but it did. So I decided to do some research and see if I could figure out why.  Free or Freedom, words we hear and say so often. But when it came right down to it, did I really know what the word(s) meant. So I decided to look them up and see how the  word(s)is connected with my God. This is what I came up with.  Not imprisoned or enslaved.       To me that means when I accepted God into my heart and soul I no longer was imprisoned by the sin that rules this world. I was not longer enslaved to the ways of this world. God, through the death of His precious Son, had released me from the sin that had bound me my whole life. And with God as my Lord and Master, I will never be bound by again by sin while I am here on this earth. And there will not be any sin in Heaven. So yes according to this definition God has granted me freedom Not controlled by obligation or the will of another. That was the gift from my super smart and intelligent God. He gives me free will, whether I am saved or not. So in this respect God is freedom. He gave me free will, to chose Him or not choose Him. With this, God set His people free. He is Freedom.  Costing nothing.       God does not cost me anything. I don’t have to pay to have Him exist, He exists. And to follow Him is free; I just make the choice to do it. So who says nothing is free in this world? My God is.  To be relieved of a burden, or restraint.       God has relieved me of so many things. The need to feel I have to be perfect. In His eyes I am perfect. The need to feel accepted by people here on earth. God accepts me wherever I am at, and He is the only one I need to be accepted by. And He just does, accepts me that is. Isn’t He awesome?  The capacity to exercise choice; free will.       I have often questioned God why He allowed us free choice. I especially question Him after I hear about a horrible act some human has committed against another human. And then I realize that without free will, nothing I do means a thing. Free will makes me who I am, individual, separate, not a robot. And God in His wisdom knew this and so gave me (us) free will. Yes in this definition God is freedom.  The right to unrestricted use, full access. The right of enjoying all the privileges of membership or citizenship.        This definition is probably the one that means the most to me. Once I accepted God into my heart, and let Him be my King and Father, I get accepted into His family. I become His daughter, royalty, and a princess. I have privileges beyond imagination, because Heaven is now where I will go when I no longer cease to be in this world. And Heaven I am sure is beyond anything I can ever imagination. Yes, my God is freedom. My freedom.  There were more definitions of free and freedom. I could go on and on. But for now my mind is satisfied with the statement “God is Freedom.” Yes He is, and as one of His servants I am truly free, in every sense of the word.  Just some thoughts from me to you  6/24/04

      I just read this.  Inadequacy is a very normal feeling.  I had to take a second glance at this and digest it a 2nd time.  And a 3rd and 4th.  Inadequacy is a normal feeling?  I don’t know about this I thought.  I am the champion of feeling inadequacy.  I never felt I was good enough to do anything.  Be a mother, or a wife.  Never felt I was good enough to be a friend.  Good enough to be loved by God.  Not adequate enough to even breathe.  Not adequate to exist on this earth with other people that were adequate enough.  Ever feel that way?  Feeling not good enough made me feel like inside of me was this big dark black hole that was swallowing me up.  Which in same ways felt good, cause if I was adequate enough, I didn’t need to be here. Right?  And I felt that I was the only one, or at least one of the very few that felt that way.  Certainly JFK never felt inadequate.  Or any of the movie stars I admired.  Or the singers I loved to listen too.  I mean, they had it all, money, fame, self-esteem.  And now this line tells me they even felt inadequate at times.  Wow!  I can’t wait until the day I am in heaven and their will no longer be any need for me, or anyone else to feel inadequate.  I am sure inadequacy is a weapon of satan.  But regardless, inadequacy, mades me feel so alone.  So empty.  So nothing.  And I don’t want to feel that way anymore.  I know it is not a feeling that my God wants me to feel.  So God, will you please help me to fight the feelings of inadequacy when they arise in me?  Will you help me to replace them with you love?  Thank you Amen   Regardless if I am the only one that feels inadequate or everyone does (if I believe the above statement and I guess it could very well be true, it is not a feeling I want to continue to live with.  I know at times I may feel this feeling, a normal feeling, but at those times I want to rely on and know deep in my soul that God does not see me as inadequate.  And that is the truth I want to depend on, because it is the only real truth there is.  Just a thought from me to you. 6/23/04

      Just read this in an article.  “Happiness, if you have never had it much, can seem scary.  Even though it seems illogical to wish unhappiness on yourself, some people are uncomfortable with anything but morose, depressing days.  They almost need a problem or crisis in their life to give them a sense of purpose.”  Wow!  That is I.  And how many times have I beaten myself up for not understanding why happiness didn’t seem right to me.  How many times did I tell myself, you are happy, feel good about it.  Now I understand more why I couldn’t be happy.  Because it was strange, even abnormal to me.  I didn’t know happiness as a child, didn’t allow myself to feel happiness so when it did come my way and I was on my road to recovery, I didn’t know how to handle the emotion of happiness.  Anyone else have this experience?  The other thing about happiness, when I was a child is I couldn’t allow myself to believe in it.  It hurt, it ached to know happiness because I knew it was fleeting, only for a second.  If I allowed myself to feel that happiness, it would only help lead to my destruction when it was gone, torn away from me, ripped from my hands and heart.  I couldn’t allow myself to feel one ounce of happiness or it would destroy me when it was gone.    When I was a child I use to picture God as this being up in heaven who when He needed a laugh, would dangle a piece of happiness, love, acceptance, peace, anything that would catch my eye and heart before me.  Then when I finally had gotten worn out enough, and started to believe the happiness, love, acceptance, peace, or whatever it was, was mine, and start to believe in it and reach out to take it, that God would yank it away from my world and just laugh and laugh and laugh.  That is how I thought as a child that God got His jollies.  What a sad and tormented way for a child to live and grow up with.  What a painful way to believe.  Now as an adult I know that my idea of God as a child was not true.  The God I know now as an adult, cried with and for that child that was hurting and being destroyed piece by evil piece.  The God I know now doesn't want that pain to come to this child, to me.  He wants love and happiness and joy and peace for this child, me, just as He longs for all His children to have.  I think I like, love, want, accept this God so much better than the God I had in my childhood.  I think I will like, love, want; accept this God for the rest of my life.   Just a thought from me to you  6/23/04

      I only wanted normal things  Parents who love me, brothers who adored me  Sisters who would teach me  How to be a girl and then how to be a woman.   I wanted school memories  Full of laughter and fun  I wanted friends to trust  Friends to learn about life with.   I wanted dates full of innocence  Experiences that would live only  Warm fuzzies inside.  Memories to smile about and remember with fondness.   I wanted a husband to love with forever  And who would love me forever  Enough money to have all we needed  And maybe a little extra for a want here and there   I wanted children to love & cherish  A husband who would also be a father and a dad  I wanted them to grow up happy, secure & safe  And go out into the world with there heads held high.   I wanted my husband and I to grow old together  Thankful for our lives together  Blessed richly in all we had  Love until death do us part.   But instead I got abandonment & neglect  Loneliness & abuse and pain  Fear, fear, fear, and more  No trust, no laughter, no friends.   I got sexual abuse & rape  Innocence gone at a very young age  Divorce, drugs, drinking, sleeping around  That was how I lived.   I had my children  And I tried by best, alone  They grew up and went out on there own  But not without scars of there own.   So what comes next?    I do not know  I got what I wanted when I was little  I doubt I’ll get it now.  Vlh 4/5/04

      Can you please explain to me,  What real love is like? I mean a love that is kind, And caring, and tender? A love that builds up and does not destroy. A love that feels good and wonderful?  Can you show me please What real love is like? A love that lasts and lasts And doesn’t fall apart at the first hint of trouble? A love that is awesome and beautiful That honors both the people in love?  Can you tell me please What real love is like? Because the only love I know  Is painful and hurtful Destroys and tears apart all involved? It is made up of deceptions and turmoil And only makes you cry?  Maybe this is the real love, And the other is only for fairy tales.  Can someone please tell What real love is like?   6/22

      Why couldn’t the first time That I was with a man Be as beautiful as the storybooks Make it out to be?  Filled with love and caring Tenderness and passion? Why couldn’t I have experienced Ecstasy and orgasm, Like God intended a woman to feel.  Why instead did the first time?  With a man Be as horrendous as possible Filled with brutal force and pain  Terror and destruction Why did I have to be filled with? Horror and shame? Why couldn’t the first time  That I was with a man Be good? Because no matter how hard I try I cannot erase that first time  And allow the experiences in the now To be in the now.

      What do I see down below me?  On the bed?  I see a man on top of a girl  A girl I think I should know.  She has her eyes closed, she cannot see me  She is just lying there  While the man grunts and groans above her  I want her to look up and see me  So I can let her know she is not alone  But she will not open her eyes.  In what seems like hours but are only minutes  The man finally stiffens and then collapses on her  And suddenly I am no longer up above   I am below the man  In a body all battered and torn  Bleeding and bruised.  But in order to survive  I have to believe   That is was just some body   That was raped  Not me.  Vlh 6/22/04

      Somedays like today,  It just seems like I am living,   Only to go through the motions of living.  I get up in the morning and get dressed,  Head off to work and smile and say Hi  Only going through the motions.  I talk to people but it is not me talking  I see people but I don’t see them  I am only going through the motions.  I get home, fix some dinner  Sit in front of the TV but don’t see a thing  Just going through the motions.  I get undressed and head to bed  The events of the day running through my head  Only going through the motions.  Is this all there is to my life?  Is there nothing else to look forward too?  Or is it always going to be like this,  Just going through the motions?   6/22/04

      I am so sorry I didn’t take the time to understand you  When you were alive.  I am sorry I didn’t take the time to listen to your past  When you were alive.  I am sorry I didn’t have compassion for the rough life you had  When you were alive.  I am sorry I didn’t have more love for you  When you were alive.  I am sorry I didn’t give you more time  When you were alive.  I am sorry I didn’t have more patience for you   When you alive.   But I am thankful I was there with you during the surgery  When you were alive.  I am thankful I was there during the hospital stays  When you were alive.  I am thankful we went to Pow-wow’s   When you were alive.  I am glad we went to movies  When you were alive.  I am glad we took trips together  When you were alive.  I am glad we shared some love  When you were alive.  VLH 6/22/04

      I was never one to have lots of friends.  In fact, I don’t remember having any true friends.  I don’t have a friend I have known all my whole life that is still active in my life today.  In fact, the friends I do have that are active in my life have only been friends for less than a year.  Before that I had no one I could call a friend.  No one I could trust and talk with, met for coffee or just to talk.  I was very much alone. Growing up in a home like mine, I didn’t really care for women.  Women were the same sex as my mom, and me of course.  And my mom never had close friends.  No, my mom like men.  And I seemed to follow her.  Not that I have any close male friends in my life, but I always seemed to prefer men to women.  Women to me were back stabbers,  wanted everything you had, would not be their when you really needed them and definitly were not to be trusted. So I had no desire to make women friends, or to have them in my life.  No sir, not at all. But then, life changed, as it happens to us so much of the time.  I meant a Christian woman.  She was helping me learn about God.  From the first moment I met her, I wanted what she had.  I wanted that sense of peace that came from following a loving, kind, forgiving God.  And as I seeked out more about God I met more woman whom I came to admire, and begin to think as friends.  People I could call and chat with, or ask questions, or turn to for help.  Women I could trust. But it was all so confusing to me!  I had come to love God, and I asked for Him to enter my heart and my life.  I was working hard on looking at the world through eyes filled with God’s love, instead of eyes filled with the pain from the past.  And yet things were just not coming together in my mind.  As I got to know these women friends, sisters in Christ, they actually seemed to like me!  They said good things about me, to me!  This was not what I was use to at all. And the other part that was confusing, was I couldn’t understand why.  Why they would think good of me?  Were they blind?  Something wrong with them I didn’t know about?  I had lived with me my whole life and I knew the things they were saying about me to me, that I was beautiful, special, a blessing to them, was not true! No sir, not at all. Then one day, in his wonderful wisdom, God revealed this all to me.  He helped me to see that even thought I had been reborn in Christ, I was still seeing myself through my old eyes.  My new Christian sisters and friends were seeing me in another light.  They were seeing me as God sees me.  Or to put it another way, they were looking at me and seeing only God’s light shining through me.  They didn’t see the bad and concentrate on it, no all that mattered to them was my light.  The light of God that was in me. Since I realized this, I have been looking for the light in myself.  And I am finding it!  And I am finding I am starting to like myself more and more.  Those women, are showing me, like God, that in order to feel love you have to first receive it.  What a great way to learn something so awesome as God.  To be truly loved by another being because I am.

      When in this forsaken life, Will it be my turn? To be happy all day long To feel joy all day long To know my soul rests at ease. When in this life of pain Will it be my turn? To feel cheerful all day To have a smile on my face all day To laugh a deep belly laugh that comes from my soul. When in this life of hell Will it be my turn? To feel blessed all day long To feel wonder all day long To feel peace in my soul. When in this life I was handed Will it be my turn? To know I matter all the rest of my days To know that I count all the rest of my days To know love deep down in my soul all the rest of my days. vlh 6/21/04

      I have come to the conclusion That I really suck at this thing called life. I want to do what is right But my feelings aren’t always right and they get in the way. I never learned how to play well with others And so I always messing things up I can’t seem to fight my mind It always wants to be depressed and down Good feelings seem to bounce off my walls And never reach my heart Instead of living for today I yearn for when this life will be over So I have just come to the conclusion I suck at this thing called my life. 6/9

      What would a life without weariness look like? I would have to dream one up or imagine one – because I am sure I have never had any time in my life that I was not weary. Not that I remember anyhow. In fact, at times, like now, weariness is all I know. I wake up full of weariness. I go to sleep full of weariness. I eat, breath, work weariness. A life without it? What would there be? Sometimes I like to think back to when I was a little girl and since I have no memories of that, I like to imagine I wasn’t full of weariness back then. I like to think I thought life was fun, full of laughter and play. I like to imagine that I would wake up each morning excited to see all the new and wonderous things that were going to enter my life that day. Each night I would like to pretend when I put my head on my pillow I would drift off to a sleep filled with joy because my day had been so wonderful. I imagine I knew I was living my life to the fullest and I was loved and wanted and cherished by people here on earth.  But that is only in my imaginetion. I could have been a girl like that. Yes, I could have. But I really don’t think I was. I don’t remember for sure = no memories inside of me of if or when I was not filled with weariness. What I do remember is being born at 10 – a young girl who had to immediately  step into the role of mother to her mother. Their wasn’t time to be a little girl, full of dreams and wishes and love. The was only time to be strong and act like a adult.  So I am sure that is when the weariness set in, if it hadn’t been their before. And it made itself at home in me and it has not desire to leave. And I haven’t yet found the way to kick it out. I hope so someday as I yearn to see what life would be like without weariness.  6/10/04

      People have asked me the definition of what a self-injurer is. I will hopefully explain it in ways that someone that does not self injury gets a better understanding of what a self injurer has gone through and is going through. My hopes are that someone that doesn’t self injurer will get a better understanding of us who do, and maybe be able to find more compassion in their hearts for us. We don’t need hatred, or anger, or guilt or shame heaped on us by others. We need love and mercy and grace, just like any other person that is hurting deserves. Because we are hurting, more than we can ever let anyone know. Self injury – self harm – self abuse – self mutilation- are all the same names for what one person does to themselves. Self-injury is the deliberate harming of one’s today without the conscious intent to commit suicide. Self-injury is, along with being done too, but being done by oneself. It includes some form of physical violence to oneself. It is not an attempt to kill oneself, in most cases. It is intentional and deliberate. It is also intended to hurt one’s self only – even though others who care for you and know what you do – can get hurt in the crossfire. Self-injury is usually done in response to child abuse. A child usually blames itself for the abuse, because in order to survive, they cannot think badly of those that are caring for them. The self-injury may be a way they hurt themselves for punishment. They remember the attention they got while being harmed by their caregivers, so sometimes the self-harm reminds them of that attention again. Human children need attention, they crave attention, and if they get it because they are bad, they figure it is there fault for being bad. Or if they get no attention, they again blame themselves, thing they are not worthy of attention. They cannot and in most cases, blame the caregivers who do the harm. Self-injury maybe a symptom, or associated feature of many other kinds of disorders. A few disorders are anxiety; dissociate disorders, depression, and personality disorders. Self-injury is highly addictive, like any drug it make the person ‘high” and gives them a rush they cannot get any other way.  Anyone can and does self- injurer. Race – age – gender – education, it doesn’t matter. Self-injury is an equal opportunity employee. Most self-injurers start during adolescence, peaks during the 20’s and disappear in the 30’s. A few, like myself, don’t remember a time I was not a self-injurer in one form or another. I feel I have done it my whole life. And I unlike most other self-injures, self injured the most in my 40’s when I started therapy. There at the time, no other way for me to deal with all the emotions and memories therapy was bringing up. Many who have self-injured have histories or current problems with substance abuse, eating disorders and compulsions. They often lack the ability and skills to regulate their moods by any other methods. They also appear to have a lack of social – support systems. The act of self-injury is usually an act that one does alone, which helps lead to the isolation the self-injury feels. Also because the nature of harming one’s self is so hard for normal people to understand, it is hard for the self-injurer to talk about it with others. That leads to more isolation. I feel personally, that as bad as drinking and doing drugs are, they are more accepted in society than someone that hurts him or her. Just my thoughts though

      Dear Child:  I want you to know that when you mess up – I still love you. Please don’t think you need to feel ashamed and hide your head and run away from me when you screw up. I am not an angry God – like you were taught as a child. I do not keep score of how many times you mess up and put degrees on how bad your mistakes might be. I do not take pleasure in your pain. I do not want to strike you down, or want to cause you harm. I do not dingle good things in front of your nose, just to yak them from you when you start to believe that you are worth good things. My heart ached to know that is the kind of God you believed in for so long. You are my child. I love you no matter what. Even when you mess up, I still cherish you. I want you to share with me every detail of your life. I want you to talk to me, get angry with me if you feel the need, cry to me. I want you to be real with me. I know all this anyhow, but I want you to trust me enough to talk to me about it all. I want you to ask me for advice- it will only be answered with the knowledge of my love for you and with the knowledge I have your best interest at heart. Ask me for my opinion. I will be truthful with my answer. I will always be truthful with you – I can be nothing else. Do not be afraid to come to me with anything at anytime. Believe with all your heart that I will never forsake you – or fail you. Trust me my child. And don’t despair over how you are made. Rejoice in who you are. I made you. Unique. No one like you in the past, present or future. I made you just the way I wanted to make you. I made you to be different than everyone else. You are one of a kind – be pleased with that OK? Because I am sure pleased with the one of a kind you. Never forget I am a God of love, mercy & grace. You have always had, have now, and will have for all eternity a very special part in my heart. You are my priceless and precious child and I love you. Always and Forever You dad in Heaven  God

      Heard on the radio today. “If your mother (or anyone else for that matter), changed this very instant and became the exact thing you wanted her to be (loving, kind, attentive, like God so to speak) would that make all the past hurts and past disappoints disappear. The answer: of course not.” My thoughts on this What has happened cannot be undone. What has been said cannot be unsaid. The hurts and disappointments will always be there. They may subside in time, they may become less hurtful, they might get buried and stuffed, they might even get forgiven, but they will always remain in my mind – somewhere. So what do I do with it? I turn to my true and faithful Father, who is also my mother, best friend, who can help me deal with all this. God will always be they’re for me, and He is always willing to listen and help me work through all my hurts and pains disappoint and sorrows. He has my best interest at heart. His timing may not be my timing, but if I trust in Him, in time in can use those hurts for good. He always cares for me and will love me. He will always have time to listen to me. God loved me first. I need to accept that truth as the truth it is. I can accept love from others, see my God reflection in there eyes. They can give me some of the love I missed as a child, and give me some of the affirmations I need to hear that I never got as a child. They can’t erase those losses, but I can accept their love, sit back and bask in it and accept it as the truth. Just like I can with God’s love.

      I cane from an abuse home. A home full of abandonment and neglect. A home where I felt I was only an empty shell. I cut sometimes because I didn’t’ know what to do with the pain. I didn’t know at the time that it was going to be as powerful, as addicting as any drug. I just knew sometimes I craved hurting myself just like an addict craves for a fix, and when I fulfilled the craving I received an intense high like no other.  I don’t know if this information has helped me or not. I guess it has, as I know now why it is so hard to break the habit of self-injury. It helps me to understand and not beat myself up when I slip. And I know now how stopping is going to be a long uphill battle. I have to want to stop self-injury for one. For myself. I also need  God in order to do this. I do not have the strength or power to do it on my own. If possible also there is finding a friend to hold me accountable for slips. Being totally real with this friend, and knowing I will have to tell them if I slip will really help deter me I think. I know I want to kick this habit – I know I don’t want it to control me another minute. Dear Lord: I know self-injury is an addiction. I know it is harmful to me in several way – but especially because it reinforces my feelings of hatred towards myself. Lord I admit I am powerless to stop. I admit I need you to help me stop. Lord I know you want me to stop. I know you will not hate me if I slip. I know you will help me and give me strength. Thank you Lord for your help. Thank you for your love for me. Thank you for your love and mercy and grace. Amen.

      I still think about anger some Lord. I mean I should have anger shouldn’t I? I mean after all the crap that has happened some anger ought to be around, right? And yet I don’t know how to get in touch with it. I know I’ve asked you for help Lord _ I have surrounded it to you – I just worry about what Kevin will say. Do I have it so buried Lord I can’t unlock it? I think I do. But it is not up to me to unlock it – is it Lord? I have given that to you. I just wish I knew if you were going to do anything about it Lord. Any idea? I know you are there Lord. I know it. Just sometimes I can’t feel you. I know that happens Lord. But it is scary. Real scary. I feel so lost and so alone. And I don’t like that feeling anymore Lord. Can you at least say Hi? Maybe you are and I don’t sense it. I just don’t know.  Amen

      Am I wasting my time Lord When I get stuck on something And my mind twirls around and around Turns it this way and that way Upside down and inside out Sideways and backwards  Until I feel I am going crazy With no solution in sight?  Then after a few days I find myself in your prescence  Somehow   Someway   Somewhere And all the thinking no longer exists Because I become so focused on you That is all I can see.  Sometimes at that point all the thinking Seems to finally make sense And even though the answer may not appear  I know through you it will work out OK   And I will find peace in you.  Was I wasting my time?  3/7/04

      What would that look like to me?       So Lord, if you were to restore those years the locusts destroyed in my lifetime, what would that mean to me?      Would you make me a writer, who helps those in need with her words?       Would you give me enough money, I could go to therapy everyday and get well sooner than later?       Would you give me enough money so I could quit my job and spend my days learning about you and glorifying your word and ways?       Will you save my husband so the two of us can worship you together?       Will you save the boys and my daughter in law  so we can be the family you always wanted us to be?       Will you reunite me with my brothers and my niece?       Will you help me conquer my addiction so everyone I met won’t be a danger and I can trust and love and leave it at that?         Will you make the fantasies stop all of them – except for the ones for my husband.  And will you make my relationship my husband become one full of intimacy and a love making so sweet so tender so mind blowing, like I have never experienced before?       Will you grant me peace?       Will you make me well so no more medicines I will need to take? 	        Will you make me pretty?        Will you make me a singer with a super voice?  And give me a talent for drums and playing the guitar.  And the grace to be able to dance out the feelings I have in my heart for you?        Will you make me see myself as a blessing to others with no more doubts in my mind about it?       Will you make me see myself as worthy.       Will you let me travel to all 48 states and Ireland and Australlia too.  Will you let me walk the lands where Jesus also walked?      Will you let me became very involved with Rachel;s Vineyard?       Will you let the Holy Spirit come upon me so I can join a prayer team and reach out to others during ministry time?       Will you help me start a women’s group where women who are hurting come and feel safe enough to talk about anything and be loved and accepted for themselves?        Give me a way to forget who I am and start anew with only you in my soul with lots of love there for others also.    A way to face each day with joy in my soul and laughter in my heart.  TO not be terrified of the next second.  To want to live fully and completely  not letting fear rule me but letting love rule me.      Good health and a good life with you in his heart for Baby Josh.     A way for me to stop the past from destroying my future.  A way to stop the past from consuming my mind.      From this moment forward to not allow me to live another moment in the past.    Make everyday of my life fun.     To be able to express anger emotions appropriately and accept anger that is directed at me appropriately.      TO know who I am sexually – be able to express it – and to be able to trust myself in a appropriately sexual manner.      To be able to express hurt feelings when I feel them without turning them inward.      To be able to talk to people in a large or small crowd and not to feel like I a misfit.      To be able to laugh at myself.      Bring the little girl that I know is still inside out into the woman I am today.      To stop cutting for GOOD!

      This was emailed to me and I couldn't resist putting it here.       This is one of the most interesting things I have heard in a while. Hope you think so too.  For all the scientists out there, and for all the students who have a hard time convincing these people regarding the truth of the Bible, here's something that shows God's awesome creation, and that He is still in control.    Did you know that the space program is busy proving that what has been called "myth" in the Bible is true?  Mr. Harold Hill, President of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore, Maryland, and a consultant in the space program, relates the following development.    I think one of the most amazing things that God has done for us today happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at GreenBelt, Maryland. They were checking out where the positions of the sun, moon, and planets would be 100 years and 1,000 years from now. We have to know this so we won't send up a satellite and have it bump into something later on in its orbits. We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the satellite and where the planets will be so the whole thing will not bog down.    They ran the computer measurement back and forth over the centuries, and it came to a halt. The computer stopped and put up a red signal, which meant that there was something wrong with either the information fed into it or with the results as compared to the standards. They called in the service department to check it out, and they said, “What's wrong?" Well, they found there is a day missing in space in lapsed time. They scratched their heads and tore their hair. There was no answer.    Finally a Christian man on the team said, 'You know, one time I was in Sunday School, and they talked about the sun standing still.' While they didn't believe him, they didn't have an answer either, so they said, 'Show us.' He got a Bible and went to the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with 'common sense.' There they found the Lord saying to Joshua, 'Fear them not,  I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before  thee.' Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the enemy, and if darkness fell, they would overpower them. So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still! That's right... 'The sun stood still and the moon stayed and lasted not to go down about a whole day!' (Joshua 10:12-13) The astronauts and scientists said, 'There is the missing day!'    They checked the computers going back into the time it was written and found it was close but not  close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua's day was 23 hours and 20 minutes ... not a whole day. They read the Bible, and there it was  'about (approximately) a day.' These little words in the Bible are important, but they were still in trouble because if you cannot account for 40 minutes, you'll still be in trouble 1,000 years from now. Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits.    As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible where it said the sun went BACKWARDS. The scientists told him he was out of his mind, but they got out the "Book" and read these words in 2 Kings that told of the following story: Hezekiah, on his death bed, was visited by the prophet Isaiah who told him that he was not going to die. Hezekiah asked for a sign as proof.  Isaiah said 'Do you want the sun to go ahead 10 degrees?' Hezekiah said, 'It is nothing for the sun to go ahead 10 degrees, but let the shadow return backward 10 degrees. Isaiah spoke to the Lord, and the Lord brought the shadow ten degrees BACKWARD!  Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes!     Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the universe!"

           I have a depressive personality.  I don’t know if there is such a thing, but that is how I see myself.  I look back over my life and all I see is depression.  Oh, there might be a moment of light here and there, or a moment of laughter every once in a while, but for the most part – I see depression.  It is like a dear friend that has comforted me when things get rough.  It is a part of me - it is what I am.  So I can’t really hate depression, can I?  Because then I would be hating myself.        I have tried different things to not be depressed. Because even if it was a part of me, everyone likes a little change don’t they?  And I knew others didn’t live like I did, and I was hoping, just hoping, I could find something that could change the depression and make me like others.  I tried reading.  Music.  Movies.  Drugs.  Drinking.  Sex.  Gambling.  Therapy.  Prescription drugs.  Self-harm.  For the most part they work they would work.  But only for a short time.  Then the depression would come crashing in again.  And I really think that kind of depression is harder to take. After a moment or two of happiness things would seem darker and harder to fight against.  For a moment, with the help of all the things listed above, I had hope. Then the hope was snatched away and now not only did I have the depression to deal with, but now I had the lost of something I had hoped would help bring the light into my life.         But now I think I have found something that will help change my depressive personality.  I am pretty sure it will help.  So far the hope I have discovered with this, is still alive and well. It hasn’t been snatched away.  And I don’t think it.  This hope is real. It is out there. Or maybe, it was really inside me all along.  I just couldn’t see it through all the murk and mud the depression left behind.       It is not an instant cure.  It is not a magic cure. It hasn’t destroyed the depression with one mighty blow.  It hasn’t even taken the depression completely away. It has started to work on it however. Now even in the darkest deepest moments of my depression, I can see a pin light that keeps the hope alive.  It is the pin light of love.  It is the pin light of my God.        Oh, I was one of those people that would laugh and sneer at people that said God was the answer.  I use to think those kind of people were weak.  Not strong enough to stand on there own.  Not able enough to care for themselves own.  They needed something to lean on.  They weren’t man enough, or women enough to handle life on there own power.  I figured I was enough to handle life.  Even if that life was not good, I was doing it on my own.  And that was what use to matter to me. I didn’t need or want God.          Now I find myself one of those “people”.  And very proud of it.  God has given me more than I could have ever imagined.  He has shown me mercy.  He has given me grace.  Forgiveness- I ask for and He willingly gives it to me.  His love is there for me – whether I accept it or not.  Whether I want it or not.  God loves me just as I am.  He loves me no matter what I have done and no matter what I may do in the future. It is an unconditional love, like I have never experienced in my whole life.  And it is free for the taking.  I can’t earn it.  I can only choose to accept it or reject it.         Early in my walk to Christ I heard a couple of things that helped turn me to God with open arms and flame the hope even higher.  One was that “truth is the truth, whether you believe it or not”.  And God is truth!  Whether or not I choose to believe it, that fact remains.  And you know, I am now choosing to believe it.  A truth I know deep down in my soul is really true.      The other thing I learned was “If I had been the only person on earth – Jesus would still have willingly gone to the cross for me.”  Just for me!  What love!  What sacrifice!   There are very few people I know I would willingly die for.  My kids.  My spouse. Maybe even my parents.  But Jesus did more than lay down His life for me.  He died horribly, hung on a cross for all to see and jeer and laugh at.  He suffered humiliation, and unbelievable pain, and shame, and hatred and betrayal, and so much more.  And He willingly knew this was going to happen to Him, and still He walked to it.  Wow!  And it would have been just for me if I was the only person on this earth.  And He did it for me, so I could enjoy a personnel relationship with God without sin getting in the way of our relationship and putting up a wall that couldn’t be breached.  And another thing.  He didn’t do it for Himself, He did it for me.  For all of us.  He suffered for us.  If that isn’t true love I don’t know what is.  If that isn’t truth, I don’t know what truth is.  Whether I decide to believe in it or not.  Thank you Jesus for so willingly giving up your life for me.  So I will have the kind of relationship with God I was intended to have, and so I might spend eternity in heaven with You and Him. Thank you for my life, and thank you for the life I will have after my death.  You are the truth and the way, and I willingly choose to follow you wherever you lead me.  Amen     1/19/04

      According to pollster George Gallup Jr., “American revert the Bible, but – by and large, then don’t read it.”  As a result many don’t know what it says.  God is not hiding, nor He is eluding us.  In fact, the Bible states that God is actively pursuing a relationship with each and every person.  So, how does one go about seeking this God that is pursuing us?  Just like you would anything else you are seeking.  You read up on it, you seek out others that know the subject and spend time with them, and you pray to God.  You need to make God a priority in life; read the Bible, trust Him, have faith in Him, talk to Him, and spend time with Him.  When we pay attention, we will discover His activity in our lives is unmistakable.    As we study the Bible we learn many great and wonderful things.  We also learn some not so wonderful things.  We learn about sin.  Sin means – you have missed the mark.  Sin also means to defy God’s way and seek our own ways to please ourselves.  Sin, however is just not only a behavior.  It is also thought and attitudes that contradict God’s expectations for us.  Sin always separates us from God’s love and glory.  Sin can be little or big, schuttle or dramatic.  No matter what shape it is in, sin is still sin.  And it sure makes our relationship with God very hard.       So how do we break the barrier of sin and fully get to experience God’s love, mercy, and love for us?   We do this by believing in Jesus Christ and by repenting of our sins and asking for God’s forgiveness.  Sound like a big order?  It really isn’t.  Only takes a second or two and the chains of suffering around your soul can be shattered in an instant.

      O Lord God of my salvation I cry out to you every minute of everyday Please bend your ear down to me and hear my prayer Listen deeply to the cries of my soul.  Am soul is full of troubles And bent down from the strain Adrift among the dead I feel Where I feel I belong.  I am alive but lying in a grave of my own making, In deep darkness alone and numb I am shut up inside myself With no strength to find my way out.  Lord, can you work wonders for the dead like me? Can your love, mercy and grace find it’s way into my hole? Can you bring your wonders to my grave? And light my way back to life and You?  2/16/04

         Dear God:  I have no strength in me to fight this black cloud that is hanging over my head.  I want to find a deep dark hole somewhere, where I can crawl into and curl up and sleep, and sleep, and sleep.  Somewhere where I can be alone.  Alone in my misery.  Is there such a place Lord?  I want somewhere  where I don’t have to think, feel, be.  I tired of fighting Lord.  I fight to survive in this crazy mixed up world I don’t belong in.  Fighting to make things work here for me.  Fighting to be nice to others, without resentment, or envy or judgment.  All I want Lord is some rest.  Rest from people, my work, the world, myself.  Peace to come to my heart, my soul, my mind.  That is what I am longing for.  Is it out there?  Is it even possible?        Sometimes Lord, I can feel you and hope comes filling me up and gushing over.  And with you there I feel happy, on top of the world, able to conquer all.  But then that feeling leaves and I am left alone.  But I am not really alone, am I God?  You are there.  Even in my dark hole you are there.  In my misery you are there.  In my hope and my joy you are there.  Even when I feel so alone with the weariness of soul threatening to overwhelm me, you are there.  Thank you Lord for being there.  Thank you for always being there.  Thank you for being my God.  2/16/2004

      I don’t know where I am going, However I do know where I have been.  I’m going to keep searching for the answers And looking for the truth. Hoping someday my heart will be rescued From the pain I can’t let go of.  Are you the one to give me the answers Lord? Are you the one to give me the truth God? Are you the one to rescue my heart Jesus?  I wonder if there is a reason I was born to so much suffering I wonder if there is a purpose For this life I have been given.  Are you the one to show me the reasons Lord? Are you the one to give me a purpose God? Are you the one to ease my suffering Lord?  The bible says you are the one to Guide me Lord, The bible says you will the one who has always loved me God The bible says you sacrificed your life for me Jesus.  If that is true then I have my answers, my truth My heart will be rescued, and the pain will disappear. There is a reason for my suffering, There is a purpose to my life. I found it all in my Lord, My God, My Jesus. Amen   1/27/04

            Sometimes life gets really discouraging.  Sometimes life seems to be a endless tragic treadmill, where life seems like it isn’t worth living any longer.  Sometimes you feel life holds nothing for you, except pain, heartache, soul ache, loneliness, fear, shame, guilt, you know what I mean.  You feel no one loves you or even cares for you.  You feel like nothing good is in your life or will ever come into your life.  And you know these feelings are going to last the rest of your life.  And even if you are lucky enough that they go away for a little while, they will return.    You are depressed.       I would like to tell you that when you are in the midst of your despair, when are surrounded by doubts, when frustration and hopelessness are overwhelming, that hope is not gone forever.  No matter how it feels, it is still there.  I want and pray that you will come to see that at these dark times – Jesus Christ has a new view of life to offer to you.  It is a view that is truly beautiful.  Jesus said “I have come that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10)  What HE was saying, “I came so Vicki/(or your name) can have a life filled with joy, happiness and love.  And not only will this joy, happiness and love last our lifetimes, it will extend through eternity.       God made us in His image the Bible says.  You can be sure that if God made us like Himself, then our lives must have tremendous meaning, a awesome destiny, and a purpose for all of it.     Jesus came to give us a good life.  A good life here on earth.  A abundant life right here on the face of this earth.  Life does have many beautiful moments that God wants us to enjoy & cherish.  It is the truth.

            Dear God:  Could I please crawl up on your lap please?  Could you hold me and rock me and whisper that everything is going to make me be all right?  Can you make me feel safe?  My spirit is dragging in the dirt Lord. And I am so tired.  I just want to feel some peace Lord-I want the rest only your presence can give to me.  My soul is hiding in a deep dark hole, scared of the pain and fear that is surrounding me.  I know you can give me the serenity I need so badly right now Lord-I know it in my mind anyhow-my heart just can’t see it or feel it right now.  I am engulfed with sadness, despair and a loniness that threats my very being.  I don’t want to win Lord-I want your light to shine once again in my world.  I know that is the illness of bipolar making me feel this way, and deep down I know it won’t last.  But even those facts don’t make it any less scary or hard to handle right now at this moment.  So Lord, if you could just let me sit a little while in your arms, I will start the long journey up to become whole again.  Thank you Lord.  Your servant    Amen  1/21/04

Amos 4:13 A-All you have to do is accept His gift of salvation that was offered through the blood of Jesus M-Make a joyful noise to the Lord O-O’Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth S-Sends His angels to care for you  For the day of the Lord upon all the nations is near; as you have done, it shall be done to you; Your reprisal shall return upon your own head. Obadiah 1:16  O-Obey God rather than man  B-Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven A-Am I seeking the glory of man or the Glory of God? D-Different He made us all, and yet the same He made us I-It is good to give thanks to the Lord A-And in His work I get hope H-His fingerprints are all over me  When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord, and my prayer went up to You, into Your Holy Temple.  Jonah 2:7 J-Jesus said “I am the resurrection and the life.” O-Oh God, teach me your ways and show me you paths N-No evil will befall you for He is with you A-As much as you want to see Him, He wants to see you more H-How great are His signs  He will again have compassion on us, and will subdue our iniquities.  You will cast all our sins into the sea.

      Self Harm Self-harm facts and figures   As many as 1 out of 10 teenagers may harm themselves More girls than boys – 7:1 female: male ratio There are around 142,000 hospitals admissions each year due to self-harm in England. 1 in 10 adolescents who have harmed themselves will do so more than once. Adolescents who self-harm are more at risk of developing “mental disorders” and “personality disturbances” in later life. 74% of women who self-injure start during childhood 69% of women who self-injure have been doing so for at least 5 years Estimation is 2 million people in the US engage in some form of self-harm 50% of all people that self-harm have a history of sexual or physical abuse. 90% grew up in homes where communication between parents and child was lacking and where messy problems were ignored, avoided, and ultimately left in silence. Estimated ½ to 2/3 of people that self-harm also have eating disorders. Self-harm can be a symptom of several psychiatric illness: Personality Disorders; Bipolar Disorder; Major Depression; Anxiety Disorders; as well as psychoses such as Schizophrenia.   What is self-harm? Self-harm is just that, self-harm to one’s self.  You do it on purpose, deliberately, impulsive, repetitive, as a non-lethal harming of one’s body. It can be done many ways.  Cutting, scratching, biting, burning, scratching, overdoses, pulling hair out, skin picking, self-hitting or punching objects, infecting oneself, bone breaking, picking scabs, some tattoo’s, and never letting sores/wounds to heal, as well as other various forms of bodily harm are was to self-harm. Many who self-harm use multiple methods to do the self-harm.  People that self-harm may attempt to conceal the resultant scarring with clothing, and if discovered, often make excuses as to how the injury happened.  A significant number are also struggling with eating disorders and alcohol or substance abuse problems. The majority starts in adolescence and can do it once or twice, or continue on throughout their lifetime. It can be done anywhere on the body, and leaves scars on the outside as well as deep scars on the inside.  It is not for attention.  It is a way to relieve the bad feelings you feel inside and it can also be done to punish yourself. The pain is a good way to make up for any evil you feel you have done.  Any negative feelings can be let out with the pain you cause yourself.  When you don’t know how to express the feelings inside, the scars can tell the story all on its own.  It can be about the control.  After all you control, when and where and how you hurt yourself.  When you world is out of control, this self-harming can put you back in to control.  It is usually not about dying.  Rather it is about living and existing in a hell that you can’t exist in any other way.  It is about staying alive.         Many cutters simply lack the language skills to express their emotions.  Instead they feel only self-loathing, alienation, (and other emotions) that cause them to believe that self-harm is the only way to deal with the emotions. People that self-harm would rather feel the physical pain than feel or look at or deal with the emotional pain inside.       People that self-harm come from all races and social classes.  What they have in common is that they are often children of divorce.  They also turn to self-harm to avoid feelings of worthlessness, numbness, and detachment.  They come to appreciate the raw pain of injury; finally, they can feel something.  And feeling physical pain is better than not feeling anything at all.            Self-harm is very habit forming.  It becomes as addictive as any drug can be.  And it can be just as damaging.  From the first moment you do self-harm, you can very easily get hooked on the quick release of emotions locked inside you, and/or the exhilaration  harming yourself gives you. But like any other drug, the relief is temporary, and a self-destructive cycle often develops without proper treatment. To someone that has never self-harmed this may seem sick or morbid.  But for those of us that do self-harm, there is no experience quite like it.  For me cutting could make me feel alive.  The numbness inside was so overwhelming I thought I was dead.  The pain from the self-harm helped me to realize in reality I was alive to some extent.  Later the blood became an added addition to the self-harm.  As time went by, I came to the conclusion more and more, that I did not fit on this earth, that I was not like anyone else here.  The blood letting proved to me that yes, in this one respect I was like other humans.  All humans bleed the same red blood.  So I must belong to the human race even a little bit then, right?       Dangers.  People that self-harm often become desperate about their lack of self-control and the addictive-like nature of their acts, which may lead them to true suicide attempts.  The self-injure behaviors may also cause more harm than intended, which could result in medical complications or death.  Eating disorders and alcohol or substance abuse intensify the threats to the individual’s overall health and quality of life.        Treatment.  Self-injury treatment options include outpatient therapy, partial (6-12 hours a day) and inpatient hospitalization.  When the behaviors interfere with daily living, such as employment, school and relationships, and or are health or life threatening, a specialized self- injury hospital program with experienced staff is recommended.  The effective treatment of self-harm is often a combination of medication, cognitive/behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, supplemented by other treatment services as needed.  Medication is often useful in the management of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and the racing thoughts that may accompany self-harm.  Cognitive/behavioral therapy that incorporates contracts, journals, and behavioral logs are useful tools for regaining self-control.  Interpersonal therapy assist individuals in gaining insight and skills for the development and maintenance of relationships, and helps individuals understand their destructive thoughts and behaviors.  Services for eating disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, trauma abuse, and family therapy should be readily available and integrated into treatment, depending on individual needs.  Helping those that Self-harm Tough love approach – don’t focus on wounds but the reason and feelings behind the wounds Help them to identify there feelings Listen to there stories, with love, and without judging Help them to learn how to put a thought between the impulse and the action Suggest journaling to relieve there feelings Pray for them if they will allow you too  If you suspect someone of being a self-harmer Don’t ignore it Be direct but empathic React in a caring way by saying something like “I’ve noticed scrathes (scars) on your body.  Did you make them?  I’m worried about you and want to help you get help.   Don’t minimize their seriouness (wounds, scars) thinking that the whole think is just a harmless fad and the wounds will heal with time.  Self-harm is a way of telling people something is wrong.  Self-harmers need to learn how to talk about what is wrong – not resort to hurting themselves.            Alternatives to Self – Harm Drawing on where you want to cut in red pen Press ice cubes to the skin Wear plasters over where you want to cut Read a good book Play loud music Scream into your pillow Hit a cushion Play a computer game Watch TV/a video Go for a long walk Pray Get out of the house, like maybe a mall, somewhere to be around others Call a friend  Go into a chat room Kick/hit a ball against the wall Throw rocks as hard as you can Scream Hug your favorite stuffed animal This is only a start.  Use your imagination.  Note to people that self-harm      What could I tell you to help you see that I do understand why you are hurting yourself?  I have been there myself.  Over and Over and Over again.  I have the scars to prove I am just like you.  Scars I keep hidden because you can’t explain to others why you cut yourself.  You can’t explain so they could possibly understand and not think you are completely nuts.  Only someone that does it can understand.   Out of all the things that have happened to me in my lifetime, and out of all the things that I have done in my lifetime, this is the one thing about myself I still keep hidden from others.  I just don’t know the words that would explain to them why cutting myself is what I needed to do to myself at different times in my life to just survive.  How do you explain that sometimes you get so numb you can’t feel anything so you cut yourself so the pain will bring you back into this reality and you know if you can feel pain you must still be alive.  And also for me, when I see the dark red blood running out of me, I know that I am a human being because all humans have red blood.  So I do connect with the world in a small little way.      I can’t imagine ever sitting down or a cup of tea with a friend or loved one who doesn’t self-mutilate and say, “Yea last night my life was so out of control I cut myself to feel some sense of control.  What to see my cut?”  Yea that would really make for good conversation.  You can talk about sexual abuse, mental abuse, other kinds of pain, and most people can relate.  But you talk about a pain so deep and dark inside you have to cut yourself to feel some relief- well I know you know why you can’t talk to just anyone about this.      And with the secret ness comes the isolation the aloneness the feeling that you are the only one that does this, no one could possibly ever understand.  That makes it ever worse and sometimes you hurt yourself to even get past these thoughts.  But you know what – I do understand.  I have done the same thing over and over again most of my life.     I guess what I am trying to say is, you are not alone.  And if you ever feel you are ready to talk to someone that will totally understand, please, please give me a call.  It will not only be helping you, but you will also be helping me.

       I want to find a God that will bring about my healing and know that He will be the one with the power to change me.  I want a God that will bring me freedom and acceptance.  I want a God I can speak to me about my pain and my issues knowing He will listen and that He really cares.  I want a God that can breath life into the dry and dead areas of my heart and make them fruitful and alive.  I want a Holy Spirit that will be my comforter, and someone I know I can depend on to be there, even when others in my life fail me.  I want a God that is gentle and encouraging.   I think I have found that God that does all this and more.  I think He was always with me.  I am so glad that I finally looked up and inside and found Him.     Most people including myself, struggle with these 3 questions about life.  “Why am I alive?”  “Does my life really matter?” “Do I have a real purpose on this earth?”  I feel the answer to these 3 questions and many more questions are found in the understanding of God’s word and His will for me.      God’s purpose for my is greater than my happiness at this moment, my own personal fulfillment even my peace of mind.  It will last longer than my family, my job, my wildest dreams, my wildest ambitions and even my life here on earth.  If I only follow God’s works and His will, I will learn why I am here.  I was born by His purpose and for His purpose.       If I really want to find my purpose in life, I need to not look in God and His word; I need to stop looking in all the wrong places.  I have spent many many many years, looking for my purpose in other people and others things.  I always thought if I only had this guy or this house or this job I would be happy and have a purpose.  I asked self-centered questions like “What are my goals?” or “What are my dreams?”  or “What do I want out of my life?”  Now with God in my life, I know I have to stop focusing on myself and instead focus on Him.  After all, I didn’t create myself.  So how do I know what I was created for?  My focus must now start with God, my Lord, my Creator.  I must exist and live because God wants me to exist and live in His ways and His love.  Life will never make sense until I know in every fiber of my being that I was made God and for His purposes.    Being rich and famous, or beautiful and talented will not make me happy or content.  Only in God will I discover the answer to what is my identity, my purpose, and my significance.  Any other road will lead to a dead end and death.  In God I must trust and in Him I will find the answers.               I am hoping God can and will help me with my bad habit of always worrying.  If I don’t have anything to worry about, I will make something else because I am so comfortable about worrying, I can’t stand myself.  I know worry is an expensive habit: it splits my energy between today and tomorrow.  I pray God can help over it.  I know I carry around a bag full of worries.  Like “if only this, what if that”.  Sometimes the weight of the bag doubles me over, but let go of it I cannot seem to do.  Sometimes I get irritating of carrying my bag full of worries but I can’t put it down and no one else seems to want it either.  Everyone seems to have there own bag.  Even if I had all the money in the world, I doubt I could even pay someone to carry my bag of worries.    Of course I don’t blame them.  Worries split my mind.  Half of mind is on the now, and the other half is on what is not here yet.  And that is not a good way to live.       And another thing to think about regarding worry.  Worrying is not a disease in itself, but it can sure cause a lot of diseases to appear in your body and mind.  Stomach problems seem to be the main ones.  But there are others I am sure.  Worrying is an expensive habit in more ways than one.  And you know what?  Worrying doesn’t even work!  Worry has never brightened a day, gave you money, or made your life easier.  In fact it does the opposite.  Jesus said:  “which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?”  Matthew 6:27          So what do I do?  With help from my Lord and His words like, “He restoreth my soul,” I can overcome this horrible habit of worrying.  He is more than willing to take all my worries.  He can make my soul at peace.  He can me.  God is my Father; He is there when I want Him and even when I am too busy or forgetful to remember Him.  He will place Himself between me and my worries.  At His perfect timing.  God will lead me; all I have to do is let Him.  He will do the right thing at the right time.  And that makes all the difference in the world to me.     Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things.  Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.  Matthew 6:34       I think the key is this.  Meet today’s problems with today’s strength.  Don’t take on tomorrow’s worries until tomorrow.  Who knows maybe by tomorrow the worries will solve themselves.  But even if they don’t, it doesn’t matter, because they are tomorrow’s worries, and God is going to help me take care of today’s first.  If I just allow Him to that is.             Helen Keller was deaf and mute from about the age of 18 months.  When Annie Sullivan finally got through to her and taught her how to communicate, she told Helen about God.  Helen said to her, “Is that His name?  I’ve been talking to Him all my life.”  Here was girl that could communicate with anyone, she was too young to remember anything about God (if anyone had told her) before she got sick and lost her sight and hearing.  God put that desire in Helen to seek Him out.  He put that same desire in all of us.  We may not know what we are seeking, but we do we are seeking.  For me it was seeking something to fill that hole in my soul I have always felt.  Seeking something that would never let me down, love me as I am, be there for me always, and never change.  I know I have found that and more in God.         I heard this today, and even though it really doesn’t have anything to do with what I am researching here, I want to write it down because it really hit a cord with me.  “Changing partners is like changing troops, you still carry all your dead caresses with you.”  And that use to be so true in my life.  No matter how much I changed, moving, husbands, jobs, I still had me.  Changing things, including partners did not help for long at all.  I wonder now though, if God comes into my life, will He take those dead caresses from me?  I think He can.  I hope He can.  I will believe He can.        Grace.  Such a simple 5-letter word.  One you hear a lot about.  But have I ever really taken time to think about the word?  I know it has lots of meaning behind it.  There is a great book I have read, “What’s so amazing about Grace?” by Philip Yancy.  Now I am thinking I need to spend some time thinking about this simple word.  I don’t know if I could tell you what I thought the meaning of grace was until I started all this.  I know when I heard the word “grace” it brought a nice warm feeling into my soul.  Some words are like that.  Hope, Faith, Love, Joy, name a few.  But to the real meaning of grace I have no clue.  I am not sure of the meaning in the dictionary, or the meaning that God applies to it.  I did however find this in the book, “Grace means there is nothing we can do to make love us more – and grace also means there I nothing we can do to make God love us less.”  Nothing I can do?  What a very odd concept.  I can’t be prettier, smarter, more giving, meaner, more selfish?  God just loves me as I am no matter what.  Wow.  That is really a powerful grouping of words.  I don’t have to do anything to be loved by God.  He just loves me!  No matter how many mistakes I make, no matter how special I am, no matter how much I screw things up, no matter how many great things I do, God will love me the same at this moment as He has in the past and as He will in the future.  I don’t have to win His love.  It is a gift from Him.  All I have to do is accept it and let it in.          So why do I want to screw up?  I don’t.  Why hurt God with the evil things I do?  I don’t want to.  I always wondered before I started this, why if God forgive you for everything why didn’t that give you a free license to hurt and destroy and stomp on others.  God would forgive you.  But now I think I finally get it.  If God is in your heart, you have no desire to go do things like that.  It isn’t about forgiveness.  It is more about loving your God and not wanting to do things you know He would not approve of.  It means I have the freedom to choose to do things that will make God smile, or I can choose to do things that will make God sad.  If I love God, why would I purposely go out and do bad things because I know in His grace He will forgive me.  I don’t know if this would make sense to anyone else.   But it makes all the sense in the world to me.  I want to make my God smile.  So please God, help me to walk in your path.  I can’t do it alone; I need you to guide me.  Thank you. Amen          I can’t imagine going through life without the need, the urge, and the desire to please someone else.  Not to do well, but to do it for survival or so they will love you.  There is a difference I am starting to learn.  I can’t imagine going through one day without thinking of what I could do to please this person, or what I can do to please that person.  Not to sound conceited but it should be enough that I am in there life.  I shouldn’t have to prove my worth to them all the time.  That seems to wear me out.  Like pretending I am someone else so they will like me or stay with or be my friend.  That takes so much energy.  I have to realize that I am who I am and God made me that way.  I shouldn’t feel I have to look right, or say the right things or do the right things to fit in on this earth.  I shouldn’t look so much for approval from others.  I should get approval, especially from myself, just because I am me, just like others should approve of themselves just because they are who they are.  We are all children of God; we should treat each other as such.  Maybe that is what I need to strive for.  If I can learn this, which I think is a meaning of grace, than maybe some of the other troubles I come across will be lessened in some small way.  And maybe I can see myself as a little more as a child of God, loved for who I am not for what I do.           God also gives every human being the gift of a conscience.  We are born with it.  Definition:  A knowledge or sense of right and wrong, with a compulsion to do right; moral judgment that opposes the violation of a previously recognized ethical principle that leads to feelings of guilt.              I feel that when I ignore my conscience too much, eventually it will be quenched.  Little by little, when people ignore their consciences over time, small things of evil will soon stop bothering them.  Then before they know it, large horrible things of evil will not even bother them.  There hearts will then become ugly and black.       It still shocks me when I hear when man has done a horribly evil act against another human and they did it with no remorse.  When the conscience is seared, burned out, by going against its nudging-men become worse than animals with there behavior.

         I think that the reason why it’s so hard to try and ignore something negative that your parents say is because you as a child love them so much!  All you want them to do is love you back, to be proud of you, to care about you.  I mean if you can’t depend on your own family to help you when things get you down, whom can you depend on?  One of the Ten Commandments is Honor thy Father and thy Mother.  How can I do that when they have hurt me so bad?  If I break a commandment is God going to never be there for me?  Is that what I am doing wrong, the reason God and I can’t seem to get together?         It is unthinkable to believe that our actions have no merit that God would not look favorably upon those who sacrifice their own well being for the cause of another.  Herein is the dividing line between those who know God and those who know of God.  It is also because of this line by which the scripture is leant weight.  For those who know God, the scriptures are the weight by which all things are measured.   For those who do not know God, the scriptures are not enough.  Why?  Because if eliminates the need for investigation, for seeking.  I do not need to look anywhere else for the answers to God’s mystery if the scriptures alone are sufficient.  The truth be known, Jesus is the Son of God, rose from the dead and is alive, and that it is necessary to have faith in His atonement for our redemption – because we need redeeming.        Am I like so many other people on this earth that only seek God for there own self-actualization?  If I am, like them, I will fail.  I am not suppose to use God for my own purposes, God is suppose to use me for His.  He put us here so we can call on Him when we need Him.  Well Lord I am calling.         Even if my life had gone perfect, even if I had reached all my personal goals, even if I had been a big success, that would not have filled that hole in my soul.  Finding success on this earth is not the purpose God put me here for?        There are two options to find out why we were put here.  The first is by guessing.  A lot of people do that.  They theorize, they conjecture.  The second is really the only true answer.  It’s revelation.  It is finding our purpose here using God’s word, The Bible.  The best ways to find out what the purpose of an invention is ask the Creator of it, the designer.  So if you want to know why you are here, ask God.  Pretty simple really.          I think it is only logical to say that something must have created the first speck of the first planet..the first breath of air, the first sun and moon.  And the person I consider made all this is God. I rejoice that the Holy Spirit indwells me both and the He is perfectly willing and capable of guiding me on an individual basis to most effectively learn of His word.          This was told to me by a good person that walks with God:  “I was a total mess before accepting Christ, and as I started to know Him, I started to find a peace deep within my spirit, and a joy that gave me a sense of hope and purpose in this life.  That was what I had been missing, and so finding Jesus was what brought me from a life that was really almost dead, to a life that seemed to have hope and promise!   My Christian walk has been really shaky at times, but I found that over the years, God has been solid.  He has shown Himself to be Faithful, over and over again!  And you know what, God doesn’t change.  He is always the same!  Isn’t that amazing!  He’s not like people that are moody, so I know I can got to Him, I can trust that He isn’t angry about something, and He doesn’t turn me away.  This was a huge thing for me, cause of course growing up in dysfunctional family, I never knew what to expect.”             God did not sit us here on this earth and say go for it.  He gave us a script to follow, to read, and to learn from.  In a way you could call it our “Owner’s Manuel.”  It is of course the Bible.  It explains why we are alive, how our lives work, what to avoid, and what to expect from the future.  The 10 Commandments are in the Bible.  They tell us what is right to do, and what is wrong to do.  But if we don’t follow them, are their penalties for not obeying them?  No, the only penalty is how we know we have hurt God, and how it makes us feel.  If we are really honest with ourselves we will know we have done wrong. We will ask for forgiveness, and if we are sincere, God will give us forgiveness.  What more do we need?         The Bible says, “It’s in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for. Long before we first heard of Christ and got our hopes up, he had his eye on us, had designs for us for glorious living, part of the overall purpose he is working out in everything and everyone. (Ephesians 1:11)       Someone I know put it this way once;  “All of creation is like a big lump of Jell-O.  It’s composed of various types of matter and consists largely of water (the Water of Life.)  Without something to hold it all together and give it form, it would splash all over indiscriminately and be meaningless.  God is the gelatin that holds it all together and gives it form and structure.”  I want lots of gelatin in my life!        God is the Creator of all things.  God’s Kingdom is anyone who believes in Jesus Christ, and anyone that accepts Him as their Savior.  Pretty simple, huh?       Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths.  Proverbs 3:5-6       He who covers his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.  Proverbs 28:13        The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.  Numbers  6:24-26       And maybe there is another reason why we suffer in our lives.  The pain not only grows us in Godly character…but He uses it so those unbelievers will be attracted to Him.  Think about it.  If my whole world is collapsing around me, and I can still hold my head high because of God’s love, well that would be a great testimony to the faith I have in God.  Good point.       “It was good for me to be afflicted, so that I might learn your decrees.  The law from your mouth is more precious to me than thousand of pieces of silver and gold.  Psalm 119:71&72        A friend told me, “I believe a little bit of God exists in everything that is beautiful in the world, that we can experience God here on earth if we can open our minds to it.  When the sky is clear, when the sun shining when the mountains above me with there snow capped peaks, when I see the sun glinting off the water and all the lush green growth, I know I am surrounded by God’s kingdom.  We are often emerged in His beauty, if we only take the time to look and see it and take time to really enjoy it, like he intended us too.  I’m sure you have looked up at the sky on a clear night, when all the stars are out, the universe, so vast, so awesome, they don’t call them “The Heavens” for anything.  I think we are catching a glimpse of “Heaven.”  I think that explains it rather well.  you all the time.”           In my past I have turned to God.  But soon I would get discouraged.  I still had all the troubles after I turned to God that I had before God.  And those problems would lead me right back to evil. I did not know how to resist the temptation that Satan put before me.  Since then I have learned a few things.   “A victorious Christian life may still be a tempted life.”  I had never thought of it that way.  Somehow in my mind I had the idea that all temptation would completely disappear after I joined God.   But then I learned more.  Jesus was tempted.  Those temptations were very real.  Jesus felt the pangs desire for power and glory when Satan made an offer with the stipulation that Jesus worship him.  Yes, Jesus was tempted just like us “humans.”  Temptation can be a hard battle to fight.       Temptation comes when we are drawn away by our own lusts.  And as long as we are in our human bodies we are going to be tempted.  Realize there is no sin in being tempted.  Realize that you do not have to give in to the temptation.  Sin is a choice.  Yes I have a choice.  If I’m tempted to do something wrong though, I do have the choice to do right.  If I pray to God to fight the temptation he will empower me to keep that choice.  Or I can choose the wrong and Satan will take me over.  If Satan tempts us, we are told to “Submit yourselves therefore to God.  Resist the devil, and he will flee you.”  Remember, you become friends with God through His Son, Jesus Christ.  God loved us so much He provided us a way to victory.  He provided for victory even if we have a failure and yield to temptation.       “If God is for us, who can be against us?” Romans 8:31       Spiritually some things we do or allow that we might think are little of insignificant can also be disastrous for us.  Many people could give testimony as to how they have regretted giving into the desire of the moment, as sometimes a moment of pleasure can result into a lifetime of regret.  The Lord wants us to call on Him when temptation crosses our paths.  He doesn’t want us to sell out to the enemy.  He wants to help us so that we do not have to face the problems created by our sin.  Even if we fail, God will help us get up and go on, so we can turn what Satan meant for evil into good.  However, it is better that we do not fall into the pit to begin with so we can avoid the suffering and sorrow of giving into temptation.  We will still have to walk through any consequences of our sins.  God will certainly forgive us for our sins, he will even cleanse us from our guilt and shame, but he cannot undo what we have done.  So, if temptation comes my way, I need to remember to pray to God.  Not giving into temptation is so much better than having to confess my sins to God and facing the consequences of my sin.       A friend I know put it this way, “My sinful nature has a way of creeping up on me unexpectedly, and before I know it, Christ is having to save me again and again.  I need to focus and keep my eyes on the Lord.  What a wonderful life I would have if only I’d keep my eyes on Him.”         You know, everyone needs down times, and the time to just sit back and know God is God and contemplate on that if nothing else.          This was shared with me once; “I for one have a strong spiritual sense.  It is what balances me and keeps the void inside of me full.  I am not what you would call a religious person.  I do however; give of myself daily in quiet ways.  In my life I have had to overcome crises after crisis and without faith in God, I wouldn’t be here today.  My faith permeates the way I interact with people.  I truly believe that being a Christian is actually walking a path of a Christian and showing concern, helping those most unfortunate, being grateful for what I have been given and praying for God’s help.  This in my opinion is what Jesus tried to teach us 2,000 years ago.  The faith to walk forward and face each day with confidence that when I fall, God will raise me up is the way I live. I also have faith that God wouldn’t give me more problems/troubles to deal with than what capacity I have to deal with them.  And, I try to always give thanks at the beginning and end of the day for the joy of life that I have been given.           Something was pointed out to me earlier.  The question came up, “Is God a man or a woman?”  And this reply was one I had never thought of before:  “Adam and Eve were made in his image.”  So does that mean God is neither man nor woman?  He just is!  I think I like this idea very much.         Also I was talking to someone about getting my questions about spirituality and religion answered.  And they said something like this; “Maybe some of the questions don’t need to have answers.” And I realized that some things might not have answers.  Spirituality is based on knowing with your heart and soul that there is a God and that God sent his son to die on the cross, so you and I may be saved and freed of our sins.  So some questions, maybe you just have to know or sense the answers to, kinda like you know or sense there is a God.  Or maybe, it doesn’t matter if some of the questions don’t get answered.  I mean if you are waiting for all your questions to get answered before you decide whether there is a God or not, well then maybe you’ll never get the answers.  So does that mean you won’t believe in God?  I sure hope not.  Cause a lot of believing in God is about faith.  Faith he is real and loves you.  Maybe that is all we need to know.   Today, I know that I belong to my heavenly father.  And today that is enough.       Sometimes it is a struggle to understand why God works in our lives the way He does.  Sometime we just know His presence seems so real, so obvious.  Other times we wonder, “Where are you?  Why are you not with me?”   From my point of view, I am beginning to see God is with me and has always been with me.  Just sometimes I was the blind one to where he was.  Sometimes I shoved him away.  But you know what.  He always stayed no matter how bad I treated him.  And he always loved me!  Vicki Lynn Henderson Tilley Mills Hart!  God loves me and is even excited that I am finding my way to him.  He is there to touch my life and heal the hurts.  No matter how bad I am He will continue to love me.  He can fill that empty hole in my soul that has been there so long.  Makes me kinda special doesn’t it?  Not more special than any other child of God, but for the first time in my life, I have a tiny part of me believing that I am special, I am worthy, and I deserve to live!!!!      And after all, love makes the world go around doesn’t it?  With love, faith and hope, you can’t go wrong that I can see.  I need to most of all to learn how to love myself.  I need to learn to give myself lots of big hugs.  I need to learn I am worth it, like my God tells me I am worth it.  I need to learn I am an extraordinary valuable part of this life.  If I learn to love myself, maybe than I can accept God’s love.  Then hopefully I can truly love others.  And that I think is what life and God is really all about.  Love.         Hatred!  I hate hatred.  Guess that really isn’t possible huh?  But I am so tired of hatred.  Hatred for me, hatred for you, hatred for who knows what?  People can find so many reasons to hate.  And all hate does is hurt there fellow man.  Why do people want to hate each other so much!  Because they have been listening to Satan.  He has taken their hearts and turned them into a fire of hate and pain.  A heart that destroys everything in its path.  I know I am as guilty as the next person about hatred.  I haven’t hated a lot of people in my life, but hating one person is one to many.  I need to ask God to show me the way to let go of that hate, the hold Satan has on me, and learn to love other people.  I need to let the hate out and give it back to Satan where it belongs.  I need to let God and His Grace come into my life and shows me a new way.  I need to learn to turn that fire into my heart, into the love I have for myself and the love I have for God.  Love is what counts.         Do people have to go to church to be a Christian?  To that I have to answer No.  It is much better to be around others that have the same views, the view that to worship and praise God is such a joyous thing.  It is a wonderful feeling to share.  But what really matters is that we choose to celebrate Him.  If we have to do it alone, well God is not going to say no, He is not going to plug his ears, He is not going to reject you.  He will be full of love for you, because you have found your way back to Him.  I think how you do, say, and act has so much more to say about you being a Christian than going to church does.  So all you need to do is worship Him, either by yourself, or with others, either in your home, your car, in the outdoors, or a church.  Letting God into your heart and life is the best gift you can give God and yourself.  And you don’t even have to gift wrap it in a fancy church.  God loves you no matter who you are or where you choose to worship Him.       When I read some of the stories of how God has changed people’s lives, the words continue to melt my heart and warm me through and through.  Sometimes it is like I can smell healing in the air around me, it is that strength and glorious.  God is wonderful!       A person I have only met once shared these words with me yesterday in an e-mail.  They are a prime example of how words can melt my heart and warm me through.  I know God lead me to her for a very special reason.  So she could help me find my way to Him.  These words brought tears to my eyes when I first read them, “From here it seems like He is gently calling you to Himself.  He loves you like no one else can.  You’re His child.  He formed you and made you.  When you weep, He weeps with you.  When you laugh, it brings Him joy.  I don’t know if you pray, but He wants to hear your heart.  What you think and what you feel.  He already knows, He just wants you to voluntarily share it with Him.  He is true healing.  He can do miracles in our heart to bring us through the pain and darkness to the light.”  Imagine that!  Someone cares about me and wants me around!  What a novel idea!        I want to return where I have always belonged, with God.  I know there has been pain in my past, but my future is with God being in my life.  He has forgiven me for my sins from the past.  I have asked Him to help me forgive the ones that have hurt me.  God has chosen me!         And you!  All we have to do is make the choice to choose Him also.  Praise God! But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.  Matthew 6:33

           Since I have thought of suicide in the past I have often wondered if it is true that if you commit suicide you can’t get into heaven.  I have known people that have committed suicide.  They were good people, just very mixed up, and in a black hole of depression.  Should they then be sent to Hell?  In my own personal opinion, I believe that God is a loving and merciful God and therefore He knows the pain these people were in.  The urgency to stop all the pain was the only thing these people thought about.  Some folks say that those that take there own lives are not mentally capable of rational thought, so I don’t believe they will be sentenced to forever in Hell.  Sometimes people’s minds just snap and they no longer have control over what they do.  Will God understand something like this?  I know people can be cruel when someone commits suicide.  Those people need to live the lives of the people that do commit suicide, before they pass judgment. If they are going to preach truth to the world, they should start in there own backyard first.  I mean at the end of the day, does it really matter how you found your way to the source? Is there anywhere in the Bible, which I have been told is the word of God, that it states when a person commits suicide they go to Hell?  Or does it say that the only unsaved people are the ones that rejected God; are the ones that go to Hell?  What if with there last breath they ask for forgiveness from our Lord?  All I know for sure is we should never judge a person that has committed suicide, not until we have walked in there shoes for a lifetime.  Is anyone here on earth in a position to judge anyone else’s behavior?  Is there anyone that has not sinned?  I think not.    Be merciful to me, O Lord, For I cry to You all day long.  Psalm 86:3        And for punishment, well I do that very well to myself.  I punish myself in so many ways, for so long, when I feel I have let someone down, or hurt them in some way.  So no one else has to punish me, I do it very well by myself, thank you.        I think my past has led me to some very delusional thoughts.  Or as my therapist puts it “my templates are faulty.”  How do I change those thoughts, those templates?  With more work and strength that I have right now.  I want to find a high ground to stand on with my beliefs and know what are real thoughts and what are delusional thoughts.  I want to be able to tell the difference.  At this point in my life, I don’t know who I am, what I am, what I like, what I don’t like, what I believe or don’t believe, what values I want to have and keep, and what truths are right for me.  Right now everything about me, moods, thoughts, feelings, ideas, change from minute to minute depending on whom I am with or how my illness is affecting me right at the given moment.  Can any of us with Bi-polar ever get to a high ground?  I sure hope so.  I do know however, that sometimes this Bipolar/depression illness gets the best of me and that sucks.  I am so glad that God understands this and lightens my burden whenever he can.  He also sends me “angels” to keep me sane, when my mind is telling me I am going completely and utterly nuts.       God often puts us in situations that are too much for us so that we will learn that no situation is too much for Him.”   Erwin W. Lutzer       My therapist keeps saying that I am sick and that a lot of the things I have done are due to my illness.  I feel that only God got me through this for as long as this far.  Still I cannot excuse myself from the responsibility that I have screwed up many lives, including my kids.  That is a hard thing to live with.  I always wanted kids, dreamed of being a mom, and then blew it big time when I got my wish.  I really don’t deserve good after that, do I?         This leads me to another point.  I have read where “The religion of psychology has become a dangerous threat to Christianity.”  Some people believe that instead of turning to God, too many people are looking for help from a system that often denied His existence and power. I read this quoted “Sin has been replaced by disorders, diseases and addictions, while recovery take the place of confession and repentance.”  So does that mean the without true confession and forgiveness through Christ “we cut off fellowship with God and short-circuited His power to help us overcome our problems.  We cheat ourselves out of God’s blessing by throwing up our hands and surrendering to the claims of psychology.”  Also I have heard “Self-pity has replaced prayer and petition.  Support groups have replaced trust in God’s power.  Many Christians believe they have no power over their mental-emotional-behavioral problems, when all the while God waits for us to unleash His indwelling power through confession and simple, childlike faith in Him”  “Psychology turns the common experiences of life, like depression, anxiety and fear, into permanent conditions that require extensive psychological treatment.  Psychology has succeeded in duping the American public into believing that if they don’t feel right in some way, they must have a disorder and must get it treated by a professional.  But as “Christians” we have control over our behavior.  No so-called disorder or disease has power over us, regardless of what psychological ‘experts’ claim.  Instead of blaming our behaviors on disorders and diseases, we should admit our fault.  Once we take responsibility for our actions, we can trust in the Lord to help us, and He will give us the power to overcome our sinful behavior.  (Lisa Bazler).   Personally I think the person that said this has a totally different belief than I do.  Support groups I have been too insist on God’s power.  In fact a person’s powerlessness and God is the one that has been stressed so much in these groups.  Maybe not defined as the biblical terms; but trust in God’s power was insisted on.   I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and no amount of praying is going to take that away (unless God chooses to work a miracle in me).  Before I knew this, I did some bad stuff.  Therapy is helping me to find all the “bad” stuff and work through that so I can confess to God my sins.  Nothing has taken the place of God.  If anything therapy and others that help me, were put there by God to help me.  With their help I am seeing things clearer and can then reach out to God then.  I have learned that people can never take the place of God in counseling me.  They are a tool in God’s plan to help me find my way back to him.  That’s just my opinion though.          I do know that if I do not seek medical help, get medicine to make me more myself, I am there for Satan to corrupt so much easier.  I mean he can move in and just take over when I am not myself.  And if I don’t fight this disease, well then I am not myself.  Only with help from the doctors and medicine can I stay strong enough to keep Satan at bay.   I have a mental illness, a disease that often affects my relationship with God and family.  Heck, most the time it affects my relationship with myself.  But you know, it says in the Bible that suffering only brings you closer to God.  Maybe one good thing can come out of all this pain and suffering that I and others in my life are experiencing due to this disease I have.  A prayer to God from someone with Bipolar Disease      Lord, I think you might have made a mistake when you chose this latest challenge in my life.  I don’t know if I can find the deep faith and strength to handle everything that BP throws at me.  No matter what I do to get better and get past this, I usually end up making things ever so worse.  The pdoc and tdoc say there are many drugs and things out there to try, but I have been fighting so long now to stay alive, I am worn, sad, and extremely tired.  So Lord, I ask one thing of you at this moment.  Please renew my strength so I may keep fighting this fight.  Instead of feeling sad, rejected, hopeless, I want to feel good and love and hope.  Please Lord look into the inner me and hear my plea, because if you don’t someday soon I don’t think I will be able to find me anymore. Amen.         When my mind starts to take over and says “What do you have to offer the world?” or  “You wouldn’t possibly be of any use to anyone.”  Or this one, “Your life is of no consequence. ”That is nothing but Satan talking to me, trying to drive a wedge between my and God. So I just pray to God to give me the strength to fight Satan’s urgings. Satan is such a good deceiver.  Take hate for instant.  Hate comes from Satan.  It is not a good thing to have in your life, it hurts and destroys.  And what about rejection?  Are you feeling rejected by someone?  Rejection can be so very dangerous towards following God.  Rejection can lead to loneliness which can lead to self loathing which can lead to anger which leads to hate, which leads to Satan.  Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy.  He tries to destroy everything that is beautiful, including you.  Just think though, if God did not see you as a very beautiful person, Satan would not be working so hard to lie to you, to destroy you with hatred and other negative emotions and sick thinking.  God is the only way to go.  I do believe God is a very loving God and that he only wants the best for me.  Don’t give up.  God is real, He loves me and I love him, and I don’t like my life much when I give up on Him. I am just so thankful he never gives up on me.            The only thing I feel that cuts us off from fellowship with God is for us to neglect fellowship by refusing His calls to prayer.  I mean if you think about it, how clean do we have to be to approach His throne?  If we have not conquered a particular sin and keep bringing it to the Lord in prayer, does He get frustrated and give up on us?  I don’t think so.  I think when we here that voice in our head saying “enough already”.  He is going to get mad if you keep bothering Him about the same thing” it is Satan talking. And with God’s help I can learn to tune out that voice that is trying to lead me astray.       As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe became white and glistening.  Luke 9:29         Could good exist without evil?  How then we would know what was good and what was bad?  If we only see beauty, how do we know it is beauty?  Without the ugliness to compare it to?  If one has not experienced the bitterness of sorrow, how does one truly appreciate the sweetness of joy?  Can peace exist without war?        I read this somewhere and liked it.  If your wife isn’t a follower of the Lord, but is willing to stay with you, don’t divorce her.  If you husband isn’t a follower but is willing to stay with you, don’t divorce him.  Your husband or wife isn’t a follower is made holy by having you as a mate.  This also makes your children holy and keeps them in God’s blessings. I just liked this for some reason.           Maybe I haven’t learned to let God be in control of my life.  I need to learn to pray for His will, not for mine.  Whatever a Christian does should be done to honor God and show concern for others. The only person who really knows what I should do or should not do is the Lord.   I need to learn to tell the Lord everyday that my life is in his hands and he needs to do with it, as He will.  I need to want to be his servant.  I need to let Him use me for his own good.

           Just remember there are a purpose, a plan, from your heavenly Father to you.  Even when it is the darkest, God has a purpose for you, even when you can’t see it.             No one is perfect because after all we are only human.  We need to turn away from sin into the direction God wants us to turn.   God will give us the willpower to make that turn.  He will never leave you.  He will hold you close in his arms, reassuring you that you are really wanted by Him and that He is really yearning from you, a more consistent fellowship with Him.       I was just taking a bath and reading one of my books.  And I came across a section about shame.  Now if anyone knows shame, feels shame, lives for shame, it is me.  I know shame better than any emotion.  I grew up with it, raised my kids with it, and even today I am still living with it.  And what does shame mean to me?  That I am bad, no good, dirty, horrible, evil, spiteful.  And it also means the most important thing, I am not lovable.  By myself, by others, by God.  I am defective.  I am ruined.  No good.  End of story.       But now I know it does not have to be the end of the story.  Because God does love me.  How do I know this?  Because there is nothing I can do to stop God from loving me.  He created me, He sent His only son to die on the cross for me, and He truly loves me.  He wonderfully made me. Didn’t God say this: “for I know the number of hairs on your head.  Did I not promise to be your provision, your provider?  The very air you breathe I have ordered to sustain you that you may be my witnesses to this evil and perverse generation that would mock my name?”  There is nothing I can do to stop that love.  You see I have been having a really hard concept between what I do and who I am.  For me, they are the same.  Now slowly I am starting to realize the truth.  What I do is not me.  Not the real me.   Yea, I hurt people.  Myself included.  And I am not proud of that fact.  Un-intently, but a few times I have meant to hurt someone.  But those are actions. Those are decisions I made.  A course I took.  Yet, it is not who I am.  Who I am is a child of God.  And somewhere, inside of me, if I tear down all the walls, cross all the moats, climb all the mountains, squeeze through all the trees, and manage to reach the true me that is locked up inside me, I will find good.  Because God made that and me is the true ending of the story.  I am good, God loves me. And that is what I am.  Not the bad things that have happened to me.  Not the bad things I have done.  But what God created in me, that is the good part of me, the loveable part of me.  And no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, that part of me will be with me always.   And that is what I have to let out, to let shine, to let glow, with God’s love, for others to see.  Yes, there may be times that I can find no reason for joy in my life, but His joy is found in me, for I am indwelt with the spirit of His son who alone sought the will of God above all things.  That is what determines my worth no matter how I feel at any particular point in my life.       Everyone sins.  I am not the only one that has.  So in that respect I am no different than anyone else.  I am no better than anyone else; no one is better than me.  We have all sinned.  And deep inside of us all, is a wonderful loving child of God.  Sometimes that child may be buried or hidden, but they are there.  So I think now I can start to let go of shame.  Because in God’s eyes I am a good person, no different from anyone else.  All I need to do is to pray and let God into my life.  It seems so simple right now.  Why didn’t I come to this answer many years ago?       And I know that every day is not going to be perfect.  I am still human.  I live on a planet with more humans then ever.  We are going to make mistakes.  We are going to hurt others.  We are going to get hurt.  I want to be able to learn that the things that happen in my life do not define me.  Good things or bad.  If I were famous, it wouldn’t matter to God.  If I were rich, it wouldn’t matter to God.  If I were a bum, it wouldn’t matter to God. It should not matter to me. What does matter, what should have always mattered, is that I am a child of God.  And so is everyone else on this earth.  And being a child of God makes me very very very lovable.         Listening to the radio last night and I heard this:  “no one can take away the blessing of God from you.”  That really hit home for me.  How many times in my life have I just walked away from everything I owned and sometimes even from everyone I knew?  More than I can count.  So the idea that there is something no one can take from me, something that I can’t abandon, well it kinda stirs my heart.  And it is such a true statement.  That is mine, was mine, and will always be mine.  Something I can cherish and hold onto when everything else around me is going crazy.  Yes indeed, I do like this.

      I think what the Bible is telling me I can be forgiven of all my sins, and I will no longer need to cower in the distance, afraid to face God.  It is not good enough to agree to the theory though.  I must use God in all actions to fully be able to forgive as He wants me to forgive.     Forgiveness is not automatic.  The Bible make it clear that there are some conditions we must meet to obtain God’s forgiveness.  Like:       “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” 1 John 1:9  And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  Luke 6:31  Judge not, and you shall not be judged.  Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned.  Forgive, and you will be forgiven.  Luke 6:37  The biggest meaning I can find why you should become a Christian is love.  Love from God, love for yourself, and loving others, as you would like to be loved.   Do to no one what you would want done to you. Tobit 4:15 (an obscure book of the old testament.)  One should seek for others the happiness once desires for him. (The Buddha)       Buddhists believe that no matter what religion you follow, if you follow it well, the you will get a good after life.  That is how I’m thinking it should be.  Don’t totally believe yet, and as I learn more I might change my mind, but right now for this moment in time, this is what I want to believe.  And for now, this moment is all that counts.   He sought for others the good he desired for himself.  (The Egyptian book of the dead)  What you would not want done to yourself, do not to others. (Confucius)  In your dealings with others, harm not that you be not harmed.  (Seneca)  We should behave towards friends, as we would wish friends to behave toward us. (Aristotle)       I want to find God and ask Him for healing and wisdom in my heart.  I want God to take my anger and sadness away.          Someone has told me that in the bible it mentions something about not being able to “name” god and that there are many ways to “refer” to this power because to “name” it is to have power over it, and this is something no human can do.  God has the power over us, not the other way around.  Does the bible really say that, or is that someone’s interpretation of the bible?  We all interpret things differently, so who can say what is right or wrong?  I would like to believe that God knows my inner soul and heart and understands me well enough to accept any shape or form I choose to express my love and practice my faith with. I would love to know that in my heart was the presence of a absolute, reliable, and relevant truth as displayed in scripture, that I could find there the guidance I need for the direction my life should go. After all, scripture is the truth by which I could base and live my life with.  I think it is time that I embraced the truth of the scripture and started to live my life by it.  “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.” Psalm 119:105     Thus saith the lord; let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the lord which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the lord.  Jeremiah 9:23-24       Unfortunately for most of those who are here, life is not fair.  Bad things happen, not just to us but everyone.  There’s a Chinese proverb that goes something like this: a grieving man lost his wife and he went to the old wise holy man in the village to have him bring his wife back.  The wise holy man told him that he would bring back his wife, but he needed to first bring him soil from a home that had not never known sorrow. He figured, hey, piece of cake, and set off to find such a place, but every home he encountered he was met with a tale of woe, and he stayed and he helped at each one, and eventually he came back to the wise holy man and told him that he couldn’t find a home that hadn’t known sorrow.  The holy man said it was because such a home didn’t exist, that everyone had known grief and loss in there lives, however, their pain was eased by the help the man had given them, and in turn the man had started to forget his own sorrow.       I wonder if the depression I have to deal with, the chemical imbalance I have had to deal with all my life, I wonder if I shouldn’t look at it as some sort of tool to use for God’s glory?       I am having a hard time grasping the idea that is ok to direct negative emotions at God.  That it is OK to be mad at God.  That He understands all our feelings and emotions.  After all we don’t live in a perfect world, at least not yet.  If you look at the prophets in the bible, they spent a considerable amount of time crying out to God because of their circumstances.  They speak out about being paralyzed with fear or doubt.  How many times did they not speak of it, but it was in there heart? Probably more than we can count.  What about Joseph?  He is used as an example of great “faith” in the most self-esteem pounding circumstances one can imagine, but can we really guess what was in his mind?  Did he get depressed, scared, worried, feel alone?  Should we decide that he patiently and cheerfully sit in the dungeon for yet another two years while the cupbearer forgot his promise to put a bug in pharaoh’s ear?  Was all his wailing and tears upon reunion with his siblings due to the greatness of god?  Wasn’t there maybe also some relief over the deep wound of betrayal and rejection he had faced?  Was he not human like the rest of us, with emotions both good and bad?         I know I have a certain amount of anger at God, because of the life I was dealt.  But to tell God this?  Sure He can see in my heart, so why do I have to confess it to Him?  So I will know I have these feelings?  That they are not feelings I need to beat myself up about.  I know that my life has been hard.  I know that sometimes I just scream out “God, please hear me, don’t let these demons hurt me again.”  I mean isn’t He suppose to be this loving, hugely amazing being, yet let all this crap happen to me and others?  Sometimes I use to wonder if He hated me.         Now I am starting to see that maybe the “evil” is not from God trying to get even with me.  I need to always remember that God loves me, no matter what I do and no matter how I feel about Him and the more hate and anger I hold inside myself, the less room I have for love and kindness.  It takes time to come to peace with God and maybe I never will (I sure hope not) but letting go of the anger I have is something I really need to do, cause it tends to eat me up inside.  And the peace I hope will follow after getting rid of the anger and then making peace with God will be well worth it.  Hat God for what He has done to me?  Sometimes I think I get down right pissed at Him!  For some of the things that He has allowed to happen to me and for some the things He has allowed me to do to myself and to others.  Yet, I have to remember that on the seventh day God rested.   That means He was done, He had made a world that could take care of itself.  And He did give me and all the other humans free will.  Most of what ails this world today is a result of all our choices that did not follow God’s word. God will watch you be stricken, and will give you the strength to stand back up again.  After the entire Bible tells us over and over again how big God’s love is for us.  Do the best you can with what you’ve got and feel blessed for what you have.  If something is standing between you and your faith, remove it from your life.  God will gladly help you do that if you ask.   “He himself has said, I will never leave you nor forsake you.” Hebrews 13:5   Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.  James 4:8

      Is this really true?  When you ask for forgiveness from the Lord, He forgives all your sins-past, present, and future?  WOW!       The universe, heaven or hell, whatever you believe in, will deal with people that cause harm to others.  I also think when you don’t follow God, and you stray down the path of evil, He senses your lost.  Yet when you come back to him with repentance and asking for forgiveness, He will forgive you.  He loves us that much!  If only humans treated others like that.  I know I don’t.  I wish I could.  I feel so much resentment for those that have hurt me; I feel anger and hate for them.  I want them to pay and pay big time, for whatever harm they did to me.  I see evil people getting so much; material things and such, and I just don’t understand it.  Evil people should be put to death slowly and painfully and made to suffer in Hell for all eternity.  But then on the other hand, I have done some evil things in my life.  Does that make me fully evil and in being evil so deserving of an evil death?  I am so confused!  Maybe it is a good thing that God is the judge and not us painfully flawed humans.       I do feel however, that people that have been torn apart as children, destroyed in some cases, that they should only then have good things in there lives.  But it does not work that way here on earth.  I guess we were never promised an easy safe loved filled life.  If we were I must have been in the bathroom and missed the promise because I don’t remember hearing it and I definitely haven’t experienced it.  It is just something I want to believe I guess.  That there is good in life, happiness is available to all and peace in your soul is possible.                  I want to believe that there is a God out there that is forgiving, good and kind.  One that will help me gets through the rough times without losing myself in the blackness of despair.  I want the God others have that will fill that empty hole in my soul.  I do feel however, that God has never saved me.  Not the way I have heard others say they were saved.  Do I just perceive being saved different than others, or have I never really been saved?       Maybe I just have to pray to God to help me get past my stubbornness and lift this veil of deceit that is over my eyes so I may see His truth.  I have heard this about prayer:  Don’t pray for fewer problems; pray for more skills. Don’t ask for smaller challenges; ask for greater wisdom. Don’t look for an easy way out; look for the best possible outcome.       If I can continue to do right by others the best I know how and am true to myself, what more could I do? My concern now should be to build a healthily relationship with my heavenly father.  I can only pray I am not too late, because I am still struggling to get there.   Maybe I need to stop blaming myself totally for what I have put my children through and find the path to God.  The journey to love, away from hate.  After all, love makes the world go around, doesn’t it?  With love, faith, and hope, you can’t go wrong.  I need to learn to love myself.  I need to learn to give myself big hugs.  I need to learn I have worth. I need to learn how to forgive myself and how to forgive others.  I need to learn I have an extraordinary valuable part in this life.  If I learn to love myself, maybe then I can accept God’s love.  Then I can truly love others.  If I can accept forgiveness from God, then maybe I can learn to forgive myself.  And then I think I will be walking with God.   I have people tell me this about their journey with Christ:  love where you are while you’re on your way to where God wants you to be.  Also I have heard people that walk with Christ, say how much things in their lives have changed.  They say with a higher power in their lives, they experience miracles, love, and a joy that cannot be destroyed or taken away.  They say yes, God is sufficient; it is there inadequacies that cause problems between them and the Lord.  Faith in God sustains them.  They say God convicts them.  Conviction implies a way of ‘fixing’ the problems we face, a way of learning from past mistakes but not holding on to them for more than a teaching tool of what to do, and how to follow Him from there on out.  You learn to have hope instead of despair.   You learn your inherent value:  God loves all his children, because we are His, not because of something we have done.  There is a difference between having worth and being worthy.  God says we are worthy.         I would very much like to believe that “no matter how much I suffer or hurt on this earth, none of it can compare to the eternity I will spend in paradise if I just believe in the Lord.       When someone is wronged, he must put aside all resentment and say “my mind shall not be disturbed: no angry word shall escape my lips; I will remain kind and friendly, with loving thoughts and no secret spite.” (A Buddhist prayer)       The Bible speaks about every person needing forgiveness and every person needing to forgive.  Why?  Because all of us are sinners and need God’s forgiveness.  I know I am not perfect.  I need God’s grace to be forgiven, and I need to extend the same mercy to others.         When you ask for forgiveness from the Lord: He forgives all your sins-past, present and future.  And God is holy; He cannot lie or break a promise.  I don’t know why, but for some reason, on the cross Jesus exchanged His righteousness for my sins.  Now when I stand in front of God, I don’t believe He sees the cruddy, unclean person that I feel like.  He somehow sees me, washed, clean, spotless and holy because of the blood spilled by His sons Jesus.  Jesus gave His life so I could be free of my sins and myself.         I want to wipe the slate clean.  But how?  God has made forgiveness so important, that all my happiness and fulfillment depends on it – in this life and the next.      God know that everyone will be wronged.  And it is a safe bet that everyone will be wronged more than once while they are here on this earth.  And we will treat others wrongly.  More than once I would bet.  We sin against God and other people.  Unless I can learn to forgive myself and others the will be a block between my relationship between my God and myself.  Not that I won’t have a relationship with Him, just that the relationship can not go as deep as my God would like it too, if I harbor unforgiveness in my soul.            When I choose not to forgive, it will turn to guilt.  And guilt is a heavy burden to carry needlessly.  Guilt is not something God wants us to shoulder.  The Bible teaches us about guilt.  I must face my sin and deal with it head on- only then can I be free and at peace with myself.  God isn’t going to punish me for confessing my sins, He knows about them already, He just wants me to know that what I did was bad and to repent from it.  So I can be free of it.  That way I don’t have to let the sin haunt me forever.  I ask for forgiveness, God washes away my quilt and I can start again, clean in God’s eyes and my own.       When Jesus died on the cross, He took my guilt and my punishment upon Himself.  He took the guilt of my sins and bore them Himself.  He received the emotional pain of the abuse, betrayal, injustice, and scorn that I would have received myself, and took them onto His soul and set me free.  Do I really want Christ to have died in vain?  Or do I want to take advantage of this wonderful gift He has given me, and learn to go of guilt and welcome forgiveness?            I need to learn how to count my blessings, because blessings I do have even though I don’t think I do.  And I need to always remember, that others have and will suffer more than I.  For them I need compassion, just as I want compassion extended to me.           I also need to learn over and over and over again to ask for forgiveness for all the people that have hurt me in the past.  I need to ask for forgiveness for those that have let me down (like my parents) and learn to move forward in God’s spirit.  I need to really learn this if my walk with Christ is going to be the walk I want it to be.  I want to know when God looks at my heart, that He sees the best heart I can offer Him.         Whenever I can’t forgive I am sure it will hinder my closeness to God.  I have discovered people that totally believe life is not life without God’s love.  Therefore if I say I have God’s love and cannot walk in forgiveness, I am deceiving myself, and my “love” for God is just a parody of the real thing.       One of the amazing things about God (and there are countless amazing things about Him I am sure) is God does not change.  He was the same yesterday, as He is today, and He will be the same tomorrow and all the tomorrow’s to come.  Isn’t that the greatest?  Someone you can count on, trust, and know will never change.  His rules and thoughts and love will always stay constant.  That is so wonderful to me.

      God showed me today That up in heaven Are millions of babies Unclaimed, unnamed Through no fault of their own. God keeps these babies safe And lets them play and be free But God showed me today They still desire a name From a parent who remembers them God said it is not important The reasons those babies are their What is important God said Is that someone here on earth Remembers they were once in a womb. God also showed me the parents Here on earth Full of pain and sorrow, guilt and shame That stops them from remembering Their babies that once were. God told me to share with  those parents That He is a God of love, compassion, grace and mercy And He also said to tell them of His unending forgiveness For those parents who are suffering so here on earth. So if for any reason your baby was taken from your womb And you didn't get a chance to name them, or claim them, or grieve them. Know that God and your baby Only long for the day You claim your baby up in heaven, and give them their name. God knows it will be hard to go through the pain But He and your baby knows what awaits you The joy, and love and forgiveness And your child with your name. 6/14

      Heather Rose  My daughter’s name is Heather Rose And she is safe and happy Up in Heaven with our Savior Jesus And she and Jesus have done What I never thought they could or should They have forgiven me For the abortion that destroyed  Heather Rose before she got to breathe  I have come to see since meeting her That as horrible as the abortion was The greatest dishonor to my daughter Was denying that she was once a part of me.  She was once before our meeting In heaven looking down on me Waiting for the day I could Let go of my guilt and shame And give her, her name.  Now she is a part of me as she once was In my heart I will always carry her Along with her love and her forgiveness That was only hers to give  I long for the day I go to heaven And hold my sweet Heather Rose I will walk in the hills of heaven Hand in hand with my Heather Rose.

      I have been told that having a personal relationship with God or with Christ is not difficult, just talk to God.  If its confusion you feel or an inability to find faith, then let God know that and ask for help if you are sincere in seeking.  Invite God into your life.  Choose to have him in your life.  Then your faith will be strong, not because someone told you to go to God but because you choose it for yourself.  Right now I don’t feel him. I just feel emptiness inside.  I need him, but I don’t know how to reach out to him.  I have had people tell me that when they do seek out there higher power everyday, they aren’t as selfish, as ugly to others, that they are constantly seeking to better themselves in God’s name, the way He wants them to be.  Now if more people on earth did that, wouldn’t this place be a much better place to live?        For me though it is so hard to trust in anyone.  When I was younger I use to picture God like my brothers.  They loved me, just had a warped way of showing it.  My brothers would promise me good things, then when I finally believed them I would find out it was all-untrue and usually there was some pain involved in the discovery.  I use to picture God giving me this invisible carrot, (good things in my life) then when I truly believed and could see the carrot; he would yak it away from me. Or as someone put it to me once “To have what I wanted more than anything else on earth just at my fingertips and then snatched away like a piece of string dangled in front of a kitten.” And then God would just laugh and laugh just like my brothers did. I also felt like God hated me, that is why I got dealt the hand I did.  Now I wonder if it wasn’t the evil in the world that was doing this to me.  If there is good there has to be bad, or how could we tell what was good?  Right?  We have to have both, I think, I just wish I had more of the good than the bad.   I guess I really should give other people a chance before I say I can’t trust them.   But then I leap in with both feet and get hurt.  Lord, can you help learn who is right to trust?          I have read this somewhere: Trust is a precious thing. And we all want to protect it.  But keeping our struggles to ourselves is the exact opposite of what Jesus teaches.  He wants to hear all the bad in our lives as well as the thanks we send him for giving His life for us so we may be free of sin.       As a child I learned all the bad had to be kept a secret. Heck, everything pretty much had to be kept a secret from someone it seemed like.  We had to deny the bad ever even happened.  You can’t trust your own reality when you have to deny it ever really happened.  It was really a hard way to grow up as a child.       Now if I choose to follow God I need to know it is Ok to feel all my feelings.  It’s OK to break through the secrets and accept what I had to deny all those years as reality.  My reality.  God will listen to me I am told.  He will always listen to me.  And I have found a therapist who is also helping me open up and talk about the past and the present.  Ever before my journey to God started – God was watching out for me and lead me to this Christian therapist.       I think, no I know in my heart that what I have learned so far, is that the more I open up, the more God has the oppunity to minister to me.          Yesterday I could only see my journey as full as pain. Sometimes I get so scared, I feel the fear gripping my heart like a fist and squeezing the life out of me.  And it goes one drop of blood at a time, one tear at a time.  Sometimes the pain is just too much and I try to escape any way I know how so I can be free of the pain the free the doubt for a minute.  But then the demons come calling again, pulling back into my private hell.  At times like this I have no faith, no hopes, no joy.  I welcome death because whatever awaits me after that cannot be worse.  I deserve some good sometime don’t I?   I am sure there will be other times I feel this way.  I just hope when I do I have the strength to know that it will not last that it cannot overwhelm me forever.  That’s my hope right now anyhow.      I shared this paper with someone that I love very much and who is so dear to my heart.  This is what she wrote back to me:  “I hope you are building a close relationship with your “angel”.  She sounds like a wonderful woman and it would make me happy to know you have someone like that in your life.  I know you are really struggling and, from the things you write, I know what you are really searching and doing a lot of thinking.  You may not be able to think your way to God, but I don’t think you can think your way away from Him, either.    I have ordered two books for you from Amazon.  One of them  “What’s so amazing about grace” which played a big part in making it possible for me to come back to a belief in God when my friend Connie was dying, and I could see so clearly how her belief was defining the experience for her.  And Cindy too (Cindy was the third of the trio).  I remember telling Connie how incredible it was to me that she was always able to see the best in every situation and every person.  And she told me, “That’s the choice I made.  It wasn’t always easy but it was my choice.” That was really powerful for me.  To me, it’s not about understanding, it’s about acceptance, and all I did was choose to accept what I was seeing.  My questions weren’t answered, I just stopping questioning.  Oh I still do, when horrible things happen.  But hopefully I don’t let myself get stuck there for long because that is such a painful place.”  Thanks sis, you are the best.       Right now I feel that God does not give me answers to my prayers.  No let me reword that.  I do not listen to God’s answers to my prayers.  I am not sure at this time of my life, in the space that I am in, that I would even listen even if He hit me over the head with a ten-foot pole.  I have heard however, when God wants someone He goes out and get him or her.  Well if he is coming to get me, I don’t know why.  He is God after all, maybe I better not argue huh? I wish to believe in God, cause I want so much to believe in something good. In the past I tend to believe that a human man could feel the hole in my soul.  Then when they couldn’t, I would get discouraged and move on.  Now I want something to lean on, something other than myself that will never let me down. I have heard this: Jesus’ demeanor is that of being to calm the stormy waves; of conveying that everything will be all right.       The point is (I have been told) that God loves me and because of His Love for me, I am worthy.   I not required to do anything to become worthy except to seek after Him. It is a free gift.  Anyone that is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him.  Your body is a temple where the Holy Spirit lives.  The spirit is in you and is a gift from God.  You are no longer your own.  God has paid a great price for you.  So honor Him in everything you do.         Sometimes someone will ask if they can pray for me, or if they can pray with me.  That always moves me so much, and puts tears in my eyes.  Prayers, regardless if you believe in them or not, are heard by God, and have real power behind them.  I may not feel worthily of the prayers that others pray for me but when I hear about prayers for me it really puts a light on in my soul.    Maybe also when someone prays for us it mean that God is making a house call.  I would like to think that anyhow.       Sometimes I think God is watching over me.  Sometimes I think I feel something like maybe the “holy spirit” tugging at me.  When things could have gotten worse, but didn’t.  When I need a certain person to call or come into my life, they call or show up.  I think some people turn out to be “angels” and help others, like me, find our way.  It seems to me like God keeps sending people, things, miracles and angels into my life so I can keep fighting.  I just need to learn to turn to Him and not try to win the fight alone.         I have done things in the past (and I am sure I will in the future) that I would love to take back, to undo and redo the right way.  If I could only believe, then repentance and forgiveness are there for the taking.   Sometimes I did not intend things to do harm, but then harm I caused.  God still offers me forgiveness I have heard because He has a great love for me.  He has a great love for all, especially those that are sick, broken, blinded, despairing, confused, overwhelmed, delusional, manic, abused, alone, forgotten, hurt, etc etc. A little used verse in the Bible states that you work out your own way to salvation.  I need to learn that God is a God of Love.  Even when I do horrible things, God will be there and love me.   I have heard with God at your side, He will always stand by you, and maybe even send people around to give you strength or answers you need to get through your problems.  The point is to know you are not alone in your struggles.  When things could have gone worse but didn’t.  When I need certain people to come into my life. Sometimes they do with just the answer I need, or just a smile, or just a hug.  I think some people can be “angels” for other people and help me to find my way.  It seems to me like God keeps sending people, things, miracles and angels into my life so I keep fighting.  I just need to learn to turn to Him and not try to live my life alone.   Sometimes I imagine I here His thoughts “Ask, ask, come on, just ask.  I have what you need, what you want, just ask me.” I want to ask but I just don’t know how. I have failed in so much in my life; I do not want to fail at this.

      Another Roadblock  June 9, 2004   Went to therapy yesterday. Finally got around to talking about anger letters. I read one I had written. No emotions attached but I did write it. Then my therapist wanted me to see if I could write one that was not vindictive. Without causing harm to the person I am writing too. I asked him what that would look like. I couldn't imagine telling someone you are angry with them, and not wanting to strike back and hurt them back. So my therapist thought a moment and then started to say a letter with anger but not vindictive. He said a few things (don't even remember what) and then I  think he said something like and you have hurt me.And I froze. Literally. I couldn't hardly breath. Fear was overwhelming me. Why, I didn't know. I just knew I was in a state of shock and fear and panic. Got it under control and started to think it through. I knew something was being stirred up inside me, but I didn't know what. Then it dawned on me. I cannot tell anyone that they hurt me. If I do they will then have a weapon to hurt me back. I told my herapist this when I could talk. When I said it out loud, some of the fear dissipated. Anyhow the therapist said you don't have to send it, they won't know. I replied that that didn't matter.  Just the idea of me handing some one a weapon on how to hurt me was more  than I could bear.  I think it goes back to growing up. I had two older brothers, one 4 years older and one 9 years older. They had lots of unsupervised free times on there hands. And if they were unsupervised, it usually meant I was in there care.  And my brothers, especially the one 4 years older, I can't say delighted in tormenting me, but yea it was almost that. And I wasn't special in that respect, they delighted in tormenting anybody they could. And animals.  Now that I think about it, they tormented anything weaker than them. I don't have a lot of memories of that time, but I do remember running from one of them, and getting shot by a bb-gun. And I thought if they could hurt poor little animals, well I could be hurt also. They tell stories now of talking me into picking thistle flowers so I would get pricked, and eating tar, they had shaped into jelly beans. And the trick I really remember is  they would get a cutting knife, coat it and themselves with ketchup and then pretend someone had stabbed them and they were dying. Now I was 3 and 4 at the time, so I was scared to death! Through all this I knew I could not be safe with them. And I could not let them know they were hurting me, because then they would do it over and over again. And so I grew up with the thought, even sub conscious most of the time, but with the thought I can never tell anyone that they hurt me because it would give them the power to hurt me again. Not that stopped people from hurting me, but this happened when I was a small girl so I was still thinking in a little girl mentally.   So what do I do with this now? The fear that arose in me, I cannot ignore.  I need to minister to that part of me that remembers the pain, the fear,  the vows to protect oneselves. I need to comfort that part of me and let her grieve for what was done so long ago. I have to reassure her that it was not her fault and it is OK to let the hurt out now. And I can ask God how He wants to minister to that part of me. And I can ask Him to help me minister to that part of me.  I know this is just the beginning of learning to let go of this particular fear. And I know there is probably be more stuff still inside I haven't unlocked. However I feel very good about God allowing me to see this one, so I can begin the process of healing and growing. Only with knowledge can I face things, and through facing things, learn as a adult a better way to deal with them.  Please pray for me while I work through this. God Bless you.  A thought from me to you.

      Don’t you know you are the most important thing on earth to me?  I tend to flowers and trees, bird and fish.  But you, my precious wonderful child, are worth so much more to me.  You are so valuable to me.  In fact, Faith you are priceless to me.  I am interested in every detail and aspect of your life.  Nothing in your life is too small or too big for me.  Not is so unimportant it won’t catch my immediate and undivided attention.  You are the sparkle in my heart.  When you turn to me, it makes my heart thump with love and my mouth to smile. You mean everything to me.  I loved you yesterday, loved you today, and will love you forever.  There is nothing you can do to stop my love. I give it to you as a gift.  Free of charge.  Won’t you open my gift and see just how precious you are to me?  Love God, your Heavenly Father.

      May 1, 2004  Dear little me:  I give you permission to let those feelings of our past that you have kept buried & hidden for so long because you felt you had to in order to survive, to let them come out into the light of our Lord.  His light, love, mercy, grace and forgiveness - will shine on those memories and feelings until all the darkness that is in them is gone.  Sweetie, we are older now and we have tools now to help us handle them.  We have God, Nicole, Kevin, Chuck and many others to help us. We have Jesus and the Holy Spirit.  We even have inner strength I never knew we had.  You knew we had it didn’t you sweetie.  You always had it.  We no longer have to stand alone, little me.  We no longer have to worry that we will be destroyed and unloved because of what we feel or think.  We can let all our feelings out - and let them go.  We can feel them and know that by doing that we are heading down a path to freedom and love- love for ourselves and for other.  Little me, now is our time!  Time to become the woman God always intended us to be. We can handle those feelings now where we couldn’t before.  We can handle them because we now have God to hold our hand - hold us close.  God will love us and hold us if we start to feel overwhelmed. We can do this sweetie.  I know we can.  Just let those feelings go little one - at your pace and God’s pace.  I will work out for the good of both of us.  I love you.  Big me

      Forsaken and Alone Before God came into my life, I always felt forsaken and alone, Now with Him in my Heart, I feel not the same anymore.  F-orgiveness is what my Lord offers to me. O-fferings I willingly give to Him. R-esurrection  He gave to me so I might overcome         Death. S-acificed His Son for me. A-cceptance for the person I am K-now Him - all I want to do E-nemies-not a worry with God by my side. N-ever to feel forsaken again.  A-ngels to rejoice when I as a sinner repented L-ove, love and more love God gives to me O-vercoming all my sins with His help N-ever to feel alone again E-ncouragment to become more like Him.  Forsaken and alone. Never again.

      Sometimes in this life,  I feel I cannot go on  All I can feel in life is hopelessness  And despair.   Sometimes I feel that I will let others down,  And they will not love me  And I feel I will let myself down  And I will only hate me more.   Sometimes in this life  I feel so full of pain and a sense it is never going to change.          And I feel like I am an alien in a world of people  And I never will belong.   Sometimes I feel life is not worth the effort  And too much hard work to belong in.  I feel like my life doesn’t matter  And no one would care if I were gone.   Sometimes I wonder  Why life isn’t easier  Why I have to struggle so  Just to live one minute at a time.    6/7/04

      Wednesday April 28th   Last time I cut.  As I have stated before I am a self-cutter.  Been one since I was 22.  I was a self-harmer of various methods before that, but when I was 22 and tried to kill myself by cutting my wrists, I discovered the addiction of cutting.  Over the years I have been able to put it aside but I always returned to it.  The last couple of months have been bad again.  Not sure why, except learning about me and my past and how to deal with past hurts has maybe opened stuff that cutting seems the only way to deal with it.    But once again I am attempting to stop for good.  Let me tell you why.  I just left therapy and was a little upset.  We were discussing anger, which I won’t acknowledge feeling towards anyone else but myself. (Hence the cutting). Anyhow I was heading over to a women’s meeting.  That should have made me feel good, but all I could concentrate on was the anger.  So out come the blade and as I am driving 65 miles an hour down the freeway in really heavy traffic I am cutting on my leg.  The pain instantly makes me high and after a few cuts I feel good.   The anger and issue is gone.  Life is back on track.  It wasn’t until later, after I had come down, that I realized how dangerous my cutting was getting.  I use to think, no one is hurt by it but me.  But after this incident I realized I am at times putting others at risk.  I could have so easily wrecked out there.  And with the traffic I would not have been the only one involved.  I could have killed someone!  And I knew at that point how out of control I was totally was.  When I got home, I took the blades out of my purse and threw them away.  I started praying to God, asking Him for the strength to stop this.  I admitted to Him how out of control I was, and how powerless in the past I had been to try and stop.  I told Him I needed to help me conquer this horrible thing.  And He did and is helping me.  He had earlier brought a super lady into my life, who was now a very close friend and sister in Christ.  I told her the story and asked her to hold me accountable about stopping.  She said yes, and she is doing it in such a loving way that I know that decision was right.  So far I haven’t cut, because I don’t know how I would tell her, and if I didn’t tell her it would put a tear in our relationship that I am unable to do.  I don’t know if I have this cutting stopped for good.  All I can do is take it one day at a time.  I am still fighting the urge, only now I have found other things to do instead of cut.   I talk to God and ask Him how He wants to minister to this.  I ask Him if there is something I need to see in order not to be in this spot again.  I see if I can handle whatever I am feeling.  That usually means looking at what caused it and the feeling whatever it is.  If that seems impossible or too overwhelming then I call someone.  I can journal, read my Bible, Put on worship music and sing and dance along with it.  I can talk a walk and get out of the house.  I can listen to sermons.  I go out and find someone to be with.  Anything it takes to get away from the blades and being alone where I am more tempted to cut.  I am sorry I ever started cutting.  I realize at times it may have been the only thing I had to relieve stress and keep me alive, but I wish I would have know another way.  However I cannot go back and change the past.  I cannot make the scars on my body disappear so I can once again wear shorts and short sleeves.  Those I will have to live with the rest of my life.  What I can do is turn to God to stop and work towards that goal.  One day at a time, one hour at a time, and sometimes one minute at a time.  And if I fail, not to condemn myself, but move on and start again in fighting the addiction.  I know others have stopped and conquered their addiction, I think I can too.  Just some thoughts from me to you  6/7/04

      Ask  I remember that day from so long ago, like it was just yesterday.  In my mind I can picture it like I was reliving it at this exact moment.  I can feel the sun on my back, smell the freshness of the air, and see the green green grass below my feet.  I was alive that day, so totally alive, enjoying each and every moment that there was for me to enjoy.  But along with the warm wonderful feelings of goodness and life, I also discovered the horrible feelings that come from being alone, scared, and terrified. For a few moments I thought I was facing death, alone.  Only as it turned out, I was not alone, and would never have to face ever being alone again.  Never fearing death either. And that, is the best place to be.    Like I said, it was one of those beautiful days that always stays with you and like you dream about in the middle of winter.  Spring had sprung; the sun was so bright and warm, the air so crisp and clean.  I just stood outside, taking several deep breaths to fill my body and soul with the goodness of my world that was surrounding me.  I was with the rest of my family, enjoying a great day in the outdoors.  Some of the family was eating, some were dozing, and some were just standing around, talking and visiting and catching up on all the news.  Typical family stuff you know.  Me, I wanted to run.  Run, and jump, and skip and be free.  I had felt so cooped up that winter and now I was outdoors and I didn’t want anything to hold me back.  Mom tried to hold me back for a bit.  She would holler every time I got too far away, and then I would come back to her side, then something else, a new flower, a bird in the sky, clouds, grass, rocks, anything that could would leak up and catch my attention,  and off I would go again.  You know how that goes don’t you?  Anyhow, all of a sudden this great big yellow and black butterfly flew in front of my nose.  Well, I just had to follow it and say “Hi.”  And this time my mom was busy talking to someone and didn’t know I was slipping away from her sight.    I was so intently following this butterfly, I lost all track of my surroundings.  It was just one of those carefree times that comes along so often when you are a child. All of a sudden I tripped over a rock and when I looked up the butterfly was nowhere in sight.  And not only was the butterfly gone, but the sun was disappearing behind some clouds, big dark clouds.  Then BOOM!  A big crack of thunder from overhead!  I started to shake and turned around to head back to the safety of my mother, when I stopped dead in my tracks.  I was lost!  I had no idea where my mother was!  I started to run this way and then that way, yelling the whole time “Mother”, “Mother”, but all I heard in response was a boom of thunder every now and then.  I knew soon the rain would start and I would get wet and cold.  And I was all-alone, probably for the first time in my whole life.  I was getting more frightened by the minute.  As I was running here and there and not getting anywhere except more confused and terrified, I thought why I had I not listened to my mother and stayed with her?  Why did I just think of the myself and the fun I was going to have?  I knew now the fun was not fun anymore.  Finally I was just so worn out from the dashing here and dashing there, I just gave up.  I lay down in the grass and covered my eyes and waited for whatever to happen, to happen.  I knew my mom would not come and look for me; the shepherd would not let her take a chance of getting lost also.  And he could not come and look for me and leave all the others without protection.  His job was to protect the entire herd, just not one little one that had strayed.  I knew I was doomed.  But then I heard something other than the thunder.  I heard a footstep, and when I looked up, my shepherd was coming right for me.  He knew I was worth looking for!  He had left the others to come find me!  I did count!  I wanted to jump for joy but I was too tired to do anything but lift my head as he came and knelt down beside me.    Then ever so gently and tenderly, he lifted me up into his arms.  He started to carry me back to my mom and the others of the herd.  And you know what else?  He was not even mad at me for getting lost.  He was just so totally overjoyed at finding me.  He had tears in his eyes and he said to me, “I could not bear to lose even one of my flock.  No matter the sacrifices I might have to make, saving any who are lost is the most important mission I have.”  Then he told me that when we got back home to the barn, he would throw a party in my honor and everyone would get extra food!  Because this day, he had not lost one of his flock, and that was a reason he said to celebrate!  Later after the party and everyone was settled down for the night, my shepherd came over and patted me on the head and gave me a hug and said, “You belong with me.  And I will always be here for you.  When you need me just ask, I will come to your side.  I am so glad you are home where you belong.”  You know what, I was very glad I was home where I belonged also.  I knew I could never repay my shepherd for not giving up, on me and for finding me that day.  And as time went by, I realized my shepherd did not do it for the repayment I might offer to him.  He did it because he loved me.  And he didn’t want me to lost.  He wanted me by his side, where he could love and protect me.  WOW!  Don’t you want a shepherd like this?  If you don't, all you have to do is ask.  And if you ask, He will throw such a party to end all parties.  For our shepherd, our God, does not want us to be lost and alone.  He loves you, and waits for the day you will come home to Him, where you belong.  “So I say to you, Ask and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, And he who seeks finds, And to him who knocks it will be open.” Luke  11:9-10  12/26/03

          I believe that God gave us free will to choose what we want to believe.  He is like a parent, He gave us rules to follow, and it is up to us whether or not we follow them.  And just like with all things in life, there are consequences for our behaviors. If we truly “walk with God” it will show in our actions, talk and the way we live.  That is what will show others the path to God.  Not shoving our beliefs or ideas down their throats.  By living the way Christ would be happiest with, that is how you show others the love and goodness of God.   Remember what you choose to believe is your choice and no one else’s.  You are the sole owner of that decision.   People have their own different views and I think that everyone should find where they best belong and what they themselves believe in.  Once that peace is found within, everyone has the right to believe that which lead him or her to that peace.   I think that is the basis for spiritual freedom.   What do I do with all these questions I keep asking God?  And is it wrong to question God?  I often have asked God “Why God, are you doing this in my life or that in my life?”  “Why don’t you answer my prayers God?”  Questions to God I think are ok if they are not asked rebelliously.  If we ask rebelliously I am showing God the opposite of faith and are showing Him I doubt Him.  If I have not surrounded my will to God, things will happen to me because Satan still has a hold on my life.  As long as I don’t question God’s love, goodness, mercy and grace, I think questions to Him will be ok.  I hope so anyhow.  I hope that there will come a day when I will have complete trust in God, and I will be able to believe His word and never doubt His promises.           I have heard that most people that read the Bible get this message: God loves me and I love God.  Do the best with what you’ve got and feel blessed for what you have.  If something is standing between you and your faith, ask God to help remove it from your life.  Easier said than done for me at this moment I feel.        I read once “God’s original purpose was to put man on the earth to live forever in perfect condition and care for their earthly paradise.  What interfered was man’s choice to willfully sin as a result of temptation by a beautiful heavenly creature (also created by God) that subsequently became known to us as Satan.  Satan is real.  And fighting to keep free from Satan is a battle all that believe in Christ must fight on a regular basis.  According to the account in Genesis I feel, Satan put into question God’s right to rule and ever since then it has become an issue.  I think it’s clear to most of us by now, that down through all of history it has been proven that man does not do well when he acts independently of God’s will.  People do things in the name of God that they would not otherwise do (both good and evil). Which probably says more about man than God.   I have been told that Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy life.  He tries to destroy everything beautiful.  There is a spiritual warfare going on for you soul at all times.   God thinks you are beautiful, so Satan works extra hard on trying to destroy you.  Guilt and condemnation are Satan’s tools.  That would be a better theory than the one that God hates me.  Hatred can destroy you.  It eats you up inside.  And that is what Satan is best at, hate.  Do I want Love or Hate in my life?  That should be an easy question to answer huh?  Except when you are as mixed up as I am right now. Another version I have heard is that when we are suffering the worse it is probably because we are attempting to follow God, in our thoughts and actions, rather than Satan.  Satan then launches an all out attack on us to defeat our godlike acts and behavior.  The test then is to resist Satan.  Satan will throw things in our way and it is how we choose to handle them that make us real Christians and worthy of being with the Lord someday.  Satan does not want us to turn towards God!  People may be mislead or blinded by evil, but are not themselves evil, even though their actions may be harmful or sinful as a result.   Personally though I like angels better than demons, so I will stick with the Lord.       But do I really act as if God is for me?  Do I really show loyalty to Him?  When I ask for something in prayer, and when He doesn’t respond right away, do I start listening to Satan who tells me things like, “God doesn’t hear, you’re not important enough, or God doesn’t care for you.”?  Do I let those evil words seep into my soul and cause despair or do I take control of my mind and show loyalty to God and respond to those thoughts with “God does love me.”  Only by standing up for my God, even just in my mind, and believing totally in His words will I show others my loyality to God.       Right now I just find religion so confusing! Confusion is not a state of mind God desires for us.  Often I ask him to help me understand or to revel what He means.  I don’t listen very well or at all because right now I don’t hear Him talking to me.  I would like to be able to just sit back and enjoy God and his love for me, never doubting it for a minute.  Right now I still get confused a lot since I’m still finding my beliefs and so I don’t know when I am thinking straight, thinking from my head, thinking from my heart, thinking from my past, or not thinking at all. I wish I could understand it. But then I don’t think anyone, including God, understands me.  Heck, I don’t even understand me.  I wish I could understand what people find so incredible about this belief that no one has ever proved but yet if I stop and think, faith is what helped Jesus into being.  Think about it.  Mary had so much faith that she carried Jesus for 9 months, knowing on God’s word alone she was carrying God’s son.  She sang when she must have been so frightened and uncertain how this would ever work out.  And what about Joseph?  He just stepped up to the plate and assumed the role that was given to him.  How I wish I had that kind of faith.  And what about Jesus?  He had no control over when he was born, but he did choose to go to Calvary and die for our sins.  He deserves so much praise for that.  Could you die that way for strangers? I know I couldn’t.       I am also afraid that if I find God and He does make sense to me, then I will soon get bored and move on to something else.  That has always been my pattern.  I can’t stick with things for very long.  But what would there be after God?  Will I then at that point have nothing else to strive for, to believe in?  Will I then truly just want to die and get it all over with?       I recently met a woman who “walks” with Christ.  The more I think about her and her beliefs, the more impressed I am by her.  Her belief is unwavering, and without shoving it down your throat she lets you know how she feels.  She does not force it on you, but she will talk to you about it if you so desire.  And she doesn’t try to change someone that thinks different than her.  She does not stop loving them for thinking different than her.  She does not abandon them.  She has enough self-assurance in herself and God, to let others be who they are, even if it is someone she loves very much.  She prays for them and so she is helping them the best way she knows.   She has told me that thanks to the Lord, she is on the road to becoming a whole person.  His healing is an amazing miracle in her life.  I would like to get to the spot she is in her life right now.  I am just totally amazed that she could turn her life around like that.  Her life was not always perfect and good; she went through some really rough times, harsh times, and painful times.  But with God’s help she has been able to move past that, to take back her own power, to be free to be the wonderful person of “God” she was meant to be.  I hope somehow, I can keep this lady in my life.  She is one of the angels that God has sent my way.  Now if I can only listen and learn and believe.  She has such a strong belief in God, has such an established faith in him, she knows in a crisis all she has to do is pray and God will be there for her.  Me when a crisis hits, I go into such a dark deep hole and I can’t think about God.  I would love to change that.  I think she surrounds herself as much as possible with faithful people, to celebrate with others the power of God.  She has told me, that she thinks when God made us; he made us to need each other.  Sometimes she calls on someone to pray things through with, or she even calls someone to talk to them about how she feels.  She try’s to be a good person and do what is right.  She treats others the way she wants them to treat her.  She has told me that Jesus is the reason she is solid.  He is her base, her foundation, and her center.  When she is on her own she is weak, needy and self-centered.  She has told me he fills up the places in her heart so she can become the person He always wanted her to be. She has an integrity and unconditional love that I would like to attain in my life.  I need to spend more time with her.  I hope I can continue to do this.        I really admire anyone that stands true to their faith and I admire people for their strong and steady viewpoint and faith.  So many people say that Christianity has saved their lives, and that there relationship with God and Christ is the best thing that happened to them.  I would love to have that serenity in my life.       “I am looking for someone to unlock me.”  That is my quest; looking for something to unlock me and reveal God to me and to me my true inner self.  Somehow I know that my best answers are going to be found in the spiritual rather than anything else.  Sometimes though I feel that God is out there for everyone else but me.  I am separate from all other humans.  I am different, scarred, flawed, a nothing.  No one could love me, not even God.  I hurt people, I back stab, I hate, and I destroy.  I am not good. I wish I could find some faith in God.  However no matter how hard I try and get to that point, it becomes just out of my reach.  What am I doing wrong?  I wonder if God hears my cry and if he does, does he listen?  If he does listen, how come he is not in my life completely?  Maybe because I am not listening?  Does he know how much I need him?  Does he even care about me?  And yet if I look I can find examples of other people that were not “perfect” that God has saved:  Noah got drunk; Abraham lied about this wife; Jacob was a swindler; Moses had a anger problem; Hosea married a prostitute; David had an affair; Solomon had a bunch of wives; the woman at the well had a bunch of husbands; Peter was afraid of death; Miriam was a gossip; Jonah ran away from God; Thomas doubted; Jeremiah got depressed; Elijah got burnt out; Moses was a murderer.  So the next time I get to feeling insecure or not good enough, I ought to think of these great people of the Bible and how they struggled.  Guess I am in some pretty good company.  But how do I know that God is in my heart?   By my actions?  By how I feel?  I just don’t know.   (Feb 2003 on my search for God) Just a thought, from me to you

        	Growing up in a very screwed up and mixed up home as a child I learned to hide and stuff my feelings.  My survival was more important than how someone treated me or how I felt about it.  Then when I became a adult I  thought - now I’m in control.  I can allow myself to feel. I will know how to feel and do it right.  Boy what a shock I was in for!  What I didn’t know, was my feelings would end up controlling me.   I would start to feel something ( and most of the time I didn’t know what I was feeling) so I would guess, and/or base my feelings on the situation at the time.  Which was not good at all.  A feeling(s) would start to arise, so in order to deal with them, I would instantly without any thought or discussion, make a rash decision based on those feelings.  I would decide in a heartbeat to sleep with someone I just met, take drugs or drink to go along with the crowd, where to live, who to trust, who to live with, or walk out on.  I also made a decision to have a abortion, or to forget a rape, based on feelings that I could not even name at a moment. And I thought I was doing a good thing, making a fast hard decision and sticking to it!  But as I now know, decisions that are made in a heartbeat are usually very wrong.  And it continued, or I should say I continued, living my life like that for years and years.  Until God out of His endless mercy and grace, decided it was time to bring me back to Him.  And I was at that time of course (God’s timing is perfect) very willing to come back into His arms.  Once reunited with my God, I made a very conscious and willing decision to give my heart and my life to Him.  I haven’t regretted it since.  But it is funny, now that I think about it.  It took me some researching and talking and meeting with people before I made this decision.  It was not like my usual other decisions made in a rash moment.  (Hmm, maybe another thought here.) 	As I started to take this walk with my Lord- other Christians would tell me they welcomed things coming up in their lives to work on and out, because it meant on the other side of the trial, they would be closer to God and become more like Him. (Me, I was done with trials.  I thought they were (those Christians) just a tad bit crazy. They said being closer to God and growing to be more like Him, was there greatest desire for this life time.  Soon I got to think I too wanted to be closer to God, I just wasn’t sure if trials were the way I wanted to go to get there.  I was hoping there was another way. 	God is all knowing, and He knows our hearts.  He knew what I needed more than I did.  I had been praying to grow closer to Him, but the last few weeks I was feeling more distant from Him.  Not at all closer, but distant..  I couldn’t understand it.  I couldn’t seem to find Him, or feel Him.  I was starting to get very worried and scared that I would never sense Him again.  Also at that time I was working very hard on therapy issues - trying to reach down inside and unbury all those feelings from my past that I thought was stopping me from real intimacy from both my God and my husband.  Those feelings had been stuffed for so long and were so deep, I wasn’t getting far with this project either.  I was really getting to a low point in my life and not feeling at all joyful or happy.  In fact, I was getting down right depressed and low. 	So this is where I was mentally when I went to my therapy appointment.  I thought, this time I will surprise my therapist.  I will write everything down I want to discuss with him in the order I want to discuss them with him.  (Usually I would go in very unprepared, sort of a hit and miss type of thing. This time I felt there was things I really needed to make sure I got addressed.)  So I sat down and the first thing I decided I needed to discuss was some things that had been coming up in my life concerning sex.  I had only just a few sessions earlier opened up enough to broach this subject with him, because I was wanting to find the kind of intimacy and sexual relationship with my husband that God intended and meant for us to have.  There was a lot of sex abuse in my past that I had never dealt with, and that was really putting a crimp in the relationship with my husband in the here and now.  So I had decided a few sessions back to start approaching the subject and see how it goes.  We were taking it pretty slow, and in earlier sessions talked about some guidelines, and a little about the actual  subject..  So feeling comfortable (or so I thought) to talk this over with my therapist, I was ready to get into the heart of the matter(s) and really start discussing it more seriously and at greater depth. 	On the way over to therapy, (it is a 40 minute drive or so, I get lots of thinking and things done during the ride), I realized how hard I had been working on all my stuff and junk and I wasn’t getting any closer to any answers or solutions.  Why I thought? Then it suddenly dawned on me, I was trying to do it on my own.  Now I totally believe in God and His awesome power and how He can make things happen according to His will and His timing. And I realized how I had been trying to make my feelings surface on my own and on my own timing.  God was not even any part of the equation!  I immediately knew that was why God seemed distant and that I needed to once again surrender my will to my God.   So I prayed to God and asked Him for His forgiveness for me because once again I was trying to solve all my problems on my own.  I repented and again surrendered my life and will over to Him and told Him once again He had all of me to do as He seen fit.  He even had my upcoming therapy appointment at his disposal.  On a side note, I still think I have to work at all this stuff, but I don’t have to push myself until I get so desperate and start beating myself up for not accomplishing what I think I should as fast as I should.  And I knew I would always need to turn God and His loving capable hands for everything in my life, instead of relying on my own small hands. 	Anyway I went into therapy full of confidence that this time things were going to go just the way I planned and great works were going to get accomplished on my part.  After all, didn’t God feel closer now that I had repented and surrendered to Him once again?  And didn’t I have everything written down so nice and orderly? 	So I walked in, sat down, looked at my therapist and went completely mute.  Could not say anything, read my my notes, or even  start talking about anything.  So he picked up the slack and started asking me about my work on anger. I have a lot of anger issues, or I should say lack of anger issues with anyone but myself.  Last appointment I told my therapist about a upcoming family reunion and my nervousness about some past anger issues with my family.  I was suppose to address this by writing anger letters to a certain family member I was especially feeling some anger issues at.  I told my therapist that I had tried (not such a word if you really think about it, either you do or you don’t but that is for another thought) but it seemed so fake.  No emotions, just words that didn’t mean anything really.  He again stressed about how important it was to write these letters even if it might I was just “Acting as if” I was angry.  Sometimes going through the motions is Ok until you go through the emotions. (That is my line, pretty good huh? Another thought for another time.)  Anyhow we discussed that for a bit and just before the session was over I got up enough courage to bring up some the sex issues (problems) I had recently discovered and was getting concerned about.  He asked me a couple of questions - told me to keep working at it an then told me it was time to go.  I was dumbfounded! 	I don’t wear a watch so I never know when time is just about up. I couldn’t believe the time was up just as I  was getting ready to talk about important stuff!  I felt anger at myself, and I will admit a little angry at God for not helping me bring it up earlier in the session.  After all, now was the time I thought was right for talking about this stuff.  So why didn’t He (God) make it happen! So I just  I walked out of the office knowing that things had not gone the way I had expected them too, and that when I did get up the courage to talk about sex, my therapist had not responded like I expected him too. (Don’t ask me how I expected him to react, but this was not it I was sure!) 	I felt like I was in shock.  All the way home I rehearsed the session over and over in my mind.  Couldn’t come up with anything except confusion.  When I got home I tried to act normal (whatever that is.) But the whole thing never strayed far from the focus of my brain. 	Finally I gave up and went to bed.  Toss and turn, turn and toss.  Got up and started to write about it all.  As I was writing a few tears started to fall.  I couldn’t understand how I had gotten everything so damn confused!  And then it entered my mind, maybe it hadn’t went the way I expected because maybe my therapist was upset or mad at me for something!  Maybe I had said too much?  Maybe not enough?  I didn’t really know why he might be mad at me, but now I was obsessing about.  I couldn’t write anymore about that, too scary and hurtful. So I turned off the light again.  I think I cried myself to sleep.   	Came wide awake at 12:30 am.  And guess what was on my mind? All the stuff from the day.  I was driving myself nuts!  So I sat down to write in my journal and hopefully make sense of it all (if there was any to be found.)  Found a friend on chat and we talked about everything it seemed until 3 am.  After I got off with her I went back to bed.  Turn and toss, toss and turn some more.  Finally I feel asleep about 4 am clutching my teddy bear for dear life and listening to Christian music.  Even though I couldn’t feel God again, (and maybe I was still a little hurt and mad at Him) the music did help me drift off to sleep.  Woke up when the alarm went off with a tension headache and my heart hurting.  Went to work. 	Got to work and started listening to Chip Ingram and the light suddenly came on.  And it just kept getting brighter.  Chip was talking about God’s deep deep love for me.  How valuable and wonderful I am to my God.  How I am the apple of His eye.  Nothing I could do, not talking about sex, not being confused by sex, not reaching the kind of intimacy with my God or with my husband, would ever change that deep unending love that God has for me.  I realized once again, how Gods love for me is a gift, from Him to me.  I didn’t deserve it, I didn’t sacrifice for it, I didn’t work hard for it, I didn’t suffer for it, it was a gift free from my loving God to me.  And no matter how I might feel at any given moment, God would never let me down or reject me or desert me.  All that time I thought God was distant, He was really always there.  He was just being silent to give me want I needed to go down this path He was now wanting me to take.  He was giving the chance to feel things from my past.  What were those feelings of abandonment was I feeling over my therapy session than feelings of all the abandonments from my past?  And the rejection - not being good enough - not doing or saying enough- doing too much - not the right thing- all I imagined my therapist was thinking about me, was from my past.  Hadn’t I been trying to reach them for so long?  And here they were, served up by God on a silver platter.   		And the best part of all this is:  God was with me before, was with me now so I was going through this, and will be there on the other side to welcome to Him big wide open arms when I got to the other side when I get through it.  And I now know again how much deeper God’s love is and that is what counts.  God’s love is what is important.  Yes rejection in the here and now, real or imagined, will probably mean heartache and hurt and even tears, but when I get through it, and through it I will, God’s word tells me so, and I so believe in God word, when I get to the other side, I will have worked through some junk and thrown it away and in so making more room for God in my heart and soul.  Just what I had been praying for.  And just what my friends had tried to tell me.  Going through trials of all sorts can only lead you closer to God, if you are willing to go down the path with Him.  That's why mature Christians embrace trials and tribulations.  The gain, growing closer to God and His love, is so much more greater and mightier than any amount of hurt someone has to go through to get closer to God's great love and discover it.  I feel so honored and blessed with the gift of this trial God was giving me.          God was never been distant.  He was not trying to punish me for some wrong I may have thought I did.  He was not being mean to me because He wanted to hurt me.  He was just leading me down a path to greater insight about me, my past and Him and His love for me.  I can’t at this moment praise Him enough for this great and magnificent gift.  I can’t tell you how much He loves me or how much I love Him.  There are just not the right words for it.  	Footnote: When this thought hit my mind I called my therapist and left a message for him to please call me.  I don’t know if the feelings of rejection and abandonment have anything to do with him, but I do want to know for sure.  I think in this case it is better to know and then obsess over not knowing.  If it was all me, great, awesome, wonderful. I have learned a lot about myself and my truly magnificent God over all this.  And if the feelings are somehow true, then God and I will deal with them together.  I am not alone, and God will help me.      	Update in the morning 	My therapist hasn’t called.  But that is ok.  It is amazing how much better I feel, knowing God is beside me and that I have taken a giant step in getting closer to Him and to understanding myself.  The sun is shining, God Loves me - tells me I am priceless and that He loves me just the way I am and He is with me every step of my journey.  And that is at this moment, all I need to know.   	Update even later 	Therapist did finally call.  It was all me.  Boy, are we going to have lots to discuss at my next session.  	Just some thoughts from me to you.        	 May Blessings And God's Love come your way.

      Thoughts A thought appears in my mind A thought that confuses me and leads me astray I try to not think it I try really hard But the harder I try not too, The harder I do.  The more I think it The more fear inside me becomes A flame that feeds and inflames More fear The fear then starts to consume my mind  Along with the thought that lead me astray.  The more think the more fear The more fear the more think The more desperate For a way out I become The more desperate I become the more alone I feel The more alone I feel the more hopeless live seems By this thought that lead me astray.  Then when I am so tired and exhausted At the end of my rope You appear with a new rope and outstretched arms With love and peace and understanding Grace and mercy and most of all Forgiveness for me and for the thought That lead me astray.

      Failure Heard on the radio today "When I fail I am not a failure.  I don't have to wallow around beating myself up.  God loves me.  He never thinks of me as a failure.  I should not think of myself as a failure either."  So what does that mean.  This is some of my thoughts on it.  If God does not think of me as a failure and never has, and if I say I am a believer in God, it would only make sense to honor Him by thinking like He does. So that means when I think of myself as a failure, I am dishonoring God and calling Him a liar.  Thinking of it that way just blows my mind.  How many times in a day do I sub-consciously or consciously think of myself as a failure, stupid, dumb, a failure, a loser, unlovable, not worthy - or any of those other thousand degrading thoughts that I think about myself.  Do I do it 5 times a day, 10, 20, even 50?  Well if I believe that by putting myself down is calling God a liar (because He never thinks of me that way) then one time a day is one time too many.  I don’t want to call my gracious God a liar.  I don't want to think Him wrong.  So I need to think of myself like God, thinks of me.  Good, smart, worthy, lovable, and all those good building up types of words that God thinks of me with.   How do I do this?  I am not really sure.  But I think first I need to have to be conscious of all my thoughts at all times.  Only then can I change my destructive thoughts of myself.  It will probably be hard work, especially at first, but it is important for me to do this.  I can find Bible versus where God and Jesus tell me beautiful and wonderful things about me.  I can read these over and over again and memorize them.  Like Psalms 139.   And I can do post-notes with good affirmations written on them and place them all over the house to help remind me.  this will surely Help me change my way of thinking.  I can do the same with 3 x 5 index cards and carrying them with me and reading them while I am waiting in line, or at lunch, or at taking a walk And I can also stop others from saying degrading things to me about me.  Whether it is a spous e, parent, sibling, friend, or enemy, if they say a degrading thing I can just look them in the eye and say "God says I am not a failure, a mistake, unworthy, unlovable, (etc.)  And I will not let you call my God a liar."  Who knows it might even open the door for me to talk to them about God's awesome love and unending mercy and grace.  Or it might at least get them thinking they themselves maybe need to change their way of thinking about themselves also. by myself. Just a thought. 6/1/04

       But if people tell you that life will be wonderful if you are with God, they are misleading you I feel.  Faith is no guarantee of an easy life.  However your faith in God can give you the strength to endure things you might not otherwise have felt overwhelmed with.  There is only one God, and He is the Father.  He created everything, and we live for Him.  Jesus Christ is our only Lord.  He made everything, and He gave life to us.         If I feel I do not have sufficient faith to remove any “mountains of difficulty”, I can always ask the Lord for the “gift of faith.”  The Lord did not leave me without the tools to overcome my lack of faith.  I need to simply ask God to give me the gift of faith that I need for whatever problem I might be facing.  If I am faithful to my God, my faith will grow.  If I need help, all I have to so is ask God, and then have the faith to trust in Him.       Faith is not only a gift, but also a fruit of the Holy Spirit Faith will me through all kinds of trials and tribulations.  Faith is not really that difficult; God made it easy, faith is just moving closer to God.  It believes God for one more minute, then one more hour, then on more day, and then the rest of my life.  I need not give up on God, because He always comes up with the answers if I just have faith.   -      Paul wrote from prison to be content in whatever circumstance (environment) you are in because God has a purpose for you being there.  Paul wrote a great deal of his contribution to the bible while in prison.  If he had not been in prison he might not have followed the will of God to do all the writing needed to complete his books of the bible.   Imagine what the bible would be like if all of those who were called had not followed God’s will and written/recorded what God was presenting to them.  The same can also be said when we find ourselves in positions that are less than perfect, like being laid up for six weeks after surgery, facing unforeseen heartache, or even stuck in the house because it is raining.  How much better my life would be if I only thought during times like this,  “What could I be doing during this time to fulfill God’s will?”        Something else I wonder about though.  If I truly believe in God, and He fills my soul, does that mean I won’t have any future self-esteem issues?  Or that the ones I have now will magically disappear?  I do hope that somehow God does make my self-esteem issues not such a big deal to me anymore.  Maybe if I can see my value as I have been told He sees my value, I won’t have any more hate and bad feelings towards myself and who I am.  Right now though, where I am at in this life, insecurity and low self-esteem are the two things I would love to get rid of.  Can God help me with this?  Can He cure me of this?  I have been around people that “walk with Christ.”  They have an aura around them that you can almost see and that you can definitely feel.  There is a peace in them I so desperately want.  I want to take back the power of my self-esteem, but I can’t seem to figure out how to do that.  Wanting is sometimes just not enough.  For as long as I have been alive, others have had all the power and control over me.  I don’t know if it is from growing up in an alcoholic family or not.  In a alcoholic home, you never know what is coming, what kind of mood everyone is in at any given time, or what set of rules are in effect at any given moment.  And if you did feel you had it figured out, they would all change in a heartbeat and you would be back to trying to figure it out again before you got hurt physically or crushed mentally or destroyed emotionally.  I do know that because of that kind of home life, I don’t know how to act around people even to this day.  I have always been a loner because of my low self-esteem.  I mean how can I ever feel special and worthy in this world when my own mom didn’t make me feel special or worthy?  Anyone can take away my precious ounce of self-esteem with a look, a word, tone of voice, etc, etc.  I would so love to find that self-assurance, that peace, that knowing I am special, that I have witnessed in others that follow God.  Maybe I need to learn that there comes a time in my life when I have to stop waiting for my parents to be the kind of parents I wanted them to be and move on.  Maybe I have to learn that who they are is not a reflection of my worth.  Maybe I need to learn to nurture myself and love myself without being dependent on other people.  I have heard it can be done.  Why then is it so hard for to figure out how to do this?  Maybe if I can truly find my way to God He will be able to help me learn how to nurture and love myself like I have heard God loves me.       Or to put it another way, or maybe the same way in different words.  When people criticize me for not believing what they do or for anything really, I would like to be able to not let that bother me.  But instead I think and feel they are rejecting me because I am not the same as them.  Why do I let just one people have so much power over me?  Why do I feel I have to be the same as everyone else? All it takes is one word of rejection.  Then the rejection leads to loneliness, which then leads to self-loathing, which then leads to anger, which then leads me to hating myself.  And hate is not good for anyone or his or her soul.  I think I need to start believing that I am strong in my own right, secure with God before I can stop allowing others the power to hurt and destroy me.       I think that the reason why it’s so hard to try and ignore something negative that your parents say is because as a child you love them so much and you need them in order to survive.  You need them to live and you will do anything it takes to keep them in your life.  And all you want from them is to love you back, to maybe be proud of you, and to care about you.  Who else are you going to depend on to watch your back if not your family?  One of the Ten Commandments I still have a hard time grasping is “Honor Thy Father and thy Mother.”  How can I do that when they have hurt me so bad?  If I break a commandment, does that mean God will never be there for me?  I that what I have done wrong, is that why God I never seem to get it together, is because I have broken all his commandments?       Someone once told me that his or her idea of heaven is to be absent from the body and be present with the Lord.  And that there is hope.  To know that someone gave up His life so that I may live in happiness and joy and without sin and self-commendation, there would be definitely strength and comfort in that belief.  Is that same happiness and joy available to me?  That is what I am hoping for anyhow.

        I cannot think my way to God      No matter how hard I try, I cannot think my way to God.  I don’t think God will come to live in my mind, I think He will come to dwell in my soul.  I will have to feel Him, sense Him, and believe in that.  For me, my emotions have always been a burden, something that only brings pain, so it is so hard to trust in a feeling, a sense.  I really would like too but I don’t think it is possible for me.  I really wish to believe in God, cause I want so much to believe that there is something or someone that is good somewhere.  I would like to find something or someone else beside myself to lean on.         I am always letting myself down, so I would like to find something or someone that will not let me down.  I would like to think that if I had a belief system based on a loving, caring, God, that I could survive this life and all my difficulties would not be so overwhelming and always threatening to destroy me. It is hard to live happily when all you depend on is yourself.  I find that true anyhow.          So do I need proof that God exists?  Not if I only look around. There is a universe brimming over with a creative life force that did such a good job in making such beauty. I just have to open my eyes to see it.  There are snowcapped mountains that reach to the stars, there are stars that fill the night air, there is air that gives you life, and there is life to live.  What about the intense colors of the setting sun on a still ocean?  Or looking at a baby after it is born?  Wouldn’t it be great to be able to believe that a loving “God” made all this for me to enjoy? I think it would be even greater still to believe that my life and everyday I lived was a gift from God.  And that I was here for a purpose and all my pain has not been in vain.       I tend to view religion as one side of the coin and spirituality as the other.  I have come to these conclusions on them both.  Religion.     I think most religions tell you what to think, how to feel, what to believe, and how to act.   There is a general sense of human beings being unworthy, as pitiful creatures that are never good enough to be granted access to heaven on just being themselves.  God may love me unconditionally, religions people will only love me for what I can do, not for who I am. There is a lot of pressure to be perfect (or at least appear to be perfect), in most religions.  Some religions, including some Christianity, seem to pick out the worst of the Old Testament.  They try to prove that God is a spiteful, wrath-filled deity.  There seems to be a lot of anger and superstition and fear in such religions.  They don’t seem real accepting.  Not really comforting either. That is the God I believed in most of my life.  And I wanted no part of that kind of God.       A Native American leader of the 19th century once said, “Our gods water the plains, provide us with the buffalo, and care for our needs.  Your God is a God of fire and a God of anger.”         One can’t argue that this is the representation that organized religion on the whole provides to its members; God is vengeful and one false step can lead you to your doom.  The Bible I think is mostly about love.  Love and respect.  Love and respect and hope.   For every statement about “cutting off a woman’s hand,” there are more commanding men/husbands to respect women/wives.  But not just that.  They are encouraged to love them, to treat them exactly as they would themselves would like to be treated.  There is no subordination implied; only that which has been supplied by those seeking control over others.   There is a belief by some people out there that our “Heavenly Father” would be sad and crying at the way those are misrepresenting “Him” in the traditional religions.   I think mankind has used and abused the biblical texts to fit their own needs for domination and power.  That is organized religion to me.          Most of us though have a hard time accepting one full plate of religious beliefs.  As we learn to integrate bits and pieces from our formerly fragmented selves, we bring in with us bits and pieces of many different spiritual beliefs.   Wouldn’t it be nice to totally believe that God is in each of us?  Or go along with the idea that out there somewhere is something more than us?  Someone once told me this:  “I’m personally a solitary Eclectic.  (I took a bunch of things that spoke to my soul and combined them.)  You can do it that way, and no, it doesn’t diminish your spirituality, in fact I think it makes it stronger.  I personally don’t believe that any religion is the right or wrong way.  I think that most of them have a piece of the “answer” just not all of it.  No one can tell you what your faith should be.”        I have heard that in the end we truly all go to the same place, we all just get there in different ways.  It’s not the destination that is important, but the journey along the way.  I would like to believe this also.  Take my dad for instant.  He was not raised with any religion.  What religion he did see was not a pleasant way to be introduced into religion.  It was believe what I say or out you go.  My dad was always a little hard headed.  So that was the wrong way to approach him with new ideas.  Anyhow, I like to picture him somewhere with other family members being happy and well.  He was a good man; I love him very very much.  How could someone like that not be allowed a good afterlife just because he was never shown the good way to “God?”  Organized church turned me off several times when I was young.  Once they kicked my dad out of the church because he “was living in sin.” Then in their next breath they asked when I was coming back to church.  I told them if my dad wasn’t good enough for their stupid church I wasn’t either. It is hard to believe in a good God when you grow up hearing ideas like that, that is for sure.          Then there was the time that Misty died.  She was only 22 months old.  And she could not be buried in scared ground because she was flawed, sinful.  This was a baby…how crazy can you get?  Spirituality.     If I am three parts beings, mind, body and soul (spirit) of the same form, wouldn’t it make sense if all three were balanced?  Otherwise there would be much disharmony in my life.  (Which there is.)?  A sense of spiritually is important to many people.  A lot of people have told me that they see God as all, and in all. We live in a time when there is less interest in religion and more in spirituality.  People are starting to look and identify with Buddhism and Taoism and many of the eastern religions, which are more about acceptance, love, kindness, and forgiveness.  People are searching more and more for themselves. I have heard that spirituality can led you to acceptance, which will led you to inner peace, harmony and happiness.  You need to not seek religion as much as you need to seek a relationship with God.  That’s what I am hearing now.  And that is a belief I think I could follow.        I would like to have a belief in God that He will give me the additional strength it takes to get through everyday life.   Faith-Unquesting belief, complete trust or confidence, loyalty       Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” Hebrews 11:1            Faith that is something I really have a hard time grasping.  Believe in things I cannot see?  Heck, I can’t believe in half the things I can see, how can I believe in things I cannot see?  But then I get to thinking about some things I can’t see.  And the man thing I come up with is “Love.”  We can’t see love, we can’t smell love, and we can’t taste love.  But most people have discovered love at one time or another in their life; either loving someone or having someone love them.  Does that mean love is not real, because I can’t see it?  No I believe in love.  So how much harder will it be for me to believe in faith?           It is not only asking Him to help you, but it is also knowing He will help you. Without faith, there is no hope. The ability to “give up my problems to God” I feel, is due to my faith, or lack of faith, in God.  But can I really “give up my problems to God?”  Or is it more about just asking God for the guidance or the strength to get me through the hard times?  Then in the end it is up to me to solve my problems for myself or will God make them disappear?  Which is true I wonder? I have read where people say that their faith in God is what has gotten them through a lot of their troubles.  It has kept them on their feet when they didn’t think they could ever stand.  They are most alive when they are reminded of their faith, and what God has done for them.  Sometimes thought, I think people tend to get mad at God when things are bad and forgetting Him when things are good.  Or they try to resolve an issue without the help of God.  When they finally asked God for help, He would intervene and present a solution to the problem or they would suddenly see the solution to the problem.  Regardless they say when they finally let go and turn to God, things get better.  After all, there lives are His to command.  Me if I find God, I want to have Him a part of my life all the time.  In good times as well as the bad.       For we walk by faith, not by sight.  2 Corinthians 5:7       Faith is a reality, something that gives substance to things before we can see them with the eye.  When the Holy Spirit comes into someone’s life, they can see spiritual things that they couldn’t see before.  People follow Christ in faith, knowing so completely that He will not abandon them or let them down.  They learn to let God led them down the path He wants them to take, even if they can’t see why or understand it.  They learn to obey God, listen to Him, and to follow His word.  If I can do this then I think I will start to become filled and renewed, instead of empty and dry like I am now.  My heart needs to be right with God, before I can truly honor Him..       For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.  Romans 12:3         Does that mean that faith has always been in me, will always be in me?  If so that is so amazing.  Now if I can only learn to let the Holy Spirit move in my heart, learn to let my faith in God grow, and move through life confidently knowing that God loves me and has put me here to enjoy all the wonderful things He has chosen to bless me with.         I don’t think it is enough to say I believe in God, to say we have faith in Him and His love.  I think I also have to obey Him.  If I don’t obey Him, I don’t think saying I have faith will put a twinkle in His eyes like obeying Him.  And obeying Him isn’t enough.  I have to obey Him with love.  I have to read about his love, have it in my heart and show it to others.  That I think is obeying God.  And I think if I can do that, I can make God happy.   I need to learn to walk in faith to please God.  And I need to obey Him.           Real faith above all is to have total confidence in God.  To have complete trust in Him.  Real faith also believes in Jesus and all He did.  And accepting His gift of dying on the cross so I could be free of my sins and have eternal life.

      Why do I always want what I don’t have?  Why can’t I be happy with what I do have?  How come I can’t forgive those that have hurt me in the past?  How come I can’t forgive myself?  How come I continue to hurt myself?  How come I continue to drink, even though I know it is not good for me?  How come I blame myself for all the bad in my life?  How come was I raped?  How come was I abused by my mom, my brother, my stepbrother, my uncle, strangers?  How come I got married twice to men I knew were bad?  How come I had children, when I was screwed up myself and unable to give them a good mother?  How come I trust the wrong people and can’t trust the right people?  How come I feel so responsible for what others do?  How come I cannot be happy?  How come I can’t get angry with others even when they deserve it?  How come I can’t stop worrying?  How come I don’t feel that I belong here on earth?  How come I can’t make friends?  How come I am scared to try new things?  How come…how come…..how come was I born?

      Before I was a Christian I never thought much about satan. Maybe a joke here or there, but I never took him seriously. Since becoming a Christian I have learned to take satan very seriously. To any Christian, satan is dangerous and something to learn to become very wary of. Satan will always want to get that Christian back into his clutches, to give God a black eye kind of a thing of thing. Satan will always come to Christians and just stand back and watch and wait. He will stand back stalking you, lurking in the shadows. He knows your weakest points and he watches and waits until you are at a weak spot. Then he will pounce on you before you realize what hit you. The attack from Satan to take away God from your life is underway.  Satan also knows your fears. He delights in those fears. A Christian must always be aware of satan. He may withdraw from the field of battle (and a battle it is) for a while, but he will return. He loves to see you in pain.  You as a Christian need to learn to recognize satan. There is no way I can stress this enough. He is the destroyer, and wants to destroy all that is holy and good. He is the master of lies. And he likes nothing better than to remind you over and over and over again of past sins that God has already forgiven you for. God will never torment you with past sins, but satan will with every opportunity available to Him.  Satan will also attempt to lead you to new sins. He wants you to sin. He claps and jumps up and down with glee whenever someone sins. But as a Christian who is also a human, you will sin and there is a way to turn the tables on satan and make him quake with anger and rage when you sin. All you have to do is repent to your God when you sin. Christians that repent make satan blow up into nothing but smoke.  Remember satan is and always will be God’s adversity. And you as a Christian following and loving God, satan will also become your adversity. So study your enemy and learn his ways. Remember he is sneaky, and he lies, and you are with God and God will defeat him. You are now a part of God’s army and you know what? God’s army in the end is going to be the winning one.   3/30/04

      Hopelessness   Sometimes a feeling of hopelessness  And feelings of helplessness  Can totally overwhelm a person  Until any action-even one that causes pain  Seems necessary for your very survival.   Sometimes the pain inside  Gets so big and so huge  That you have to defuse somehow, anyway,  Because you cannot take even one feather touch more of pain.   Sometimes the pain is not  There is only emptiness a void inside  And you start to wonder  Am I really alive? Do I exist?  And to prove you are you cut to feel.   Sometimes you feel alone and empty  And you wonder why you continue  To breathe in and out, out and in  And you wonder why  You are alive with nothing but emptiness inside.   Sometimes life seems impossible  And you just want everything in you life  And all the darkness and emptiness to just seize.  You just want it all to be over  And you just want to sleep forever   But somewhere inside – is a spark  Of life of longing of a child long ago  That wants to laugh and love and live  So once more you raise you head  And crawl out of bed with hope.   Hope – that the pain will stop  Hope - that the darkness will turn to light  Hope – that today you might find a reason to live  Hope – that today something will keep you alive  Hope – that today somebody might care and reach out a hand.   3/31

      Nobody should die. Especially while they are still alive. And that is what I have been my whole life. Alive but dead. Dead but alive. I am alive because I continue to breath in and out, out and in. And each morning I wake up, and instantly start filling up with dread because I woke up which means I am still alive.  But dead. I walk around seeing but not seeing, hearing but not hear. I feel numb-like a darkness has surrounded me until no light can shine in. And inside me the darkness brings almost a peace. I am dead.  But alive. I eat, I drink, I go to the bathroom. I hear myself talk to others and wonder why? I act the way I am suppose to act – alive.  But dead. Going through the motions of life. Inside dead. Not fearing death, but waiting or it. Waiting for a peace I could never experience here in this world. Waiting to be all the way dead.  But alive. Walking-smiling-trying to fit in. Pretending to everyone else that there is a reason I exist. A reason I am alive.  But dead. No joy reaches my soul. No happiness in my heart. No wonderment at the world I live in. I feel dead.  But alive. To wander this life of hell. I know there are others out there in this world like me. There just has to be. I can’t be the only one, can I?  No one should die, especially while they are still alive. Especially alone.   4/01/04

      I don’t feel comfortable in crowds  Or even in small groups with friends  I feel I have nothing to say  And that I’m not as smart or funny or as pretty  As others are  And when I do get the courage to speak  I get tongue tied and the words come out all inside out  But God has show me  That when I step up and talk about Him  It doesn’t matter how I perceive myself  Or how I think others perceive me  All that matters is I am talking about Him  Not because of me, but because of Him  For when I talk about God  It please Him  And He smiles at me  And I know that what I say  Matters to Him  And He knows my heart and my love for Him  And at that moment  God and I  Know I am important and beautiful  And what I say means everything to God  And God blesses me and I bless Him  And I shine.   3/28/04

      God owes me nothing   God owes me nothing  Not even my life  But I so owe Him my life,  And so much more.  Like the goodness He blesses me with  And the gifts of mercy and grace He gives me  And also unending forgiveness and salvation.  He gives all of this to me, freely, willingly  Because He loves me.  And all He asks in return  Is that I love Him  And Praise Him  And Worship Him.  And He doesn’t mind when I come to Him  And talk to Him in my times of troubles and sorrows.  And He rejoices when I come to Him  In times of happiness and joy.  And I also know in my heart  That when I do the right think.  I become closest to God  Because He always does the right thing,  And He wants me to become just like Him.   3/29/04

      The Lord’s Prayer   Our Father  A God who is also my father. Makes God very personal to all of us doesn’t it. He is our Father who loves us unconditional, fully, completely. And unlike some human father’s God’s love for us His children will never die. It will never change. It continues no matter what we do and don’t do. It is unending, and unfailing. And it is ours from our Father God.  And like any Father, God only wants what is best for us. He only wants us to grow up strong and righteousness. And when He sees us straying from the path the He has set before us-He will discipline us. Firmly. Not a discipline done in anger, but a discipline done in love. Like a Father should discipline His children. He does it with love. And God’s love does not change any degree depending on our goodness or wrongdoing. He continues to love us the same before-during- and after. Yes, God is my Father whom I adore and look up too. My Father in Heaven.   Who art in heaven  Heaven. My Father God’s Home. My Home. The home my spirit yearns for. The home I find myself being so homesick for. The home I will someday return too. My home where my Father resides. Home.   Hallowed by thy name.  God. A name to be treated with respect. To be spoken with reverence. A name to worship too. A name to send praise too.   Thy Kingdom came  God’s kingdom. Which will someday return to this earth. The kingdom that as God’s child I belong too. The kingdom where is God is King and I am His child will be royalty. Wow!   Thy will be done  God’s will. His will be done in my life is my great need. His will to follow I so desire. His will is best for me. All I have to do is follow Him and His will. Follow it willingly, without protest or argument. His will for me be done.   On earth as it is in Heaven  Heaven on earth. Awesome. The day will come when Jesus returns again. Until then all I need to do is follow God’s will. Just like I will when I go to my home in Heaven, where my Father God rules His kingdom as King.   Give us this day our daily bread  My body craves food. My soul craves God. I crave His presence, His word, His Holy Spirit, His mercy, His grace, His forgiveness, His salvation through His Son Jesus. So everyday I need to not only fill body with food everyday, I need to also fill my soul with God. How easy and wonderful filling my soul with God is. And how blessed I am by being able to do it.  And lead us not into temptation  I live in a fallen world. My nature can be lead to follow sin so easily. Lord, please surround me with a hedge of protection and help me to fight temptation. I am weak. I need you Lord and your help. I want to follow you, not go down stray paths that will separate me from you. Thank you.   But deliver us from evil  Lord, I live in a world that at this time evil rules. Help me to keep my guard up at all times so I do not fall into the enemies’ hands. He only wants destruction for me. And he wants me separated from you Lord. God, deliver me from this evil that is waiting to pounce on me at all times.   For thine is the kingdom  God’s kingdom where goodness abounds. Where love and joy is everywhere. A kingdom filled with God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. And me, when my time comes. A kingdom I do so want to go home to.   And the power  God’s power. Strong enough to form the universe. Gentle enough to form me. Big enough to have our names written on. Wide enough shoulders to let us all lean our heads on when we are scared and fearful. Power. Real power.   And the glory  God’s glory. He deserves all our glory. All the time. For He is glory. Glorify His name in all you do. Not just at church but at all times. Very easy to do.   Forever  God. Before, Now, and Always. He was, He is, He will always Be. My God. My Father. Lord of all.

      Rape     Rape cuts through your soul, numbs your feelings, and breaks your mind.  It is a violation of your body that no one has the right to do to you.  It is a violation that no one asks to have happen to them.  Once it happens, it will stay with you the rest of your life.  It will define you, as a person, and especially as a woman.  You will think of yourself not as you use to, but as “the person that got raped.”  You try to deny it, detach from it, forget it, drink it away, drug it away, even sometimes sex it away.  But no matter what you do, it will not leave.  It will stay with you as alive.  Always there to haunt you.  Always there to destroy you.           You wonder why me?  What horrible thing did I do to deserve this?  You think, rapes don’t happen to just anyone.  I either must have asked for it or did something to cause this person to rape me.  You go back over and over and over it again, thinking, “What did I do wrong to deserve this?  Did I say something, do something, how did I lead this person on?  What if I had done this?  Or what if I hadn’t done that?  What if I had fought more, instead of just lying there with my eyes closed trying to escape in my mind to somewhere else and praying it would soon be over?”  And then you start to blame yourself.  You think if “I didn’t want this to happen to me I could have somehow stopped it.  You can’t figure out exactly what you would have done you just know you could have done something to stop it.) You try to reason it out.  And you wonder did I really want it to happen?  I could have been able to stop it if I really wanted to.  And the self-blame gets worse and worse.  And soon the steel-trap of unbearable and unbelieveable pain come down and traps your very being.  You feel so alone – you feel no one could understand what you went through and are still going through.  No one would understand your feelings, your thoughts, your spirit being torn away from you.  Hell, you don’t even understand it yourself.        I am here to tell you now though there is hope.  There is a way to overcome being raped.  You’ll never forget it completely but you can overcome it.  You can find happiness and joy and even love again.  And you will find a day when you can make love with no remembrance of the rape intruding on your thoughts or your feelings.  You will even be able to find yourself again, and you will learn to love yourself – despite of what happened.  You can redefine yourself not as “the person that got raped” but as the person “that overcame a rape.”  You will learn to hold your head up once again.      How may you ask?  It won’t be easy.  It will be a long hard battle, but a battle you can win!  And trust me when you win, and you will win, you be thankful you fought the battle.”         First and most important is to learn and know with every fiber of your being, that you are not at fault.  I was not at fault.  You were not at fault.  Not 90% at fault, not 50% at fault, not 25% at fault, not even 1% at fault.  It was not your fault!  You didn’t want to be raped.  You didn’t ask to be raped.  You did not do anything to deserve being raped.  It was not your fault!  You did not “imply” you wanted it.  No one wants to go through a rape.  You did not want too. No what anyone says or said, It was not your fault.  All the fault is on the person that raped you.  Every little bit of it.       Your body is your body!  You have control over it!  No one else has the right to do things to your body that you do not allow.  At any point in a physical encounter- with anyone- (Stranger, friend, lover, boyfriend, and yes even husband’s) you have all the right in the world to say “no”.  If someone breaks through your “NO” what happens after that is all on there shoulders.  You could not have fought harder.  You could not have screamed and stopped it.  You could not have done anything else to stop it.  You didn’t ask for it and you sure didn’t want it to happen.  No one wants to be raped.       So if it takes a thousand times a day for the rest of your life, you must come to believe it was not your fault.  Because that is the truth.  The whole truth.       Next and this can be almost as hard as the rape itself- you must tell someone.  For your own sake- you have to tell someone what horrible, evil, thing has been done to you.  Find someone you can tell.  Your mom, sister, aunt, friend’s mom, a friend, teacher, therpist, minister, a hot line or on the internet, tell someone!  Just find someone to tell.  Not to get the rapist in trouble, even though for some that is a terrific way to progress down the path to recovery, but for you!  You need to hear someone say “What a horrible, terrible, awful, thing for you to go through.  What a destructive thing to happen to you.”  You need to hear someone say “It was not your fault.”  You need someone to share the pain with, the grief with, the loss with.  And if possible you need to have someone hold you while you cry.  But if they can’t hold you, if you aren’t ready for that, then at least be able to share your tears.  You may see that they are crying for you also.                And you need to cry.  Make yourself cry if you have too.  Cry about the pain, the embarrassment, the lost of innocence.  Regardless if it was your first time for sex, or  your hundredth, you still lose some innocence.  You lose a lot really.  You lose trust and know you whole being has been violated.  So cry, cry, cry and then cry some more.  You won’t cry forever no matter how it feels like you will.  And the pain will subside.  Either will destroy you.  I know this won’t be easy.  Nothing connected with the rape will be easy.  However, for your healing, crying is very important.  And the hurt of the crying will be nothing compared to the hurt you will feel inside if you bottle it up and let it fester.  It will soon eat you up inside.       You must fight the thought and feeling that you are now “damaged goods.”  With every fiber of your being you must fight the thought “I am ruined for life.”  And spit out the thought “No decent man will want me again” as soon as it comes to mind.  You are not any of this-now or at anytime in your life.  You are still God’s daughter, sister to Christ and still very worthy of all that and me.  You do not have to have to accept second best because you believe that is all you deserve.  You need to start to want and look for the best, because you are the best.  The rape does not change that.  You still deserve all the good this world has to offer.           And last, remember you are not the only woman that has been raped.  There are more women out there than you know.  Find one if possible and share your pain with each other.  With sharing you will find the pain start to subside. 8/03

       Discouragement – seeing things as they are with no hope of change or improvement. And even just a little discouragement can become overwhelming and lead you down the hill of despair. A hill impossible to climb because the discouragement weighs you down and you can’t climb. I know this because I have been their many a time in my life. Too many times really.       I use to think my whole life was one of suffering and pain, discouragement and despair, wariness and emptiness. I really didn’t or couldn’t’ fill hope, know hope, or even begin to think I deserved to have hope in any aspect of my life. My world was full of a black nothingness with no way out. Or at least no way out that I could see.       And yet, here today, I stand before you – with hope in my heart and light throughout my soul. How may you ask? It was really quite simple. Really …..       One night when despair was engulfing all parts of me and I felt no reason to go on in this life or on this world – I heard a knock. A knock on my heart and in my soul. A knock from my now Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.       Until that moment – I knew no one with such kindness, love, grace and mercy. I especially did not know anyone who wanted to give me all this as a gift – freely and willingly. All I had to do was accept the gifts and Jesus as my Savior.       I did – and my life has not been the same since. I now know hope, where emptiness use to be. Now I have light, where darkness use to reside. Now I have a joy in my heart, when their use to be only despair. And I have love in my soul, where their use to be only pain. And you know, it was really quite simple to get this. Really…..       There is always hope when Jesus is your Lord and Savior.       Vlh 7/30/04

        God did not create the world to be full of problems and sadness.  That is not His way.  However, when sin entered the world, it brought with it sadness and pain, suffering and sorrow.  Sin is responsible for the bad and evil in the world, not God.  God is a God of truth and love, faith and hope.  God has always loved you.  Before you were, God loved you.  He loves you today at this moment of time.  Won’t you open your heart and let His love in to shine on your soul? Vlh 7/30/04

        I wonder what that would be like?  To not need approval for who I am.  I grew up in a home full of abuse, abandonment and neglect.  I don’t ever remember feeling loved, wanted or even accepted.  Now I am slowly learning about God’s love, acceptance and His desire for me to be a part of His family.  Sometimes, everything is going great and I feel all that, with no room for doubt.  I almost feel I am who I am, and that is Ok, if you know what I mean.  Other times, when the depression, the pain, the hurts, the sorrows from my life come to the front of my mind, I again feel those old feelings, that I am not loveable, not accepted, not wanted.  And I have to once again struggle to find all that in God.  I am just so thankful that He is always there. On top of everything else God is, He will never abandon me.  No matter how many times or how long it takes me, He is patiently waiting for me, cheering me on.  Yes, God is who He is.  He does not need my approval.  He does not need my acceptance.  He does not even need me.  But I need Him.  And that is the best need in the world to have.    Vlh 7/30/04

       I knew a little girl once   Who had the saddest eyes    That would bring you to your knees.       She could not smile    She felt no joy   Pain was her only friend.      She didn’t know why    Life had to hurt so bad   And make her cry inside.      She tried to be good   Tried and tried and tried   But still the pain would come.       It came from her mother,   Her father and brothers   Uncles and strangers.      Then one day the pain    Became too much    And the little girl was no more.       Now the little girl    Is a grown woman    With eyes that look dead.       I knew a little girl once   Who had the saddest eyes   That would bring you to your knees.    VLH 7/30/04

       My emotions are bouncing off the walls And off the ceilings and floors too They bounce and change, change and bounce Faster than the blink of a eye.    They are swift to change To turn me upside down I cannot pin them down Not matter how hard I try.    They make me cry - they make me laugh I feel on top of the world Then lower than dirt All in a snap of your fingertips.    It is so hard to act or react Or make a decision or plans When you know your feelings will change And nothing will ever be the same. Vlh 7/29/04

       God exists in His own right, not in my limits of what I think He is.    God is. No matter if I choose to believe in Him - He still is. If I don’t choose to follow Him - He is still God. If I don’t choose to accept Him as savior - He is still the Savior. No matter how I choose to feel about God- He is God. Isn’t that awesome?    God has no limits. I may to put limits on Him put it doesn’t fly. I may attempt to put limits on His power - but alas, His powers have no limits. I may think His love is limited to " Good   Christian’s or Saints"  but I cannot put limits on God’s love because He does not have limits on His love. Nor can I put a amount on His forgiveness or mercy or grace. Everything God is - is. No matter what I think or feel, or don’t think or feel. Isn’t that wonderful?  God is - because He is. He exists- because He does. He is who He is - because that is how it is. VLH 7/29/04

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Doubts I use to doubt my own ability. I doubted my own worth. I doubted that I was loveable. I doubted that  I even had a right to be alive on this planet. I even doubted I had a right to breathe.  Since coming to know God I have discovered that yes, I do have abilities. God given abilities. Yes I am worthy. God made me that makes me worthy and priceless. Yes I am loveable, God loves every little tiny bit of me, so that makes every tiny bit of me loveable. Yes I have a right to be alive, to worship my God and to tell others about His goodness and love. And yes I even have the right to breathe. Because that is how my God made me, and everything He makes is worthy, loveable, priceless and precious. Vlh 7/29

       Dear God: I choose Lord , to believe you allow pets in Heaven. Please God when "Girl" gets to your gates today, welcome her in with a big hug and a party to give her thanks for the wonderful pet she was to us all these years. We could not have asked for any better. Lord, pat her head and let the shine come back into her beautiful long coat of white. Let her legs become strong again so moving will be a joy for her. Give her bones to chew on and a nice soft cushion to rest on. And Lord, please let her keep her memories in tact, so when we all come to Heaven she will be at the gates to welcome us, her tail wagging- her smile big and bright like we will always remember- her big brown eyes, bright, intelligent and happy to see us- and her love shining out as us as we join her once again.

       I am different than anyone else here on this earth, especially in my mind. My mind doesn’t think like other minds. Sometimes it just goes off on these tracks of it’s own - and no matter how hard I try I just can’t stop it. It might take the track to self-hatred where I end up self-cutting. It might take the track to despair where I can find no hope and life seems unbearable. It might take the track to the past where I am once again reminded and relive the betrayal and hurts that were done to me so many many years ago. Or it might take the track to confusion where I don’t know at point what is real. I don’t’ know why I was cursed with this mind - but I wish someone else had it - and I had none.

       Faith What is faith? I have heard it described in many ways - different meanings to the same word. But what does faith really mean?&nbsp; Could it mean: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Faith is the believing that there is a unseen supernatural place outside of our world called  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HEAVEN.  Faith to me is the total belief that there is a God that presides in Heaven. Faith is believing that He is a loving God - only waiting for the day I get to join Him in Heaven. Faith is believing that my God - in order for me to join Him at home in Heaven someday - sent His only Son Jesus Christ to die a horribly cruel death here on earth so that I may be washed clean of my sins. Faith is believing that this deed would have been done even if I were the only person on this earth. Faith is believing that my God will never leave me, abandon me, desert me. Faith is believing my God will take my hurts, sorrows, mistakes and use them not only for my healing but to heal others.  Faith means to me that our dog "Girl" who is being put to sleep tomorrow will be heaven   when I get there . Faith means to me that God will always catch me one more time than I fall. nd faith means to me that this life is only a moment and someday when my moment is over I will return to spend forever and a day in Heaven - my Home!  What does faith mean to you?  Vlh 7/27/04

        I am working on learning how to handle my fear. Fear tends to grip my heart in a vise and keep my mind from functioning on any kind of rational level. Fear has been, it seems like, how I have lived my whole life. However, now that I have allowed God in control of my life, I no longer have to live in or with fear. My God is a God of love, not of fear, and He will help me conquer my fear if I just allow Him too.      When I start to feel fear, I have to be willing to look inside myself and discover what the driving force behind the fear is. Yes I know it will be scary. Yes I know it will be hard. However I also know I do not have to face my fear alone. God will be with me, holding my hand, carrying me if necessary and loving me every step of the way.       When I look at the fear, I need to remember all the above and calm myself down enough to find out what is feeding the fear. It could be a fear of abandonment, a fear that has happened over and over again in my life and what I am always dreading when someone is in my life. God can conquer that fear, He will never abandon me. It could be a fear of rejection, one I have also faced most of my life and one that can destroy my life in a split second. God can conquer this fear, He will never reject me. It could be a fear of failure, the one fear that has stopped me from living life to it’s fullest cause I don’t want to fail, so I don’t risk at all. God can conquer this fear, He made me and He does not make failures. It could be the fear of being unloveable, which since for so long I could not even love myself, how could I expect someone else to love me? God conquered this fear, He loved me enough to allow His Son to die for me.       I know when God looks at me all He sees is love. I need to look at the fear and know in my heart it is not true, for my God tells me it is not true. God does not want me to fear anything. So when I discover fears starting to overcome me again, I need to remember to calm down, find the root, and then with God’s help, cut it out. God will help me fight both the emotions of fear and the beliefs that lead me to fear. He will show me I need not fear, not now, not tomorrow, not ever. With His love and help I know I can conquer all my fears. Not in a day, not in a week I am sure, but over time I know I will. I believe in Him and He is not of fear. This is one of the million reasons I love my God - He governs not by fear but by love. Vlh 7/26

       TEACHERS &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ======== &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After being interviewed by the school administration, the eager teaching prospect said: "Let me see if I've got this right. You want me to go into that room with all those kids and fill their every waking moment with a love for learning." And I'm supposed to instill a sense of pride in their ethnicity, modify their disruptive behavior, observe them for signs of abuse and even censor their T-shirt messages and dress habits. You want me to wage a war on drugs and sexually transmitted diseases, check their backpacks for weapons of mass destruction, and raise their self-esteem. You want me to teach them patriotism, good citizenship, sportsmanship, and fair play, how and where to register to vote, how to balance a checkbook, and how to apply for a job. I am to check their heads for lice, maintain a safe environment, recognize signs of antisocial behavior, offer advice, write letters of recommendation for student employment and scholarships, encourage respect for their elders and future employers. And I am to communicate regularly with the parents by letter, telephone, newsletter, and report card. All of this I am to do with just a piece of chalk, a computer, a few books, a bulletin board, and a big smile AND on a starting salary that qualifies my family for food stamps! You want me to do all of this, and you expect me NOT TO PRAY?" &nbsp; ~Teacher Unknown~

       Sometimes the struggle I face with this thing called life Just seems to much and too hard to face And I want to crawl back in bed And forget that the world exists. Sometimes in the stuggle with this thing called life All I can see and feel is hurt And the pain becomes more that i can bear And I just want to hide where no one else is. Sometimes in the stuggle with this thing called life I don't know how to act or what to do or say And I feel like a fool when I am around others And I just want to hibernate and be alone Sometimes in the stuggle with this thing called life My heart feels broken and shattered into dust And I wonder how come I continue to try and go on And why I continue to struggle in this thing called life?

       One night I was lonely and lost.  Then I heard the wind blow And on the wind I heard these words You are important Don’t give into despair Don’t give up on yourself Don’t give up on me. I made you with love I formed you with faith I offer you hope I give you life Hold on to me With all of you might I will never let you down Nor will I ever forsake you I am your Creator, your God I am the one who loves you most Don’t ever forgot my child I made you to be. Then the voice disappeared on the breeze And I was left with the memory of it And a feeling that no matter what I was never alone. Vlh 7/22

        I was asked the other day what would my idea of heaven would be like. And I instantly thought, well the sky will be a light purple, the sun a dusty rose. It won’t be too hot or too cold. Their would be lots of oceans and nice sandy beaches. No garbage. Animals and people together side by side. Flowers and trees and scents to fill the air that were very delightful to the nose. But the more I thought about the question I realized that is not what I want my heaven to be. Or I should say I want me heaven to be even more. The main thing I want in my heaven besides God that is, dnd loved ones and things like that, is the idea and knowledge that no one will ever be able to force their will on me. And the more I thought about that the more I realized that is all I really want for heaven to be like. So much of the pain in my life has been put their by other people that were bigger, or stronger, or older or ...... It doesn’t really matter what they were. What mattered is they could force me to do their will at whatever horrible cost to me. They could force me to go hungry, or be sad, or be scared, or hurt me mentally, or sexually or psychically. They could, through more means than I can mention, make me do what they wanted me to do, not matter how I felt about it. And that, I believe now at this time in my life, was the greatest harm that was done to me during my childhood and even now while I am a adult . So I want my heaven to be a place where if I say NO, that is what will stand. I want it to be a place where I can’t be taken advantage of because I am weaker, or smaller, or just because someone else would delight in seeing me suffer.  What would your idea of heaven be like?  vlh 7/22/04

      &nbsp;&nbsp;    My past is always with me, stalking me like only a stalker can.&nbsp; Just lurking there, waiting for the moment to come in and pounce and devour me - just when I think I am safe. And it is always there, behind me, around me, inside me.&nbsp; No matter how hard I try to escape it – I can’t.&nbsp; No matter how hard I run or how far I run, it is always their laughing and haunting me.&nbsp; No matter how hard I try to fill my mind with other things- it still sits there in my mind, looming over all other things with it’s darkness and gloom.&nbsp; No matter how hard I try to wall my heart from the pain and regrets from the past, it’s vapors seep through and shatter my heart over and over.&nbsp; No matter how hard I try to protect my soul from the evils of my past it is not enough. Never enough.  &nbsp;  Hurts-disappointment-pains-sorrows-heartaches and live aching wounds from the past never want to stay in the past where they belong.&nbsp; They like to twist and turn, churning my insides, and causing worries in my mind and ruining every second of my now.&nbsp; I can’t escape them.&nbsp; Not while I am alive anyhow.  &nbsp;  So what do I do?&nbsp; I grit my teeth and go on.&nbsp; And I hope that someday things will change.&nbsp; But so far each day gets heavier and heavier and my heart gets wearier and wearier.&nbsp; And I struggle on – attempting to keep putting one foot in front of another and wondering every second– can this really&nbsp;last until I die?

      Satan will do anything to destroy your relationship with God.&nbsp; He delights in it.&nbsp; He dreams of it.&nbsp; It is his meat and bread so to speak.&nbsp; He does this by telling us lies about ourselves.&nbsp; Remember he is and always will be the master of lies, of deceptions, of manipulations.&nbsp; He will try his best to make you believe that God doesn’t even like you, let alone be willing to forgive you.&nbsp; He will whisper to you that your sins are so hideous, so evil; God washed His hands of you long ago.&nbsp; He’ll work really hard on making you believe you are nothing but scum, that no one could love you, especially God.&nbsp; So what do you do?&nbsp; You fight Satan, with every fiber of your being.&nbsp; You go to the Lord, you ask others to pray with you, and you keep your eyes focused on God and His word.&nbsp; Work on believing with your whole heart and mind, that God loves you, wants a beautiful and wonderful relationship with you, wants you to come to Him so He can forgive you.&nbsp; Why else would God send Jesus to die such a horrible death if it wasn’t for the forgiveness of our sins, so we may be clean in God’s eyes. God loves to and will vaporize our sins in a heartbeat – if we only ask.&nbsp; Won’t you ask today?Vlh 7/16/04

       Calvary was the fulfillment of me receiving God’s forgiveness.&nbsp; Jesus paid the price for my sins.&nbsp; Not with money, not with gold, not with jewelry.&nbsp; He paid for my sins with something much more precious.&nbsp; He paid the price of my sins with His blood, His suffering, and His torn humiliated beaten body.&nbsp; And He paid with His life.&nbsp; And He did it willingly.&nbsp; He could have backed out at any moment.&nbsp; He could have called a million angels to come save Him.&nbsp; He could have saved Himself.&nbsp; He could have destroyed all the bad men that were destroying Him.&nbsp; But He chose not too.&nbsp; He chose instead to die. He loved me too much to let me face eternal death.&nbsp; Se He died for me on a cross, by a horrible excruciating, terrible, unimaginable painful death.&nbsp; Wow!  &nbsp;  So let me ask you a question.&nbsp; Will you chose to go through your life facing eternal death or will you instead choose to lay down your life and follow Jesus Christ?&nbsp; You laying down your life for Jesus will not be how He laid down His life for you.&nbsp; You giving up your life of sin and getting reborn again will not be painful, humiliating, terrible, or even a discomfort kind of death.&nbsp; No- your death and rebirth as a child of God, will be something of unbelievable joy and happiness for you.&nbsp; And not only for you.&nbsp; If you listen real carefully, you will hear all the heavens rejoicing that you, one of the lost sheep, has returned home.&nbsp; And returned back to the arms and safety of your Father God.&nbsp; Doesn’t that sound like what your soul is crying for this very moment?  &nbsp;  Vlh 7/17

Don’t you know I could never let you go?  For you are my child – my creation – forever and a day.  Vlh 7/14/04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      A friend is one who walks in and stays by my side, when all others run away from me.  Jesus is the greatest friend that any of us could ever have.  But He will not be a friend to you, unless you chose to take up His offer of friendship.  Being friends with someone is a two way street.  Both parties must want the friendship, must desire the friendship, must yearn for the companionship and warmth that a friendship has to offer to both parties involved.  The Bible tells us that Jesus desires that kind of relationship with each and every one of us.  The question is: Are you willing to say yes to the greatest offer that will ever come your way?  This offer for friendship is offered to everyone.  No matter your age, your race, your background, you wealth or lack of, or what you have to give.  This offer is offered to you no matter your past, no matter what mistakes you feel you have made, no matter where you are at this moment in your life.  All you need to receive this friendship is be willing to accept Jesus as your personal savior and Lord of your life.  You know, He even went so far to show you how much He desires you to become your friend,that He sacficed His life for you and died upon the cross for you.  Won’t you say “YES” to this supreme and awesome offer and accept Jesus as the best friend you will ever have? VLH 7/12

      For the first time in my life sleep has now become my enemy.  Now it is something I am running from - not too, something to escape from - not leap into.  Sleep has always been like a friend to me, something I run to when I need comfort and peace.  But now, it is something different, something scary, something to be avoided.  Why is this happening to me?  Now is this point and time in my life?  I don’t know.  I wish I knew the reason why.  But for now all I know is that it is.  I want to sleep - I need to sleep.  I am getting worn out and tired and grumpy.  But I am scared to lie my head down on the pillow and close my mind and try to shut off my mind.  There are things in my sleep now, things I can’t remember upon awakening, but things that seem so real and frightening anyhow.  I wake up terrified, of what I don’t know.  I just know I am working hard at avoiding sleep cause those feelings are scaring me really bad.  So night after night I stay up until my eyelids are bricks and I have to go to bed.  And when I open my eyes in the morning, I jump out of bed and into life as to forget and bury the feelings that arose during the night.  Someday I hope to find out what this is all about.  Someday I hope that sleep becomes my friend again.  Someday I hope........  Vlh 7/10

      How will I know when I am doing God’s will?  If I were to know His will for me, wouldn’t it just be as easy as breathing to follow it?  I know God wants to lead me – even more than I want to be lead.  Being lead is like surrendering I think.  I know as God’s servant I should be willing to accept both surrendering to my Lord, and to accept that He is leading my life now.  But my sinful nature bucks and kicks inside me at the thought of either of these.  So how do I just let go and surrender?  Just let go and be led?  I know God’s words tells me – no promises me – He will instruct me and that He confides in those who fear Him.  I know that the understanding of God’s will is not only for the most devote Christians, but also for all Christians even me.  The why can’t I see what it is?  I know God’s will is good, good for me and for others.  I know that my Heavenly Father always has my best interest at heart.  That He wants me to shine and love this life He has given me.  I know all this.  But sometimes, knowing just doesn’t seem enough.  Or am I just not Christian material?  In Psalm 32:8 David wrote “God will instruct me in the way I should go.”  But how do I hear God’s will, know God’s will, so I will know how He is instructing me to go?  How do know what path to follow that will lead me closer to Him?  In Proverbs 16:9 it says that although the mid of a man plans his way, the Lord directs his steps.  How do I know God is directing my steps and not my sinful nature?  I know God wants me to do things that will help me walk in His ways.  Maybe by doing some things I will learn His will for me.  Like rejoice always.  Rejoice for what I have, instead of being bitter at what I don’t have.  I can pray.  Pray without ceasing.  Pray at all times.  Talk to God like He is my best friend.  Because truth be known He is my best friend.  He will always be their for me, always love me, always be willing to catch me everything I fall.  I can give Him thanks for everything in my life.  I can give Him thanks for my life.  And I can be open to being controlled by the Holy Spirit.  What do you think?  Maybe discovering God’s will is also about knowing “who” He is.  Maybe just learning His words and soaking in His character will lead me to seeing His way for me.  For His character is with reproach.  And He will never let me down, even when I let myself down.  Right?  Striving for a rich abiding relationship with my Lord certainly couldn’t hurt when it comes to discovering my God’s will for me.  At least that is what I think.  Being obedient to Him – following His words and commandments will help also.  Can’t hurt anyhow.  Being willing and obedient to do all He asks of me is also a plus.  Even if I don’t want to go to Africa, (just as a example), if He asks, I must be obedient to His will and be willing to go.  I must know this in my heart.  After all – why should God show me His will, if He knows I have no intentions of following them.   Sometimes I know I tend to rush in and make rash decisions based on my feelings at the time.  And that must stop.  That is not a good way to follow God’s will.  After all that  would be about me and what I want or think I want – and not about my God’s will for me which is always the best thing for me.  And the most important thing I need to do I feel, and the most difficult for me, is to be still and listen for His voice to let me know what His will for me is.  My mind does not like to shut down – it always wants to be in control and wants to try and find the best way to make things work out for me.  And if my mind or my feelings are in control of my life – I know my God will not force Himself on me and get in control.  That is just not his way.  Maybe knowing God’s will is not so difficult after all.  Just my thoughts  Vlh 7/9/04

      July 8, 2004  My dearest God:  Nineteen months ago Lord I didn’t even know you.  I didn’t want to know you.  Heck I never even thought of you.  And then Lord, you worked one of your awesome miracles.  In my life and me.  Where you had started to open a door to you a crack, so I could test the waters so to speak – you threw open the door and I rushed through.  I thirsted for you, and you gave me water and quenched my thirst.  I hungered for you – and you feed me with your words. I yearned for you – and you met me in so many different ways and so many different places I was constantly blown away.  You led me down a road I never thought possible for me to go down.  I discovered and felt and believed in your awesome love for me.  I experienced totally forgiveness for all my sins, from you.  And with that forgiveness I was able to start forgiving others and myself.  I found friends Lord – women friends.  Friends who love you, and who when they looked at me seen good and warmth in me.  You rocked my world Lord, over and over again, with all you mercy and grace.  For the first time that I could remember I actually felt some peace and joy in my life, in my soul.     But alas!  Now I am feeling fear.  Fear in myself Lord.  Fear this has all been a dream.  Fear I don’t have what it takes to be admitted into heaven.  I keep going back to “Bruce” in the Left behind series that got left behind even though he was a preacher. And sometimes the doubt and fear that I am a “Bruce” overwhelms me.  Am I just going through the motions of being a Christian?  Am I just pretending all this is true and right and real Lord?     I know this may not make sense to you Lord –it sure as heck doesn’t to me.  It is however; something that has surfaced to mind – several times in fact – and now I feel it is time to admit these fears and feelings to you and myself.  Time to take a risk sort of speak.  I know you know this all Lord – but at last I am finally ready to admit it to myself.  Lord, I don’t know what you will do with this.  Lord, I don’t know what I will do with this.  I just know I can’t go on any longer pretending these thoughts and feelings don’t exist in my heart, my brain and my soul.     So here it is Lord.  Now, please tell me, how do I precede from here?  Love your servant Vicki

      It is really possible Could I really actually experience Could I really actually enjoy A best day in my life?  A day I could celebrate This person that is I And all my accomplishments And hardships too.  A day I could hold my head high Knowing I am loved and cherished Held in the highest esteem By my Father God in Heaven.  A day I would look around And marvel at all my Father has given me. The sun, the trees, the birds, the air, The morning dew, the clouds, the flowers, the world around me.  A day I could get outside myself And make another smile Perform an act of kindness That only God will see.  A day I would tell all the special people In my life just special they are A day I could play with a child And become like a child myself.  A day I wouldn’t worry about anything Because I would know God’s divine plan Ensures everything will be just fine.  A day I would be grateful For the woman God made me to be I could rejoice in all I am The good and the bad parts of me  And when the day would turn to night I would stand outside and look Up above at the stars in Heaven And stand in awe of all my Father God made.  A day that would turn into night When before I would crawl into bed I would get down on my knees and I would thank my God For the best day of my life.  Vlh 7/8

      When I see dirty dishes in my sink, I thank God for the food that made the dishes dirty.  When I see dirty clothes to wash I thank God for the clothes I have to wash.  When I see an unmade bed I thank God for the bed I have to make.  When I see my lawn that needs mowed I thank God for the lawn I have to mow.  When I see my messy house I thank God for my house and the people to mess it up.  When I see my unwashed car I thank God for my car to wash and drive.  When I see my family in all their faults I thank God richly for that family and all their good.  When I see myself I thank God for making me.  Vlh 7/8/04

      7/08/04  Dear God  I guess I need to start this intimacy journey I want to take with you.  I haven’t been with you lately- have I?  For that I am truly sorry.  Right now, like with this waiting for the other shoe to drop thing (things are really good so bad has to follow), it goes back to the old God I use to perceive.  I know in my heart that you would not cause me harm that you do not way harm to come my way juts to have a good laugh at my expense.  I know that in my heart.  But over that and my heart is a shadow that I’m wrong.  That you are that kind of God.  And Lord – I don’t know what to do with this knowledge.  My first instinct is to beat myself up over even thinking or feeling this way.  But I know that won’t solve anything.  So Lord, now that I’ve told you – what happens next?  How do I deal wit this now that I have acknowledged a fear that is in that I thought I destroyed long ago?  Lord, I’m turning this over to you.  Help me please – show me the way to totally destroy and remove these thoughts and fears from my heart, mind and soul.  I love you God.  I know you can do this.  Thank you for doing it.  Amen

Will I see sympathy and mercy Or will I see meanness and pain?  Will I see acceptance and caring Or will I see trouble and a oppressor?  Will I see humility towards me Or will I see someone that wants to terrorize me?  Will I see that I am worthy Or will I see that I am not?

      Sometimes my life gets really good And everything just falls into place When everything is perfect and good Just the way I want my life to be.  At times like this I feel so luck to be alive I feel so blessed  In this perfect time and place.  And yet underneath the joy Is the sledgehammer waiting to come down That will prove to me once again Good things only come into my life to lead the way for sorrow  So I can't allow myself to be totally free To feel all the goodness and the love and peace Because I know right behind all of the good Is the trouble that follows with all its pain.  And so I wait and wonder After good times come my way And try to figure out what the trouble this time will be Following the joy that came my way?  For in my life I always know Where their is good - bad is soon to follow And in order to survive I must keep this always in sight.  Joy cannot be allowed to be felt All by it's self Sorrow must also be kept in sight To keep my soul from dying.  I wish I could just enjoy Good things that come my way Instead of always waiting For the pain I know that will always follow.   Vlh 7/6/04

       There is no way my life can be only one lifetime.  No way can so much confusion and pain, terror and fears be contained in this body of mine.  Maybe that is why after all these years; I have become deadened through time.  My body just has had all the suffering it wants to take.  My mind has said enough!  One doesn’t want to feel anymore – one doesn’t want to relive the memories of the past another second!  So now what has been going on for my whole lifetime is now coming to an end.  I am dead inside and out – a person once – but now just a shell - deadened through time from horrors I cannot deal with any longer.  My question now is, how long will this shell of a body decide to hang around?  Vlh 7/30/04

       Anticipation- the act of looking forward; especially : pleasurable expectation                         visualization of a future event or state      As children we anticipate almost everything.  I can even remember sometimes anticipating the new day and the new wonders it might bring my way that the anticipation kept me from sleeping.  And anticipation – if we are blessed - we never outgrow it.  Only now that we are older we anticipate bigger things.  And they can still make us become like children again and quiver with excitement.  And they still might have the power to keep us up at night in anticipation of what tomorrow might bring.  Since God has entered and became a part of my life, I have found a new sense to the anticipation.  Now when I think of God and His ways and His promises, I get anticipated at all sorts of new things.  And this anticipation makes my soul sing!  Lately I have been doing some dwelling on the anticipation of Heaven.  The Bible tells us we cannot as mere humans fathom what Heaven will be like!  And that for me raises my anticipation level to an extreme high level!  I can imagine the greatest joy I have had (when my boys were born) but God has even more joy to offer me.  Shivering and quivering at the thought of that!  And you know like a child again, I may not fall asleep right away just thinking of it.  Because my soul knows someday, in God’s perfect timing, it will return home – Heaven. And that is an awesome homecoming that I might just have to dwell on it a bit tonight.  Might stay awake in fact.  HMMMM let me think:  Heaven – Where I will be reunited with family and friends I had to say good-bye too here on earth  Where I can talk to the animals and they talk back  Purple trees and Orange skies Fresh air so fresh that it will sting my nose when I breathe  No aches and pain - I will jump rope and run and play hopscotch for hours  Asking God questions like – what just was the purpose behind mosquitoes?  Being with God, laughing with Jesus  Singing with the angels songs of worship to God with voices so pure and harmony so great all the birds join in  What about you?  Got any ideas of your own ?VLH 8/9/04

        This is really cool and no doubt God planned it this way.  THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE  This is pretty strange or odd how it worked out this way. Even if you are not religious you should read this:  What is the shortest chapter in the Bible? Answer – Psalms 117  What is the longest chapter in the Bible? Answer – Psalms 119  Which chapter is in the center of the Bible? Answer –Psalms 118  Fact: There are 594 chapters before Psalms 118  Fact: There are 594 chapters after Psalms 118  Add these numbers up and you get Psalms 1188  What is the center verse in the Bible? Answer – Psalms 118:8  Does this verse say something significant about God’s perfect will for our lives? The next time someone says they would like to find God’s perfect will for their lives and that they want to be in the center of His will, just send them to the center of His Word!  Psalms 118:8 (NKJV) ‘It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.’  Now isn’t that odd how this worked out (or was God in the center of it?)  Author unknown – Or was it God????

       I am slowly learning that contentment will never be found apart from God.  Peace in my soul will never be found without God.  No matter how hard I think I should be able to obtain peace and contentment in relationships, jobs, or body image, it will never happen.  Those contentment’s and peace are flitting, here today and go tomorrow.  Not so with God.  God is here then, now and forever.  Only through God can I find a contentment that I can hold onto in good and bad times.  Only with God in my present and Heaven in my future will I ever begin to see that everlasting peace is possible to obtain.  God is the only way to find calmness in a storm – when the storm is flowing all around me and through me.  He is the anchor that will help me find contentment and peace even in the trials and storms of my life.  God is all knowing, all-powerful, benevolent and wise.  And He loves me completely and unconditionally.   He will be there for me always – wouldn’t you like this also?  Just invite God into you heart and your life – trust in Him.  And then contentment and peace can become a part of your life like it is mine.      Vlh 8/8/04

       At times the thoughts in my head seem to hide out loud.  I know they are hidden in my head – no one else can see them or hear them – but to me they seem so powerful – so strong- so real – I actually seem to hear them spoken to me out loud.  And they have the power to echo over and over again through my head.  Persistent!  Clamoring for attention!  Demanding to be listened too.  Like an angry 2 years old throwing a tempter tantrum to get their way.  Wanting to be the center of attention - so though they hide in my head but  yell out loud in my mind for me to listen to them.

       God has no need for a garbage can.  I heard that on the radio today and it just blew me away!   He doesn’t make anything that needs to be tossed in a garbage can.  He doesn’t make mistakes that need to be destroyed.  He doesn’t waste a person, animal, flower, sunset or sunrise.  That is just the kind of God He is.  And I realized that even though God doesn’t make mistakes – what He does make does make does get thought of as trash by us “human.”  We even think of each other’s as trash sometimes.  Heck, if truth were known I think of myself as trash sometimes.  And until I heard ‘God has no need for a garbage can’ I never really thought about how that stinking thinking of mine is telling God what He made with love and caring and such joy, is trash.  I am a creation of His – an awesome creation – and I should never, never think of myself as trash or garbage or as a mistake.  Wow.  Viewing this sure gives me a different perspective on how damaging it is for me to think badly of myself.  How much it must pain God!  How about you?  Do you realize you are a very special unique creation that God made?  Do you know like I never stopped to realize, that He never makes mistakes and does not want or need a garbage can for any of His creations?  No matter how much you or I may screw up, God still loves us.  Can’t we do the same?   God does not have a use for a garbage can, especially for you or me.  Vlh 8/8/04

      Appreciation - an _expression of admiration, approval, or gratitude  Since I have come to know God, I am learning how to appreciate.  Oh I use to appreciate things like family, job, good movies, etc.  But now I am learning to really appreciate things, things I never really did before.  Things I know God has put in my path for me to appreciate.  My goal now is to be aware of these gifts from God and watch for them.  And take time to appreciate them and give thanks for my God who so enjoys giving me these things to me enjoy just because He is the God He is.  He is so wonderful!  The other night I was tossing and turning in bed.  Couldn’t sleep, mind racing on and on and on.  Finally got up to wonder the house.  Came across and an open window, and looked out.  There was a full moon - which caused with moonbeams to dance on the lawn and trees in my backyard.  Made me tear up - reminded me of how much God loves me.  I am sure that moonlight would have been their had I been sound asleep in my bed, but you know, God is just the type of God to give me that moonlight just when I needed it.  So I took it all in, letting its peace and serenity soak through my soul.  And I thanked my God for all He does for me.  I told Him that I appreciated Him more than words could say.  And another time.  Once again down in the dumps, lost in my own world.  Not really paying attention to what was going on, on of those type of moments.  Then my computer beeped, an email.  Glanced at it, and low and behold, a smile began to spread on my face.  Then a chuckle and then a laugh came out of me.  In that moment I was able to get out of myself and come to appreciate how precious friends are.  For a friend, that God placed in my life, sent me an email that was funny and cute and made me laugh.  God is so good in placing angels in my life  - that without even knowing that they are doing it, they touch me when I need it most.  Yes, another reason I appreciate God and all the little things He does.  And last but not least.  The other morning I had to get up real early to come to work.  I am not a morning person.  Not at all.  Needless to say I was just a little grumpy.  Walked outside only to look up at the sky, and couldn’t move for a few minutes for the beauty that God had placed their.  All the oranges and yellows streaking through the sky from a sunrise I usually tended to sleep through.  I was awestruck.  And as I drove to work I watched that beautiful site in my rear view mirror, just again soaking in a peace only God can give to a soul.  And they were even talking about the glorious sunrise on the radio.  By the time I got to work the grumpiness was gone, washed away by the swirling brilliant colors of a sunrise that God sent for me to appreciate.  Appreciation - an _expression of admiration, approval, or gratitude.  What I feel for my God who loves me and gives me so much to appreciate.  VLH 8/9/04

        My world was dark with no light inside.  And yet here I stand before you today – with new hope in my heart and light all through my soul.  How may you ask?  It was really quite simple.  Really.  One night when despair was engulfing all parts of me and I felt no reason to go on – I heard a knock.  A knock on my heart and my on my soul.  A knock from my Lord and Savior - Jesus Christ.  Until that moment – I had not known anyone quite like Him.  I knew no one with such kindness, love, grace and mercy.  Especially no one with all this and more - who wanted to give this all to me as a gift, just because I am me.  All I had to do was accept the gifts and Jesus as my Savior.  I did – and now my life is one filled with light not darkness, hope not despair, love not hatred, peace not conflict.  It is so totally wonderful and awesome and I have never, not even for one split second, regretted turning my life to God.  Wouldn’t you do the same?  Vlh 8/5/04

        I am sure almost everyone has heard of a social worker.  A kind soul who longs to help those less fortunate – giving of themselves and of their lives.  Yea, I know not all are like there.  After all, they are also only human, and can be evil just like the rest of us humans.  However for the most part, I feel that some social workers really want to do their best and help others in need.  They desire to do good – just sometimes it doesn’t work out like that.  Just like my life I guess.  That was my life until I met another kind of social worker.  I wanted to be good, but ended up doing evil.  I seemed to be on a path of destruction – hurting and harming everything in my path – especially myself.  Then one night I had all I could take – and I was broken hearted and ready to throw in the towel – when an unbelievable being showed up.  He surrounded me with His presence.  He touched my heart with love.   He granted some peace to my soul.  I was in awe of HIM!  And you know what.  He was not only a great social worker, with a heart of kindness, He was more.  Truthfully I would say He is a magnificent miracle worker.  He does not decimate, does not choose sides (except against pure evil), and does not judge you by your looks, age, race or monetary value.  He doesn’t like you just a little or just for today.  He doesn’t base your worth on what you have or haven’t done.  What He does do is love you, just as you are, with every ounce of His being.  And He has a big huge heart for you.  And why is He such a miracle worker?  Well besides the big things like He created the world out of nothing, and He creates things like glorious sunrises and beautiful graceful things like butterflies, He has done miracles in me and for me.  Even before I knew Him and accepted Him as my Savior, He was there for me.  When I was 22 and had my abortion, He was there and planted the seed of hope in me that maybe someday that horrible mistake I made and the pain I caused would be used for something good.  I knew that then, and now after going through Rachel’s Vineyard Retreats I know it even more.  Another thing He did before I knew Him or even wanted to know Him, was He placed my husband in my path and in my life.  He knew I would need my loving, kind, super supportive husband Chuck to help me through the difficult hurdles the world was going to place in my path.  And then when I was finally broken and down, He placed a Christian therapist in my life to help lead me to Him.  All this and more are some of the miracles that God the ultimate miracle worker has done for me.  So if you want a miracle worker in your life, someone in your corner, someone who loves you, mistakes and all, just as you are, please just ask Him into your life.  He is waiting eagerly for the invite from you. He longs to solid part of your life and He really longs to do miracles in you.  And if you let Him in you will know like I know now that God is the                     MIRACLE WORKER FOR YOU! Vlh 8/6

        Many times in my life I have been dropped, crumpled and ground into the dirt by the decisions I’ve made.  More times than I care to remember I have been stomped on, kicked by, punched with, and knocked out the circumstances that have crossed and criss-crossed my life.  All this and more have lead me to the thought of utter belief I have, that I am worthless.  Worthless to myself, worthless to my family, worthless to the world.  And believe me, I know this from the bottom of my soul- that is the awful way to live.           Thank goodness that has all changed.  Or I should say thank GOD that has all changed.  I now know I have a loving God says otherwise.  No matter what has happened or what is going to happen or what has gone on in my life, or what is going to go on in my life or no matter how I feel about myself, my God loves me.  When He looks at me He sees something of very intense value, something that has enough value God sent Jesus to die for me.  Ever have someone die for you? You have you know.  Jesus died for all humans, whether or not they choose to accept that fact or not.  He did it for me, for you, for the neighbor down the street.  Heck, He even died on the cross for the bully that picked on you during school.  When God looks at me and at you, He sees us as a priceless object, beyond the value of all things.  A million pieces of gold- nothing in God’s eyes compared to you.  A million zillion tons of diamonds.  He doesn’t even notice diamonds if you are around.  He loves you that much.            Anyhow the point I am trying to make is this.  I need too, (and if truth be known a lot of you out there also need to do) is to start looking at yourself not through your eyes, but through the eyes of God.  His eyes see what is real and what is really important.  If I can only learn to do this to other s and myself, well I would be a lot better person inside and out.  And that is what God wants for us.  To be happy and in love with ourselves as well as happy and in love with Him.          Vlh 8/5

       Lately I have felt like I have streaming silent tears softly, gently, falling down my face that only I know about.  Tears that are wet and salty and warm and they fall – invisible – endless – always.  Why I am crying these tears – I haven’t a clue.  I just feel them slowing falling down my cheeks – and I have a sense that they are telling me that they have been locked up inside of me so long – they had to escape.   They are dead but so alive – not real but completely real to me.  And they have been so much apart of me for so long, that I am afraid when they finally dry up - I will then become nothing but an empty husk – void of all life, pain and love.  So I pray the tears will keep falling – this silent tears stream from my eyes – that prove to me that I am alive, not dead.  Tears that also prove to me that I am real – and not an empty shell that only exists. Vlh 8/4/04

        Lately I have noticed my mood has slipped down a bit and I am doing odd things.  Which for me can be really odd indeed.  I try to tell myself it is just a medicine change that is causing this rather odd thinking – but I really don’t know.  What if what is happening is the meds bringing out the real me and I have been this odd all along – yucky!  It really isn’t something I can really pinpoint  – with my mind sometimes I can’t tell what is real and what is a product of my mind’s imagination.  Lately it has gotten worse.  Sometimes I can almost believe my mind has now become it’s own personally being- and doesn’t want to have anything to do with me.  I can be going along in my day and everything is good – dee, dee, dee, dum, dum, - when CRASH! BOOM! – Loud drums and steel guitars suddenly come blasting into my mind where just a second before a nice soft melody dee, dee, dee, dum, dum was.  And the crash and boom is so loud, I can’t seem to think.  While I can’t think, my mind takes over and I just don’t seem to exist anymore.  And this new mind, it is a not so nice mind.  It tells me lots of mean things, like I am unlovable, unworthy, that I don’t deserve to live.  Then that mind of mine – or maybe not my mind – shows me things like me standing in front of a mirror tearing my eyes out.  Which mean I run like hell the other way!  So now you know why I say my mind or this mind of it’s own, is causing me to think and do odd things.  I need my eyes, to read, to see my grandchildren, to write, I would never in a million years normally think of tearing my eyes out.  So is it the meds causing this odd thinking?  I sure pray to God it is.  Otherwise one day my mind, might win and I will be no more.  Vlh 8/4/04

        We must be hurt in order to grow;      We must fail in order to know,      We must lose in order to gain.      Some lessons are learned best      Only through pain  .    Sometimes      Our vision clears      Only after our eyes are     Washed with tears.          Sometimes     We have to be broken,      So we can be tender,      Sick so we can rest and think better;      On things more important Than work or fun;      Trip near death, so     We can access how we’ve run.           Sometimes      We have to suffer lack,      So we can know God’s rovision,      Feel another’s pain,      So we can have a sense of mission.       So take heart, my friend      If you don’t understand today,      Instead of grumbling,      Ask God what He means to say,      In order to learn you must endure,      And learn to see the bigger picture.           In order to grow, you must stand;      Look beyond the hurt To God’s loving hand      That takes what is good,      And gives what is best,      And on this blessed thought,      Rest.       As your anxious heart,      With questions, waits,     God’s hand only gives      What His loving heart dictates.          Sometimes the Lord calms the storm;     Sometimes HE lets the storm rage…      And calms His child.      Better the storm with Christ…      Then smooth waters without Him.

        Dear Child:           Effective immediately, please be aware that there are changes you need to make in your life. These changes need to be completed in order that I may fulfill my promises to you to grant you peace, joy and happiness in your life. I apologize for any inconvenience, but after all that I am doing, this seems very little to ask of you.  I know, I already gave you 10 Commandments.  Keep them.  But follow these guidelines, also.           QUIT WORRYING     Life has dealt you a blow and all you do is sit and worry.  Have you forgotten that I am here to take all your burdens and carry them for you?  Or do you just enjoy fretting over every little thing that comes your way?           PUT IT ON THE LIST Something needs done or taken care of.   Put it on the list.  No, not YOUR list.   Put it on MY to-do-list.  Let ME be the one to take care of this problem.  I can’t help you until you turn it over to me.  And although my to-do-list is long, I am after all, God.  I can take care of anything you put into my hands.  In fact, if the truth were ever really known, I take care of a lot of things for you that you never even realize.           TRUST ME     Once you’ve given your burdens to me, quit trying to take them back.  Trust in me. Have the faith that I will take care of your needs, your problems and your trials. Problems with the kids? Put them on my list.   Problem with finances?  Put it on my list.  Problems with your emotional roller coaster?  For my sake, put it on my list.  I want to help you.  All you have to do is ask.           LEAVE IT ALONE     Don’t wake up one morning and say, “Well, I’m feeling much stronger now, I think I can handle it from here.”  Why do you think you are feeling stronger now?  It’s simple. You gave me your burdens and I’m taking care of them.  I also renew your strength and cover you in my peace. Don’t you know that if I give you these problems back, you will be right back where you started?  Leave them with me and forget about them.  Just let me do my job.           TALK TO ME      I want you to forget a lot of things.  Forget what was making you crazy.  Forget the worry and the fretting because you know I’m in control.  But there’s one thing I pray you never forget. Please don’t forget to talk to me – OFTEN!  I love you.  I want to hear your voice. I want you to include me in on the things going on in your life.  I want to hear you talk about your friends and family. Prayer is simply you having a conversation with me.  I want to be your dearest friend.           HAVE FAITH      I see a lot of things from up here that you can’t see from where you are.  Have faith in me that I know what I’m doing.  Trust me, you wouldn’t want the view from my eyes.  I will continue to care for you, watch over you, and meet your needs.  You only have to trust me. Although I have a much bigger task than you, it seems as if you have so much trouble just doing your simple part.  How hard can trust be?      SHARE     You were taught to share when you were only two years old.  When did you forget? That rule still applies.  Share with those who are less fortunate than you.  Share your joy with those who need encouragement.  Share your laughter with those who haven’t heard any in such a long time.  Share your tears with those who have forgotten how to cry.  Share your faith with those who have none.           BE PATIENT      I managed to fix it so in just one lifetime you could have so many diverse experiences.  You grow from a child to an adult, have children, change jobs many times, learn many trades, travel to so many places, meet thousands of people, and experience so much.  How can you be so impatient then when I takes me a little longer than you expect to handle something on my to –do –list? Trust in my timing, for my timing is perfect.  Just because I created the entire universe in only six days, everyone thinks I should always rush, rush, and rush.          BE KIND      Be kind to others, for I love them just as much as I love you.  They may not dress like you, or talk like you, or live the same way you do, but I still love you all.  Please try to get along, for my sake.  I created each of you different in some way.  It would be too boring if you were all identical.  Please know I love each of your differences.           LOVE YOURSELF      As much as I love you, how can you not love yourself?  You were created by me for one reason only – to be loved, and to love in return.  I am a God of Love.  Love me.  Love your neighbors. But also love yourself.  It makes my heart ache when I see you so angry with yourself when things go wrong.  You are very precious to me.  Don’t ever forget that!          With all my heart I love you.      GOD

      I  just had to write to tell you how much I love you and care for  you.  Yesterday, I saw you walking and laughing with your friends: I hoped that soon you’d want Me to walk along with you, too.  So, I painted you a sunset to close your day and whispered a cool breeze to refresh you.  I waited – you never called, and yet I just kept loving you.       As I watched you fall asleep last night, I wanted so much to touch you.  I spilled moonlight onto your face – trickling down your cheeks as so many tears have.  You didn’t even think of me; I wanted so much to comfort you. The next day I exploded a brilliant sunrise into a glorious morning for you.  But you woke up late and rushed off to work – you didn’t even notice.  My sky became cloudy and My tears were the rain.      I love you.  Oh, if you’d only listen.  I really love you. I try to say it the quiet of a green meadow and in the blue sky.  The wind whispers My love throughout the treetops and spills it into vibrant colors of the flowers.  I shout it to you in the thunder of the great waterfalls and compose love songs for birds to sing for you.  I warm you with the clothing My sunshine and perfume the air with nature’s sweet scent.  My love for you is deeper than the ocean and greater than any need in your heart.  If you’d only realize how I care.  I died just for you.          My Dad sends His love.  I want you to meet Him.  He cares, too.  Fathers are just that way.  So please, call Me soon.  No matter how long it takes, I’ll wait because I love you.        Your friend,      Jesus          author unknown

       Seen in the paper the other day    "Childhood molestation scars victims for life"    And I thought that this was the understatement of the century. Yes, it does scar it’s victims for life. I know because I am one of those victims. I am one that has those scars. They are awful! The pain, secrecy, shame and guilt that came with the acts that left the scars, were unspeakable and horrible! As a victim I lived in a secret world by myself - brokenhearted, in loneliness and fear. Fear and loneliness were my constant companions. The worst kind of companions a innocent child could have. Because even through the molestation happened to our bodies, we were still innocent. We didn’t make the choices, they were made for us. We didn’t choose to do these unspeakable acts, they were chosen for us. Innocent, yes very innocent. Someday I try to run faster then the pain those horrible acts caused me - but it is hard to run from memories -and memories you don’t even remember. And how do you run from something that seems so real all the time? Even though it may just be a memory, that memory can grip you heart and soul and be so real, you don’t know if it is a memory, or happening all over again. How do you live with something like that always haunting you, stalking you? And the stuff that you can’t remember? You shudder and wonder- was it even worse than I remember? The burden of the molestation becomes so unbearable - you start looking for anything that will take the memories and pain and shame away - even for only a moment or two. And before I knew it, I had a hard time finding where "I" was inside myself. As the years pass, I become more progressively mentally, physically and emotionally sick from these childhood acts. I found myself going from doctor to doctor, from med to med, from therapist to therapist, trying to stop the fear and pain, but it just grew and grew. Nothing would stop the pain I felt except death. And before I know it - I am longing for just that. So far I have manage to beat the memories. I am still alive. But these scars from my childhood molestations, yes they will be with me for my life.

       I know in my heart and my soul and my mind that God is my strong tower. He is there to protect me when I am afraid. In the loving embrace of His arms I should find peace. But sometimes I cannot seem to find the way to Him. At times my own self gets in the way. At other times the enemy gets in the way. Yet even in those times God is waiting for me to reach Him again. His plan is not only that I get through these battles but I get through them victorious and stronger in my faith and stronger in my love for Him. God is working in me - in good times and through the bad times. And He promises to continue to work through me until Jesus comes again. And this is the promise I choose - at this moment - to completely believe and hold on too. A prayer when I am anxious, or scared, or fearful.....    Lord - this is how I am feeling at this moment. You word says that I suppose to "Cast all my cares on You." So here I am Lord. Here are my feelings. I want to give them to You, to cast them on You. I release them to You, and surrender them to Your control. At this moment Lord, I resist my mind, and the enemy, both which are putting fear into my heart. I know I am Your child, and You will protect me and not let me face this battle and these enemies alone. Lord thank you for the love and peace you   will restore upon me. In Jesus’s name - Amen

       At first I saw God as my observer, my judge, keeping track of the things I did wrong, so as to know whether I merited heaven or hell when I die.  He was out there sort of like a president.  I recognized His picture but I didn’t really know Him. But later on when I met Christ, it seemed as though life were rather like a bike ride, but it was a tandem bike, and I noticed that Christ was in the back helping me pedal. I don’t know just when it was that He suggested we change places, but life has not been the same since.  When I had control, I knew the way.  It was rather boring and predictable…it as the shortest distance between two points. But when He took the lead, He knew delightful long cuts up mountains and through rocky places at break – neck speeds; it was all I could do to hang on!  Even thought it looked like madness, He said, “Pedal.” I worried and was anxious and asked, “Where are you taking me?”  He laughed and didn’t answer, and I started to learn to trust.  I forgot my boring life and entered into the adventure.  And when I’d scream, “I’m scared!” He’d  lean back and touch my hand. He took me to people with gifts that I needed; gifts of healing, acceptance and joy.  They gave me gifts to take on my journey, my Lord’s and mine.  And we would be off again.  He said, “Give the gifts away; they’re extra baggage, too much weight.”  So I did, to the people we met, and I found that in giving, I received, and still our burden was light. I did not trust Him at first, to be in control of my life, I thought He’d wreck it; but Jesus knows bike secrets, knows how to make it bend to make sharp corners, knows how to jump to clear high rocks, knows how to fly to shorten scary passages. And I am learning to shut up and pedal in the strangest places, and beginning to enjoy the view, and the cool breeze on my face with my delightful constant companion, Jesus Christ. And when I’m sure I just can’t do anymore, He just smiles and says… ”Pedal.” Author unknown

       One night I was alone and heartbroken, in pain and torment.  I couldn’t seem to make my life work, no matter how hard I tried.  I didn’t have the right skills.  I never learned how to play with other people.  I didn’t fit in, no shape or form.  I felt alone, an outcast, a person with no hope.  No hope at all It seemed like I always ended up hurting and destroying the people I loved.  Or people would hurt me.  My mind and my emotions ran so fast each day; I would be exhausted just from running after them.  Nothing they did made sense.  I was down and out and I started to cry…and cry…and cry…. I must have cried myself to sleep because the next thing I knew I was lying in a beautiful meadow, with flowers all around me and butterflies dancing in the breeze.  The sky was the prettiest blue, I felt I must have died and went to heaven, it was so beautiful, so perfect, and so unlike anything I was use too.  I was going to get up and go explore this magical land that I had suddenly found myself in, but when I tried I couldn’t move!  I was tied to the ground with chains all over my body.  When this sunk in, I started to scream and scream.  When my throat got so sore from the screaming and when my ears couldn’t take the noise anymore, I just started to moan.  No tears left in me to cry, no voice left in me to scream. When I was totally exhausted and on the verge of just totally giving up, a shadow fell over my face.  I tried to look up at whoever it was, but all I could see was the outline of a man, but I could not identify anything else.  The sun was too bright or something - I really wasn’t sure.  I did however manage to whisper, “Please help me sir.” Then this figure kneeled down beside me.  I still could not make out any features, but after I heard the voice, where it was coming from didn’t matter.  The voice was so kind, so soothing, so like a gentle stream flowing over some rocks.  I instantly felt a peace I had never felt before.  It took me a couple of seconds to get beyond the voice to the words that were spoken. “I see your heart is broken.  Why?” the voice said. I replied in a whisper because that was all I had left, “I don’t like my life. I can’t figure it out.” And the voice replied, “In all your ways acknowledge me and I will make your paths straight.   I will direct your steps if you allow me.  Will you,” the soothing voice asked?   I nodded, oh yes I thought.  I was sure the voice couldn’t screw up my life as much as I had.  And you know what happened when I nodded.  I felt the chains on my feet just dissolve.  Then were gone in a heartbeat, no noise to show they had been unchained, and no keys dangling.  I didn’t know quite what to make of this, but before I could think of it much the voice said,  “I still feel hurt in your heart.  What else do you need my child?”    I again whispered, “I just don’t feel I am able to handle my life.”  And that awesome, wonderful, kind voice said, “I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.  I am that Him.  Do you believe,” I was asked? I whispered I would like too.  And more bonds were gone. There’s more,” the voice said ever so soft and comforting.  “More that is troubling you.” “Yes there is,” I whispered.  “I am not wise.  In fact I am really stupid when it comes to life and people.” The voice was strong and yet peaceful and it said, “I will give you wisdom.  Listen to me with your heart & soul.  Can you do that?” “Sure” I said, and even more bonds seem to come off.How long this went on I am not really sure.  I would come up with a reason why I was chained to the ground.  It would be some sort of hurt, or reason why I couldn’t go on.  And each time the voice with love coming out of every sound, would give me reasons why I should go on.  Like when I said I was unlovable.  The voice replied that I was made with love and that He loved me.  When I let those words and that voice seep into my soul and start to believe them, even more chains came off.  I was slowly but surely getting free. I said I was frustrated  - that I seemed to always find trouble or trouble would find me, and I worried even when I didn’t have something to worry about – for if I didn’t have nothing to worry about I worried why not.  The voice said and with these words I felt some hope come back into my life “I did not give you fear.  And when you do start to fear and worry, cast all your fears and worries upon me.”  When I said I couldn’t ever forgive myself for the hurts I had caused to others, the voice replied that He had forgiven me and that was the forgiveness I needed to rely on. Talk about chains breaking then!  I also said I was alone, and didn’t have faith in anything except maybe bad stuff always surrounding me.  The voice replied again with love and caring and hope, “I will never forsake you.”   And that superb voice that I was fast falling in love with also told me that He had given everyone a measure of faith.  I just needed to find mine.  When I thought I could, more chains disappeared.  And so on and so on…. My eyelids were heavy – I muttered I was sleepily and could not stay there with the voice even though my heart and soul desired to.  And then the voice, and it sounded right next to my ear said “I will give you rest!” And all the chains were gone and I felt myself starting to drift off the ground and I heard the voice, that magnificent voice I knew had to be God’s say, “Remember my child.  In me, all things are possible.”    And then I awoke.   I opened my eyes and to my disappointment, I was in my home.   My pillow still felt wet from my tears cried, how long ago I didn’t know.  I got up and looked in the mirror, my eyes were red and swollen from the tears that I felt I must have cried a whole lifetime ago.  Yet also in those eyes, I saw a light I hadn’t seen in a very long time if ever at all.  It was a light of hope; of knowing I was loved, of believing in something other than myself.  It was a light of new beginnings.  I know at that point, God had saved my life.  And I fell to my knees and cried out my gratitude at God for his intervention at this most difficult time of my life. So I am writing my story down.  I feel that God saved me to pass His word on.   Besides, it is such a wonderful story.  Who wouldn’t want to hear how God made us with love, that He sent His only son to die for us so we could be free of the sin in the world.  And if that wasn’t enough, He even allows the Holy Spirit to live in us and help guide us!  Yes a wonderful story indeed!! I know that for some that read this, it will be just a story.  For others it might be the beginning of a light of their own in their eyes, of hope and new beginnings.  For others still, it might be a reminder of how much God loves them and how awesome He is.  But most of all, this is a story of just one example of the lengths God will go to return one of His lost sheep to His arms once again.  If you take anything from my story please let it be this: Jesus replied: What is impossible with men, Is possible with God.” Luke 18:27 So when your life gets impossible don’t turn to man and worldly things – they will only let you down and with them the impossible will stay the impossible.  Instead when your life gets out of control, turn to God – and remember He will never let you down or forsake you and in Him:       All things are possible.  VLH 8/1/04

       I have this rope, the rope of my life With lots of chains of different lengths Some are little bity ones Really tiny in fact.    Some are medium Stronger than the tiny ones The weave in and out of the tiny ones And help keep them in line.    Some are large Big and even stronger yet, They too weave out and in Of all the other chains.    And then there are the biggest ones Not very many but a few Nothing can break this chains They are too strong for that.    And in and about and everywhere Are three that hold everything together Stronger than glue they seem like magic They help support the others at all times.    The little ones are the people That just kinda pop in and out of my life The medium ones are the people that That stayed a little longer.    The large ones are the friends That came into my life And helped keep the chains of my life Holding together and never fall apart.    The biggest ones are family And friends who became my family Sisters in Christ are included In these biggest chains.    And the three strong ones, the glue that keeps me together? Well that is really very simple you see But without them my rope would be worthless Just a big pile of dust really, just like my life would be.     First is the Father who created me and loves me always Then the Son who died on the Cross so I could be free And last is the Holy Spirit who lives within me And makes my life complete.
