      .:Rockin' the speakers to:  Love Song  by The Cure    I truly do not understand the purpose of my being here. I just sit in front of this computer all day and type away about meaningless things; and it's not like I'm being paid to be here either. The only reason I can understand why I'm here is because of this: For the past 5 years, I see my parents 6 minutes a day --sometimes even 45 (if you count an evening of dinner or lunch). So being here allows me to spend more "quality" time with them. Personally, I don't see the difference.  I wish there was something more that I can do instead of wasting the day away in this cubic hell hole. I  could  get a job, but my parents won't let me work. Yet it's ironic how they'd rather I work for them. To me, that's just grabbing more cash flow than I already ask for in their very own wallet. Besides, I'm not even the slightest bit interested in the Mortgage business. I have this scary feeling like I'm going to have a sudden outburst, and throw out a humongous rage. I'm suprised how well I'm taking all this in; though, you don't want to be too quiet or you'll end up shooting every one that's in the vicinity. Frightening isn't it?

         Yeah. I find this much more simplistic than Xanga. The crappy part about it all, is the constant uploading of pictures and how they never turn up with you insert their link. And well, this seems more personal because i've been real hesitant with what I write and I don't seem to be as honest because of what people would say. But now... everything is going to be blunt and out in the open. Geez, it almost sounds as if I'm coming out of the closet or something.. but I'm not.. yet. ;) On another note, while we're on the subject of gay people. My best friend, Travis (who's gay) is leaving for the AF, and I'm going to miss him terribly. He's like my soulmate..    Travis, baby, I'm going to miss you so much. Please becareful and come back safe.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are very much like us women when it comes to shopping.&nbsp; In fact, they're much more picky than we are. Like us, they ask, "Does this make my butt look big?" Like us, they say, "Ugh! I can't decide!" Like us, they say, "I don't like how this is so small up here but so big down there" or vice versa.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  It's amazing how much mischief can be caused while your parents are off in LV for 3 days... I didn't do much except go to a barbeque at Justin's house and watch  Bourne Surpremacy  with Patrick at Camera 12 on Sunday; then Monday came along and boy, was that quite a day. I didn't wake up until about a half hour before Bub came to pick me up to go see Anchorman. After the movie, Ollie picked me up around 2ish and headed over to Stanford shopping center, found that there was really nothing there so instead we decided to watch Napoleon Dynamite because of the added scene to the end. How 'bout that.. 2 movies in one day. =P After that spent the night at his place, and..um.. well.. ya know ;-)

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday seemed kind of fast and wasted... I mean, SFSU was great and everything, but after that it just got irritating, maybe it was because there wasn't enough time to be spent well, and well... Albert wanted to go clubbing later in the evening, so it worked out pretty well for him, I guess. After State, we walked over to Taravel and 19th to have pho and some eggrolls. It was rather funny how we found ourselves sitting next to a large round table of burmese men. "STOP EAVESDROPPING!" he said. He turned his head with much eager to listen to what they were saying, but disguised it as though he was just glaring out the window. "YOU STOP EAVESDROPPING!" We both laughed. Yeah, good shit. We weren't really actively listening, but we did manage to pick up parts of the conversation that consisted of shops, socialites, and concubines...yes.. concubines. I didn't realize it at first, but quite a few burmese families are pretty dysfunctional in terms of fidelity and marital relationships. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; We left for downtown to meet up with Ryan and Kristian to go shopping. We arrived there earlier than they did, so Albert and I decided to walk over to Urban and check out some clothes. Under the $10 shelves were some pretty awesome shirts, especially the one that had Lynyrd Skynyrd on it. Sadly, there wasn't a price tag and it wasn't until I took it to the counter to get it checked that it wasn't $10, but it was $14.99. What a tragedy. I decided not to buy it because I didn't want to waste my cash flow too quickly. :sigh: I wanted to buy it soooo bad, though. Oh well, next time around eh? I really wanna go spend some time around Haight;haven't been there in a while.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; We met up with Ryan and Kristian at Border's, then headed over to Men's Macy's. Kristian bought a really sexy black Reaction jacket for about $140; looked very sexilicious on him. Then we went all the way down to the bottom floor to get Albert a nice dress shirt to wear for club. I finally met Christine, Ryan's taken love interest... or was it Kristine.. What do I think of her...All I can say is that she's cute, but I don't know her well enough to make a full analytical judgement about her.On another note, I get to go to see the A's play! LIVE! In an actual stadium! WOOHOO! I'm excited. It's my first baseball game..err.. actually, first game ever! Yup. It'll be fun.

      By Eric Marx Published: July 14, 2004  As the ballroom dancers glided in unison, mirroring each other's pulsating movements to a midtempo Latin beat, a couple in black body-hugging costumes caught the audience's attention.  Screaming "Go 201, go 201," the onlookers cheered the pair on as they whirled across the room in an athletically sensuous display of high leg kicks, grinding hip turns and pirouettes. The couple, one of 24 teams dancing in the preliminary round of a ballroom dancing contest at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, captured second place in the Latin division.     Only the couple's sex — both are men — hinted at controversy. In letting the dancers, Russell Halley and Jorge Guzman, participate in the competition in April, the organizers of the M.I.T. event for the first time permitted two men to dance together at a championship level. Mr. Halley and Mr. Guzman are also pushing against limits set by the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association, which requires that a competing couple consist of a man and a woman.  The two dancers say that the rules are archaic and that they have proved that two men can dance powerfully and still be artistic. Moreover, they ask, if questions of gay identity and inclusion are being engaged in the workplace and in the bonds of marriage, then why not in professional and amateur sport?   "Did you see the people at M.I.T.?" asked Mr. Guzman, 41, a stock trader who has been dancing with Mr. Halley for three years and who both leads and follows. "They were screaming and jumping. They were happy — straight and gay people — because they understood everything that we were doing."   Competitive ballroom dancing is growing in popularity and is even being considered for inclusion as a medal sport at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Among the arguments advocates have used in pushing for its inclusion is that, like ice dancing or paired skating, dance is one of the rare sports where male and female athletes compete together and on equal terms.  For two years Mr. Guzman and Mr. Halley have competed internationally in gay ballroom dance tournaments in Europe. But such competition is virtually nonexistent in the United States, and the two dancers, who live in New York City, say they have neither the time nor the money to keep flying to competitions in Hanover, Munich and London.  "I'd like to have the opportunity to compete," said Mr. Halley, 40, who runs a talent agency that books stylists and makeup artists.  The International DanceSport Federation, which oversees competitive ballroom dancing worldwide, says that allowing all-male couples alters the fundamental nature of the sport.  "Just as the Hopak dancers do not have to start adding other ethnic groups' elements to their dances because to do so would fundamentally contradict what the dance is about, DanceSport does not have to start adding dances about some other relationship," Jim Frasier, who heads the legal commission of the Europe-based federation, wrote in an e-mail message, referring to the Ukrainian folk dance to explain why his organization has sought to restrict same-sex couples.  Citing as an example the pasodoble, a dance based on movements performed during a bullfight with the man in the central matador role, Mr. Frasier added: "It is performed by a man and woman because it is about the relationship between a man and a woman, using the metaphor of the matador and the cape to express one more aspect of the man/woman relationship."  To many Americans, ballroom is still principally a sexually expressive dance hardly associated with the athletic agility and stamina required of sport. It has failed to gain wide media exposure and sponsorship in the United States but nevertheless has increased in popularity over the past 30 years, both at the grass-roots level in communities, colleges and secondary schools and at private dance studios.  The United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association, based in Virginia, has been pivotal to that growth, notably through investment in its Youth and College Network. But many of its college groups are in open revolt against the association's interpretation of the International DanceSport Federation's ruling, although primarily because it would leave scores of women on the sidelines, unable to compete at two of the association's national competitions. (In ballroom dancing, women outnumber men three to one, according to some estimates.)  Nevertheless, many of those interviewed at the collegiate level say they see this as an equal rights issue for gay men and women: thus the invitation to Mr. Halley and Mr. Guzman.

          yes. tis' official. garage sales are shit. never again, do i want to wake up at 7 for 2 days straight just to have people look at our stuff, ask for the price, and leave without buying anything. FILL UP A BAG OF CLOTHES FOR JUST $1!!! was written on a cut--off cardboard and taped to the clothes rack. As was, EVERYTHING ON THIS TABLE $.50. I'd say the only highlights of my weekend was my brother calling and the quarrel between the european man with a cigarette in hand and the anti-smoker freak: "Ya know,you really are a sick son a bitch for polluting our air and our lungs."  Euroman: "Yeah, well if you don't like it then why don't you get the fuck outta here?"  Antismoker: "I hope you go to hell!" Euroman: "Hey! Same to you buddy!"     Anti-smoker walks away flipping the euroman off.  They said lots more, but that was the one part i remembered most... damn, I wish I had a camcorder or something. *shrug* oh well..

           After two days of not leaving the house, I finally caught Nathan at the best time to go to the movies with him yesterday and I finally got to use my VIP Patron ticket at Camera 12. We watched King Arthur which by the way was quite the clever movie. Well, honestly it was like another Troy movie. On the plus side, Keira Knightley; sexy and hot as ever. All I could think about during the movie was how she was able to keep her boobs under those 2-3 inch straps... crazy, dude. After the movie, we headed over to the booze fest at the park on First St. Reggae music filled the air (even though it was mainly the smell of weed), lots of over-legal people savouring the taste of cold Miller beer that was until we saw some people from school, then I thought, "well..um..okay."        As we were walking and talking, Nathan started laughing. I asked him what was so funny, and he told me that he just saw a guy check me out; didn't really know what to make of it except a shrug. About 10-15 minutes later, we decided to leave and take the longer exit to get to the garage because it was less crowded. Again, on the way out, he spotted another guy that was less suttle about checking out my ass: "I passed by him, and I totally saw him at the corner of my eye that he tilted his head and checked out your ass." Again, another shrug and just immediately came to the conclusion that all men that were present were just a bunch drunken hornbags and that haven't had any due to their petty egos that remain isolated and insulated in their pants. Shit, take a fucking picture, dude. It lasts longer. Better yet, go get yourself some porn, vaseline, and a tubesock. That's all you'll ever need anyways.  ...I'll apologize about that later, because right now I'm on my rag and today's my heavy flow day.

         So I was at the salon with my mom yesterday and we were talking about me spending a few weeks in LA with my sibs and the future. When we started talking about the future, she was mentioning how excited she was when she instilled the persuasion of the mortgage business into my brother and sister's heads and how they were going to move up here, I broke in saying how much it would suck for me to be a victim into that business because it's really something I'm not quite interested in. I always felt happier putting myself outside the norm of my family because, well... it's fucking liberating goddamit!     I mean there's that feeling of clarity that rushes to the brain and it... it feel's great. There's no other feeling I'd rather have in the world than the freedom from confusion and everything else that scatters around it. It's not as if I'm striving to be different, I'm striving to find myself who already  is  different, and when you've finally made that self-discovery, doesn't it feel liberating? Doesn't that take off 100 tons of useless meandering thoughts off your back?   Yeah, I thought so too.

         First off...  Napoleon Dynamite was absolutely hilarious. I'd say that was definitely the best comedic film of all comedic films I've watched my entire life. This one definitely tops the charts. Aside from all that, I had a pretty good day with Albert. We went to Valley Fair because he wanted to get some decent black slacks for work and some grub to eat at the food court. We headed towards Downtown to watch of course,  Napoleon Dynamite @ 9:30. Man... I think Napoleon Dynamite would be like the most awesome kid at our school if he went to PHHS. With dance moves like that, I, for sure could run for class president and win the elections. His brother, Kip and Uncle Rico are such jackasses dude. I mean seriously. It's fucking hilarious when Kip hooks up with his internet lover, Lafawnduh though. Haha! We went to Denny's after that for some late night dinner. I really enjoyed being in the company of Albert, we always have something to talk about. It's funny though, most of the conversations revolve around Ryan and his lack of "pimp" skills because he's so damn passive. *shrug* Eh well, what can you do right? A few interesting things (and these are some pretty good traits) about Albert is that he's very passionate about what he talks about, and he's always straight-forward and direct with what he says and he goes by what he says as well. Why can't all guys be like that? Anyway, he's a really cool guy-- not too shabby for a second cousin. But what's sad to say is that he's more of a brother to me than my own biological brother. Not only because of distance, but I mean.. Albert calls and talks to more so often than my own brother. Well, I think I'm about spent. I'm going to go watch Requiem for a Dream now.

         Indie rock! You're my most favourite type of music... Your music channels lots of emotion. On the top it seems simple, but underneath there's always a deep meaning... As your name you're independent from most of music! Stay that way! Good on you! There's so much variation in your style...from deep and thoughtful like The Stills, to happy go lucky like Belle &amp; Sebastian, to dancy and catchy Franz Ferdinand, and back to boogie down Hot Hot Heat and The Rapture...

         You have a mysterious kiss. Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect. And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.

             We painted finally painted our benches today. Can you guess what I painted on my block? You got it! San Francisco baby! I've never been more proud of my city. Afterwards, Kristina, Katie, Diana, Nancy, Juan and I headed over to VF and had lunch at CPK, oh my goodness... the original bbq pizza was mind orgasmic -- it never tasted so good! Sorry Premier, but CPK kicked your ass this time. The garlic chicken was awesome too. Later, Nanc and Juan had to leave so t'was only KKD and me left to walk around the mall. Kristina bought me this awesome top from F21 and now I'm so in love with it! Thanks Kristina! You fucking rock! I totally owe you! I finally figured out my B2S ensemble and I don't care what anyone, especially the authorities say. I'm going to wear that top to school. Fuck the dress code! Why should it matter what we wear when what's really important is that we all graduate with flying colors? I swear, man. Our school is fucking shit, it needs to grow some balls. Anyway, today was just awesome. I've never been more happy with my bench and my top.

        I decided to step outside for a walk because I just felt like I needed to go out somewhere. At first I wanted to see if Amir was around his pad, but apparently he wasn't... Decided to just keep walking, and heard 3 guys yelling out my name from a Pieter's old garage. My my, it was Jason, Cameron, and Christian... haven't seen them for a while. But it was still good to see them. I would've never have guessed that Jason had moved in Pieter's old house. Normally if I ever get bored, that's where I'd usually go -- to see Pieter. Anyway, I went up to the sausage-infested garage, grabbed a chair and chattered away with them.  It was fun... in fact, that's about the highlight of my week so far. Yeah, nothing better than having a discussion about sex and relationships with the guys again... heh.

        urlLink     urlLink                         So Thursday night at GAMH was fucking rad right? 'Course it was! I didn't realize it 'til now but it would've been so much more awesome if Interpol was in lieu of Ambulance Ltd. I mean, I love Amublance Ltd. don't get me wrong. Their shit puts me on a natural high, but not as much as Elefant and Interpol put together. The funniest thing happened during Elefant's set; there was this tall, bald, masculine guy standing in front of Albert. He's jumpin' up and down going absolutely crazy for this band, singing the words to the songs and whatnot... then he puts out his hand reaching to touch Mod's hand, but apparently seems to be wanting to grab his balls instead. Albert and I both detected that the tall, bald, masculine guy was a flamer which came quite an amusement to us because we totally thought he was straight! What a way to conceal his homosexuality. Hah! How did we know this? Allow me to explain, you know if a guy wanted to reach out his hand to touch a member of the band, he'd throw his arm straight out.. yes? Now, if a girl were to throw out her arm, her arm would be slightly twisted and there would be this bump on left side of her arm and somewhat bent on the other. A feminine way of throwing out a hand, rather. Oh! On an additional note, he also kept on flicking his wrist while he had his arm out. Talk about dead giveaways.

      So I was cleaning up my room, separating the wanteds from the unwanteds and came upon an interesting essay I wrote in my English class sophomore year. Though, I don't know if it really makes any sense. The only simple explanation I can give is that I probably wrote it  really  late the night before it was due. Anyway.. there ya have it:   Every day I pass by clusters of people composed of those who generally share the same interests and views. I then see the few strays that flourish far from what is typically "general." Yet I can relate to those social outcast for it almost seems as if my views had been rejected, this I am labeled as a pariah. As I began to walk by the "high maintenance" cliques, there was a "crackling quiet that in itself was an accusation." Lately, I began to realize how I am closely compared to the character of Leonard Mead, in Ray Bradbury's short story  The Pedestrian.  What I can infer about this is that the people that are usually excluded from groups are the ones whose open-mindedness and dynamic views are seen as out of the norm perceptions.

          Okay, the news media has to leave the whole 9/11-Al Qaeda shit alone... Yes, it happened! OH, What a fucking tragic day that was! People don't need to be reminded that their loved ones died every day when they turn on to channel 5 in the morning...
