      I really wanted to go see you today but i would rather plan it out seeing how we are going to risk being able to see each other in the future. I'm sorry you don't belive that i want to go see you. I really do darlin'. I'm not going to see you tomorrow or be able to talk to you much tomorrow so i really wanted to go see you. Its just that i would rather make sure we don't get screwed into not seeing each other by getting caught. I love you i really do and it hurts to hear you say  that you don't think that i love you. I do darlin'. I really do. I'm sorry that i don't show it as much as i should i guess. I try darlin' i do. I am still not used to showing the love i have for you. Anyway i love ou very very very much wheather you belive it or not and i will talk to you later.

       So this post is about my one and only. He is the sweetest guy I have ever known. I love him with all my heart, and I always will. We are going to move away in about a year, get married at some point, have kids, and get house so it can be OUR home. I'm so excited, I can't wait. I love you and he loves me. Well I guess thats enough for now. Just had to try this thing out. Later.

      So darlin' i'm sorry but tomorrow i go fishing in the see. We are going up to plum island. We are leaving around ten in the morning and getting back not too late. the last time sucked because nobody caught any fish. I'm going to miss you very much darlin and will take your little bear with me to keep me company. I will try like hell to catch a fish for you even though you don't do seafood. I would like for you to come with me but i don't think you would like it very much seeing how we would be on a not so big boat in the ocean tryiong to catch things you don't like. Its cool when you actually catch something but not so cool when you spend hours sitting there and catch absolutely nothing. I love you darlin' an di wish i could be with you rather than spending the day on a fishing trip. I want to make you happy i really do. Anyway, darlin' i am going to end it here. So i love you oodles of oodles and i will tlak to you later.

       So, today was boring. Except when MY sweety came and visited me at work. I was quite excited to see him. I hadn't seen him in a couple of days. He bought me a leomonade. :)  I love that boy. I got to spend my break with him. I was happy. I probably won't see him again until Friday when he will hopefully come see me at work again. He's such a sweety boy, so good to me! Anyways, thats it. I love you sweety! MUAH!!!

      So i am going to the orhtodontist today for a 3:10 appointment. I get my braces off soon. My girlfriend realy likes my braces for some reason. I don't understand it. she probably likes them becasue they are on me and not on her. anyway i will be gone for a while. when i get back i am going to take a bike rid eto her work and visit her. Its only a few miles and itsgood excersize. Its about a 20 minute ride each way. My braces come off on my next appointment i belive. This is just the checkup before the big one. It'll be wierd kissing her without braces but i am suer i am gooing to like it just as much. I have only kissed her with braces so far. Anyway, iam going to end it here. So i love her very much and will see her later.

        So I have been waiting for you to come home since like 5pm. I hope youre home soon. I asked dad about the movie he said we can go. The movie is at 5:15 so he will have us at the theatre for 5. He also said I can go back to your house after the movie until 9:30. Not the greatest but its better than nothing. So I really hope you come back soon. I did call your house, but of course you weren't home. I wouldn't mind if you still called me when you got home, but I suppose it doesnt matter. dad isn't too excited about letting me go to the movies, but he will live. So we did have a cookout today. And never once was I told I could invite you. So I don't know what is going on with these people. So Rissa came and brought 6 of her friends. Fun for me huh. Yeah. Right. It wasn't too bad, I actually didn't feel too much like an outsider because I was invited to like play games with them and what not. It was kind of fun. I still would have had a better time if you had been there. I wish I wasn't working Saturday. I would like to have you over here for the day or something. There is this game Cranium that I have grown to love, and I want us to play sometime, that is with another 2 people also. So therefore probably my dad and Dale. Although they would probably be gay and not play because it would be playing with us. And they bitch if we aren't social with them but they don't have to be social with us. But whatever. I want to play it with you sometime while you are here. It is a really fun game. Anyways, I'll stop now. This has gotten pretty long. So I love you oodles of oodles. And you better get home soon! MUAH! I love you sweety.

It's just about "before dark". So I love you oodles of oodles of oodles! MUAH! Come home soon! I love you sweety.
