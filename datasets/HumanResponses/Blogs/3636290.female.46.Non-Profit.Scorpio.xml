      Date 5/16/04  MORNING TO 12 NOON H woke up @ 8AM and quietly turned on the TV.  He was in a good mood. We visited the Animal Shelter  (url: http://www.nashelter.org) H indicated that he would like to volunteer. He was eager to help out, and even picked up a mop and helped mop the floor!  After that we walked one of the dogs, Danny. The visit was cut short because the Animal Control Officer had to go out on a call, but we agreed to go back in 2 weeks and visit/volunteer again.  AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM We walked at a local nature trail/fish hatchery.  H was upset because we forgot the bug spray, but walked the nature trail anyway.  H was very worried about Jack getting “loaded with ticks”, but I told him Jack gets special meds to stop ticks from getting on him. (url: http://www.fws.gov/r5cneafp/nattleboro.htm)  After our walk it rained so the rest of the afternoon was spent watching movies.  He was unhappy to learn the parental controls on the TV block pg13 movies, he spent some time trying (unsuccessfully) to figure out how unlock the code. I told him PG13 movies have to be evaluated individually for content. He argued that he was old enough to watch PG13 movies; I reiterated 11 is not old enough for a movie rated for a 13 year old without supervision.   EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM While packing to leave H jumped up on the top bunk and broke one of the slats on the bed.  He prefers to sleep on the top bunk and argued when told he’d have to use the bottom bunk until we get the top bunk fixed.  He insisted that he can’t sleep on the bottom bunk, and how horrible it is.  He refused to accept that he should not sleep on the bunk with a broken slat.   Next weekend we will work on ways to fix the bed, and reasons why it isn’t appropriate to jump on the bed (i.e. safety, appropriate behavior, respect for property)   Summary:  H has a very positive attitude, and is always eager to help.  He can be stubborn at times, but usually listens to reasonable explanations.  He participates in all planned activities, and enjoys making future plans.   He is asking to spend more time here, and has asked about coming over on Friday nights, and spending more time on school holidays.

      Child:   H	 Today’s Date:  5/15/04	Day of Week: Saturday Proctor Parent:    Zulu   MORNING TO 12 NOON Picked Him up at Walker @ 10AM for his first overnight visit.  The morning’s activities included a short visit to a local firehouse museum followed by some yard work at the house. He was very helpful, and in a very good mood.  He loved the museum, and was happy to hear that we would go there for a longer visit soon.  AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM We spent most of the day at the house, watching movies, and cooking out.  At one point He said he was “bored out of his mind” because we were watching a movie, Brother Bear, he had already seen.  However, I had asked him before putting the movie in if he had seen it and I’m sure he said he had not.  I’m still scratching my head over that one!  J  I’ve noticed HE has a heightened fear of all bugs with a specific fear of ticks.  Even with repeated doses of Cutter bug repellant he continued to swat & scratched at his legs and insisting I check his scalp for ticks.  In the house he got down on his hands and knees and looked under the baseboard heaters and was upset that he found some dead bugs under there.    EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM After dinner, we took a long walk with Jack (the dog), along the way we met up with several people also walking their dogs.  HE was outwardly very social, but also made some negative comments about others his own age.  At one point, while walking thru a local cemetery, 3 children were walking a dog and playing around the gravestones.  HE mentioned that he thought the girl was “choking her dog” because the dog was pulling on the lead. I explained to him that it was the dog that was pulling the girl, not the girl choking the dog.  He also mentioned that the kids shouldn’t be playing on the gravestones, which I had to agree with!

      Well, as a former dog officer I take these things seriously...  Tonight after picking up my foster son for the weekend, on the way home I nearly hit a dog the was running around all over the neighborhood and criss crossing a street where people drive quite fast.  I get out to help the dog (not seeing a owner anywhere) and after about 1/2 hour of trying to get this dog, this guy comes up to me and says "is there some reason why you are trying to catch my dog?"     Ummm..Yeah..your dog nearly ran under my car you freak'n twerp!

      My garbage man left me a nasty note today stating, "leave garbage out by 7:00 AM this is my 2nd trip by"   I didn't realize my garbage was such a high priority!  What a life.

      AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM Additional Notes about Hiss reaction to being close to former pre-adoptive home: When I initially asked H why he wanted to take a specific path through the woods to see the pre-adopt. family’s house, he blurted out “because I hate them and I want to annoy them”  then quickly added “I don’t hate them, I was just curious to see if them still live there.”

      Today’s Date:  5/8/04 Picked Henry up at his temp residence @ 9AM.  He presented me with Mother’s Day gifts (roses, a book & handmade card J )  He was very excited to come to the house for the first time.  He was in a good mood, and very talkative.  The morning’s activities included a visit to Petsmart to see the cats in the catroom.  Henry enjoyed seeing all the dogs and cats there.  We also visited my son’s home, where Henry met my Son, his wife and daughter.  The visit went very well, and we invited them all over for a cookout.   After arriving back home we walked with the dog to the library.  Henry got his own Library card and he is very happy about that.  He even chose a book to take home with him for the week.  NOTE: As we walked to the library he tried repeatedly to get me to let him use a path through nearby trees to “see what was there.”  I suspected there was a reason he wanted to go down this path, and later found out that he believes that the path leads to the backyard of his former pre-adoptive family.  Due to the details he gave, I believe his previous family lives approx 3 blocks away.  I talked to him about respecting their privacy and keeping appropriate boundaries, and he agreed not to go there again.  I suspect curiosity will eventually get the better of him.   We had a cook out with my son & his family.  He talked sports with my bio-son, and everything went smoothly.  He helped me set the table, and helped clean up afterwards.   We had a very nice day, and he was falling asleep in the car on the way back.  He was dropped off back at his temp rez House @ 7PM  We agreed that next weekend we would have an overnight visit.  I will be picking Him up around 10:00 Sat. morning and return around 6PM Sunday night.

      MORNING TO 12 NOON I met H @ 9AM to accompany him to a day at an amusement park with the other school grads.  H lives in  a residential school for special needs kids.   We arrived at the park @ 10AM and went into the park.  We spent the rest of the morning getting our brains scrambled in various ways.  J     AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM We had a lot of fun at the amusement park.   After arriving home H helped me give Jack (the dog) a bath.  We spent the rest of the night watching TV and doing crafts.   EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM H woke up in the middle of the night and stated he had a bad dream.  He claimed that a man came in the house and said he needed some of H’s underclothes (H just got new socks and underwear.)  He went on to say the man went into the kitchen and started taking food.  H claims that in his dream he told the man to, “get the f***” out of the house.”  In the morning H thought that talking me was a part of the He dream.  In fact, he was sitting up in bed, eyes open, and speaking very clearly.   H has some general fears about going to bed. He always insists that the lights be on, and the door be wide open.  I have been working on reassuring him that this is a safe place for him, and he need not be scared.  I’ve been told that this is common in abuse cases, and is known as “hyper vigilance.”    It never occurred to me but bedtime can be a threatening thing to a sexually abused child.
