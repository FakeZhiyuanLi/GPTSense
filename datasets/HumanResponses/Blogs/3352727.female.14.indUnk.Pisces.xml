      Today was a better day then yesterday. I realized the beauty of spending the whole day in my PJs while vegging out and watching my favorite Disney movies. However, that's usually how I spend my entire summer vacation when I'm not going anywhere; loads of fun.  If you were curious (which I'm sure you weren't, but oh well) the divorce is continuing. My stepdad is out of the house for a couple days and my mom is happy. Since she's happy, I'm happy, so we're all one big happy family. I think I'll stop posting about the divorce too because it's really no one else's business, but I just kind of felt like sharing yesterday since it was basically the only thing on my mind.   Let's see... what else can I say? Hm... My brother is going back east to New Hampshire to visit his grandparents and other family members. It's weird because he hasn't been over there in about 2 years, so it's going to be kind of lonely here without him. Oh well, 2 weeks will go by fast.  Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      I first got the idea to start my own blogger website from my brother, and received everything that was necessary to begin my posts, but was too lazy. I thought that today would be a good day to start.  A new turnpoint in my life has started, one that has hit me hard. My mom and my stepdad are divorcing, and it has caused turmoil in my head. So much is going to change, and I don't want it to happen. Even though I'm not moving to a different state (like I have many times in my life before), it's still different. The family that I have learned to love is going to be torn apart, and it's all too much for me to handle. I found out that I can't cry anymore, since I just tried a second ago, teary eyes and that was about it. Don't get me wrong though, I'm not depressed, just... um... shocked, and apparently I don't take great amounts of shock too well. I'll get through it though, I always do.  On a happier note, I finished watching Tuck Everlasting (a movie that I haven't seen in a LONG time) a little while ago, and I developed a new favorite quote:  "Do not fear death, fear the unlived life."  Great quote...   Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      Since I have nothing better to do, I might as well do a blog. However, I don't have anything to say. Very sad indeed. Well... since I'm already here I might as well ramble about random crap. I leave for my dad's on Wednesday. Wait... that means I have to pack tomorrow! *grumble* Anyway. I'm going to be gone for two weeks. Whoopteedoo. I want to go, but I don't want to go, you know? I don't know why, but going to my dad's is getting rather boring. I feel bad for saying that, but it's true. I love my dad, don't get me wrong, but we have nothing in common. I don't like the same shows as him (which gets really annoying because he only has one TV), he's obsessed with classic rock (which I have no problem with, but having him question me about who the band that is singing everytime a new song comes on gets rather annoying), he's very organized when it comes to money, he's obsessed with cameras and computers... and I could probably go on for quite a while. Oh well, when we go visit all of our family friends it'll be worth it. But I'm getting away from Evyn, so that's a major plus.  Random Comment: I'm starting to like some rap and it's scaring me.   Until we meet again, I bid you aieu.

      It's 1:30am on Sunday, June 27th and I'm wired. Amy, Michelle, and Rhyan are over and I'm high on caffeine. Since I'm not going to get to sleep for another couple hours because of the caffeine and the blasting music, I decided to make a blog. The only problem is I don't really have anything to say. Hm... Oh yes. My ideas on lowering my cholesterol by eating Honey Nut Cheerios is out the window. I didn't have any today and I ate pounds of pizza, cheetos, and fritos for the past couple hours. Hehe. Oh well, it was delicious. Okay, this was mainly created so I could waste about 5 minutes. Guess what? It worked! So... I guess that's all that I have to say for now.  Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      My summer still seems uneventful, but it's going fast. I haven't been doing anything at all, but it's almost over for me. I know it's not even July yet, but the rest of my summer is over already. I leave for my dad's on Wednesday which puts a halt to my paradise. The latest he is going to let me sleep in is 8 (complete torture), and when we go to Red Bluff, Kirk (a family friend) is going to want to wake me up earlier than that just to spite me. We're going to do some fun things while there too, but it's pretty much the same stuff that happens every year, except we're going to the aquarium this time (YES!). After I get back from that, I have four days until band camp starts. Now that's really going to absorb most of my time. And it's not only going to be time consuming, it's going to kill me. Being forced to do certain exercises that I am not capable of doing is bad enough, but add being in 100 degree weather has "RIP" written all over it. So I would suggest saying your good-byes to me now.  However, I'm still determined to live the remaining days until Wednesday to their fullest. Take right now for example. It's 10:06pm, and I'm sitting at the computer, still in my swimsuit from swimming a little while ago, and eating Honey Nut Cheerios out of the box because I'm too lazy to pour it into a bowl with milk. But hey, since I have nothing better to do, I might as well try to lower my cholesterol.  Random Comment: I am now obsessed with Maroon 5's "Songs About Jane" CD.   Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      Well, my blogs have been extremely boring because nothing worth talking about has happened to me lately. It's been a while since I created an entry, so I guess I'm making one now. I re-read my previous blogs today, and realized how non-interesting my life is. In words I am a rather dull person, and I possess no pictures that are worthy of adding life to this bland site of mine. So, for those of you who are reading this right now, I suggest you get a life and find something better to do then read these worthless words that I am typing. However, you shouldn't be taking anything I say personally because out of all of the people in the world (besides my brother) I need a life desperately. For the past 2 or 3 weeks (however long school has been out) I have been sitting in front of the TV or the computer (a screen of some sort) wasting daylight in my PJs and eating about half of my body weight in snacks with no nutritional value whatsoever. The only thing that gets me out of the house is band or going to the gym (which is a complete loss when I spend the rest of the days eating non-stop). As I am trying to say, I'm bored constantly and have no imagination to use that can help me spend my days wiser. I sleep in until 10 everyday, so I miss the cool mornings and the sunrises; things that I don't think that I have ever seen or felt during the summer time. Then I am up passed midnight, still in front of a screen of some sort because I can't sleep after sleeping in passed ten and drinking caffeine from the sodas that are my liquid source of the day (although I have to go somewhere else to get them since my mom only buys caffeine free). But can you really blame me? I was suffering in school for 9 months (with the occasional breaks) from sleep deprivation and work overload, even though that was partly because I am a procrastinator. After 9 long months I finally have the freedom to sleep as long as I want and put everything off as long as possible because it isn't important. I have about one more week left of that, but I can't help but think that this shouldn't be what summer is all about. My entire life has always consisted of trudging through school just so summer vacation could roll by me. My tradition has always been to be as lazy as possible because I don't get that chance during the school year. Either I am just plain crazy because now I think otherwise, or I'm growing up (which scares me). Whatever the case is, I'm still confused. I feel like I want to pitch in, but my body is in relax mode (since it knows what time of year it is) and stops me from doing anything. Oh well. No one said life was easy, right? I always overreact, and I'm sure that this is one of those times, but it is still a challenge for me. I know one thing is for sure, I never get a break from thinking.   Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      Doing laundry all days isn't really the most exciting way to pass the time; I figured that out today. However, it needed to be done. I REALLY needed to sort through the clothes that didn't fit me anymore. Hehe. Yep, you really needed to know that. How about a different update? I could get used to this new life of mine. Sure it has it's points that completely suck, but that happens, right? And it's summer anyway, so it's not like my life is going to be normal anyway. I'll just have to wait until school (ACK!) starts again to see if it will be completely adaptable. Aw who am I kidding? I'll adapt, even when school (ACK!) starts it won't be the same because high school (ACK!) is going to be really different. I need to stop thinking about school (ACK!), it's a horrible thought to think about when there is still valuable summer time to spend thinking about nothing. Okay then... New subject.   Sparkling apple cider is really good. I wonder if it is possible to get high off of it... Well, it has a lot of sugar (last time I checked) so I guess it's possible. Good thing that it's alcohol free, hehe. Anyway...  Random Comment: I'm addicted to Yellowcard's "Ocean Avenue" CD.  Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      I am officially moved out of my house of 5 years. That is the longest that I have ever stayed in one house, and it feels weird that I don't live there anymore. This apartment could turn into a home for me, but it still isn't the same. My pets aren't here, and from what it looks like, I don't think we're bringing them with us; it would be too hard for them to adapt. My brothers aren't happy. My little brother is still pissed at my mom for divorcing his father, which isn't very reassuring for my mom. And my older brother... well he is pretty much deprived of everything important to him right now, and from what I have seen, it isn't the best feeling in his point of view. But there are 2 upsides. Besides my brothers being depressed, my mom is very glad to be out of the house. I'm glad that she is happy. And my new room is bigger than my old one. Even though it doesn't have the millions of shelves that my old room contained, which is causing me to keep most of my things in boxes, it's okay. Oh well, it can only get better, right? I hope so, because this whole experience has been a real blow to my family and we weren't ready.   Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      I have been so lazy with submitting entries. Hehe. Oh well, I'll try not to let that happen again. But there really was no reason for me to submit any entries because my life has been rather boring. Besides preparing for marching band, I have only been listening to Yellowcard non-stop. I got the CD Tuesday night and because I have had nothing better to do, I have been listening to it over and over, so now I know all of the words to most of the songs. Yay for me!. Anyway... The marching band clinics started today, and I'm already intimidated. The music is a lot harder then I am used to, but I guess that's good because it will challenge me. I am renting a new clarinet though, which is really cool. Anything that is new is always fun to play with (but in this case, just play). But I know that this challenging music will require A LOT of practicing, so that will probably occupy most of my time for a while.  Sunday is the big day for me. I have barely started packing (which I am sure is going to come back to haunt me within the next 3 days) and it's coming too soon. Turns out that we're only taking one computer with us, and since my mom is CONSTANTLY on the computer, I won't be on as often. But that is a good thing because I won't be spending endless hours sitting on this chair in front of a screen wasting my life away. Okay... I know that's dramatic, but it's true. That'll give me more time to use the pools and the gym at our new apartment complex. So I guess that it's a good thing that we're only taking one computer.  Until we meet again, I bid you adieu.

      I always hoped that eventually life would run out of things to throw, or become bored... Oh how wrong I was. It's a never ending wheel that just keeps turning. No, I'm not trying to become some deep philosopher and preach to everyone about how they need to be prepared for everything that comes out of life because it is surprising. I'm just gonna say this one simple comment: "It's not easy."  My life has been one big adventure as one of my friends says. Something is always happening to me and it is never boring. Well sure, a lot of things happen to me, but it sucks after a while. If I remember her e-mail correctly she said "you have a boyfriend, you move constantly, there is always some kind of war going on in your family, you live in a huge city and so many things happen to the people around you, your life is never boring." Oh ho ho.... It may be exciting, but most of it sucks as I have said before. I am taken on a roller coaster constantly, and it never seems to end. I have my ups and downs, but my downs usually don't last for a while. Don't think that I'm depressed or suicidal or anything like that, it's just something that I have realized lately. I wouldn't trade my life for anything, but it would be nice to not have so many heart-wrenching experiences happen to me. Anyway... I just felt like adding that since I think that's what kept me up past midnight last night.  Dan left this morning. Yeah, kind of sad, but it's summer right? People are leaving. I will soon be joining them.  1 week, 2 days and counting. My mom and I are moving into our new apartment. Exciting, no? Just adds more to what I was saying earlier. I have to start packing this weekend... *grumble* I hate packing. But it'll be fun to unpack everything in my new room, that's pretty much the only thing that I like about moving. That and seeing my room empty, that makes it fun to just lay down in because it's so peaceful. It'll be that time again soon.  That's it for now! Until we meet again, I bid you adieu!  (I hope that is getting annoying, it's fun to bug people sometimes, hehe)

      My day has been devoted to love for some peculiar reason. I started it off by watching Moulin Rouge. If you have seen it, you will know that it has a beautiful love story. I don't know why, but that just put me in a good mood, even though Satine dies in the end. Maybe because it's a musical and had a lot of music and flashing lights that's what put me in a good mood, but I don't think that's it. It starts off by saying one of my favorite quotes: "The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return." Isn't that awesome? I have no idea why, but I LOVE that quote. Whenever I hear it, I'm always in a good mood, so I'm glad that I watched that in the morning. For the rest of the day, my little brother and his friends were fighting and screaming bloody murder at each other, but I didn't really care. I was really happy and hyper today, and my little brother has never gotten me down before. I also went on a quick bikeride (only half an hour) to get out excess energy... I haven't ridden my bike in forever and I have forgotten how fun it was. Then I talked to my friends all day, which always makes me happy. So... I am just rambling on and on about how good my day was today. You really didn't need to know all of that did you? Oh well, this is an online journal, so I am emptying my thoughts into it. Hey, you came here willingly, hehe.  Should I be feeling happy when my house being torn apart? Well, my answer to that is "yes." Why not see the bright side of everything that is happening? I was so depressed already, I'm sick of it. Hm... I guess that's why I'm one of those hyper/happy people, I can't stand being depressed. Oh well, I'm typing what I'm thinking again and not making any sense. COOL! Anyway... I think that's all that I have to say, I don't really have anything else that happened today that was the least bit important (that I haven't already mentioned, hehe). So... yeah....  Until we meet again, I bid you adieu!  ( Yes, I'm going to start saying that at the end of each of my entries, I think it sounds cool. )

      Well, it's been a while since I have posted a blog. The reason for this is simple: band camp.&nbsp; Band camp is.... uh.... interesting. I have only had it for 3 full days (not including the 2 half days that we had Tuesday and Wednesday) and I am totally exhausted. You have no idea how happy I was when I got home last night because today is our day off. PARTY! Yeah... It's really not THAT bad in some parts. We are there almost all day, which is kind of exhausting. However, 9-12 and 1-4 aren't that bad. We are doing only rehearsals 9-12, and then 1-4 we are mixing going into the dance room to practice marching, or doing more rehearsing. All of that is actually pretty cool, I just need to practice the music a little more. Then there is 6-9. WOW. Those 3 hours completely exhaust me until I feel like crying. We are outside during those 3 hours and it is extremely tiring. Okay, now I'm making it sound worse than it really is. My only problem is that my body was not ready for any of that, so I just recently discovered what it is like to have every part of my body ache (not the best feeling). So! Today I am going to do absolutely nothing (well... I still need to practice the music) since that is really all that I am capable of since I have trouble completing a simple task such as walking down the hall into my room. Oh well. Just one more week and it's over!!!!!!!!!!!   Now, back to a previous topic. Band camp has been enough to get my mind off of EVERYTHING. Since I have to continuously concentrate on what I am doing while at band camp, I haven't had very much time to think about everything that is going on at home, and it is keeping me away from home most of the day so I do not have to experience anything either. So in a way, band camp has been a good thing. It not only drastically improves my marching and how I play our show music, it occupies my mind for a while. Interesting....   Well, that's it for now. I probably won't post another blog until band camp is over.   Until we meet again, I bid you adieu!

      Well, I'm back from my dad's, something that I'm happy about. The only problem is that I am right back in my life that I had gotten away from for 2 weeks. I wanted to come home badly, but I had no idea what I was wishing for exactly. Summer vacation is almost over and band camp starts really soon. Yeah, that sounds really pathetic if that is all that I am complaining about, so it continues. This divorce business is majorly screwing up my life. Well, not really MY life in particular, but my family's life (so that does include me). My little brother is still majorly pissed at my mom for divorcing his dad, and&nbsp;that's probably not going to change for a while. He refuses to stay at our apartment for long because he doesn't want to be with my mom anymore. He's seven years old and has always been a total mommy's boy, but now... *poof* he despises her. This is totally crushing my mom, which is really wounding me. For those who did not know, my mom used to smoke, and I mean for a LONG time. I think it was last January when she had decided to quit because she was sick of it and had been smoke free ever since. So yesterday, I come home from the airport, sit on the recliner after popping in a CD, and what do I see on the table next to me? A carton of cigarettes. With my mom being only 4 feet away from me, I brought it to her attention that I had seen the carton laying right there in front of my face. "I've only had 2," she said calmly. 2?!?!?!?! (*#&amp;*&amp;#^$&amp;*^# *(%&amp;^$*&amp;^ *sigh* And then today I was looking at the pictures that my dad took while he was here for graduation, and I almost started crying. There was this picture of our non-broken family and we all looked happy. Even was smiling so big that I couldn't believe that he had looked that in the past. This picture was taken at Scotty's graduation; a Thursday night. That Thursday was 2 days before this all started and we had no idea what was in store for us. I still constantly wonder what I would be doing right now if my mom hadn't filed for divorce and we hadn't moved out of the house. Wow, what a change that would be. To pull an old line: Oh woe is me. Another thing that bothers me is that I still believe that ice cream and potato chips will make me feel better. Didn't work. Been there, done that, and now I'm 10 pounds heavier in the end. I need to find a new way to find comfort.  &nbsp;  Final Thought: I want school to start; I NEED something to occupy my mind.
