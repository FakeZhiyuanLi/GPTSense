						   Happy fourth of July.  I think it will rain. I hope my girls still get to see the fireworks. That's about all I want for today. I don't really drink anymore so I won't be partying with friends. It almost sucks to never do anything fun. I spend day in and day out raising my daughters. Now don't get me wrong I love being a mother, it's the best thing in the world. I am proud that I am the type of mother that I am. There are the times though, in the very back of my mind that I think...I am only 26 years old, I should be having more fun than this. My friends call me a hermit. I don't mind. Most of the time I like to be home by myself anyway. Sometimes I like to be around people too. I guess I am closest to a chameleon, I adapt to my surroundings. What bothers me a little I guess is that I do not have the adult time I am seeking. I don't even sleep in my bed alone, most mornings when I wake up, I wake up to 3 children in my bed with me. It's not a big deal. Here's the deal, I love my children, I love every minute with them. I guess nostalgia is getting the best of me here lately. I shouldn't complain. So today is the 4th and I will get up, make breakfast, clean my house, maybe watch some tv, cook supper and take my girls to see the fireworks, I will then come home, clean my house again and go to bed. Of course I left out the bathing, feeding the animals, the diapers that will need changing, punishments that will be handed out. The cat will probably choke up a hair ball and the dog will chew up something of importance, the bird will flick out about 2 cups worth of bird seed onto my floor. My oldest daughter will make fun of my middle daughter, my middle daughter will attempt to make a bird out of what I sure once was a lot of water, dirt and a pepsi can, and my baby girl will, at some point call another country, pull some hair out of the cat, eat something that should not be eaten, reset the time on my vcr,drag all of her toys in to my living room, throughout the day will attempt to put on every shoe in the house, will climb on the kitchen table, the toy box, the coffee table, the toilet, and the computer desk and I will cherish my bottle of aleve, and sometimes wish they were vicoden. Here's the best part of all, Their father who works midnights will then wake up, and proceed to tell me how lazy I am and how bad I suck because some laundry wasn't folded and the bathroom floor wasn't mopped. I love my life! I just wish it was different.

						   When a friend asks you to analyse their dreams what do you say? If they say "hey, I had a really weird dream, what does it mean"? It puzzles me that someone thinks that I may have some insight on their subconscience mind. When I hear someone say "I had a weird dream" I think "hey, welcome to my world". I've never had a normal dream, not while asleep anyway. Don't tell me about the dream you had about the neighbor getting the newspaper in his underwear because chances are if that had been my dream he would have been riding a camel with a purple beret and would not have been a newspaper he was after it would have been a flying roast beef sandwich.  I don't buy into all the Fruedian sexuality bullshit. I suppose if you looked at something long enough you could find sexuality issues.  I don't know my friend any better after hearing her dream, it was a dream for gods sake. I don't know what it means and if I ventured a guess I'm sure it would be wrong. I tend to be a deep person and my friends recognise that. What they tend to overlook is that I do not have the answers to most things they're looking for, hell I don't have the answers to 75% of what I'm looking for.
