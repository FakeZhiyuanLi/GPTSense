      haiz... today's  Nationals  sucked  ....so bad! man.. we  beat HCJC  which sent SR and YJ  trembling  but not RJ. sadly, we lost to RJ. wad was worst was that  we lost to SR and YJ!!!!!!!!!!   argh!!!!!!!!  i had confidence we could beat them... we   could   have been in the semi finals... though i dun think we'll get third(cos SA, AC and RJ will get top 3) but we can at least be fourth than  nothing!!     but anyway,  good game guys.  i only played the RJ game... it is like  defense  all the way... they are very good. SA and AC's match was more like a  real  rugby game. very nice to see em play... i wished i could've play the YJ match... wanna let out some  fury  and give'em a  bashing .. hands itching for a   faceoff  ... haiz.. nvm got next time friendly.  gonna work hard. i wanna play in more matches.. anyway, i'm really tired now so i am gonna rest update again later. tonight got bbq again.. eternity production thingy.. haha... so come back later and check out my blog see ya!
