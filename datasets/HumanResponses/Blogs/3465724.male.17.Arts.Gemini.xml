       was wondering around the net and I came to this IQ test thing.   urlLink The IQ test   nothing much reliable actually. but it is not completely senseless after all there are rezones that some people do certain things logically faster, or ( not related to IQ ) memorize numbers easily while I’m having trouble memorizing my home's phone number.  Oh I searched the web and it said :   Below 30	>1% 30 to 50	>1%? 50 to 60	~1%? 60 to 74	3.5%? 74 to 89	20% 89 to 100	25% 100 to 111	50% 111 to 120	15% 120 to 125	5% 125 to 132	3% 132 to 137	1% 137 to 150	0.9% 150 to 160	0.1% 160 to 174	0.01% 174 to 200	0.0099%  Hmmm 174 to 200. Albert’s Einstein’s was more than 200. wow, now THAT IS high.

      Some security tips from me :  Remember. If you don’t care about your computer’s security and spam, it’s not only your business, you may harm your friends too cause their email address is  stored in your computer.   Logical steps you have to take:  1st: You didn’t ask for it (email, file , photo … ) ? don’t open it. That program looks interesting? Make sure it comes from a trusted source. not that a friend sent it, go figure out who made it, also take a look at it’s user agreement. Sometimes it says things like out software is allowed to monitor your activity and stuff…   2nd: I say this for the last time : NO YAHOO OR MSN OR   IS NOT GOING TO BE CLOSED IF YOU DON’T FORWARD THAT MESSAGE. Please don’t believe in these scam messages. And NO if you add a user named   your computer is not going to be hacked or what ever.  3rd: watch out for Trojan horses. These cheap software are easy to use and very stealthy if you don’t have anti-virus. Any idiot can download a version of them ( I’m not going to name them cause I know certain people can read it off right from here and go search in Google for it) and bound a file with it and sent it to you. These viruses or as some call it back-doors let the one who sent it do a variety of operations that seriously can hurt you privacy. Any thing from reading all your key strokes, downloading your files, getting screen shots of your computer, deleting- adding files and worse of all listing to your room’s sounds via mic. Or even watching you in web cam without you noticing it.   4th: You are using Kazza? Uninstall it . yeah uninstall Kazza and go pay for music Instead . if you use Kazza for downloading illegal software such as free games, remember that more than 80 % ( based on my own experience) of them are either virus from script kitty or  spoof files (  they are big , and they do absolutely nothing )  from companies who made those games. If you only want it for music , use the other sharing programs ( like warez sharing , avalable to download from www.downlloads.com )  or the other versions of Kazza ( I can’t name it because of blogspot’s policy )   Well even if you watch out all the time some times we fail and a virus happens to be in our system .  What to do next? If your computer performance is degraded or weird things happens I HIGHLY recommend the use of ad-aware , an anti-spyware ( spy wares are programs that abuse your privacy by recording data and tracking your activities- giving you pop-ups and unwanted toolbars while using YOUR system resources for it ( che roy-ee daran bekhoda ) )    urlLink Ad-Aware   download it from the link above  remember to update it first by using the update button located on the first main page. If you are too lazy to find the update button , then go find a big baseball bat and crash your computer right now please… ( really I have seen people being too lazy to read what the poor programmer wrote on the screen ).  Ok, but ad-aware is not a virus scanner and alone it is not enough. So the next step is to go and buy a antivirus. I recommend McAfee or panda anti-virus. There is also other popular anti-viruses like Norton anti-virus from Symantec. If you don’t have the money or too lazy to walk out to a computer store then go to this site:   urlLink Panda Anti-Virus free online scan   remember to read the screen lol… this is a free online virus scan provided by Panda anti-virus. Remember that it doesn’t have the functionality of a real purchased virus-scanner but it is still great.  Ok that’s all I can say. Think logically and don’t let others trick you for their own benefit. And yes there is benefit for those who crate it. Whether it is solid money , or feeling big cause you just frustrated 2000 people by your virus.

      Brazil plug-in totally rocks. this thing is awesome. Brazil has it's own renderer and also it's own materials to produce a picture with much more realism unlike the default Max’s materials. Now Brazil is available for none-commercial use. splutter fish have limited the render resolution and also disabled the net render function to make sure no commercial use is possible with it's free plug in. I recommend ever one who works with 3ds max to take a look at it.  here is - well bad example of what brazil can do... lol , the real thing is much better. It uses the Brazil Toon material  ( I didn't have enough time to learn how to work with the new materials ). In case you are wondering what IS that. It’s one of my mom’s training in Auto-C.A.D. I imported it in 3d max and gave the lines some thickness. It’s a complex shape is it ? I guess learning some Auto CAD doesn’t hurt, even for art works.   urlLink

      I got my camera's memory lost for a long while. the memory card was founded few days ago. any ways , i thought i would take some pictures now. not being really a good photographer i used the camera's shutter time feature to create motion blur. any ways it looks over killed , yeah , but the karate-ish jump I took the photo from was really a lame one so even thought I know i over killed with motion blur , I rather stay with he current shutter time (1) .   urlLink

      So , the schools are over, and after 2 week only playing games I am back to graphics now.  First thing done for summer , a bit more of the “my room” scene....    urlLink     This image is rendered in splutter fish's renederer . but if you click it the bigger size is rendered with 3dsmax's default scan line renderer. ( since it doesn't allow bigger size for it's free vertion of max's plig in )   Also as you may have , or probably have not notice if you scroll down a bit there is a little image in that says my work available in turbo squid. soon by clicking it you will be able to go to turbo squid site and purchase or download for free some of my works.

      YES and yes and yes. I am 17 years and 12 hours and 10 minutes old right now. Well looks like I am getting older that I wanted to . being 16 years old was both good and bad, but it is all ok. “Death comes for us all, it’s just the matter of time” . and time, MAN it goes so damn fast. I won’t be having a b-day party or whatever cause I don’t like ‘em , and actually I usually didn’t have one because my b-day is right in the exams time.

      The Animatrix is a Japanese styled animation based on the matrix and it uses both 2d and 3d. one of the special facts about Animatrix is it’s combination of Japanese 2d and 3d. there are MANY tricks played on the audience in  this series and sometimes even if you pay attention you won’t be able to find them. The style of the movies varies in most of the episodes, some of them are pure 3d , and some are other styles of 2d   Here is an interview with the developer by Softimage about their 3d Package XSI 4.0 . I like the 2d camera rotation a WHOLE lot. It has a great effect I have never seen before.  Click here  Scroll down to “MAKING OF...The Animatrix” and then click on the small blue Q sign . you will need Apple Quick Time Player in order to watch it. You can download that from  urlLink HERE   Also 4 of the episode are available completely free to be watched or downloaded.  Click  urlLink HERE  to see them  (not recommended for young viewers)   urlLink    urlLink     urlLink     urlLink

      So… I thought it’s a good Idea to make a wallpaper, so I made one. It is made by Photoshop. The goal was to use windows colors and make it match the windows XP default blue theme. Here it is, click on the image to have a larger scale, then right click on the larger scale and click on save picture as.  That’s all for now , later.   urlLink

      As you can see there have been a few changes, each post is separated by a “nice blue line thingy” that I made, also clicking on images will show a larger scale of the to you. A link section is added that will contain affiliate sites/Web logs. Hope fully there will be a shout box added sooner or later.

      So as in the last post, I said about the snake fighter. i redone the top one ( the part that is not in the screen in the last post ) and also added shadows. Comments are more than welcome. any flow on the picture, or mistakes please tell me ( if you are not a member of blogger you can still leave comments by clicking the "post as Anonymous" link under the login section. Please leave your name under your comment) done in Photoshop 7.0 , a hand drawn was used as the reference. Shadows use a 17 - 24 pix diameter brush , outlines are drawn by 2 pix brush. It looks a bit over smudged thought …  took me  about 1:15     I still only like the bottom part thought   urlLink       And I apologize others already, but for those who have doubts whether this image is draw by me or not I can tell you, what’s the difference for YOU ? the benefit goes for me, so I shouldn’t care what you really think. But I Should care what those who take it honestly think. Now you stepped out side that circle.   -TAKA\ /AR

      I worked on the site layout more , and after 2 days and half i came up with this:    urlLink     The Clothing’s are drawn by hand and scanned, then the camo texture was drawn in Photoshop and added to them and their bump texture was scanned directly form the materials them self. Shadows are drawn by a Photoshop brush. Buttons lighting are created using an alpha map bump channel on the lighting filter.

      So... I went back to Iran and now i am back , also i got a small opportunity the display a bit of talent on a convention , it was a small but interesting experience. Also. Direction of GULFWAR modification is now changed and we decided to create this for Iranian audience , that means the primary language will be "Farsi" in it. I want you to all welcome our new Public relations: Amin . he will be helping me with getting the Persian online community to notice Gulfwar and help it in any ways. so the first step is creating a Persian site that can draw the attention of Iranians. the site is currently in basic development. here is an art work to show a bit how the site would be but the public relations suggested that i make a cool 3d version of it , he is right , Iranians are not tiered of CG like American audience , so this work doesn't count for them as a classic , they do like a cool OMG 3d or something:   urlLink     lots more stuff , I’ll write later.   here is
