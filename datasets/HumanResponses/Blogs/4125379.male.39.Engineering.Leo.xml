						   Our new manager's first move was to move our engineering department.  The reason given is that by moving the engineering department to the main floor of the shop from our second story group office was to improve communication.  The explanation was given that by being on the main floor of the shop we would overhear discussions and be more aware of what was happening.  Yep, that makes sense.  Break up the group by separating everyone into different offices (2 guys per office) and expect us to eavesdrop in order to get our information.  I can feel the increased communication already.  I suspect the real reason is that the new manager wants to keep his thumbs on us, which he can't do if we're on another floor.  So do we get to choose which office we want or who our office mates will be?  Nope.  The boss has already selected them for us.   Real  leadership doesn't force change on the followers.  A real leader would have prepared the follower for the change ahead of time, not walked in and dropped a bombshell. A real leader paints a rosy future and points out the benefits of the proposed change, thereby getting an emotional investment by the followers.  As it goes here, most of the guys are pretty bummed out.  We have a pretty sweet deal going.  A nice big room to work in, with big windows and our own thermostat.  There's a table in the middle of the room for snacks.  Now we'll be stuck two guys per office with no climate control.  - That's two to four computer processors and two to four monitors per office.  It's gonna be warm, so I hope my co-worker's deodorant lasts all day!

						   The initial post.  We discovered yesterday that our Engineering manager is moving "laterally". I'm afraid that's an euphenism for "upper management didn't like his supervisory skills and our now moving him into a position where he can work without impeding others".  So instead of an Engineering Manager, we get the General Manager who has no professional qualifications and has never supervised technical people before.  This should be interesting.  Just a small bit of background:  I work in an office of a mold job shop.  Customers send us CAD data of the piece they want to mold and we have to manipulate, design, model, inspect, create, and perform small miracles in order to get a set of prints out to the shop floor for them to produce a workable mold.  Most molds simply have two halves.  Sometimes called a cope and a drag, other times called really technical names like "upper half" and "lower half".  But not our molds!  Our molds have many pieces, anywhere from 8 to 12 pieces which have to slide, hinge and rotate out of position in concert to de-mold the part contained inside.  It is no small task to design these animals, and it is definitely the most difficult style of molds that I have ever worked on.  Our Engineering staff is small.  Just a couple of designers and several other guys who generate the NC programs which are run on our machines which cut the mold pieces.
