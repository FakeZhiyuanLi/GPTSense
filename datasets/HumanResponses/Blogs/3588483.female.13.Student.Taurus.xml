         Griffin: Griffins are gorgeous creatures with the head of an eagle and the body of a lion.  You are smart and can think on your feet.  You also can be a bit of an airhead and may be called a ditz by others.  You are not dtupid, but in fact, very intelligent.  You are also eager to help others and are usually docile and submissive. But if someone offends you you do bite back.    urlLink   What Mythological Creature Are You (Many Results and Beautiful Pics)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Oh wow, I totally want to play FFX right now. ^____^ I saw some  pretty cool pictures from Final fantasies in the net. Oh yeah, and I took this test: Which FFX dude are you? There weren't any pic's, so I couldnt put it here. But I was  50% Tidus , 20% Auron(whattaheck?),20%Kimahri(Arh?O.o;) 10%Wakka (bwuhu) and with a round  zero percent  I was  Seymour ! X) Oh well g'day to you all ( if there is any of you who actually has ever seen this sad excuse for a blog of mine ) I shall go to read some oh so lovely hanazakari no kimitachi e and play FFX through the  VERY  annoying Yuna/Tidus makeout scene. (I hate that part of the game!) urh.

       Those aren't so cool pics from Shuyen. I'm kinda dissapointed. U__U; there are million pics where Shu-sama looks better than in that. It was a good test though. I had no idea who I would be. :)

       Hanazakari no kimitachi e is my favorite manga (at this moment T.T) I just love it. I think manga is more fun than anime. maybe, its because i've read some wonderfully drawn manga, and then i get the anime of that manga, and it look so...messy! I think thats quite rude towards the mangaka/'s. Hisaya Nakayo is one of my fav mangaka. Clamp is just SO great too. They've made so many hits. Like Shirahime Syo, Lawful Drug,Magic Knight Rayearth, Card captor Sakura, X/1999, Clamp school detectives, man of many faces, Angelic layer...and so much more those I can't recall right now. ^.^ But they are so good. I dont know many other Hisaya nakayo's doings than Hanazakari no kimitachi e, and Inuyasha doujinshi. She must have strated her career with doing doujinshi...I went to a pet store and on the way there, I saw a snake O.O my dog was about to eat it until i realised it. I'm so BLIND x) I also saw a dead rat. (eww) Well anyway I hope they wont make a hanakimi anime! If its gorgeously draw...I dont mind, but I think hanakimi should stay as a manga. Its just better that way ;) Izumi, Shin, Nakatsu and Hokuto are so hot^.^ I heard umaeda hokuto's father named Azuma, is quite hottie too. he's 54 years old though, but he looks like he's in his twenties! I wanna see him *drooling already*

       Blargh. Its summer right now, and it as  hot as hell!  I feel like I'm in a giant  grill!  Bwah. I started FFX again couple days ago. The ending is so sad everytime I play it ;_;! Boohooo! I also bought FFX-2. Thats so great, but one very important thing is missing..:  TIDUS!  Damn, there aint no good FFX without him! In FFX Yuna used to annoy me so much, that I'd like to take a nearby chair and smash things with it.  Boy, I hated her.  Her japanese(original) voice wouldnt prolly been so bad as the english one. Ugh. But Seymours voice! Oh my goodness gracious, thats  TERRIBLE! So awful! Everytime I hear Seymour talk, these chills run down my spine. And what's with his HAIR? O_o; And his nails? The whole guy is totally creeping me out? James Arnold taylor did a good job, but...his voice was...mebbe a pretty too much high pitched ^^; But as I was saying, Yuna isn't annoying at all in the FFX-2. But the singing scenes are quite...barbie-like.  (ewww)  Paine and Rikku are cool too. But FFX is so the greatest :3 *meow* Its weird how many peoplelike TidusXSeymour slash. X( I mean, those are the worst things I can imagine >_ best!  :3 TidusXAuron isnt too shabby either...But thats enough about that.

       I haven't posted anything in a while. I have three reasons why: 1:Our comp broke down for a while. 2: I was tired and busy 3: Nobody has ever seen this sad excuse of a blog, but me, so I figured: "What the heck is the point -__-;"  Anyway; I was struggling to find a good FFX-2 walkthrough with ZERO success. I found one good spoiler-free walkie, but it didnt work...it was broken -_-; *psssht*  And I want to find some good FFX page too X) With lotsa fun pictures *nyuuum*   I shall go seek those out. *dashes away dramatically* Sha!
