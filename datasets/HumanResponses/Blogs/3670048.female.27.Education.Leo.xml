      Words cannot describe the extreame hatred I have for my grandmother some times.  Tonight she comes in and insists on making fun of me, calling me stupid because I cannot understand people on the television.  I have a hearing problem.  I have always had a hearing problem (ever since my brothers had great fun shooting cap guns in my ears as a child.)  Yet that somehow makes me stupid, despite my education. She's got this insane idea that I am going to chuck all the work I've put into my credential and my masters so I can fullfill HER dream going to law school!  Nevermind the fact that I hate lawyers (of any kind) and everything they stand for. I have never gotten so angry that I threw things, or wanted to break something.  Yet tonight I swear I could've killed her.

      Well today was just the same old same old. My father called this morning wanting his mail.  I really wish he wouldn't do that.  He never calls to see how I'm doing, just to get stuff or to yell and scream about crap my brothers did 20 years ago. Like I don't have enough stress in my life.I think I'm gonna have all his mail forwarded to my stepsister in Vegas.  My stepmonster worships the ground she and her illigitimate mullato daughter walk on.  I love how any guy I bring home isn't good enough, but they LOVE my stepsister's black ex-con on-again off-again shack up.  It doesn't bother me that he's black, it bothers me that he's been in prison, and more than once for that matter. Other than that I spent the day shopping for bunny supplies, getting ready for my little one!! I am SO EXCITED!!!! He's not comming home for a couple of weeks yet, but I got him a nice roomy cage (they were on sale!) and some toys and a harness and leash! I'm gonna try to train it to take walks, like a farret!  I know it's possible!  Bunnies are smart! Not to mention CUTE!!! OH he is so adorable.  I think I'll go by and visit him tomorrow when I get out of class. Speaking of which...YEAH!! I am going back to school!!! NO MORE BOREDOM!!!! My friend Rob wants to come over and play Magic on Wed, and I might, pending on when I get out of class.  He's going through withdral not playing with us on Friday, he was in Vegas for his Bachelor Party.  (I went a few weeks ago with his fiancee).  Well I am still working away, I need to send drafts of lesson plans to my master teacher three days ago.  I have ideas, several of them in fact and I've gotten some good stuff off the net, but it's all a matter of putting it out on paper and changing things around.  I'm nervous!!

      Well it is love at first sight.  A few days ago my friend's gave birth to four little tiny bunnies. Unfortunatly they lost two, leaving two very adorable little creatures.  In a couple of weeks, right around my birthday, I will be taking one of them home with me (my friend's 3 year old nice is getting the other one).  They are tiny and orange and mischevious, tell me this doesn't sound like Peregrin Took or Pippi Longstocking!! So whatever the sex, it will be a little Pippin! I shouldn't have any troble out of Miso (my turtle) he has the 3 goldfish to keep him company (Sushi, Sashimi and Tempura).  Brigid on the other hand... he has gotten quite used to being any only child! But I think he'll like the company. (He's my 4 year old Cockatiel and the love of his mommy's life!!)  After my grandmother refused to let me get a dog after my German Sheaperd died (Trinka passed on 2 years ago last April) I have been longing for something furry to cuddle with!! (I'm allergic to cats, which sucks cause I love them!!) I will try to get pictures of my darlings up on my website as soon as I can.  In the meantime I am taking a break from lesson plans untill I go back to school on Tuesday. (I start tues, my students start a week from Wed). And now I am off to Bedfordshire! ZZZZZZ

      I am bored stiff!! I have been sitting in front of this infernal machine for hours on end for however many weeks straight.  This morning I took a little me time, kind of.  Roommates were out so I had the whole house to myself.  I think I stayed in bed untill noon watching Monty Python's Flying Circus on DVD.  Yes I know I am freak, I have the complete Flying Circus, as well as all four movies (And Now For Something Compleatly Different, Quest for the Holy Grail, Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life)  I also have the A&E biography, Live at the Hollywood Bowl and several other live appearances by the group, in addition to countless CDs.  Yes I know I have a problem. Yes I know I need help. (the fact that I have the Dukes of Hazzard and 6 seasons of Buffy (season 7 won't be out till the fall I think) on DVD should clue you in to the fact that I really need to be commited. Well I am bored, I think I'll go to the gym and run a few errands. I may write later, I may not.  Who knows?

      Yeah, I know I'm quoting the Eagles with this one. Okay, so last night I'm online looking up information on Portugese explorers and working on my lesson plans, when out of nowhere I get a random IM from my ex, the first Joe.  Now, I had NO idea what he was talking about, and the minute I replied he goes off line and disappears for the rest of the night, at least under one name (he has two). So I'm thinking okay he IMed me on accident, stranger things have happened.  I get to thinking that he hates me, which I'm pretty sure of, and I have to admit for good reason.  It occurs to me that he thinks that I broke up with him through a friend, this is and isn't nessecarily true.  That was the frist time I broke up with anyone and didn't quite know how to go about it.  I made the cardinal mistake of telling a friend of mine that I was thinking about it, she in turn told the entire world.  She even went so far as to tell my best friend (at the time)'s girlfriend that we were sleeping together, which couldn't have been further from the truth.  I have since learned, you NEVER tell this girl ANYTHING!! The only reason I still talk to her (she drives me insane) is because her husband is a very dear friend of mine.   I handled the whole situation badly.  I had tried to tell him that I needed space,  that I needed time away from him, away from a lot of things, but he wasn't really willing to give that.  I don't regret what I did, but I'm not proud of myself afterwards.   Several months after I ran into him at the flickers.  He was in line with his new chicky and I was in line with mutal friends of ours.  I said "hi" tried to make polite conversation. Partly to be nice, partly because I was genuinly interested in his life.  I still cared about him, I still do care about him.  Now I was jelous, and medicated and just through another (rather horrible) breakup and some things were said (by both parties, at least by me and his new chicky) and I think the whole thing was blown out of proportion.  Now nothing can justify my behaivior, I realize that. But surely he knew me well enough to know that sometimes I say things long before I really think about it.  "Open mouth, insert foot." It's really quite sad, and I know I've paid for everything I've done (related to him and unrelated) on a karmic level.   I wish I could apologize to him personally.  I hope that he doesn't hate me too much. And the last thing in the world I want is for him to think of our three years together as wasted time.  Because it wasn't, at least not for me.

      Well this whole thing is nothing but a personal note, but oh well.  I wish I knew if people were reading this thing, though I'm sure they don't. Anywho it's a good place to vent and record my thoughts anyways.   Last week I started Weight Watchers.  This marks my third time on the program, but the first time that I actually WANT to do it.  I went on it high school, cause my dad and stepmonster were going on it and because Sandee wasn't cooking, she still doesn't cook, I was forced to eat their food (back in the day when they had tv dinners).  I did lose some weight then.  I have always been big, not grotesque, at least I don't think I'm that ugly, but I am big.  I always will be. My father is huge (even a year and a half after his gastric bypass) my mother on the other hand has never weighed more than 112 lbs.  Oh to be cursed with no thyroid. I am trying this. I know I need to do something.  I just hate to realize that people are really that shallow and the only way I will get a boyfriend is if I'm skinny.  Are people really that shallow? Each day I lose more and more faith in the human race.

      I know it's sacralidge, but I really hate summer vacations.  It's all nice and quite for about 2 days then I get bored and start counting the days till school starts.  I've also discovered that the key to keeping roommates and family off my back is to them that "I need to study".  People don't bother me when I am studying, and even less is expected of me.  Now maybe this is the lazy way out, but seriously, it's just so much easier when people don't expect me to contribute.  I have the rest of this week and the weekend untill summer school starts, but I swear, it's just dragging along.  GOD I AM BORED!!! Maybe it would help if I had a life of some kind, but even then I'm not a very social person. My friend Rob is going to Vegas for his bachlor party this weekend so I have no idea what I am going to do all weekend.  I may go out with his fiance Kristin (we went to Vegas for her bachlorette party a few weeks ago) but other than that I'm at a loss. I've also been thinking a lot about life the universe and everything, an adverse effect of boredom I'm sure.  I've gotten on to the subject of exes before in this blog.  Now my question to pose to those nonexistant readers is how would somebody react to hearing from an ex several years after the fact.  My list of exes is horribly short.  I'm still friends with two of them, another I saw last October at my friend's funeral and while we were amicable, I have no desire to see him any time soon.  My last one kinda hates me, which is really pathetic cause well his mommy told him too.  Oh how I hate Mamma's boys.  Yet I can't but wonder how Joe would react to hearing from me.  Or how I would react if he were to call me.  I suppose "what if" thinking is normal, and I don't regret breaking up with him.  However I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I didn't.

      I went to the cabin yesterday, but only for a night.  My family has a house near Lake Arrowhead, Ca.  We were lucky that it didn't burn down in last October's fires, though I have to tell ya we came pretty darn close!!  The fire burnt till about 3 doors down on both sides, we were in the curve of an "S" shaped street, and there were about 5 houses all together that were spared.  This house, a simple A frame that my grandfather built in the 1960's has been a vacation spot for my family since my father was a teenager.  I love it up there!! It's beautiful and clear and wreaks havoc on my allergies!! But it's great!  Other than that I met with my master teacher yesterday morning.  His  name is Brian (same as my brother and my cousin!) and he seems pretty nice, I don't think he's all that older than me, but who knows.  He's the History Dept chair at Parkman MS and usually teaches 8th grade history (US) which is frankly a lot more fun than 7th grade.  The course is only 6 weeks and will focus primarily on Exploration of the New World, early American civilizations (Inca, Maya, Aztec) and the Conquistadors.  Unfortunatly I know NOTHING about any of these subjects!! PLEASE IF ANYONE OUT THERE IS READING THIS PLEASE HELP!!!! I need info and lesson plan ideas!!! ACHHHHH!!

      Well it has come down from upon high that I will be spending my summer student teaching at Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills!! I'm going to be working with 7th graders who failed history the first time around! Oh joy what fun!  And from what I understand the course will focus on the Explorers, and Native American cultures (Aztec, Myan, ect).  So now that that is taken care of.  I have to meet my master teacher on Monday to go over the logistics of the course and get a copy of the text book. I'm a bit nervous.  It's been for ever since I was in Junior High, or Middle School as it's called now.  And I don't remember the seventh grade all that much.  Nor, unfortunatly, have I had much experiance with Middle School aged kids, just brief encounters while working summer camp and that was a hundered years ago.  Other than that there is not much to report. My father came home last night for a few minutes and I really wish he wouldn't.  My life is just so much easier when he's not here and when he's not in my life all that much. I know I shouldn't say such things, but it's true. I just don't get him and I don't get why he has to make things so much more difficult.

      Here I was typing away, commiserating on the course of my life and low and behold I seem to have closed the page before I was done and certainly before I saved what I was writting. Yeah, I feel dumb. Anyways, it's nothing all that important. I'm just a bit bummed. This week I recieved TWO wedding invitations, one to my cousin's wedding in July (in Colraldo, during summer school so I'm not going) and another to my best friends in August, the day after my birthday. I'm kinda IN that one so I have to go. All my friends are either married or engaged and here I am, 27 (in 1 1/2 months) and I haven't had a boyfriend since... well for a while now. I had one fling that was more sex than anything else, that lasted a month. And since then I've had married men hit on me, but that's about it. I keep wondering if maybe I made a mistake. 3, maybe 4 years ago I broke up with Joe (the first Joe, one after that was Joe too, before that was Jay... do I see a trend here?). Maybe I went about it the wrong way, maybe I was wrong for leaving him. I felt at the time that he didn't have any direction and little ambition. I was doing well in school and was close to graduating and was progressing with my life. I also knew that I was going on to grad school and just didn't have the time that he required from me. He wasn't a bad guy, and I did love him. I think I still do, well part of me still does. He was my first great love, and I know I hurt him. And I'm sorry that I hurt him. But I knew if I didn't leave I'd end up hating him. But now I don't know if that was a mistake or not? I hate to think that I screwed up my only chance at love. I hate to think that he was the only guy out there for me, or more so if I broke the heart of my one "true love". I just don't know. I'm not proud of what I did. I know at the time that I needed too, for both our sakes. But sometimes I think that maybe there was something else we could have done. I don't know. I'm not good with matters of the heart. And I tend to run away before getting too close, or else I tend to scare men off. If anything I want him to know that I'm sorry, and I don't hold any ill feelings toward him. I hope he doesn't hate me, though I understand if he does. And I want him to know that part of me will always love him.

      WOW!! I didn't realize it had been so long since I last wrote.  I have been busy busy busy!!  Independence Day has come and gone, I had friends over, we  B-B-Qed which was kinda odd being that Kristin is a Vegan.  Apparently veggies do quite well on the barbie.  I started student teaching last Wednesday.  I am at Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills and I like it!! I got some pretty colorful kids! Honestly they really are great.  All of them speak English (Strange for a California public school!!!) and they really are bright!  I think they failed last semester (this IS summer school!) mostly because they didn't do their work.  I think I'm going to grade class work higher than actual homework!  I haven't taken over the class yet, I do that Tuesday and start my own lesson plans on Wednesday, which will be really nerve wracking due to the fact that my University Supervisor has decided to come down on Wednesday as well! I'm nervous and TERRIFIED of that!! In the mean time I have introduced new memebers to my managerie.  Which is what my room is becoming.  I had some trouble with my turtle/fish tank leaking, so I got a new one (they're 10 bucks, I can't complain) so I got 3 Hermit Crabs to occupy the old tank (which is fine, it just can't hold 10 gallons of water anymore).  Rob's parents gave them a small (maybe one gallon)fish tank which they had no use for and gave to me.  I've put a Betta Fish (Siamese fighting fish) in it. So WELCOME Harry, Ron and Hermione Crabs! and Basil Betta!! I went by and saw Pippin last night, he's getting big and still SOOOO adorable!!! She should be comming home in a few weeks (we think both the baby bunnies are girls, but we're not sure yet). So that is life the universe and everything from this point. I've spent my weekend writing lesson plans, brushing up on the Columbian Exchange, writing a paper on Accountablitiy in the No Child Left Behind Act (SO FRUSTRATING!!!) and watching Fawlty Towers! I SO love John Cleese!!!
