      I like to walk to my office .It is very pleasant in the morning .It was 6.30 in the morning. My roommate and myself were going to our office and there She was, coming straight towards me.  The moment I saw her I realised that she was the one. She was like an angel landed on earth. She and some of her friends were jogging. I stood still watching her as she glided past me .How badly I wanted to turn back and run with her, only I know. As if she heard what I thought she stopped, turned back and looked at us .She came walking to me. Then my roomy bent down picked up a hair band. She came near me. Still trying to catch her breadth, with a beautiful smile she said in the sweetest voice I have ever heard that the band was hers.. but she was saying this to my roomy .She was not even looking at me.  In that moment I could have killed him for this.  What a frustrating feeling it is I cannot explain. I wanted to grab that band from his hands and punch him in the nose. I hoped my friend or rather enemy would just vanish and leave us alone. Watching her talk to him and not me is such a helpless feeling. I felt as if my life depended on the flip of a coin and I had no control over the outcome of the toss. She took the band from his hands and said the magic words; few from her lips, rest with her eyes.. She said to my friend "Thank you, Bhaiyya", and gave me a smile with a look which said "See you same time tomorrow" and jogged away. What I felt then is very difficult to put in words; the closest I can get is the feeling "Its good to be me".

      I never stick to one channel when watching TV.I like to surf. Yesterday I was surfing through the channels when I passed a channel were two beautiful women were in bikinis. I stopped and came back to the channel; they were hugging each other very closely. One was a blonde the other was a brunette. Then I noticed that they were doing this in front of a huge crowd, my heart raced. Pure animal instinct stopped me from changing the channel and I started to watch with the kind of interest every normal male would have shown under such circumstances (if you know what I mean)...slowly I realised that something was wrong. Suddenly it happened …the blonde lifted her partner and slammed her onto the floor. Went to far end of ring climbed the corner post made some signs as if she is going to kill something and sprang over the helpless figure on the floor. The crowd went crazy over this...the referee counted three and the Blonde won the fight.  After watching the fight I realised how right my friend was when he said that only two things could be sold in this present world without using any kind of intelligence. One is Sex and the other is Violence. I don’t see anything wrong in the first one, as Food and Sex are the primary needs for any of us. But something is definitely wrong with the second ---Violence. The fighters fight in the wrestling for money and fame (which acts as means to achieve the primary needs), which I think, is a valid reason for fighting. At least they get something out of it. But what do the spectators get out of it. Why is there such a Big craze for these fights. WWF, action in movies—why is a guy who can fake that he can beat ten other guys (his fellow actors) all by himself is called hero but a guy who can genuinely make the audience, not other actors, wholeheartedly laugh is a comedian and a sidekick to the hero. One thing I haven’t been able to understand is what pleasure can we get from seeing one guy kicking the ass of another guy when the one getting beaten up has done no harm to us. Never in the history of earth has been a species, which had killed its own kind in such large numbers. Are we inherently so violent?
