       urlLink     caterpillars (day 6)   urlLink        The caterpillars are huge!!  We are all exhausted!  The boys are going to spend some time with their cousins and Papa and JoJo (my parents).  Dancin has been doing dinosaur dot to dots which are helping him count.  We have also worked on goldfish math.  Kai likes to count also- he is getting up to eight.  Kai is also getting his colors!

       urlLink     the boys and their caterpillars (day 2)   urlLink          We are keeping a journal of the caterpillars as they grow. The last couple of days have been hectic due to Grandpa Harold's heart surgery (which he is recovering nicely from). Wednesday the 28th I flew out of the house at 7:30 to be at the hospital. The boys spent the day with JoJo (my mother) and Dancin went to camp. Thursday morning we did the calendar and the caterpillar journal before heading into NYC for a hospital visit. We read lots of books in the cafeteria (the boys could not visit). Dancin practiced counting to 100 with a number grid. He is so proud of himself! Friday we all went to the city after calendar and journal. The boys and I walked from Port Authority all the way crosstown to NYU hospital! (about 1 1/2 miles) We discovered the Glass Garden at Rusk. It was perfect, lots of plants, birds, koi pond, sandbox, play area outside with ride on vehicles. The kids loved it and then they had dinner with their Uncle Andrew in the hospital cafeteria. Many late nights, lots of break in routine, wild tired children, looking to get back to normal (whatever that is!)

       The caterpillars arrived in a box yesterday.  Today we began our "caterpillar metamorphosis journal."   Of course, we read "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" (Dancin helped read it!), then we went through the fruit and foods in Spanish.  We also counted them in Spanish.  They picked out a new cereal at the store yesterday (Gorilla Munch), which had all sorts of reading about Diann Fossey and endangered gorillas, etc. We talked about endangered species and organic foods and somehow we ended up looking at the volcano book.  We played the pond game from yesterday which covered the different seasons.  We talked about frog and salamander metamorphosis and read about them in My Big backyard.  Dancin had Trailside camp and the naturalist commented on him knowing his herbivore/carnivore/omnivore!  He was quite proud of himself.  We spent an hour at the museum, mostly in the dark area with the fluorescing minerals.  We came home in the pouring rain to learn about more flooding in the basement!  We then did some M&M math.  Dancin is picking up the addition subtraction pretty quick.  We counted by twos and fives.  We did some graphing also.  Kai wanted in on the action so he did some colors and counting to 5.  Then I asked him how to say "caterpillar" in Spanish and he looked at me curiously and said, "I just learned that!" (don't ask that yet mom!)

       We went shopping the other day for school supplies and I picked up an academic planner for lesson plans.&nbsp; When I opened it up it started on July 26.&nbsp; It's as good a day as any.&nbsp; Dancin has been eager to start.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp;     &nbsp;  It is really cool how much Kai is participating.&nbsp; He has been counting and singing the days of the week song all day.&nbsp; We started with the calender and then our usual books and breakfast.&nbsp; Kai excitedly took off to the playroom and happily played by himself while Dancin and I did cereal math.&nbsp; (sorting/counting/adding/subtracting/grouping by 5's and counting)&nbsp; We read "Rabbit's Habits" and made a list of good habits and good manners.&nbsp; Read "I'll Teach My Dog&nbsp;100 Words" and discussed learning to read and write this year.&nbsp; Read "A Pond for Maddie" from Click magazine (May/June)&nbsp;, went out to feed the fish in our pond.&nbsp; Discussed safety, pond care, pond life.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Time flew by and I am sure not all days will be this easy with Kai!&nbsp; After lunch we rushed off to Trailside for camp.&nbsp; This week is Animal Crackers/Natural Beginnings.&nbsp; He was very excited to have Jordan as his naturalist for the first class.&nbsp; He participated and had a great time as usual.&nbsp; Kai and I wandered the museum and found a whole new area to explore!&nbsp; We can't wait to share it with Dancin.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Next was the Loop playground for yet some more physical activity!&nbsp; We met a new homeschool family, boys (7 and 2).&nbsp; It is always encouraging to meet new people.&nbsp; Off to Whole Foods, the boys ate their way through the store and they learned about "pluots"&nbsp; a mix between and apricot and a plum.&nbsp;

       for the last couple of years we have been unschooling preschool, making connections with other homeschooling families, learning about cirriculum, keeping up with the laws and preparing for the moment we are now approaching.&nbsp; Dancin (4.8)&nbsp;would not officially begin kindergarten this year as he misses the cutoff date by a week.&nbsp; some of his friends will be going to school and he is already doing K level work, so here we go...    &nbsp;  i decided to journal our experiences this way for friends, family, strangers, myself and my children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i hope that it can help others in their journeys of either homeschooling or understanding homeschooling better.    &nbsp;  we have begun this week to get back to regular calendar time in the morning.&nbsp; both boys enjoy hearing about the day and laying out the events of the week/month.&nbsp;even Kai (1.11) sings the song about the days of the week.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  we studied cicadas for a few days, we found some outside and put them in the bug viewer for a closer look, we googled and learned about differentiating male and female, listened to the sounds they make, annual vs. periodical cicadas, even how people prepare them to eat!&nbsp; we went on a field trip to American Museum of Natural History in NYC and looked at cicadas under the microscope in the Discovery Room.&nbsp; we also went to the special frog exhibit which was really cool.&nbsp; of course, we went to the dinosaurs and the marine hall.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  the boys took their grandmother (JoJo) on a stream stroll hike at the Trailside Nature and Science Center.&nbsp; this is a favorite activity, they use nets to find creatures in the water, which are sorted out and then set free at the end.&nbsp; lots of salamanders, pollywogs, water striders, waterworms, fish, dragonfly and damselfly nymphs, crayfish, snails and eggs.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  there were also swimming lessons, swimming fun time, taking care of the fish and plants in the yard, playing out in the yard, helping with laundry, cooking, shopping, puzzles and reading tons of books. of course, there is also the Magic School Bus on video and computer.&nbsp; Dancin is waiting for Miss Frizzle to come help us get started with school.    &nbsp;  we have also been talking to Dancin about the human body and learning about the heart since his grandfather will be undergoing&nbsp;bypass surgery next week.&nbsp;

       urlLink     the chrysalids have moved into the butterfly garden!   urlLink         this morning after calendar we moved the chrysalids into their new home- the butterfly garden. the boys were excited to see them up close. it was interesting to see the little fuzzy shedded skin of the caterpillars. we read several books this morning about earth, solar system, snails and turtles, and the cereal box about puffins. off to camp for an Indian ceremony- let's see if they can get him to paint his face! he refused to do clown paint (this is national clown week) all week. lots of drumming around here. they were experimenting with different drumsticks on different drums and the deeper sounds they could achieve.

       urlLink    chrysalids  urlLink      We awoke to find our caterpillars have entered the chrysalid stage.  The boys were very excited and Dancin ran to grab the journal eager to report his findings.  We decided to give them a day to hang out before transferring them to the butterfly garden.  Yesterday Dancin asked "What is chalk made of?"  So, we studied the properties of chalk today and found a recipe for making chalk out of eggshells, the collection begins!   urlLink www.goldeneggs.com   urlLink      The boys continue to find cicadas in various forms around the yard.  Dancin enjoys figuring out if they are male or female and annual vs. periodical.        We looked at the website for the Franklin Institute and learned about how the heart pumps blood through our bodies.  We found out about the current exhibits and hours for our trip this weekend to Philadelphia.  We found a playground between there and the Please Touch Museum.  Then we went to the Liberty Bell website and read about it's history and looked at pictures of it.  I hope we have time to do everything in our 2 days!!        Dancin had a stream stroll at camp today- his favorite activity.  They take nets and fish for crayfish, bugs, nymphs, fish, snakes, frogs, pollywogs, etc.  He came back soaked so we went home and inflated the pool for some more water play.  It was hot and humid!!  We have been listening to Spanish CD's in the car and they are really picking up alot of new vocabulary.  Kai is singing the songs and beginning to respond correctly to numbers and colors in both Spanish and English.        Dancin has taken to teaching Kai.  He reads books to him and asks him to point to pictures.  He quizzes him on his colors.  Tonight he took on toilet training.  He showed him how to sit on the potty, read him a book about going on the potty and encouraged him to keep it in the bowl!  It was comical.  Then he helped him climb up and sit on the big toilet, which scared Kai a bit.  When nothing happened after ten or so minutes Dancin announced to me "Kai is done with his first potty lesson.  I will teach him more tomorrow.  I think he should wear a diaper to bed!"
