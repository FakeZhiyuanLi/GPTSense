						   I went to the vet yesterday..taking the kitten(mengka) for an injection.I went with my sister, mum and dad. My sister need to sent her kitten for an injection too. The place seems ok to me but I really dont really like the room! Its soo dirty...hmmm I think she is lack of manpower to really take care of the place. It was my first time there and Kakak was saying to me not to sent Mengka to the place again because she found the place is dirty.Maybe for injection I could sent her there but when it comes to microchipping (Look Below) , I may sent her to somewhere else.  Niki(my sister's kitten) doesnt look well last night after the injection but Mengka was fine! She running around the house when the kids play with her during the night. Jumping here and there..bitting here and there. Once she reach home from my mum's place last night, she ate her food and do her 'business' two times!!! hehe.Gosh I wonder what is she passing out so much eh? hehe  Right now, she is in the cage after the whole day running around the house and we brought her to Elias Mall which is nearby to our place.I think she will go to sleep :)   P.S.Microchipping is a procedure to insert a chip on or in your kitten so that when it is lost, it may be track down by the scanner when the kitten was brought down to the vet or anywhere which have the scanner. The scanner will scan the kitten/cat for the owner's ownership. Its actually a good procedure that my sister and I decided to do it next month.

						    urlLink    Guess what?! I got the kitten yesterday!!! It is a Ragdoll kitten..same family as the persian cat.Its a female cat and we named her "Mengka".It cost me hmm about $220 and the kitten/cat stuff for over $200. Thats a lot of money eh? compared if i did buy it at a pet shop its going to cost even more!It makes a lottsa noise during the night tho and we kept her in the cage..incase she didnt know how to go to the litter.The kids are so excited about the new kitten that they slept late last night.   This morning the kitten is making a lottsa noise when my husband turn on the lights. She wants to go out from the cage! I can even hear her from the bathroom (I was having a shower at that time) Gzeesss so loud uh??  I feed her with some cat milk and some food. She didnt eat the cat food..I think it is because of the new environment.She always wants to be release from her cage all the time! I hope she can wait for at least 3 days to get use to the environment especially where her bed is!!   I took her for a shower at noon and she smells better now...Aaaahhh :)))  I just peep on her just now and she is looking around...not sleeping tho..I wonder when is she going to sleep???!!  P.S. The kids are staring at the kitten and sitting in front of her...accompanying her??? duh!! Move away kids!!! Mummy is here!!!! hehee

						   Well this week is really a traumatic week of my life. As always weekend will never be a heaven for me...hmm what the hell Im talking about??? I can be such a crap at times...  Well as what I say earlier about this week...I received 2 bad news this week. First my close cousin just passed away on Wednesday because of bone cancer and another my brother's -> bro-in-law's -> sister-in-law (confusing isn't it?) just passed away this morning because of bone cancer and she is only 40 years old. Such a coincidence isn't it?? 2 person died of the same disease and on the same week? I'm speechless. I still remember my cousin where we met every year while we were younger. He is only 32 years old and had 2 younger children! I cant see him for the last time cus he was in Kuala Lumpur... Sucks isn't it...Seems like yesterday that I met him. Well who say young ppl cannot died I don't believe in that....  My nephew and nieces were at my home just now cus their mother have to go visiting. They left at 345pm cus they going somewhere else. Well quiet again....   P.S. Still downloading Sex and the City season 6...it takes a lifetime man....

						   Well like I say I seems to hate Thursday cuz it always remind me of the C++ class. I wish it was in the afternoon where I don't have to travel 45 minutes every Thursday evening to attend it. Maybe it is in the evening that's why I always felt so lazy to go. What to do...  Been to my sister's blog and she say that on her birthday only my brother wishes her. Hmm I also wishes her but she didn't put it down..What a bummer. Well she is lucky that my brother wishes her on the day itself as for myself my brother didn't even remember my birthday until my dad told him about it which is in the evening of my birthday that I receive his greetings thru SMS. Sucks isn't it. It doesn't really matter to me cus I really thinks that birthdays are the suckers day of my life! HAHAHA  I received the Whiskas sample of cat food thru the mail the other day and I didn't get it thru my mailbox but thru my neighbour. Can u believe it I receive it thru my neighbour???? She told Kakak that the mail was in their mailbox. What the hell the postal ppl doing???? Sleeping while working???? This is what happen when the job of the postman is given to someone else to do. Better???? I don't think so!! I think most of the mail are put on the wrong place or box!! Sjeess what else have they done!!! Sometimes your mail even reach to you later that usual or your mail will be in someone else mailbox! This is ridiculous! I hope there will be some ppl who complain about it and they have to do something regarding this matter!   P.S. I rather do the mail myself if this matter keep continue...      Oh btw the music is working now :)

						   Well yesterday was terrible I was down with a bad cough and I cant even sleep at night! Such a bummer!! Well it doesnt get any better today...as I cant really talk..painful to talk! Sucks isnt it?  I went to IERUS living ( funiture shop in Simie Eastpoint)yesterday to bought cushion covers plus the cushions cus the cushions on our sofa set were really worn out! Cost us about $419 for all of that. The lady told us that it going to be ready by September. Darn! A long time isnt it?   Bought Kakak a new watch named   at WhiteSand and it cost me $124. Expensive uh? About Ain's spoit watch, Hamid told me to forget about it, dont need to sent to the watch shop again for repair. Hey guarantee for 6 mths! But alas we bought her a new watch cost us a bit more than the repair ( shouldnt sent for repair at the first place ) named "25 Hours" and cost us about $59.30 after discount. She loves it! :)  Watch the movie "13 Going To 30" today. It is a really funny movie! The whole family really enjoy it!  We also watch "I.Robot" and it is really a great movie!!! :)) Will Smith my hero! hehe  Mengka was well already and I already went to the shop in Tampines to buy the IAMS. I also bought for her IAMS biscuit "Ocean Fish" which she really loves it. Phew lucky she recover or else I have to bring her to the vet.  P.S. Its my younger sister birthday today!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIS!!

						   Went to Pet Safari at Simei EastPoint with Farah yesterday before my C++ class, to buy Mengka some of her wet food i.e. canned food. As I was browsing thru the canned food area, I notice that the brand&nbsp;that she took which is IAMS,was not on the shelves! I ask the sales assistant about it and she told me that IAMS was discontinued! I asked why and they don't even know why. I was puzzled and angry cus now I am thinking what kinda food should I get for her. As I was looking at the shelves of canned food I decided to settle for this purple colour canned food named Solid Gold. It looks cool on the outside but damn its no good on the inside! haha   Well Mengka eat the food once I serve it to her last night and she loves it so much that she refuse to let it down. I felt relieved that she loves it&nbsp;as I don't have to look for it&nbsp;somewhere else! I thought its over but alas this morning she started to have diarrhea for more than 4x! I have to bath her nearly about 3x today and she look very weak! Damn she cannot take the "Solid Gold"&nbsp;food! No solid gold for you Mengka!! I immediately throw away the food and put her on her dry food hoping her stool will turn back to normal. Keep my finger cross....   Now she is lying down sleeping on the carpet and she have stop going to the litter bin more often :(  &nbsp;  poor kitty....    OH BTW check this site out hehe  urlLink http://www.jadeit.com.au/jcsworld/war3.html  &nbsp;  P.S. My sister call me just now and told me that a Pet Shop at Century Square in Tampines have a lottsa stocks on IAMS products! I will be going there to buy them...

I shouldnt sent the watch for repair...should buy a new one instead. But  I will give about 6 months or so and if it doesnt work again...I'm going to buy her a new one. Well next time do not sent your watch for repair cus it will never work as well as last time..except for good and expensive watch eg.

						   Well today the kids are off to school early cus they have the National Day celebration. Went to school at 7am and they are home by 930am. Drop by my friend house to take a look at her place. Kinda cosy tho and it is on the 14th floor! I really love staying on the higher floor but too bad higher floor are expensive than the lower floor.   Mengka wasn't so active as any other days but it seems that she been sleeping less. I decided to check her weight cus she seems to be slightly heavier than usual. Guess what! Her weight now is 2.5kg!!! Gain 0.5kg for a mth! I wonder if she have grown bigger, she wouldnt be able to fit in her carrier! I was thinking of getting her a bigger carrier if she cannot fit in the old one hehe.   The kids will be home till tuesday and we havent decide where to go. We may be going to Wild Wild Wet tommorrow but we see....   P.S. The cushion and the cushion cover that we order from IERUS LIVING,the other day, can be collected. But they will sent to our home on Wednesday cus we order the cushion too...

						   Well today I woke up at 5am and I cant sleep anymore after that. Hmm I dont know why it happen but darn I am so sleepy now. As usual the C++ class is today....*sigh*. But I still have to go cuz today is the last lesson. Wonder if there any tips for the coming exam.Exam is on the way...lets say about 2 weeks time. It falls on the 16 August and 18 August. Wish me luck!  Yati is really piss with me this morning cus I dont want to sent her to school. Kakak is going with her so I dont have to go. Ain is coming home by herself yesterday and she look so confident about it.   Mengka is 5 mths old on the 3rd of August and she look bigger than any 5 mths old kitten. Its so difficult to determine the age of the cat/kitten. They grow bigger everyday.   National Day is next week so the kids will be home till Tuesday. This Friday they will be having morning classes.I was thinking of going to Wild Wild Wet on National Day itself but we see about it. Hamid have to work on that day tho.  Watch Catwoman and Bourne Supermacy yesterday. I would give a thumbs up for both movies cus they are good. Dont miss it!  List of movies watch recently:  1)  Catwoman 2)  Bourne Supermacy 3)  I Robot 4)  Mean Girls 5)  Soul Plane 6)  Spiderman 2 7)  Shrek 2 8)  Girl Next Door 9)  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 10) White Chicks 11) Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story 12) Garfield 13) Day After Tommorrow 14) Chronicles of Riddick, The (2004) 15) GodSend 16) The Stepford Wives 17) Van Helsing 18) HellBoy 19) Around the World in 80 Days 20) Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed 21) A Date With Tad Hamilton 22) Taking Lives  And Lots more...
