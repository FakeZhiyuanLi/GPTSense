      I guess blogs are the new thing, and I&nbsp;don't want to be left out, so here's my attempt at keeping up with technology.

      Last night Jerry Douglas came to town and played a free concert. That guy is SO GOOD. He made me want to learn to play the dobro. And the best part was that his fiddle player had a mohawk. It was kind of like the whole band was saying, "Even though we play bluegrass instruments, we're WAY beyond bluegrass." They even had the same bass player as Nickel Creek. I wonder if that guy goes around joining bluegrass bands and then turning them into non-bluegrass bands. Or maybe in this case it was Jerry's idea. Maybe he got too sick of bluegrass from playing with Alison Krauss. Well it was a really great concert, nonetheless.

      Well I think I know what my problem is. I'm not opinionated enough to own a blog. I'm totally indifferent about almost everything, so I can never think of anything to write.  Maybe I'll just write about what I did last night. Ben and I went to the park with his aunt, uncle, and cousins to watch a Tongan brass band play. We ate chicken from Sugarhouse Barbecue and it was so yummy. I don't know what their secret is, but their chicken tastes just like camping. Then the plan was to go back to the cousins' house to have brownies and ice cream and play Halo, so I asked to be dropped off at home because I didn't want to stay up all night. Plus I don't enjoy video games very often. Well they opted out of playing Halo because they wanted me to come have ice cream with them, so I went, even though I hate it when people change their plans for me. It makes me feel whimpy. So anyway, you might think that means we got home at a reasonable hour, but we still ended up staying there until midnight. I don't know how those guys (Ben's cousins/aunt/uncle) can stay up so late all of the time and still get up at 6:30 to go to work. It's hard for me! For some reason, as soon as I graduated from college, I turned into an old fart who has to go to bed on time. Totally lame.  Well it looks like I have a little bit of an opinion after all...at least about people changing their plans for me and going to bed on time. Who knew?
