						   Fight Club:  A movie about the dark and depressed nature of human beings. The story starts with the narrator Jack (Edward Norton) speaking about his insomniac nature. Ed is sleepless for months and can't get any sort of cure from any good doctor. He wakes up in the nights watches TV , boards the airplane and keeps travelling , but he can't get that real sleep. He goes to clubs where the depressed people (With various incurable diseases) join hands and sympathise each other. (Meat loaf makes an appearance in the group as a guy with prostrate cancer). He then finds a guy after he loses his appartment in a fire accident. The Guy is Tyler Durden (played by Brad pitt) who changes his life completely. Tyler and Jack (The actual book doesn't have any name for this character) join and form an underground club called the Fight club where men fight to get relief from depression. The whole story revolves around this and what dangerous and crazy things that Tyler does and asks the group to do. A powerful performance by both Edward Norton and Brad pitt. Brad pitt was at one of his best and proves once again that there can be no other who can play such a role , well acclaimed after his performance in 12 monkeys made by the same group. In all fight club is a dark , full of blood humour watchable only by people over 18.

						   Hello World! Let me start my first posting with a short review of my favourite movie "Jerry Maguire". Enjoy reading. I am planning to post something every day or atleast once in two days in various topics. Have fun reading.  Jerry Maguire  The story of a sports agent who rises to the peak and falls to dust and wakes up with complete determination. A complete example of how a person should live through tough times. Jerry Maguire is a Football sports agent who deals with getting players for the team and promoting them. At the start of the movie, Jerry writes a Memo about how to succeed as a person, Everyone loves him for it. But he gets fired for expressing his moral epiphany , Everyone disappears even his fiance. He starts his own agency with one woman (Played by Rene Zellweger), his colleague in the company where he gets fired and one Football player ( played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and rises to the top, proves everybody wrong. Tom cruise is amazing in the drunken scene and when he romances Rene zellweger. The lady was no less amazming than the handsome actor, she proved her best after her great performance in Bridget jones diary where she put it lot of weight for playing the playboy bunny. Jerry Maguire, a war over failure with love and determination.
