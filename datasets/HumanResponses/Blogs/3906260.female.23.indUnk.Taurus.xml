      and for once this isnt about you, or you either lol:  i absolutely LOVE guys who are in relationships and come online to seek out a little something something from chicks in chat rooms and such. it's just fuckin A.  well, i guess it's not really cheating or NE thing like that as you are not physically with whoever it is yer talking to and it's basically like porn: entertainment. but still. it just kind of baffles me as to why you would. if things arent going so great @ home then i can see why. but in the same breath, if things arent going so great @ home, why stay?  i dunno just thinking outloud or something i guess.... it's all in relation to someone i know from online that's happy with this sweetheart of a girl yet dances around sex talk. it's funny too cuz he'll feel bad afterwards for trying and not talk to me for awhile. hey bean, he's like "dilbert" come to think of it lol. but back to this guy i was talking about. i actually think he's more confused on life than even i am, and this could be a big part of his offness but whatever. i digress. again, i was just thinking off the cuff.  this prolly doesnt make much sense, but really when do i ever? lol  and yes bean i know, i am a bitch :P  but enuff thoughts for now. im gonna enjoy my holiday! woot fer long weekends lol  cheers & much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~

      fuck me!&nbsp; why does life have this way of ALWAYS stacking up two great options and making you chose between them?&nbsp; i hate making decisions.&nbsp; i make the wrong ones too often and dont trust my judgement NE more.  god damnit!&nbsp; i want my cake and i wanna eat it too!&nbsp; it's just not fair!  i KNOW casual sex wont hug me in the morning.&nbsp; it's one of the reasons why i dont do it.&nbsp; but with ryan i dont think i'd care cuz i have zero interest in him other than animal lol.&nbsp;   then on the other hand i feel bad cuz i dont know where if NE where's this whole thing with drew is going....&nbsp; nothing is even close to being cemented, but because of how upset i was with someone else for disreguarding their partner's feelings&nbsp;in favour&nbsp;of&nbsp;sex, i dont think i could bring myself to do NE thing until i have an idea of where he stands.&nbsp; or at least i hope i wouldn't go against my beliefs.....  fuck!&nbsp; why do i have to be a whore?  bean, dont let me turn into sarah!&nbsp; no foolin cuz i MEAN it.  colour me black pot.&nbsp; im a hypocrite....   this is definitely my cosmic circle..... :0(

      Well, it took me awhile, but I figured out who you are.... &nbsp; Really  baffled as to how the hell you even found me, but whatever.&nbsp; Actually, I guess it's easy enough to find people online.&nbsp; I mean, I found you.&nbsp; How naive of me to assume you couldn't find me too.   I would like to say thanx bunches for the comment.&nbsp; REALLY enlightening.&nbsp; I just love being judged.&nbsp; Now, the only reason I'm not sending this to you in an email is incase of the chance - albeit it extremely small - it wasnt you that posted it. &nbsp;I know, oh so childish attacking you on a stupid blog and I am sorry if I offend you, but whatever. Deal.   Okay, i just had to put that in there.&nbsp; Back you you and your comment.&nbsp; Why did you even read this or my LJ?&nbsp; Seriously, I'm not mad, but why?&nbsp; I'm not going to preach privacy or NE thing like that because if something is posted online, then it kind of defeats the purpose of private, but still.&nbsp; I don't typically read things of people I know.&nbsp; For starters, I think if they wanted me to know, they'd tell me themselves.&nbsp; Secondly, it is&nbsp;weird and kind of creepy.&nbsp; You can colour me black pot if you want as I've read some friend of yours' blog, which in itself is just as weird if not more so but I havent read yours.&nbsp; I could really care less about you and your life. &nbsp;So you should care even less about me and mine.&nbsp; But whatever, I digress.&nbsp; What's done is done.&nbsp; You've read my shit and now think I'm crazy.   I don't suppose in your judging mind you cared to catch on to my point and realized WHY I was so upset.&nbsp; It's okay if you didnt, it took me awhile to figure it out myself too.&nbsp; I used to think I had some sort of crazy mixed up feelings for you.&nbsp; But now I realize my problem has had little to do with you or NE thing that comes from a good place.&nbsp; Well, actually, I suppose it is good that I feel badly.&nbsp; It gives me hope that I truely am a decent person afterall despite of what happened.&nbsp; But that's besides the point....&nbsp; I have been driving myself miserably nuts with grief over what I helped do to your girlfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't try to deny any wrong doing either btw.&nbsp; I'm not stupid.&nbsp; I knew the second I woke up at your place that she didnt just "stay" there occasionally.&nbsp; I could just tell.&nbsp; And I think I saw it in your face too....&nbsp; Bean trying to convince me that I was wrong in thinking you weren't completely honest about your relationship just prolonged my confuzzlement as she had me doubting myself. (Damn you bean! Can't really blame you as I am so often wrong, but damn you just the same dont worry I still luv ya though :P)   Okay, sorry, back to you again.&nbsp; As I was saying, I knew anyways.&nbsp; Bean stalking out your blog (sorry for the privacy invasion it's what she does) and telling me just put my mind at ease.&nbsp; Dont worry, I know next to nothing.&nbsp; I havent read it myself, nor will I ever.&nbsp; The only thing I was told is that you do infact have a girlfriend, and that for sure you've been together a lot longer since the last time you saw me.&nbsp; Now, I want to be very clear on this point here: I havent been upset about you having a gf.&nbsp; Go you.&nbsp; At least someone is getting regular sex....&nbsp; But in all seriousness, you're not mine hon.&nbsp; You never were mine and you owe me zero explanation about your personal life.&nbsp; Frankly I could care less.   What I do care about is the fact that you were still with her when I was around.&nbsp; I dont enjoy carrying around feelings of shame and guilt for being a homewrecker.&nbsp; Granted we really didnt do that much, but still, if my boyfriend cheated on me, and what we did  would  be classified as cheating, I'd kill him.&nbsp; Then I'd hunt down the bitch that was with MY guy and kill her too.&nbsp; And I'm not even violent or confrontational person.   I'm so not throwing this all back in your face to make you feel guilty btw.&nbsp; I'm sure you've beaten yourself up enough, or at least I would hope you have.&nbsp; And like I said to you before, you owe me zero explanation.&nbsp; But in the same breath, you have no idea how much I wish you'd been more upfront and just had the balls to just say, "No, I can't do this. I'm in a relationship right now, and I could nvr hurt her in that way" I wouldn't have been upset.&nbsp; I would've understood because like I said, you weren't mine to get upset over.&nbsp; How I only wish you could've said no....&nbsp; It would've save me so much angst and guilt....&nbsp; Not to say I dont accept my own part I played in this.&nbsp; I put myself into this predicament and I should never have invited myself over.&nbsp; I'm very sorry....&nbsp; God how I want to take it all back....   Fuck! I just keep putting myself in her place, and if I found out....&nbsp; I would be crushed.&nbsp; So picturing her broken little heart even though I'm sure she has no idea about me, and even though I don't know her either, just breaks mine....   Alright. I think that's about all I have to say on this subject.&nbsp; My god how exhausted I am from it as I'm sure you are now too.&nbsp; I'm sorry this was so long....&nbsp; Actually, you know what, completely off subject here but I just realized something....&nbsp; Whenever I've been around you I've clammed right up, and now, I wont shut up.&nbsp; How's that for irony.... Oh well, who cares really?&nbsp; So, moving on.&nbsp; If you've taken the time to read the whole long assed post, I hope it's given insight unto me.&nbsp; You said before that I had some troubles with letting go of issues.&nbsp; If I were a person on the outside looking into my jumbled thoughts I would think so too.&nbsp; Infact even with the most inner perspective seat in the house, I still couldn't for the longest time figure out why I couldn't just forget about this.&nbsp; I normally dont stay upset about anything.&nbsp; Whatever is plaguing me I forget about it the next day.&nbsp; But then I realized I've never done anything this wrong before.....&nbsp; Can you see that now?&nbsp; Do you even care?&nbsp; Prolly not and you prolly still think I'm nuts.&nbsp; Oh well, whatever.&nbsp; I tried and now I'm tired....   In conclusion, although this&nbsp;post prolly sounds bitter, I want to stress that I am not bitter.&nbsp; This wasnt coming from a hostile place nor was I&nbsp;trying to make you feel bad or piss you off.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp; And if that's all I succeeded in doing, I am truly sorry.&nbsp; Just please try not to make snap judgements concerning me okay?&nbsp;   I wish you nothing but good fortune.&nbsp; Oh so corny cliche I know, but it's true.   And I now officially close this chapter in my life for good.&nbsp; Really.   Much kindness,  Jamie

      kenny called and woke me up @ 8 this morning only to freak out about the printer STILL being broken!&nbsp; i told him i was sorry but that fuji assured me they would be in this morning to finish the job they started.&nbsp; kenny wasnt really that mad as the guy sucks at being a hardass, but he was uber stressed and now i feel bad.&nbsp; but there was nothing i could do.&nbsp; paul came in pulled some wires and sucked out some screw in the filter and left telling me to just wait while the chemicals heated up.&nbsp; i waited 2hrs for them to heat up and then i got the same damn error msg again!&nbsp; grrrrrr!!!&nbsp; so i called them back and asked them to send a tech back over in the morning.&nbsp; i assume they showed up as i havent heard NE thing from kenny again.&nbsp; hopefully it's all fixed by the time i get there.....&nbsp; my luck though it's STILL broke!&nbsp; damn u karma gods for finding me!!!!!  why cant i ever have just a bad day?&nbsp; why do i have to have really awful horrible bad days?

       i swear, NOTHING about me is quick on the uptake... im just NOW getting over my hangover from thursday night....&nbsp; like holy delayed reaction much?&nbsp; it's prolly just exhaustion cuz i didnt eat much yesterday only that bit of cold skettie and that ended up coming back up anyways (gross i know)....&nbsp;&nbsp; actually i even wonder if it was a hangover cuz i felt sick in a weird way.... tense sick or something i dunno....  after work today i went to mom's and she was cooking steak.&nbsp; my stomach was half-settled and i actually wanted some!&nbsp; i couldnt believe it as i havent had steak since ash-wednesday of 1994 when i gave red meat up for Lent and&nbsp;then decided not to eat it ever again.&nbsp; mom wrecked my craving (and prolly for the best too cuz i doubt i would've enjoyed the steak) simply by saying "what?&nbsp; since when do u like meat?!?&nbsp; you'd better not be pregnant!"&nbsp; just the mere mention of the word "pregnant" made me feel sick all over again and for no reason as there is almost no possible way i could be.... what's up with that?  i dunno mom's making me homemade chicken stew right now which is weird cuz i didnt even ask her to.&nbsp; she knows it's my fave, but she nvr just does nice things for me....&nbsp;infact we just got into a huge stupid fight over milk of all things.&nbsp; so it's making me wonder why she's being nice.... the bitch is prolly poisoning my soup&nbsp;trying to kill me lol&nbsp; actually it's prolly cuz she thinx i really am preggers cuz when she said it i nearly threw up and came to lie down without saying a word to her.... greaaaat so not smart james.... now i have to have an uncomfortable conversation with her in which she's gonna leave thinking im not telling the truth....  christ this is soooo not a good day.... i've now got that on my mind, and i had to blow off plans with bean tonight and she's gonna be sour.... she already is sour and that makes me feel bad  ARGH!!!&nbsp; somebuddy shoot me!&nbsp; i hate feeling anxious and upset over nothing!&nbsp; actually come to think of it, i've felt like this all day.... it's almost like my body knew what was gonna happen before it did....&nbsp; okay that's nuts!&nbsp; why do i always have to try and apply logic to everything?&nbsp; it's kind of ironic really me wanting things to be logical cuz im so not the most reasonable/sensible person on the planet.... i dunno maybe it's cuz i think it will give me a sense of control in a world full of chaos or something....  speaking of chaos i bought the butterfly effect the other day and i love the opening line to the movie:  "it has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wings can start a tidal wave on the other side of the world" - chaos theory  that really appeals to me i guess it's cuz if i use it to again, apply logic to my own crazy life, by contrast it depics how one fuck up effects all fuck ups or something along those lines.... i dont even know where im' going with this.... i guess like i said above if i can somehow make a logical path of explanation for all the random events in my life, it gives me a sense of control or being or something to that effect.... i know, crazy huh lol  oh well i digress and thus concludes the short voyage into my psychee  cheers and much luv  me  ~xoxo~

      at work tonight i was still feeling pretty junky and my_sarah being the oh so honest bitch i love tells me how bad i look.&nbsp; i was like yeah i know will you shoot me?&nbsp; and she asked me if that's how i wanted to die.... in the middle of work with a billion people standing around as some crazy chick busts a cap in my ass.... normally i would've laffed @ that off the collar remark but it hit a little too close to the upset feelings of yesterday and it got me reflecting more on death.... &nbsp; maybe i really am scared to die.&nbsp; more so then i let myself believe....&nbsp; i've nvr shown much caution when making decisions and that's basically because i have next to no common sense about things that are potentially dangerous.&nbsp; at least in reguards to my own life.... other people's actions, i can see the shockwaves of reprocussions a mile away and i try to be the voice of reason (that's an oxymoron if i ever heard one me equalling reason lol) and warn people of the pittfalls before they encounter them.&nbsp; but with my own potential disasters, im clueless! &nbsp;i've always wondered why that is.... but that's a whole different topic lol &nbsp; back to being fearful of dying.... i guess when i think about it, im not so scared of the fact of dying so much as i am the way it could be acted out.... &nbsp;growing old and becoming decrepid/senile is DEFINETLY the worst way to go in my opinion. &nbsp;which is the whole reason i came up with the dying before im 50 plan.&nbsp; i will more than likely tack on a few years as that date comes closer and closer.&nbsp; infact i'll probably toss the whole idea right out the window in a few more years when i bare more resposibilities ie: children/family because i know i wont want to leave them behind..... but for right now it's not how i want to go.&nbsp; i know millions of people do it as it's the course of life but it's not something i want for me. &nbsp; dying of cancer is also another big fear as it's victims are degenerated so quickly.&nbsp; i dont want to go from healthy as a horse to in my grave in less than a year.&nbsp; i know not all cancers spread rapidly and a lot are curable if caught in the early stages but again, not the way i want to go. &nbsp; drowning im actually undecided on that way to go as i nearly drowned when i was 12 @ the aquatic center here in town and my experience was actually calming not horrifying as one would think.&nbsp; i'd just jumped off the tower in the olympic pool and started swimming over to the edge.&nbsp; i'd gotten&nbsp;myself less than an&nbsp;arm's reach of the edge when i'd just become too tired and i started to go under.&nbsp; had i had the strength to reach up i probably could've grabbed the edge but this exhaustion just overcame me and down i went.&nbsp; it was the most sureal thing.&nbsp; it was almost like i was watching myself too because i could remember seeing an aerial shot of myself going further and further down.&nbsp; but @ the same time i could see infront of me the pool wall infront of me moving as i kept slipping.&nbsp; very weird.... im sure i was only under for about 2 secs when i felt the lifeguard pull me up but it felt like an eternity and it wasnt scary at all.&nbsp; i think janet (my mother's best friend who had taken her daughters my sister and myself to the pool) scared me the most.&nbsp; she came rushing over screaming and crying in her high pitched voice "jamie!&nbsp; jamie!&nbsp; oh my god are you okay?&nbsp; what happened?&nbsp; how am i goin to explain this to&nbsp;her mother? &nbsp;is she alive?&nbsp; JAMIE!!!" but other than her melt-down, the whole experience&nbsp;was actually&nbsp;&nbsp; the most peaceful calming feeling i'd ever felt in my life.&nbsp; im sure that sounds crazy and considering it's me and i panic over EVERYTHING i find it&nbsp;odd too that i wasnt scared.... &nbsp; burning to death is DEFINETLY a HUGE fear of mine.... i HATE pain.... i have an extremely low threshold for it i cry like a bitch when i get a bit of a sunburn! i couldnt imagine the horriying pain that would be associated with burning to death.&nbsp;  &nbsp; i hope i dont die in a car accident either.&nbsp; the only person i've EVER felt safe with while they're behind the wheel is my father.&nbsp; it's prolly cuz he's my dad and i've got the whole "daddy is my hero and he'd nvr do NE thing to harm me"&nbsp; pedistal goin on but he's the ONLY person i feel at ease with while im in a car.&nbsp; whenever i was with sarah jayne in her car i was ALWAYS tense.&nbsp; i would sit in the passenger seat with my eyes closed most of the time.&nbsp; she is a CRAZY driver.&nbsp; if we were ever in a head on collision, i think i'd end up having a heart attack on impact.&nbsp; i think coronary failure would be the cause of my death as opposed to broken to bits.&nbsp; she drives at extreme speeds and god forbid she's ever in an accident, people will die.&nbsp; a friend of mine is a really careless driver.&nbsp; she's like a scene from clueless most of the time behind the wheel.&nbsp; i've been in her car for 6 fender benders that she's been invovled in and the impact that is shocked through the car is unbelievable even when she's barely doing 5mph.&nbsp; it nvr ceases to scare the living hell out of me to feel CRASH.&nbsp; a head on collision or any type of collision for that matter going at a fast rate would probably send me right into shock.&nbsp; i've got chills now just thinking about it....  &nbsp; i personally HATE to drive as i nearly killed myself when i rolled my car less than 30days of getting my lisence when i was 16.&nbsp; im always tense behind the wheel and if @ any given moment i notice myself not feeling nervous driving i actually wont drive for awhile.&nbsp; it's my way of keeping myself in check i guess so i nvr have an accident like that again.&nbsp; bean is scared of driving too.&nbsp; it's prolly only cuz their car's a stick and she's not very confident on how to drive it yet but she's petrified.&nbsp; im not usually too scared when driving with her as i know she's more scared then me.&nbsp; i tell her that fear is good because it keeps you from getting cocky which leads to accidents. &nbsp; i dont even know where that bit came from actually lol.... moving on: &nbsp; flying:&nbsp; im not scared to fly.&nbsp; but my recent trip to mexico made me realize it's not one of my top favorite things to do.&nbsp; we didnt experience a whole lot of turbulance but the waves of motion that go through your stomach during take off and descendature made me nervous to the point of nausea.&nbsp; it was like a rollercoaster only not so much fun.....&nbsp; if im ever in a plane that's goin down, i hope im unconscience and i sleep right through it.&nbsp; for 2 reasons number one i think i'd be throwing up everywhere's and that's not pleasant for me or NE one around me not that it would really matter i guess as we'd all be dead in about 30 secs NE ways, but whatever.&nbsp; the other reason is the same reason i close my eyes in a car.&nbsp; the fear of knowing my death is coming straight ahead of me, and im helpless to stop it.... &nbsp; so to conclude this subject, i dont want to die in such a manner that i know it's coming.&nbsp; when i had my car accident i had that feeling in the pit of my stomach that said "oh god im going to die".&nbsp; luckily i didnt, but the feeling of total loss of control of what's going to happen is so not fun.&nbsp; i speak from experience and never hope to live that feeling again no matter what the situation.... i hope to go as quickly and as painlessly as possible.....&nbsp; but really dont we all? &nbsp; nitenite! &nbsp; muchluv me;0) &nbsp; ~xoxo~

       Current music: I've still got "fuck it" by eamon going through my head from last night.&nbsp; they actually played that as the slow song @ the end.... i swear this town is getting more and more redneck by the day lol  &nbsp; frig i still feel drunk!&nbsp; the last time i felt this&nbsp; loopy this late after drinking was when i still worked @ cendant and i was laffing my ass off watching my cat destroy my shower curtain yelling @ sarah jayne "it's lunch time and LOOK AT ME!!!&nbsp; im still DRUNK!!!"&nbsp; i had to work that day and i didnt sober up until almost 3 oclock it was crazy.... i think that was the day i did a nose dive tumble down sydney street actually lol.... i would feel bad about the people that called me that day, if it werent for the fact that im sure they were assholes just like every other rude person that called me in that shit hole.... andy prolly got a kick out of listening to some of the QR's from that day though lol &nbsp; so yeah im rambling but what else is new lol &nbsp; on a more normal note though i just read on msn martha stewart's goin to jail!&nbsp; HAHA!!!&nbsp; the just part of me does feel bad that the government made an example out of her.&nbsp; but the rest of me is celebrating!&nbsp; i cant stand that woman!&nbsp; it's prolly cuz im the most undomesticated person on the planet (i can barely boil water im that bad lol) and she makes me feel bad but whatever!&nbsp; i still&nbsp;think it looks good on her....&nbsp; it'll be fun to hear the horror stories about her being "big bertha's bitch!" AHAHAHA!!!&nbsp; that just reminded me of a conversation with bean one night standing in line @ the bars.... &nbsp; me: "why do driver's lisence pictures ALWAYS look like junk?" bean: "i dunno.&nbsp; i know what you mean though mine's horrible!" me: "yer's really isnt that bad.... we both just look like snotty bitches.... sarah's is DEFINITELY the worst i've ever seen!" bean: "sarah looks the one who's getting it in jail from some prision bitch" me: "no, sarah looks like the prision bitch that's GIVING IT&nbsp; to some other poor bitch!" &nbsp; funniest thing like EVER!!! &nbsp; oh well as i said before im glad martha's getting hers!&nbsp; fry bitch fry! &nbsp; ugh i really wish i hadnt eaten that cold spaghetti.... i normally love cold spaghetti and i figured the carbs would eat up the liquor in my stomach but it's making me feel not so good :0( &nbsp; oh why do i drink like im still 19? &nbsp; that'll learn me right?&nbsp; HA! &nbsp; *cheers* &nbsp; much luv me &nbsp; ~xoxo~

      yeah so it's like 4 in the morning and what am i still doing up awake?&nbsp; well i just got home from the Q had a pretty good time actually.&nbsp; danced with drew gave hime my number who knows if i'll ever here from him again lol got&nbsp; a drive home with mike and&nbsp;we made fun of kat picking up....  &nbsp;  me: (whispering not so quietly cuz im drunk of course lol) "kat, what r u doin?&nbsp; u could do soooooo much better?"  kat: "jamie, shut up!"  &nbsp;  mike found that wildly funny and really it was!&nbsp; the guy was a troll but oh well go kat for gettin some ass whether it be ugly or not lol&nbsp; fuck she's a hooch luv her to death but she's a skank lol  &nbsp;  oh and i got one of those tabu bottle opener key chains free with my tabu tonight wooOOooo!&nbsp;&nbsp;go me!&nbsp; sorry&nbsp;very excited about that lolo but give it up fer free shit!!! &nbsp;  so bakc to the topic @ hand the other reason im awake.... (now hopefully i can do this topic justice while im tipsy.... but the subject is kind of wrecking my buzz so i should be okay).... it wasnt even somebuddy i remotely know's funeral today..... andrew's great aunt or something died and it was her funeral and andrew and bean were home to attend it.&nbsp; i knew bean was coming home today, but i didnt know what it was for.&nbsp; she left me some crazy msg on my yahoo last night asking me to call her the second i got in.... so i call her like 3 times and theres no answer.... i leave her a msg on yahoo telling her im going out but to buzz the hell out of my yahoo whenever she gets the msg..... she calls and wakes me up this morning to tell me shes in town for a funeral and that she forgot what she was upset about last night.&nbsp; i was like okay whatever but i know it prolly had something to do with a certain someone who's leaving and the fact that he's seeing some slutty bitch (see bean, on the very likely chance you've found me here i mentioned no names.&nbsp; and just a note to you QUIT READIN MY SHIT!!!!&nbsp; i left lj for a reason lol) but whatever she'll tell me what her deal was when she's ready i guess.... TELL ME NOW BITCH lol  &nbsp;  okay way off topic there so not doing a good job of writing in sensible patterns lol&nbsp; damn you alcohol and making me love you!!!!&nbsp; speaking of when the fuck did i start liking beer?!?&nbsp; and i dont even like budweiser NE more which i guess isnt even beer so i'm told by 'REAL' beer drinkers lol&nbsp; i was downing alpine (which used to make me sick) and keith's (which REALLY used to make me sick) all night long.... like wtf? but again way off topic lol  &nbsp;  so back to death.... for some reason bean telling me she attended a funeral today really made me depressed.&nbsp; it got me thinking about how i've always said that i wanted to off myself the day before my 50th birthday.... it's still a long ways away, but i just realized today that it's a hell of a lot closer than i previously thought when i came up with the stupid idea.&nbsp; i dont know if i want to die that early or not now when i think about it.... i mean im gonna be 25 in a couple of years and by my calculations that would mean my life is almost half over.... i havent done NEARLY the things i'd always thought i'd have done by now.... i'm not done school.... i dont have any children.... im no where's near close to being married..... i've been in a panic all day long thinking i'm running out of time or something which is so stupid!&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole reason i came up with wanting to die before i turned 5o was cuz i didnt want to grow old and senile.&nbsp; i would rather be dead than in a nursing home or a burden to the people i love while i slowly rotted and lost my mind.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  and thinking about how close 50 really is to my age right now, for some reason got me thinking also "what if i died tomorrow?" and that REALLY got me upset.&nbsp; not because im scared to die because im not.&nbsp; im more scared of the people close to me dieing than myself.&nbsp; i was upset because it depressed me to think of probably how few people would show up at my funeral.... i mean family is a given and i've got a big family so it would look like a decent show but as far as true friends go there prolly&nbsp;wouldnt be so many people there.....&nbsp; i dont know it just upsets me to think that i've touched that few people in my life.&nbsp; true people that would actually care if i wasnt around the next day to make them smile.....&nbsp; it just really depresses me to think that way.... almost inspires me to reach out to more people or something but how do i do that without coming off as a whackjob lol i dunno.... i guess i really am too loopy to make sensible thoughts right now.... im sorry.... bed's calling and im gonna answer i prolly should of answered earlier before i started on this....  &nbsp;  nite nite &amp; much luv  me  &nbsp;  ~xoxo~

      so i was just thinking now about all the shitty things ive done this year and pondering over why my karma's been pretty good....  i mean with the exception of bad luck in the love department nothing tragically off has really happened to me.... this is weird cuz i've done nothing to sustain a good karma rating infact i've done the exact opposite so why havent things gone into the toilet?  crap i prolly spoke too soon and i'll get hit by like a bus or something later on today lol  oh well maybe i shouldnt knock it....  but somethings gotta happen right?  hmmm maybe i should try to help an old person today....  and so i wait for the shit to hit fan....  much luv me  ~xoxo~

      just reflecting over this past year and how my actions have caused me so much stress.  i've made myself miserable to no ends and havent really had a moment's peace.  it's made me lose over 50lbs which hey, im not complaining over but still its something my doctor's gonna be concerned about the next time i see her....  i'm actually amazed my body hasnt said "screw you james, im taking a break" and hasnt all but died on me.  i guess i learned to adapt to the stress or something i dunno.    but i finally decided not to allow myself feel so badly NE more cuz it wasnt just my fault.  i was lied to and acted under false pretenses.  it took someone i luv SCREAMING that fact @ me to finally get it.  so i've been worry-free now for a week or so but my stomach is all tense and in knots almost like im still upset.  but im not.... it's almost making me wonder if my body is suffering from withdrawl symptoms or something where i've functioned with this stress for so long now....  i know that sounds crazy lol  but still it really makes me reflect on the power of guilt....  oh well enuff of that.... gots to go out and enjoy the sunshine!  much luv me  ~xoxo~

      gawd i luv my nanny!  she's absolutely the greatest woman on earth and i dont know where i'd be without her today....  im very nervous about moving up to fredericton when the time comes.... i am accepted into both unb and nbcc and i just have to make a decision on where i want to go.  i should finish up my degree but i just dont know if i can do university NE more.... i mean i nvr thought it would be a problem but this year has been a real eye opener.  i've had to learn an awful lot of HARD lessons and it's all but shattered my confidance.    i guess it's just cuz i cant play dumb and float through life in my naive little bubble NE more.  old habits are really hard to break.... especially 23yr old ones.... damn my parents for sheltering me, and never making me work for NE thing.  i realize how spoiled and self-centered that sounds but still DAMN THEM!!!  it sucks having to walk blindly through this life.  im too old to just say "oops my bad" or "daddy fix this" whenever i mess up.... im gonna end up doing something irreparable sooner or later.    i already have done some horrible things this year that nobuddy will ever be able to fix.  i hurt someone i dont even know in the absolute WORST possible way ever.  she'll nvr know how i hurt her or even really that's she's been hurt, but i know and i live with it every day of my life.  i also lost a best friend and that hurts a lot too.  i dunno i guess the whole point to this thing is im scared of being out on my own.  im like a child that you have to monitor 24/7 cuz who knows what kind of trouble i can get myself into.  i mean i have Bean and i have a few others in fred i can depend on if i need to and my parents are only an hour away but in the same breath i almost dont want that.  cuz it just makes it that more easier to mess up.  i mean if i have someone there to help me fix it it kind of makes it okay for me to screw up if that even makes sense.... i guess what im trying to say is if i didnt have a support system readily @ hand i'd be more conscience of my actions....  it almost makes me want to say to hell with my life here and go to hfx instead.  but then again kat's down there and as much as i love her i dont think i'd enjoy living in the same city as her....  and as far as not wanting to live in the same city as kat goes, i could say the same for fredericton.  i mean i only know a handful of peeps there but i dont particularly enjoy some of them....  one in particular i dont know how i could bring myself to be civil around them cuz i'd like to beat their face off most days.  well not really but seeing them would bring back a lot of bad memories and im not so great @ putting on a fake smile and acting hunky dory.  i wear my heart on my sleave and i know they'd see right through my faux grinning facade.  that would just be uncomfortable for all involved....  and it's doubtful i'd ever even really run into said person cuz we're completely different people so the only common place we might ever meet up would be like the gas station or something like that.  but still, the concern is there and i dont know if i want to set myself up for an awkward sitution like that....  im amazed i havent run into them yet actually.... i mean im in fred enough as it is, i practically live there....  argh i dont know im all backwards.... back to my nanny i was talking to her about all of this tonight and although she only said "jamieanne, you will be fine" it was very assuring.  there's something about her that's just so soothing.  less than a month to go before decision time ARGH!!!  what am i gonna do?  enuff stressing about it for now  much love me  ~xoxo~

      so, i have a live journal but i think i'm ready to venture out and make the distinction between "journal" and "blog".  i'll still keep my faithful lj but it will be for feelings and emotions and all that junk while here will be my new home for nothingness.  plus im not so annoymous on lj anymore and i miss that.... :0(  (bean do NOT find me here!!!!)  playing with settings is always fun.... i chose the pink template cuz i luv that colour!!!  a little perplexed that it was designed by a "dan rubin" but whatever dude.  thanx bunches!  creating profiles must be on a different page oh well i'll find it sooner or later...  im rambling and have to boot to workie *yelch*  so this was my first contribution to polluting the net with crap!!!  YaY go me  and actually it really sucks.... im sorry i did the net bad better luck next time lol  much luv jamie;0)

      leave it to me to have both complete and total opposite feelings on this....  why must i complicate EVERYTHING?  i AM looking forward to going....  there's this just this ONE teeny tiny huge thing that wants to hold me back and it's not even relevant with reguards to ryan.  oh well cant back out now....  i leave in less than an hour....  fuck i hate making decisions.  i know this is prolly wrong and i dont know how to get out of it now....  but in the same breathe i dont WANT to get out of it either....  fuck is it possible to be 23 and 3 all @ the same time?  here's hoping there's a giant assed accident on the highway.  and where i came up with the worse case scenario i prolly just jinxed it from happening.... but maybe that's what i want NE ways....  i SUCK at making up my mind!  and is a lie of omission really a lie even if it's for the greater good of saving someone from harm?  u know where im going with this....  im sorry....  im SO listening from now on and im fucking burning the internet...  future note to bean:  incase it ever comes to this point, always remind me "jon = more baggage than air-fucking-canada!"  oh here's hoping i dont crash and burn....  much luck to me :S jamie;0)  ~xoxo~

      yeah i STILL didnt make it to see ryan....  i cant get over how fucking stunned i can be @ times.  forgetting my damn wallet?  i swear this shit ONLY happens to me....  so what do i do to console myself?  i go sleep with drew.  fuck!  that was prolly a big mistake :0(  i dont even know why i did it as im still a little sour with him. but when he called last night i was flipping mad over my stupidity and missing out on seeing ryan AGAIN!  i needed to get out of the house.  imagine my shock when he calls me up and invites me out to his place.  i was like what the hell might as well go.  we sat and talked to his brother chris all freaking night long.  im so dubbing chris cockblock from now on.  his motor mouth does a helluva lot better of a job than NE thing you could pull there bean :P  but yeah chris was SUPPOSED to go out and do kareokee(sp) with some friends but the next thing he knows it's midnight and it's too late for him to go.  drew's like "well, jamie i should take you home now"  we get outside and he's like "fuck i wish my brother would just shut up!"  we're halfway to the car and i think to myself "you know what?  fuck it!  i want sex!"  so i coyly ask him "would it be so bad if i stay here tonight?"  he's like "no!  not at all but do u really want to listen to my brother all night long?"  he's so not getting where i was going so i say "we just walk in and tell chris goodnight"  and he's like "ooooh"  frig i luv stupid people lol  so yeah that was my night.  im just getting in now and thinking to myself casual sex really isnt so bad lol.  the only thing i feel kind of bad about is chris kind of gave me a little talk while drew was in the shower.  he says to me "so what are you doing with my brother?"  and i reply "having fun"  "having fun huh okay then... well make sure you dont hurt him haha"  he said with a smile.  i got a good vibe from him, so im pretty sure i passed the little brother test.  i know i passed the mom test when i met her a couple of weeks ago and i dont think i want drew NE more.  he satisfied my needs last night and i dunno....  oh and of course whore me feels worse for ryan :0(  i feel like i cheated on him or something lol.  i was going to go for a walk cuz i was so sour and needed to cool off.  i said something about being sorry for fucking up again and told him he should pick up that i'd feel better.  he said to me "that wont make either one of us feel better"  i told him he wasnt mine and i wasnt his keeper.  he said "i know, but im not just out for empty sex with a stranger.  not that i know you soooo well, but still"  im a slutasaurus....  well maybe that's a little premature.  i can officially say that after tonight cuz im FOR SURE going to fred till wed.  my wallet is sitting pretty on my desk.  cibc STILL hasnt posted my payment but at least i've got cash so if i absolutely need to even though i freaking HATE it i could take the bus....  bless me father for i have sinned;0)  much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~  ps bean i'll be giving you a shout while im in town im sure luv ya pps worse case senario jinx again lol: because im really not trusting the universe right now, and for all the horrible things that could go wrong, just stay the fuck home you.

GRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!  ps to bean.... i havent said much on the subject either.. i mean i mentioned it once earlier in the week, but i dont think you took it all that seriously.  i guess i decided to leave it like that cuz im kinda fearful of you lol.  i didnt want u talking me out of it or getting mad with me.  i dont know if you just havent read my posts or if yer just pissed and dont want to talk about it.  either way im sorry for not saying much.  but i am going before he leaves.  i promise i'll suffer in silence if i fall.  i love you.

      yeah i switched departments @ work a few months ago cuz i hated my annoying crazy assed boss.  even though it meant i had to go back to working with the general public i thought it would be well worth it to get the hell away from her....  yeah i was way wrong.  i hate people and im rotting having to help them.  and now that i dont have to work with my old boss, i luv her.  she's an absolute sweetheart....  fuck how i hate irony....  but on a better note, i feel pretty light today and for no apparent reason.  and i have the urge to want to go dance in the rain....

(props 2 sharon :D)  i just realized it's friday the 13th....  "gawd fuckin damnit" really just about sums it all up lol  and whoever it is that's got the voo-doo doll of me, im way sorry!  please stop poking pins in my head :0(  yeah im gonna shut up now  much luv as always! me;0)  ~xoxo~

      i was talkin to bean tonight and she shared her funny life epiphamy with me: she and andrew are just like jessica simpson and nick lachey.  she's been addicted to newleyweds *gag me* (sorry bean it's a little outta my taste range but u likie so dont let me ruin yer fun lol).  she said that everytime jessica says something nick comes back with a smart-assed reply.  and if NE buddy's ever sat through the damn show then they know how completely undomesticated jessica is.  i have to admit, bean and andrew's life is pretty similar by comparison.  jill's clueless around the house (well not really but by comparison to mother-in-law-martha-stewart-wanna-be she is) and andrew's a smartass who enjoys making fun of her.  when bean called me she was like "my life is on tv!"  it made me think of the movie clueless and how i've always thought it parallelled my own life.  i was like damn our life stories are published for all the world to view and we're not making a dime in royalties haha.    okay yeah i know that's stupid lol  but i thought i'd share :D  bed's a calling now though so bid thee all in bloggerland a nitenite and sweet dreams!  much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~

      okay so i'm guilty of it.  i've searched through member profiles on msn and chatted up the random few people that dont look like axe-murderers.  u can colour me black-pot to a certain extent on this one, but i only look @ people in my area's profiles or the one and only time i went out of my own city i was looking in fred cuz it was when i decided i was moving there.    i dont get these people who are from now where's near me (new york, maryland, fuckin EUROPE!!!) and decide to msg me.  i think it's annoying most of the time and i usually am pretty rude to them, well until sarah jayne taught me a mean assed lesson, fuckin wench lol.  but like seriously, these people have nothing better to do then to look up little old me's profile when i live a zillion miles away from them?!?  just so not getting it.  im really gonna have to change my yahoo soon cuz since i put on there something about socks i've been getting a LOT of off foot fetish creeps msging me.  my own damn fault i know like what was i thinking trying to be cute and coy and share my latest news with people of buying new socks?    gawd i hate people!  /end rant  much luv as always! me;0)  ~xoxo~

      so weird.... i was just going through old emails and i came across one i'd sent to you a long time ago.... i dont remember writing it. i dont even remember the last time i felt that nice towards you. now im petrified of ever seeing you again....  you will be the 1st thing in my life that i've never come full circle with. i dont feel bitter but i dont think i will ever be able to feel good about you again, and i find that sad....  yer unfinished business and it's actually left better that way....    im surprised im content with only being halfway.  its very sureal for me....

      cuz my blogger is being a bitch and i cant get to the original post where u commented im gonna do a whole new post and paste yer reply to the original one so u know what im talkin about and then reply myself from there....    "Not sure who this is to or about but here is some advice that sounds like it came out of a self help book or something:          Doing nothing only leads to questions. Taking action gives answers. Bad or good you gain from it, but by doing nothing you will always lose.           Dark humor counter point:     Unless of course the person you are meeting is an axe murderer. In that case you won't have much time to use what you learned from the situtation. ^^ "    this is very true my friend.... im gonna use it for my excuse for all the dumb chance choices i make in life thanx lol.  but the friend this was directed @ already knows the probable answer to his or her question. there's a very likely chance that meeting their online friend is only gonna cause trouble, BIG trouble. it's a complicated situation and only they can make the decision of what the bigger loss would be: the so-called unanswered question they already know the answer to deep down in their heart or the fall out from taking a chance..... there's really no life lesson to learn from the fall out other than "never do it again".....  btw i just noticed u used the term "axe-murderer" interesting choice of words....  *cheers*  ps to my friend cuz i know u get soured easily on other people's opinions this wasnt meant to be judgemental i PROMISE!!! much luv so dont hate lol ~me~

      i've really got to laff @ my parents. my dad especially. he's a technological idiot (must be where i get it from lol). he's had zero use for a computer except to check email and do boring work things on it. but as of lately he's joined the information superhighway and learned u can do lots of fun things online like play games and chat with people. he's all about the chatting now. he's got some "bread" chick that he talks to from michigan. it started out innocently enough just talking to her in channels on games sites. then it moved onto msn and yahoo messenger where they do audio convo's. pretty advanced stuff for a guy that could barely dialup into the net connection manager a year ago lol.  my mother just walks around obliviously and doesnt seem to realize the danger of what dad's doing. i keep telling her that one of these days 'bread' is gonna be my new mommy and she's gonna be out on her ass but the stupid bitch just laffs. i dont even know why im concerned really as my parents by all rights SHOULD be divorced NE ways. they borderline hate eachother. dad spends more time down the camp away from her then he does @ the house. and if my bitch mother gets burned by some online chick it would prolly make me smile (mom and i have some issues).  maybe it's just the pattern of the men in dad's family that has me concerned. dad's 2 brothers have both had dramatic midlife crisises (sp). uncle john went and quit his 150K/yr job to become a teacher @ community college. uncle donnie went got himself a girlfriend a couple of tattoos and spent 2 wks down the camp secluded from civilization to "be at one with nature" and then announced to his wife, my aunt (obviously lol) that he wanted a divorce. as much as i complain to my dad that he is sometimes too boring and uptight about life, he's my dad and i love him just the way he is. for him to be doing something so out of character as going online and chatting to netwhores has me disconcerted to say the least.... but oh well it's his life. im the child not the parent right lol  on another note as i was thinking about my family and male midlife crisis patterns i remembered something i realized @ nanny and grampy's anniversary party.... my sister and i are the only 2 people in the whole family - cousins, aunts, uncles, everybuddy - that dont smoke. not sure what relevance that is really but i think its sad.... and i cant even fully loop myself in the non-smoker's circle. i smoke when im drinking around smokers. really stupid of me and i hate it afterwards when i cant get the ashtray smell out of my fingers for like a week. actually i prolly wont ever do it again. the last time i was out with my_sarah i smoked half of her pack in 2hrs by myself. my chest felt like an elephant was standing on it for 10days. so not fun :0(  oh and bean if things dont work out with drew tomorrow night and he's interested in nothing more i am SO coming up to fuck ryan this weekend. just a heads up lol.  much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~   EDIT: whipped cream.... mmmmh thanx fer the idea ry;0)

      i REALLY wish you hadnt found me here bean. well actually right now it doesnt matter because i stuck around to hear what u had to say but if i'd gone with my initial feeling of "fuck you im outta here" when u were goin on about me and sarah being crazy in our ways of thinking the world is after us or karma gods are after us it pissed me off. i wanted to rant right there on the spot and be like you bitch! lol but im glad i stuck around. u corrected yerself and made me less mad. luv ya :D  but i am gonna touch on what u said even though im not mad lol. with sarah i kinda do see her point in thinking the world is after her. i mean she's not the greatest person in the world but shes not the worst either and EVERYTHING turns to shit for her. i mean   EVERYTHING!!!   she's confuzzled as am i really on why horrible things just keep on happening to her. granted she does walk around with a (rightful) chip the size of manhatten on her shoulder which repels a lot of good things im sure but im not brave enough to wanna tell her that are you? lol maybe we should actually. we'll just have to wear protective head gear and such. i'll send u in first k? i've got yer ass dont worry hehe.  with me i dont really think the karma gods are after me. but i do believe that what goes around comes around. if im mean/bad here im gonna pay for it there is how i look @ it. no tragically off couter-actions have happened to me in my life to break faith in this belief and im gonna hold on until something does. i dont enforce my theory to make sense of other people's lives cuz what the hell did u do to deserve anything bad in yer life and what the hell did sarah do to deserve EVERYTHING bad in hers but for me and my life it works. you know im nutty in that sense and how i need to make logical patterns in my own life. it makes me feel better that i have an explaination for bad things in my life - even if im the only one who gets it lol.  as far as me feeling bad when good things do happen to me, it's just cuz i dont understand it sometimes. im not a HORRIBLE person, but im not the greatest person either (especially this year). so for happiness with drew to just fall into my lap, it's thrown me for a loop and its making me question the logic. somethings i accept for "that's just life" IE felix dying. maybe drew is one of those random things. i typically enjoy randomness so i can accept that as an answer if i need to lol. but i felt bad that i couldnt share with sarah. i dont want to rub my happiness in her face when she's so miserable. like i said, i've done NOTHING to deserve drew. i mean NOTHING unless repenting has made me worthy (that's the sisters talk rubbing off on that one me thinx lol) so it makes me feel like im cheating life or something. i know u dont like my logic but its how i feel. i just dont think it's fair for me to float along aimlessly without purpose or good intent and fall assbackwards into happiness.....  i dunno it throws my whole belief system out of whack lol it's not a circle NE more it's like a race track or something lol  oh speaking of circles... i too had a weird dream last night.... i dreamt that i was @ hojo's with drew and who do i run into? of course and his room is right next to mine. i said to him in my dream "well, how's this for a cosmic circle" very weird lol. im sure it means nothing but i'll be avoiding hojo's just the same lol. i dont even like driving past there NE ways. i get the same only less intense yucky feeling i do as going past comfort inn lol  i know bean. im weird lol  and now i gots to boot to work damn kenny called me in :0(  much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~

      last night was oh so much fun!  met some random dudes who were taking their friend, that's getting married tomorrow, around uptown looking for chicks to sign his t-shirt with marital advice. whore me what do i write? "Last night was the best sex EVER!!! Keep it up! Best wishes tomorrow - Jamie xoxo -" im a bitch lol everybuddy got a good laff out of it though;0)  ended up running into drew.... was kinda awkward :0(  he was with his friends i was with bean and we couldnt just ditch them to hang out.... bean being the bitchy voice of reason so lovingly pointed out "yeah if he's dancing with some other chick tonight because u didnt set down NE ground rules, you HAVE to be okay with it." i love it when she speaks the truth. it was funny cuz when we went to leave i went to find him to say good nite and i see some guy on the dance floor that looked like him dancing with a bunch of chicks. i sourly said "well, it looks like he's having fun. let's go!" i ran into mike and dave as i turned around and was chatting with them for a bit. meanwhile bean is giving drew and that chick the dirtiest looks like EVER!!! then she realizes it's not even him. so funny she was more madder than i was. i gotta luv her.  THANX BEAN U BE THE BESTEST!!!!  We left the mile after that. im soooooo done with the bar scene. or at least the one in sj. it just sucks ass here. doesnt compare @ all to sweets NE more. and bean wont EVER go out in fred again after lush sarah jayne's spectacle performance last weekend. i dont really blame her for being tired of playing mommy. i cant say much cuz im usually just as bad. im not barfing all over the place and i can walk but im obnoxious and she's constantly telling me to shut up. im gonna miss our tag team bean lol  oh after the mile last night we went down the boardwalk cuz andrew and danny were playing security guarding the festival set overnight. that was fun. i learned that danny is a HILARIOUS perv andrew is a horny perv (well i knew that NE ways lol) and that i fuckin HATE the card game 45's!!!!  "winnie the pooh in the fuckin honey pot!!!!" ahahaha  pirate danny "arrrr me lassie! u gonna bid or pass?" AHAHAHAAAA!!!  guarding the big molson canadian beer can "uh oh.... where'd it go?"  "man, you are SO fired!!!" lol  "you were awesome!!!!" ROTFLMFAO!!!!  bean: "andrew.... i had a little accident with the car" me: "i am SO collecting bitch!!!" HAHAHA!!!  ahhhhh good times!!!!  much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~

      drew's a 'sweet' kisser. no force just gentle. it's nice i guess.... and i do enjoy the forceful grip he uses it does kind of make up for the lack of passion and adds a bit of rawness but.... *sigh*  okay damnit! i wanna be kissed like im being fucked or something! why do i always have to find guys that cant kiss properly? im gonna have to try and break this one's habit though cuz it's just too mundane..... is it even possible?

      i always think about this NE time im in freddy. although im pretty much jaded to it by now and this time i didnt have NE rude experiences, it's the whole ignorance of the city that makes me enjoy it a little bit less than i should. it seems that people who are from there make zero effort to be kind and curtious to others. common gestures like saying "excuse me" when u walk by someone or "sorry" when u knock them over (unless it's on purpose;0) ) dont seem to exist there. it also makes me more snotty when im up because i find myself doing the same thing. although this prolly has a lot to do with the fact that im a pretty impressionable person (marketer's dream eh bean lol) so i tend to morph my personality traits to reflect those around me.  okay that's a prelude into where im going with this i guess. yesterday morning bean and i were talking about sat night and she was like "i was just WAITING for you to run into joey" i was like "highly doubtful we would've seen him @ the bar, but yeah i know what u mean. i was waiting to bump into him somewheres too." but i didnt so i guess my karma's still doing okay lol. thanx cosmo gods!  she asked what i would've done and im not sure to tell the truth. even though i was looped and i love everybuddy when im drunk lol im not sure if i would've been able to be nice. i wouldn't have been rude or mean or NE thing cuz that's not me but im not sure i could pull of the whole genuine "hey how's it going meaningless chitchat". i think it would be awkward more than NE thing and i'd just feel really uncomfortable and embarassed. i have no idea whether he's read NE thing of mine or not (if u have stop reading my shit please) but it would always be @ the back of my mind. i think i'd end up coming off as a bitch really. i wouldnt mean to as there's no hostility, but i dont think i'd smile cuz i wouldnt be happy and NE smile i'd try to plaster on my face would look faux for sure.  maybe i'd just do the whole when in rome thing and walk right past him. i can be ignorant in a place that's full of it and nobuddy would be the wiser lol.... nah im not like that. plus it would be really hypocritical of me. as a member of society i believe it's everyone's duty to be polite and curtious @ all times. smiling and saying "hi" is your responsibility to help and maintain tranquility in the world. i hate ignorance so why be a contributor for it's cause? i mean, i personally dont enjoy being rude. the only time i ever really am is when someone is irritating me and even then i feel bad afterwards lol. hopefully if he's ever around me i wont notice and walk right on by with oblivion. but my luck i'd walk smack into him.  bean fully expects me to cry lol. i think i'll be too stunned to cry i'll be too stunned to do much of NE thing really. i think all i really could do is smile @ the irony of how it's always the last person on earth u want to see that's BOOM right there in your face. (remember byebye wendy's tray bean  lol). oh well enuff worrying about something i have no control over. i'll see him if i see him.  i've really gotta luv how my world spins....  much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~

      okay. so cyberspace turned reality lesson # 5 or 6 now and i still failed. i suck lol. alright. ryan wasnt as bad as i said before. infact i feel like a shallow bitch. especially now cuz he actually wanted to hang out tonight despite seeing me in all my drunken slobby glory. and even though i'm a helluva lot smaller than i was a few months ago im still not stick skinny. so bean making a comment about ry's pig friend HATING fat chicks and how he calls NE buddy who's over size 2 a moocow just made me think ryan would be the same way.  i was just talking to him online.... i dont know why i didnt recogonize him last night. he looks exactly the same. i am oh so oblivious. he knew right off who i was. he said he turned around and saw the 3 of us walking up from the street and he knew it was me even before i said NE thing. i was wrong too btw. i'd still do him.... bean hold me back lol  okay that was a really long sidetrack there. i almost forgot what i originally wanted to post here.  meeting people online: this is for you btw  okay even though i've had half a dozen or so bad experiences ranging from assholes, to freaks, to "full on monets" (lol) and to more-baggage-than-aircanada. and even though i regret meeting most of them i think had i not met them i would've always wondered "what if". im gonna use my last 2 experiences as examples.  joey: the first time i met him i wasnt really so keen on it as i'd barely been talking to him when he's like "yeah im coming to sj for work. lets meet up" i couldnt really think of a reason not to so i went along for the ride. prolly completely obvious to him that i mostly didnt want to be there @ the time. the second time i met him, i knew come hell or high water i was gonna see him that night. "cock block" (haha still luv ya bean) wasnt gonna stop me. she tried her damndest and as much as i wished later that i'd listened to her i knew and she knew it was pointless @ that time to try and talk sense to me. to this day im still not sure WHY i felt the need to meet him again but i did. and there's even a tiny part of me that is glad i got to see him again. im not sure what i would've been "what if"ing about, but i know me, and i would've been upset to some degree over nvr taking that chance.  meeting ryan this weekend was the same deal. i HAD to meet this guy. there was no 2 ways around it and i was stepping over bean's dead body to do it lol. with ry though, i know why i wanted to meet him, and it had (tiny edit)  little  to do with sex lol. he's leaving in less than a month so it was a now or nvr type of situation. i jumped on NOW and i dont regret it. that prolly has a lot to do with cockblock though and the 80 times she said to me "you are NOT going home with him!" and go me i actually listened. had i not listened im not sure i could still say it wasnt a mistake. it sucks the whole aura of this hawt guy is kind of tarnished for me though but still, no regrets. im not left wondering "what if" or thinking to myself "i should've done it when i had the chance"  so use my 2 examples to make yer own decision. even though the fallout could and more than likely WILL have serious reprocussions i know you and i know that u will always wonder "what if" if u dont take the chance and meet him. i feel almost like im being a bad friend in not trying to guide u away from the problems that WILL ensue from meeting him (what if i dont like him? what if i DO like him? what if he doesnt like me? how can i move all the way out there? what do i do about ____? etc etc etc.  u know what.... i AM being a bad friend. okay seriously think very strong and hard about this. use my examples as reasons why you SHOULDNT do it. yeah that's it lol. i mean u know the fallout after joey. and had NE thing happened with ryan i'd prolly go through the same thing just to a much lesser extent. yer like me and u CANT just have sex without reprocussions. if yall meet u know you'll end up sleeping with him. and maybe that's what u want but THINK about what happens after that....  frig! i change my mind on this more than you do even im sure lol i suck @ sorting things out im sorry :0(  okay this is a whole captain obvious to the rescue summarized last piece of advice but do what's right for you. think ahead and see what you'd regret more: not meeting him or the fallout from meeting him....  much luv though as always :D me;0)  ~xoxo~

      okay.  so besides sarah jayne fucking throwing up all over me my night last night was pretty good.   got loaded danced my ass.  good times despite the puke lol  and im EX-FUCKIN-STATIC that i didnt run into NE buddy....  on to ryan:  yeah he is ruined for me now....  he is sooooo much hotter on cam and he sounds so much hotter in audio convo then he does in person.  like im AMAZED at how different he was.  i didnt even recogonize him.  the whole meetup was way random.  we were walking up to the line @ sweets and bean sees this guy and is like "jamie, isnt that dude?"  i was like "ryan?  i dont fuckin think so" and she's like "i think it is" so i tap this guy with a questionable face and say "heeyy i think... are you..." and he's like "hey!" we chatted for a bit in line while im completely put off on his appearance (i know oh so shallow of me).  fantasy was totally ruined for me lol.  i said i'd see him in the bar once we got past covercharge and the girls and i went and did our thing.  he came over a couple of times to dance with me.  was fun i guess.  and @ the end we made out on the dance floor before bean came and dragged me away to help her with sarah....  so yeah totally ruined.  it's funny how different people can be online.  i know im a big culprit for it as i am usually way less outgoing when someone first meets me until i get comfy enough to be myself.  but just wow!  this morning bean and i were goin over the whole night laffing to ourselves at how crazy it was.  we were also talking about ry and how i wont be able to see him in the same light again.  she basically called me shallow and i was like "he's too tall, he's too lanky.  he looks like what got beat up in highschool or something.  and the fact that he's a big stoner, not that i was a fan of that NE ways, but now if i ever see him smoking another bowl again im gonna 'think u goddamn poser!' cuz he so doesnt look the part!"  he came online and was chatting to me and said something about goin skating for the afternoon.  i was like OMG!  and bean goes "u made out with a fuckin skater?!?" and gave me a thumbs up.  so funny lol.  im so pissed cuz he wasnt relationship material.  he was potential fling material.  now reality has set in and it's not so hot NE more....  so yeah, im way shallow :0(  but on a better note, IM GETTING A GMAIL ACCOUT!  woot fer geeks ;0)  much luv me;0)  ~xoxo~

      holy oh fuck! definitely a weird night.... sarah jayne came with to fred. it's the first time i've seen or talked to her since our huge fight in spring break :0(i kept waiting for my head to get caught in the geeotene (i so know that's the wrong spelling lol). was way different. but she just broke up with her bf who was an absolute ASS NE ways. so of course what does she do but get uber drunk! i was dancing with ryan (yes i met up with him) when bean comes over and is like "yeah, our wonderful friend is fuckin throwing her guts up in the bathroom" i had to leave ry and went to the bathroom with bean only to find sj sitting on the toilet throwing up all over the fucking floor! GROSS! yeah that wasnt the worst part. stupid me when sj wouldnt open the door i climbed under the door and was lying on the floor and she fuckin puked on my hair! UBER GROSS :0(I was feeling pretty damn good obviously cuz all i did was laff @ the stupid wench loloh the best part was the fuckin cab drive home. she's passed right the fuck out and bean and i are appologizying out the ass for how drunk we all are and for sarah jayne too. the cabbie is like "if she's not okay, make sure u tell me cuz if i have to clean out my car, it's a 50 dollar charge!" so bean's holding sj's head out the fuckin window....what a fuckin night!oh and if drew is serious about me and him, i totally did him wrong. well not really. i mean according the cencus of sj and bean no ground rules were laid. we didnt have the talk so i didnt do NE thing wrong i guess. i mean ryan and i just totally sucked each other's faces off on the dance floor. onthing serious. i didnt go home with him. mommy wouldnt let me lol luv u bean. i will thank u tomorrow im sure.okay enuff babblenight night ljmuch luvme;0)~xoxo~
