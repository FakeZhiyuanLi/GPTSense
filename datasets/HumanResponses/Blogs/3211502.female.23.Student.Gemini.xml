      TJ, Melina, and I decided to rebel against studying today. After having our weekly (more or less) breakfast-lunch at Reme's, we booked it downtown to the Upper West Side to catch 13 Going on 30, the new Jennifer Garner chick flick. Seeing as how the three of us are accustomed to watching Ms. Garner being all action in Alias, we were pumped to see her take on a more light-hearted, comedic role. After stocking up on snacks at Duane Reade (to sneak into the movie theater, of course), we headed to Loew's.   The movie rocked. Jennifer Garner is a great actress. The chick who played Tom Tom was good, too. But, to sum up (without giving away the plot and the ending), the movie had an awesome cast, cute plot (quite similar to Big), and an amusing ending. And, well, the movie made me a bit nostalgic for the '80s. The soundtrack contributed to that though. Fantastic music selection. Thriller, Jessie's Girl. Dude. I actually ended up buying the soundtrack off of the Barnes and Nobles website as soon as I got back to the Heights.   But, people, go see the movie if you haven't seen it. If I can skip out on studying (what happened to the gunner deep down inside of me?!) and pay $10.25 to see it, it has to be good, right? Right. Go. Now.

      My birthday is a little over than a month away. When I was younger, I LOVED my birthdays. Don't get me wrong, I still do. But, recently, ever since I turned 18, my birthdays haven't really been that hot. Back in the day, I used to throw huge parties, invite lots of friends, and have a spectacular time. But, once I got to college, everything changed. My kick-ass school-year birthday suddenly became one of those dreaded summer birthdays. So, in college, I resigned myself to having quiet birthday celebrations with my family and some friends.   Last year, though, things were a little different. My birthday fell right smack dab between the last day of final exams and commencement. So, since plenty of my friends were around, I was able to throw a little shindig. This year, though, I really don't know what to do. Yet again, my birthday is a "summer" birthday. I figured Garth would come out and spend the weekend in NYC with me or I'd go out to Boston and spend the weekend with him. But, OF COURSE, knowing my luck, my birthday weekend has to be his BUSIEST weekend at work.

      Let me just say that pineapple buns from Chinatown are GOOD. I used to LOVE them when I was younger, but, over the years, I guess I gradually lost interest. But, the other day, I was in Chinatown and bought one for old times sake. And, dude, my love affair with the pineapple bun was rekindled.   I ended up buying 8 buns for $4.00 (@ $0.50 a bun) and brought them back to Bard. I am ashamed to admit this, but the buns didn't last long. Despite their smooshed and sticky disposition, I consumed them pretty quickly. I think I'm going to have to make another trip to Canal to buy some more.

      Honestly, I'm happier than a pig in shit when I'm watching a medically themed show (or a non-medically themed show even) and they whip out a medical theme or phrase that I actually understand. For example, on this Thursday's episode of ER, Dr. Pratt and Dr. Kovac put an epileptic patient on an EEG to detect any seizures that she might have.   The patient had what appeared to be a seizure, but upon looking at the EEG (electroencephalography, mind you) results, Dr. Pratt and Dr. Kovac realized that she was having a pseudo-seizure. There were no spikes, etc. Apparently, she was faking it. I felt all smart-like, since I actually understood what they were talking about. These are the times when my love for neuro returns. And, from next week's previews, it looks like this same patient is going to undergo a psychiatric assessment. Sadly, I don't have the same kind of love for psych as I do for neuro. Shame, isn't it?

      Score! Melissa and I have an apartment. Tower II, 20B. After hovering around the Housing Office door and patiently (or not so patiently) awaiting our turn to make an apartment pick, we were finally able to select an apartment. Since our draw number was a lowly 20 out of 26, we had resigned ourselves to having to settle for what would obviously not be our first choice apartment.  Amazingly, everyone and their mother wanted to live in Tower I and didn't really care about move-in dates, so Melissa and I were able to snag one of the two apartments we wanted. The earliest lease start date is 06/1/2004, so that means that I will be living Tower-style in the summer. No more Bard, baby!

      This is the latest I've been up in months. It all started with the AA Meeting on the Upper East Side. The meeting was followed by Bubba Gump Shrimp, Co. in Times Square. That ended with a food coma and a drunken stupor. Now, I'm sitting in my room, staring off into space, and wondering why the room is slightly spinning. Oh, wait. I know. My hair cells are floating in endolymph!

      Word on the street (and that street would be Haven Avenue) is that everyone who wanted a 2 bedroom Tower apartment got one. Hopefully, this rumor is true. Or else I'm going to go "Angry Little Asian Girl" on the Housing Office.

      I had a horrible horrible nightmare the other night. Only I would be capable of such a nightmare, though. In my dream I was taking the histology practical exam. I had studied my ass off and was hoping to do well on the exam. After going through a page worth of questions, I realized that I was totally going to kick ass on the exam. And, let me tell you, I should have known this was a dream/nightmare, beacuse I never feel like I'm going to kick ass on an exam.   However, suddenly, the questions no longer pertained to histology. Instead, the questions seemed to focus on the entertainment world. Who is Britney dating now? Why did Penelope and Tom break up? Things of that nature. Now, let me tell you, I used to know everything about the entertainment world, but, sadly, all that information had to go when I realized that I actually needed to study in medical school. So, as soon as I saw these entertainment-related questions on the exam, I burst into tears. Again, only I would freak out like this. Thankfully, it was all a dream.  There's no way that Taube would ask questions about Nick and Jessica, right? Right?!?

      Someone out there must want me to eat chocolate. First, there was the Death by Chocolate event for the prospectives. I went, but valiantly fought against the urge to consumer any chocolate. This morning, my prospective gave me a bar of dark chocolate, containing 71% cocoa. Then, when I entered the Black Building, the public health students were holding a dessert-filled bake sale. Honestly. I'm trying to count calories here! Finally, I gave up. When I got up to PH17, I broke down and had a piece of the chocolate bar. I know I know. I'm WEAK.

      My father bought tickets to see Madonna. Yes, Madonna. When he told me, I laughed at him and told him that I didn't realize that he listened to Madonna. Understandbly, he was insulted. He then proceeded to point out that Madonna is 47 years old, aka old. I then pointed out that just because Madonna is 47 years old, that didn't mean that she catered to an audience of people from her generation. But, anyways, eventually, he told me that I could to the concert with my mother if I was able to go home that weekend. Yay (weak).

      What luck. I totally pass out during lecture #1. Sucks to be me, right? But, no, wait. When I wake up, I find out that lecture #2 is going to be pretty much the same as lecture #1, except with a French accent. Ooh la la.

      And there I was...It was 9PM and my TV was locked onto ABC.. I was looking forward to a new episode of Alias... when, to my disgust and dismay, there were Nick and Jessica, singing and starting an hour of ridiculousness, also known as "The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour" or something like that...

      I celebrated my twenty-third birthday this past weekend (officially, my birthday was on May 29th, for all those keeping track). As always, my birthday fell in the calendar vicinity of Memorial Day, so one of my first birthday gifts this year was a three-day weekend. But, seeing as how the school year ended and I haven't really started work yet, having an extra day added to the weekend didn't really stir up the usual feelings.   For various reasons, I decided to spend my birthday in Boston:   (1) Since the school year ended, most of my med school friends took off running for the hills and have gone away for the summer. And, those who decided to rough it in NYC for the summer were, for the most part, spending the holiday weekend with family or taking a mini-break. So, there wasn't anyone in NYC to celebrate my birthday with. (2) I've been missing my Boston friends (phoq-all!) and the good old times we used to have in Cambridge and Boston proper, so I thought that if my friends were free, Boston would be the best place to celebrate. Also, several of my friends are graduating and moving onto the next phase of their lives, so, sad as it is to think about it this way, this would probably be the last time I'd see all of my friends together in one big happy group. Thankfully, phoq-all was free for the weekend, so I was able to haul up to Boston knowing that I would be able to celebrate with friends.  (3) Apparently, months ago when Garth was signing up for shifts at work, he hadn't fully realized that my birthday was this particular weekend in May. As a result, he signed up to work ridiculous hours this weekend. So, he couldn't come out to NYC to spend my birthday weekend with me. Since I wanted to spend at least part of my birthday with him, it further cemented my decision to go to Boston.  Rather than give the full play-by-play of my birthday, because I don't want to bore readers and, more importantly, myself, I'll just give people some major highlights:   Friday:  * Opting for a new travel experience, Greyhound, after finding out, to my dismay, that the Chinatown buses and Amtrak were ridiculously sold out this weekend. For some random ass reason, it totally escaped my mind that traveling would be a bitch this weekend since it was Memorial Day weekend. * Braving holiday travelers and traffic with a bus driver who (1) bitched at me when I asked how long the trip would be, (2) stopped on the side of the highway so he could take a piss in the bus's bathroom, and (3) made a random ass stop in Framingham to drop off passengers. * Fighting the urge to buy a McFlurry while waiting for the 10:40PM commuter rail in South Station. Note: I arrived at South Station at 8:30PM, but had to wait for this particular commuter rail train since Garth wouldn't be able to pick me up at Kingston until after 11.  * Having Garth hand me his birthday present for me when the clock struck midnight and it was officially my birthday. He got me an IPOD! 15.0 GB, mind you. And it was wrapped all pretty-like with white paper and a big pink bow.    Saturday:  * Roughing another commuter rail ride back out to Boston. Honestly, I'm getting to be such a frequent commuter rail traveler, it's ridiculous.  * Having to buy new shoes. Being the brilliant packer that I am, I forgot to bring shoes that would match my outfit. So, rather than spend the entire day wearing my black/pink New Balance sneakers, I hauled over to The Tannery, a store in Harvard Square that has fabulous, but expensive shoes. I headed straight for their Camper collection and saw an adorable pair of Twins. Despite their ridiculous cost (though, I did talk the price down), I purchased them. Well, I needed shoes and it was birthday, so I felt that it was okay to splurge. * Meeting up with the crew (phoq-all) at ABP in Kendall Square. Ahh, ABP. The memories. Anyways, after the initial double take at seeing Lee, Adrian, Kitty, and Hubert driving up in Lee's Ford Focus, I hopped into the car with them. Where were we going? Andover, the location of Lee's former high school, Phillips Academy at Andover. Yes, that Andover. The one where GW went to school. Let me just say that Andover puts my high school and probably a lot of other high schools to shame. After a brief stop at a restaurant that can only be described as an upscale Denny's, we wandered around Andoover's sprawling campus.  * Getting one of the fortune cookie invitations that Adrian cooked up (haha, I'm so punny) for my birthday party. There were two huge fortune cookies with a cute "fortune" inside. Major props to Adrian for organizing a fantastic birthday celebration! I've definitely missed celebrating birthdays with the phoq-all gang.  * Realizing that we had reservations at the Boston Fire and Ice at 6:30PM and that we had to haul ass back to Boston if we wanted to meet up with Justin and Xian and make our reservations. But, of course, we had time to stop at McDonald's for a chocolate sundae (dollar menu, baby).  * Buying a $3 box of bandages at Shaw's so that (1) we could get our Prudential Center parking lot ticket validated and (2) so I could relieve the pain that comes with breaking in new shoes.  * Having a kickass birthday dinner at Fire and Ice. Delicious food and awesome company. After totally pigging out on the various offering at Fire and Ice, we all attempted to finish off the Ice Bowl (serves 2-4) that I had ordered. Since our attempt was lame and weak, we decided to liven the experience up by starting a game of "Never have I ever," which let me just say was an eye-opening experience. Not only did we finish off the Ice Bowl, but I also learned a lot of new things about my friends and confirmed my suspicions that I am ridiculously unpure. * Having to find "open" bathrooms in the Pru. After drinking my (small) portion of the Ice Bowl, I drank a crazy amount of water, so that I wouldn't get sick. I had an hour-long commuter rail ride ahead of me and there was no way that I wanted to get sick on the commuter rail. I probably drove everybody nuts with having to go to the bathroom every five minutes. Okay, that's an exaggeration. * Stopping off at Krispy Kreme's. Okay, so I am so glad that Krispy Kreme's set up shop at the Pru after I graduated and moved away from Boston. If I still lived in Boston, I would seriously be there all the time. It's already hard enough having to walk by the carts selling mediocre pastries and donuts on West 168th Street. How could I say no to Krispy Kreme's?! * Getting birthday wishes and love in the forms of phone calls and e-mails from various family members and friends. If you called and/or e-mailed me, THANK YOU! * Eating yummy birthday cake. When I got back to Kingston, Garth surprised me with birthday cake! He had been talking about getting me birthday cake the night before, but I figured he'd be so busy with work that he wouldn't get a chance to get the cake. The cake was delicious!  * Deciding to go back to New York City the next day since (1) I was too tired to think of anything to do (and make the necessary phone calls to make plans) to keep myself busy until Garth got out of work and (2) traffic would be horrendous on Monday.   Sunday:  * Taking the my last commuter rail ride of the weekend. Due to extreme exhaustion, I promptly fell asleep in my seat. Hopefully, I didn't scare anyone. I must have looked like hell. * Getting reasonably-timed tickets for the Fung Wah Bus back to New York. Despite getting to Chinatown at 10:15AM, I was able to snag a 11:30AM ticket back to New York. This was particularly stellar since I figured everyone and their mother, like me, would be trying to beat Monday traffic by leaving on Sunday. * Making it back to New York City in three and half hours. Thank you crazy Chinatown bus driver. I honestly don't know how they can make the trip in three and a half hours. It's insane. Again,I promptly fell asleep in my seat and was, for the most, asleep for the entire ride back to NYC. I defintely bothered the guy sitting next to me. But, hey, it's not like he didn't bug me. Dude, I'm sorry if you're tall and big and the seats aren't that comfortable for you, but, really, you don't need to invade my space. Seriously.  Okay, that's it. Sorry if I've bored you. But, if you've made it this far, I must have kept your interest. Somehow. But, anyways, another birthday, another year older. :)

      This is funny, yet kind of sad. I'm 23 years old (as of yesterday) and I'm no closer to being as independent and self-reliant as I would like to be. Sure, I've matured and grown wiser (though, this is up for debate as well), but I'm still fully dependent on my parents. For money, mostly. And, sadly, money is what makes the world go 'round. So, for the most parent, my parents exert ultimate control over my life.   Obviously, there are several pros and cons to this situation. The biggest pro is that I don't have to work or necessarily worry about money. I always know that if I'm running low in cash, I can ask my parents for a refill. However, these cash requests have to be within reason as I learned today and many times previously. But, there are cons too. I have to explain myself fully whenever I make large purchases and whenever I need more money. My parents do give me a lot of leeway, but it's just really frustrating to always have to explain. Especially now.  This feels like such a whiny excuse, but, really, being in medical school and living in New York City really does lead to spending fluctuations. When school is really intense, I won't spend very much money on clothes and luxury goods as I don't have time to go shopping, but I will spend more money on snack foods to keep up my energy level for marathon study sessions. And then, when there are lulls in the workload (like now, with summer), the spending will go up. I have nothing else to do with my time and need to find things to do to pass the time. And, sadly, in New York City, things are expensive.  Sigh.

      Shrek 2 is the best movie ever. I just saw it for the second time today. If you haven't seen it yet, where the hell have you been?! It's a fabulous movie, with a kickass soundtrack. I'm not going to give away any of the juicy plot lines, but I've never laughed so hard in my life. Sorry to be gross, but, honestly, there were a couple of times when I thought I was going to pee my pants.   This is what I miss about my pre- med school life. Before medical school, I used to have time to just hang out, watch movies, go to concerts and, quite frankly, do nothing. When I'm in the throes of classes, I have very little time, if any, to do this/that kind of stuff. This is my last summer vacation ever and I'm going to do my very best to enjoy it. Hopefully.

      Yup. 1 year down, 3 more to go. I have officially finished my first year of medical school (of course, this is assuming that I passed all of my recent exams and have a "passing" average). I find this mind-boggling. Granted, this year has been intense and the information I supposedly "learned" and the "work" that I apparently did was definitely a years-worth, but, dude, I totally don't feel like I'm 1/4 of the way there.  And, besides that, what the hell am I supposed to do with myself now? Coming back to my room after the exam, I found myself with nothing to do. I guess that's a *good* thing.

      Indulge me, please. Let me dork out. So, after a pitiful (and, let me reiterate, PITIFUL) showing on the last Histology practical, I've been obsessively-compulsively (well, not really) studying for the upcoming final Histology practical. And, after doing some preliminary review/studying, some things are finally clicking into place.   For example, the intercalated disks. For those unfamiliar with these histological structures, they are junctions found in cardiac muscle tissue. They have lateral and transverse components which, before today, contained junctions that were beyond my comprehension. Today, in Hammer 412, I had an aha! An epiphany, if you will. It's all coming together. I'm LEARNING. Who'd have thunk it?

      I don't know how I feel about Extreme Makeover. Part of me feels like such dramatic surgery is only necessary in the most dire circumstances. The people who are on the show don't really seem like they need it. It seems like they have emotional issues that they need to resolve and they're using the plastic surgery as a quick fix. But, don't get me wrong, the people who are on the show do seem to be dramatically affected by their "makeover."   Anyways, watching this show made me think back to my "makeover." I didn't turn in a video to ABC proclaiming how badly I needed one. I just got dumped by a guy and that motivated me to take action. After obsessive-compulsive exercising and borderline anorexic behavior (just kidding!), I am the me that I am now. :)  Here's me in 2001. Aka the "before" photo:

      I'm ridiculously behind in SBPM. But, that's another story for another time. So, anyways, today I was catching up in all of the SB reading that I have to do and I was reading the syllabus entry entitled "Endocrine Pancreas." In the syllabus, there was a brief discussion about the two different types of Diabetes Mellitus. As I was reading about diabetes, I thought back to my first encounter with diabetes...  When I was in elementary school, I was addicted to the Babysitters Club series. I loved reading about the adventures that Kristy, Mary Anne, Claudia, Stacey, Dawn, Jessi, and Mallory had with baby-sitting, school, boys, and family. I owned every book and eagerly awaited the release of the next books in the series. Anyways, in the third book in the series, entitled "The Truth About Stacey," I learned that Stacey, the transplant from NYC, had diabetes. Diabetes was the reason why she couldn't have sweets and had to go to the doctor all of the time. Aha!   And, from what I learned today in my SBPM reading, Stacey must have had Type I Diabetes Mellitus and had to have been controlling her disease with injections of insulin.

      Ever since that Neural Science Clinical Demonstration ended, I've been on the verge of tears. And, finally, when on the phone with Garth (I hid it from him, though), I broke down. One of the patient presentations in the Clinical Demonstration was extremely sad, yet inspiring.   The patient, RS, was in his early 50s, and had been diagnosed with Huntington's Disease (HD) about three years ago. During the patient presentation, the neurologist leading the demonstration conducted a cognitive evaluation of the patient. From the patient's responses as well as his speech and demeanor during the presentation, it was apparent that he was suffering from various cognitive difficulties.  Throughout the presentation, RS's wife was sitting right next to him, helping to answer questions and giving her perspective. I kept watching her throughout their segment of the clinical demonstration. At times, she seemed to look embarrassed, but, for the most part, she looked like a woman who was sad, yet trying so hard to be strong, not only for herself, but for her husband as well.   And, what was extremely touching about RS and his wife was that the love that the two of them shared was so apparent. At one point during the presentation, when RS noticed that his wife was having an emotional reaction while answering a question about how the dynamic of their family has changed since his diagnosis. He reached over and affectionately rubbed her shoulder and arm. Later on in the presentation, he wished the class well and hoped that we would all be able to find someone like "P" (his wife) to have in our lives.  It was so sad at the same time. With HD, it seems as though RS's situation can only worsen. And the disease will not only affect his own physical, mental, and emotional health, but it was also greatly impact his family as well. I couldn't help but feel sad and want to cry.

      I did the unthinkable today. I was HANDY. The toilet wasn't cooperating and, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. Just to make this story complete, let me just give you the details. The toilet wouldn't flush. And, apparently, the previous flush didn't take. The toilet bowl was refilled with water and there wasn't any new water entering the bowl, but there was still the sound of water movement. I called the off-duty emergency super, but, unfortunately, there wouldn't be a handyman until tomorrow morning at the earliest.  What's an un-handy girl to do? I called the boyfriend. Before I wasted my time and his, I asked him if he knew anything about toilets. He said yes. So, I explained the whole situation to him. He asked me if I had looked at the tank yet. I answered with a "What's the tank?" He told me to look inside the tank and see if anything was disconnected. So, I sucked it up and looked in the tank. The plastic part attached to the handle was apparently no longer attached to the part it was supposed to be attached to. I informed Garth of this. He told me to attach it.  After double-checking and triple-checking (okay, and maybe quadruple-checking) with him to make sure the water in the tank was clean, I dug right in and re-attached the handle to its long-lost friend. I flushed the toilet again and, after jiggling the handle a bit, everything seemed to be in tip-top shape. I then called the off-duty emergency super again and informed him that I (well, I did all the work, really) had solved the problem. I did go downstairs, though, to fill out a service request. Just in case. So, until the handyman comes to double-check my work, there is now a post-it note on the door reminder bathroom-goers to use the toilet with caution.

      Hi, my name is Irene (Hi, Irene!). And, I'm a french-fries-aholic. I've been french-fries-free for the past five months. When I first started out this anti-french fries trend, there were a ton of other foods that I had waged war upon. These foods included: muffins, donuts, brownies, cookies, bagels, etc. Basically, I promised myself that I wouldn't eat anything that tasted deliciously good and was horribly bad for you. Pretty much, I ended up caving and resumed consumption of these foods (except for donuts, thank you). However, I've been faithful to the anti-french fries movement.  However, Wendy's decided to fuck with me today. Usually, I'm very good about ordering any food in a french-fries friendly environment. I avoid consuming anything that might come with french fries. So, today, I ordered the Ultimate Chicken Grill sandwich. The lady at the register asked me if I wanted the combo. And, I told her no. I just wanted the sandwich. But, apparently, it didn't register (Oh, I made a funny!). When I got back to the apartment and peered inside my Wendy's bags, I noticed FRENCH FRIES sitting right next to my sandwich. The horror!  So, I promptly threw away the french fries and fought off any urges that I had to consume them. Surprisingly though, I didn't really feel really any urges. I just stared at the french fries as was like "Oh." Good to know. You really can fight off your cravings. Maybe I'll re-think the South Beach Diet again.

      Okay, who remembers that show in the late 80s/early 90s on PBS called Ghostwriter? I really can't be the only one who watched that show? For those of you who weren't fortunate to catch this show in its heyday, the premise of the show was that there were a bunch of kids, who were brought together to solve crimes/be friends, by a "ghostwriter." And, when I mean "ghostwriter," I mean a ghost who writes to them and whose messages can only seen by these kids, also known as the "Ghostwriter Team."  So, anyways, once these kids bonded and realized that they shared such a "special" secret, they decided to team up. Each team member received a kickass black pen that they would use to write to "Ghostwriter." And this pen brings me to why I'm writing this random ass entry in the first place. I just picked up a pen to make my "to do" list for tomorrow. As I was writing a note to self about depositing a paycheck, it hit me that the pen I was using was exactly the same kind of pen that these kids used. Small freakin' world, no?

      I read this  urlLink article  earlier today and I remember thinking to myself, "I'm going to be just as calm and collected as Katie Couric if I ever get stuck in an elevator." And then, I chuckled to myself, because in my 23 years on this earth, I have never gotten stuck in an elevator. So, who knows when something like that would actually happen to me?!  Well, what do you know? It happened today, just six hours after I read this article. I entered one of the Tower II elevators on the lobby floor, pressed the button for the 20th floor, and watched the elevator doors close behind me. After a couple of seconds, I realized that the elevator, which had originally been moving, had, for some reason, ceased to move.  Uh oh. So, immediately, I thought back to that article about good ol' Katie and I reminded myself to stay cool. I frantically (yeah, I'm so cool, I'm ice) scanned the elevator buttons for the "call for help" button. I finally find it. At the bottom of all the buttons. I sit down on the elevator floor (getting ready for what would hopefully not be a long wait) and press the button.  After a minute or so, someone finally answers. Thank god. I tell the help guy about my predicament - "I'm stuck between floors." He tells me he'll see what's up and promptly hangs up on me. And, of course, I think to myself, "What the hell am I supposed to do now?" Well, thankfully, the elevator starts moving.   I'm so glad that I'm such a frequent reader of the gossip columns. If I hadn't read that article today, I would never ever have known what to do today. But, because of the National Enquirer and Katie Couric, I stayed calm, cool, and collected in a stuck elevator today. Go me!

      Today, Anita and I hit up Bryant Park for the Sony sponsored free Dido and John Mayer concert. Weather.com gave a 70% chance of rain, but we figured we'd be able to beat the odds. As I was walking to the subway station, there was a torrential downpour in the Heights, but I still had high hopes for downtown Manhattan.   When Anita and I met up at 42nd Street and 6th Avenue (also known as Avenue of the Americas apparently), it was cloudy and starting to rain, but we decided to tough it out. During the opening act, Ari Hest (Barry Zito loves him and I love Barry Zito, so I tried to pay attention), the rain was intermittent. When Dido got on stage, it started pouring. The rain did stop every now and then, but, for the most part, everyone had their umbrellas out.   Dido finally got off the stage after what seemed like two albums worth of songs. Finally, it was John Mayer's turn to hit the stage. Well, one would think and one would like to hope. But, no. They made us wait nearly half an hour before he started to play. In the meantime, the rain continued to pour and seemed to get harder. Add the lightening and thunder to the mix and you know we had a good time.  When John Mayer finally came on stage, he only sang FOUR songs. Dido sang like fifty and John Mayer, who Anita and I pretty much came to see, sang only four. Not fair at all. Apparently, the man didn't want John Mayer to die. Oh well. At least he sang "Your Body is Wonderland." That almost made waiting in the rain worth it. The free Sony stuff sure did help, too.  I'm such a sucker for free things. Free concerts, great. Free concerts and free stuff, even better.

      Last night, Anita IMd me to let me know about a free John Mayer/Dido concert taking place in Bryant Park this Thursday. We're planning on hitting that up Thursday night, but that's not really the point of this entry. Anyways, after talking to Anita, it finally hit me that there were probably tons of free events like that going on in the city. Yeah, I know, it took me a while to realize this, but, as you all know, I'm kind of slow like that. So, I immediately started looking up all the NYC sites that I know of and found some pretty good listings of summer events. So, maybe this summer won't be so boring after all. Thank god.  In particular, on the NY Metro website, I found a listing for a reading by Helen Fielding. For all of you who are unaware of who Helen Fielding is (shame on you!), she is the author of Bridget Jones's Diary and its sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. I love these books like crazy. They're really what started me on my whole obsessive chick lit phase. I decided that it was definitely something I wasn't going to miss. Thankfully, I was able to convince Anita to join me, so I wasn't all by my lonesome in Barnes and Nobles.  The reading was pretty cool. Helen Fielding read a couple of chapter of her new novel, Olivia Joules and her Overactive Imagination (or something like that), and did a Q&A session. Her new book really isn't quite as good as the Bridget Jones series in my opinion, but it's still quirky. Anyways, after the reading and the Q&A, Helen Fielding did a book signing. I ended up buying copies of all of her books and had her personalize and sign all of them: "To Irene... Helen Fielding." Yes, I know, I'm crazy.  Side note:  One of the girls who asked a question was apparently on American Idol. Helen Fielding recognized her as "Scooter Girl."

      I had four tickets to go watch a taping of The View today. Even though I RSVPd for the tickets, I decided not to go. I only just started work a few days ago and I didn't really feel right about taking the morning or the whole day off. I didn't really do that much work today, but, still, it wouldn't have been that good of an idea.  But, because I am who I am, as soon as I got back from work, I had to look up who the guests were on the View today. I don't really care for the women who host the view, but I would have died if the guests for today had been people I wouldn't have wanted to miss. But, anyways, I didn't miss much.  According to the website -- Today's guests: The cast of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy; summer gift ideas with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck; a fashion show showcasing options for co-host Star Jones' upcoming wedding, including the bridal party, the groom, the bridesmaids and the mother of the bride. I'm SO glad that I didn't go now. If I had gone, I would have been so pissed off. And, I really don't need that kind of stress.

      Damn bugs. I really don't understand why they like to bite me so much. And why they have to be such a nuisance. They almost ruined what would have been an extremely romantic moment. After dinner somewhere in or near Cape Cod, Garth took me to this little spot in Duxbury where his mother used to take him when he was little. We had to walk down this long path across this grassy field to a cute little rock formation overlooking the water. We had just missed sunset, but it was still gorgeous. We sat down and were attempting to bask in the calmness. But, unfortunately, the bugs had other ideas. They were seriously attacking us. We tried to bat them away, but that didn't really work. After battling the insects for a few minutes, we gave up and decided to wander back to his car.   I almost thought that we had escaped bug bite free. But, unfortunately, the six or seven bug bites on my body prove otherwise. Why do they have to be so itchy and be located in such hard-to-itch spots? I hope Garth fared better than I did.

      Last Friday, Melissa and I signed our lease and snagged the keys to our new apartment - Tower II, 20B. Finally! Now all that lies ahead is moving in (slowly) and setting up what will be our home for the next three years.  We've already moved some stuff in. We hit up Bed Bath and Beyond and Filene's Basement and bought some stuff for our bathroom, kitchen, and living room. We can actually eat, cook, use our bathroom, and watch TV in our apartment now.   I'm starting to slowly move all of my crap over to the apartment. I didn't realize that I had so much stuff. Garth is coming on Monday to help me move. I really am that pathetic. I'm the type of girl that needs her boyfriend to come help her move. Though, I am going to try to move as much little stuff as I can. Garth can help me move the big, heavy stuff.  I'll post pictures as soon as I am all moved in and I have furniture. Furniture, for the most part, will have to wait until my mother comes to NYC. There are plans to go to Ikea to get the major pieces of furniture - desk, dresser, bookshelves, etc.   But, yay, I live in the real world now. I'm like almost a grown up!

      Interestingly enough, I'm actually doing both. I've been working hard to get everything together so that I can start my research project for the summer. I've been setting up meetings, trying to get approval, working on grants, etc. But, at the same time, I haven't actually started working. New issues keep popping up and I have to work with my mentor/supervisor to resolve them. Who knew that there were so many things to keep track of?!  Hopefully, everything will get resolved and I can start working. I've been really pumped about getting started and actually doing this research. I have two grants lined up ($$$$) and I'd hate to have to decline them, because of unforseen circumstances. But, really, it wouldn't be that bad if I had to turn down the grants. All I want to do is get some clinical research experiences, work with my mentor/supervisor, and actually do something productive/interesting this summer.  I'm going to call my parents tonight to ask for advice. It's really frustrating that things have gotten so complicated. Hopefully, they'll be able to set me straight. I was really counting on the grants, so I could take some of the financial load (even if it was just a small portion of it) off my parents. They've been totally kick ass about paying for my medical education and being my ATM while I'm in medical school. We'll see what happens. Things always go from sucky to better to another kind of sucky and then to another kind of better.

      I've been dying to upload songs to my brand-new iPod (Thank you, Garth!), but I've been hesitant to do so until I've gone through all of my songs and checked to see if they are all okay. Yes, I know. I'm anal retentive. I'm almost done updating all pertinent song information and after that's done, I can get started checking to see if the songs are all okay.  I suppose I could just upload songs and then delete songs as necessary if I find out they aren't really quality. Okay, maybe I'll do that. Maybe then I can get cracking on that Excel spreadsheet I'm supposed to put together for work.

      My eyes are itchy, I'm all stuffed up, and I sneeze at least twenty times a day. Yes, I have allergies. If only I knew when this all started. I talked to my mother today and we both decided that this allergy thing must have just recently popped up. In Cali and in Boston, I never really had this problem. But, sadly, in New York City, I'm suffering from allergies like no other. I've tried Claritin and it sort of works. But, I'm in desperate need of something more potent. So, tomorrow morning, as soon as I drag my ass out of bed, I'm going to head to student health and snag a prescription for Flonase!

      Today, I helped Anita move into her new apartment on the Upper East Side. I know. Unbelievable, isn't it? I, Irene, actually did manual labor. Especially, after I had Garth do all the heavy lifting and moving for me when I moved into 20B. But, I wanted to be helpful and, upon hearing that Anita was moving into a 5th floor walk-up, I decided that I had no other choice but to be a good friend and help out.  So, this was quite an adventure. To sum up, in short, not only did I fall asleep in a Uhaul van, but I seriously sweated through all of my clothing. Now, bear in mind, I was wearing a tee shirt and jeans, which are really hard to sweat through. The jeans, especially. Changing later, I realized that I had sweated through my padded bra as well. And that bad boy is thick (C'mon now. To achieve maximum boobage, one really needs a lot of padding). But, in the end, the move was successful. We were able to move all of her stuff into her new place (which is really adorable by the way) and not be too overly exhausted.  Maybe I should start a moving business? Nah, I don't think so. Manual labor isn't for me. I'm more of a manager type. I can delegate. Instead of picking up a piece of furniture, I would definitely be more comfortable telling someone to pick it up, move it, and put it someplace else. Yes, that would work very nicely.

      The other day, as I was getting ready to head out, I noticed Melissa and Mary watching "Dead Like Me," this television show that they had previously been raving about. Since I wasn't really in any rush, I sat down and watched the first half of the show with them. I really did have to see what all the hoopla surrounding this show was all about. Apparently, this particular episode was the season premeire of Dead Like Me's second season on Showtime. After a couple of minutes, I was intrigued. Unfortunately, since I had to go downtown, I had to stop watching the show. But, I made plans to watch the episode the next day on Showtime on Demand.  After watching the episode again, but, this time, in full, I discovered that the series was definitely worth watching. Sadly, Showtime didn't have the first season available on demand, so I made the impulse decision to purchase the entire first season on DVD (I know, I know. Impulse decisions and me? Who would have thought?). I did this promptly, using Barnes and Nobles. A couple of days later, the DVD set arrived (Yay for faster delivery in Manhattan). I have since watched the Pilot episode and I remain in awe. This show kicks ass.  Now, excuse me, I must go watch Episode 2.

      I tried calling Garth a couple of times earlier this evening, but, everytime I called, I was sent straight to his voicemail. I found this strange, because he usually keeps his cell phone on. After the sixth or seventh time I tried to call him and I kept finding myself reaching his voicemail, I was about to (1) kill the computerized woman responsible for voice mails and/or (2) break into tears.   Now, don't worry, Garth and I have been dating for more than a year and a half, so I wasn't about to cry because I was worried that things weren't going well. Nope, being the secure girlfriend that I am, I didn't worry that he was with someone else, avoiding me, and/or getting ready to break up with me. No, instead, I was the panicky medical student. For some irrational reason, I convinced myself that he had probably gotten into some kind of accident and was in a hospital bed somewhere unable to call me.   Obviously, I had no choice but to work myself into a big frenzy over this. As a result, I found myself completely unable to fall asleep. So, I sat in my bed, stared at the wall, and hugged Schlepp tight. Yes, we were both worried about Garth, so we tried to comfort one another. Finally and, thankfully, my cell phone rang around midnight. It was Garth! Something urgent had happened at work that he needed to take care of, which was why he was unable to answer his phone and/or call. Apparently, a fight broke out (a bench clearing brawl, mind you) during this softball game that his work was holding. It sounded pretty bad. But, thankfully, no one was hurt. So I'm very relieved.   Unfortunately, I am still unable to fall asleep. Though, the last two yawns I just experienced might be evidence to the contrary. So, perhaps, I should crawl under the covers and try to hit the sack. I bid my readers adieu (a multitude, I know) for now.&nbsp;  Also, of note, I feel like a complete idiot for overreacting. Girls. They're crazy.&nbsp;

      I'm experiencing the lazy days of summer, so I have been spending a large amount of my spare time reading both new books and some of my old favorites. The last two nights, I have been reading one of my favorite books, Memoirs of a Geisha, written by Arthur Golden. It is a fabulous book and I love it.  Recently, I found out that they (as in Hollywood) are making a movie based on this novel. This film is being produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Rob Marshall. Hopefully, they won't ruin it. But, i am excited to see how the novel will be played out on screen. Rumor has it that Zhang Ziyi the star from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" has snagged&nbsp;the title role. The movie starts filming in September of this year and will be released in 2005. Can't wait to see it!

      I have been dreading this moment since the beginning of the summer. Tomorrow, I have to give a powerpoint presentation of my summer research project to a group of other medical students who have received the same research grant. I absolutely hate giving presentations. I am totally the type of person that dislikes getting up in front of a group of people and talking. Hell, in high school, I even refused to talk in class even though it cost me participation points and dragged down my overall grade.  But, the day has come. I have spent the past hour or so practicing my presentation, so that I don't sound like a complete idiot tomorrow. I suppose I will practice again tomorrow, just in case. What makes matters worse, or interesting, rather, is that my boss/mentor might be there when I make my presentation. On Sunday, I sent him a copy of my slides, so that he could look it over and give me recommendations and corrections. He told me that my slides looked excellent, gave me a few tips, and then asked when and where I would be presenting, because he wanted to come. If he doesn't have to be in the OR, that is.   I am flattered that he is so supportive. I don't recall any other mentors coming to their students' presentations. But, this does make me extra nervous.&nbsp; Hopefully, things will go well. Wish me luck.

      Three days and two excruciating bus rides later and I'm back in New York City. And, for a while it seems. I currently have no other trips to Boston planned for the near future. No worries, though, as everything is great with Garth. I just have to live the rest of my life, the parts that I've been neglecting these past couple of weekends when I've been in Boston.  I love getting packages. When I arrived back at good old 20B, there was a package from Amazon awaiting my return. Score - it was the new Ashlee Simpson CD, Autobiography. Okay, I"ll admit it. I love "Pieces of Me". And, I am currently semi-addicted to Ashlee's MTV reality show (and her sister's as well, since I seem to be divulging all). I've been grooving to her CD off and on for the past few hours. Good times. And chomping down on Double Chocolate Milano cookies.  It seems as though Operation: Garth's Birthday present will have to wait until tomorrow.

      Today, I was enjoying a nice cozy evening in, when the doorbell to the apartment rang. I wasn't expecting anyone and my roommate has a key, so I didn't know what the hell was up. I walked over to the door, opened it, and this guy proceeds&nbsp;to tell me this story: "I was supposed to borrow a pot from your neighbor, but he isn't in. Do you have a pot that I could borrow? I need to cook pasta. I'll wash it and have it back to you in twenty minutes."  In shock, I said "Sure." I didn't know what to do. During the next twenty minutes, I worried that I wasn't going to get the pot back. I mean it wouldn't be a big loss if that pot never returned, but it matches all of our other pots and pans. Thankfully, the doorbell rang again, and there he was with my pot, freshly washed.   It was a very strange night. Okay, so who thought I was talking about another kind of pot?! Ha.

      I was informed by Garth&nbsp;today that the iguana (aka Cosmo) was trying to be cuter than me. How dare he/she (we are unsure of the reptile's sex)! Apparently, the little guy/gal was attempting to move the vacuum and get it all positioned in a way that he/she could rest on top of it. Now, I can interpret this situation in two ways: (1) he's trying to clean the house and trying to upstage my cleaning efforts from last weekend or (2) he misses me terribly and is clinging to the vacuum because it was something that I had touched/used.   Your guess is as good as mine. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter interpretation. He loves it when I touch him. I do give a good rub down after all. Wink, wink.&nbsp;I'll have to investigate when I see him this weekend.

      Now, isn't this sad? According to an Associated Press report, Kirsten Dunst and Jake Gyllenhaal have broken up. How can that be? After adorable beginnings (his sister, Maggie, making the love connection) and them making out all over the country, they seemed destined to survive the traditional Hollywood relationship fate. But, no. Their relationship is O-V-E-R. I wonder why it ended. Maybe it's because she's annoying as hell. That might be it.   I wonder who gets custody of their dogs?

      As I have mentioned before, I am sort of like a migrant worker. I pretty much&nbsp;work when and where I can.&nbsp; For the most part, though, I am able to work in this one office. However, I share that office with a few other people. Among these people, I rank the lowest on the totem pole/medical hierarchy. When these people need to use the room and the internet connection, I leave them be. Thankfully, I am able to snag a few hours of alone time a day so that I am able to get some work done. &nbsp; But, let me get to the point of this entry - today was an especially interesting day. A group of new fellows just started working in the department. I hadn't really met any of them yet, but that was to be expected, since they don't really spend that much time sitting on their asses in the office that we share (unlike me). But, today, I got a chance to meet one of them. When I first got to the office, he was on the phone, so I wasn't able to introduce myself. Later, though, in the main office, we had a brief introduction. However, our more interesting encounter was later in the day. When I was heading back to the shared office with some files, I walked in on the fellow as he was changing into scrubs. We both turned beet red. I could not have been more embarrassed. Thankfully, he seemed relatively chill about the whole situation. I don't think I could handled it if he ended up being really pissed.

      Honestly, it takes real love to endure a four hour bus ride from New York to Boston and then another four hour bus ride from Boston back to New York. I don't know how I do it. I don't know how he does it. But, it must be done. Otherwise, we would never see each other. I suppose we could just dump each other and start fresh with someone more local, but, no thank you.

      I figured that I should probably update this blog before a months goes by and I totally forget about the blog entirely. I cannot believe how delinquent I have been in regards to creating new posts. From now on, I resolve to make an update at least once a day. However, this does not mean that every single post will be deep and/or thought provoking.  My lack of posts is a direct result of having my mother and little sister come to visit. They arrived at JFK on Saturday, June 20th. My mother left a week later and my little sister just left this past Friday. During their visit (3 weeks long in total), I've been busy attending family functions, keeping them entertained, tagging along to college visits, buying an insane amount of furniture/household items for my new room/apartment.  But, now I am all by my lonesome yet again. I really do not know how to keep myself busy. Especially in the aftermath of all the non-stop action these past three weeks. When my mom left and I was left in charge of my little sister, I tried to keep her as busy and as entertained as possible. What did we do? Too much.  Some highlights: * The Boy from Oz. Vanessa really wanted to see this and it was definitely one of my must-see Broadway musicals. After waiting for over an hour in the TKTS line in Times Square to find that the musical wasn't even one of the musicals with tickets for sale, I booked it over to the actual theatre. There, I was able to snag Student Rush tickets for the same, if not a better price, than TKTS. Let me just say that Hugh Jackman is H-O-T in Leopold form, Wolverine form, and, amazingly, flaming form. * Keith Foulke sighting. While we were walking down Broadway in Times Square, Vanessa noticed Keith Foulke (aka the traitor/defector) walking in the opposite direction with his wife and baby. We are not 100% ure that it was him. But, if Keith Foulke has an Asian wife and a half-asian baby, it was definitely him. * The Central Park Zoo. This was my second attempt to find this elusive zoo. The first attempt was with Garth. After walking from the west side to the east side and back from the east side to the west, we were unable to locate the zoo. This second attempt was with Garth and Vanesssa. After asking four vendors in total, we finally found the zoo. And, thankfully, it did not disappoint. Of note, a polar bear doing laps and live turtle porn. * July 4th at A60, the rooftop bar of the 60 Thompson Hotel. Partied with assorted family members (Aunt Nora and Uncle William were staying at the hotel over the 4th of July Weekend) and Nicole Kidman. Yeah, Nic and I. We're tight.  I can't remember anything else. I really should have written some stuff down. Lesson learned.

      I just watched this movie called "Bring it On Again." It was the unfortunate sequel to the movie "Bring it On," which starred Kirsten Dunst. Unlike its predecessor, this movie wasn't very good. It wasn't even good enough to make it into the movie theaters (and we all know that some sucky movies still make it that far). Instead, this sequel went straight to video/DVD.  And, rightfully so. It was horrible. The plot had some hope, but the dialogue and the acting was horrendous. Some classic lines include: "Make like a Tom and Cruise," "He was all over you like ugly on an Osbourne," and "If you put make-up on a pig, it's still a pig."  What a waste of film.

      My boys did it again. They totally kicked the Yankees' asses today. 13-4 was the final score. Anita and I arrived in the Bronx during the top half of the third inning. Sadly, the A's were down 1-4 at that point. However, pretty soon after, things started turning around. We left during the top half of the eighth inning when the score was 13-4, the A's. We, like almost everyone else in the stadium, figured that there was no way that any team, let alone the Yankees, could get back on top with such a deficit. We were right. Final score was 13-4. I know I've already said that a bunch of times, but, baby, the score is just too beautiful.  I'll back in the Bronx tomorrow for Game 2. This time with Garth. Maybe I'll even wear an A's tee in honor of my boys and my baseball boyfriend (sorry Barry, when you start winning more games, you can replace him), Eric Byrnes. AL player of the week, baby!
