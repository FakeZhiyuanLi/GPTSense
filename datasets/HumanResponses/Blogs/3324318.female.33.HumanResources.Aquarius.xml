      Pastor Paul preached on forgiveness. I was surprised to find out that it wasn't another person that I needed to forgive, it was me. I constantly beat myself up for things I do wrong, sleep in too late, spend too much on the computer, eat the wrong things, don't exercise, don't do my personal prayer time, don't disipline the kids, disipline the kids too much, temperment, depression, not the Prov 31 wife and the list could go on. With forgiving myself, I also need to not be so hard on myself. Take one thing at a time that I want to change and devise a goal, with God's help. I have to figure out what is the most important thing to me that I want to change. I would have to say it's sleeping in and how depressed I feel when I wake up. I just feel like I wish that the morning never came, I wish I could go back to bed. If my 2 toddlers weren't there to wake me up I would stay in bed all morning. The night time at 1am is when I have the most energy, motivation and happiest. I also want to start to play my guitar again. Ok, no more. I would love for everything to just fall into place at once, but I don't want to try to do too much at one time. That, I have learned only leads to depression, frustration and loss of hope. Well, I should go to bed. Tomorrow morning is not a good time to start since I'm, again getting to bed so late.

      My Prozac Rx stands at the pharmacy because I didn't have my insurance card or my credit card. I should go tomorrow to go pick it up. It's just so hard to get the kids ready and Amber to be happy for the 1/2 hour car ride. Not to mention the cost of gas. Not sure if what I'm feeling is depression or just plain laziness. If it's just being lazy or unable to figure out what to do next, will it really help? I did better at my house work today because I made a list and stayed focused. If it wasn't for Amber I would have gotten a lot more done. But I do love to hold her.  The two toddlers fight all the time. I think the reason why she has such a hard time to get to sleep at night is because it's too quiet in the house.   I figured out a way to not get so mad at Becca and Noah. I tend to see their side of it. I can understand Noah for wanting that cool toy that Becca has. At the same time I can understand Becca keeping all for herself because after-all it is her's.  Amber is crying again and it's hard to type w/ 1 hand.

      Today Amber is 2 weeks old. She looks older and is starting to loose those newborn qualities. I suspect that she is going through a growing spurt because all she wanted to do was bf, all day. I thought that I was dry but when I was bfing her the other side was leaking like crazy. I really don't want to have to wear a bra all the time.  My moods have been 1/2 and 1/2 lately, meaning that I could slip into my depression very easily. Spending time with Pam on Friday helped. I really need a good girlfriend. How will I do that when I'm so far away from everyone in Peshtigo? I love the house and the open space of country it has.  Next week I want to post the birth story, and get it edited. Still feel uncomfortable with a diary, but I think it would help me out with depression issues. I just want to be motivated and be able to accomplish all the things in my head. I need a challenge, to feel good about myself and enjoy life again.

      Today was better. I got the kitchen cleaned earlier and supper in the oven a lot earlier. I was still way to tired in the morning and slept too long. I need to move Noah's bed so I can get him to sleep in just an hour more. 6:30 every morning is just too early.  The kids took out all my can goods to go "grocery shopping" and now they're all over the living room. I hope they put it away just as they took them out.  Last night I bought a flag page for Andy, it was $40. I feel a little bit guilty about it and afraid what Kevin might say if I tell him. I think Andy will greatly benefit from it though.  I have to clean the desk off before Kevin comes home. He hates it when it's a mess and right now it's sticky and salt all over the place. I also have to go to the library to return an over-due book. I'm not even done reading it. Oh well. I have 2 holds for the kids, one Dora and the other Strawberry shortcake.

      Today Amber is 11 days old. It's amazing how much she has grown so far. She's a very happy baby. She fusses when she's hungry. The only time she really cries is when she's uncomfortable or spooked like when one of the other kids move too quickly. She smiles a lot. She's awake for about 5 hours a day. She likes to look around and listen to the noises. She has big eyes and they are very alert when she's awake. Her face is very round like Becca's was. She has little ears and a little mouth. Her eyes are a dark blue. I expect them to change to brown or hazel like Becca's did.  Becca and Noah are constantly fighting about the simplest things. They are always crying or screaming at each other. I hope this passes soon. It's the noise that bothers me the most. I can't make them both happy.  I'm mostly depressed and tired all day, mostly in the morning. I just can't seem to get motivated. I don't want to deal with another day. I just wish it was just Amber and I. I wish that she was my first and not my last. I wish I could take naps with her. I wish I could just sit with her and watch her, but Noah and Becca start screaming or fighting. I lose my temper easily. Then when I try to spend time with Amber all I feel is guilty.  I really need to get out of this depressed state and start loving my 2 toddlers again. I feel like I'm falling out of love with them and replacing them with Amber. She's just so perfect and I want to give her everything. All I can see with Becca and Noah is their faults. I can't wait until Becca goes to school so she's gone most of the time. I don't feel guilty about not home schooling anymore. It's just not me and I'm really looking forward to just Amber and I. Of course Noah will be there for 2 years. Hopefully Becca will have full day of kidnergarden. It would be good for both of us.  Today's goal is to think of how to get out of this depressed state and start living my life again. I'm just wasting away, letting the days slip by. I feel like nobody would even notice it I left this life. Everyone would be much better without me. I'm not thinking of suicide, just I don't know what I think anymore. I'm just tired of everything. Tired of feeling this way. I told myself after I had Amber that this is my turning point and things are going to be different. So far they're worse than before. Something has to change and since the kids are well kids, it's up to me to change them.
