      It another normal day. For particular this day, i just wanted to keep myself in a quiet world. Silence is a devil. It makes become dumb with my own expressions of feelings. A person has to be active and lively. I've fallen in love with silence. I want nothing but just a silent atmosphere in this world. Just for this particular day. I don't wanna talk to anyone. Neither do i wanna listen to anyone. All along, i'm still a loner after all. Just feel particular sad and depress for today.

      Everyday to me, is filled with unexpressed feelings that all mix together... How should I do in order to hear the reaL answer from my bottom heart? Seeing couples on the street, i do feel happy for them, but somehow all around i am alone one self. I have envious before, jealous before and even cursed before, but the one that truly belongs to me still haven't appear. Or perhaps, he appears in front of me, it just that i have missed it... I don't know myself. I always thought i have love this guy whole-heartly but it the end, i found out that i actually never really loves a person before. I mean, i already hate myself that how could i possibly loves a guy, not to mention whole-heartly... Now i told myself, don't yearn too much of it, or you'll never get it... But somehow the more i don't care, the more i become heartless. I become more cold to the people i know... I told myself that, this is not my fault, its all my future love force me to. I know all these are excuses for me to carry on with myself. If i don't find excuses for myself, i doubt i can live until today... I am just stubborn in this way. It was because love turns out to be too scary for me. I fear it for i have been deeply hurt before in other ways. Frankly speaking, nobody will care how a person feels unless you care for that person. I doubt that there will be people who care to read at my blogs too... I don't expect too much in return, as long as i can find a way out of this reality world, and freely expressed all my agnoy and worries, i'm just fine with it... Love is a burden for human being but somehow people still yearn for it so much... Aren't we too lonely? I always do believe that there is more than in life. I doubt the thing is love. I do admit that it brings happiness to people but if it only works out to the people you love. Or else, hell shall it turn... People gives love many definitions but which one is true, which one is false?  PS: why do i think about it so much? when love comes, just fall in love and that's it...

       Saturday has always been my favourite night.   Because by the mid-night, I would think of what i did in the day.   Oftenly, soft and smooth musics will be played when I do my reflections for the day.   This was the time I could just simply listen to the classical and new age musics, and enjoy the soul and emotions of the composer.   It was like the composer and me had already been interwined together.   The closeness feelings was indescibable.   Back to my normal, daily life.   Recently I've watched a Korean movie acted by Kim Rae Won(a new actor full of potential and bright future) and Moon Geun Young(the little EnXi in Autumn in My heart).    This fabulous movie is entitled My Little Bride.   It belongs to the category of comedy-romance.   To me, it was so touching and lovely.   You just couldn't imagine how much laughters and tears were given to me when I watched this movie.   To those who simply love Korean stuffs, this is one of the 5 stars rated movie I greatly recommend.   Ha!Ha! It seems like whenever I wrote my blog, I always recommend movies.   To those who reads my blog, don't be freak out cuz I just can't help sharing my love of movies to everyone I know.   Even if it is in daily life, I always recommend those movies I like very much to the people around me.   August is around tomorrow.   Time flies fast and in a wink, my GCE O level Chinese result will be release soon.   Like others, I will feel panic and nervous too.   God knows how much Chinese meant to me.   I could never ever done badly in Chinese.   It seems like the only thing I am confident that I can fully excel in it.   If I ever gotten a bad result, I guess I will possibly be devastated and will not be able to stand up and have confident back.   Well, I guessed enough of it. I just need to told myself always look on the bright sides of life.

      Recently, I have watched the romance movie, The Notebook. It was directed by Nick Cassavetes and the story originated from Nicholas Sparks's famour novel, which is also the title of the movie, The Notebook. It is about a man who's in his 80s told a story from his notebook to a woman who is in his same age too. The story that the man told the woman actually bringing back the life of a young couple. His name is Noah and her name is Allie. This movie basically belongs to those literary-romance type. The movie touched my hearts. Currently, I'm also searching for novels written by Nicholas Sparks. His articles are so fanstastic and heart-rending too. Well... As for heart-rending, I think some of his novels are. For those who really know how to appreciate those literary-romance type movies, I greatly recommand The Notebook.  A small quotation that i've found over the net.  Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited...It is never rude or selfish It does not take offense, and it is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes.  ~ 1 Corinthians 13:4-8

      I've just watched the movie 'A Walk To Remember'. To me, the impact is so big. I've already had a long time never has this emotion. The main leads are Shane West and Mandy Moore. It is about Landon(West), who's skating through high school on looks and bravado till one day an incident happened to him and it begins a new life for him.  It was because he had met a preacher's daughter whose name is Jamie(Moore). She's a person whose self-confidence doesn't depend on the opinions of others. It was kind of a touching and sad story first written by Nicholas Sparks and directed by Adam Shankman. This movie reminds me of a story about an angel. This angel was sent by the god to bring happiness and meanings to some certain people in the Earth. Her job is to learn the true meaning in a person's life. As well as to leaves a memory in everybody's mind when she was surmon back to the god. When she was in Earth, she likes every other normal children who went to kindergarten, primary school and finally secondary school. At the age of 14, she was required to go back to the side of the god. Before she went back, the god put her into a test. The god made her to feel weak days by days and wanted to test what she have learn throughout the time in Earth. She have learned how to loves a person unconditionally, have faith in someone whom other people think that the person will never succeed. She also learned that even when she in the worst situation that a person could ever had, she still full of hopes and dare to dream for what she wants to achieve. Sadly to mentioned that before she can fulfill all her dreams and goals, she was summon back to the god. The god asked her one last question before she grew back her wings and fly to the sky, which is "Do you have any regrets?" She replied:"Regrets? Sure I do, it was a pity that I didn't get to stay by his side in the future but I get to loves a person with whole-heart and this person returns me back the love too." The god said:"No! You do get to stay by his side forever. For you have leaves him a full ocean of precious memories and his heart will always be remembering you." The angel was thankful to the god for sending her this mission to Earth. In the end, the angel went back to the god and pray for those who needs love. The fact is this angel did really leaves a full ocean of memories for those that once walk with her in her life journey.

       Today is weird.   I'm not feeling as happy as I was yesterday.   There's two things that had been going on in my mind.    1st.    Without much efforts, I keep thinking about it oftenly.   I know I had to move on.   After all, it was me who suggested a break up.   It was me who never even try with whole efforts to change for better and raise the white flag to surrender.   Though I hate to admit the fact that I am the one, who is selfish, immature and stupid.   I should at least keep on trying to communicate with him.   Now he's all well blessed with an angel.   The angel I guessed he had been searching for ages, who totally care and concern about him.   Unlike me, I was a timid coward who is trying to find the best way to escape from problems rather than solving them.   With sincerity and whole-hearted, I wished him happy always although my heart still do felt heavy sometimes.    2nd.    Almost all who are familiar with me knows that I had a crush on a guy for 5 to 6 years.   However, in the early this year, I've decided to stop my obsession.   There's no need an explanation, because there's forever could not have any sparks between us.   Its not that I have not tried hard enough, its just that I'm tired.   I could not find any reasons to carry on my crush on him because there's been no improvement.   Similarly, he is also well-blessed with an angel.   Words are not my forte at the moment now.   I'm speechless.   Feelings that left to be describe but not describe, are feelings that usually holds with significant meanings.   Without hesistation, he is one of the important person in my life.   Now, I don't know...
