        Plans for the garden are taking shape and growing! I have spent hours working in the space - getting to know the space, really. Now I have committed my ideas to paper, staked out the areas, and know the features I am going to install. The place will be pretty 'raw' the rest of this year but the construction will be in place and ready for next year to be started on time.   I am adding a small pond for effect and for the wildlife. The herb garden will be distinct from the vegetable garden. The back bed of the vegetable garden (4'x40') will be set up for cutting flowers. Despite the mission of Frog Pond to be "native" in its plantings, a little fancy flowers make the place look nice!   New animals and birds were seen this week. Cedar wax-wings and killdeer are new to my sightings here. The hummingbirds are in full action at the feeder and the bird boxes are fledging nests. Summer is upon us at Frog Pond!   The first tomatoes are set on the vines in the garden and the beans are blossomed. The pumpkin vines are growing well and all in all things seem to be doing fine. A little rain this week would be nice.

        Summer is here and is off to a roaring start. Everywhere there are plants growing and blooming, birds singing, and wildlife getting on with the business of life. The Father's Day hummingbird feeder went up yesterday and within 10 minutes, the Ruby-throated hummingbirds had found it.   There is not enough time to blog everything that goes through my mind about Frog Pond. Five minutes of sitting on the porch swing provides a lifetime of material to think about and write about. Fortunately, it is a lot more fun to get out in to the land and work with it as opposed to write about it! Maybe when the land sleeps this winter I can catch up on my writing...   Every day I fall more in love with this place. The pace and the connection with the land is so much more interesting that life in the city. Maybe I will never go back...

       There are 15 bluebird boxes up at Frog Pond and today we took a long walk surveying them all. We found a little bit of everything; wrens in a couple boxes, tree swallows in others, and even some bluebirds! Most of the nests had eggs or chicks in them - it is the prime nesting season for most song birds.   One of the tree swallows was calm enough that we were able to pick her up off the nest and hold her. She was not thrilled with being handled but we were successful in getting her back on the nest without incident.   Need to create a little log of the boxes, conditions, and nests. One more thing for the web site!

       One of the primary chores in front of us is to catalog the current flora and fauna at Frog Pond. We need to create some basic bio-survey in order to have a "baseline" of data. There is no need for this to be a scientific survey, but I think we will collect our notes in a variety of ways and keep reasonably accurate records.   Organizing the data will be a challenge. I believe we can start small databases; one for flora; one for birds; one for other fauna. The bird information is different enough from other data that it might merit its own database. On the other hand, if we begin to catalog insect life, that might create a new database need. All of this needs put on to the web site.

        This is the opening post to this web log. It is our hope that the ideas here are of some value to the reader and that interested readers will share their experiences, questions, and feelings. Frog Pond is part of the world we all live in and this blog just might be a way to extend the community of Frog Pond beyond the traditional boundaries of geography.
