      Yes.&nbsp; I am that obsessed right now that I'm going to&nbsp;blog about Nora Roberts.   As you may know, the  urlLink ESN  (Endless Summer Nights) Fics have been up for, oh I don't know, I guess like a week or so.&nbsp; Anyway, I had been looking forward to them for so long.&nbsp; And I was really bummed that I didn't get to participate since I forgot about the last the date to submit applications.&nbsp; I guess that worked out for the best because I had a bunch of things to do and wouldn't have been able to finish and end up flaking out on  urlLink Liza , and that would have sucked.&nbsp; As of now, I have only been able to read a few of them....... and I blame it all on Nora.   Here's the story: &nbsp;I had some extra money.&nbsp; My dad, who is so nice and cool and spoils me a bit, gave it to me.&nbsp; I still don't understand why.&nbsp; Maybe 'cause I was graduating.&nbsp; So, I had extra money and I went to this amazing new bookshop that I discovered.&nbsp; And if you've ever been in Guatemala you know that bookstores are hard to find, and even harder to find are those who carry US authors.&nbsp; I can actually count them with the fingers in one hand.&nbsp; Three.&nbsp; Yeah, 3!&nbsp;   So you can guess just how excited I was when I discovered this third bookshop.&nbsp; I was incredibly happy about it.&nbsp; I think I spent like 2 and a half hours in it.&nbsp; And the bookshop is like a whole in the wall.&nbsp; I guess if you want to get technical, the size of it's, maybe, 225 square feet or so.&nbsp; And they had a big selection of Nora Robert's books.&nbsp; I was in heaven!!!   I love NR's books.&nbsp; Last time I counted them I had like 25 or so.&nbsp; Which I think it's a lot considering I discovered her like a year, maybe two, ago.&nbsp; I always wanted to read Chesapeake Blue but held out because I wanted to read the first three, right? And I was walking up and down the selection and I found all four books.&nbsp; All four!! I was soooo happy.&nbsp; And I started reading them like six days ago; I'm currently on the third one, Phillip's story.   When I went to NYC a couple of months ago I got "The MacKade Brothers", both books, and I fell in love with all four brothers... well, maybe not with Shane.&nbsp; Oh, but Rafe! OMG!!! I wish I could run in to a man like that.   I like the stories better when they are from the guys "POV", or the guys perspective.&nbsp; And the MacKade's were four brothers who had raised hell in their town.&nbsp; Especially Rafe.&nbsp; It was fun to read the parts in which they met their girls.&nbsp; Comments like "That girl sure knows how to walk" or stuff like that.&nbsp;   The men in her stories are always perfect.&nbsp; I mean they're gorgeous, well built, have amazing eyes...... and I'm a sucker for eyes..... at the end of they story I find myself wishing I would run in to some guy like that.&nbsp; The type that are man's man, but have this side to them that would definitely make you tremble.&nbsp; It actually makes me wonder if there are actually men like that out there.&nbsp; God knows that I haven't found one of those.   And now, with the Chesapeake Bay saga I am falling in love with the brothers too.&nbsp; I don't know if you've read them but I'll give you a brief story: This are three guys that were adopted by the same family.&nbsp; Each one had a really sad story, and this same family adopted them.&nbsp; That way they became brothers.&nbsp; The mother died.&nbsp; And the father died afterwards in an accident, months after he had adopted a fourth kid.&nbsp; But the other three were already in their 30's and had to live everything to keep a promise to their father.&nbsp; Each book, of course, tells the story of each brother.&nbsp; Book 1 tell's Cameron's story.&nbsp; Book 2, Ethan's.&nbsp; Book 3, Phillips.&nbsp; And Chesapeake Blue tells the story of the last kid, Seth.&nbsp;   So I'm currently on the third book, almost done with it.&nbsp; And I am loving all of them. So I guess, that when I'm finally done with them I'll get back to reading the ESN fics.&nbsp; I guess that one thing that is holding me back a bit is that I know that not all of the stories are up yet, that way, if I wait a bit more I'll be able to read all of them at once.&nbsp; Makes sense, huh?   Ok, so, I'm leaving now.&nbsp; Off to eat some popcorn.

      Remember how I told you about my friend that didn't show up to my graduation party? Well, we had a major fight.&nbsp; I mean huge! It&nbsp;was awful; it felt as if I had been breaking up with a boyfriend.&nbsp; That awful! She said some pretty nasty things to me like:  I had other friends that I wanted to celebrate with  or, my personal favorite,  I didn't have an obligation to attend. &nbsp; Some friend, huh?  Of course she was under no obligation to attend! But I didn't know friendship was an obligation either.&nbsp; I mean, if she had called me and said "I won't be able to make it" I would have understood.&nbsp; I mean it was a special day, but I wasn't holding a gun to her head to come to celebrate with me.&nbsp; But I would have appreciated that she came, of course I would have.&nbsp; But when someone calls you and says "I won't be able to make it," you understand.&nbsp; At least they are taking the time to tell you about it.  Oh, and then she had the nerve to ask me not to change.&nbsp; That her friendship was  unconditional .&nbsp; Some balls! How can you actually say that your friendship is unconditional when you said horrible stuff like that?&nbsp; I should have given her a dictionary as a present once.&nbsp; I could still give her that, and highlight the word unconditional so that she knows what it actually means.&nbsp; It fucking pisses me off!!  Oh, and the next day... she called me to ask if I wanted to have a cup of coffee with her.&nbsp; Can you believe that? What is she doing? And the day after that, she asked me to go to lunch.&nbsp; I couldn't believe that either.  The thing that pisses me off the&nbsp;most is the fact that I considered her a "sister", the kind you have by choice, not blood.&nbsp; It hurts like when a drop of lemon falls on a cut.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I don't even understand her.&nbsp; It's as if she forgot what she said and thinks everything is just peachy.&nbsp; Well not on my side, it's not.  We have a weekly lunch with my friends every thursday.&nbsp; Last thursday, she didn't attend it because (she said to one of my friends) "she thought I was mad at her".&nbsp; Funniest thing is, and I didn't know this little fact, she had left a very pissed of message on my cell on wednesday night&nbsp;in which she stated that  "if you're mad at me it's your fucking problem"  and slamed the phone shut.&nbsp; Worst part, I didn't hear the little message until thursday night.&nbsp; My bet is that she didn't really attend the lunch because of her audiodisplay of madness towards me.&nbsp; Who's with me on that?  But this is the cliffnotes version of the story.   Anyway, I feel so many things at one time in regards to that.&nbsp; I feel sad and upset, mostly though.  So, um, sorry for rambling on like this.&nbsp; I just don't really know what to make of it.&nbsp;   Tomorrow is thursday, so it's lunch-day.&nbsp; We'll see how that goes.&nbsp;

      Have you ever wondered, is there someone out there that considers life "easy"?  If I'd ever ran into a person that considered life easy I would stop them, treat them to a cup of coffee, maybe something to eat if we were close to a mealtime, and ask them what makes life "easy"? Because in my experience life is anything but....  The school system here is so different than in the US at least.&nbsp; When you finish all your courses, you don't graduate a few days later.&nbsp; You just finished classes.&nbsp; Then you have to go through the grueling process of finishing you thesis.&nbsp; In my case, I had a problem with my thesis advisor.&nbsp; She didn't turn in any of the work I had done to my faculty.&nbsp; So when it came graduating time (which usually occurs every six months) I didn't have any of my thesis credits because the bitch didn't turn anything in.&nbsp; So I had to go to the faculty board and later on the school board to ask them to see into my case.&nbsp; I "wan", I guess should be the most proper word.&nbsp; The school fired that advisor.&nbsp; But who would give me all that wasted time back.&nbsp; I mean, it's not as if they were going to validate all the work that I had put into my thesis.&nbsp; So I had to start over.&nbsp; And I got to see a bunch of my friends without me.&nbsp; It fucking sucked! I would have loved to have graduated with most of my friends, I was glad for them and I still partied with them, but I felt as if I had been robbed from something that was "mine".  So then I had to start over.&nbsp; But I had the blessing that my thesis advisor, was actually my advisor in school, AND I had been a TA for her philosophy class for two years, so she knew me.&nbsp; She helped me so much!! Not only in my school work, but in pushing me to do something that I was so reluctant to finish.&nbsp; I didn't even want to graduate!!! I didn't care for it!!!!  And then, I finished.&nbsp; But in between this time, I took a few months off in which I spent time in Texas and worked on my thesis away from home.&nbsp; Worked on my  First  thesis, away from home.  But now I have new worries.&nbsp; EMPLOYMENT.&nbsp;  That  should be a curse word.&nbsp; If you don't have it then it's as if your life is worth nothing.&nbsp; Here is a normal conversation when someone is unemployed:  "Hey!" "OMG, Hi!! How you've been?" "Great, working my ass off." "Really? Where?" "Oh, I work at this PR firm..blah,blah... how 'bout you? Where are you working?" "Oh, I'm not working yet" GASP! "You're not? How long have you've been out school?" "Quite some time." "Shouldn't you be looking for a job by now? You can't depend on your parents for ever.&nbsp; You are 25"  And the whole conversation goes down hill from there.&nbsp; Advice.&nbsp; Comments.&nbsp; How life is great when you work.&nbsp; The importance of being independent.&nbsp; Freedom.&nbsp; Freedom.&nbsp; Freedom.&nbsp; And then comes the dreaded phrase  "You know what I'd do?"  or  "What worked for me was..."  most of the time what would immediately follow those lines would be things like "ask your dad if he can tell his friend 'insert name here' to see if he can get you a job", "Don't you know the owner of 'insert company name here'", and the best one "Doesn't your dad work with 'again, insert name'.&nbsp; I mean, why can't he get you a job with them"  Don't you people think I know that?!?!! I abso freaking lutely know that!! Hell, I've been to all this interviews, left resumes, filled applications.&nbsp; But just because I'm coming they're going to say "Oh, here comes Mary, we have been expecting you.&nbsp; Here's a job we've created just for you.&nbsp; Glad to have you on board with us."&nbsp; If it were only that easy, I would have had a job after the very first interview I went to.  Being unemployed puts me in a fowl mood!!  I am so sorry for have ranted through all of this.&nbsp; If you still finished this particular blog, is because either you identify with it or you have time to kill.&nbsp; For whichever reason I am very thankful for that.&nbsp;   Anyway, I'm off.&nbsp; Thanks for reading!   &nbsp;

       I was talking to Jayta tonight, and she asked me if I had Cinn's blog.&nbsp; I told her I hadn't.&nbsp; She told me to check it out, so I did.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Turns out that that post was going to be her last.&nbsp; I was incredibly surprised, as was Jayta.&nbsp; And my guess is, many other Trories also.&nbsp; So I guess this for Cinn:     &nbsp;    Hon, I don't know what happened and what are the reasons for such a sudden decision.&nbsp; What ever it was, or is, I hope that you can work through it soon.&nbsp; You will be missed.&nbsp; I will look forward to seeing you around at the thread.&nbsp; I always enjoyed talking to you and reading your blogs.&nbsp; You're one of the nicest Trories I've met.&nbsp; You were always one of my favorites.&nbsp; And you still are, even if we won't get to see you as often or see what you're up to.&nbsp; Anyway, I just wanted to say goodbye to you.&nbsp; For what is worth, you know where to reach me if you need anything, or anyone to listen (or in our case read you).     I'll be around.

      I graduated on Saturday! The whole ceremony took only 50 minutes, and it started on time which is not a common thing to happen on any kind of ceremonies in this place.&nbsp; It was nice.&nbsp; I got to do my hard-rock signs, which earned me a glare from one of the persons in the schoolboard.&nbsp; I could have flipped her the bird.&nbsp; But didn't.&nbsp; Instead I did it again when someone stood in front of me to take pictures. lol.&nbsp; The thing about my school is that they are extremely catholic.&nbsp; It's an Opus Dei University.&nbsp; So you can imagine all the things that probably popped into her head when she saw me do that.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And then the party.&nbsp; Think of Janice (Chandler's annoying gf, in Friends) when I say this:  Oh my God!  I had 14 different types of liquor to make different kinds of cocktails (martinis, cosmopolitans, Long Island Ice Tea, Sex on the Beach, Tequila Sunrise, etc) and we finished  everything !! I mean, I,  alone , finished a bottle of Kalhua.&nbsp; Funny thing about Kahlua.&nbsp; It has almost,  almost , the same Alcohol content as Tequila.&nbsp; Did I know that? NO! But I do now!!! &nbsp; Something that really pissed me off that day: Both my best friends didn't show up!! Some friends, huh? I thought that I might cut them some slack, because, let's face it, things happen.&nbsp; One of them left to the beach.&nbsp; The beach! I mean you can go to the beach every other day, it's not far from here (1.5h) but did he care? NO! How often do your best friend graduate? Let me tell you, not every day!&nbsp; And then, my other so-called best friend left to another party.&nbsp; You know what I think?  F**k them!  I am really pissed.&nbsp; Worst thing is that neither of them has had the decency to call me. &nbsp; But anyway.&nbsp; The food was amazing.&nbsp; The music was great.&nbsp; My mom, cried; my dad, cried; my grandma, cried; my aunt, cried; my brother... took pictures.&nbsp; But we were really happy.&nbsp; Not all of the all-of-a-sudden 48 guests showed, but it was OK.&nbsp; Apparently there was a slight miscalculation because the food was just enough for the 35 that did show.&nbsp; So it all turned out for the best. &nbsp; And now, I have to figure out what I have to do.&nbsp; The best part of life, the one where you know what you have to do, is over.&nbsp; Now the uncertainty starts.&nbsp; If you want to know what else happens, keep checking this blog.&nbsp;

      There I was, wanting to post a comment for  urlLink Cinn  and when I pressed the comment-link thing it asked me to sign in... and this how this idea came about. And so I went and got myself a blog, since lately I've found myself with many things to say and not many people to say it to. My family doesn't even know I write fiction, because they would probably think it's a waste of my time and that I should do more productive things with it. My brother, karate-boy, would laugh in my face because he can't  stand  Gilmore Girls. So here I am, reaching out to people that have similar likes as  urlLink me .   I'm actually getting ready to graduate college on Saturday, and my family is coming over to the big thing. They are actually coming in today at noon. As great as this is, I will have to sleep in the couch with my brother next to me on the other couch... for two weeks!! Last time this happened, my throat ended in his hands.  Violent, you say?  Nah!   Party is also Saturday. There's going to be this big lunch that started out with 19 guests and last time I counted we were up to 48. How did that happen? I have no idea. Most of the guests are not even my friends, the good thing is that I like all of them so that is always good. And I am also getting  Chocolate Cake . So, just the cake is one thing that would make me not mind if I didn't know all of this 48 guests.   As for my writing. I just finished something, but Jewls (my friend who loves betaing) has it right now. I don't know, as of now, if it's going to work or not. Jewls is extremely busy because she has to beta two other fics that are going to be on the Summer exchange. So maybe next week I'll let you guys know what happens with it. If you want to check out something I've written, you can check it out  urlLink here .   So this is it for me and for now. I have to go to work, be ready at noon to go and pick up my family, and finish doing a bunch of things.... like giving out the invitations. Can you say,  Procrastinator ?

      Luke threw Jess in the lake as catharsis.  Or so Jess told Rory.  CMM says that OTH is a way of therapy.  And I am trying to find a way to do this exact thing.  So I am going to write something again.  As catharsis..... or therapy.  You know how everyone has this love story, that wasn´t really quite  love  but it is a  story .  I guess I should have titled this blog something along the lines of  About a boy , that might just be the title for what I am going to write.  Who knows!  I am sure of one thing, it will have nothing to do with the Hugh Grant movie.  I met this boy when I was 16.  And I fell  in love  with him, or as much as you can fall in love with a guy when you are dating someone else, and have been dating him for a while.... or maybe I was trying to get over from a horrible break up when my boyfriend had cheated on me with the one girl he swore he had nothing to do and wanted nothing to do with.  I don´t know, I guess it was a little bit of both.  So anyway, this boy was in my class.  I guess that I don´t need to say anything more that the fact that the guy was Italian.  Tall, dark and handsome.  Think of  Under the Tuscan Sun  with dirty blond hair.  Maybe it might be a slight exageration, but the boy was gorgeous.  I had seen him around in school.  He actually went out with a girl I didn´t find all that interesting and extremely annoying.  But when we met, I don´t know exactly what happened if I was dating someone else or he was.  The thing is that I think that we liked each other instantly.  There was this amazing chemistry that I hadn´t experienced with anyone else before.... or even after.  We started talking, he switched seats so he could seat behind me, we hung out.  We spent 7 hours in school every day... and after school we would call each other on the phone at least three times...... four if it was a wednesday, because of  The Wayans Brothers  (remember that TV show, I guess was one of the firsts from the WB) and we used to watch that show together.......... over the phone. lol.  Nothing really happened while we were in high school.  After graduation, that´s another story.  He called me up one day after it had been at least two months since I had broken up with my boyfriend (yes, we dated other people, never each other, and we always ended up right where we started.... no where!)  He had broken up with his girlfriend a few days after I broke up with my bf, and of course rumors started.  That we had broken up with our "significant others" because we wanted to date each other.  Gossip, what can I tell you.  But it proved to be true..... to some extension.  When he called me that day I was surprised.  Really.  I hadn´t heard from him in so long..... you know how two months can be when you´re 17.  He called me and asked me if I was doing anything that night (it was a friday) and I said no.  So he asked me out.  And we went out.  It wasn´t the best date ever.  Turns out this kid that he was somewhat of a "godfather" to, had gone out with his friends had many drinks to many and his friends were freaking out.  So we had to cut our date short and go look for the kid to drop him off at his house, and explain to the kid´s mom what we thought might had happened.  So after that we went for a drive.  We drove across the city (which is not that big) twice.  When he was going to drop me off at my house he asked me, "Mare, how come nothing ever happened between us?" And I was shocked! I mean the only reason that we never did date while we were in school was because he never asked and I was to chicken to ask myself.  So I told him that.  And then he asked  me if I wanted to give it a try.  Hell yeah!!! Of course my answer wasn´t as eager as the one in my head.  We kissed for the first time that night.  2+ years after we met.  Eight years have gone by since that day.  More or less.  And nothing ever did happen.  I mean, we went out on dates... but never really dated.  We would kiss, but he wasn´t really my boyfriend.  Did I love him? I never stayed with him long enough to find out.  I dated other people, and he dated a lot of other people.  He´s still dating someone else... I, on the other hand, am not.  Do I miss him? I don´t really know.  Maybe I do sometimes, when I remember something we did or something he did.  I guess that I will always miss him.  He was the guy who taught me how women feel when they are wanted.  He will always be a great mistery to me.  Once, a friend from school told me that he never heard him talk about a girl the way he talked about me.  That he wouldn´t let anyone talk ill about me, because he would get really pissed off.  That he would always get very deffensive if someone said that I was pretty or hot or whatever term guys use to talk about girls.  I would always kid with him and told him that he was behaving like some kind of dog pissing around a tree.  He would laugh and never deny the fact that he didn´t like other guys around me.  Now, at this time in life, I guess it´s not as fun to think that a person was acting that way towards you.  I always hated possesiveness and jealousy, but with him...... I think I never really cared if it was him.  I would get pissed off if one of my boyfriends behaved as if I was some kind of property to them or as if they owned me, but with him it was always different.  It never felt that way.  It should have, but it never did.  I actually "broke it off", and I use the term losely, a couple of years ago.  I had met this wonderful guy that was actually interested in dating me for more than once a month or whenever he felt like it.  This new guy would call me, and ask me out, send or gave me flowers.  And he was great.  So I decided that I needed to brake it off.  Start over with someone else.  It was one of the hardest things I ever did.   I remember that at the time I was also planning on moving to the US for my MBA, so I told him that we had reached a point in which we had to end whatever it was that was between us.  That I wanted to move.  And that I wanted to start over... without him.  He would stare at me as if he didn´t understand what I was saying to him or as if he knew that it was "this again" and I would forget it soon enough and everything would go back to "normal".  But "normal" had never been normal.  And that time it was trully over.  He left.  He got in his car and left.  Then he drove back and kissed me one last time.   I saw him last, last year in November.  Nothing happened.  I guess this time it was trully over.  So I will write about this.  A fic.  Trory.  The one thing I want to accomplish? My catharsis.  I guess I really want two things out of it.  My catharsis, and make those of you who know, what part is part of the fic and what part really happened.  Anyone want to beta something like this? lol.

      My dad is turning 50! Not yet though.... April, next year. But he is  soooooooo incredibly  excited about it. He's on a diet, and working out, because he wants to look  grrrreat  when the big 5-0 hits him.  My dad is the best, so's my mom. Our story should be written in a book really. We are actually Nicaraguan, but in '79 when the whole  sandinista  thing happened we had to fly. I mean, literally. My mom took me (I was 45 days old) and we moved to Guatemala. But we didn't know where my dad was, because he had been sent on some kind of mission. A bunch of women did the same thing as my mom, but others were lucky enough to leave together with their whole family. Three days later, my mom got this call that they knew where my father was and they were going to send for him. And they did. One week after my mom and I fled we got reunited with my dad. Other women weren't that lucky. My mom was 22, my dad 24.  But we had nothing. Do you remember in GG, when Jess goes to look for his dad and his dad says something along the lines of I got nothing... and then Jess gets pissed and says "you've got nothing.... I'VE GOT NOTHING!", well we were Jess. We had no house, no clothes, no cars, no bed, nothing! We had to start from scratch... or more like, my parents got to start from scratch and carry me with them. But God never left us. A few days after my dad got here, he found a job. Which was a blessing!  My mom got a job too, as a live-in maid sort of. And those people let the three of us stay there. A few months later, we were able to afford to move out to our own apartment. I was probably 7-months-old.  Life started treating us better, and better. God gave us amazing oportunities. Then we got my brother. And that was so great. My brother was born in December, and I was sent to school in January (the school year in Guatemala is from January to October, with a week off during March and two weeks during June). When I went to school I already knew the alphabet, how to write my whole name, the numbers up till 20, and I kind of knew how to read.  I have the greatest parents in the world. Do you know why? I never felt that I had nothing. I felt that I had everything I ever wanted. The only bad thing about it was that I didn't get to see my dad as often as every girl does. My dad's a pilot. He adores his job. It's the job that has supported  his family for so long. But at the beginning, this first job my dad got kept him out of the country for almost three weeks a month. But the days he spent with us were always amazing. We had fun. We would play baseball, or run around, or wake up at 4 in the morning and start watching Disney Channel, and then get up and do a stack of pancakes "a la Donald Duck". My dad has always made the most perfect pancakes.  Since we left Nicaragua and moved here, it's been 25 years. That's how old I am. And life has treated us so well. My dad has an amazing job. They put my brother and me through college. My mom doesn't work. He bought his dream car.... and then he bought one for my mom.  Same brand, except my mom's is more suited for a mom.  My brother and I have everything we need and more.   And now, he's turning 50.  There was a point in his life that he thought that he just might not make it.  That things were so heavy and so overwhelming that he wouldn't be able to get through them.  But he always has had my mom.  She supported him, when he thought that he might crumble.  And she never let him.  And we never did.   For his 50th birthday, he's not planning a big bash.  He's not planning on getting a new car to celebrate his half a century.  He's planning on a trip.  For all of us.  We're not going to Europe, since apparently I'm heading that way next year in September.  But we are going to New York (and I Loooooooove NY), Chicago and Washington DC.  Three of his most favorite cities in the US.  Although, I think that NY is in the plan more on my account than his.  I turn 26 exactly 10 days after he turns 50.  And my mom turns 48, six days after my birthday.  And mother's day is the day before my mom's birthday.   When I told him, "Daddy, why don't you take a trip just you and my mom?" he told me that he wouldn't have made it to 50 without thinking of us.  So I'm going to celebrate my father's 50th birthday! My dad is turning 50!
