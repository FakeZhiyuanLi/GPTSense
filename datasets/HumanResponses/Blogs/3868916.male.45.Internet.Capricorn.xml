      So the blog on the road didn't work as well as expected. One, connectivity wasn't as planned on the road. Two, blogging a road trip is sort of like taking photos; you're either in the picture enjoying it, or standing outside taking photos.  Anyway, we covered 7566 miles, 22 states (Washington, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsyvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming), in less than three weeks. The most memorable place we visited was the  urlLink Great Sand Dunes Nation Monument . My photos are  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here . The surealism of sand dunes the size of mountains with snow capped peaks in the background is definitely drug for the spirit.  Visiting  urlLink South Carolina  was great to see family and friends, but the oppressive heat was something I have long forgotten how to get used to.  Another fun place was Madrid, NM. A funky artist community, with one rocking bar, was definitely one of the "I'll visit again" places on our road tour. It was also nice to visit my friend Rob and his new family.  Nico and I decided Madrid and the sand dunes are both worth a return trip.  Some memorable moments from the road:  - Visting Ken and Lynn Miller in St Cloud. I worked with both of these great people at Michelin. Now Ken is a ME professor at St. Cloud.   - Visiting Nico's Aunt Nancy in Carlisle, PA.  - Stuck in a nasty KOA in Monroe, MI in the dark with nothing to do and Max starts the new game "In the future...". Sticking a flashlight in his face he states in booming voice "In the future, there will be five hundred channels..., and nothing to watch", we continue, passing the flashlight around.  - Having a guy with a mullet (drinking a beer at 8 am) and no shirt (if you've ever watched a "Cops" episode, you know that no shirt in public is an inch away from a felony), come up to the van when we were leaving Monroe to tell me I had a flat tire. The next day the kids say they saw him on TV. (It was "Joe Dirt").  - Overhearing a conversation between Max and Morgan on the road:     Max: "I'll probably try to become president a couple of times, and if that doesn't work, I'll become one of those people that makes people laugh; a Canadian."    Morgan: "You mean comedian."    Max: "Whatever."  - Our side road trip with Rob and family to that "Tent Rock" place. (too lazy to look it up).    One of my favorite lines from The Bhagavad Gita is "Action should culminate in wisdom", and I feel I learned something very special on this trip. When I left my hometown it was with the thought that I would return triumphant, with the fortunes of my travels. I realize that the fortune I found is the woman I married and the children I'm blessed with. The triumph is finding the best place to live in the US. Portland and Seattle are both jewels, and I can't imagine willingly moving from the paradise of the Northwest. Thomas Wolfe says you can't go home, just as Buddhism states you can never step in the same river twice. Home is where you make it.  It's good to be home.

      Well, connectivity wasn't as good as planned, so I didn't get to blog too much of the trip. Saturday was grueling:  Kids: What state are we in? Me: Montana. Kids: What state are we in? Me: Montana. Kids: What state are we in? Me: Montana. ...   Don't ever try to drive across Montana in a day, especially going west to east on i94, because at the end of the day you'll end up in western North Dakota and have to drive across half the state before you find a place to stay.  Anyway, we made it to Greenville on Saturday, and will stay until Thursday morning and then head out for New Mexico.

      We had a good first day. After crossing the cascades it got warmer. Eastern Washington can get old fast, and the curves though Idaho and western Montana can wear on you.  We detoured off of 90 and took backroads to get to Polson. It was definitely worth the detour. Polson is nestled between snow topped mountains to the east, rolling hills to the west, is on the shoreline of Flathead lake.   It really is a beautful and quaint little tourist town. Since it only takes a day to get here, Nico and I are planning to revisit when we have more time to explore.  I took pictures and was going to upload some, but realized I forgot the cable that connects my camera to USB. I do have a USB card reader with me, but it only works with one brand of USB card, which happens to be the card I didn't use. Oh well.  Right now I'm leaning on making our next stop Bismarck, but who knows...

      So my six year old son Max has an ongoing war of gags with my stepfather. He has some interesting things planned so I had to take him to  urlLink Archie McPhee  for supplies.  Then I come back, put on the racks and the   urlLink "Space Cadet"  ("Like, dude, that is sooo cool!").  Then I decide to reroute the first stop to  urlLink Polson, MT , since the campground there has wifi. It's 500 miles and roughly 8 hours. The next day is still up in the air. I can do Polson to Midland, SD (13 hours, 900 miles), where there is another wifi, but then it's 9 hours to St. Cloud and we have to be there by Sunday at a decent hour. Or I can still take Polson to Bismarck (12 hours) and then Bismarck to St Cloud is only five. Plus we'd get to go through  urlLink Fargo .  Guess we'll decide the second leg on Sarturday morning in Polson...

      I wanted to set up a blog to chronicle my biggest adiction (and latest foray into it); Cross Country Driving. We've done it five times and ready for more. This trip will begin in Seattle, WA and go through Livingston, MT, Bismarck, ND, St Cloud, MN, Windsor, ON, Carlysle, PA, Pennington, NJ, Asheville, NC, and Greenville, SC. That's just the trip out. The trip back will have to be chronicled as we go, because we'll plan it on the road. We leave July 9th, 04.  So the first thing you need is is a nice driving machine, complete with on the road accommodations. No, not an RV, an  urlLink EV .  Throw in three kids, a dog, my  urlLink traveling companion , and we're all set. Eight bucks a night at campgrounds, and a few meals at favs along the way, and our biggest expense will be gas. We drive about 500 miles or eight hours a day (whichever comes first). There are those into how fast you can get across, I'm more of the school; "if I didn't see it, I wasn't there", so I only rarely night drive.  Of course, I apparently drove through the middle of Salt Lake City, but have never been there, because I saw nothing but white until we hit the salt flats (Locals would call it an inversion, I call it an evil plot by Mormans to make everything exactly the lilywhite same).  More to come...
