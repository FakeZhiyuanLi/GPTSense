          &nbsp;Sometimes... i miss my school.    &nbsp;My school name is Ewha Woman's University. &nbsp;  &nbsp;- not women, woman's is correct name.    &nbsp;cuz as a single seed bears fruit many times its number,    &nbsp;Ewha, which began as a missionary school held   in a private home,    &nbsp;is now the world's largest women's university   with 140,000 graduates,    &nbsp;21,000 students,   14 colleges, 1division,   and 14 graduate schools.&nbsp;   &nbsp;so woman's means that ewha started only one girl. &nbsp;  &nbsp;indeed Ewha regards each students as olny one.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;This name-Ewha given from the Chson&nbsp;Dynasty's last Queen    &nbsp;about 120 years ago.                                                                                                                                               &nbsp;Anyway my school is sooooo unique.   &nbsp;very conservative and strict for school spirit.    &nbsp;first, we can not get married before graduate school.    &nbsp;if&nbsp;a student get married during school, she&nbsp;must be&nbsp;expelled from school.    &nbsp;originally Ewha&nbsp;was&nbsp;school for &nbsp;the royal and noble ladies.    &nbsp;this is a reason Ewha&nbsp;has rigid regulation.   &nbsp;(but&nbsp;that&nbsp;regulation called off by Korean Officail Feminin NGO.2 years ago.   &nbsp;but still now there are so many non-sense and out of date rule in Ewha.)  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;So almost Korean First Ladies were graduated Ewha.    &nbsp;(oh! two ex-first ladies could not graduated Ewha.    &nbsp; cuz though they went to the Ewha,   but they got married before graduate :)     &nbsp;   &nbsp;Actually i graduated only girl's school.    &nbsp;junior girl's private middle school(3 years)&nbsp;->    &nbsp;private girl's high school(3 years) ->&nbsp;women univ.(4 years)    &nbsp;WoW... it takes 10 years&nbsp;in only girls~~~&nbsp; it's crazy!    &nbsp;    &nbsp;but my father wanted&nbsp;that.and pushed me for that >.    &nbsp;because Korean olders think woman have to be&nbsp;noble&nbsp;bearing    &nbsp;and high-minded even still now.    &nbsp;they are&nbsp;regarding...    &nbsp;"private middle and high school for only girls&nbsp;"are first step for that.    &nbsp;and second step is "Ewha."    &nbsp;and then the girl must "meet good man."    &nbsp;(*that means&nbsp;he has high-class background.)     &nbsp;   &nbsp;But... !! (sorry... my father.)    &nbsp;I don't need to that, just first i regards myself.    &nbsp;because the Good Man is real man who must consider my dream and vision    &nbsp;as important as his dream and vision.   i hope to grown-up&nbsp;together.&nbsp;    &nbsp;of course, i must support him for his deam,too.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;Though i passed only girl's school for ennoble and&nbsp;courtier by parent,    &nbsp;i try to see another world.    &nbsp;and i will&nbsp;has the power to charm&nbsp;as&nbsp;not olny feminin, but HUMAN!    &nbsp;to my unknown lover and everybody:)      &nbsp;
