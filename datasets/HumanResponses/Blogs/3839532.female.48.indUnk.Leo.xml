      Here's my horoscope for the coming week from  urlLink SF Gate :  "If I knew then what I know now." What a familiar refrain! how many times have you lamented that one? This week a ghost from Leo Past past rattles chains. Is love really better the second time around? If not, maybe you'd better call in an exorcist once and for all.   It's pretty apt, although possibly out of sync with linear time, that is, it was a year ago that I reread all of Jorge's letters and the "If I knew then what I know now" was particularly poignant. But I'm basically over that now, I think. Maybe just buried, again, but this time more by reality than before. Or rather, a different view of reality. Before, it was just that there was no choice.  We'll see if I hear from him this summer. His daughter's birthday is coming up. His birthday is coming up. My birthday is coming up. I don't expect it, but, there is this horoscope...

      July 23rd seems like so long ago. On July 27th in the afternoon, Mom was going down the steps to the garage and fell, breaking her knee, specifically, the tibial plateau, right below the kneecap. They called me Tuesday night the 29th to say she was in the hospital, and I've been phoning every evening and trying to figure out what's next.  The expectation is that I'll go there for her first week or two weeks out of the hospital. Things seemed fine for the first 2 weeks, then last week she was having confused spells during the calls, but then sharpened up. I called the hospital social worker again Friday and she called me back today, as planned, to tell me what she'd found out. It seems there was an incident, maybe nothing, but urine stained her immobilizer (the brace that they use instead of a cast on her leg) and so she didn't do PT. Maybe it was the staff, maybe it was her, maybe it was nothing. But today I asked questions around the topic, not saying I'd gotten part of the story from the social worker, and she knew about it but seemed slightly oblivious.  For a while I was getting used to the idea of spending 2 weeks in the house back home ... no TV, internet only in the public library, no computer, nothing to do, but I was getting over the grimness of it. It had seemed before last week that she just might be able to be in the house there.  But I've also considered the prospect of bringing her here. After all, I'm not sure how much nursing home we can afford. Bringing her here would involve me moving. Best case: to a first floor 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment here. But I don't know if they have vacancies. Bringing her here might mean a new apartment, or more likely buying a house. But even then, I don't know how long I can care for her, especially if she's worse off than it has seemed, or if she starts a downward spiral.  But, if that's the case, maybe I won't even have to do that, and that she'll go to a nursing home after all. But then I'll still be clearing out the house and selling everything.  Oh boy. There's no way to know really what's going to happen. As horrible as it sounds, the best would be if she had a health crisis before she's discharged from the hospital.  But, the real point is that there's a chance my life will change. I don't know how, I don't even know entirely if. I do know that I cannot *move* back home. If she can't move here (and, really, there's the plane ride, including changing planes at OHare. and that's just the beginning) and spends time in a nursing home, I have no inheritance left, which was to be my retirement fund. I joke that I'll be eating cat food after I can't work anymore, but, you know, 20 years from now, 25 years from now, when I might have another 20 years to live without working, who knows.

      I'm at the end of a 2 week vacation, the first real time away I've had all fall. I did so much traveling, I actually got tired of it. A week around Labor Day (late Aug/early Sept) back home. A week in San Jose in late Sept. Another week back home in mid October. Another week at Java training in late October, though this was local, so no overnight traveling. Almost a week in Anaheim in early November.  Funny how things are so often both worse and better than expected. The situation with Mom is working out. She was in the hospital until early September, and then moved into a local assisted living facility, which is a wonderful facility and surprisingly priced. That is, you could say it's very expensive, but actually, she pays about $1700 / month for a private room with bath, all meals, a level of personal care plus the routine care and attention. I could find a nice apartment for not much less than that price. More importantly, it's a *nice* place -- clean, nicely furnished and decorated, and the people there really care.   I hadn't visited Mom at the house for a long time. I didn't really want to, but she didn't really want me to either. Now I know why. As I suspected, she was living in an unacceptable fashion -- basically, she hadn't thrown anything away for years, so there were boxes and newspapers everywhere... almost there was no place to walk. The floor around the stool is rotting. But, if I'd gone there, I would have been unable to let her live that way, but powerless to make her change. Better to have been able to live in ignorance all that time.  And, though she fell, it wasn't a serious injury, and that was the only thing that would have gotten her out of the house. We're cleaning up the house now -- that was the 2 visits back home -- and preparing for when we can get a contractor to fix the bathroom floor.  With the bathroom floor the way it is making the bathroom unusable, when I go back home I don't have to stay in the house. I have a strange relationship with that house. When I'm there, in town, I can't imagine giving the house up, and fully expect to move there, to live in that house when I retire. But, if it were possible to sleep there, I'd rather not -- too many ghosts -- and as soon as I leave town, even as soon as I get to the airport to wait for the plane, the thing that draws me into that house has dissipated.  It's been an illuminating experience, going back home. A reintegrating experience. Having been away so long, so much was unfamiliar, yet instantly familiar at the same time. Those green rolling hills. Those streets, the style of architecture, the farmland. Things that I had associated with the house, our family, I realized were "town" things, not "us" things -- the warm, old wood smell of buildings. Even the potato salad -- Mom made potato salad with a kind of salad dressing she got in the store, and I attributed that salad dressing to the flavor. Well, I bought some potato salad from the local grocery store -- locally made, but still -- and it tasted just like Mom's.   I don't think Mom has Alzheimer's per se, but she does have mental confusion on a relatively regular basis. I attributed this confusion as a factor in a variety of things, particularly the poor (you might say) decisions regarding how she lived in the house. But, being a pack rat is not new. My second trip, the task was to clean out the old canned, boxed, jarred food and other "junk" -- I call this the second layer: layer one was the boxes, newspapers, and magazines, which were the first trip. Layer three will be the next trip: things not worth keeping but not worthy of being taken to the dump either -- destined for the consignment store or donating for the tax benefit.  Anyway, I found that keeping everything is not anywhere new. I think the most astounding to me was the empty medicine bottles, my grandmother's prescription, from 1973. Second, or maybe equal, was the clean and neatly folded paper labels from canned goods. My thought: I was raised by a crazy woman, who was antisocial, untrained in affection. I've since learned she was put up for adoption because her birth mother was "mentally unstable", who lived the last years of her life in a mental hospital, and died there in a fire. Mom herself was adopted by probably the worst choice of mother. Then my father died, there was that year in Alaska, and then into the life at my grandmother's house -- no wonder I'm as socially inept as I am, but a wonder I've been as successful an adult as I have been. At least it ends here, with this generation. Thank God I don't have a child to pass all this on to. Actually, literally, because, like so many things, I believe it was the hand of Fate (or God, or whatever you want to call it) that fixed up circumstances to lead me away from deadly paths.  Oh, California was weird! Especially San Jose. I swear, the place was out of the Sims. That is, in the game, there are these weird things: chairs, etc., and architectural and landscaping elements that I've just thought were weird -- like, who would have that stuff in their house? Well, "who" would be people who live in Silicon Valley. Yeesh.  But the past two months have been really draining. I knew it was -- I saw the signs, but there wasn't anything to do but wait for the holidays.

      I don't mind getting old. I'm even enjoying it. But this is what's depressing: the good men are not my age anymore.        Joan Sebastián is 4 years older than me.         Whereas Marco Antonio Solís is 3 years younger than me.     I suppose it's unfair to make the comparison. I mean, Marco Antonio Solís is fucking gorgeous. But still.

      I had a dream last night. Bryan (my ex) was there, and we were in a house. He had said something about having to wait to see if the rocket moved, but I didn't know what he meant. Then later there was some kind of notification he got, and I asked what was wrong and he said the rocket had moved. He looked outside and there was someone there, caught in something and struggling. We went down but we couldn't help, and there was some kind of explosion, but all we could have from him was his lower jaw. Then we went back inside and Bryan was very agitated getting ready for whatever it was. Then I saw some kind of map and called for him to come over. The map was a map showing an area of outer space with some planetary bodies marked, and the map also showed a shaded area that began in one spot and was spreading across the map, coming toward our location. Bryan was very agitated. He'd been destroying things in the house, chopping them up with a knife. When he saw the map he calmed down a little and seemed to focus. He was still destroying things, but it was more like sanitizing or immunizing things in the house, getting ready for whatever was coming.  Such strange imagery. I haven't seen this kind of imagery in a dream before. There was a part of the dream that I'd seen in a dream before though. In one part, before the above, it was still with Bryan I think, or someone anyway, some guy. We were supposed to meet for breakfast and I was walking there through a building, like a large hotel or a mall which I'd been at before on two occasions. I got lost trying to find my way to the place where they served breakfast, even though I recognized the place. I remembered that I had gotten lost there before. I never found the place where they served breakfast, but I saw Bryan (or whoever it was) finally and exclaimed how I'd been at this venue for 2 other conferences or events and that each time I got lost.

      On one hand, I still occasionally get carded when buying beer in the Seven-Eleven. Strangers who meet me generally put me somewhere in my 30s. Yet, in about a month, I'll have my 48th birthday.  I have a growing awareness that I'm approaching what might be called old -- some would say I am already old. In fact, I do feel my years. I'm not talking about physically in this case, but rather the awareness of the years of experiences I've had.  What's weird now is me in relation to the people around me. Specifically, I find myself looking at guys and finding them attractive, but then I realize they're young -- 25, 30, something like that -- and what I'm doing is displacing myself as a younger person.  But what's also weird is seeing public figures, men that is -- me being in that solitary state this blog is named for -- and assuming they're older than me, only to find out that even they are at least a few years younger. Now *that* makes me feel old.

      Referring to  urlLink my previous post  ... "In classical physics, [Deutch] says, there is no such thing as 'if'; the future is determined absolutely by the past." And this is still true in a multiverse model, as long as the individual universes remain independent of one another.  Adding humans into the model: as long as the humans within an individual universe remain able to only perceive the single universe they are in, this determinism also remains true. Under the presupposition of humans experiencing only the universe they inhabit, information transfer and flow remains within the closed system of the individual universe. Things happen (information flow/transfer is initiated), other things happen as a result (information is received), and still other things happen from that (information is retransmitted). Humans have generally instantiated this in the form of "linear time" and "cause and effect".  Keep in mind that these "events" or "things happening" are also instantiations, not the "real thing" -- the events and things happening are given form by humans who perceive them and then give them names, define them, and get enough other humans to agree with the instantiation so that the social weight of the group instantiation makes the humans believe it to be real. -- Thus, for example, things that are seen in hallucinations are not "real" because they are a perception that only one human shares, while the color blue is "real" because when you point to a color and call it blue, most everyone will agree with you and even those who don't agree are disagreeing on the details of the definition, not the fact that a definition of "blue" exists. The world as a flat object used to be real until enough humans shared a different perception of the Earth.  Continuing with the article I cited in my previous post: "In the multiverse, however, there are alternatives; the quantum possibilities really happen"  We can see this  urlLink scientifically  (scroll to the bottom to the section "Interfering with the multiverse) You can see the shadow of other universes using little more than a light source and two metal plates. This is the famous double-slit experiment, the touchstone of quantum weirdness.  Particles from the atomic realm such as photons, electrons or atoms are fired at the first plate, which has two vertical slits in it. The particles that go through hit the second plate on the far side.  Imagine the places that are hit show up black and that the places that are not hit show up white. After the experiment has been running for a while, and many particles have passed through the slits, the plate will be covered in vertical stripes alternating black and white. That is an interference pattern.  To make it, particles that passed through one slit have to interfere with particles that passed through the other slit. The pattern simply does not form if you shut one slit.  The strange thing is that the interference pattern forms even if particles come one at a time, with long periods in between. So what is affecting these single particles?  According to the many worlds interpretation, each particle interferes with another particle going through the other slit. What other particle? "Another particle in a neighbouring universe," says David Deutsch. He believes this is a case where two universes split apart briefly, within the experiment, then come back together again. "In my opinion, the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment. It reveals interference between neighbouring universes, the root of all quantum phenomena." But we can also see things in everyday life that should make us stop and consider how we should understand them: as a previously unrecognized part of the individual universe we live in, or as a glimpse of a different universe. A third option might be that it's something imaginary, but that is an option that shouldn't be chosen lightly -- it's easy to use that as a catch-all category for anything that we haven't been able to understand enough to believe in -- but we need to also realize that the fact that something was imagined by someone might be enough to make it a real part of the multiverse.  And continuing from my previous post again: "'By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives,' [Deutsch] says. 'When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen.'"  I'm not sure I agree with this view of the interaction between universes, apart from the idea that spreading good is beneficial and the good you spread in your universe can seep into other universes when the universes brush up against one another.  My view at the moment is that awareness of the multiverse does other things for us here in our individual universe. For one thing, it's a useful explanation for those moments of deja vu and synchronicity that are otherwise inexplicable. It also can help us keep things in perspective: there really is only today to live in because everything else is just an echo of today. And whatever we think of our current universe, there are countless others that are both better and worse.  Also consider the question of mental illness or other memory or reality disorders... We should think of treatment as nothing more than methods for helping the person deal with the universe he physically shares with the rest of us, rather than an attempt to cure the person of whatever we think he has.  The concept of many universes also applies to spirituality and religion -- in what we call mystical, pagan, or shamanistic practices, the goal is to reach into the other universes while keeping a tie with the current one. The break from those, notably with the Judeo-Christian-Muslim practices, the goal is to close off the other universes and maintain control and clarity of perception within the current universe.

      I should have read on in  urlLink the article  before writing:  Deutsch found that, almost all the time, information flows only within small pieces of the quantum calculation, and not in between those pieces. These pieces, he says, are separate universes. They feel separate and autonomous because all the information we receive through our senses has come from within one universe. As Oxford philosopher Michael Lockwood put it, "We cannot look sideways, through the multiverse, any more than we can look into the future."   Sometimes universes in Deutsch's model peel apart only locally and fleetingly, and then slap back together again. This is the cause of quantum interference, which is at the root of everything from the two-slit experiment to the basic structure of atoms.   More from the New Scientist article:  "One day, a quantum computer will be built which does more simultaneous calculations than there are particles in the Universe," says Deutsch. "Since the Universe as we see it lacks the computational resources to do the calculations, where are they being done?" It can only be in other universes, he says. "Quantum computers share information with huge numbers of versions of themselves throughout the multiverse."   Imagine that you have a quantum PC and you set it a problem. What happens is that a huge number of versions of your PC split off from this Universe into their own separate, local universes, and work on parallel strands of the problem. A split second later, the pocket universes recombine into one, and those strands are pulled together to provide the answer that pops up on your screen. "Quantum computers are the first machines humans have ever built to exploit the multiverse directly," says Deutsch.   And:  What would it mean for you and me to know there are inconceivably many yous and mes living out all possible histories? Surely, there is no point in making any choices for the better if all possible outcomes happen? We might as well stay in bed or commit suicide.   Deutsch does not agree. In fact, he thinks it could make real choice possible. In classical physics, he says, there is no such thing as "if"; the future is determined absolutely by the past. So there can be no free will. In the multiverse, however, there are alternatives; the quantum possibilities really happen. Free will might have a sensible definition, Deutsch thinks, because the alternatives don't have to occur within equally large slices of the multiverse. "By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives," he says. "When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen."   David Deutsch's article "The structure of the multiverse" is  urlLink here

      On the topic of the reality of objects in a quantum universe and the role of observation in reality:   Deutsch dismisses them all. "Some are gibberish, like the Copenhagen interpretation," he says-and the rest are just variations on the many worlds theme.  For example, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, the act of observing is crucial. Observation forces an atom to make up its mind, and plump for being in only one place out of all the possible places it could be. But the Copenhagen interpretation is itself open to interpretation. What constitutes an observation? For some people, this only requires a large-scale object such as a particle detector. For others it means an interaction with some kind of conscious being.  Worse still, says Deutsch, is that in this type of interpretation you have to abandon the idea of reality. Before observation, the atom doesn't have a real position. To Deutsch, the whole thing is mysticism-throwing up our hands and saying there are some things we are not allowed to ask. Except, Deutsch is slightly off too. He should talk to the cognitive scientists who work in psychology, philosophy, and linguistics.   It's not that observation forces an atom to make up its mind and place itself in one place of all possible places. It's that humans are only capable of experiencing one universe at a time, and so when they manage to observe an atom, what they observe is the atom in the particular universe that the humans have succeeded in tuning in to. In that particular universe, the atom is precisely where it's supposed to be and in the only place it can be.&nbsp; (there's nowhere you can be that isn't where you were meant to be, it's easy...)   It doesn't matter if it's a particle detector or a conscious being that makes the observation, because, in the end, it's still a human that perceives that an observation has taken place. That perception, and, by extension, observation, is all about the human -- the interplay of our physically-based senses, our physically-based mental interpretations of our senses, and our experientially-based mental interpretations of our senses. Those three things are required for perception and observation to take place, and those three things, in turn, determine the outcome of the act of perception and observation -- that is, our decision regarding what it is that we perceived and observed and what that thing we perceived means.

      Interesting article on a variant of  urlLink multiverse theory  -- that  urlLink we all live in a computer simulation &nbsp;(we all live in a Yellow Submarine...).   The newspaper article gets part of it a little screwy:   Travel a trillion light years beyond the Andromeda galaxy, and you might find yourself in a universe where gravity is a bit stronger or electrons a bit heavier.  The vast majority of these other universes will not have the necessary fine-tuned coincidences needed for life to emerge; they are sterile and so go unseen. Only in Goldilocks universes like ours where things have fallen out just right, purely by accident, will sentient beings arise to be amazed at how ingeniously bio-friendly their universe is.  It's not that you "travel a trillion light years" or that the other universes lack what is needed for life. Both of those concepts are rooted in the metaphors that are inherent in the universe we inhabit and are thus, by definition, irrelevant to the other universes.   Even the computer simulation part is just another, this time more modern, metaphor. If it works as a metaphor, it's just because the people who thought up the metaphor have been able to lift the veil, so to speak.

      My mom has Alzheimer's. Well, that's not a complete statement. My mom has been diagnosed as having Alzheimer's with Lewy Bodies. But even&nbsp;that may not be exactly right. Precisely, she has been having off-and-on periods of confusion and lucidity for a while, and recently she's started having hallucinations. Because of that, the doctor diagnosed her as having Alzheimer's with Lewy Bodies, however the CAT scan that's required to identify deposits in the brain that are associated with Lewy Bodies disease weren't done, and I agree that it's beside the point. With the word "Alzheimer" in the diagnosis, she can be moved to the Alzheimer's unit of the assisted living facility she's in. By moving there, she can get a level of care with greater attention from the staff and also she won't be bothering the other women who live there when she talks about seeing bugs in her dinner.   I'm so sad that this is happening to her. Her nurse says she's content, but I still feel so alone and helpless. It really doesn't matter that I'm living far away -- whether I was living there or not, I'd still be helpless to do anything.

      I think I know why guys sniff around after other women. Well, I take that partially back. I suppose there are a variety of reasons. But one other has occurred to me.  New hormones.  It's nice having a new set of hormones or pheromones or whatever around. In my case, the hormone involved would be new testosterone. New estrogen is also noticable if it's a woman who's interesting and nice, but it's not the same as new testosterone. (which, I guess, indicates that I'm not a lesbian)  New testosterone, even when it's a guy I'd never think of in "that" way, is energizing and invigorating.  And then, when the new testosterone is accompanied by a nice guy who looks at least reasonably good and who even flirts some, it's fantastic.  If this at all goes on with guys (whether they're aware of it or not) I can understand why they'd go sniffing after new women to hang out and flirt with. Not because they want anything (though, who turns down a viable offer), and it has nothing to do with relationships in the Capital R sense. It's just the energy you get in the presence of some really good hormones.  So after a few days of my fresh set of hormones, I downloaded my 2 free movies that came with my DSL account. One was Timeline. I didn't expect much because I'd seen the reviews, but the book was good, and even bad medieval is usually passable in one way or another. And that's about what it was.  Then I watched the second one --  urlLink Something's Gotta Give . Wow. A perfect movie to follow my few days of new hormones.  At nearly 48, I'm younger than the characters, but I have reached the age where I'm beginning to understand. People have written that Keanu Reeves' character is shallow and one-dimensional. But he's not really. In fact, at first, he's gorgeous, and you're incredulous that Diane Keaton's character would even consider Jack Nicholson over him. But then after she finds the real "Jack", Keanu is just a kid in comparison. It's not that he's one-dimensional or a plot device, it's that his character is young, and we have come to see him through Diane's eyes. It's not one-dimensionality, it's the complexity that comes with several decades of living that is missing.  Of course it's just a movie, and not real life, but it's still nice to see a movie that inspires you to think that it really isn't too late. And that's exactly what I've been thinking about myself. Not that someone is on the horizon, but my few days of new hormones has encouraged me to think that I should stop thinking nothing, or no one, ever will be again.

      In fall of 2003 I checked out 2 books on Bolivia from the library. One is "Gender and Modernity in Andean Bolivia" by Marcia Stephenson. Well, my last renewal is almost up, so I decided I should finally look at these books to see if I still want to read them.  One, which I'd started, is no longer of interest and was barely of interest before, so I picked up the other, "Gender and Modernity". I noticed the author's name, and it rang a bell. Then reading through her acknowledgements, I thought I recognized a couple of names, and then saw a third I was sure I recognized. But, of all the contacts she mentions, including those in La Paz, she never mentioned Jorge.  Anyway, her university affiliation was mentioned and I had to get up to see what I could find. Her photo is on her faculty home page, and it's the person I thought it was. She and her friend Joy were both good friends of Jorge's when he was in the States; they were among the crowd of Spanish dept/South American/US Latino/Anglos-with-Latino-ties people who I knew through him. By chance I found her book. Although she wouldn't independently remember me, I'm sure she'd remember with some prompting.  It's curious to me though that she doesn't mention him. She spends a whole chapter talking about Siglo XX, albeit in the context of Domitila Barrios de Chungara. Was that time just so far removed that she didn't try to, or think to, contact him? Or was he impossible to find? Or just no particular help? Or is he really just gone -- something I wondered when I wrote to him in 2002 and got no replies.  ----  I shouldn't be surprised at the connections though. There's a professor in the Spanish department here who was a grad student where we were, although after us. However, he is or was a good friend of someone who was a very good friend of Jorge's.

      While  urlLink the story  of how I started listening to Mexican music is true, it's not correct to imply that it was totally serendipitous.  In summer of 2002 I thought I would try to go to a conference in 2004 that would be held in Buenos Aires (though this trip is not to be). And, I thought, if I was going to be going all the way to Buenos Aires, I should stop and visit La Paz, Bolivia on the way back. And improving my Spanish was something I should do if I was going to do that.  Another contributing event was in fall 2002. I had a run-in with an overly protective web master over a discography and lyrics site I'd made for Los Kjarkas that left a very bad taste in my mouth, even to the extent of not being able to listen to their music for a long time. Even today I avoid listening. (thanks Laila. you really know how to support your group and cultivate fans.)  I'd been bemoaning the fact that it was things-Bolivia that was my interest and experience and my only access was newpapers and message boards online. Despite living in Texas, in DFW, in the midst of a whole Latino culture outside my door.  And I had it on a good authority that in many ways, Bolivia and Mexico are very similar, including the style of speaking Spanish. Even I heard it expressed that Mexico shared more with Bolivia than other Andean countries (other than the obvious).  It all goes back to Jorge, you know. Even when we had so many problems. Even when I finally quit and told him we had to stop talking because it was impossible for us to be together. It still all goes back to him.  If I'm alone now, it's also because of him. After him, I chose somebody who was totally wrong. The opposite of him, in some ways. And when that ended, finally, and I got myself back ... now I'm too old. Set in my ways. Not interested in changing or compromising. And any men that are left are married or irreparably damaged.  But I'm still influenced. I've finally noticed that Marco Antonio Sol&iacute;s bears resemblance to Jorge. That is, now I can see why I got captivated, why he's different from the other famous, pretty, romantic singers. There's a quality and also sort of a style that goes back to Jorge.  Well, persona anyway. I'm not saying the person of Marco Antonio Sol&iacute;s is any particular way. Even physically -- check the photos carefully and you can find signs of the airbrush. And he's well packaged. The videos well produced. One album in particular, "Trozos de mi Alma", is crafted in a most effective way. By track 5 I'm in tears, predictably. It's the lyrics, the tunes, but also the production. As much the production that manipulates that emotionality as anything. The people putting him together know how to get the women fans to swoon.  But, you know, it really doesn't matter. It might be illusion. It might be fantasy. But those form their own realities, and in fact, the illusion and fantasy are the point.  And, I suppose, precisely the point for someone like me ... solita ... intent on being alone and creating my world in my mind. The fact that I only think and, now, occasionally write (in a non-public blog that no one else reads) -- does that make it any different from creating worlds that others share? I've heard a performer say that the difference between performance and masturbation is the audience. I'm not sure I agree.  ----  But, you know, it's just as well that it didn't turn out that I would go to that conference. It's just as well I didn't try to visit La Paz. That's mixing illusion and reality with the past, which is a dangerous thing, something to be undertaken only with care.  Alternatively, though, ... maybe a  urlLink 2 week Spanish course  in Michoac&aacute;n?

      Tickets for Marco Antonio Sol&iacute;s (and that other guy) went on sale yesterday, I found out today from a Ticketmaster e-mail. American Airlines Center in Dallas, which is a bigger venue than NextStage. I knew the concert was for Sunday, August 15th, but I assumed evening. It's at 3:00 pm, and apparently there is a rodeo before the concert -- hmm, maybe they mean the day before. Anyway, there are no floor seats. I'm in the first lower section to the right of the stage, row F, seat 15. The best available (according to Ticketmaster) at the time. Side view, but at least it's closer. Maybe I should shop for pocket binoculars.  The ticket was $100 but who cares. Finally I can afford to do things like this and pay $100 plus $20 for parking to go to a concert. Well, not afford it every day, but still.

      Yesterday I was dissing Joan Sebasti&aacute;n, and then tonight I find out that this song I've liked ever since I first heard it on the radio is by him. "Secreto de Amor". And to think that when I heard it on the radio, I assumed that it was one of those young pretty boys who have more to do with the Caribbean than Mexico.  So there you go. Don't go making assumptions.

      I never meant to get into Mexican music. It started in November 2002. I kept sleeping through the alarm in the morning and I needed to find something that would wake me up. So, I decided that if horns and accordians blaring at top volume didn't do it, nothing would. With that, I tuned the radio to 94.1 in Dallas. It woke me up.  But then after not too long I got the urge to tune the car radio to that station on the way to work. Within a week, from having the station on in the car for 20 minutes twice a day, I was already recognizing songs.  Then, my Spanish started getting a little better, and I started understanding a few songs. Or, at least, understanding enough so that, for the songs I liked, I could search for the lyrics on the web.  The first songs this happened with were "Ay Papacito" by Grupo Limite and "El Dolor de tu Presencia" by Jennifer Pe&ntilde;a. Then "Amor de Internet" by Socios de Ritmo. And "Comer a Besos" by Los Temerarios -- this one's still at the top of my favorite song list.  Another favorite that I've recently found is by Alicia Villareal, who is the singer in Limite, "Te Quedo Grande la Yegua". But this is from the new phase. In May or maybe late April I discovered that Comcast had added a video channel, Video Rola, which is nothing but Mexican music.  Anyway, I'm totally into Mexican music now.  Marco Antonio Sol&iacute;s and Joan Sebasti&aacuten are supposed to be doing a concert in Dallas August 15th, and I'm planning to go. I hope it's at NextStage in Grand Prairie. I hope I can get a seat in the center only a few rows from the front. I hope I don't feel weird being a single Anglo female in a Latino audience of couple and groups.
