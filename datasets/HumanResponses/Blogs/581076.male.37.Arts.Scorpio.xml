      A Clean Evolution by Annaleigh Watts  I have not scrubbed in days I have not scrubbed in weeks Presenting a challenge You only think you can face  Comb my hair for me, Yes it's true I'm such a mess But dear, cannot you realize these are signs of deep distress  A wretched scream Look, I'm so busy with these screams I've no time  for exfoliation  If cleanliness  is next to Godliness then I am far so far away I die every day to see my face  shine into  the sun.

      talked to Carolyn today about using her photography, which is very good, and she will talk to two of her friends who may send me some poetry.  Thought of a couple of names for paper version of this zine:  Lithium Carbonate, In the Flat Fields.  Or just The Flat Fields.  Less pretentious, less Bauhaus.  I think I'll do a poll on LJ.

      well, blogger updated their templates.  to embed or not to embed?  it's all about time, and how much of it i have.  you'd think being unemployed would make it easier. i guess this, obviously, is the blog for lithium, not lithium itself.  lithium must go on!

      wow, blogger looks different.  must be the google in it.  anyway, I am going to put lithium onto my own web site, www.chayumi.com, although I think blogger does show up in searches better.  to submit work or ask questions, email lithium@chayumi.com.  thanks!

      saw mel wong memorial last night.  amazing.  words, images, dance, emotion.  hanging out with cousins and their friends today, dancers, composers.  hanging out with my sister, who is much more of an introvert than me, i think.  talked to jen, still have not seen kill bill, want to, amazing breakfast of swedish pancakes this morning with creme fresh, nutella, blueberries, raspberries.    one warehouse place called me back.  sounds like a possibility.  a chance to literally design and build my own studio/living space.  with most if not all of the materials paid for.  we'll see.

      jen has started reading the hours.  i have read mrs dalloway, some of woolf's letters.  interesting i suppose.  that was a while ago, i may feel differently now.  i tried to read the waves and to the lighthouse.  "what a lark, what a plunge!" i think is how dalloway starts.    hangin on craigslist.  looking for a job etc.  seein what's out there.  i need to brush my teeth, i should meditate, esp. considering this travel thing.  but jen will take me to santa cruz if i miss merida.  jen is awesome.  so my sister called.  we'll meet her at san jose and have plenty of time for dinner before the service.  good deal.  life marches on.

      feel like i've finished my novel.  cut it in half, down to 300 pp. which means i have 300 pp of raw shit to go into my next novel/project.  non-fiction appeals to me more.  but hey.  oops i almost wrote heh.  no!!!!

      jen is getting ready to read the  corrections with her cereal.  i am learning the blogger world.  a lot of people on drugs, apparently.  i thought that wasn't cool anymore?  what is this, friendster?  maybe people on drugs tend towards aimless net times.

      ok so i am ready to go now, more than ever.  I've been using livejournal almost well totally exclusively for several years now but due to demographics etc I am looking to use blogger more.  so we'll see how it goes.  hoping for a call from my sister today, she is flying into san jose so that we can attend a memorial service in santa cruz, but she apparently had trouble calling me? so I had to call her husband for her schedule.  hopefully it will work out.    painting with jen today, i think.  i am ready for coffee now.  saw daredevil last night.  can this be like my morning page sometimes?  or do i need more freedom with that?

      it's getting warm in here. it's very late/early in the morning.   idea for painting: use image of red tv that matt created, if it is cool with him, in a series of paintings, for example just a red tv, then a red tv with the heart, for the contest, then a photo of tv along with painting of it, and an abstraction, as well as other abstractions. i also like photo/printout of mixed media drawing/painting/piece with heart and words.   heart in tv: we are attached to our tvs like we are to lovers sometimes. either as low-brow sitcoms or high-brow foreign films on dvd, we can be heartbroken without our window on the world and on the hearts of others. my experiences as a child, learning about love, american style, from the love boat and other shows. this would mainly determine how my heart would be broken later in life when fantasy island met the reality of girls and dating.

      I'm taking link to Blue off the site because The Art of Fasting is really a revision of Blue.  Blue will still be on Amazon for a while until I can figure out how to get it off, get my other stuff on.  I'm excited about having my blogs here set up for ftp.  I will probably add grapics at some point.  I could put one here, just for fun. from the ezine of the same name, stirring:   I really like this photo.

      Ok, so chayumi.com grows, evolves.  It's now Chayumi Design, to encompass the Web Design pages and other stuff. Focus has shifted, backed away. I'm looking for an audience, although the site is not as tight as it could be, so I am focused on getting all links down before mass marketing.  Flash, maybe.  CWD has flash of course. That I don't promote, just need to set up a html option page. And a link.  I like how everything ties together.  Pretty soon I'll need an assistant. Maybe Rob, Willis, someone else who wants to learn web design.

      i am constantly changing things on my site lately, trying to figure out what I am doing.  such a list of things to do, publish stuff, get images, contact people, promote, market, ask for money, enter contests, etc. prioritize.  this blog seems as likely to be personal as well as related to other projects. it's all related, with a certain degree of privacy i suppose.  at least more potential of being read than my livejournal blog which is getting old.  tribe seems to be of more value.    talk to sarah about putting her chapbook under mayumi press.  it might be a good idea.    redeem: as in the Four Quartets, time as redeemable...to rescue or save from sin.   I have read that poem probably more than any other.
