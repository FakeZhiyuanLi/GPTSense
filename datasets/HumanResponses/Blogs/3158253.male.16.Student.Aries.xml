        Swallows may have gone, but there is a time of return; willow trees may have died back, but there is a time of regreening; peach blossoms may have fallen, but they will bloom again. Now you the wise, tell me, why should our days leave us, never to return? -If someone had stolen them, who could it be? Where could he hide them? If they had made the escape themselves, then where could they stay at the moment? I don't know how many days I have been given to spend, but I do feel my hands are getting empty. Taking stock silently find that more than eight thousand days have already slid away from me. Like a drop of water from the point of a needle disappearing into the ocean, my days are dripping into the steam of time, soundless, traceless. Already sweat is starting on my forehead, and tears welling up in my eyes. Those that have gone have gone for good, those to come keep coming; yet in between, how swift is the shift, in such a rush? When I get up in the morning, the slanting sun marks its presents in my small room two or three oblongs. The sun has feet, look, he is treading on, lightly and furtively; and I am caught, blankly, in his revolution. Thus-the days flows away through the sink when I wash my hands, wears off in the bowl when I eat my meal, and passes away before my day-dreaming gaze as reflect in silence. I can feel his haste now, so I reach out my hands to hold him back, but he keeps flowing past my withholding hands. In the evening, as I lie in bed, he strides over my body, glides past my feet, in his agile way. The moment I open my eyes and meet the sun again, one while day has gone. I bury my face in my hands and heave a sigh. But the new day begins to flash past in the sigh. What can I do, in this bustling world, with the days flying in their escape? Nothing but to hesitate, to rush. What have I been doing in that eight-thousand-day rush, apart from hesitating? Those bygone days have been dispersed as smoke by a light wind, or evaporated as mist by the morning sun. What traces have I left behind me? Have I ever left behind any gossamer traces at all? I have come to the world, stark naked; am I to go back, in a blink, in the same stark nakedness? It is not fair though: why should I have made such a trip for nothing! You the wise, tell me, why should our days leave us, never to return? March 28th, 1922

              Can it really be sixty-two years ago that I first saw you?  It is truly a lifetime, I know. But as I gaze into your eyes now, it seems like only yesterday that I first saw you, in that small cafe in Hanover Square.  From the moment I saw you smile, as you opened the door for that young mother and her newborn baby. I knew. I knew that I wanted to share the rest of my life with you.   I still think of how foolish I must have looked, as I gazed at you, that first time. I remember watching you intently, as you took off your hat and loosely shook your short dark hair with your fingers. I felt myself becoming immersed in your every detail, as you placed your hat on the table and cupped your hands around the hot cup of tea, gently blowing the steam away with your pouted lips.  From that moment, everything seemed to make perfect sense to me. The people in the cafe and the busy street outside all disappeared into a hazy blur. All I could see was you.  All through my life I have relived that very first day. Many, many times I have sat and thought about that the first day, and how for a few fleeting moments I am there, feeling again what is like to know true love for the very first time. It pleases me that I can still have those feelings now after all those years, and I know I will always have them to comfort me.  Not even as I shook and trembled uncontrollably in the trenches, did I forget your face. I would sit huddled into the wet mud, terrified, as the hails of bullets and mortars crashed down around me. I would clutch my rifle tightly to my heart, and think again of that very first day we met. I would cry out in fear, as the noise of war beat down around me. But, as I thought of you and saw you smiling back at me, everything around me would be become silent, and I would be with you again for a few precious moments, far from the death and destruction. It would not be until I opened my eyes once again, that I would see and hear the carnage of the war around me.  I cannot tell you how strong my love for you was back then, when I returned to you on leave in the September, feeling battered, bruised and fragile. We held each other so tight I thought we would burst. I asked you to marry me the very same day and I whooped with joy when you looked deep into my eyes and said "yes" to being my bride.  I'm looking at our wedding photo now, the one on our dressing table, next to your jewellery box. I think of how young and innocent we were back then. I remember being on the church steps grinning like a Cheshire cat, when you said how dashing and handsome I looked in my uniform. The photo is old and faded now, but when I look at it, I only see the bright vibrant colors of our youth. I can still remember every detail of the pretty wedding dress your mother made for you, with its fine delicate lace and pretty pearls. If I concentrate hard enough, I can smell the sweetness of your wedding bouquet as you held it so proudly for everyone to see.  I remember being so over enjoyed, when a year later, you gently held my hand to your waist and whispered in my ear that we were going to be a family.  I know both our children love you dearly; they are outside the door now, waiting.  Do you remember how I panicked like a mad man when Jonathon was born? I can still picture you laughing and smiling at me now, as I clumsily held him for the very first time in my arms. I watched as your laughter faded into tears, as I stared at him and cried my own tears of joy.  Sarah and Tom arrived this morning with little Tessie. Can you remember how we both hugged each other tightly when we saw our tiny granddaughter for the first time? I can't believe she will be eight next month. I am trying not to cry, my love, as I tell you how beautiful she looks today in her pretty dress and red shiny shoes, she reminds me so much of you that first day we met. She has her hair cut short now, just like yours was all those years ago. When I met her at the door her smile wrapped around me like a warm glove, just like yours used to do, my darling.   I know you are tired, my dear, and I must let you go. But I love you so much it hurts to do so.  As we grew old together, I would tease you that you had not changed since we first met. But it is true, my darling. I do not see the wrinkles and grey hair that other people see. When I look at you now, I only see your sweet tender lips and youthful sparkling eyes as we sat and had out first picnic next to that small stream, and chased each other around that big old oak tree. I remember wishing those first few days together would last forever. Do you remember how exciting and wonderful those days were?  I must go now, my darling. Our children are waiting outside. They want to say goodbye to you.  I wipe the tears away from my eyes and bend my frail old legs down to the floor, so that I can kneel beside you. I lean close to you and take hold of your hand and kiss your tender lips for the very last time.  Sleep peacefully my dear.  I am sad that you had to leave me, but please don't worry. I am content, knowing I will be with you soon. I am too old and too empty now to live much longer without you.  I know it won't be long before we meet again in that small cafe in Hanover Square.   Goodbye, my darling wife.     i am really moved

          I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with you.                      The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them.        No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry.           Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.           To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.           Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you.           Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.         Don't try so hard; the best things come when you least expect them to.           Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.          Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.

             If I were a boy again, I would practice perseverance more often, and never give up a thing because it was hard or inconvenient.  If we want light, we must conquer darkness. Perseverance can sometimes equal genius in its results. "There are only two creatures," says a proverb, "who can surmount the pyramids-the eagle and the snail."   If I were a boy again, I would school myself into a habit of attention;  I would let nothing come between the subject and me in hand.  I would remember that a good skater never tries to skate in two directions at once.  The habit of attention becomes part of our life, if we begin early enough.  I often hear grown up people say, "I could not fix my attention on the sermon or book, although I wished to do so", and the reason is, the habit was not formed in youth.  If I were to live my life over again, I would pay more attention to the cultivation of the memory.  I would strengthen that faculty by every possible means, and on every possible occasion.  It takes a little hard work at first to remember things accurately;  But memory soon helps itself, and gives very little trouble.  It only needs early cultivation to become a power.   If I were a boy again, I would cultivate courage.  "Nothing is so mild and gentle as courage, nothing so cruel and pitiless as cowardice," says a wise author.  We too often borrow trouble, and anticipate that may never appear.  "The fear of ill exceeds the ill we fear."  Dangers will arise in any career, but presence of mind will often conquer the worst of them.  Be prepared for any fate, and there is no harm to be feared.  If I were a boy again, I would look on the cheerful side.  Life is very much like a mirror: if you smile upon it, it smiles back upon you; but if you frown and look doubtful on it, you will get a similar look in return. Inner sunshine warms not only the heart of the owner, but of all that come in contact with it.  "Who shuts love out, in turn shall be shut out from love."   If I were a boy again, I would school myself to say no more often.  I might write pages on the importance of learning very early in life to gain that point where a young boy can stand erect, and decline doing an unworthy act because it is unworthy.   If I were a boy again, I would demand of myself more courtesy towards my companions and friends, and indeed towards strangers as well.  The smallest courtesies along the rough roads of life are like the little birds that sing to us all winter long, and make that season of ice and snow more endurable.   Finally, instead of trying hard to be happy, as if that were the sole purpose of life, I would, if I were a boy again, I would still try harder to make others happy.

       There are gains for all our losses. There are balms for all our pain:  But when youth, the dream, departs. It takes something from our hearts,  And it never comes again.  We are stronger, and are better,  Under manhood's sterner reign:  Still we feel that something sweet Following youth, with flying feet,  And will never come again.  Something beautiful is vanished, And we sigh for it in vain;  We behold it everywhere, on the earth, and in the air,  But it never comes again!      `

           this is what i translated for my friends for a forum           Manifesto of Maxchina. Fellow-citizens of Maxchina, please listen to me. Maxchina is our regular online habitat. That is, Maxchina is our virtual home! As we all knew this, why didn't we jump at the opportunity? As we all knew this, why didn't we retain our own home? Four vanguards of Maxchina are Tiantian, dicky, Sonic and Carmen. They are just students that have common interest and hope. They have already fulfilled their first step to found Maxchina Group in a very difficult situation. Hard working made today. And I feel honored to be a member of it. However, this situation isn't what we ever expected. Maxchina was set up almost half year ago. But now, we only have about 200 registered members. What is worse, they are always NOT online! Is this what we ever expected? No! Of course not! What does MAX mean? It means MAXIMUM!!!largest, best ever! But, why can we hold on to this? As china is so large, aren't there any people wanting to build our net community, our another homeland together with us? As we can see, our systems aren't completed and not good enough. We must improve, which is what we are trying our best to do at the very moment. But how can we expand only with our little strength? How can we make Maxchina larger and larger with such few people? I have ever been to some other forums. Each of them has its strong point. But they have one in common. That is, the number of their registered members is far larger than that of us. Why? What's the reason? Do we do worse than them? Didn't we try our best? NO! So what is we lack of? Advertising! What do we need? Registered members!   www.maxchina.cn  What a simple domain name! This is what we decided after several discussions. The reason is that this domain name is easier to remember and easier for us to disseminate. Now there are many similar forums challenging us. How can we challenge others with this situation and attitude? We have our own strong points and merit. We have space and free to all sayings and words. Registered members can send off applications for their own space of a whole page. All we need are advertising and registered members, with which we can make Maxchina grow up and build up our home. Wake up! Wake up sleeping fellow-citizens! We'll never allow the good days to slide away from us. We'll never allow our homeland to be brushed aside. Friends of Maxchina, wake up! Cheer up! Only if we together determine to do it, we'll make it. The motivity of Maxchina won't exhaust. Maxchina will become more and more powerful. Maybe one day Maxchina will vanish from network because of no motivity due to the lack of registered members. But it's not today! Maybe one day Maxchina will become the trash of network because of being brushed aside due to not enough advertisement. But it's not today! Maybe one day Maxchina will become a place with good and evil people mixed up leading to close down because of not good enough management systems. But it's not today! Maybe one day Maxchina will have no money to support space leading data loss and forum breakdown. But it's not today!  Today, MaxChina needs members! Today, MaxChina needs conducting! Today, MaxChina needs managing! Today, MaxChina is our home, our family!  No matter you are a member of Maxchina or not, we salute you. Make advertisement for us no matter what you do!! And become a member!  Die for Maxchina!  Live for Maxchina!  Rebirth for Maxchina!  Do Remember! Tomorrow may not be fantastic! But fantastic tomorrow will surly come!     Members of Maxchina. 23rd Feb. 2004 8th April 2004                                       Translated on 26th April 2004                                                          Being with you forever`````

          Hunan is a province that lies in the middle of south China. It lies middle reaches of Yangtze Rive. Most part of Hunan lies in the south of the Dongting Lake. So it has the name Hunan, which means South Of the Lake. The longest river running through Hunan is the Xiang River, so you can call Hunan Province Xiang for short. Mountains around east south and west surround Hunan. The highest altitude is the Mountain LEI which height is 2122m. The lowest altitude is HUANGGAI Town which is 21m above the sea level. By the end of 2001, there are 13 main cities and 1 autonomous region in Hunan which capital city is Changsha. Hunan province is one of the provinces that have the largest population. It has a population of 65.9585 million ranking 7th of the whole country. The top seven provinces are Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Sichuan and Hunan.

The main minority (ethical) groups areTujia(2.6395million),Miao(1.9215million)Dong(0.8421million)Yao(0.7046millon). They all keep open house.  Hunan has a long history. Long before 10000 years ago, human beings have settled down here for 4 rice paddies have been discovered. In ancient China, Hunan is known as the Chu Empire.  Hunan government of PRC was founded in August 1949.  There are a lot good to eat in Hunan. I'd like to introduce a very special kind. It's called Smelly Tofu.     It smells bad, but it's very tasty. It may sound strange.      However, you will like it after you take a bite. And you will never forget the Smelly but tasty tofu.     The government is encouraging the people to develop the tourism. There are a lot of beautiful places to visit. Zhangjiajie, the national park with natural beauty, attracts millions of tourists to come and visit. Zhangjiajie National Forest Park is located in the southwest end of Wulingyuan, neighboring Suoxi valley scenic zone and Tianzi mountain nature scenic zone. It has an area of 72,000 mou, and annual mean temperature is 16 centigrade. With the 240-300 day frostless season a lot of rainfall, it has a forest coverage percentage of 97% and woody plant as many as 98 families 517species, which is more than twice the species all over Europe.  The Gymnosperm species here has covered half of those in the world. Zhangjiajie National Forest Park was open to outside at the beginning of 1980's, it is the earliest developed scenic zone in Zhangjiajie city. It is famous for various peaks, deep and quiet rivers and elegant forest. In 1982, it got formal approval from State Department to be the first national forest park of our country. The main sight spot includes Jinbian rivulet, Huangshi stockaded village etc. In this area, multiple peaks stand high like giant bamboo shoot sticking to the sky, the broken rocks and cliff distribute along Jinbian rivulet with ancient trees. What a wonderful original scene! Rivulets spread out among mountains like colored ribbons. Viewing mountains on the top of Huangshi stockaded village, you can't help sighing with emotion for its great momentum and ever-changing spectacle.                                                       Welcome to Hunan!!

        It’s been a long time since I wrote last time. It’s always that we could start well but hardly end well. Easier to begin than to insist and finish. School days were so tiring but substantial. I did a lot of sports. I studied hard in school but not at home. I felt so tired that I was not willing to do anything but to sleep. This week, I didn’t spend my time with SUN, because I had to teach my classmate math. But I got 100 yuan in return. She has already had her exam. Hope she passed it. And I will get some more money because I help others to do some other things. I started to earn money. That’s what I was so excited about!  I remember my first ‘salary’. When I was in junior school, we went out and performed for a big supermarket for a whole morning. I got just poor 5 yuan. At first we could not get that. It was supposed to buy us lunch box. But they decided to give it to us instead of buying lunch for us. Then I happily left there with my first ‘salary’ in the hand. After I got home, I put it in a big book carefully. I didn’t use it. It’s still in the piano book. This time, when I got the money, I asked SUN, with whom I spent my noontime, to go to Mc…. We spent 36.

        On Friday, I was arguing over a question with SUN. we couldn't work it out and we couldn't come to terms either. So I made book with him. if i was right he would wear shorts to school for one week. then he said, if i lost, i had to get all my hair cut, then go to school bareheaded. After checked the book, i knew i lost. i had to get all my hair cut. but i kind of didn't like that. i had never been bareheaded since i was a baby. after all, it's so embarrassing. i called him to know whether i was allowed not to have my hair cut. i begged him. but he said NO!!! i was so embarrassed and angry with him for he was my best friend. however it's not his fault. then, today (Saturday) i went to barber with my sister. i asked the barber to cut all my hair. i was so nervous then. The barber said nothing but to get started right after I told him I wanted bareheaded. My dearest hair was falling down as my heart's beating so fast. I didn’t know what I would be like. Very fast half of my head had been done. My scalp was so white. No time for thinking, hair had gone! I looked at myself in the mirror. Was that me?? however, it’s not that bad. At least my head is inerratic (round, not very strange).it's not as ugly as i ever expected. I was satisfied with the barber’s work. He made me look not very bad. Then I went home pleasurablely. I felt I was quite different. Whole new feel``````````````~~~ I would get used to that. I told my classmates on QQ. They were all surprised at me. I phoned Linda. Luckily she was not angry. Then until now I was writing what happened. Lol…………………… Okay. Whatever. It happened already.
