      Chris, Tracy, Madeleine, Lilly and Kathy visited us today in Rochester. We had a lot of fun on this quiet and lazy Holiday Monday.  They arrived around 10 AM and stayed here until 2PM. The kids played very well together and the adults just relaxed and talked. The weather cooperated so we stayed outside for most of the time. We also ate outside. We had delicious pork chops grilled on the BBQ, rice, oriental salad, and delicious key-lime pie and banana pie for desert. It was delicious!  It was very nice to be together. We have been so busy lately that we have not had the opportunity to relax and talk for a few hours. We're hoping we can do this again sometime.  The girls enjoyed several activities, like playing with the "Lucky Duck game", playing on the swing, playing on the slide, playing hide and seek and also playing with the tricycles on the back deck. The 4 girls played very well together.  It was a great time. For pictures on this, click on:  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/lucmichaud63

      GOAL OF THIS BLOG: The Bible is not a dust-collecting, old-fashion book that cannot be helpful in 2004 but rather it is God's ultimate how-to book that can help you with your every day life.  Learning and applying the principles given by God in this great book will help you succeed better in managing your every day concerns. I'm excited to start this blog because I'm passionate about the fact the the Bible is helpful to me today and also  teaches me how to become a permanent guest in God's mansion in heaven. My dream is that the Bible can help you achieve the best that God wants you to achieve here on earth and also to achieve the ultimate goal of heaven.  	The Bible itself claims to be practical and useful. In 2 Timothy 3.16-17 God reveals through his word the following :"16All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (NIV)." Notice that the Bible says: "All Scripture is God- breathed. All Scripture therefore is inspired of God and then notice the next part: "is useful". All Scripture is useful, which is the focus of this blog. The Bible IS useful. In other words, the Bible is practical, useful, and a great tool to help us every day. The Scripture thoroughly equips us. Thoroughly means that we are fully equipped and we have everything that we need written in the Bible.  WHO AM I? My name is Luc Michaud, and I'm a tent-making minister in Rochester, MN. I call myself a "tentmaker" or a "tent-making minister" because I pay the bills by working as a pharmacist and then work as a 2nd vocation as a minister. Paul was a minister who supported himself as a tentmaker, which is why I'm using his example and call myself a "tentmaker". I graduated from  urlLink Freed Hardeman University  with a Master's degree in Ministry in 1999. I have been working for 5 years as a tent-making minister with the  urlLink Rochester Church of Christ .   LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BIBLE. If you are interested in learning more about the Bible, I am available to help you through many different ways: E-mail, Instant-messaging, face to face study (if you live in Rochester, MN. If not, I have many contacts who'd love to teach you more about the Bible), or by old-fashion mail. Please contact me at:  urlLink lucmichaud63@hotmail.com  if you're interested

           What are the apocryphal  books?         &nbsp;       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The books of the Bible  - sixty-six in number, from Genesis through Revelation - have been subjected to  every internal and external test imaginable. Their authenticity and canonicity  have been reliably established. There are other books, however, which some  believe should be considered part of the Bible. These books are called the  Apocrypha.        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The apocryphal books.  For the most part, when the Apocrypha is mentioned the fourteen or fifteen books  of the "Old Testament" are meant. However, there are other writings which are  known as the New Testament Apocrypha. The word apocrypha is a Greek word which  means hidden. Apocrypha also can have reference to a book whose origin was  doubtful or unknown. Apocrypha has come to denote books which are non-canonical.  The "Old Testament Apocrypha" are believed to have been written during the  period of 200 B.C. to 100 A.D. Some of perhaps the better known are "The Wisdom  of Solomon", "The Additions to the Book of Esther", and "The First and Second  Maccabees". The "Catholic Bible" often has twelve of these apocryphal books  interspersed among and attached to the undisputed thirty-nine books of the  Hebrew scriptures, I understand.        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Why the apocryphal  books are not considered part of the sacred canon. Josephus (uninspired), Jesus,  and the apostles obviously did not accept these books as inspired of God. Later  historians such as Origen and Jerome, etc. did not recognize these books as  belonging to the Bible.       Beloved, the sixty-six  books found in standard translations (such as the King James, American Standard,  etc.) have the stamp of authenticity and canonicity. These books are profitable  because they constitute scripture (see 2 Tim. 3: 16-17). The Apocrypha is  uninspired and not part of the Bible.            ---------------------------------------------------------         Visit my blog: &nbsp;   http://christianhumor.blogspot.com/

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Has Man Outgrown the Gospel?          &nbsp;      Time is changing. The new  soon becomes old; the modem becomes ancient; the technological breakthrough  becomes yesterday's news; the popular becomes lost in the latest; and the  up-to-date is soon out-of-date.         &nbsp;      Eternal truth never  changes. It reads the same today as yesterday and as it will tomorrow. It is  "once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 3). Those who would change it  become "accursed" (Gal. 1:69) and find that it will meet them in judgment  unchanged (Rev. 20:12).         &nbsp;      Modem man feels he has  outgrown the ancient gospel. He thinks an absolute standard is obsolete.  Exaltation of self and sensuality replace the idea of sin and spiritual death.  He ridicules blood and the need for forgiveness. He scoffs at the virgin birth,  sinless life, sacrificial death, and miraculous resurrection of Christ. He  regards these as myths of a bygone era.         &nbsp;       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Has Man Outgrown the Gospel?         &nbsp;      Never! The only way man  can outgrow the gospel is to conquer sin. He has not. "All have sinned and come  short of the glory of God" was true in Paul's day and is true today. Sin is  still the transgression of the law of God (I John 3 :4), which can include  violating one's conscience (   Rom.         14:23), omitting a duty  (James 4:17), and lawlessness (I John 3:4).         &nbsp;      Never! God, not man,  determines what is sinful; sin will not change. Men may call sin by another  name, but that will not alter what it really is. Forgiveness is still the most  basic spiritual need that man has (Rom. 3:23; 6:23). The only way a person can  be forgiven is through the gospel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Rom. 1: 16).          &nbsp;      Never! The gospel is the  power to overcome temptation (Eph. 6:17), and man needs its power because  temptation is still with us. Mankind has not conquered carnal desires. He still  gives in to the lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life  (I John 2:15-17). He cannot overcome without the power of the written word (Heb.  4:12).         &nbsp;      Never! The devil is still  "as a roaring lion" walking about "seeking whom he may devour" (I Pet. 5:8). Man  is still in danger; therefore he needs the unchanged gospel, for it is God's  great power to save. When humans can defeat Satan without the truth, then they  will no longer need the truth.       They cannot. No one is  strong enough to conquer the Evil One without an "it is written" (Matt. 4: 1 -1  1).         &nbsp;      Never! The soul of man  needs food. If man could invent a substitute for "soul food," he would not need  the gospel, but he has not. Peter stated that the soul feeds on the "sincere  milk of the word" (I Pet. 2:2), and Paul wrote that he could progress to eat  "strong meat" from the hand of God (Heb. 5:12-14). The gospel fills those who  "hunger and thirst after righteousness" (Matt. 5:6).         &nbsp;      Never! Man still needs a  map to heaven. Men try to invent a roadway to heaven, but these maps will only  get one lost. If we follow the road of "faith only" or the lane of "direct  operation of the Holy Spirit" or the path of "once saved always saved," we are  traveling a broad way that leads to destruction (Matt. 7:13-14). Only Christ and  his gospel can lead one to heaven (John 14:6). "I must needs go home by the way  of the cross; there's no other way but this."         &nbsp;      Jesus plainly stated the  conditions by which men can reach much needed salvation. A sinner must believe  in Christ (Mark 16:16), decide to change his sinful life (repent) (Luke 13:5),  confess the sweet name of Christ (  Rom.   10:9-10), and be baptized for  the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38;         Rom.     6:4). We can choose to  heed these scriptures or harass them, to read them or reject them, to respect  them or ridicule them. Still, the same ancient gospel is the cure for all the  spiritual ills of men! Why not obey today?         &nbsp;        ---------------------------------------------------------         Visit my blog: &nbsp;   http://christianhumor.blogspot.com/

           How can I derive the most  from studying the Bible?         &nbsp;    Answer: It is commendable  that we desire to profit from studying the greatest book man has ever known, the  Bible. All the confusion, division, and misunderstanding is evidence of the need  to properly study the scriptures.        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Approach the Bible with  the right attitude. We must be aware of its importance - basis of faith,  sanctification, and it shall be the standard of judgment (Rom. 10: 17, Jn. 17:  17, Jn. 12: 48). To be good students we must have an open mind (Acts 17: 11),  study believeingly (Acts 27: 25), and study with resolve to perform the Bible's  teaching (Acts 10: 33-48).       We must rightly divide the  scriptures. The scriptures are characterized by symmetry, sequence, and  organization. When people randomly approach the Bible, chaos is inevitable. Paul  taught Timothy to "handling aright the word of truth" (2 Tim. 2: 15, ASV). There  are a number of time periods in the Bible (periods involving animal sacrifice,  etc.). Also, the Old and New Covenants with their endemic teaching must be  acknowledged (Heb. 7; 8).        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Observance of basic  rules of study. There is diligence and work involved in profitably studying the  scriptures (2 Tim. 2: 15). Words must be understood and observed, the context,  the general theme of a given book should be known. Always observe by whom  spoken, to whom spoken, prevailing circumstances, pertinent customs, and  consider related verses. The general method of study will determine resultant  belief. Always, then, employ the inductive method - taking all said on a given  subject and arriving at a forced conclusion  (deduction).      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W e are to prove all  things and hold fast that which is good (I Thes. 5: 21). We cannot expect heaven  if we add or take away from God's word (Rev. 22: 18, 19). We must take care not  to abuse the scriptures (see 2 Pet. 3: 16).         ---------------------------------------------------------         Visit my blog: &nbsp;   http://christianhumor.blogspot.com/

           Checkable Biblical  Accuracy    In each of the following cases, the Biblical writer had an opportunity to  either state the widely held erroneous belief of his day, or to state a  factually true description. In each case what was stated was true, demonstrating  knowledge beyond the writer's ability and thus necessarily from God.
