      today is my dad's birthday.  so, HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY!  okay, now for the rest of my day.  i spent the majority of my day calling mexican and chinese restaurants to send them information on upcoming lease sites.  most of them yelled at me "you call back tomorrow!"  "i know no maganer (manager)"  one guy told me that his restaurant was owned by Fidel Castro.  needless to say today was a bust.    i'm going to the doctor tomorrow.  nothing is wrong with me but i haven't had a general practitioner in five years and now that i have insurance it would be beneficial to establish a raport with one.  maybe he can tell me why i am tired all the time.  my weekend plans are shaping up.  we have a couple of parties to go to and nathan is playing one last show at the oasis before moving to nashville.  by the way, he was signed to yep roc records, the same label as reverend horton heat and caitlin cary (formerly of whiskeytown).  i'm so proud of him!    my posts aren't as entertaining as they used to be.  i guess i'm turning into an old married lady.

      as the title implies i ran out of my meds today which makes me prone to cry at any moment.  one of my co-workers came to me today to tell me not to put our federal tax id number on a general document i was using only for myself.  i took it very personally and when she walked away tears welled up in my eyes.  so silly!  also, my boss made a comment about not making phone calls to restaurants during lunch rush.  logical statement, but not to miss sensitive cry baby-pants.  again, tears welled up in my eyes and i threw my research report across my desk.  thankfully i have insurance now and obtaining my meds doesn't require me to take out a personal loan.  so, now i have my meds and am patiently waiting for them to kick in.  in the meantime i'll surf blogs and take comfort that there are others out there with more comical lives.

      assumably you've seen the pictures posted below and have either laughed or winced.  here is the story behind them:  saturday night kevin and i went to the plaza for a friend's birthday.  after awhile we decided to go to the arena to see the exhibit(s) play.  they were having some casting party for  hedwig and the angry inch  which eric, the lead singer, and carlos, the guitarist, had parts in.  they began to play several songs from the play and i really was not in the mood to be there.    barb, neal and i decided to make our way to bailey's.  when we got there i quickly realized it was not the crowd i was hoping for and convinced the two to go back down to the plaza.  after a few minutes at the plaza jen and stacey come running in and took me by the arms saying something about kevin having an accident.  obviously i was panicked but it didn't really hit me until we reached the street when i saw a fire truck and an ambulance parked in front of the arena.  i started to cry and jen says, "he needs you to be strong right now, he needs you to be calm".  i collect myself and walk in.  andrew, the bouncer, directs me toward the back of the bar where several of my friends are gathered with the EMTs.  kevin is seated in a chair with an ice pack over his face.  when he removed it to look at me i start crying again.  blood was all over his face.  i knelt down in front of him and several drops of blood fell on my shoulder.  he assured me he was okay, that he blacked out and hit the floor.  kevin has a potassium defficiency and coupled with several beers and eating dinner late his body reacted problematically.    i stayed up for pretty much the rest of the night, waking kevin up every hour or so.  he was very sore sunday so i babied him most of the day.  i made him soup and ice packs and we napped at one point.  he began to swell something awful around nine so i decided it was time to rest for the night.  he went to work today and it almost killed me to see him go.  my poor baby.  i'm glad it wasn't too serious.  this incident made me appreciate how much i love him.

      today i did something very girly for the first time ever...i got a manicure.  i've always been a nail biter and was told that i should grow out my nails for the wedding.  so i have been and now they are long enough to drum on the table just loud enough to annoy someone.  i enjoyed the manicure so much that i am going back in two weeks to have another one done and a pedicure done as well!    another first for me was the dream i had last night.  in said dream kevin was in the shower and kenn, our roommate, was also in the bathroom, getting dressed.  kenn's back was to me and he was putting on his boxers.  i noticed he had two sets of jutting nipples on each butt cheek.  the weird part though is that they were blue, and wiggling at me.  when i confronted kenn with his he said, "yeah, i know.  don't tell anyone...i'll never get a date".  kevin started giggling uncontrollably.  that is all for tonight.  i've had a long un-productive, no computer, no desk day. (yes, i'm still bitching)

      so far this week has been semi-productive with a side of career frustration.  being the new kid on the block (hangin' tough) i don't have a specific corner of the office to inhabit yet.  basically i float around waiting for someone to leave their office long enough so i can get some research done on the computer.  i have been promised a desk and a computer by the end of the week.  two of the girls i work with knew the three officers that were murdered last week and they have been out at the funerals the past two days.  that has left me with ample computer time.  tomorrow they will both be back at the office leaving me again to huddle at the conference room table scratching on spreadsheets that will never be updated.  my dad has found the art of "googling" and sent me an email today with his results.  apparently from his results my oldest sister was a sweet potato queen and my middle sister was miss wheelchair texas.  he "googled" me as well and my name came up on  urlLink movie poopshoot  .  this article was written by my friend chance shirley and is a log of his movie  urlLink  Hide and Creep  .  i don't think my dad knows that it is really me in the article, and if he does he certainly isn't admitting that i actually appeared in the film.  i guess i just wrote myself out of the will.

      after many, many weeks of waiting for Kevin's mom to give me her list for the wedding i now have it in my grubby paws.  first, let me say that i want this wedding to be small...as small as possible.  is it too much to ask that on my wedding day i want to be with Kevin and my friends and family?  i want to be able to drink many beers, eat cake, dance and laugh.  i don't want to spend a whole lot of time meeting people i will never see again.  "but liesl, think of all the gifts you will receive."  that is really not all that important to me.  meeting bob, the neighbor Kevin lived next door to when he was two and hasn't seen since just doesn't spark alot of excitement in me.  am i being too bitchy?  it's my day...probably the only day that will revolve entirely around just me and kevin.  so, the list is down to 168 people.  that sounds reasonable because typically only 70% of the people you invite actually show up.  also, we only have four months to go...i just wish it was here now!

      now that i have this high fallutin job as a marketing director i felt it pertinent to aquire a new wardrobe.  so off i went to TJ Maxx to pick out the latest styles of imperfection heaven.  i can't remember the last time i went clothes shopping that required a shopping cart and i found it quite convenient when i chose several blouses and skirts and nowhere to stow them while trying everything on.  at the Maxx they only allow you six items in a dressing room at a time, in case you felt like wandering out into the store in your underwear and socks.  speaking of the dressing rooms the doors on those things are so low everyone walking by can see you struggling to get a shirt over your head.  the best thing though is the conversations people have while in there.  here is one i overheard: Woman 1: "I think I need a (size) 16. Woman 2: "Why?" Woman 1: "My ass be to big!  I use to fit into a 12 until Jermaine knocked my ass up" Woman 2: "Oh shut up! Yo ass always been that big.  Before you had that baby I remember you bent over to pick up your keys one time and the sun disappeared"  regardless of what the Maxx has to offer as far as clothing i think i will always go there just for the laughs.  it's cheaper than the stardome and funnier than a night at the apollo.

      kevin bought me a new desk and chair yesterday at the office store. he also bought himself a new media cabinet for the living room and a dog bed for molly cate. we spent most of the evening putting the furniture together and then watched "the wicker man".  i got up this morning around 8:30 and began to clean the house which  really  needed it. with all the animal fur i swept up i think i could make a new pet. we are going to his parent's house for bbq this evening and to show them the honeymoon packages we found online. come on big money, no whammys!  kevin is now asleep on the sofa and the puppies are lying on the floor in the office with me. lazy day.  note to self: email angela wedding guest list for party at the end of the month.  shopping list:    mouse for computer (my dad stole mine)  extension cord  ceiling light or halogen light for office  curtains for office  speakers for computer (the ones that came with mine never worked in the first place)  dog food (cooper is getting fat so maybe light food for her)

       my friend  urlLink chris  is writer of erotic stories.&nbsp; personally, that has never been my thing but, i can't discriminate.&nbsp; i've always been a writer of the surreal and things that can't happen but probably should.&nbsp; do.&nbsp; you.&nbsp;&nbsp; know.&nbsp;&nbsp;what.&nbsp; i.&nbsp; am.&nbsp; saying.  in the spirit of my wedding and the fact that i will never get to think about this again without feeling guilty here is my personal sexual experience that stands out (and sometimes still fantasize about).&nbsp; shhh, don't tell.  i met jonah* in december of 2002.&nbsp; how we met is not important.&nbsp; neither is the fact that our physical attraction to each other was so blatant that mothers hid their children, concrete split under our feet, and dogs and cats began living with each other.&nbsp; though his feelings for me were always more than i could reciprocate our love making more than made up for any insecurities we might have felt.  the first time is always awkward.&nbsp; it doesn't matter who you are, that is just a fact.&nbsp; you know the general physics of it all, what goes where,&nbsp;administer&nbsp;time equally to each of the erogenous zones, etc.&nbsp; but jonah, no matter how inexperienced, was phenomenal.&nbsp;   the moonlight was cut into slats through the blinds.&nbsp; in the darkness we carressed each other.&nbsp; i loved his face and those big eyes.&nbsp; when we kissed, butterflies flew in a frenzy in my stomach.&nbsp; his tongue, so warm, so sweet, coaxed mine further into his mouth.&nbsp; things progressed, as they do, and jonah helped me undress.&nbsp; as he unclasped my brassiere he kissed my spine, the nape of my neck, the small of my back.&nbsp; he made parts of me tingle that i didn't know existed.  when i got on top of him i felt his hip bones jut into my flesh.&nbsp; he was so fit yet so thin.&nbsp; his skin was transluscent and i watched the veins in his neck pump blood.&nbsp; i kissed those veins.&nbsp; i kissed his ears with their peach fuzz.&nbsp; and i whispered "i need you now" and he began to slowly make love to me.&nbsp; jonah made me orgasm faster than anyone i had ever been with.&nbsp; it was almost effortless.&nbsp; "come with me" i whispered and he began to speed up.&nbsp; I watched his face as he climaxed and it was so peaceful.&nbsp; i thought it strange that he didn't make the typical pained face all guys make when coming.&nbsp; it was as if he was in a zen state.&nbsp;   when all was done, i got dressed and padded outside to have a cigarette.&nbsp; jonah came and sat next to me and put his arm around me.&nbsp; i laid my head against his shoulder and tried to blow smoke rings.  obviously, things didn't work out for us.&nbsp; i was caught between jonah and another man.&nbsp; i decided that not having either one of them was for the best.&nbsp; i will however, miss lying naked next to jonah and tracing his form with my fingers.&nbsp; god, that body.&nbsp; i shiver now just thinking about it. *name has been changed-though he knows who he is.

      i've always been a child of trial and error.&nbsp; don't tell me how to do it just give it to me and i'll figure it out.&nbsp; in that same breath (and with some hypocrisy) i love to read how-to books.&nbsp; how-to build a model airplane, how-to plan a wedding, how-to successfully deceive your boss into thinking you're actually working and not posting on your blog.&nbsp; i am by no measure an infinte amount of knowledge.&nbsp; not compared to my better and nicer half, that is.&nbsp;   great.&nbsp; now i lost my train of thought.&nbsp; i have no idea where i was going with that.  anyway, roxy is getting on my last and exposed nerve.&nbsp; i went to get some information from her office and she snapped at me, "I don't like people getting into my stuff".&nbsp; she has a bit of a martyr complex.&nbsp; you know what i'm talking about.&nbsp; your mother-in-law has one too, atleast most of them.&nbsp; if you are not schooled on the art of martyrdom i will enlighten you:  Step One:&nbsp; Perform many menial tasks in one day, i.e. planning a party, washing dishes, driving a car, mowing the lawn  Step Two:&nbsp; Loudly sigh at regular intervals while performing aformentioned tasks, so that family members, friends, people in the next room can hear you  Step Three:&nbsp; Complain about how you do everything while receiving no appreciation  Step Four:&nbsp; Repeat

      our office manager just came up to me and instructed me that i would need to make a schedule for who cleans the dishes here in the office.&nbsp; the schedule will consist of me and another girl here.&nbsp; good lord!&nbsp; i guess because i don't have a college degree that my duties are that of a house cleaner.&nbsp; don't get me wrong, i am happy to pitch in when i can, but i really don't think my talents should be wasted on cleaning other people's dishes.  maybe i should drive out to everyone's house and turn down their beds too.

      work was good today.&nbsp; one of the girls were out today with a "headache" so i was left looking like the golden child.&nbsp; even though i had a cup of coffee around 3 p.m. i came home and was ready to crash.&nbsp; kevin had planned to make barbeque chicken, safron rice and french green beans but i told him not to worry about it, that all i wanted was an ice cream sundae and to go to bed.&nbsp; i napped for about half an hour.&nbsp; a lot of good that did.&nbsp; now the leftovers are in the fridge.  i called father bryan today to find out what the next step would be for the wedding. his response was, "i haven't even seen you at mass.&nbsp; you have to be an active member to be married in this church".&nbsp; i felt angry and guilty.&nbsp; everytime i wake up on sunday morning to go to mass i end up finding something that needs to be done in the house, or kevin is so warm in bed and all i want to do is cuddle up next to him.&nbsp; damn his cuddliness!&nbsp; don't get me wrong, church is not a chore for me.&nbsp; i enjoy practicing my faith, it's calming and meditative.&nbsp; sometimes i like to attend mass in my heart and head.&nbsp; how can i tell father bryan that?  saturday is kevin's nephew's birthday party.&nbsp; i really don't want to go.&nbsp; his mom is only going to pester me about the wedding plans and my "sweet-placating Liesl" act won't hold out for much longer.&nbsp; she is so passive-aggressive!&nbsp; when i told her that my bridesmaids were planning my bridal tea her response was "*sigh* well, i guess i'll just show up then".&nbsp; listen lady, with the way you've been acting this whole time feel priveledged you're even invited!  anyhoo, we have ACT! training on friday...what a completely waste of time that will be.&nbsp; anyone with an electronic address book or FileMaker Pro&nbsp;can operate ACT!&nbsp; maybe we'll get copeland's for lunch though.&nbsp;&nbsp; mmmm, crab cakes.&nbsp;

      here are some more random things that have happened since i last posted:  went to the optometrist to get contacts.&nbsp; he was very nice.&nbsp; now i have said contacts and i hate how i look in them.&nbsp; eh, it's nice to wear sunglasses again.  one of the girls i work with was yelling at everyone today.&nbsp; literally.&nbsp; at one point she came over to me explaining why she was being a bitch and i just sat there, arms crossed, hoping she would go away.  my roommate is out of town at his girlfriend's house and i'm kind of glad he's gone.&nbsp; every since he started dating her he has become untolerable.&nbsp; he's always complaining that the puppies poo in his office...well, i came home the other day (the girls had been in their crates) and there was a pile of crap on the floor.&nbsp; apparently  his  cats have been the culprits.&nbsp; also, before he left, i noticed he had a dvd that i wanted to watch.&nbsp; when i asked if i could watch it&nbsp;he said "no" because it was his friend's dvd.&nbsp; he then said, "by the way, i hate it when you two watch my dvd's before i can.&nbsp; god, i miss living by myself."&nbsp; to this i responded, "fine, then move out!" and i stormed off.&nbsp; i like it better when he was lonely and depressed.  i got my  urlLink wedding dress  in!&nbsp; it's so lovely.  i need to start swimming again, but there are no pools here in southside and all the health clubs want you to sign in blood to join.&nbsp;   walking through the  urlLink rose garden  again! this is the second time this month.&nbsp; my body is completely gone to hell ever since the accident.

      jeremy and i went to lunch on saturday and he told me about damon's latest act of terrorism.&nbsp; if anyone knows damon, he is one of those people who will sabotage you and sit around laughing about it while drinking a beer with his buddies.&nbsp;&nbsp;he's like my little brother and i love him, but he can just be mean. &nbsp; as i may have mentioned,&nbsp;damon left for korea sometime last week for a year.&nbsp; he apparently left a bag of dirty laundry at derek's house.&nbsp; derek decided that he was going to throw it out to spite damon for leaving it.&nbsp; as derek opened the bag, a swarm of fleas flew out and covered the room.&nbsp; i can only imagine the obscenities ushered from his mouth.&nbsp; $200 to the Orkin man&nbsp;later derek has his apartment back, no worse for the wear.&nbsp; i would pay good money to read the email that derek sent damon after this debauchle. &nbsp; in other news, BA and i went out friday night to bailey's and the plaza.&nbsp; i was having a decent time until i realized that BA was telling everyone that i was engaged just so they wouldn't talk to me.&nbsp; i certainly do not go out like i used to, and when i do i don't want to try to "hook up".&nbsp; i guess she's just envious.&nbsp; i cannot help that i may be more outgoing, less aggressive than she is.&nbsp; and it doesn't help to talk to her about it.&nbsp; she knows she does it, i've confronted her about it before.&nbsp; besides, she'll just say that i act like i'm better than her.

      i stayed home from work yesterday due to a massive migraine.  i don't get them as often as i did as a kid.  when i do get them i go cross-eyed, i'm nauseas, i can barely type or think.  i took some medication specifically for migraines but all it did was make me sleep for about six hours.    so, here i am, back at work, still with a dull ache in my temples.  i'm still nauseas, although i did manage to eat a wendy's jr. hamburger and drink some sprite.  all i can think of is crawling back in bed, shutting the curtains and lie down with a cold compress.  i feel a little guilty though.  my boss had a root canal yesterday and he is back at work and not complaining (much).  poor, little Liesl with her headache and upset tummy.

      i'm into my Tudor kick again...that is to say that i have been reading alot on the monarchy of England.  it really interests me.  the pomp and circumstance of it all, the murderous affairs, betrayals, incest, homesexuality, genocide...it's all quite disturbing.  i can only compare it to an ten car pile up on 59/20.  you know you shouldn't look but do anyway.  i got into this obsession back in 2000 when i was going through RCIA at Our Lady of Lourdes.  we were beeing stuffed full of information regarding the Reformation and it just stuck to me.  when the time came to choose our confirmation name I chose Elizabeth.  not for Elizabeth Anne Seton, but for Elizabeth I.  though she was a devout Protestant i could not fault her for being so adamant and true to her people. blah, blah, blah i know.  what happened to the fun Liesl who went out every weekend and always had a funny story about getting drunk and making fun of people?  never fear, she's still here.  BTW-bright eyes, if you read this drop me a line.  knob slobberer's friend told me you got back in town.

      work was pointless today.  i did a lot of work early which left me twiddling my thumbs until 2 p.m.  i finally asked if i could go home.  no one was in the office due to the holiday.  we did close a $5 mil job today which makes everyone happy!    i got a new cell phone today.  yea! i'm not technologically challenged any longer.  so if you need my number email me and through a series of tests, including blood and urine and an extensive credit check i may give it to you.    by the way, i mentioned earlier this week that i was going to the doctor.  i failed to give the update so here it is:  my new physician is a man who is a towering 6'11"  and thats his width.  when the nurse walked me into the exam room to get some basic information and vitals she asked if i would be using doctor ross* for my "feminine needs".  i glanced at the walls that were covered in sports memorabilia and autographed photos of athletes and coaches and said "i'm not sure i feel comfortable with bear bryant and tiger woods watching".  she chuckled and walked out of the room, leaving the door open.  now, it may just be me, and i may have only been there to  meet  dr. ross, but i'm pretty sure you don't leave exam room doors ajar for other patients and staff to walk by and see you.  after a few moments, the doctor walks in and abruptly states, "i don't see anything in your chart that tells me why you are here".  i explain to him that i only wanted to establish a patient/doctor relationship and get my medical record in their files.  as he is scribbling in my chart i notice that he too has left the door open.  he began to ask standard, yet personal questions about me and i felt i had to whisper so that the high school quarterback in the adjacent room wouldn't hear that i am on birth control.  regardless, dr. ross does write me a years prescription for zoloft, which is easier to obtain than going to a doc-in-the-box.  i'm ready for the weekend!  a couple of parties, a bbq, and i'm getting my new couch!  i'll fill you in on how it all goes.  correction:  the girl i work with whose sister's boyfriend was killed was falsely stated as dying in a wreck.  he was actually killed in iraq.  sorry.

      i'm always waiting for the bottom to fall out.  it did once before...and it can happen again.  this month has brought endless suffering and turmoil to those around me.  here is why:  about a month or so ago when i started my new job, the assistant in our huntsville office, suzanne, boyfriend was in a car accident and died.  then, the three police officers that were gunned down were friends with two of the girls in my office.  now, another girl i work with, mckenzie, her sister's boyfriend was also in a car accident and died.  everyone is freaked out at work.  i wanted to call kevin and tell him he couldn't get in his car or go to the ghetto.    i think i'm numb to this chaos.  when kevin hurt himself i think that was the first time i've really showed any emotion in almost a year.  even at benny's (my old boss' son) funeral i was stoic.  before that it was murph and that was where i think i got most of my scar tissue.    could everyone do me a favor?  don't die on me.  i know it's hard, but just try.  no more funerals for me.

      this weekend came and went with little fanfare. there were a couple of moments that are actually worth mentioning, but because i drank too much on friday i don't remember them.  alyce and i went out friday night to dinner at the red horse tavern. i was happy to see some of my old killarney's friends there. obviously, going out to dinner with alyce is never just dinner. we went to the plaza to play pool and by the time we got to bailey's to meet kevin i could barely remember my own name. funny, i didn't even drink that much. anyhoo, alyce and i parted ways around 3 a.m. and my roommate and i went to get a bite to eat. i did get a message from alyce the next morning saying that she was okay but did something she is not supposed to tell me but will anyway. atleast it wasn't a call from jail...AGAIN!  i spent most of saturday passed out with my head in the toilet. kevin thought i was trying to reenact " urlLink the exorcist ". once i felt better i parked myself on the sofa for a law and order:svu marathon. sunday, i tidied up a bit and cleaned up the vomit stench in the bathroom. around 9 p.m. adolph, my roommates cat, was so sick i took him to the emergency vet. poor little buddy. looks like he has a touch of a URI.

      it's friday the 13th...oooh spooooky! now is the time for all the freaky freakys to come out of the woodwork. however, with the impending mayhem i was thinking about hurricane charley set to hit ground sometime today (if he hasn't already). it got me thinking about the blizzard of '93. remember that? they coined it as the "storm of the century".  i was 14 that march and was quite sick. my mom took me to the doctor who told me i had laryngitis  and  walking pneumonia. it was sunny and warm out which made my fever that more unbarable. that evening the weather man spoke of colder temperatures but it was not anything like he predicted. sometime during the night my mom woke me up and told me to look outside. the snow flakes were the size of golf balls and the wind howled against the our house.  when i woke up the next morning the ground was covered in 12" of snow with 24" snow drifts. in some parts of the state 6' drifts were reported.  our power was out, but the phones were working. my parents and i camped in the living room where the fireplace was. my dad barricaded the rest of the house with heavy-duty plastic to keep out drafts into our new living space. our meals consisted of cereal, chili cooked in a pot in the fireplace and grilled corn and chicken on the propane grill. mom saved all the refrigerated perishables by putting them in a snow drift on our porch. dad ran boiling hot water into the bathtub to keep the bathroom warm.  for three days we lived like this. on the fourth day my illness was increasingly worse. my parent's friends on the next street finally got their power back on. they shuttled me over so i could get a hot shower and a warm bed. really, i think it was so my mom could get a good night sleep.  a day later our power was back on. some of our trees were damaged but we came out relatively unscathed.

      so, i've noticed that blogger is handy in tailoring it's ads at the top with whatever you post about most. the ads i noticed on my blog are about puppy mills. i'm wise to you blogger! i see the petty games you play!  here is my new experiment: i want to see how tailored they are. for example, if i post about jungle monkeys working at the Winn-Dixie will they advertise bananas or Swiffer WetJet (you know, for all the flung feces)? how about this:  woman slips on dildo and breaks her mandula oblongata.  sailor scowls at hearing "sea-men" joke for umpteenth time.  my bologna has a first name, it's o-s-c-a-r.  how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?

      okay, here is a question for all you loyal readers, that needs your opinion: i have a tattoo on my back between my shoulder blades of a  urlLink nautical star .  it is approximately 3 inches x 3 inches in blue and black.  my wedding dress drops below, making said tattoo quite visible.  my mom thinks i should cover it up  with make up to avoid grandparents and elderly relatives alike from dropping dead in the pews. my bridesmaids think i should leave it alone.  i really don't care, as i will not be looking at it.  what do you guys think?  p.s.  please don't offer the "what ever makes you happy" or "it's your wedding" responses.  put yourself in the shoes of a guest...would you care staring at it?

      according to my online wedding consultant/organizer now is the time to be taking better care of my body. their examples include cutting down on caffeine, tobacco, and fatty foods. okay, do the people at theknot.com want me to to blaze down the aisle with a machete, slicing the heads off of my guests? i know these are simply suggestions but who are they kidding?  in a half-assed attempt i have had only one serving of caffeine today (compared to my pibb xtra and coffee fix) and three cigarettes (compared to...well...um, three cigarettes).  in a couple of weeks kevin and i have to attend the Engaged Encounter retreat that is required by the Catholic church. that should be fun!!!  (note extreme sarcasm and eye-rolling)   enough with this wedding crap! if it were up to me, and essentially it is, we would get married at the courthouse. however, being the dreamy, doe eyed idiot that i am i insisted on a cathedral wedding complete with drunken bender reception. i had my druthers with the alcohol list and their will be plenty of Irish Car Bombs downed by the wedding party. i'm mostly looking forward to the reception and the honeymoon. being the irish lass that i am i began working on my tan this weekend. i don't tan...i freckle. sad, really. (sidenote - hey z-bear, remember when i used to name your freckles? i was so cute back then!)  anyhoo, time for a smoke break.

      after that debaucle at dr ross's office i decided to go to one of those doc-in-the-box that litter the alabama country side.  luckily, when i walked in at 5:30 p.m. there was only one patient waiting to be seen.  i was escorted back in to the exam room shortly after i arrived.  the doctor was incredibly sweet!  i explained how exhausted i've been and he asked several questions, listened to my chest sounds and felt my lymph nodes.  "well young lady" he said matter of factly, "your lymph nodes are unusually large.  have you ever had mono?"  "nope" i replied.  "let's take some blood and see what is going on with you". the doctor called in the nurse and she preceded to tourniquet my arm and complimented me on my veins. "too bad i'm not a heroin addict, huh?"...not even a chuckle. doc came back in a few minutes later and actually showed me the results!  he didn't sit down and tell me the results, he actually explained them to me.  i've never seen such fantastic care.  however, doc didn't find anything abnormal.  no anemia, no mono, no nothing.  he said he would send it off for a thyroid profile and scheduled me to come back in a week.  he told me that until my next appointment i should begin a daily regimen of vitamins and lots of water.  bleh!  i hate water!  it's so...so tasteless.  if only they made dr. pepper flavored water.  yum!  i left the doc-in-a-box a little disheartened.  if nothing was wrong with me then what is?  i'm not overly stressed...atleast i don't think i am.  oh well.  on a lighter note, kevin booked our honeymoon trip today.  looks like we're going to the Sandals Royal Carribean Resort in Montego Bay, Jamaica.  better pack my SPF 3500.

      my appointment was scheduled for nine a.m. so me, being the early bird, got there about 8:45.  you just never know what forms they will make you fill out.   my name was called around nine and the assistant took me back to the exam room.  she asked why i was there and other health related questions.  she then told me the doctor would be in to see me in a few minutes.  one People magazine and two Good Housekeepings later i glanced at my watch.  it was 9:50.  i had been there for over an hour!  i saw the assistant walk by and asked her how much longer it would be.  "he's coming right around the corner" she replied and dashed off.  i call kevin to vent my frustration and he agreed that my waiting there was ridiculous.  i decided to give the doctor another ten minutes.  i glance at my watch again...10:15.  "for christ's sake!" i said under my breath.  i grabbed my things and walked out of the exam room and up to the reception desk.  i looked at the receptionist and said, "i have been here for almost an hour and have yet to see dr. ross"  she looked at me blankly.  "what is the point for scheduling an appointment when the doctor does not abide by it?  i understand i don't have a broken limb or am bleeding from every orifice but i am just as important as someone who is!" "oh...would you like to reschedule?"  she asked sweetly "no.  you've wasted my time already.  i'll find another doctor." i retorted as i was walking to the elevator i heard someone say, "you're not alone" .  i turned to see who said that and a lady sitting in the waiting room said "this is our third reschedule.  we haven't even met the doctor."  needless to say, i'm going to find another doctor.

      i'm about to leave to go to my doctors appointment.  and this morning sealed the fact that i  really  need to go.  i could not get out of bed to save my lilly white behind.  i told kevin this morning that i hope it is nothing serious but i do hope it is  something  just so i don't feel like a hypchondriac.   i have noticed that when things go wrong your friends will say the shittiest things.  i spoke with a friend last night and she said "it's probably all just in your head".  well if it's in my head why is my body suffering?   i'll update when i get back.

      it doesn't matter if i get 8 hours of sleep or 12 hours.  it doesn't matter if i eat healthy foods or fast food.  i could exercise all day or be a couch potato.   i am always exhausted!   yesterday when i got home from work i let the puppies out and then crashed for about and hour and a half until kevin called me to dinner.  this has been going on for a few weeks now and i am increasingly becoming concerned.  i even looked up Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Anemia on webmd.com.  i certainly would not self-diagnose myself, that is just not safe, but, reading the symptom list Anemia could be the problem.  i called my general practitioner to schedule an appointment on friday.  maybe he can do a lab work up and see if anything turns up.  i also spoke to minnesota to try and schedule a Reiki session.  if anything, i would get a good nap out of it.

      the roles have been reversed with me and my parents (or is it my parents and i?).  i have been trying to call my mom for the past two days and keep getting her voicemail.   sidenote: my parents sold my childhood home a month ago and they are living in a mobile home park in their 2000 edition, 35 foot long Winnebago.   i begin to worry.  this is not like my parents at all.  sure they are retirees, but you can't just pick up and leave and not tell your children.  i call my aunt in atlanta.  no word.  i call both of my sisters.  no word there either.  i call my dad's best friend, nada.  i can't remember the name to the mobile home park so i just start randomly calling in the area.  i finally reached the right place and spoke with a nice man who understood my situation and tells me that they said they were going to lake lanier.  i leave another voice message for the 'rents again.  "what do you mean, just leaving the state and not telling me?!  i am about to file a missing persons report.  for all i know you could be dead in a ditch somewhere!"  doesn't that sound familiar?  needless to say mom called me back.  unfortunately i was away from my desk and she had to leave me a message.  darn it!  i was going to ground her for a month!

        drama - if you've got it, get away from me!  car stereos turned up so loud it shakes your windows  wasps  dating bartenders  people who don't like my dogs  cats - they are spiteful creatures  people who say they "love" a band, but only because of one song on the radio - i told you i was a music snob  people who use you up   that is about it for now.  i'm not in a particularly hateful mood today, so there isn't much to put on the list.  it's early though.
