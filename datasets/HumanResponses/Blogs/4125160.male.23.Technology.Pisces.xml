       i really feel so bad about myself tonight.before i walked in to the floor of our office,i was wearing a pretty sweet smile coz i feel so inspired for my precious had promised me that i can have all of her time next week.and when i finally got in to the office after having a mouthful yakitori bento for dinner,i take calls(well as a part of my system),and received a message from my precious and then again i was smiling while reading her short message until she just sent me something that really changed my mood...something that really turned my smile into a frown...shes starting to scrutinize things with me again...well its ok coz she have my full authority to access my email,friendster and that kind of stuff.what makes it worst is that she started to yell at me regarding the homepages that i last visited.i know that she felt bad and made her blood rise when she saw the name of that girl...well,to the best of my knowledge i never really visited that homepage I SWEAR TO GOD I NEVER DID!even if you put me into a lie detector test...im pretty much confident in saying this coz i never really did..i know how to accept my mistakes...what makes me really upset is that shes telling me that shes sick and tired of it,(well maybe of my excuses too),that she just went in to bed without even saying goodnight.try to believe in me,i know that i broke her trust before and i know how hard it is for her to trust me again.but i promised that ill be true to her all the time after all what happened before.i just hope that she can forgive and forget,that she can let go of the past,let all by gones be by gones.i admit that ive hurt her feelings before and im really sorry for that,i promised that ill make it up all to her,to cope up with all of my shortcomings.honestly im still working hard on how to gain back her trust...remembering all the things that just happened tonight really makes me feel bad,that makes me feel that i really cannot handle relationship well,that i sucks.on the second thought,do i really suck?knowing all of the effort i did?haaaaggghhhh!

       i used to  be a person that is too sacred and fear so much in falling in love...i used to think that i would always end up being alone when the love has gone...i used to think that i cannot handle relationship pretty well coz ive been on and off a relationship for quite sometime now until i reach the point that i burned out and gave up the feeling of falling in love and being inlove...   well,that is used to be..its all gone now...   im so glad that i had the chance to meet mariele,the girl that i never really look at or even took notice of.mariele had given me the reason to believe in the power of love again,the girl that put the smile back in my lips and the person that touched my heart and enlightened me again...   i consider her as "my precious"...the most precious gift i ever received!   mariele is my litle  miracle...   nobody can ever replace mariele inmy heart, coz nobody else can have the guts she have to take the risks of knowing me and having me and loving me...mariele had given me unconditional love,give me respect,understand me,give me importance and make me feel special and most of all accepting me inside out...   i will love mariele till the very last day of my life
