      yah, crazy storms outside this week. haven't posted for a while, anyways, but  tomorow i leave for michigan.  im kinda happy, im getting a little restless here. you know, cabin fever. its not that it's boring, but i sometimes needs a little change of scenery. oh, saturday ryan and i went to see Shrek 2 which was hilariously funny. Just about every fairy tale and nursery rhyme were made fun of or had a satire about them in that movie.  Then  he fixed my computer so that i FINALLY have aim now. I know, I'm such a dinosaur!  finished packing today which was just a magical experience. I think that if I go to hell at the end of my days, my punishment for all of my evils will be the task of packing for eternity. WOW that would suck. Anyway, that was pretty much the sum of the last couple of days. My life is so exciting, I know.

      Today was my first full day of knowing that on Monday, I'll have absolutely nothin' to do. That will be friggin' amazing. I really can't wait for summer to really begin. Went out with Ryan tonight. We saw Shrek 2. God that was hilarious. First of all, there were referances to literally every fairy tale one could possibly think of. I mean everything: The Three Little Pigs, Cinderella, and there was this great spoof of Hollywood called Far Far Away land where there was a street that looked suspiciously like Rodeo Drive. Before that, Ryan and I went to Stir Crazy, this amazing Asian restaurant where I had yummy sweet and spicy chicken. Ummmm. Tomorrow is church and that's cool. Anyway, sorry I haven't posted in a while. Laters.  Oh, P.S. I really don't think kevin reads this, but on the offhand chance that he does, thanks for the tip about lung cancer and all that. Really, Like no one's ever told me that before! I am forever in your debt.

      So, I'm here at school right now, getting ready for my first exam. I really should be reviewing my formulas for geo, but o well.   I'm extremelly jealouse of the people I know who do not have to be at school today, namely any senior at Desmet. If you are reading this Ryan/Billy/Bob, know that I envy you with my soul.  On a good note, I am excited to be able to leave at twelve thirty after my bio exam. I'll probly take it easy and sleep. Sleep is good, though so is Bread Co.  Well, back to the diagram of a schematic animal cell...

      Kay, here's the deal. I don't think that it is fair for there to be a technology meeting after school for and entire friggin' hour when I have a friggin' bio test to cram for TOMORROW!!!  oK. Done with my venting. I was just so frusterated at the tech people that I decided to not go.I'll probably get a detention. Oh well. Haven't had one all year.   Anywho, caint talk much now 'cause of the impending test... Now I get to learn all about organisms.  Nevermind that the pages of my frog lab got stuck together with frog juice therefore preventing me from getting an A on the darn thing... Sorry. C-ya.

      Hey y'all. So this morning I got an e-mail from my bf saying the darn adress to this blog didn't work. I should probly mention that I don't have very good luck with computers. Anyway, if you had to go thru hell and back to figure out how to get onto this site, I thoroughly apologize for the lack of positive success. Either way, you're here now:)  So, I'm going to this graduation party today and I'm a bit nervous because all of Ryan' fam is going to be there. I mean, I love his family, its just that whole, I hope I come off in a good way. I try to always be myself, it's just that at times myself is a bit "unique" and I tend to ramble, (see name of blog). Anyway, I'm excited. It'll hopefully be a good time.  I was thinking about what I read last night on Ryan's posts and it was cool to see things from his perspective. I feel I got to know things about him that are a bit further below the surface. It's a good thing.   Well, my grandma's calling me to come make eggs for Sunday breakfast. It's the only day of the week I get to play Emeril. (Don't ask) C-ya.

      So, hi, my name's Lauren and I live in St. Louis.  Hmmm... stuff about me... Well, I go to a private girls high school and I am a sophomore. No I do not dress like Britney Spears in her "Baby One More Time" music video. My uniform actually sucks. Anyway, yeah. I like theater and have been in some shows both at my school and a local boys high school.  I set up this blog so my closest friends(who know who they are,) can read about my day, and basically read my random ramblings,as the title clearly states.   I should be studying for exams, but I am so NOT doing that right not. Oh well, like getting good grades actually matters?  Yesterday I went to a party for my friend Billy after being invited by Ryan after going to DeSmets DDP picnic. That was some fun stuff. Yeah, especially when we talked about turtle erections.... er I mean... Nevermind. But if you ever see a turtle flipped over on the road, you have my permission to giggle suspiciously.  Well, I'll post more later. Ryan if you are reading this, thanks for the idea.

      The street was cold, the cobblestones under her feet like ice, as the thick fog surroungded her. Eponine, the fragile waif,translucent angel, innocent criminal, stood at the corner watching, waiting for him to come. She knew he would After all, no man inher father's gang would dare break a promise that involved a profit. Her courage was fed only at the thoguht of sweet Azelma being fed. Her sister was worse off than she, less street wise, and more susceptable to her father's thievery.  Standing, facing away from the wall, she pressed her back up against the stone and felt the vertebra of her too frail body bump the hard surface through the thin, stained chemise she wore. She stood like that in the mist, wishing she could shrink herself and become a pard of the wall, become invisible.  "Please don't come, please dont come. Dear God if you remain with me, please don't come.  But of course he did.  Eponine saw the tall figure approaching long before, perhaps he even saw her. A flicker of fear surged through her. "Run, now! Get away. He hasn't seen you yet!"But duy was duty, and money was money, no matter how dirty, no matter the bargain.  He came swaggering toward her and smiled sickly baring ugly yellow teeth within a thin mouth, a sharp jaw covered with stubble, and stringy, greasy hair. She knew him. Montparnasse. Would that his name be spit upon, damned forever. "Ah, my lovely." he drawled drunkenly swaying close to her. "What brings you here all... alone at night?" Staggering he pressed one dirty hand against the wall above her head and leaned down to her so that she could smell the foul stench of cheap ale on his breath.  "You know why I am here. I am here for the payment. I hae my father's money to repay you. And I am not your lovely. I belong to no one." She retorted, her bravery surprised even her, a poor street rat, though it was true what she had said. She had no one.  "Impudent brat!" He spat. "How dare you show such insolence to me. No wonder your father speaks of you with such distaste. CLearly, you are good for nothing better than to steal, or to beg." he grabbed her roughly and shoved her against the wall by her small shoulders. "I will get what I came for, Mademoiselle."  "Here's your money. Take it and leave me." she said, but her voice betrayed her fear. This man, though inebriated, could kill her if he wanted to.  "I'll get my money, I will. But first I'll have you."  Montparnasse grabbed her by the waist and carried her into the alley. She tried to scream, but his cold hand covred her mouth, claiming her cries so no one could hear. Kicking him did no good, for he shoved his wight onto her usinghis size as a weapon.  Tears formed in Eponine's eyes as she realized with horror what this evil wretch of a man was about to do. With prayers to anyone who would listen, she closed her eyes and succumbed to her fate, thinking only of the man she loved and knowing that though she could never have lived up to what he wouldhave wanted, now she would never be good enough for hmm. She was tainted, dirty, and defiled. The night seemed to go on and on, though she wanted the sun more than anything.  ******************************************************************  Le Baron Marius Pontmercywas walking home from le fafe Musian in the chilly evening. He noted the mist in the air and the smell of tallow as he walked beneath the dim streetlights. The meeting that nght had gone well. It seemed as if their little band of simple, curious students were finally becoming and organized band of strong soldiers.  As he walked,listening to the clicking of his shoes in the darknes, he heard another sound, but quiet faint. Looking about,he tried to discern where it was coming from. I sounded like a small wounded animal. "In Paris?" he thought aloud. There couldn't be such a thing.  Finding it was coming from across the street on his left, he slowly, cautiously approached the alleyway which was shrouded in mist and cloked in the darkness. There he saw a small figure who appeared to be a young girl.  "Mademoiselle?"he inquierd, softly so as not to startle the child.  She turned adn he realized that it was not a child at all, but his friend, Eponine. He was immediately aware of her tear stained face, bloodshot eyes, and the new bruises on her neck and shoulders were frigteningly fresh.  "M'sieur Marius!" she cried, shielding herslef with her arms and rising to booted feet.

      I went to see Gypsy with my mom yesterday. It was at stages and I knew that Zoe was going to be performing in it because Fr. Craig had told us as did Mr. W.  She was a mazing. I was so awestruck at her performance that I was in tears in the audience. She is a true performer and doesn't belong in St. Louis MO. She belongs in New York on a Broadway stage.  There are truly no words to describe my new respect for her. Never again will I be pissed at her perfectionism, because that's what she puts into her performance. It was perfect, and you could tell her whole heart and soul were in every word, every move, every facial expression.  I am so lucky for her to be a choreographer for Villa and Desmet's shows, because clearly she is the best of the best.  On another note, Ryan came over and we spent the whole day together. First, we did some hot tub over some mini diet cokes. After that, we went to see The Terminal with Tom Hanks. That was truly excellent.   Then, he came back to my house and we ate some good pizza and sat in the hot tub with ice cream sodas.  My mom yelled at us when we were in the deep end of my pool because she couldn't see us and thought we were like having sex or something. Right. You know me, the Villa whore.  Anyway, then we hung out upstairs for a little while.  Now, I am thoroughly tired, and am going to end this blog. Goodnight!

      It's true, what my title says. I do know a lot of things. Just not about geometry. Who cares  what the radius time pi is?  We just got our report cards back and I didn't do very well on my math exam. In fact I failed.   I'm smart, though, I really am. I know when my best friend is upset, and I know exactly what to say and how to help him. I know when to keep my mouth shut, or else my sister will go off on me.   I know how to dance, and can do it very well, no matter what Zoe Vonder Haar thinks.   I can sing, I can dance, and I can act. I have an A in chorus.  But in real life, that makes me a nothing. Why couldn't I be good at the important things? Like my sister. She is tall blond,blue eyed, she'll have great boobs when she's older and her skin tans in the most amazing color of peach and brown.   I am short, not fat, but not skinny, I am very pale with freckles on my face and arms. My boobs are okay. My skin isn't great. Yeah. Acne is a pain in the ass. I'm tryin to take care of it. It's working, so far. My hair, well,it's sort of a dirty brownish reddish color that you can't really describe, and my eyes tend to change color from grey to green. I had to put grey on my id because i didn't know what else to say.  No matter what, she will always be the pretty one. She will always be the one they notice first.  Signed The one with the freckles.

      Okay, before I bitch about the whole issue which took place today, I will give some gratuitas fun tidbits.  First: Yay! recital went well. Second:Yay! my boob didn't pop out of my costume. Third: Yay! the hot tub is fixed so I can have friends over!  Okay. Now for my bitch session.  This morning I recieved a call from Ryan who proceeded to ask me if I was okay, told me that I had sent him an email which was incoherent and said something about me taking valium and od ing on it.   Then when I checked my phone, I found that I had like, nineteen new messages from a lot of my friends calling me to ask me if I was okay, if I was alive, if I needed them to come over and help me, and if I needed an ambulance called to my house.   Let me just say, that the person who is now my least favorite person in the world who knows my password can just go jump in the Pacific ocean and get their limbs bitten off by a shark.(And his teeth are rather dull.)  If anyone else who reads this blog recieved this hoax email under my name, it is false, and it did not really occur. Someone thought it would be rather amusing to scare the crap out of my friends, and therefore interfered with my email adress.  Anyway,   I am tired like crazy, so I am going to retire right this instant. Ryan, again I apoligize for the email which scared the crap out of you. Promise it won't happen again.  PS: This "friend" does not know about my blog, nor will I be telling her about it. Therefore, I can and will speak freely about her.  That's all folks.  BTW, if you want to read the Eponine Fanfic I wrote, I can email it to you.  And Dan, yes, it's wonderful.  "The play's the thing!" -Shakespeare

      Hello everyone, literally, one, who reads my blog!  BTW, I was joking about the Valium thing. Very habit forming and bad to take unnecessarily.  Considering the crap I have to do these next two days, though, I might need one just to be able to function.  I just finished yet another rehearsal for the recital piece for "Circle of Life" a nifty modern/lyrical piece with a lot of heart and soul.(No, not like that annoying piano piece you play with two people.) I'm the dance captain for the group and tomorrows our final dress rehearsal.  The only thing is, I'm also in another dance which is a tap routine and we have dress rehearsal tomorrow as well. Therefore, I will be at SLU's theater for literally the entire day. I get there at two, and leave at seven. Then,the day after that, I have to do it all over again for the actual performance for literally hundreds of people, most of which are overly proud parents of three year old beauty queens with pin  curls and Shirly Temple smiles.  So, I'll not only be throwing myself on the ground on purpose for the lyrical/modern dance tomorrow and the next day, but I'll be tapping my heels off of my feet for the tap number too. Isn't life a happy place?  On the other hand, this morning, I did something I never ever thought I would do. I got out of bed at eight o clock after my mom and sis woke me, drowsily walked out of my house in my pjs wich were mighty attractive if I do say so myself, and proceeded to witness a duck and her babies attempting to get themselves out of my pool. You see, they went in for a dip and found the bomenite too slippery for their webbed feet and couldn't climb back out again.   I, of course, came to the rescue by jumping in the water and chasing each duckling all over my pool and finally succeeding getting them all out while trying not to be attaked by the mother duck who was having an apoplectic fit at the fact that I was touching her children. Jeez, you'd think I was Michael Jackson!  Now it is time to relax and thank god for that. Quack!

      Okeydoke,  I know I haven't posted in like a million and four years, but there's kinda a good reason.  First off, I was in Georgia for a couple of days for my fam's annual vacation after school is out. We always go to the same hotel, The Cloister's in Sea Island, but this year it was a bit discombobulated.  First off, the hotel is currently undergoing reconstruction to build a new main building in order to get their five stars back. They lost their fifth one a couple of years ago and are pissed. From the looks of the grounds and the re-working they are doing, they want it back pretty bad.  Secondly, the G-8 conference was occuring at the exact same time as we were going there, so our hotel room was transfered to the other hotel on the same premises until the president and the other world leaders dispersed from the main grounds. Needless to say, the people of the town were a bit disrupted and most of the stores/restaurants lost tuns of business due to the high levels of security, but o well.  After the kerfuffle of the conference it was finally time to relax even though I couldn't not workout b/c of the recital I have in two days. I did however take in some long hours on the beach reading and tanning.  To find out how the whole tanning thing went, read the title of this post.   You see, I'm of Irish and English desent.Therefore, I am pale skinned with freckles. So, I fell asleep while by the ocean and wasn't aware that I was scorching my skin off of my shoulders untl I woke up an hour later and I could barely move. Talk to me in five years when I have skin cancer. Happy times.  Erik is in Salt Lake right now and I'm upset that he got disqualified from the nationals for the debate team. He was rather distraught when I talked to him and I was sad. Anyway, I hope he feels better later, and I told him to call. We kind of have calling system set up on a "need to know" basis. That works considering he is many miles away. I'm glad we kept in touch, though, because he is a good friend to have around. Even if he isn't always around.  So, my earlier post where I was talking about the fucked up phone message I left on Ryan's machine? Well, Mrs. Sextro, as I suspected was thoroughly entertained and therefore laughed much. She was confused as to why my mom needed to use the phone so urgently and I simply explained that everything is an emergency to my mom. Tis tru.  Then, I talked to Ryan online for a long time which was good. I needed to catch up anyway because we hadn't talked at all after I came back from Michigan and I was sad. Anyway, that was cool.   Tomorrow I get to sleep in and so tonight I have decided not to go to bed early as I normally would.   I know that was a random comment but o well.  I was just thinking about the Diary of Anne Frank. Well, in those times, the computer wasn't invented, so obviously blogging wasn't an option for her, and anyway, if it were, the Nazis would have been able to trace her over the internet anyway.... What I was getting at was that, fifty or so years from now, I wonder if there will be famous bloggers. You know, and like everyone will want to read their thoughts. But at the time, they really never thought of them as particularly inspiring anyway. I wonder if ever there was a person who realized their greatness when they were actually alive.  Food for thougt.  Be careful though.  I don't suggest trying to masticate with the computer.

      If you didn't figure it out from the title of this post, I'm in quite a good mood. I'm not exactly sure why, but I am.   I am excited because tomorrow I am heading down to Georga and I get to finally be in a bathing suit. If you know me well, I don't really like to wear coats in the winter and socks on my feet, so when I finally get to wear a bikini and lay out  in the sun I am very happy.   Ryans' sisters are having their dance recital today and I am really pissed that I can't see them. They are younger than I am but have been dancing for way longer and therefore could woop my ass in any competition. I left a message on their machine to wish them good luck, except my mom picked up the phone and began to talk to me even though I was telling her I was leaving a  message on someone's machine. When Mrs. Sextro picks up the messages later, she'll probably be either very confused or extremely entertained. Either way, I did eventually wish them luck and I know they'll do well. Ryan if you read this, let me know how it went.  So I have been thinking a lot about the camp I went to last summer. I literally lived away from my family for two months and I must say the freedom was amazing.  As much as I loved it there, there were many things which are keeping me from going back. There was this guy, of course a guy, but fuck it, I hate him and don't want to talk about him. Ryan knows, so, yeah. I hated myself for it for so long.   Then there was this assbitch director who hated my guts... don't want to talk about him either.  I left so many emotions there that I feel somehow like I'm really going to miss something this summer. I wont miss the food, becauseit was craptacular (Ryan I'm using your word.) I won't miss most of the people either, except for a select few, one of which I owe my life.  Still, at the end of the day, I love home. I love the people at my home, and I love my bf.  Things can change so quickly and it is amazing how one day, one choice can change a person's life.  I only have a few regrets and that's okay. But the funny thing is, the choices I've made the past year or so have been some of the best ones of my life. Even the bad ones have made me become a better person, especially the choices I made at a certain local boys school.  Its funny because I'm almost dreading the summer. In the fall, I thought I had so much time, and it's dwindled down to almost nothing.  I'm hoping weekends next school year will be good, and I have faith that they will be.   He'll be around.  Until next time I feel like having a bitch session or updating y'all on my drama.

      Okay, so here I am back from a semi-relaxing "vacation" at my summer home in Harbert, Michigan if you could call it a vacation. It was basically seven days where I could loaf around and do absolutely nothing. It was uneventful except for the fact that I found the most fantabulous purse at an antique shop I frequent and what was even more tanfastic was that it cost...wait for it......... 18 fucking dollars. Yes you heard...um.. read me. 18 dollas'.  WARNING: THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO READ ME POURING MY HEART OUT SHOULD SIGN OFF NOW.seriously. Now.  So, I was reading Ryan's blog and then I clicked over to Dan's blog, then to Billy's. I realized that I have absolutely no life. I am sitting at my computer on a sunday night and I have no one to talk to and no one to be out with. That wouldn't be such a bad thing, except nobody's gonna even read this blog so it won't matter anyway. I have lived my whole life waiting at home for something exciting to finally happen. And finally it did. Last year about the middle of february my life changed drastically. I did something that I really never thought I could do. I walked into a boys school and auditioned for a musical. The audition part was easy. Walking into the Emerson lobby at Desmet high school with all of those guys was not.   I was originally in it for just the experience of being in another show. Just to get more exerience with performing and being onstage which is a passion of mine, no more than a passion, a love. I am in love with being onstage. I love absolutely everything about it. I love the rehearsals when I am being yelled at by the bitchy but talented Zoe. I love how my feet bleed after being in character shoes for four hours straight trying to get the damn step down. I love that feeling of being backstage waiting for the curtain to open and to feel the lights shine down on the caked on make-up.I love it. And for a while, I thought thats all I would ever become. An impassioned girl who performed, and then a woman who performed, and then, of course, an old woman with nothing left but stale memories of musty curtains and callused feet, the scars of the hell I put them through.   Last year though, not only did I gain experience in the theater, I gained experience in people. I actually feel like last year I really lived. For the first time ever, I was a real person with real friends who really cared whether I had a crappy day, who cared whether I recieved an award or got another amazing part in a play which I'd always wanted. I found who I was at Desmet. And I met someone who has made me a better person.(you know who you are.)  The fact is, most of the people I developed a close relationship with were older. They are wonderful people who are so talented and so amazingly kind, even if it wasn't real. Thank you to those people who know who you are. I will never ever forget my experiences.  The fact that these people are leaving is very sad to me. They are moving on while I am staying behind with a handful of memories and a book full of photographs. I am heartbroken that these people who meant so much to me are moving on with their lives.  I've done this before you know. People move away and promises are made. Promise to write, to call, to email, to im. I value these promises with everything I posess. One such person,( again, you know who you are,) I have faith that they will keep in tough regularly. This is one I'm gonna try to make work. But those promises that you have made can always be broken. It makes me sad, but they are moving into happier places. Trust me, there are far better places to make your life than St. Louis.   Good luck to all of you, and know that you have made a profound difference in my life. I willnever forget you. (especially you.)  I'm scared.  I have faith but Im scared. Unfortunately I've become too good at saying goodbye. Goodbye and goodluck. may you be in heaven fifteen minutes before the devil knows you're there! (just a little irish blessing.)

      Hello everyone, again, one who reads my blog. I haven't posted in a long time. One would think that it would be because I was busy. In fact, this is not true. I am just lazy. Ah, lazy summer days.  Ryan is on vacation with his family in Florida now, and won't be back till the eleventh. At least I'll be able to see him again.  I've actually been online a lot talking with some friends. In particular, Paul, Dani's boyfriend who is a really good guy. I wanted to talk to him because I care about her and wanted to make sure he was on the up and up. Dani has done more for me than she should ever have done, and she takes on a lot of shit from other people that she doesn't need. I am grateful to her and admire her well.  I've actually been rather moody too. I was at camp, which is going well, by the way, and we were watching scenes from different musicals. Of course there was a clip from Sunday in the Park With George, and of course I broke down in front of the whole class, completely embarrassing myself. I hate being so weak that I can't even look at a reminder of last year's camp that I cry spontaniously.  Other than that, I've been hanging out at my pool, talking with friends.  At camp, we get to prepare a song, something we have never performed before and want to sing. I, of course, am singing On My Own from Les Miserables. I've always wanted to perform that song,and am so happy that I finally will. I am the perfect Eponine, really. But, then again, I am also Cosette. Oh well. Perhaps everyone is a bundle of ironies and contradictions. Thats what makes humans so complicated I guess.  I miss Ryan. It's going to be even harder than I thought next year. Talking to one of my other Desmet friends, I was asked if I was coming back to do the musical. I started thinking about going there next year, looking around at that amazing theater, looking at the curtains, seeing the stage, the green room, the couch. The chair. The water bottle... I just can't. The memories are too strong, and it wouldn't do the musical well to have an overemotional chemically imbalanced girl onstage when all she can think about is who isn't there, thinking of the musical we aren't doing. It would destroy me.  It's finally sunny outside. Maybe its clearing up for me too. The rain lasted a long time. I love the rain. It was pretty, but now I'm glad the sun is out, because the flowers are so much happier looking and their petals are so much brighter with the rays of the sun on them.  My favorite flower, it is funny,  is actually a rather humble plant. I like red geraniums. They aren't very pretty,and they can get a bit mealy,but they give me some kind of an inward joy looking at them. They make me smile, as if, behind all of their ordinariness, they have some inner secret that we can only guess at.  Happy Fourth of July, everyone. Have good times  Adieu.
