      Well it finally came... the day when I can finally write about what the major part of my life has been about. Darlene's surprise wedding shower was tonight at my place. For the last three weeks its been in the back of my mind with lists of things that needed to be done yet. Now don't get me wrong it was great but I'm glad to have it over so now I don't need to tell little fibs and worry that people won't show or have fun or be cranky with me. Here is a list of the things that I have learned: 1. Do it yourself (less stress) 2. Plan for people to eat more than they usually would 3. Women can chat for hours unless given direction 4. Even simple games can be quite amusing 5. Middle Age/Old people give the rudest gifts (sex kit, massage oil, sex game) 6. Your friends face when she walks in the door and sees everything is priceless and almost brings tears to your eyes  The shower went very well as far as I could tell. Darlene got TONS of great gifts and seemed to enjoy herself quite a bit and at the end of the day that's what counted. Well I'm going to try to get some sleep tonight since I didn't sleep at all last night.  xo

      I haven't posted in the last couple of days because I haven't known what to write. I keep trying to get out all my thoughts then giving up saying "I'll do it later that doesn't sound interesting enough" but its comments like that which make me very upset down the line. For example this week my friend Austin has been scanning photos of him, his bride to be and their friends...there are tons of pictures of my other friend and Darlene and/or Austin but there is not a single one of me and them. When I realised that I felt so crap and immediatly thought... Am I a crap friend? Am I really not as close to them as I think? Anyways I got really depressed about the whole thing. Now I know in my head that just because there are more pictures of them and Sandra that doesn't mean that they are better friends with her but whatever it was I got really upset (actually still am). So then I was thinking back on all my years being friends with them going why didn't I take pictures with them then.... or that time...etc and I've come the the conclusion that I take my photographs in my mind. Perhaps in hindsight I should be taking pictures to share but I much rather enjoy the moment than say "Smile for the camera" or think Hey! this would be a great picture I should take a shot of this. I wonder if this is a problem for others as well as just me cause it seems like all my friends are into pictures. I'm kicking myself now though cause everyone at the wedding who doesn't know Sandra or me are going to think wow she's a great friend look at all these photos she's in....and then in the back of a photo somewhere there will be my shadow it just makes me sad. (How pathetic I know.)  Another thing that is getting me down... the bridesmaid dresses are still not here! The wedding is in 12 days. The dresses should be here by Thursday but I'm getting really cross and stressed cause I haven't even tried on the dress so I have NO idea what it will look like on me. Along this note I still have NO idea how I'm doing my hair. It feels so unorganised and stuff.  On a good note though there is only 2 more sleeps till Oli is here. Although it adds to my stress cause he's meeting my family for the first time I'm looking forward to being back together its been very hard being apart...well at least for me. I can't wait to show him around Winnipeg and to go to Niagara Falls with him. Its going to be a good couple of friends.  Things that I have decided I'm going to work harder at: -my relationship -taking photographs -being organised

      Do you ever look at a blank calendar and think "Hey I'm not too busy" and then you look at the list of things that you haven't done and should have already? Well that's what happened to me today. I printed out a blank calender and gradually started filling in all the things and people I want/need to see before I leave. Well at the end of it Oli and I are only going to have about 3 slower days. Not that I'm complaining at all cause we are doing everything we want to do it just looks like a terrible schedule on paper.  One thing I learned today: I learned that it is almost impossible to be secretive in Winnipeg because people know everything about everyone.  One thing that I wish I did today but didn't: I wish I would have bought the other hair piece for the wedding.  One thing that I'm going to do tomorrow: Work on my portfolio for my UK teaching qualifications.

      Well I'm feeling a little better this morning although not much better. The pain in my legs is going away, the pain in my head is starting to go away until I move at least. Today's obstacles are my headache, and my sinuses. Woo hooo..... I've counted the amount of hours I slept yesterday and they totalled 26/30 hours. I'm not lazy but I was so sick. Oli gets to Winnipeg in just over a week. I miss him so much but its kinda weird cause he's going to have to meet my family.  Things I'm looking forward to this week: -Gelati with friends from Uni -Seeing Shannon -Going to Toronto on the 13th -Seeing Oli on the 11th -doing wedding stuff with Darlene, Austin and Sandra

       Friday    I drove to the cabin at about 3pm and when I say drove I mean at 140 kms/hour no one was going to catch me. I drove down with my uncle and sister both who proceeded to smoke joints right in front of me while I was driving. The 2 hour ride was very fast although we did stop several times for various things for the cabin. When we got there we unpacked the car and without hesitation grabbed our bathing suits and were down at the water. Well lets just say that it was the only thing I did quick that night... the water was freaking freezing. I did manage to get in a little swim but it was so cold I decided to call it a night.    Back to the cabin and off to an early night of bed.      Saturday   I woke up really early and started making breakfast for the 9 of  us that were at the cabin. Uncle woke up and started to help after awhile. At 11 I got my bathing suit on and my cousin and his friends drove out to the island in the middle of my lake for the Island Swim Race. The island is just over a mile from the beach. We had to get dropped off at the island and swim back to the beach. This year there were 6 of us doing it (I have done it 3 times before).  The person who won it did it in 20 mins. All I can say about that is WHAT A CRAZY NUT. I did it in 46 mins which gave me 3rd place.  After the race we took the boat back to the cabin and then went to play in the horseshoes tournament. I proceeded to throw tons of ringers and leaners but still managed to lose in the 2nd round by sheer luck for the other team. We threw a winning leaner but they threw a ringer over top and took it by 1 point. Oh well there is always next year.       Sunday   OH MY GOSH my body hurt!   Very little accomplished today. Spotted my cousins waterskiing and tubing in the neighbours Mastercraft. What a nice boat! My cousin's friend who i'm not particularily fond of went on the tube and nearly got killed but he held on...?!?! how?!?!      Monday   I can feel a cold coming on I still ache my leg hurts from tripping over the pullout bed last night. My sister and uncle are going home tonight in my car. Auntie Debbie,my little cousin Brandon and I went to Rainbow Falls. People were jumping off these falls into the water lower down.... I decided i wasn't going to jump instead I would go to the lower part and swim around...next thing i know i'm being pushed down the river and actually having a hard time stopping. Kept bumping parts of my body of the rough rocks hidden below. Why do people think this is fun?!So now i'm still aching from the island swim race, tripping and bruising my leg on the bed but now i'm bumped and bruised from these damn rocks. Debbie, Brandon and I went out for dinner at a local restaurant cause we couldn't be bothered to cook.       Tuesday   Well its official I'm dead to the world.    I'm so sick I can't get up I ache all over, I have a cold of some sorts, someone must have run over my head with their car or something. All I can do is sleep. Well what a weekend at least I won a trophy and got to go swimming. It was all worth it in the end but seriously if I find the person who gave me this cold I'll get even. I have a slight suspicion it was my uncle.
