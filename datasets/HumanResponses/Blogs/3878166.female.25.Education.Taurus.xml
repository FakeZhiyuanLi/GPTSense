      Marija&nbsp;is a girl I met last September when I started the Elementary Education Program. She majored in Biology and she decided to apply to the program when she realized she had the&nbsp;patience to work with people who didn't have&nbsp;a good grasp of English. She's originally from Serbia, and she carries an accent, that gives her international status away. She values a healthy diet, preferring organic foods to chemically treated ones. And for awhile she was a raw foodist and grew her own bean sprouts. Sometimes when she speaks to her boyfriend of 8 years in Serbian, it sounds like she is ordering her around. But that is just what Serbian sound like to me,&nbsp;because I am&nbsp;only well-versed in English and a little bit&nbsp;in Cantonese.&nbsp;When she speaks in English,&nbsp;she&nbsp;doesn't sound as firm, but it's still usually a more serious tone, even when she's&nbsp;joking.&nbsp;I have another friend who speaks in the same way, and it's really hard to tell when she's&nbsp;pulling&nbsp;my leg&nbsp;because her voice would never give her away.&nbsp;  I like hanging around with&nbsp;Marija because she's honest and trustworthy. Right now, I'm waiting for her to pick me up so that we can go bikini shopping. She hasn't found her dream suit yet.

      Some people sing. Some people dance. I journal. I always have, since a very young age. I'm 25 now. Something about having a copy of my thoughts. I like looking back and taking a look at how I've changed over the years. An introspective side I guess.  Besides journalling, I have a few other interests.   My husband and I have a wonderful thing. We were married last summer, and our relationship has not changed in the least bit since the day we met. It was an interesting story, which I can get into later. Right now he lives two and a half hours drive away, so I only see him on the weekends, but as of this December I will have finished school and will be able to be closer to him. My days are spent studying to be an elementary school teacher. Teaching has been one of my recent passions. I hope it will carry me through my working years. I am particularly fond of working one-on-one with children who need that extra support and encouragement to learn.   I'm not a social butterfly. As many personality tests have indicated, I prefer to have one or two close friends. I talk with my sister, and have a few good friends who I met during my elementary education program. Myers-Briggs has me down as an INTP, but that was a few years ago.. I may have changed a bit since.   I have been told that I am honest. I would like to think so. There is nothing I hate more than fake behaviour. I would like to think that I am a good listener.  My philosophy on life reflects my introspective side in that I am on a quest to "know myself". In general, I don't hold many strong political opinions on today's matters. For the most part, it's because I don't feel like I know enough to form a decision, and I feel that unless I am informed, I would rather sit on the fence than have to pick a side and not be able to defend it solidly. I do hold strong feelings about good parenting though, as I intend to be a parent in the next few years. I think it's a real shame when kids suffer at the parent's expense.  How's that for an intro?

      So, all day now, my running commentary with myself has been focussed on this one phrase from the novel that I just finished reading. The novel is  The Watsons go to Birmingham - 1963  by Christopher Paul Curtis. It's about an African American family from Flint, Michigan, and the story moves from the eyes of Kenneth, a ten-year-old boy. Anyways, once they reach&nbsp;in Birmingham, Alabama, they meet their Grandmother. In this chapter, the grandmother is warning them not to go swim at Collier's Landing, because there are whirlpools there, and young children have died there. Kenneth doesn't trust his grandmother, especially since he doesn't even know what a "wool pooh" is. He's not used to the deep Southern accent.&nbsp;His older brother explains that a "wool pooh" is Winnie-the-Pooh's evil twin brother. Unafraid, Kenneth goes in the water, and gets caught by the "wool pooh" until his older brother save him.  &nbsp; And so, all day, I've been muttering "wool pooh" under my breath for amusement.

      Well, I guess I would be considered a good student. I get good grades. I attend classes until I'm so bogged down with assignments that class time takes away from homework time. I take notes, listen in class, and try not to daydream. I think it's normal for even a good student to fall asleep in class sometimes.   But here's what's been bothering me. Since I've entered the Post Degree Program in Elementary Education, my grades have significantly improved. I realize this isn't anything I should be bothered about, but this is just an example of how I am, sometimes. Basically, I've become&nbsp;suspicious as to whether my effort&nbsp;in school has&nbsp;correlation to my grades. Dare I suggest that the teachers are being too lenient? Could they be giving me good grades I don't even deserve? My first theory is that, perhaps, I have learned to&nbsp;work more effectively. Me? The procrastinator? Let me stress, that my work habits have not changed!   This summer semester, I've been&nbsp;taking 3 courses, which means 6 hours of classes consecutively from 8:30-2:30. I&nbsp;chose not to buy the required text books because it didn't seem likely that I would read them. It's summer, com'on! Regardless of having no text book knowledge, I have gotten A's on my last papers,&nbsp;and&nbsp;80% on a test.. (which I am a bit disappointed about, but considering that I studied for less than an hour, perhaps 80% is quite respectable). I'm confused because if the low-effort I am putting in earns me an A, then how much harder does one work to get an A+ (which in my opinion, is nearly impossible to obtain)? Could it be, that more&nbsp;people than I realize are getting A+'s?&nbsp;   My second theory is that because entrance into the education program was based solely on GPA, this meant that anyone who got in was the "cream of the crop". Our proffesors know this, so perhaps, they are giving&nbsp;me top-notch marks because they know&nbsp;I am a top-notch student, and they are just perpetuating that despite that I barely got into the program, and wasn't an A student to begin with! I was probably more of a B+/A- student before entering the program. I am assuming that many of my colleagues attest to being A/A+ students. But, maybe I am wrong, and they were ALL B+/A- students, like myself...   A&nbsp;final theory&nbsp;is that I may be doing better because my previous years in university has taught me how to jump the hoops.&nbsp;I've learned to jump so well now, that I can't earn anything LESS than an A. What have I learned? Well,&nbsp;when you write a paper, ANY PAPER, you must 1) have a really entertaining intro 2)be concise 3)include either your experience, or how you think the topic would affect you personally (no matter how contrived it is) 4) and make some insightful comment on future research (that makes it sound like you just discovered what you want to do your Masters on.) and 5) make sure you know your APA or MLA format. Nothing shows you are an "average" student like setting up margins wrong. 6) And proof-read. I proof-read some of the time... but when I don't, I always get the comments that tell me I should. Even if the body of your paper is just miminally relevant, you will get nothing short of an A. So in essense, a research paper is very little research. In the case where I don't proof read, I might get an A-.   So maybe what my papers have been missing.&nbsp;I need more guts and I need to remember to proof-read. Interesting thoughts. Well, I've got a paper to do, I'll report on how well it goes later. haha. Rate my rant. I like how I numbered my theories.

      Maddy is my tabby cat. She is mostly white, has a mask of brown and black over one eye, a heavy patch of brown and black over her back, and a dark tail. Her belly is soft and white except for one small smudge of brown. I find the smudge charming.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Her and I are quite alike. You know how they say pets and their owners are alike? Maddy and I are an example of this.&nbsp;Maddy likes&nbsp;her alone time. She also likes to be touched, but only on her own terms. Sometimes she will climb onto my computer chair from the back and then slide herself into my lap, demanding attention and affection. If need be, she will get up and stand infront of the computer screen. I pet her and push her down into my lap so that I can surf the net and keep her happy.  &nbsp;  I love to accost Husband when he is watching tv on the couch. When he sits there with that blank look on his face, it tells me he could use a big hug. Am I wrong? I sneak up to the side of him, and quickly slip into a straddle position, clipping my arms around his neck and pressing my body into his. Then I smile. If he doesn't put his arms around me, I will prompt him verbally, "hug me!" or physically, by lifting his heavy arms onto my back. Whatever it takes, I will do it. I try not to stick my head in his line of the television or kiss him though, because I know that he will start to pull my body off of him, (and he often succeeds after a few tries). But afterwards, he&nbsp;usually gives in to my request of a "good hug and a good kiss" which negatively reforces him of his tv time back. The criteria of a "good hug and a kiss" is a good  solid  hug, and a kiss that lasts for atleast 3 seconds. And he can't just stick his lips out like a duck. He's got to show some love.  &nbsp;  That's about it. We're brats. We get our way. And there's nothing else to it.  &nbsp;  Lately, I have noticed that&nbsp;Maddy is more affectionate after she's had her catnip. When we shake the container around her, she gets excited and stressed at the same time.   Put a bottle of Baileys in front of me and guess what happens? &nbsp;  Of course, there are times when Maddy would prefer not like to be touched. Her nickname is "Miss Backer-Upper" at these times&nbsp;because&nbsp;she just ducks down and scoots away backwards when you reach for her. She'll also arch her back under so that your hand can barely brush her fur.   I don't find myself in those kind of situations often, but the other day when Husband and I were at Sears looking at refrigerators and the salesguy gave Husband his business card and then put his arm on my shoulder for a second to say thanks for&nbsp;coming. I was wearing a spaghetti strap tanktop and really did not appreciate skin contact with anyone other than my Husband. I&nbsp;growled inside&nbsp;glared at him disapprovingly. It would have been much funnier if I had shrank away.&nbsp;  Nothing to conclude here. Just some tidbits.

      Solitary confinement has been ok. It seems that whenever I am around Husband, I start to become whiny or naggy. Is it normal for married people to evaluate their happiness? I do. I think back to when the last time I felt really happy was. (That was when I was over at a friend's house and we were making cheesecake together.) I think about times when I was really NOT happy. (That was some years ago when I was with my ex who would constantly criticize - or be verbally abusive- when I did something that went against his ideas. Being called "useless" really hurt, and it broke me down as a person.) These days, I am pretty blah because I'm not really doing anything to make myself happy. I have made tentative plans to start a belly dancing class - for fun- starting this September, but that still leaves me some time before that begins. If I do nothing with myself, I will have nothing to look back on. I think I'll create a list of healthy things for me to do so that I can have more happiness in life. (healthy refers to nondestructive activities like boozing...) And before I make my list, I should say that it's not that I'm unhappy with any part of my life,  I feel that I'm just not spending enough time on myself these days to really be introspective.  List of things to do that makeme happy 1. Go for a walk (that is sooo easy to do!) 2. Help someone out! 3. Read a good book 4. Go shopping!  Things not to do 1. Watch tv or spend too much time on the internet (or Minesweeper) 2. Sulk and whine to Husband about random things 3. Blame Husband for my boredom 4. Sleep during the day  Ok. Husband had a suggestion for me. he said that I should just tell my mother how much I hate her, and just be done with it, so that I don't get all grumbly whenever a situation comes up where I might need to speak with her. I am really considering this. I just have to overcome this fear of breaking her heart. I mean, honestly, it's not like she's soo oblivious to my repulsion to her.  And maybe after that last email, it would be a good idea. But how does one go about doing this? There probably isn't an easy way. I just want some suggestions... or encouragement... or discouragement! I dunno. It would be good to get things out in the open. Then I could just tell her she was being annoying again. I think she's actually hinted that she's wanted to know. Part of me almost doesn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing since she gets to drive me up the wall all the time. :P grrr. She is just so argh.

      Sometimes everything will get on my nerves. At those times the best solution seems to be solitary confinement. I have yet to find out what factor(s) lead me to feel agitated.  I still have yet to answer my mother's email.  Hi (Daughter), If I asked you if you still loved me ... You probably would not say no ....Maybe you'll say yes but with much frustration. So the question is why would you still love me?    (Please don't respond until you've finished your finals and papers ...I would really like you to put time into doing your school stuff first) love,  urlLink m@m   I actually don't think I love my mother. Not very much anyways. I would stand up for her, like I would stand up for any Joe Blow on the street, but not really because she's my mother or that I love her. Love is an interesting thing for me. I don't think I am able to love a lot of things/people etc. I spose part of the reason is that I am incapable of accepting people for who they are a lot of the times. I have expectations, that I obviously feel are important. I love my husband (I think), I love my sister (definitely), and I love my cats!  Funny that I would love my cats, but they just seem to make life easy for me. I think love is conditional on that. If you want to have me love you, you have to make life easier for me somehow. My cats do this by providing comfort, attention, affection, companionship, and happiness. I'd like to think that I can provide those things for my cats too, and that the relationship is reciprocal. So yes, that's why I love my cats. Their personalities are cute, not always lovable, but that doesn't change me from loving them.  I love my sister because she tries hard to understand me, and she often succeeds in understanding me because we share so much of our history. We support each other in a sensitive and sincere manner. We are unselfish towards each other. We like to do things with each other. We are similar in many ways, and also different in many ways, but we respect each other, no matter what! So that is why I love her.  I love my Husband because he has shown belief in me as a good person, as wife material, mate material, and life partner material. Moreso, he accepts me for who I am, and I accept him for who he is. He is patient, kind, loving, and he does that because he love me. He gives me special treatment, and is nonjudgemental when it comes to me. haha.  But my mother... isn't good at communicating, doesn't help me financially, is disapproving, and appears insincere. Sure, she carried me for nine months, and she worked hard to provide that a nanny was there to take care of me, but in essence, she does little to meet my expectations of a parent.  On the other hand, my Husband's mother is very pleasant, she is open, generous, helpful, honest, diplomatic, and true to herself. She cares, and behaves caringly. It's really that simple.  So whatever. My mother pisses me off, and does things that piss me off. I can make a list perhaps. She wouldn't let me invite my nanny to my wedding. She nags me to call my grandmother even though I have made it clear that I don't want to. She asks about my dad's family even when I've told her time and again that it pisses me off, especially when she asks about them before she even asks about MY life. It sends a clear message to me what her priorities are. When I am coming into town, she won't do anything special, like take us out for dinner. When she says she wants to buy me something, it's on her own agenda, like the time she said she wanted to take me shopping, and it was really so that she could take advantage of the "buy one get one free/half price" deal, so she wouldn't feel guilty for making a large purchase. She STARES at me, and even after I told her it bothers me she said she couldn't help it. I would have appreciated that she made an effort as to not make me uncomfortable, but she did not make any concessions. I could probably go on, it doesn't take me too long before another example pops into my head..  So, why do I love her? Apparently she assumes in the email that I do? Or is she feeling depressed and worthless because she feels as though she doesn't deserve the love of her daughter. If she is feeling that, then she is probably accurate. I can't just love someone because they are my mother. I might be thankful.. but I mean, if I can't feel entitled to be born then I shouldn't be allowed to live right? lol. I hope I didn't dig myself into a hole there! I just need some real reasons. A lot of people give birth to children. What makes her different?
