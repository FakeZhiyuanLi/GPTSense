      :D  Here's a list of comics I picked up today.    1.  Astonishing X-men #1 Director's Cut   where Director's Cut = Rip off 2.  Astonishing X-men #2 3.  Mystique #16 4.  Superman #206  Jim Lee what happened?  what is this garbage? 5.  Wanted #4  Bout fkn time.  Better be worth the wait. 6.  Robin #127  Ok the New Robin gimmick is done, i want to see a good story now. 7.  The Flash #211  So Awsome! Geoff Johns is doin great shit with the series.  I still like the Waid run better.   8.  Teen Titans #12  Another Johns book.  Its been goin great and McKone is an amazing artist 9.  Excalibur #2  Wow.  The Magneto situation is fked up.  Evidently the Magneto at the end of Morrison's run (Planet X) wasn't the real Magneto.  Damn they didn't waste any time bringing him back.  Not just him but Xorn as well.  It ticked me off seeing this happen but Claremont is handling it well.  Magneto comes back is like "Oh come on you know I don't act like that and I could never do those things" and we're all like "shit he's fkn right! How the fk did I fall for that?"  Eventhough I believe Morrison meant for that to be the real Magneto.  I also got a Previews and the smaller Marvel Previews.  If I have more time during this week I'll put reviews for each.  Anythoughts above are just from skimming through the issues.

           Paul M. Johnson Jr was beheaded.  I pray for him and his family.         Today was kind of uneventful.  I worked the overnight as usual 11 - 7:30 a.m.  My friend T called me up asking to go to a job interview with him.  It was for a low level job in a labratory.  I basically sat in an office for an hour with some drawings I did back in 2000.  I had forgotten about them and it was cool to see how much I've grown artistically.  After that it was around lunch time so we stopped by Blimpies and Circuit City.  Hung out afterwards playing the awsome Chronicles of Riddick for Xbox.         I've been checking the Dc forum hoping to have gotten some kind of response to the short story I posted but I got nutt'n.  O well.  I'm enjoying it and T gave it a thumbs up so that's good enough for me.  I hope my little sister likes it.  I gave her a link but haven't heard anything from her.  She's never been into comics but I lent her the Tpb's of Y and she loved it.  So now I pick up the issues for myself and the tpbs for her, then I pass them on to whoever is interested.    ookokok I'm tired.  Working tonight :/    Doonin OUT!

      This is a fanfic for Y the Last Man I am working on.  I also posted this on the DC Y Message Boards.  Ok this may be long.  You've been warned.  I started by imagining a Mrs. Magoo.  Now toss her into the Y verse.  So what follows is a story I was brainstorming while working the overnight.  I was actually laughing to myself.  I am going on 36 hrs no sleep.       Here is the situation with our group at the beginning of this tale.  After Widow's Pass Yorick and 355 have started hanging out together more and distancing themselves from Dr. Mann.  Unintentionally of course, but they often find themselves chatting and laughing then have to stop to ask, "Hea, where's Docter Mann?", only to find her inspecting something that is more to her interests or stopping for rest.  They are walking along a highway somewhere in the "plains" states where there are no mountains so the wind is fierce.  They come across abandoned farms but they feel as if they are many hours apart.  When ever they make it to one of these sanctionaries they stock up and move out.   There we are.  Now I begin.       They come up to a small farm.  The trackters and equipment outside are rusted as if it is another abandoned farm except there is a lush garden with vegetables nearby which had to have been maintaned. They had run out of food a day ago and they were all starving.  355 has to stop Yorick from raiding the garden.  "What are you doing?! There's obviously someone livin' here and I think it'd be kind of rude to just tear into their crop.  Let's just find whoever's livin' here and ask politely."  Yorick:   "arg, fine I'm goin to take a piss.  No peeking." smiling  355:  "Nigga pls.  I've seen it all and done it all.  As a matter of fact I'll be all the way over there just so you don't even have to look over your shoulder thinkin there is even a hair of a chance I'd try to look. You can piss peacefully punk." smiling back       355 and Dr. Mann walk off yelling "Hello?" "Anybody Home?".  Dr. Mann mentions hoping to find a television or radio to see if some kind of communications has been reestablished.       Yorick wanders off looking for a spot, stomach growling from hunger.  He finds a thin tree.  He lifts his right leg immitating a dog peeing and looks over his shoulder smiling.  No one is around.   He frowns and puts his leg down and gets to buisness.  Seconds after he starts chickens start roaming around him.      "Aw no way!  Sh*t!  You terds better not try anything stupid.  That's the fate of the world right there and I'll be damned if.."                      "Here chick chick chick chick"            The chickens start flapping madly dangerously close to Yoricks legs and he hops onto his toes while zipping up.  As he looks up he sees a carving of a heart with Jeb and Barb inside of it on the tree.  An old woman is walking towards him, bent over, petting at thin air.  "Here chick chick chick chick chi..."  Yorick:  "Oh Hi sorry I really had to go and.."     Yorick freezes because the woman's hand is touching him near his crotch.  There is a piss stain.  Her hand rises up to his face and she is feeling his face.  Yorick's face is kind of disgusted because the stench of the piss on her hand is unbearable.  She feels around his face.  "Jeb? Jebdia?  Where the hell you been son?  We been waitin for ya ever since you ran off with that girl of yours to get married.  How was that thing anyways? What'd ya call it?  WoolStock?"  During this dialoge she is smiling and pinching Yorick's cheeks and hugging him.  She stops at the end and her jaw drops in shock.  "Oh Pa's gonna have a talk with you.  He was talk'n bout ripp'n you a new one next time he saw ya.  He's inside come on.  I'll git Dinner up."   Yorick:  "Pa?" face shocked           "Dinner." smiling            "No wait lady look..." angry  Old Woman:  "What!"        she snatches Yorick by his ear and yanks him dragging him towards the main house.  Yorick:  "ow ow ow ow"              "The hell you think you are back talking boy? Git inside."  Yorick:  "355!! Dr. Mann!!! Anybody !! Help!"       355 and Dr. Mann run over stopping them before they reach the house.  355:  "Hi I'm.."          They stop, taking in the fact that Yorick is bent over being dragged by his ear by this old woman. They have the "WTH?" face.  Yorick does the "I don't fkn know!" shrug.  Old Woman:   "LaWanda! What ya doin here? We let you go years ago."             Closeup of  355''s pissed off face.  The old woman moves towards her to hug her letting go of Yorick.  He quickly starts gesturing to 355 to calm down by putting up his palms.            "You brought my baby back to me didn't cha!  I got something for ya."             She pulls out some change.  355 reaches for her gun under her jacker.  Yorick jumps in while Dr. Mann is smiling with her finger to her cheek watching this scene play out.             Yorick:    "Yea  ma LaWanda  ..umm...done picked me up at the .."       she pushes Yorick out of the way             Old Woman:   "What's that ya got there?  Ya brought me sutt'n LaWanda! Aw ya shouldn't have."       She reaches into 355 jacket and pulls out candybars, twinkies, and chips.             "You shoulda known better than that.  You know I don't eat that junk.  How am I supposed to keep the teeth I got eat'n that junk?  The hell wrong with you?"       Yorick and Dr. Mann throw pissed off faces at 355 while she throws back an eyebrow raised "sorry don't kill me" smile.

      My sister moved back out after one week. I work overnight so I sleep during the after noon usually. I was alseep when it happened, but my sisters got into some kind of arguement and Elise said fk this I'm not going to take your shit and just moved back in with her "boyfriend?" I still see them everyday because GIGI, her daughter, goes to a daycare that is five minutes from here so we pick her up and then later in the evening Elise picks her up.     I am working on a project that deals with the Iraqi war. My friend Carlos came back from Iraq a couple months ago and he had a few stories. I interviewed him with a tape recorder and now I'm going to try to put it into some kind of story format with artwork. I thought about making it into a comic book styled book only with his narration instead of dialogue. Another idea is a Children's book format, where his story is printed out like a normal book with sections left black for art work that describes certain paragraphs. I don't want to dramatize his story or make it like Saving Private Ryan where its a tale based on actual events. I want his words to be the narration with my artwork simply reenforcing his words. I am goin to type out the interview soon.    I finished my work on the Indiana Jones project over at  urlLink Pencil Jack   All the actual artwork is done we just need colorists and letterers to finish it up. I drew pages 3 and 8 and inked pages 1 and 3. I have offered to color a page because right now no one has offered to. I don't want the project to be scrapped just because its not colored. I suck at colors tho :/    I also joined the Iron Man vs the Zombie Jedi project. They have been having trouble getting artists to join up. They had a deadline for a page yesterday that wasn't met and today they have a deadline for 2 pages to be handed in. One artist has said he'll be able to hand in his page today, but there has been no word from the other 2 artists. Now the project is in danger of being scrapped.     .........

      My sister had moved out with her 2 daughters to live with her boyfriend's family but she's back. They are split up. My younger sis's one of my best friends and her kids are practically my own so its cool they are back home. She said she went out over the weekend with him and he was burping and farting in public. She asked him to relax or something and he was like "Look this is me". She  said "Is this the kind of person I want to spend the rest of my life with?"     Its crowded here now and there is always a little kid crying or screaming. Personally I don't mind it but my mom freaks out and so do my sisters and I find the way they react more annoying than the actual kids. They start screaming "get me a bottle!, don't touch that!, there's no more pampers!" Every fucking thing they feel they have to scream louder than the kid.     I am inking my Indiana Jones page right now. Inking sucks. I don't have the patience for it. Also you have to be very careful and be able to hold your hand steady. I am very energetic when I draw and its like hitt'n the breaks when I have to ink. O well. I want to see this project completed already so I have to get it done. Hopefully by this weekend. I have to be careful because of the babies running around. I can't leave markers, pens or pencils out in the open or they'll grab 'em and write up on anything they find.    My job messed up on the payroll so I didn't get a check this week. No biggie, I'm just scrounging up change so I can eat at work. Luckily I filled up my gas tank at the end of last week. I'm surviving on Ramen noodle.     ok goin to hit the drawing table.  For a great game check out http://natural-selection.org  I play that at least once a day.  Very Addicting.    hasta la pasta

           My local comic shop has a 50% off back issue sale going on.  I was flipping through alot of back issues, not sure what I should get, when I decided I'll check out the silver age section.  Not this section has like the first issue of Avengers, Fantastic Four, Spidey etc.  On the top of a stack of comics under a table there were some big oversized comics that looked kind of old.  I picked them up to check them out and they were Treasury Editions of alot of comics.  I thought they were going to be worth alot of money but when I asked the guy how much they were he said $2.50 with the discount.  I picked up 6 of them.    1.  Conan #15   art by Barry Windsor Smith, Jon Buscema, Gil Kane, Neal Adams  2.  Fantastic Four #2  reprints Galactus' first appearence as well as the Silver Surfer  3.  Fantastic Four #11  More reprints with Frightful Four also more amazing Kirby art.  4.  Thor #3  reprints Thor versus Hercules  More Kirby art.  That is the main reason I picked up alot of these.  5.  Avengers #7  reprints first appearence of Vision.  Jon Buscema art!!  6.  Batman #1  Its Batman, Robin, and Joker's first appearence reprinted, I had to get it.  I have a newfound respect for these artists.  Their art looks amazing in this oversized format.  I wish more of todays comics could be reprinted in a similar format.  Ultimates is something I'd like to see done this way.  On a side note, I passed by the comic shop today.  They had put out some more of these oversized books and I was going to buy more.  I was going to pick up one that reprinted JLA stories from the silver age as well as another one that reprinted the first appearence of the first FLASH! One of my favorite characters! But there was a different guy at the register today.  As soon as I put them on the counter he said "You know those are ten bucks each?" to which I said "oh yea so with the discount they're $5 right?"  He said "NO.  Regular price is $20"  I was kind of pissed but didn't say anything.  I just put them back.  I'm goin to keep passing by the store tho hoping that same guy who was at the register that other time will be there.

      2    X-Statix #24            Wow.  You have to see this issue to believe it.  Mr. Sensitive vs. Iron Man.  The battle begins like a normal superhero fight.  Basically 2 super strong types destroying their surroundings while brawling.  They are both after a piece of Doop's brain. (Long story).  The piece of brain just happens to be in the possesion of "The Church of the Naked Truth", and by naked they mean NAKED.  The leader will only discuss the matter if our heroes are unclothed.  So now they fight but instead of trading fists they tap each other.  Without his suit, a tap is like a punch to Mr. Sensitive.  But he is so sensititive he can pinpoint pressure points on Tony Stark's body.  This issue is like nothing I've seen before and really fun.  The art is handled by Mike Allred who is a master.  3     Ultimate X-men #48                           I have to start by talking about how the book feels.  It feels heavier and thicker than the other comics.  I think this goes for all the Ultimate books.  Really slick.                         This issue is what I've been waiting for.  When Brian K. Vaughan jumped onboard this book I really had no idea how it was going to be.  The first couple issues where kind o f just beginning this tale with nothing really big happening except for the introduction of Sinister.  This issue is where the shit happens.  I don't want to ruin it too much for anyone who hasn't read it.  The action was great and the play between the X-men was very well done.  "Apocalypse" also makes an appearence.  Sinister has become a whole lot more interesting with this issue.  He kind of reminds me of the Red Dragon from the Hannibal prequel.  Another great "OH SHIT" cliffhanger ending from BKV. Brando's art was perfect.  Can't wait for the next issue.  I also picked up a Wizard which is just wizard ya know.  It hasn't been the Magazine I really hunt down anymore.  With the internet all the current events is published right away.    I wish it came with some unique stuff like exclusive preview pages or sketch book sections.  okokok 'nuff typ'n  It was cooh Deun

      Second!Comics  that I picked up this week.       1.  Green Lantern #178  I jumped back onboard as soon as Ron Marz started writing this book again.  I had a few Hal Jordan GL issues but I really got into it right around the time Hal went bonkers killing the entire corps.  I welcomed Kyle Ryner and followed his adventures through many issues.  When Marz left the book originally I dropped it.  This storyline he has going now is leading up to the reintroduction of Hal Jordan as GL.  Kyle is getting shit on in it tho.  I like the way Marz is writing it (dialoge and pacing) but it really sux to have all these negative things happen to Kyle within the last couple issues.                The art great in this book.  I remember when Luke Ross was just a J. Scott Campbell imitator.  He has a really clean yet detailed style.  When I was skimming through his first issue on GL I thought it was Jeff Johnson at first.  Also in this particular issue, #178, the detail on  the Naval Carrier and fighter jets is insane.  Right up there with Hitch's Ultimates stuff.  I think if I would have read that in the script I would have shit myself.  If only the story was more positive.  Hopefully Ross will be the regular artist when GL relaunches with Hal if DC goes that route.

      Shaved today and I feel like a little kid now.  People have told me I look like I'm 15 yrs old when I'm clean shaven.  I hope not.  I'm goin to be job hunting soon so I figured I'd clean up a bit.  Working overnights you tend to neglect shaving since there is no dress code.  That doesn't mean I can go to work naked or anything but ... ya know .. we all wear clothes that are beat up with holes and stains because we usually get very dirty in our line of work.  O well check out the baby face..            Cheddacheesepleez Deun/Dan

           I've been keeping busy.  I don't know why but I've been feeling real good lately.  I always try to have a positive attitude but lately its like I just wake up smiling.  It feels like I'm in love but without a chick :).  Ya know when your in love how fkn dumb you get all smiling and happy.  I don't know what's up.  I not doing drugs or anything lol.  O well it feels good so fk it.      I have 3 days off from work this week!! in a row!!.  I've been drawing like a mutha and catching up with different projects I am working on.  I've been looking into my insurance plan from my job and I think I may be able to get that lazer surgery for my eyes.  Right now I have contacts but if I could get that surgery that would be so awsome.  I'm also looking into getting a camera cell phone. Woohoo!       A lady honked at me yesterday too!! I was cutting the grass out front all sweating and shit and a woman honked.  I looked up to see if it was someone I knew but it was just a cute girl smiling.  I know it might seem like nothing to you guys but me I barely see chicks around here.  I work overnight so I'm working with a bunch of 40 yr old guys and the only females around are the 40 yr old cashiers.  When I get out of work at around 7 am  the only people awake at that time are the senior citizens.  Now my job is very physically demanding so when I get out I'm still pumped and cannot go to sleep.  I end up sleeping in the afternoon, waking up just in time to get to work at 11 p m.  I'm not into malls and I don't know this area of Jersey well enough to find cool hang out places so having a girl honk at me was a big thing.  I've been so wrapped up with work, taking care of my family(Mom, sis's, bro, nephew, nieces) and trying to get a good portfolio going of my art, that finding a girlfriend has been in the very back of my mind.  Yea it gets lonely but I have faith the right girl will pop up.    Have fun Eva Ree Bod EE  Enjoy the beautiful weather  Deun/Danny
