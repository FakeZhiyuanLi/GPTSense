      Love starts with a smile grows with a kiss, and ends with a tears. Don't cry over anyone, who won't cry over you. If  love isn't a game, why are there so many players? Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave and impossible to forget. The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love, love somebody else. Life's short. If you don't look around once in a while you might miss it. A best friend is  like a leaf clover, hard to find  and lucky to have. Best friends are the siblings God forgot to give us. When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look ahead, you can look beside you and your best friend will be there. True friendship never ends. friends are forever. Good friends are like stars.... you don't always see them, but you know they are always there. Don't frown;you never know who is falling in love with your smile. What do you do when the only person who can make you stop crying is the person who made you cry? nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them. everything is okay in the end. If  it's not okay then it's not the end. most people walk in and out of you life, but only friends leave footprints in your heart

       urlLink    Driving along the winding roads to escape the steamy heat of Jeddah or entering from the east away from the dry desert clime of the Najd, visitors to Taif are greeted by a fresh, cool breeze as they ascend to the city. Set in a hollow between granite hills rising from the eastern slope of the Hejaz in the southwest region of the Kingdom, this city is a magnet that draws visitors from across Saudi Arabia.  The name Taif means encompassing in Arabic, and for centuries visitors to this mountain city 5,600 feet above sea level have enjoyed the captivating views from wind-sculpted rocks, a pleasant climate and the verdant setting of its surroundings, as well as the abundance of fruits which grow in its fertile valley. Fragrant roses, lush parks, sunny skies and exotic birds and wildlife have for generations drawn families to this resort town each summer. Not only is Taif popular among vacationers, but it has become the official summer seat of the Saudi government.  Numerous ruins and antiquities confirm Taifs colorful history which dates back to pre-Islamic times. Some historians believe the valley was settled over 5,000 years ago. The Banu Mihlahil, a vanished tribe, once inhabited this area, as did the Amalekites and the Thamud, also now disappeared. Other tribes, such as the Banu Thaqif, have survived. This largely settled tribe of farmers inhabited the walled city and resisted invasion by other tribes. They were wise traders, profiting from the caravans that passed through the region, selling them their produce and making protection and other services available to these travelers.

        There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! Hope that u dream of that special someone. Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tears.. Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you. A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let it go.....
