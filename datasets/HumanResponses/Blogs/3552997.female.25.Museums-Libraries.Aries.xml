      First off, I apologize on behalf of Garrett and myself for being oh so negligent in our blog updating.  So here’s a quickie to keep you satisfied…  After leaving Santa Fe we headed over to AZ to stay with Hil’s cousin Jada in Scottsdale.  Long story short, Jada and Erik (Hil’s high school buddy) are wonderful! Jada treated Hil, Erik and I to a fabulous dinner at Roy’s, the restaurant she works at. But Jada…just how did Mark find out I puked buckets of red wine outside in the nice shrubbery, hmmm?!??!  The next day we headed to Erik’s beautiful house for some pool, grill, and kegerator time…although I, of course, was most enamored of the dog…give Lobo a big kiss for me!  Many thanks to Jada and Erik…we WILL be back!  We continued on to Sedona…man that place is trippy…and Flagstaff.  Please note this was the first time we met up with the P-Kings, as we are not groupies.  Flagstaff was cool…we stayed in a haunted hotel in the Jack Daniels suite (although I was still being haunted by the red wine), and it was Hil’s turn to get her party on that night.   Day 10 had us off to the Grand Canyon…I won’t go into detail here except to say a man farted in Garrett’s face. ‘Nuff said. Then…Vegas!  I am fuzzy on the Vegas details..although I distinctly remember entering a 40 person hold ‘em tourney and placing one out of the money.  Much to Brent’s relief, I managed to hold back my nervous tears that were threatening to spill out before it started.  (Hillary here - Kate BEAT Brent by the way!! For those of you who know Brent and poker, you will understand how kick-ass this really is.)  From Vegas to Santa Barbara...I'll let Hil take over here...  Love you all---Kate  ....Hi everyone!  As Kate said, we are very sorry for not keeping up with the blog.  While I would like to blame lack of Internet access, the main reason is that we are just having so much fun that it's been hard to jusitfy sitting in front of the computer.  However, today finds us in an adorable little cafe in Eureka (!), CA, where we are sipping the Blast Off Blend - guaranteed to have more caffeine than any other coffee - woo hoo!!  OK, where were we?  Yes, Vegas to Santa Barbara.  We stayed with Brent's (for those of you who don't know who Brent is: he is a cool dude and Jesse's brother.  Jesse is a Patioking and Brent is touring with them doing the merch thang) friends, Marin and Robin, who are now in lovely Panama with my red cowboy hat.  Long story which I'll tell people later.  Santa Barbara was BEAUTIFUL!!  I actually body surfed if you can believe it - oh yeah, and got hit really hard in the butt with a frisbee.  Many thanks to Marin and Robin for letting us crash for two days at your house...now that we're moving to Napa Valley, we will see you soon I'm sure.  Which leads me to the next fabulous part of our trip, which was NOT San Francisco.  We were so wiped in San Fran - there is just nothing to note except we saw the P-Kings play there, which was cool as usual.  Oh yeah!  I had a job interview on Tuesday via phone, which I believe went really well - I should know by the end of the week if I will be the next Reference Librarian at Jones Library in Amherst.  Keep your fingers crossed...  Did I say we were moving to Napa Valley?  Yep, 'fraid so.  Kate had what may have been her best idea on this trip: stop at the Robert Mondavi winery for a bit of medicinal wine and a tour of the winery.  Our tour guide, Ralph, was hilarious - and, um, very generous.  We left with a free bottle of Merlot and an adorable map of the area.  By the way, Ralph: we didn't stay in Calistoga, but we did eat at the brewery, which was absolutely fab.  We had to keep driving, though, and while we would have loved to stay in Mendocino (population 800), believe it or not, there were no hotels in sight.  So we drove on to Fort Bragg.    And there you have it, folks!  Now you're caught up.  We will be hitting the Redwoods today - then onto Oregon, where we'll catch up with the P-Kings in Portland.  To all my friends on the West coast, I CANNOT wait to see you.  Please check out the Patiokings' web site (www.patiokings.com) to look at their tour dates and schedule for Seattle and Bellingham....3B here I come!!  Love you all,  Hillary

      I have no idea what the date is, what day of the week it is...I left my baby Nalgene in VA, all my products in GA (thank you Katie for mailing them to AZ!!!), and I'm sure the Texans took what was left of my soul...I think we're in Santa Fe now...  -Kate (I think)

      Much to Hillary's delight, we are writing this post from the Decatur Public Library.  We'll be off to New Orleans as soon as we get some bloody coffee!  This town actually has a Starbucks! (It's been a looong time since we've seen one of those.)   Thank you so much Katie and Nina for letting us crash at your place last night--and for taking us to see The Sound of Music in the park.  I've been avoiding it all these years...and other than the music, I kind of liked it!  --Kate

      We covered a lot of ground yesterday--about 12 hours of car time--mostly due to the extra time it took to go through Shenandoah National Park (where we nearly got eaten by a black bear!)  Vultures and Bears and Deer--oh my! And my butt really hurts now.  Love to All-Kate   Just as I expected - I LOVE ASHEVILLE!  We went to a fabulous little pub last night, on Mannie's recommendation - we wish Mannie had been with us, but we understand that France must be pretty nice, too!  Walked by the Asheville Public Library today - it was closed, but it looked cute all the same.    Must give props to the waiter at the Sheridan Livery Pub in Lexington, VA, who gave us a HUGE umbrella in a torrential downpour we got caught in yesterday!    Now it's off to GA, to see my best friend from childhood, Katie A. - she saw Robert Redford last week!!  --Hillary

      So we made it - we're in Fairfax Station, VA, staying with Kate's fabulous Aunt Linda and Uncle Richard (who just made us a hearty meal of salmon, asparagus, and salad...and some Fat Bastard wine - thanks, Richard!!).  The trip wasn't too bad - a little traffic craziness, but other than that we did splendidly.  Here are a few vanity plates we saw along the way for your enjoyment:   THNXGOD VA HOMO TNKR BEL HLO OFCR CARAVAN MEGAPOO PRB FAN PTSCAKES ANTSY  And possibly the best one yet...  DONS CRX  We are so proud of Don - he owns a CRX!  Can you believe it?!  Anyway, much love to all our friends from VA - off to Asheville tomorrow (with Mannie on our mind!).  --Hillary  My butt hurts.  --Kate

      The rumors are true: Kate and I will be hitting the open road on June 15th for about a month...we are hoping to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time, and while our itinerary may appear ambitious to some, we know we can do it!  As we travel, we will be updating our blog so that family and friends can keep up with our travel stories, trials, and tribulations.  Stay tuned!  Itinerary for now:  June 15: Northampton --> Fairfax, VA  June 16: Fairfax, VA --> Asheville, NC  June 17: Asheville, NC --> Decatur, GA (hoping to see my childhood buddy, Katie A!)  June 18: Decatur, GA --> New Orleans, LA  June 19: New Orleans, LA --> Texas and beyond (this may need to be reworked, but we want to make it through Texas - a state that could arguably be its own country - as quickly as possible)  June 20: (after a night sleeping in the car or driving all night) Texas and beyond --> Carlsbad or Las Cruces, NM  June 21: NM --> Scottsdale, AZ (see my cousin, Jada!)  June 22 - 23: Still in AZ, may make it to Flagstaff to see the P-Kings (www.patiokings.com/calendar.cfm)  June 24: AZ --> Las Vegas (Patiokings show)  June 25: Still in LV (another Patiokings show - but remember: WE ARE NOT GROUPIES!)  June 26: LV --> LA   June 30: Will be in Eugene, OR  July 1: Eugene, OR --> Portland, OR  July 2: Portland, OR --> Seattle, WA  July 3: Seattle, WA -->  good ol' Bellingham  July 4: Hang out in Bellingham  July 5: Bellingham --> Yakima, WA (see my parents)  July 6 or 7: Yakima --> Glacier National Park (maybe Missoula)  After Glacier, we know we will hit Chicago (more Patiokings), Niagara Falls, and other stuff.  But this part of the trip hasn't been worked out. :-)   --Hillary

      ...off the complimentary bottle of merlot Ralph gave us.  We are home. It pretty much sucks.  The wine is good, though.  My cat pissed everywhere, the car wash I went through today did nothing to get the bug kill off my wrx, and we can't think of a third crappy thing, but believe me, there are many.  Oh, and Toby Maguire is really hot. "Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can..."   It's okay that we are totally broke now, because our kind and generous friends will be taking us out for beer (screw the food) we're sure.  Again, thank you Linda, Richard, Katie, Nina, Jada, Erik, Marin, Robin, Amanda, Jamie, Joan, David, Bodil, Dave, and Janet. And Jeff, of course.  Oh, and Jack and I thank his caretakers (although Jack expressed his gratitude with his teeth and claws), Mike, Pam, Paul, and Satterfield.  Keep on keeping on,  Hillary and Kate

      Well after a night at the Old Town Pub in the very colorful and happy district of Chicago, Kate and I are headed east on 90 until we can't take it anymore or we arrive home, whichever happens first.  Our plan is to only drive a few hours today, maybe until Cleveland, then head to the Falls tomorrow, then home.  So, for those of you who live near us, we will see you soon!!  The other day, Kate and I were at Wall Drug in South Dakota (for those of you who haven't been there, you must go - Wall Drug is a trippy place, with a T-Rex, a 6-foot rabbit, and 5-cent cups of coffee), and we tried on mood rings for fun.  Usually (this won't surprise the people who know me), the color I turn out in the ring is dead black; this time, I got blue, which (and this will surprise those who know me) means relaxed and at ease.  What I'm trying to say is that this trip has definitely done me good, and I won't lie: I'm sad to see it coming to such a fast close.  However, I look forward to sharing my stories and pictures with people and catching up with my friends and family when I return.  By the way, Kate also got blue with the mood ring, which describes perfectly what she's been on this trip: a very patient, relaxed co-traveler and friend.  I'm lucky to have her.  Much love,  Hillary

      Hello, everyone!!  Sorry it's taken me so long to give you the job update, but I have my second interview at the Jones Library in Amherst (http://www.joneslibrary.org/) on Thursday, July 15th.  Which means we need to be back by the 14th, so I can go buy a nice outfit and prepare a bit!  I promise to keep everyone posted, though, on the outcome....library friends? we must go out for cocktails when I return to discuss my future....  Kate and I are in Chicago now, at an adorable little hotel with wireless (thank heavens!!).  Internet access (and, to our dismay, cell phone service) is scarce in Montana, South Dakota, and Iowa, but we made it.  We're off to see our final Patiokings' show, and then we will head for Niagara Falls, then home.  Once we return, I am going to work on a mini-Web site with our photos, so y'all can see what we fell in love with in this amazing country.  Since we actually have an Internet connection, I'm sure we'll post more tonight or tomorrow before we leave the windy city.  Now, I must get my drink on.  xoxoxo,  Hillary

      Garrett and I have both attempted to update the blog with limited success lately...I do apologize (again) for our negligence, but the site is often down.  We are leaving Hil's parents house in Selah, WA, this morning to head over to Missoula...where the P-Kings will be returning the credit card and sweater I lost to me.  And Jeff, my sunglasses are in your car.  While this trip has been a life changing, growth experience, I have obviously not changed all that much.  Thank you very much everyone that has accommodated us on this part of our trip, Joan, David, Amanda, Jamie, Janet, Dave, and Bodil.  Peace-Kate

      I am too ridiculously tired to say anything comprehensible-with one exception. I have entered 3 hold 'em tournies since leaving MA (the only three I have actually played live), and have gotten to the final table all three times--and in the money once.  So NES, sorry, but I've found a new career.  Oh yeah--I lost Hillary's sweater at a lake, my sunglasses at some house, and a credit card at a bar.  (I haven't told Hil yet--shhh)  I've got a fever--and the only prescription is more cowbell baby.  Peace-Kate
