            Aren't y'all happy? It's the HOLS!! But the prob is that we all have the blasted PW hmwk and other homework right?? sigh...      I think i'm going KL tomorrow, so i'll be missing Youth Alpha, jiaen and liany! Sigh again. Hm listening to Linkin Park's Session, i think the drums are really good!!       i got the Linkin Park files from my older sister's desktop: my sis claims no one can hack into her desktop to gain access to her personal files.. BUT I DID!! I rock, don't i? hooboy i hope my sis doesn't see this entry. She'll murder me till the cows come home..haha..     Okay i gotta run now, my sister just came out to get a cup of water (it's 10:30 now, btw.) and suppose she hears the (rather loud) LP music i'm blasting.. Whew she just walked in and walked out without noticing anything! A miracle! I wonder how that happ--oh she has her iPod earplugs on.. sheesh she's like addicted to that little white contraption.     Ya so the point is, i don't really like iPods!! urgh. The second point is that i needa go to sleep now and put on those dastardly night-contacts now.. bye!

        At long last, the horrible tb is in! It's a great accomplishment for a close-to-nonblogger person like me ok.     Can't scan anything, i'm in the school library now..Freezing to death, i tell you. But it's not as cold as the swimming lesson today, my teeth was audibly chattering! I am not exaggerating.    Argh the stupid library com's keyboard is so LOUD when you type! Urgh...I'm half-studying for german test today, half-typing this rubbish thing..ow i think an eyelash is in my eye.     Don't ask me why i'm using pink... just tryin' out all the colours la. Btw have you guys done your hmwk? Hmm wait there is no hmwk..       Ooh i really have to study no, it's 2:56pm & i needa read my txtbk pronto before i fail..Ow i plucked the eyelash from my eye. 2 eyeleashes, in fact.      Gonna sign off in GREEEN!! haha. Ok folks, tata and gd luck for Thursday's (awful, disgusting, diametrically utterly despicable in all eyes except teachers'...) Geog and Science test... Bleaugh.      so ya.. bye!! [P.S.Jiaen loves ac! Jiaen don't kill me, which i think you will but never you mind. :P do i rock or what?]
