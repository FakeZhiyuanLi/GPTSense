						   Man, the crap is hitting the fan big time this week. Can't pay my bills, still have'nt gotten my DMB ticket. I'm hoping to pick it up at fedex today. Man, it's only a month away!!! My little sister is turning 12 in august. So far, I've gotten her " Pirates of the Carribbean " on video, and I'll get her more stuff when Kris gets paid. She's hard to shop for though, she's kinda particular. And Kris has worked nonstop for over a week and plans to continue. I love that he's working so hard, but i feel guilty. As for me, I've had a headache for 3 days and I've been trying to finish that guy's cat painting (ugh) Matter of fact, I better stop jabbin' and get to it.

						   I've been stressed a little lately about my work and the future and the "What does it all mean?" questions ramming my brain and I had a huge fit. I've grown accustomed to them now, sorta the way I'm used to finding the perfect pants in every size but my own (that's a whole other post, and a boring one at that). As usual, I fell from grace about something stupid, trivial, like a brushstroke in the wrong place, went to my room and started to cry. Then Kris asks me what's wrong and I cry more and refuse an answer. After much badgering (i wish he were so persistent in other endeavors, like taking out the trash), he winkles it out of me and it just pours onto him like rain and I feel better, coming through it resolved to change my life and thus change the world. And then I see my crappy painting again.... So I just think the hell with it and go to bed. It always looks better in the morning.

						   Bittersweet chords fade Leaving me in momentary silence Leaving me to feel her pull at my mind And she does And she races through what could have, What should have been but was not, Circumstances being what they were.  And with frustration she comes back to me, And I beg to happy I want to be happy And I am... And she wonders... What could have been? What should have been? What if it had been Circumstances being what they were?  And her madness drives me to distraction As she aims her resentment where my heart lies. And he accepts it. And embraces me. And loves me. And this surreal world I've wilted in disappears  with what could have been, what should have been And I suppose I am content, Circumstances being what they are.

						   I've been spending the whole day thinking of what i wanna do this weekend, what bills need to be paid, what groceries to buy, any other crap i might need and i remembered what my boss was doing today, about entering receipts ("I" before "E" except after "C", thank you "Tailspin"!), so i thought i might try that tonight. Been working on my husbands website, it's gonna be pretty cool. Entered some of my digital art at digitalart.com, hoping it makes it on the site. So, I bid on this DMB ticket on EBAY, GREAT SEAT!!! Problem: guy did'nt pay for a painting he commissioned, so now i don't have the money to pay for it. I'm gonna see if I can wiggle my way around the seller, maybe fudge that it was returned to me or something, since i can't actually send it out til saturday. OH i can't wait to get to this concert, it's gonna be incredible. Hubby won't go, he hates Dave. Go figure.

						   And it's really hot. I mean, fry an egg on my forehead hot. I'm listening to this really great cd, "The magic Box" by john williams. It's all African drums and percussion, with chanting and stuff. I know, sounds totally new age-y, right? Well, it's actually really great to fall asleep to. I've started this painting for my mom, of a faerie. It was supposed to look like her, but she does'nt have the most faerie-like features, so she's now a blond sprite creature. I may finish it, I may not. I had better or she'll confiscate my Malena portrait ( see www.dreamingtreestudio.com/spotlight3.html) again for her office. I had taken it down a few days ago to be put up in a Starbucks (yeah, yuppie, I know, but yuppies like my stuff). Brought it by, the guy loved it, but we could'nt get it to hang up, so as my husband and I go in search of hanging materials only to end up coming back to the Starbucks empty-handed, The guy's manager comes in, loves the painting, but says he can't hang it because they're doing an ABSTRACT mural, and if I had any abstract work, he'd love to hang it. Abstract? Okay, I'm sorry, I have to interject here. I don't get abstract. I'm an artist, I love color and contrasts, but to me abstract is not art, it is a last ditch effort to salvage an unused canvas due to lack of imagination. I mean no offense to abstract artists, I'm sure they do great work, and from what I hear, there's alot of really dense people out there with alot of money that pay for it, but I just don't get it.   Whew!! sorry about that, folks, momentary lapse in sanity.   I love candles. I love scented ones, with smells like rain and waterfall and summer breeze. Makes me happy to smell them. But I'm recovering from a mystery stomach ailment and to smell anything right now kinda sucks, so I'm torn between what my nose wants and what my stomach can stand. It sucks. So does this subject. If you're still reading, I apologize. I'm outtie.  Did I just say "outtie"?

						   I met myself once in blues and greys. Stirring my coffee,  reflections passing through quiet chatter, Skirting racing raindrops.  Spoon tapping the sides of my cup,  I remember thinking of that person I forgot.  I met myself once in reds and yellows. The leaves blanket the ground  And I watch as the wind twists them through the crisp air.  Standing there, with worst intent,  I remember thinking of that person I missed.  I met myself once. The colors are murky looking back. As minutes hold onto hours,  It's hard to recall that person I barely knew  And I'm thinking of that person I lost. And I regret myself.

						   Wow, hey this is my first blog. It's really weird, huh? How people feel they need to share their thoughts with the rest of the world so bad that they go through all the crap of registering and creating profiles and coming up with imaginative yet concealing usernames and password so as not to be identified as the person expressing those thoughts? Babble babble, it's easier to type than write, it all just kinda flows out. Ever listened to a Dave Matthews Band song? I'm a big fan, but this is no puff piece. Just sitting here, trying in vain to find something interesting online to avoid turning off my computer and facing an empty apartment, listening to song #41 when it dawns on me that these songs, this band, this band I adore so much makes me so sad! It never occurred to me that the reason i love it so much is because it depresses me, and how f*cked up is that? Is that supposed to happen? Granted, it makes me insanely happy too, but those moments are few and far between. And even more, sometimes the same song elicits both a postitive and negative reaction from me. Often time, i find myself upset and rejuvenated by the achingly beautiful melodies and instrumental qualities. And that brings to mind another thought... what kind of person have I become? From the person that misses so much the person she used to be, what has changed, really? Ugh, listen to me, I sound like a ReRe.

						   I wanna go to bed. I have a realy bad headache and it's been an awful day. Got bad news about the cat painting: apparently he did'nt like it. I feel like i'm accomplishing nothing. You know how when you're little, and you draw a picture of a rainbow, your parents tell you how great it is and then toss it when you leave the room? That's how i feel. Everyone likes the work. "Oh, that's pretty" blah blah blah. Nobody wants to keep it. What the hell am I doing it for, then? Maybe I need to find a new form. What i really need to do is up and leave and forget all this bullshit that i think is important so that i can really get it done. I feel so suffocated here. I think i've said that before, and I have to wonder if I'm purposely trying to find a way out because I know I have a different path or if my future really is staring me right in the face when i wake up every morning. And all that cosmic bullshit.

						   ...and I'm not sleeping. Playing "Pharaoh", addicted to it ya know. I made a big hair faux pas with highlights, but i'm really just too tired to think about it. Is it pathetic to be so excited about going to sleep? Had a long day to end a short week, you know, something has bothered me for awhile now. My boss once made the comment"this is the best paying job you've ever had, girlie" and it pissed me off! The audacity to think that her daycare was as far as my intelligence had taken me, when in fact, I've left higher paying jobs because they sucked. (Note to self: check out bullshitjob.com) It just chapped my booty.  Fineshed the cat painting, got it framed and everything. Not nearly one of the best, but somewhat worthwhile.  I'm just not in the mood for anything, I just want to get away. How can I be so tired at 23? Why are my mind, body and soul sooo tired? It's like I had a really long previous life and then got shoved right into this one without a lunchbreak. I feel worn, yet like I have so much more I could do. And art. Ever seen Amadeus? There's a scene where Salieri is angry and frustrated with God, asking why he would be given such a strong desire to make the most beautiful music in the world and then be denied the talent to do so. I feel that way, especially when I see what's considered to be beautiful art. Why? Why did you make my soul want it so much that it wears me so thin when I can't do it? Why am I in constant pain? What purpose does this serve, to have me hurt those around me because of my anger and jealousy?  Well, I suppose that's enough blasphemous ranting for today. Join me tomorrow for another episode, full of the fun and laughs you've been unable to find thus far.

						   I can't sleep. Don't really want to, but gotta work tomorrow. Don't know what it is, I'm tired, just... it's normal i guess. Recently heard this great song by Counting Crows, "Holiday in Spain". He sings about how things are just so blah, and how he just wants to get away from it all, away from everybody and everything, take a holiday from life i guess. I feel like that most of the time. If i did'nt love Kris so much, I would pick up and leave right now, just not go into work tomorrow and go away where no one knows me, no one knows where i am, and I can just be alone. Sometimes though, it seems that even that won't be enough to stop me, and I think "would it be that hard to just leave?".  Thoughts like that scare me, enough that I don't take them too seriously. But what if, someday, I did?    I may take a holiday in Spain,     leave my wings behind me.     Flush my worries down the drain     and fly away to somewhere new.

						   Yeah, it's been a doozy. Got my DMB ticket today, very happy with that.  Kris and I fought about bills and such, but who does'nt? I finished the cat painting, it's okay i guess. To tell you the truth, i'm a bit discouraged. I saw this womans art on ebay, Girelli, and she was selling like crazy, beautiful art and i got to thinking about how I could maybe do that if I just worked a little harder, and maybe tried a little more and so I got all sad and played Sims instead. I ran into Charky today. She said to give her a call to do something, but I'm not too god with keeping friends, i go too long without talking to them. I want to, I just put it off for too long. I miss Lucas. I miss Justin and Brad too, but ya know who I miss most of all?  Aaron . And I don't know why. Aaron was a summer boyfriend, about 5 years older than me, and my first serious-in-a-sexual-way relationship. As I slept with him, I flirted with other guys, even went out on a few dates i think,  so our attachment wasn't exclusive, for me anyway. He treated me decent, did normal dumb-ass guy stuff on occassion, but a nice guy. Every weekend, there'd be a party at his place, small and cozy, lots of alchohol, and everyone would end up leaving and we'd do it. And he was really good at it, so I guess that's why I never left. And then I did leave for Arizona. And I realized by way of his letters and a fly down visit that maybe I was more to him than I thought, and maybe I had treated him unfairly also. I remember the last time we were together, he actually went out with me and we did something I liked. We sat at Barnes & Noble and had coffee and people-watched. He wore his glasses, he'd never worn them before, he knew I liked them. And I truly enjoyed his company, and i could see in his eyes that he enjoyed mine. And when I came home, he wrote to me and told me how much he liked it. I never wrote back or called, and hav'nt seen him since. I had a new boyfriend then and he just did'nt seem important anymore. But apparantly he is. I think about him constantly, I search for his name online, I dream about the colors and smells of his house, the constantly burning candles. I think that's why i like them so much now.  And his smell... sometimes I smell it on Kris and I want so badly to make love to him, but the guilt of knowing how i know that scent and that it's the reason for my spur of the moment passion makes me angry and sad. And frightened. That someday, i may give that information away to him, either out of anger, spite, or absent-mindedness and hurt the person I love more than anything. To tell the person that thinks I knew nothing of love until I found him that I did truly love another, and may still do.
