      Welcome to the Eugene Underground.    One would never belive it, but this place was founded by a man who crossed a continent in a horse-drawn wagon.  He and his family faced terrible risks on a good day.    There are very few people like that here today.

      I am shocked that the Red Guard even mentioned the  urlLink death of Sargent Tillman .  I'm stunned that they refrained from their usual editorial bent.    Somebody must have been asleep, or dare we hope that someone is waking up?    Either way,  it's refreshing when a story comes though pure and clear in our local fishwrap.

      Balance is everything, I suppose.   While I am very pleased with my amazingly fast internet service, the cable TV leaves much to be desired.  One has to wade through jillions of Spanish language and home shopping channels just to get to the International channel.  Which only has Chinese programming on occasion.    The nice lady at the Comcast office offered to set us up with  urlLink CCTV 4  for only $14.95 extra.  If  I weren't already sending them a C-note every month, I wouldn't have laughed so hard.  Maybe I should ask for a $1 credit for each channel we don't watch?

      1. Even the finest pressure treated lumber is not square.  It has to be squared off with a good saw. and then coaxed into an almost straight line.  2. One eight-foot board is not equal to two four-foot boards.  One eight foot board is not necessarily eight feet long for that matter.   -One can never measure too many times.   3.  Never fix the blame,  fix the problem.   Either my wife or I forgot to order a significant amount of sub framing.  With that in mind, I'm off to a  urlLink leading purveyor of dead tree flesh.

      Or perhaps it looks like one of those makeshift wooden walks in some boomtown.  I can only say that $300.00 worth of lumber could have been put to a better use today.    I violated some key rule of carpentry today, and I'm too ignorant to know which one.    Back to the books for me, and perhaps a weekend apprenticeship.   And now a tidy little segue:   I have certainly offended our local  urlLink doomsday cult  today.  Not only did I benefit from tree murder,  I also used  urlLink un-natural substances  to prevent my dead treeflesh from going back to mother earth.  (I'm serious! those asshelmets actually talk like that!)  I have to say that our local  urlLink doomsday cult    have not as yet actually murdered anybody.  They have so far been happy just ruining careers.  (But only of chainsaw weilding tree-murderers.)

      I consider Islamists to be a doomsday cult, and the sooner they are enlightened or killed, the better.   Over in Japan, some piddling closure has been given to the victims of another doomsday cult:    Death by hanging for the lot of them!    -Including their   urlLink bloated leader .   Gentle reader, you might be surprised to learn that our friends in Japan occasionally find that a person has done something so irredeemable that they must be hanged.  Stranger still, the condemned only dances on the end of a rope when they are ready to.  (in the zen sense)    I can only hope that an exception is made in this case, and some truly repugnant characters are dragged kicking and screaming to the gallows.  Tomorrow, a treatise on freehand deck building, and a discussion of the doomsday cults here in Skinner's Mudhole.

      After loading the boy and the shotguns in the car,  it occured to me that fireing a 12-gauge a hundred times might not be good for the shoulder.    So we went to play golf instead.  I awoke a 05:00 with my right arm locked above my head.    It took me 20 minutes to get it working, but the worst pain I felt was of the spiritual kind.  Maybe those gross Chinese herbs didn't do a damn thing, but it won't be the first 60 bucks I've wasted on a doctor.

      Saturday, 6/19  Got up at 02:00 to drive my stepson to Seatac.  He's going back to China for the summer, and then four grueling years of eating, sleeping and studying math. -Poor thing...  Got him checked in and in the security line in plenty of time for his flight.  -Have a wonderful time, boy!  Arrived in Seattle's "Chinatown"  at about 09:00.  We were hungry to the point of nausea.  We found one restaurant that was open.  Nobody spoke English or Mandarin.  We had some very interesting dim-sum.   To be fair; the pastries and tea were excellent, Mrs. EU loved some of the more "exotic" offerings,  and I'd give high marks for prep and presentation.  I think it was just that I  simply wanted a decent cup of coffee and a donut, and the missus wanted a bowl of noodle soup. -Well, travelers must adapt.    We noted an opening shop across the street, the English sign just said "grocery."  Mrs. EU said, "We can get your shoulder fixed over there." -Apparently the Chinese sign said a  great deal more.    ( NB:  I've been walking around with a completely destroyed rotator cuff for about two years.  I can't lie on that side or use the arm to push down.  Driving a screw, hammering a nail, -even buttering toast is out of the question. Typing isn't exactly a church social either.)  Well, we went in and, two words: FESTER'S LABORATORY!!!!!  There were dried animals of every species.  There were rows of glass cabinets with every piece of every plant that you could possibly imagine.  Behind the counters were drawers. Above the drawers were shelves. Upon the shelves were immense jars.  It was sort of like a dessicated Noah's Ark.  Fortunately, the clerk spoke excellent Mandarin, so we were in business!  She and the missus chatted for some time.  Sadly, they didn't have the exact preparation my wife had in mind, but something even better! -A real live Chinese herb doctor!    This tall wiry gentleman in a perfectly white and pressed coat comes out and leads me back to his exam room.  We sit, and he senses my qi. He then asked me if there was any pain other than my right shoulder? A parlor trick?  Maybe. -I suppose I telegraph some weakness in that shoulder. Anyhow, it was pretty impressive at the time.    He then starts to gather stuff onto about 15 different plates.  I identified two species of oak, one of teak, two of pine, and three of maple. There were also slivers of various mushrooms, twigs, leaves, and etc.   He mixed it and divided it into seven bags.  I was instructed to boil the contents of each bag in a liter of water until there was about a cup of liquid left. Then, to drink the liquid.  Oh, by the way, it's best to let it get luke-warm and then just slam it. -By all means, don't try to taste it.    Well, you might as well tell Eurydice to not look back into Hades, but let me tell you, I've had scotch and coffee that tasted worse.  I place this goo somewhere between a Loch Dhu without the alcohol, and a bad espresso without the acidity.   I just finished dose 5. I'll let you know if it fixes my arm.

      AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!   That's what I said when I saw that title in my inbox. Fortunately it was just the latest Email from  The Butt  The Bus. The PDX progs preached their usual message, then provided a link to this:   urlLink  Avoiding Federal Fiscal Catastrophe: Honest Politics and Health Care Reform .  Here's a taste:   Since Aaron was addressing a progressive audience, he took pains to point out that these projections dont allow for any increases in programs that progressives would support  subsidized child care, more low-income housing, high-speed rail, insuring the uninsured. His message was that if progressives dont want the deficit to drown out any hope for their goals, theyd better start addressing long-term problems now.  For instance, start supporting the crazy notion of self-sufficiency. The majority of the people who will be facing the 2060 federal budget haven't been born yet. Prevent them from being slack-asses and needing subsidized child care, low-income housing, and free insurance by being  parents! Now!     The audience was stunned. Essentially, Aaron was saying that we should be advocating massive tax increases just to hold onto the programs we have now. That didnt seem very appealing to anyone.   It didn't? Wait, there's a rift in the ideology here. Who's usually  for  tax hikes so that these social programs can flourish? Where is this money going to come from? The cleanup of government waste?  (Insert Nelson catchphrase here. {see update} )    But nobody disagreed with Aarons math.   That's because no one there made it past algebra. After all, college is for art and music and Marxist professors and homosexual experimentation.      She was a lonely voice, but shes obviously right. Progressives need to launch a Manhattan Project on health care cost controls. Whether its  adopting a single payer system, rationing, nationalizing the drug companies, restricting the amount of expensive machinery   whatever it is  we cannot talk about health care without talking about how the hell we are going to prevent health care costs of current programs from growing to 14%% of GDP.     single payer system  - healthy people pay as much (probably more) as 2 pack a day smokers  rationing  - "So sorry that your cancer has returned, old chap, but that's all the therapy you are allotted. Good day."   nationalizing the drug companies  - Yeah, I'm sure pharm R&D will stay at the current level when they no longer have any revenue.  restricting the amount of expensive machinery  - This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Has this idiot ever been in a hospital? "Well, we weren't able to buy a new x-ray machine, but we can see if you have a broken bone the old fashioned way. Here, hold this piece of Radium and I'll hold the film. Madame Curie would be proud."   The last line of this article should be over the door at the DNC:   Aarons presentation left little room for hope. But maybe we can get somewhere with rage.     Because look what rage has done for the credibility of Al Gore and Howard Dean.     Update:  urlLink click here.

      So I bought  A Perfect Circle - The Thirteenth Step , because they seem to be the only decent rock band in existence anymore (at least that I hear in the radio-only Tercel of Commute). I have listened to the whole CD more than once while driving around in the recently acquired minivan, and wasn't impressed. It seemed to lack the depth and dynamics I expected; I thought maybe Maynard didn't want APC to be known as The Little Tool That Could, so he kept it sullen.   Well, I brought the disc to work today, listened to it on the work system.  Analysis - It is really good. The stereo in my van is very lousy. Lousy to the point it can influence my perception of quality music. I thought maybe this was a subconscious thing, but I'm skilled in the audio wave propagation arts to the point where such a notion is far-fetched. At least I think I am. Bottom line is I gotta get some serious audio equipment in the van. I'll work on it.   Back to the CD -  First, APC is NOT tool. They lack the both-sides-of-the-spectrum sweeping dynamics that makes you (well, me anyway) think Tool is the most intense radio band ever. Also missing is the bass guitar use as more than a filler/rhythm instrument. However APC can make a song that is both muted yet moving. Their music can be quiet, yet not boring and repetitious. I'm not trying to connect the two groups, but you can't help comparing them.

      Most people who are too "poor" to afford healthcare are probably smokers and/or drinkers (A wise man once said, in regards to sin taxes, "Hey, they need something to escape their miserable lives"). In fact, I would believe a study group if they told me that health problems among the uninsured were due  largely  in part (20% perhaps?) to smoking. Sounds plausible, right?   Now you want to give these people healthcare?  Here you go, free oxygen, x-rays and chemo. Smoke with impunity.    Where am I going with this?   (Government) You know, we'd save serious money if these people didn't smoke. I know,  let's regulate it - no one on USAHillaryKerryKennedyHealthPartners can be smokers and receive treatment.   See that? They gotcha. The control of the State envelops everyone. I doubt those who are advocating for free healthcare want the gov't to tell them they can't smoke.  I'm going to point out to my kids what happens to you when you don't work hard so that you can get fixed at the hospital (not 'fixed', just..y'know, fixed. Healed.) I'll do that next time I'm downtown, lots of visual aids.

      From  urlLink Michelle Malkin  (see the tiny blogroll to the right)     Socialism is alive and well right in my backyard. This article describes how militant central planners are trying to prevent a local hospital chain, Adventist Healthcare, from building a new emergency department in my town, Germantown, Maryland, which is a booming suburb of Washington DC.  There is no question that there is great demand among Germantown residents for a new facility. The closest existing emergency department, a 40 minute drive during rush hour, is badly overcrowded. More than 4,000 residents have signed a petition in support of a new facility.  But in Maryland no one can build a new hospital or emergency department without first obtaining permission from a state agency called the Health Care Commission. The premise behind this system is that central coordination prevents redundancy in health care infrastructure, holding health care costs down, whereas market competition leads to excess capacity, driving health care costs up.  Barbara McLean, the commission's executive director, explained her opposition to the Germantown project this way:       "We question the wisdom of setting up that kind of system," McLean said. The proposal in effect would create a five-bed hospital without the majority of services normally provided at a hospital and in an area that currently has no need for another hospital, she said.      It would "ultimately lead to the proliferation of small, specialty hospitals providing extremely limited services and add unnecessary costs to the health care system," according to the report.       (Some of the post removed by me)  Sound familiar? I wonder if Maryland has a Land Use Board of Appeals, or nutjob residents who think  they  know where a hospital should be built.

      Hey kids, be sure to let the city know that privitzation of the fire services at the Eugene Airport is a good thing, despite the half page ads against it in the Red Guard recently.  After all, it doesn't take three firefighters and a fire boss to put out a fire caused by an ill-placed cigarette butt (which is probably the last 'disaster' to occur at EUG). Oh, one of those Government employee+Union member employees may have missed a break once(a true disaster), but I doubt it. The more this money sucking gov't acts like a business, the better.

      Once upon a time, there was a sensitive young man.  He had boyish good looks, and deep sad eyes.  He was what we would call a vegan these days.  He neither smoked nor drank.    He advocated free health care, no pollution, limited forestry, animal rights and etc.  Today's  urlLink progressives  would've loved him.    His name was Adolph Hitler.  Hitler was a progressive.  That's my theory.  He and his cronies didn't come to power by promising to destroy a generation, and ruin the continent.  They came to power by promising a lot of "puppies and kittens" cowplop.  They probably believed it themselves early on.

       urlLink Burning a lumberyard  to protest deforestation and sprawl is like......well......OK I don't have a good comparison. But common sense analysis says, 'don't do anything that will cause the other side to do MORE of what you're opposed to (in this case, harvesting trees), ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT WINNING, and YOU'RE THE EXTREME MINORITY!'   The ELF has targeted lumberyards in the past, claiming they contribute to ecological destruction and sprawl.  Lumberyards cause sprawl like spoons cause obesity.   In other  urlLink tree-hugging news , crews got to start 7 hours late after GreenPeas wasted resources on a shipping container.  After authorities removed three protesters locked inside and outside the shipping container to prevent its movement, loggers  hooked a chain to the back of a pickup truck  and dragged the 20-foot container to the side of the road, getting to work seven hours late on the Soukow timber sale about five miles west of Glendale (emphasis mine.)    HAH! They moved it with a pickup truck! Y'know for about the same price, you could've dumped a bunch or rock in the middle of the road; at least they would've had to use equipment (other than what the men drove to work in) to take care of it. You might've put them behind a whole day!   I wonder how many beached whales one could stuff into said container? Or how many pounds of Little Lisa's Fish Slurry one would hold?

           While driving the other day, the guy on the radio was talking about former president Reagan's death. More specifically, he proclaimed it was one of those events that you always remember where you were when you heard the news. I thought about my token example of that experience - the space shuttle Challenger exploding. I thought "I remember  that  day, in Mrs. Henke's 4th grade class. Wait. Right? 4th grade?" I had to think about it a bit because history gets smudged a bit for me. Incidentally, that was also right around the time a more personal wierd thing happened -  A plane crashed on our street.  Please hold handrail.        My teacher told me and Darla Pederson (a girl who lived down the street from me) to go outside the classroom; Darla's mom was at ths school and wanted to talk to us. I wasn't worried; I was a good kid so I didn't freeze up when sent out of class - rather I thought I was going to be praised for a spelling test, or given a second lunch(Ooooh how great that'd be! Another pizzaburger!!), or handed a medal or something else silly that 9 year olds think. Darla's mom told us that a small plane had crashed while decending toward the airport runway, which was less than a mile from our house.  She assured us that no one was hurt (the pilot died - I don't remember if she told us that or not), and not to be afraid when we walked home, because there would be lots of police and such.  Lemme tell ya, my first reaction was 'I can't  wait  to see this!' Not only because of my 9 year curiosity of wreckage, but my fascination of airplanes as well(even thought we lived underneath the damned things for 14 years). My walk home was anticiaption filled - going to see a wrecked plane, up close, on a sunny spring day. Our street was barricaded, of course. Imagine if you will, the standard trailer park - rows of aluminum breadboxes placed neatly and uniformly in rows on both sides of narrow roads, creating neighborhoods (or at least, what   I   knew of neighborhoods. I passed the barricade and told an officer I lived down the street. He waved me by, and I poured my vision over the sight. There it was - the left wing of Cessna jutting out of a pile of metal and fabric that used to be someone's home. It was about 10 houses away from ours, which in trailer park measurements is about 75 yards.  Good thing no one was home  I thought. And although the airplane did hit other trailers, the one it became a part of was a  mess . Years later a gaggle of tornadoes would be standing around looking at a picture of this, nod and look at each other saying "Niiice Woorrrk!!" My mom (who was home at the time) and I talked about what happened, etc. Over the next few weeks, the buzz died down, things were cleaned up, life went on.        Snap back to present day, as I'm driving and thinking about this.  Damn, it could have been our house that got hit by the plane.  What then?  My mom was home. Why was she home? She worked every day since I could remember.  By now I had done the math (or so I thought - I'm still fuzzy on when this all happened) and said,  My brothers are 9 and 11 years younger than me. My mom must have been on maternity leave. One brother born on Feb., the other in Jan. It was early spring when this happened.  The realization: a strong wind out of the East and a pilot's decision from bad to worse would have left me an only child with no mother. It hit me pretty hard; I think my jaw hung loose all the way home, partially because I'd never done this analysis before.        Oh yeah, and the Challenger blew up too.

      I took my last final Friday morning (and was too busy to blog all weekend), so I'm officially done with the 2003-2004 school year. The atmosphere in the library Friday morning was indicative of finals week; about 20 people using the computer area that accommodates 150, and work study kids behind the information desk eyeing passersby with solemn contempt ( "Would you people hurry up and leave so that I can go DRINK already!" )Unfortunately for them, happy hour was a long way off, and a slow day was in the way - no one checks out books or needs help finding a certain journal on the last day of the school year. Well, maybe grad students. Nerds.   "The  urlLink Kelley Engineering Center  is going up quickly", I think to myself. Looking at the giant crane I was reminded of last fall, when my vector calc class was migrating to another building on campus. As we passed, we all watched this massive structure being erected by a smaller, yet still massive mobile crane. My thoughts go back to the progress of the build. There was a time when I would have considered the notion that experts -- quality thinkers and doers -- were due credit for what's been done in that amount of time. From the engineering team to the welder on the frame of the 2nd floor, these guys have a work ethic and a desire for excellence so strong that the physical evidence (the building) was the progress.  But instead, in a loathful voice I said, "Bet the state's burning huge sums of money to get this thing done so fast." My faith in the tireless proud worker is beaten with a stick when the state of OR gets involved.

      Roy is about 76 and a widower.  He has been too infirm to work his ranch for some years now.   When he and his wife were in their 20's they wisely planted Doug fir and mixed hardwoods on about a third of their spread.  It is now a respectable stand of timber and would have made a decent retirement fund.   It would have, except for our local  urlLink Doomsday cultists.   He has been prevented from cutting one tiny sapling for fear of harming  spotted owl habitat. Roy's house got pretty worn down, and he still wouldn't take help from anybody.  Social services moved him into one of those geriatric warehouses.  I suppose the property will be sold for taxes one of these days. Those owls are doing a lot better than Roy and a bunch of old ranchers just like him.

      Looking at the City/Region section of the paper the other day, there was two articles on the front page of interest. One article about the Police officer on trial for abusing his power to sexually assault women, and another about the groping high school teacher. Now, the following comparison is missing something - it is a snapshot; it is not with respect to time. But it's what came to mind in the time I was perusing the paper. And remember, many modern arguments ignore many more variables than just time.   1 POLICE OFFICER is an abusive sexual deviant (pending conviction). Therefore...   1 out of 172 Eugene police officers are power abusing sex criminals.   1 TEACHER can't stop touching teenage girls. Therefore...   1 out of '800' (I'm guessing that number on the high side) high school teachers are juvenile gropers.    12 (last I heard) US soldiers have been convicted/indicted for prisoner abuse. Therefore...   12 out of 116,000 (or 1 in 9667) US soldiers abuse foreign prisoners.    According to the law of averages, it is far better to be an Iraqi citizen than a Eugene citizen, if you rely on the police and the public school system.

      I propose a day called 'Miserable Failure Day', where everything that exists in a less than ideal condition is blindly labeled a miserable failure.    "My lunch is a miserable failure. They put onions on - - I said no onions."   "You forgot your world history book at home? This is a miserable failure for one 7th grader, isn't it?"   "So usually when I get to the coffee shop I get there when no one else is in line and the two women who come in after me usually yknow well today they were in front of me and I had to wait My coffee trip was a miserable failure."   "Ready for this miserable failure of a meeting?"  Write your own miserable daily statements in the comments section. Difficulty parameter added: No references to Sen. Kennedy.

      It's just time to brace-up and be cheerful.  America was beginning a long slow slide into insignificance when that man took the helm, and he sure did have a great life.  Unlike that Hockypup, I was 19 when Reagan took office.  I was at a liberal arts College, and my politics were millimeters to the right of Mao.   I was shocked that Carter hadn't won by a landslide!  By the time Mondale got absolutly creamed, and I was a workin' man it all started to make sense. Oh the stories I could tell.  Unfortunately, my son's graduating tonight, so you should go read  urlLink this guy  instead.

The NO-DONG missile. It may be childish, but I  giggle  release a deep-throated HAH! whenever I hear that. Hats off to North Korea for the worst name for a weapon since the scud.

      I wish I could put up an excellent post saluting the accomplishments of our 40th president, but I was 4 when he was elected. This makes it difficult for me to speak intelligibly about his presidency. Besides, many others have done an excellent job at singing his praises. I look forward to learning more about him this summer; I'm sure some retrospectives will be released soon.   May his ideas and his stature live on.

      Me: Hi, my wife bought the wrong baby wipes - I have some other shopping to do, can I just get a refund?  Girl at Service Counter: Sure. (Eyeing receipt) But I can only give you $4.99 back [cost $5.99], because you used a $1 coupon.   M: Wha? But then if I pick up the same priced item and go through the line, they'll charge me $5.99, right?  G: Um, yeah. I can do an exchange, if you want.    I didn't bother pointing out the searing fact that we had already effectively given the store $5.99 for the product, BECAUSE THE STORE GETS A DOLLAR FROM THE MANUFACTURER FOR THE COUPON! I thought this was common knowledge in the retail sector; maybe that's just my opinion based on the years of grocery store work under my belt. Also, I'm sure this girl has to put up with enough idiots (after all, I  was  in Springfield).  EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED WORKING IN A GROCERY STORE  1. Any customer service job makes you appreciate common sense, and loathe the lack thereof. At least it would, if there was any common sense on display.   2. It sure is nice when everything is arranged in rows, but sometimes you can't get everything to fit in the row space you have. This forces you to get creative.   3. Old people are lousy at finding the olives (they're in aisle 3, ma'am).   4. A well trained power jack operator  can  unload a semi truck full of cereal and canned vegetables in under 5 minutes, with or without a hangover.   5. The most difficult food to clean off a tile floor is pancake syrup. The smelliest food to clean off a tile floor is a mixture of oyster sauce and rice wine vinegar.   More grocery store musings to come; maybe a separate post. I bet you're thrilled.

      OK, shall we begin?  At the behest of the 'Eugene Rant' Guv'nor (Bob), I've been offered a miniscule corner of the blogosphere for myself. I'd like to think I'm snatching it up like a doberman to a filet, but I guess it could be described as Bob using all ten of his fingertips, gently but intently, to push me past my objections (no time, no resources, yadda, yadda, yadda) and get some ideas into open space. That is, after our radio talk show idea fell through.  As I said, all my quips come two minutes too late for radio. (Costanza)  That's it! That's what I shoulda said!  What do I bring to Eugene Rant? Bob will take care of the politics and policy stuff (to which I'll lend a hand); I'd like to put up some realizations, some wit, and the blatantly obvious happenings that define the seemingly boundless idiots of our day, both locally and globally.  What do I hope to get from Eugene Rant?  The usual I guess - a place to share ideas, get things off my chest, use cliches at will  to hell with that. (Bob, is 'hell' OK? Y'know, it's kinda hard to tell you I want something to go to  HELL  without using the word  HELL .)

      Not content with  urlLink evicting their white "oppressors,"  Expropriating all  white-owned property, and  urlLink sending gangs out to murder their   opponents ,  urlLink Robert Mugabe's  government now wants to     ban the color red from television broadcasts.    " urlLink We can do what we like with the spectrum, whatever that is, " said Solly. "We are not bound by Western concepts."   We don't often see such  crystalline thuggish disregard for reason and logic.     I only wish to point out that Mugabe did not come to power by promising to direct terror against whites, nor did he promise to plunge Zimbabwe into bankruptcy.  urlLink  He promised the entire gamut of progressive claptrap!

      An interesting discussion has ensued in the comments section of  urlLink Michelle Malkin's blog  after she posted this story. I posted a comment, but I found I misread the article after finding the story on AP (it was the pronouns!! I swear!)  My comments notwithstanding, the other commenters are sharing a great theme. IF you are 18 years old with three kids, it's time to change your life. Hell, please feel free to do so beforehand, perhaps after the second child is born. You may want to STOP spending time with the illegal immigrant (this label carries little water, but it's worth mentioning) drug-addled, armed man who you just recently filed assault papers against. If anything, this may serve as a horrible example of the repercussions of associating with said persons.   I don't like to use second-hand opinions, but the ideas of Bill O'Reilly's book (WLOFY) are ringing in my head. To paraphrase, he says surround yourself with people who are in a position to help you out, who care for your well-being. If you are associated with people who do themselves harm, you are putting yourself into a position to be harmed. A lot of blame can be assessed in this situation; immigration and law enforcement for not deporting/jailing this scumbag, family services for not righting this girl (first child born at  fifteen  years old), the war on drugs, the war on gas (see comments on Michelle's blog), assumed lousy/non-existent parents of the girl, etc. But the blame falls on poor choices by this woman influenced by a seedy environment.   What will it take until teens can see the connection of piss poor behavior with  incidents  tragedies? This sign on the Washington highway perhaps as a chilling reminder:     I know people like to use the sign builder in a more light-hearted manner, but my disgust at child tragedy coupled with my common sense head slapping is going to sometimes call for a sign. No morbid feelings intended.

      Bastille day.  Today we celebrate the death of the last classical Monarchy, and birth of the first Communist regime.  urlLink (thanks to Dr. Ray)     But, who is this French girl?  What is she telling the masses?         Would you believe she's telling them about the virtues of free markets?  The evils of overfed and underworked civil servants?  That if 80% of their pay didn't go to fund the well-larded government, they might be able to pay for their own education, retirement, and health care?  Well, that is exactly what she's doing! And that hell kitten is only 21.   Her name is Sabine Herold, and she's something of an accidental hero.  Last year, the public sevice unions all went on strike because the government thought they ought to work a  little  harder.  As the garbagemen, teachers, and bus drivers were marching through her home town, she got up and denounced them!   In moments, she found herself surrounded by 2000 of her fellow citizens and they were cheering her on!

      When that day arrives, we can arrange a  urlLink counter-protest to this  on very short notice. Today is Bastairrde day, or something like that. Downtown Eugene citizens will be celebrating with well-thought out, respectful opposition to  the president   the war  life as we know it as a show of solidarity with France.   For next year, when all of you will be our 'unofficial minions', we need ideas for our counter protest. Examples:  1. Carry white flags.  2. We will have face-painting for the kids, but the only thing we can paint is tears.   Leave your ideas in the comments.  I  knew  I should have bought a  urlLink Frank J  'Fun facts about he French' shirt.

      From  urlLink Wordsmith :  philodox (FIL-uh-doks) noun     Someone who loves his or her own opinion; a dogmatic person.  [From Greek philodoxos, from philo- (love) + doxa (glory, opinion). Ultimately from Indo-European root dek- (to take or accept) that's also the root of words such as paradox, orthodox, doctor, disciple, discipline, doctrine, dogma, decorate, dignity, and disdain.]   Aren't we all a little philodox from time to time?

We'll blogroll you if you suck, in hopes that you'll afford me the same courtesy.   What I'd really like is to blogroll a couple of blogs that contain some great antelope recipies.

You can't just force me to go to some website. Explain yourself.   OK, OK, I'll explain before you go. It's a letter of opposition to the UN and the EU to show the worldwide support for the Israeli security fence. Basically, you're signing a piece of paper (along with millions of others) that says the fence should stay, after Israel makes some adjustments to ease *insert CNNReutersNYTQuotemark* Palestinian hardship *end CNNReutersNYTQuotemark* (Hardship? Such as the difficulty the fence imposes to get a suicide bomber even  near   a bus?)  I've told you enough. Go now, then return to post a comment or two.   Please?

       urlLink This article  got my blood pumping.   50 years ago, The Isaac Walton League set up a gun range in what was then the middle of nowhere.   Now, the area is becoming gentrified.  Some of their more histrionic new neighbors have been harassing the club in courts for years.    Didn't those newcomers notice that they were building their yuppie palaces near a shooting range? Didn't they wonder why the land was so cheap?  Perhaps they should be suing their realtors?  In the latest round of litigation,  12 of Eugene's wise citizens have awarded the neighbors 28-grand in damages, because the nearby creek  might be polluted with lead.    EVEN THOUGH NO FEDERAL, STATE, OR PRIVATE AGENCY HAS EVER FOUND ANY!!!   The Neighbor's claims have NO BASIS in science or fact.  I do hope that the club will persist through to the state level.  I am confident that they will get the judgment overturned.  Maybe they'll even recover their legal fees.  In a perfect world, one particular ambulance chaser would be disbarred.   Another way the left is undermining the second amendment is by litigating against any business that helps an ordinary citizen gain the necessary proficiency to bear arms.  We see lawsuits against manufacturers,  impossible zoning requirements for gun shops, and all sorts of bogus noise and pollution complaints against ranges.    I wonder who's next?

      I don't think anybody ever blogs because they think anybody else actually  wants  to read their thoughts.  It's just something they gotta do.   And you gotta do what you gotta do.  On the other hand, we did get almost 200 hits in our first month.  Not too shabby.   But it's always good to review one's purpose.  It helps clarify thoughts and focus efforts.  With that in mind,  let's restate the purpose of this blog:     -Free Markets  -Rational thought  -Limited Government    Right here in the People's Republik of Eugene.  Here's our mission statement.  It's so simple, that we don't even need to print it on a laminated card:   TAKE 'EM DOWN!   So, Mr. Hate filled underachiever who hides his contempt for the world in a green sauce of Eco-nut mantras:         You are going down.   Ms. Economic-justice crusader who destroys businesses because of her concern for the poor:         You are going down.     Even you, Mr Pink Rebublican, who sees increased government as the only way to fix problems.        Right down with the rest of them.    Saving the world is really hard work, but I promise to pick two or three local items every week and take 'em down.   Thanks for listening    Update: I hope Bob doesn't mind me stringing my thoughts onto his posts. I guess he doesn't, or you wouldn't be reading this.    Rational Thought:  To this end, my posts are (mostly) rationalized by past experiences and firsthand knowledge, but the world's a big place. If anyone spots holes in my analysis, please let me know. We'll have cawfee an' tawk.   The Pink Republican mentioned above has a name in my mind. Pat Farr. Quoth: "I'm a republican, but I'm a republican from Eugene." So I guess he's lukewarm to government control, social spending, etc.    I smell waffles. Mmmmm, waaaffles. (/Homer)   Update by hockeypuck

      So Whoopi acted like a half-drunk hack in order to drum up the I-wanna-be-an-outspoken-dreadlock-hipster-with-a-successful-acting-career crowd. Well done. We'd all like to hang out downtown at the elite coffee shop all day long, getting rich in the background. Unfortunately, sometime someone has to get off the Friends couch and WORK, otherwise nothing gets done. If there is a theme I hope to write along when talking about left-wing idiots, it's that their vain attempt to be hip supersedes their ability to make logical decisions based on previous results. That said, it's important to also remember the popular saying, "Past performance is no guarantee of future results." Gee, I'm starting to sound like a logical independent.     Newman took off on his fiscal policies, saying, "I think that tax cuts for worried, wealthy thugs like me are borderline criminal," and the notion they produce trickle-down benefits for the poor is "rubbish."   Hillary's income redistribution will work so much better than trickle-down theory, I'm sure. Hey Paul, I know you are a champion of charity, and I applaud you for that. But if that wealth-induced guilt is too much for ya, perhaps what would work much better than the money-sucking government programs who help no one would be a private assistance society (read: Hull House.) Be a Jane Addams philanthropist. Remember, regime change begins at home. (Man, I hate threadbares.)  Update: mmmK,  urlLink someone did this better than me . Goldberg is a decent actress IMO, but she's not funny, as pointed out by Ace Of Spades. But I beat him/her to the HW squares ref (I think).

      Those of you who read  urlLink Bill Whittle's blog  (assuming you have enough time for long essays) have probably read  urlLink strength Part I . An excerpt:    Honor and shame trump everything in that world. A pithy sentence, eh? So instead, think about what it would take for you to kill your own daughter with a knife, with your bare hands, because she was seen in the company of a man not her husband or a relative? Think about that. Think long and hard. What kind of hatred and shame could drive a human being to do such a thing? What kind of pressures does that society bring to bear on an individual to make him capable of that? How different is their view of women, of family, of honor and shame? What would it take for you to murder your daughter with a knife, or a knotted cord Â with your own two hands and against her pleading, her protestations, and her begging for her life? If your response wasnÂt Âthere is nothing that could make me do that,Â then stop reading right here and get the hell off my property.  Multi-culturalists will respond that Honor Killings are not the norm and not representative of Islam and life under Shariah. We can debate the exact numbers of these horrors for days, but the fact remains that no matter how many individual cases there are,  there is de facto legal protection for committing these crimes.  When Islamic schoolgirls attempting to escape a burning building with their faces uncovered were sent back inside to die by the religious police rather than dishonor Islam Âwell, that is a brush that will carry a lot of tar.  (Emphasis mine)     Go read some brilliant essays. Then return and continue.   This seems to stir up my feelings of the recent bankruptcy declaration by the Catholic Church. The above description of killing your own child makes me physically wince much like I would expect any catholic (or human being, for that matter) to do once they hear of  another  priest/boy relations. Bankruptcy declarations, out of court settlements, public apologies...all these things marginalize the despicable behavior of these "disciples of God's word". Nothing but gut-wrenching shame should be displayed by the entire Catholic body for years and years.   But you say, "It's been blown up." "This doesn't happen very often, just glorified in the media." "These are just people trying to class-action legitimate sex abuse cases, which are very few and far between." Listen to me. It shouldn't happen  ever.  If it happened once, OK, one bad apple. Send him to prison. It happened twice, well, you should suffer as a collective entity. However, with thousands of claims against the church within the last 5 years, the Catholic Church should be viewed by red-blooded Americans with more disdain than that currently collectively held for the UN, France and Al Qaeda. I don't hate Catholics, but because of your recent collective actions, I reserve the right to deride you at will, and stay the hell away from my kids, or you'll bleed.   I'm surprised there aren't more off-color jokes circulating about the Catholic Church these days, with pedophilic abuses being their media forte. I've only heard one. If anyone knows any good ones, Email me.    There was a clever cartoon in the paper:  Some kids are in Sunday school, and one asks the teacher, "When Jesus loved the little children, did he go to jail?"   urlLink Here's another one that I can link.  --Bob

      I'm addicted to blogs.   (I don't like that song, I'm not sure why I thought it would be clever.)  Obviously, not addicted to this  blog, but other people's.   Nary a workday goes by where I don't spend my break time (or possibly a little more time) reading blogs. Most of them are the high profile one's in everyone's history (for example - Lileks's TibetanYarnNoodles.com, Everyonehaveahappyspoonsexperience.com, bludgeoningIMAO.us) but I've found myself bouncing around people's blogrolls and looking at little personal blogs (like this one.) Today I thought, "Why?" I don't like people, people often annoy me - why do I care what they scrawl on a post or two? Maybe I'm intrigued by those of us who can do this, and impessed by those who do this well. After all, not everyone writing a blog gets on the elevator with me and tries to make small talk for no reason at all.  'Uuuuggghh, only Tuesday, huh?'  I half-smile and hope they'll go away.

      Every other blog is selling T-shirts, and we don't even have a logo.  (Sigh.) The other day, I saw a guy who was wearing the  stupidest  T-shirt ever:  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR... DON'T PISS ME OFF!  Let's say somebody is a really  good  fighter, would they advertise like that?    What if somebody isn't too good with their fists?  When they're about to get anihilated, do they say, "OH!  The shirt?  -I was just kidding."   OK, Mr. DON'T-PISS-ME-OFF, what gives?  Why did you get dressed today with such a singular lack of taste and discernment?  Did you think you might get better service at the clinic because you wore that?

      After a week hiatus, I return to Eugene Rant.   I'm saddened today by the death of Marlon Brando. Vito Corleone is one of my all time favorite film  (read 'film', not 'movie')  characters.   The Eugene Police are trying to regain the respect of the community. Half of Eugene was already disrespectful to the police because they might find their stash, and the other half thinks a police-free society is plausible. They have an uphill battle.

       urlLink Barbie is damaging to American girls with her materialistic ways  - you've heard this before. While I agree with the anti-Barbie crowd (to a very limited extent) that she could use a little smartnin' up sometimes, this stickery article reflects the local tone toward, well, frankly, what we'll call 'an American toy'.    So what's on Barbie's mind these days?  The November election? Holes in the ozone? Stephen Hawking's recent reversal on subatomic theory?   Well, these  are  all things on the minds of most 5 year old girls in America.   Nope - she's looking for just the right pair of floral-design pumps.   Girls buying shoes! What next!?   A wonderfully shameless display of cross-branding is one thing. But a Barbie who pigeonholes girls in an antiquated stereotype?   Young slender women at the mall carrying bags is now a stereotype, says the guy whose ideals probably include the loathing of any center of commerce.     "How do you spell 'ugh'?" asked Debbie Newman, a stand-up comic in Eugene. "But what are you going to do? That's what advertisers tell little girls they want: Little boys want to play with guns and little girls want to play with makeup. It's just not letting  women  be as much as they can be."   Any 'women' who purchase and play with this doll have  this doll  to blame for their lack of success in life. Got it. Please continue.    But Newman, an office manager with Schnitzer Steel, would rather see the toy company introduce "Office Manager" Barbie.  "She'd be just crabby all the time," Newman said. "And outside her little Barbie office would be 17 people lined up needing something from her."   She'd be crabby, indicating that 5 year olds should carry that attitude, while being as much as they can be. If Barbie's life sucks as an office manager, could I suggest Barbie Community College? Moving on.    "Mayor Barbie," the doll dreamed up by Kitty Piercy, 62-year-old nominee for the post in Eugene.   Piercy, although absent the shopping gene, said she's OK with shopping Barbie ... as just one manifestation of the countless roles that women play in society.  "I'd like to see 'President Barbie,' " she said. "I'd like to see Barbies in different sizes, shapes and colors, Barbies of different ages - and there's no limitation to what a Barbie can be or do."   Because every kid wants "Golden Age Barbie". Hey Kitty, how about pro-choice Barbie? I won't go into a description, I just can't do it. All I'll say is, abdomen made of pliable material.  This  is how you spell 'UGH'. I can't believe I'm posting this.     Sally Sheklow, a 53-year-old founding member of the Eugene women's comedy troupe, WYMPROV!, said "Improv Barbie" would have "a belly and a butt and hips, nipples."  "Improv Barbie" would use props and shop the garage sales, not ALDO, Sheklow said. Above all else, she would enjoy free license to speak her mind ... for laughs.  "She could get away with saying anything about the need for regime change without fear of repercussion," Sheklow said, "because she'd be a comic."   Because we know all Barbie can say now is:  I wish they taught shopping in school! Let's bake some cookies for the boys! Don't ask me, I'm just a girl. Let's buy makeup so the boys will like us. Now low let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream! (episode 1F12)  Too bad Barbie wouldn't be calling for regime change, that "regime"'s ideals made her a household name.   I guess all I have to do is proclaim my status as a comic, to avoid the 'Wrath-croft' of the government.  (Yeah, g'head and use it.)

      I'm all the way on the other side of America, looking after some family business.    There are no direct flights between Eugene OR and Wheeling WV, so I've spent lots of time in the air, and even more time at airports.    I have encountered a flood of insights and reflections that I'm trying to render into "bloggable" form.    First things first.

      So after having my hoarse voice treated four times I called the DoH-WMCA*. They said, under the Rangel clause, they can't reimburse my lost union wages. The nerve! This universal healthcare sucks, man.  *Department of Healthcare for White Middle-Class Americans    Update:  Department of Healthcare - DoH! Hehehe.

      What a sob story. A bright, loving teacher accidentally falls on a needle one day and is hooked on meth.   Why do I reserve the right to attack the dead? No disrespect intended to Anderson's situation, but he was  my daughter's frickin' teacher,  and he did a lousy job.     Deputy Lane County District Attorney Debra Vogt said Anderson "had a really good life going" until he started using methamphetamine.  He lost his job, and his home quickly became "a shambles."  He was a respected teacher  before he left the profession early this year.   Um, no he wasn't. I didn't respect him - he was amazingly unorganized and completely ineffectual, and now I find out he was a piece of trash drug addict. My daughter would tell us about what she did at school, and sometimes I thought she would have learned more staying home with her Game Boy. Our concerns were made known to the school administration throughout the year by parents who volunteered and worked at the school. No surprise that no action was taken until the following year, at which time Anderson was put on some sort of teacher improvement program. Guess it should have included a UA.   Sure, my opinion of Anderson built this post, but whom are you going to listen to? A member of the community he was supposed to provide a service to, or the County DA who knows Anderson as file #305872? I'm not alone in this opinion - my wife reminded me last night that she was lamenting with another parent about Anderson's lousy teaching, where she said "Either he's on drugs, or needs to be." Damn, the wife was right again.     Anderson's parents, Dan and Marilyn Anderson, said Aaron Anderson was drawn to people who were down on their luck and  was perhaps a little too trusting . But he didn't deserve to die, they said.  Don't make me post  urlLink the sign .  " Aaron will never be able to receive help.  We know he could have risen above the problem," Marilyn Anderson said. They asked for a maximum sentence, which is 20 months under Oregon sentencing guidelines.   Help? How 'bout a grain shovel full of 'you're an idiot for using drugs and trying to be employed to teach second graders'? Ignorance cannot be the plea here - you work in the  public school system .   Anyone know if there is any money spent on drug education in public schools these days? Anyone? Maybe lack of funding  is  a major concern for public education. Well, I gotta get over to the progressive party's sign-up list. Maybe we can get a program in place to have kids say no to drugs.   Moral of the story: Be skeptical as hell, especially when your kids are involved.

      Yeah, most of the posts lately (ALL of the coherent ones anyway) have been Bob's. I've got work, school registration and the associated schedule juggling, the kids including new baby, family visiting from half a country away...   Waitaminit. Who are you again?   Heh. Let's just say there hasn't been a whole bucket of goodies to scorn in the local news lately. Courthouse woes seemed to have been solved, as construction has begun. Goodie. More surface area for protests.   I hope to get some posts in here and there. Once school begins in the fall, I have a feeling I'll be spending some time tearing apart the jr. NYT that is the opinion dept. of the OSU Barometer. One such asshat had an article advocating abortion as a means of population control, likening the world's growing population to time-lapse photography of mold encompassing a loaf of bread. Now, I can't speak for this particular fellow, but we're not  all  as dumb as mold.

      Our local air purity gerbils are considering getting tough with a treated wood producer.   urlLink It seems they've logged hundreds of complaints (from the same 13 neurotics) about "odors" emanating from the plant.    The plant's been there since WWII, so I doubt people didn't notice when they built their houses near it.    Somebody hold me back.

       urlLink Good stuff from Mark Steyn.   Here's a bit:   The senator is a classic geopolitical metrosexual: what matters is how you look to the other metrosexuals. Had President Kerry been in office on 9/11, I’ve no doubt there would have been far more UN resolutions, and joint declarations, and beaming faces announcing great progress at Nato summits, and G8, and EU and Apec. But Saddam would still be in power, and so would the Taleban, and no doubt in the latter case, under an agreement brokered by Kerry special envoy Jimmy Carter, Washington would be bankrolling the regime in return for ‘pledges’ to ‘phase out’ the terrorist training camps. The senator gives no indication that he’s up to the challenges of the age.    Not much here that hasn't been said or implied before, but the style of writing is better than most.
