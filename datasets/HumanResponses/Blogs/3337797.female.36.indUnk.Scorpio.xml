      Weird coincidence, I just started reading a book of short stories by Fiona Kidman,  A Needle in the Heart  and the title story starts off in Taumarunui.  The railway which runs through the town is like another character.  I was out of the house early this morning to attend a post-budget breakfast organised by the Child Poverty Action Group - some analysis of what was in the budget for low income families and a chance for major networking.  General consensus that it was a start but not much for the 'poorest' families.  The government's rhetoric is centred around getting people into work, incentives for working in the form of an "in-work payment (tax credit), subsidising child care to entice more women into the work force.  Yes - it's official!  Staying home to care for your children is now a life-style option.  Plenty of help for families where both parents 'work', but the rest of us lay-abouts, wasting our time bringing up children, must lie in our own well-made beds.

      So here I am in Taumarunui again. ( say it toe-ma-roo-noo-e )   Not literally - my dad was with the railway and we all caught the first jigger out of there when I was two and went to live in Hamilton. (That's another story altogether).    It's more like a Taumarunui state of mind.  I'm a full time mother and it's a place nobody goes anymore.  It used to be a major stop on the main-trunk line of life, now most people just see it through the window as they speed by.  And only us life-stylers choose to live here.

      I did a quick grocery shop this afternoon at Foodtown; we needed milk, fresh fruit and veg, biscuits, cereal - the usual.&nbsp; I was playing that game, you know the one where you look at people's trolleys and try to work out what kind of people they are from what they are buying.&nbsp; There was the old lady in the queue in front of me with half a cabbage, a packet of rice and 6 tins of cat food, there was the couple&nbsp; velcroed together&nbsp;behind me with three bottles of wine and a packet of timtams.&nbsp; And there was me with my foodtown card at the ready, making sure I got all the discounts, sending off my details into the ether so some analyst could categorise me as a female family shopper (high spend, aspirational) and tailor coupons for wine and spaghetti sauce and anti-wrinkle cream to send me in the mail.

      by telling people you're a full time mother.  I have had the dubious privilege recently of hosting a couple of work related social events for my husband.  I never really thought I'd end up as a corporate wife but here I am, handing around trays of 'nibbles' and refreshing people's wine glasses and hovering on the edges of conversations about real estate and good schools and caterers.    This is a typical kiwi thing, but the men all head outdoors at the earliest possible moment for a smoke (read "to talk about work") and the women talk about the accommodations they have had to make in their lives to accommodate their partner's careers, oh and curtains.  And if you happen to mention you're a mother at home nobody talks to you at all.  I find myself doing this ludicrous thing where I say, yeah I'm a mum and I do a bit of freelance writing just to keep my brain working, ha ha.

      but I’m only just starting to realise how political even the smallest actions are, particularly relating to the way we raise children.  Breast or bottle-fed?  Working mother, full-time mum, or full-time dad?  Play-centre, day-care or kindergarten?  Private school, catholic or public?  Your choices tell so much about you and your take on life.   Two examples from my nephew’s 4th  birthday party.     I was discussing kindergartens with my sister’s friend.  I guess I just assumed her kids went to public kindy (nominally free in New Zealand although most people pay a small donation for each session) and I was bemoaning the endless fundraising required to keep them afloat.  I’ve been heavily involved in the kindergarten my kids went to and it’s a constant grind to bring in enough money to cover basic costs and very difficult to recruit people to help.  Then, I added, I didn’t know how public kindergartens could survive in their current form.  The session times are not geared for working families and there are long waiting lists.  However, this woman’s kids had both been to a private kindergarten.  No problem about session times, short waiting lists, great flexibility for working parents, minimal parental involvement.  Best of all, they had a highly structured programme which really suited her son because if left to his own devices in a public kindy he would have chosen to play the whole time.  At this point my hackles stood on end.  I happen to believe that play is a child’s work.  Kids have a whole life-time of sitting still and doing what is expected ahead of them, let them hang out in the sand-pit as long as possible.  I may not totally agree with the way public kindergarten is administrated (and I’m sure it will have to adapt to the changes in society) but I fully support the educational philosophy behind it.  Public kindergartens provide fantastic experiences for little children – particularly for families on low incomes who could not otherwise afford preschool education – and that is something to treasure.  (My daughter also spent a year at a private kindy while on the waiting list for our local kindy – it was exclusively white, well-off kids and hardly reflective of our vibrant, multi-cultural community.)  The second conversation was about birthday parties - my sister was bemused by a conversation she’d had with some other women about over-the-top kid’s parties.  These wowserish women felt kids birthday parties had turned into a competitive sport and only encouraged kids to expect elaborate entertainment and enormous party bags.    “But what’s wrong with giving the kids a great time?” asked my sister.  “I like doing it for them.”  Hard to answer that when your kids are having the time of their life enjoying the fruits of her creativity and hard labour at a completely OTT 4 year old's pirate party.  It will sure be hard to top next year though.
