      Lost the feeling..  Never to remember the past..  Waiting for the 'new' day to come..  Remember the bad and good..  To cry or not to..  Promises are meant to be broken..  Most important thing in our life is to be happy..  No matter what happened..  Must always be happy..  And smile..  That people will follow you and smile..  To see the smile that open our heart..  And forget everything..

      Hmm.. About yesterday.. Got headache because of sleep. In school, Stella didn't come to school then I went and sat her seat with Amanda they all.. Then next lesson, i went back to my own seat as SUCKY Mr Low sure will ask me to go back to sit my own seat if i sit at Stella seat then Amanda they all told me 'Bu hui la~! Come come!' ZzZz.. The truth is they want to play with me then i no need to study liao.. Haha~ During English lessons, SUCKY Low didn't ask me to go back (so good~).. And yup.. Broke the rule again.. Eating bread in class.. =x Hmm.. After school, went to canteen makan with a lot of girls.. After makan, Lydia and me went to MRLC to find Mr Yap for money.. He gave us $10 and we went to West Mall supermarkets to buy something to make sushi.. Spent about $10 plus.. Haha~ Can lehz.. $10 can buy a lot of sushi things just like the Happy Fish show on channel 8.. Whahaha! =P  After bought, we went to Lydia's house to put those foods we bought.. Then went back to school again.. DAMN HOT while walking sia! >.> Then we faster walk to school.. My face was red hot while going back to class then Miss Tham scolded me.. Damn Miss Tham la! My uniform never tuck in also not purposely.. Just came back and she scolded.. Then Lydia and me laughing~  After tutorial, i was kind of sick.. Not so pain and pain.. Then went home with Lydia..  Keep calling so many times for Lydia.. She called Stella then never pick my calls.. ZzZzz.. Went downstair and supposed want to go her house but when i called one more time, she pick already.. Zzzz.. She went my house because we are making sushi~! ^^ Erm.. First time make foods together with friend at home.. =p And first time making sushi.. When i'm the first one to fold the sushi, she was so happy.. -.-l Then we make 7 different of foods inside the sushi.. Not every sushi is delicious or whatever.. But one thing that i can confirm is there are other sushi outside better than our sushi.. =x  I called Lion to come my house at around 8pm plus and i gave him a container of 10 sushi while Mr Yap, 9 sushi.. I gave Lion isn't what you are thinking.. His mum make the sushi then Lion shared it with me.. Then Lydia and Lion went home together.. Told Lion to see Lydia home first as it's dangerous for a girl to go home alone but then Lion don't listen.. Then Lydia called me and say Lion bullied her.. Zzzz.. Because Lion don't want to go to school with Lydia to give the sushi to Mr Yap.. I don't quite believe Lydia as she say Mr Yap is still in school at this late time.. o.O Mr Yap really at school ma? Don't care.. Then don't know whether Lion got pei Lydia not..  To be continue ...

      Suckz! >.>     urlLink      You are Green Lion, who gives graceful and pure impression.       You are dignified, and possess delicate sensitivity and cool intelligence along side your sweetness.      But unlike your friendly outlook, you are very cautious towards others, and can not relax in front of anyone.       Your weakness is that you can not adapt easily to new environments.      You tend to take a very passive attitude when starting something.       But when it comes nearer towards the goal, you become very obstinate, and your ego will start to show up.      You may become very dogmatic, but because of your personality, people will not feel harmed.       You possess a skill of a manager, and even if you experience difficulty, you don't show grimness.      You are very practical and precise person.       You can make sound and rational decisions, but sometimes can be argumentative.      In life, you are long distance runner type.       You treasure your past and find something from there.       You will have your best days in old age.      You are not so emotional type, and therefore look much older than your actual age.       You should not think things according to your own interest.       Your reliable character is trusted by people around you.       After getting married you may turn out a little nagging type.       But will be a good wife and a mother.

       Oh well.. I'm typing about my homework which that SUCKY Mr Low asked us to do last Friday then till now, I haven't do.. Haha..! Okok~! I will type it down then copy to my exercise book!  My favourite food is curry aka laksa. Curry is the type that got soup (orange colour), hot (chill) and many foods. I like curry because I like to eat hot foods. When I was young, my mum cooked curry almost every the Saturday. And when I  'm sleeping while she is cooking, I would quick woke up, forgot about sleeping more, brush my teeth and see her cooking curry. Or went to market with her to buy vegetables, potato, chickens, coconut and something else that need for curry..! I remember when I was young, I helped to peel the vegetables for mum to cook curry..! =P  My mum cook the curry is the  BEST  and  DELICIOUS ! Her curry is the most  DELICIOUS  and  WONDERFUL  I've even taste in my life. =P The curry ingredients have.. Coconut, vegetables, chickens, potato, water, tofu and the chill something. Plus! The rice noodles (My favourite noodles)! =P  I eat curry at home..! I would eat for three to five bowls a day! Haha! My mum always cooks the curry on the  BIG  pot! That her, me, sister and brother can finish the  BIG  pot a day or the left over will save on tomorrow.  I don't think that all my friends had even taste my mum's curry before. Because.. she cook are for me, brother, sister and herself and not for friends or other people! So i feel sorry~ =)  ~The End~ Thanks For SUCKY Mr Low
