      Interactive advertising. They pretend it is a game, let you 'shoot the monkey' or 'push the ball up' or 'avoid the clouds', but soon enough you'll be redirected to an advertisement. Close the annoying pop-up box, push the back button or race to the stop button and you'll get to keep playing, hoping that the javascript or whatever other programming they've used doesn't restrict you from playing it twice.  Most of the time these addictive games are better than anything the website with the add has or the website that is advertising has. They are often a lot better than that freeware game you spent 10 hours downloading last night, but you don't want to admit it. Refresh the page and you'll lose the ad and be going back to playing the freeware game, hoping that the computer doesn't perform the 400th illegal error in weeks.  But there are those that stay.  urlLink Prime TV  is an example of one which, if you press the stop button just before it redirects, can allow you to keep bouncing balls. Just press the balls, and they'll rise. Then try to get them all up. And if that gets you, you're probably a kiwi who watches Aussie programs in prime time.  OK, maybe waiting to download freeware isn't that bad.

      Many media outlets today seek only monetary gain and ignore their social responsibilities. The greatest offenders are Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which provides a very conservative bias as a media conglomerate, and Viacom, which provides many poor quality programmes aimed at young audiences through its MTV brand.  Major media corporations and conglomerates seek money from their operations above all else. They loose their political neutrality and moral standard from this selfish desire to make every cent they possibly can.  Canada's CanWest has taken advantage of deregulation here in New Zealand, purchasing a large proportion of New Zealand's radio and television stations. They have tried to control local radio station content from Auckland to get a result that is best commercially, and in the process ignored the importance these radio stations have on local culture.  The commercialised evening news in New Zealand that Dr Edwards criticises so very much is, according to him, the result of deregulation. I have to say there is credit in this: if it was not the cause, then it was atleast a contributing factor.  The BBC, Australian ABC, PBS and NPR are perfect examples of public broadcasting services providing quality programmes under limted commercial influence. I believe that major commercially-orientated media companies could do a similar service and still recieve significant financial gain.

      New Zealand celebrity  urlLink Paul Holmes  almost lost his job with  urlLink his "cheekie darkie" comments   urlLink last year . In recent weeks, however, the spotlight has once again been on his behaviour and loud mouth.  This time he wasn't giving anti-female or anti-Black comments on his radio show, but instead chose to  urlLink name New Zealand Maaori MP Tariana Turia to a "bag of lard"  and shoo off children on a special prime-time screening of a sheep (named Shrek) which made  urlLink CNN World News Headlines .  Lack of non-Iraq-related  urlLink news  aside, we now know  urlLink Paul Holmes  is an anti-Black, anti-female, anti-children and anti-overweight activist. He's probably the most controversial broadcaster in Holland's history, Australia, Britain and Austria didn't keep him and only New Zealanders are stupid enough to purchase his album.  It really makes me think...

      ZM, a New Zealand radio station, purchased radio simulcast rights to the 'National Anthem' New Zealand music marathon, that was screening on television 2.  It was constantly advertised in 30 second promos, live reporters and repeats of the four venues. The radio promo went as follows:  121 bands. 24 hours. 4 cities. And TV2 is live there with ZM. National Anthem is held at the St James in Auckland, Avalon in Wellington, Canterbury Uni in Christchurch and Otago Uni in Dunedin...  Overall, in the 24 hours there was about 70 minutes dedicated to advertising and promoting the National Anthem live on ZM, including raving about the 121 bands. In reality, only about 3 bands were broadcast taking about 25 minutes of the air time.  Meanwhile, something far more important gained under 10 minutes worth of promotion over the same 24 hour period...  This week on The Crew: On Monday Janet Jackson joins the crew. [Clip]Hello is this Janet Jackson[Clip]. Janet Jackson on the crew. Monday on ZM.  Perhaps the station, which is a Clear Channel and Australian Provincial Newspapers joint-venture and plays 'Today's Hit Music' is really just a bunch of Zany Madness...  Maybe it never recovered after Paul Holmes was Disc Jocky at the radio station during the 1970's...
