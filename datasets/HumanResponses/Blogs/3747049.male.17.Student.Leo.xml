      Its slowly getting hotter as I finally begin to feel Britains wrath of heat. Aparently the heat wave is supposed to be now and I have to say it is getting hotter. More stickyness and sweatyness :/ thats not good.....I need a air con, but if I got a air con id use it about 1 month and turn it off for the other 11 :p. This heats causing nose bleeds....not the best thing to have in the morning :/ its getting extremly annoying and getting it to stop wastes much time, if this doesnt stop ill most likly bleed to death in my own bathroom, for my sake I hope not. God I hate the heat! I just cant wait for autumn to come again with its cooling winds and its autmn leaves!  I cant sleep. This summer my sleeping times are really bad. Ive turned nocturnal as I sleep around 3am-6am and wake up between 2pm-5pm. Its bad and if I was at school this would be even worse! Still I hope to fix this naturally or if not ill have to resort to using sleeping tablets like Nytol or something. Is this callsed as insomnia perhaps? I think insomnias when you have a disturbed sleep pattern but once im asleep im pretty much out like a log....still insomnia by Feeder is a nice song! :p  In other news I was watching the F1 and J.Button drove a very good race in the Geramn GP last weekend. From 13th on the grid to 2nd was a pretty impressive drive and his battle with F.Alonso was one of the more entertaining moments of the season along with Monaco where he battled it out with J.Trulli. Still the race was dampened by the fact that K.Raikkonen lost his rear wing causing him to slam into the tyre wall and that meant he couldnt challenge M.Shumacher for the win, such a shame. 3 week break from F1 now only 1 week in and I cant wait till the next race at Hungry. Ofcourse you guys maybe dont watch the F1 and you guys havnt got a clue what im talking about. In which case ignore me! :p  So my friend wants me to go see a live band. Ofcourse hes sorta pushing me to go see any band -_- Which I cant be bothered to do. I think Ill go see a band I might be somewaht intrested in :p He asked me to go see Avenged Sevenfold but they are a bit too gothic for my liking and I dont seem to take to the whole idea of mosh pits where people just smack into each other? hmm I should have got a ticket to see Snow Patrol :/ but then again the hardcore music fans would probably call my tatse it musis diabolical. But atleast I aint going around claiming to love boybands which is worse.  My exam results will be out in august and im worried I do believe i messed a few exams up and it cant be helped. Just hope god and maybe lady luck is on my side. I hope they are. But before exam results its my birthday soon. Its actually coming sooner then I thought and ill be another day closer to death. Im so cynical, the glass is half empty the glass is half full whatever psychological babble that is. I need some more friends to celebrate stuff with. Never seem to have a ample supply of friends :/ :(  And this draws to a close this long blog full of doo lally nonsense. If you made it to the end without falling asleep I salute you for you are a true warrior :p Dont have nightmares now.

       So as we are doing the DIY we took a trip to Ikea our favourite Swedish furniture store! I really hate going slowly around the place but it was worth it eat their Swedish meatballs, their speciality. So after that everyone else peruses for about 4 hours while I get somewhat bored. Finally we made our way out to the warehouse to get the furniture half is the stuff isn’t in stock. Ahhh! Thats so rubbish! Still we managed to get half a shelf, a draw and cupboard which has a gap in between the doors which I can’t seem to work out how to fix. Also a new computers chair which im sitting on now. It has hydraulics! I hope I don’t get too tempted to just play around with it like we use to in school :p In typical Ikea fashion absolutely everything is flat packed and we spent a good few hours assembling the stuff and it wasn’t pretty. Holes that were not aligned, screws which were too tight, instructions which were written by dummies who must have numbered the instructions wrong. Ikea = STRESS. I say all thats good about Ikea is its meatballs, you can forget the furniture just go eat the meatballs hahaha :p to add to this day of stress we have to take back some items as they are the wrong size, well was our fault I suppose but I don’t find the though of having to go back to the hell hole that is Ikea again -_-*.  &nbsp;  So tomorrow, more painting, more sanding. Sounds good.....

       So today my sister and her boyfriend Carl came round to help to do some DIY. After previous experiences of painting and how much hassle it is I am not really looking forward to my mums nagging. So first stop is to sand down the skirting boards! Now if you have ever used a sander you would know how much effort you have to put into it. It’s like having a dog on a leash that’s trying to run away! How annoying and after a while your hands are like jelly and you will have a hard time feeling anything for the next 20mins. -_-* Anyways the painting \o/ which was simple enough yet more and more coats of paint. So far we have done 6 coats of paint in 3 rooms. And all ive had to eat today is bread! Still at least there was a nice curry waiting for me at the end of the day.   So apart from painting ive been spending the past few days of my summer holidays playing Max Payne 2 and im already on Part 3 and getting close to the end. I really like making use of bullet time to kill my opponents! Eat my bullets vlad wahahahaha!!!!!   The 500 or S60? hmmm What do these numbers mean?!?! Well they are the names of canon digital cameras! I’m thinking of finally getting a digital camera for me to tinker with and ive decided ill go with canon as they are the best but im sorta torn between the Ixus 500 and the powershot S60.  I suppose it depends on the size of the wallet :p.   Ok enough of my yapping im sure you have something better to do! Adios kids.

       Its 4:05am! Cant sleep, nothing unusual there.... So anyways I have a voucher for a free music CD im wondering what to spend it on. Snow Patrol, Keane or maybe The Streets? I think ill just go and take Snow Patrol same sorta stuff as Coldplay roughly.      F1 is back! yay the only entertainment I can rely on for a weekend :p It seems everyones talking about how Jenson Button has made a shock move to return to WialliamsF1 and ditching BAR. I think this has tarnished his appearence and I dont support him as fully as I did before this. Some say hes a traitor but only when BAR and WilliamsF1 go to court will we ever get to hear the full story and if I find that Button moved for money then that would be even worse.  I got a model of his car for this year, its very detailed and limited to 3000, its 1:43 in scale but you can even read the name of the driver, really amazing I cant see this being done by hand..      This summer has been nothing but sleeping and soon ill have to go pick up my A level results which will be a mixed bag of goodies. Full of joy and pain. Atleast ill be able to share it with the very little friends I have left. Must remember to try and make more friends somehow someway within the next 3 years.....if I dont who will i rely on and who will I talk to? Ill end up talking to myself and drinking alone. Uh oh its a bit premature for that I wasnt expecting to do that till im 50. lol.      And for thos intrested the quote is from Travis. And well it rained on my birthday :p      And this is the end my friends. I have nothing left to say.   So goodbye!

       Im 17! Another year older. Another year closer to death as they say. Great stuff! :P  So where are my presents :) hehehe  And look this test is strangly accurate.....      My inner child is sixteen years old!  Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink  How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by   urlLink  Quizilla
