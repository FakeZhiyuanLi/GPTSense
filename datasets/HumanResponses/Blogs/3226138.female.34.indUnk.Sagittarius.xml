       urlLink    This is now the 3-D image of the houseplan, right-front view...  urlLink    viewed from left-front...  urlLink    viewed from left-back...  urlLink    and viewed from right-back. I made a revision of that to include a porch and a sunroom, as well as a deck with pool, with some changes in the rooms; however, the actual thing came out with the rooms as laid out in this first plan. And though we are about to add the porch, deck and sunroom, at this point in time, the house resembles these 3-D renditions.

      Allow me to start with the design of our house. I used the Punch program (Auto CADD) to design it. These photos show the floorplan. Click on the photos to get a larger view.   urlLink         urlLink     This was the plan as of the date posted (July 2003). The next posts will be the 3-D image from several angles.

      Wow! This is a real cool way to document how I built our present house! (And I am still working on it...). My wife is so smart (she's the one who discovered this!). Now I can sit down every night, post a picture, and work my way daily into documenting the whole process...A perfect way to relax...

       urlLink    This was the garage then (Sept 2003)...  urlLink    Some materials that we needed elsewhere were placed in the garage in the meantime...  urlLink    Gary working on the pipes leaving the furnace...At the back part is the oil burner. He was preparing for winter then. He was about to build the furnace room.  urlLink    The furnace room was done in time for winter. It contains now not only the oil burner but also the tank for the firewood (the furnace), plus our upright freezer in which we stock our year-long supply of beefcuts.

      When we finally came here, the roof has been installed. In the past days it had been very hot, but the moment we stepped onto this land, it suddenly became very cold! We had to use several sheets of blankets to keep us warm. During those first few days we had no insulation yet. We only had a makeshift bathroom and toilet, no kitchen sink.  urlLink    from west...  urlLink    the back of the house. Two French doors facing the same spot where we plan to place a deck and a pool...one opens up to the master bedroom, the other to the living room...  urlLink

      This is now the living room, the side that faces the back part of our house, sometime in aug 2003. I love the french doors opening to the same spot where the FD of our master bedroom opens too (in the future, there will be a deck there, leading to an elevated pool). &lt;br&gt;br&gt;The kids used the area as their sleeping space initially. (The second floor had no partitions yet, and there was no stairway going up at the time.)  urlLink    This was the side that faced the front and the west end of the house then. Noticeable here is the absence of insulation (it was Fall).  urlLink    Then later, Gary put up the insulation on the ceiling, using the staging to reach it...  urlLink    I continued with the insulation (it kept me busy during those boring winter days) on the walls. Then Gary put this furnace in place (for additional heat. The furnace in the garage is the main heat generator.)  urlLink    Then Gary worked on adding the plastic sheeting running from the ceiling down to the walls.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

IF not, we would have had to hire another person to do it (which we can't afford at the moment), yet I don't like the feeling of paranoia that gets into me when something like this is done by another person. What if he does not do it right? What if he overcharged? Anything can go wrong...I feel so secure with Gary on these things and I am so grateful for having him for my husband...&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      The past weekend Gary started working on the sidings of the house (something which is best done while it is still summer - warm and dry outside). For a starter, he had to establish lines as guide to make sure that the bottom-most sidings are placed at the same level. He used an optical level to mark the points with my aid (I marked them down with a pencil, then he drove a nail on those points).  urlLink    While I squat here waiting for his cue, I took a shot of him peeking through the optical level  urlLink    This is the optical level...at first I thought it was a videocam of some sort! Haha!...ignorant me...  urlLink    It had some calibrations like in a microscope, with a tiny bubble that had to be centered to determine the level. When one takes a peek, there are crossed hairlines that point at that spot where I would make the mark. We made several marks on corners  of the house, at least two points at each surface to make a line. What a wonderful gadget!  urlLink    After all the preparations of marking, as well as putting the trims around the garage doors and the corner molding (all plastic molding came with the sidings - totalled $5000 when Gary purchased them last year), here now is Gary&#39;s first siding in place. Tadah!!!  urlLink    By the end of the day, this is what Gary had finished putting up. Beautiful!...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Gary wanted that vinyl siding, as well as tin roof and our windows and doors, for a maintenance-free house!)  urlLink     Posted by  urlLink Hello

      I got these flowers from the plants shown on the ground below, almost as high as the feet. One plant consists of 2 leaves and a bunch of flowers like this. They have a very nice scent, I bet they can be used as perfume! I picked several of them (a lot hidden underneath the leaves, almost as if they want to kiss the earth), together with some other flowers from other weeds or trees and placed them in a vase.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Update: My friend's mom told me it was Lily of the Valley...then the next day I saw it on magazine for sale! This morning, I dug out a bunch of them (they were located under the big tree that stood as one of the "guards at the entry point to our driveway) and transplanted them to our garden. Prior to that I tilled the soil in one spot of our lawn where there are small trees and lots of grass around them, along with a stump. I figured it would be better to put them there because they might probably need the shade. I will see tomorrow if they will overcome the initial shock...

      Here is another cluster of plants being invaded by sprouts of another flower plant. If I would not remove these, soon they would kill this particular cluster and dominate my whole flower garden! (I could only compare them to the greedy colonizer, wanting all the [soil's] resources for their use, regardless of wiping out the other flowerplant [the colonized]. Too bad, the colonized do not really have a rescuer, unlike these plants which I am rescuing...But this brought a conflict to me. I would, as much as possible, want to leave nature as is...letting Darwin's "survival of the fittest" principle at work...But well, I want to enjoy the beauty of these flowers [a wonderful artwork by God!]...)  urlLink

      Today we worked on the vegetable garden. I called Mom early this morning to ask her how to do it (should I plant it the same way I did with the onions?). She said it would be easier to show than to tell the instructions on the phone, but that she just had to attend to her laundry. During that time, I went out to start with my flower garden. The kids helped me.  urlLink    Finally Mom came and instead of just showing me how to plant potatoes, she started tilling the land with the backhoe, touching the areas nearest the planted onions and spinach. She said I should deter the weeds from establishing their roots at least every two weeks.   urlLink     Later Dad also came and rotatilled the aread where we would plant the potatoes becauce the soild had gotten so hard (Mom said it was like granite!). The kids all helped in picking up rocks. Mom and I picked up lossened grass and weeds to throw them away into the field.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Mom saw a big nightcrawler and asked Juliana to pick it up and set it at a corner of the garden to avoid crushing it with the rotatiller.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Then we planted the potatoes. The seeds should be planted deep (about 5 inches from topsoil) and about 1 foot apart from one another (Dad said so they would produce big tubers). Patrick also tried to do it. It's nice to have my in-laws teaching me about their ways AND teaching my kids as well...Adult models are critical in a child's formation of his/her values, and I certainly can't be the lone model especially for the boys. Like what Mom said, it takes at least two to do the parenting, a female and a male, to be the role models in the normal development of an individual. And I agree...

      When Ana's mom came to meet me, we discovered something in common: the liking for plants and gardening. Though I am quite a newbie in this field, we enjoyed taking a short walk the second meeting we had, to dig up some more plants from the roadside. This is a columbine already with flowers that I have transplanted into my flower garden...  urlLink    Taken from the ant's perspective, the unique feature of this flower is the spiked petals, the purpose of which I will never guess. Ana's mom said that the hummingbirds are particularly attracted to them. Maybe the spiked petals serve as water reservoir (and probably the flowers have a chemical added to it that makes it sugary) which the hummingbirds drink.  urlLink

      It's Saturday, and the day is sunny...perfect for transplanting the seedlings!  urlLink    These are tomato seedlings. Note the yellowish leaves. Coupled with roots extending way far beyond the pots, Mom said it signifies insufficient nutrients from the soil, and that the plant needed badly to be transplanted from their tiny pots to a garden bed.|  urlLink    Aside from tomatoes we also transplanted bell peppers. Then we sowed the seeds of cucumbers (which needed a lot of space because they creep over the whole area!), beet greens, and carrots. Later that day, Ann came and gave us their excess corn seedlings.  urlLink

      Columbine (Aquilegia caerulea) taken at dusk...Notice the gentle curving of its spikes.  urlLink    Buttercups are wild flowers with petals that are shiny they seem to have been laminated, and  with small and sparse foliage on tall slender stems. They abound everywhere, even on the field, but I let them thrive on my flower garden because of their beauty. I pick them up almost everyday to put in my flower vase.   urlLink    Lupine at the early days of blooming...the clusters of florets that are crabclaw-shaped start blooming from the bottom upward. The foliage show stellate formation. I think they re-sow themselves. I have seen several isolated plants in other parts of my garden.  urlLink    California bluebells is my guess for these lovely dainty flowers in groups of two at every stem, with stellate-shaped foliage as well. I saw an isolated plant also in the flowering stage interspersed with daisies, so I figure it is also self-sowing. Next time I won't pull any weedlooking plants off my garden until 2nd week of June.  urlLink    Another variety of Columbine (Aquilegia caerulea) with striking contrast of red orange-yellow petals, this time the spikes are not curved but straight, the blooms slightly larger and more open than in the previously-shown purple variety (A. vulgaris). Foliage is clearly shown here, but I can't think of a way to describe it (seeing is better anyway.)  urlLink    Daisies are everywhere...very wild, with scarce small pointed leaves in a sturdy single stalk. They grow in clusters. The petals are so delicate.  urlLink    Petunias (P. drummondii) from my generous mother-in-law...clusters of small flowers either in solid or combination of colors, with stiff stems and simple foliage...  urlLink    I don't know what this is...The plant is just about 6-8 inches high (it is an annual) with uninteresting foliage, but the flower has several layers of petals in red-white combination...so striking...  urlLink    Another unkown flower clusters of delicate pink, the individual florets about 1-2 inches big/long, unscented, grows in  a bush (perennial).&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Pansy common name for any of a family of plants having large showy flowers composed of five leafy sepals, five to ten petals, numerous stamens, and two to five carpels, each with numerous round, black, shiny seeds. The leaves are compound, the leaflets variously and irregularly divided. The fibers of the root are often thickened and tuberous. Peony species are large herbaceous perennials or, rarely, half-shrubby plants, native to Europe, Asia, and the northwestern United States. Because of the beauty of their flowers, some species are cultivated, particularly the common peony, a native of the mountain woods of southern Europe. This species has carmine or blood-red flowers. A variety with double flowers is common. The white peony is another favorite garden species. The mountain peony in favorable circumstances may attain large size and a height of about 4 m (about 12 ft). It is propagated by cuttings and also by grafting.  Scientific classification: Peonies make up the family Paeoniaceae. The common peony is classified as Paeonia officinalis, the white peony as Paeonia lactiflora, and the mountain peony as Paeonia moutan.

Taraaaa!&nbsp; urlLink    UPDATE as of Jul 16: I noticed that the flowers did not open the next day; instead, it continued to wilt, while the other flowers in the bunch slowly opened and bloomed on the 2nd day after the first set.

Patrick likes them very much.)  urlLink    A short row of cucumbers (on the right) and 3 rows of sweet corn...The kids helped me weed the garden this morning!  urlLink    These are 4 tomatillo plants with lots of flowers already (tomatillos are a variety of tomatoes used in making salsa).  urlLink    2 rows of onions. (I use some leaves for flavoring dips and dressings, esp. patis and vinegar, also in soups and arroz caldo.)  urlLink    Andy peppers (already with BIG fruits -- good for pickling). I also have some jalapeño ones.  urlLink    Beets (green leaves will be ready for harvesting probably by next week). I will have to leave some widely spaced apart for the tuber to grow some more.  urlLink    I have two half-rows of carrots.

       urlLink    Just recently Gary dug a trench to place the powerline (the old line was so far from the house now that he suspected it was consuming more energy just because of additional length; this new one is a shorter course). The trench now covered with dirt, he planned to sow grass seeds because it just looked -- well, plain.  I had a different idea. I turned the path into a walkway. I placed slates   which I dug up from under the gravel near the house (the previous garden reached the house; got burned during the fire). Still halfway through the project...  urlLink    So this pathway leads to the vegetable garden (where currently we have our cheap pool).&nbsp; urlLink

      These are 3 plants that were growing outside of my flower garden (i.e., with the other wild plants around). Gary said they might have been sowed from last year's flowerplants (which were destroyed by the fire). The left most smaller plants had striking fuschia-colored flowers. The tall rightmost plant according to my friend Bingbing said it is a tobacco kind of plant. She gave this tip: transplant flower plants AFTER they are done blooming. (Actually that is what my husband and in-laws say too, but I am quite impatient I just wanted to try to transplant them now. If they die, then I will try to watch out for the young shoots in next year's spring. If they live, well and good. AT least I tried...hehehe...)&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      A forumer in asawa.org wanted some insight from Filipinas about their first winter experience. One suggestion I gave was to have a dark surface on which to catch snowflakes when the snow falls. He said it was new to him...so I am posting here some quite blurry yet clear enough to see such snowflakes. Best to catch them at a time when snow falls thinly (if they fall in clumps, they'll melt before you even get to see the individual flakes).  urlLink    (CLICK on the photos to see larger images) These are snowflakes caught the moment it starts snowing, with the surrounding air cold enough to not melt them while they descend. The snowmobile seat is still not fully covered with snow so it makes the individual flakes distinct enough to see the hexagonal pattern.  urlLink

      Peanut butter is an American tradition. Peanut butter provides vitamins, minerals, protein and carbohydrates. Two tablespoons of smooth peanut butter can provide 8 grams of protein, magnesium and phosphorus. It may be higher in fat (16 grams in 2 Tbsp.) than some foods, but consume it in moderation. You can even reduce the fat in recipes by substituting peanut butter for butter.   from My Yahoo

      As I thought of how I should proceed with my mini-project, I was thinking that posting recipes would be slow...about at least 1 per week, perhaps... Then I thought that since my purpose of maintaining this blog is to cover other topics that has to do with nutrition and health aside from cooking and baking, maybe I should post a different topic at least on a per day basis, like.... Monday - Kitchen tips Tuesday - Health and Nutrition Tips Wednesday - Miscellaneous topics Thursday - a recipe for cooking Friday - a recipe for baking Saturday and Sunday will be my days off my blog, because I will dedicate those days to my family. (I do have another non-food blod where I post everything personal). Understandably, my recipes would eat a lot of time because aside from remembering to take photos while cooking/baking (sometimes I ask my sons' help for that), I also have to edit the pics using Adobe PhotoDeluxe to re-size and trim them, then I have to make the actual html document, make the necessary editing on the homepage, and post here about the recipe. Oh I wish I had enough time and energy to study about MT (I downloaded the manual but right now, with spring comes the tons of gardening that I also have to give time to, and I only have til summer to plant and harvest my produce for our own consumption).  I often tell my in-laws that I am overwhelmed with the new things happening to me. Not only am I exposed to heretofore unknown (in its truest sense) phenomenon (like static electricity and hazards of driving during a snowstorm), I am at present constantly adjusting and learning. Whereas in my country of origin, a food easily spoils outside of the fridge, here, with the dryness of the air, I can actually dehydrate pieces of bread and run them in a processor to create my own breadcrumbs! That's handy and more economical than putting them inside the oven to toast. I always come up with white breadcrumbs with that method, and I don't have to worry about fungal growth on the bread. I don't know if the air will be humid enough during spring or summer. I'll see...

      Today is the birth of my foodblog featuring my collection of Filipino recipes as well as American recipes, with kitchen tips and health and nutrition tips. This is linked to my  urlLink kusina  because I am planning to compile recipes that I have tried and liked, in accordance with the blending of Pinoy (me and my kids) and American tastes.   I have been using the internet as a resource for recipes and a ton of other information, food- or non-food related. I have seen websites that featured Filipino cooking, but none yet that featured Filipino cooking as adapted to living in other countries (modified Filipino dishes), which highlight on the cultural blending of the Filipino-American marriages.   Although with the versatility of Pinays in coming up with new ways to cook, as a result of the many influences of other cultures (Oriental as well as Western), most of the recipes I have seen use ingredients unique to the Filipino community.  I am living in an area where I have to travel for 2 hours to get to a Pinoy store. Most often I have to use whatever ingredients are available here. I am new here, and I don't have a license to drive yet. So I don't often get to visit the grocery stores, and if I do, my husband often itches to get out of there quickly. So, until now I haven't fully acquainted myself with what items are available here. And I have yet to learn what the alternatives are to certain ingredients that I have been used to, especially vegetables, since species growing and abundant in the Philippines are remarkably different from those thriving in this area where winter's duration is 5 months!  Anyway, I hope to invite more Filipinas/Filipinos into becoming a part of this recipe compilation. And I hope to help myself and other Pinays/Pinoys in this endeavor, in whatever little way I can, with whatever little talent I can utilize and share. (You have to excuse my ignorance in computers and website creation!).  Here's to a fruitful, tasty and healthy new life!

      This is from My Yahoo:   1) Keep your kitchen full of vegetables that won't spoil quickly -- onions, garlic, potatoes, winter squash, carrots. 2) At a salad bar, fill up your plate with salad greens first. 3) Next time you make pasta with vegetables, use half as much pasta and twice as many vegetables. Bonus tip: Eating out or ordering in tonight? How about a side of broccoli with that? Surveys reveal that when people eat foods prepared outside the home, they average 25% fewer fruits and vegetables -- so make an effort to include vegetables in your order.

      This is from food journalist Mark Bittman. (I have been too busy working on my flower and vegetable gardens  these past two days...no time to think about anything to write about...so I will just offer here some things that I have found useful in running my kitchen.)   You can spend thousands of dollars on kitchen equipment, or you can spend a couple of hundred bucks and be done with it. If you've been lucky enough to inherit hand-me-downs from friends or relatives, you may already have most of what you need.  In any case, it's worth cooking for a while with minimal equipment so that you can determine your priorities. If you bake bread, you will need different equipment than you do for baking cookies; if you make stews, you�ll need different equipment than you will for grilling.  If you cook a lot, ultimately you'll want a lot of equipment, but when you begin there's no way to know that. Think of a beginning artist, who doesn't rush out and buy oils, an easel, brushes, watercolors, pastels, pencils, and so on, but takes it a few things at a time.  With that in mind, here's what I think it's best to start with.   Knives   Knives are the most important cooking expenditure, although not the largest. Buy knives with blades of a high carbon-stainless steel alloy for hardness and durability. A plastic handle is probably preferable to wood, because it isn't damaged by soaking. If you're careful not to let the knife bang around, you can put it in the dishwasher. And if you keep your knives sharp (you'll need a sharpening steel), they'll keep you happy for the rest of your life.  An 8-in (20-cm) chef's knife is the all-purpose blade for chopping and slicing. You can use it even for carving, until you buy a carving knife. It needn't cost more than $30, although you can spend more if you like. Buy one that feels good in your hand, and move to a six-inch or ten-inch knife if your hands are small or large.  A couple of paring knives are necessary for peeling and trimming. Again, buy those that feel good in your hand, but don't spend more than a few dollars on each. And unless you only eat presliced bread, buy a long, sturdy bread knife with a serrated (notched) edge.  That should hold you for a while. When you get a chance, buy a sharpening steel, a boning knife (to remove bones from chicken), and a carving knife (for roasts). You'll never need more than that.  Be aware that dull knives are dangerous. They slip off the food you're cutting and right onto the closest surface, which may be your finger. Although you must be extremely careful with sharp knives'casual contact with the blade cuts, at least they go where you want them to. Respect your knives: Start with good ones, keep them sharp, and they will become your friends.   Pots and pans   Many people are overwhelmed by the choices in pots and pans: cast-iron, nonstick, aluminum, stainless steel, enameled, and copper. But even when money is no object, the most expensive pans are not the best. Many kinds of pans work well, and many of these don't cost much.  Cast iron or heavy-duty steel (a more contemporary equivalent of cast iron) are the best you can do, if you're strong of wrist and don't mind a little heavy lifting. Both are excellent at heat distribution and retention. Clean them correctly with very little soap and these pans become virtually nonstick in a short while.  Enamel-coated cast-iron cookware has many of the qualities of heavy-duty steel or plain cast iron. Many people find the coated cookware more attractive, however, although the enamel eventually discolors, wears, and even chips. Even so, these pots have a classic look and are highly functional.  Nonstick pans are a marvel, and inexpensive cast-aluminum pans with nonstick surfaces are the best bargain in cookware. All restaurants use them simply because they work. They are not especially attractive, but they enable you to cook with no fat if you choose to do so, they clean up in a second, and they�re extremely light in weight. Their disadvantage: Nonstick surfaces don't last long. Cooks wind up replacing these pans every few years.  Stainless steel is highly functional and good looking, although its name is misleading. Stainless steel does in fact stain and it isn't especially easy to retain its high-gloss, chromelike look through the life of the pan. But stainless steel is a good compromise: It's generally not super-expensive, it distributes and retains heat well, and it isn't as heavy as cast iron. And stainless steel with a nonstick surface is, for many people, the best pan of all: Though more expensive than cast aluminum, it's far better looking.  Whatever pans you choose, make sure the handle is ovenproof. Many dishes begin on top of the stove and finish in the oven, and plastic handles can't withstand the heat. For size, start with a pot big enough to cook a pound of pasta (6 qt [6 liters] or larger) and a skillet that can sautee a small, cut-up chicken (about 12 in [30cm] in diameter).   Baking equipment   With two exceptions, baking equipment is unlikely to be essential in your daily cooking. But it's critical when you need it. The exceptions are bowls and a baking sheet.  Bowls are incredibly important, not only for baking but for general cooking. Stainless steel bowls are cheap and durable, if not particularly attractive, but the material is mostly a matter of personal choice. Get a variety of sizes to begin with, and add as you need them.  Tiny ramekins (or custard cups) are really useful for setting aside small amounts of chopped or measured ingredients as you prepare them.  A cookie sheet, best thought of as a baking sheet, is also great for broiling, especially if it has a small lip. Go with aluminum. For most purposes, uncoated will be okay here, but nonstick coating never hurts.  A pie plate or two is something you might want after that; begin with one, 9-in (23-cm) across, made of ovenproof glass. A 10-in (25-cm) springform pan with a removable rim is great for cheesecake. A tart pan with a removable bottom should be an early acquisition if you intend to do serious baking.  Two loaf pans (or none), depending on whether you bake bread, measuring 9 by 5 in (23 by 13 cm) or thereabouts. Nonstick aluminum is best here. Muffin tins of the same material are useful for cupcakes as well as muffins.  I recommend buying cake pans as you need them; otherwise you'll never have the right size. Or pick them up at tag sales as you see them.   Handheld equipment   A cutting board is a must; whether it's of plastic or wood is your choice. Plastic can go in the dishwasher, but wood is more attractive. Because you need more than one, try one of each until you determine your preference. Extremely heavy wood cutting boards are the best, but they also are costly.  To keep your cutting board from sliding around on the counter (annoying, isn't it?), place a damp towel under it.  Wooden spoons are best for cooking; metal ones are best for serving. You can add spatulas, ladles, slotted spoons, and the like as you go along or as you see them.  Metal tongs are the most useful tool for turning food as it cooks, and for removing it from the pan. Get the spring-loaded kind.  A set of measuring spoons and cups, maybe two, is essential. A scale is useful, but most beginners will find it superfluous.  Strainers and colanders can be added as necessary, if you start with a big strainer, which you can use to drain pasta.  Graters are handy, though you can skip a manual grater if you have a food processor. The classic box grater is best among manual graters.  A vegetable peeler, with a u-shape, should be among your first purchases.  A salad spinner is the best tool invented since the food processor. Useful whenever you want to wash and dry almost anything.   Electric appliances   People ask about stoves all the time, but most don't have the money or the time to remodel their kitchen, which is what replacing a stove is usually about. If you have a choice, go with a gas range and an electric oven; if you don't have a choice, don't worry about it; heat is heat.  These are the most important electric appliances:  A food processor is invaluable. It can grate massive amounts of almost anything in seconds; it can make bread dough, pie dough, even some cookie batters in a minute; it can grind meat, make mayonnaise and bread crumbs, puree vegetables, and slice potatoes or almost anything else. Start with a large one, a model that can handle at least 6 cups of batter or dough; you might want a small one as well. Some models come with both large and small bowls and blades, and that's a good idea.  An electric mixer is important if you bake a lot. You may even want two: a powerful standing mixer and a small, handheld mixer. If you don't bake much, get a wire whisk and save both money and counter space.  A blender is an inexpensive and underrated but extremely useful tool, especially if you want to make creamy soups or blended drinks. In a pinch, it can perform many of the functions of a food processor, too. (The converse is not true.)  A coffee grinder is something to think about if you don't have one. For $10 you'll have the ability to grind spices fresh, which makes a real difference.  A microwave is the most overrated appliance of all time. For heating and warming, and the occasional vegetable, it's not bad. But unless you have a big kitchen, reheat your coffee frequently, or are too lazy to make real popcorn, it takes up more counter space than it's worth. (And as for the bread machine, you've probably already discovered the limits of that!)  Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2003. c 1993-2002 Microsoft Corporation.

      Nung nasa Pilipinas pa ang inyong Manang At dumating ang bayaw na balikbayan, Araw-araw, nagpapabili ng pandesal, Ito kasi ang nami-miss nya sa kanyang almusal.  Ngayon, si Manang, nasa parehong kalagayan, Pero walang panaderyang nagbebenta ng pandesal Nang ipamalita ang "Kusina" sa mga kaibigan, "Ayan! I-feature mo ang paggawa ng pandesal!"  (Patay! Ang pandesal, di ko pa nasubukan...)   Kaya sa alaala, pilit na hinalughog Mga panaderong sa masa ay humubog Ipinikit ang mata upang balikan Mahigit dalawang dekada nang nakaraan.  Tulad ni  urlLink Sassy , humanap ng sweet bread recipe Pang bread machine, mula  urlLink Fleischmann's Bakery  Kasi ang sangkap, pang-family size lang Para pag pumalpak, di nakakahinayang  (Mahal kasi grocery eh! At mas madali ubusin.)   Si  urlLink Manong Ken , me resipi nga, Pero sabi nya, me halong daya Di kasi kanya yun, di sya panadero Ang sangkap at proseso, iba sa alam ko.  (Parang mahirap ba...)   Nung bata kasi ako, sa panaderya ni Tatay Sa paghulma at pagsalansan, laging nakaantabay Sa kakahawak ng dough, nahasa ang mga kamay Yung nga lang, resipi't sangkap, di ako nasanay.  Paggamit ng pugon, di rin natutunan Para sa batang patpatin, medyo me kahirapan Pero paglabas dun, alam ko ang gagawin Palamigin, hiwain, balutin, KAININ!  Kaya eto ngayon, aking sinusubukan Papel ng panadero, kaya bang gampanan? Unang subok, sumobra, medyo natusta Pangalawang subok, umubra, tamang-tama ang timpla!  Wish ko lang pandesal ko ay inyong matikman Keso o mantekilya ang gawing palaman Pero ang tangi ko lang kayang gawin Ilagay sa website nang sa inyo ay maihain.  Lika, kusina ko ay iyong bisitahin Paggawa ng pandesal, iyo ring subukin  (excited ka na no?)  Sana kahit paano, natulungan kita, Kahit araw-araw, me pandesal ka na!  (Pasensya na at tinopak si Manang. Masyado na-inspire nang makakain uli ng pandesal. Bahala na kayo mag-translate sa mga mates/friends nyo. FYI nga pala, masa is the Tagalog word for dough, or the rootword for the Tagalog of knead.) &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    At the time of making the recipe page, I had tried a third recipe, the " urlLink  Old-Fashioned Buttermilk recipe  " from the Fleischmann's website which was the  best  I have tried so far (I first tried the " urlLink Buttery Sweet Bread ", second the " urlLink Basic Egg Bread " which turned out better than the first).The dough was much stickier, harder to handle that I had to sprinkle flour before shaping it into a log, very gently handling the dough as if it were a baby. The rest of the procedure was just the same, and the resulting rolls were much much delightfully crunchy  on the outside,  spongy  (take note, Dra. D! Sabihin sa asawa...) and moist on the inside, and stayed soft til afternoon (kept in airtight plastic bag upon cooling down. My Mom-in-law had a chance to sample it, and actually requested that I make it the next day, for our gathering in celebration of my Dad-in-law's birthday. I strongly recommend that recipe.  For those without bread machine, you can try the recipes under conventional method in the said website, using actuve dry yeast instead of breadmaker yeast.  For those without buttermilk, you can substitute it with 1 tbsp cider vinegar plus enough fresh milk to make 1 cup, then use the right proportion in preparing the dough as per ingredients. (I saw this tip in the Cooking Pleasures Magazine of CookingClub.com, which sparked the idea of trying that recipe in making pandesal.)  For those without fresh milk (presuming I have followers in the Philippines, but please help our small businesses by patronizing the local bakeries), use 1:1 ratio of evaporated milk and water.  Yun lang...

      I am too busy right now (we're finishing the boys' rooms) to write a longer post...so I  just picked this from my Yahoo...   If you eat too many simple carbs at breakfast -- say, a donut and coffee with sugar -- your blood sugar rises and then quickly falls, and you'll feel your energy sag. Try oatmeal, whole-grain bread or fruit instead. Aim for three daily servings of fiber-rich carbs -- eat whole fruits rather than drinking juice whenever possible; you'll get more fiber, which helps slow the digestion of fruit sugars. Another good choice is starchy vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes, eaten with the nutrient-packed skin.    I will post about menu planning using the TCR and Food Exchange list by next week, hopefully...

      As I was previously browsing the pages of asawa.org, the thread of discussion on proper food handling caught my attention. The main topic was about refrigeration and left-over food, with concerns about how long before the cooked food should be refrigerate...etc. While it is true that ideally, we should refrigerate food within two hours after eating, it is also advisable to reheat to boiling such left-overs before consumption. Filipinos have practised letting the food attain a room temperature before refrigeration (because we think it would be a burden to the compressor of the ref to put hot/warm items inside), and commonly, coupled with proper reheating before eating it again, we don't suffer from food poisoning (usually caused by Staphylococcal enterotoxin). For such items as mayonnaise-containing left-over (like egg sandwich or salad with dressing), which we will NOT re-heat prior to eating, it is advisable to refrigerate within 2 hours after it is cooked, or better yet, consume everything before it reaches 12 hours in the fridge, less if at Room Temp, or throw away any left-over. It is never comfortable to suffer from the ill effects of Staphylococcal Food Poisoning (or any other food poisoning for that matter).  See if your kitchen will pass the Food Safety Test:   By Paula Kurtzweil  What comes to mind when you think of a clean kitchen? Shiny waxed floors? Gleaming stainless steel sinks? Spotless counters and neatly-arranged cupboards?  They can help, but a truly “clean” kitchen—that is, one that ensures safe food—relies on more than just looks: It also depends on safe food practices.  In the home, food safety concerns revolve around three main functions: food storage, food handling, and cooking. To see how well you're doing in each, take this quiz, and then read on to learn how you can make the meals and snacks from your kitchen the safest possible.  Quiz  Choose the answer that best describes the practice in your household, whether or not you are the primary food handler.  1. The temperature of the refrigerator in my home is:  a. 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius)  b. 41° F (5° C)  c. I don't know; I've never measured it.  2.

Meat, poultry and fish products are defrosted in my home by:  a. setting them on the counter   b. placing them in the refrigerator  c. microwaving  Answers  1. Refrigerators should stay at 41° F (5° C) or less, so if you chose answer B, give yourself two points. If you didn't, you're not alone. According to Joseph Madden, Ph.D., strategic manager for microbiology in the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, many people overlook the importance of maintaining an appropriate refrigerator temperature.  His advice: Measure the temperature with a thermometer and, if needed, adjust the refrigerator's temperature control dial.  A temperature of 41° F (5° C) or less is important because it slows the growth of most bacteria. The temperature won't kill the bacteria, but it will keep them from multiplying, and the fewer there are, the less likely you are to get sick from them....  2. Answer B is the best practice; give yourself two points if you picked it.  Hot foods should be refrigerated as soon as possible within two hours after cooking. But don't keep the food if it's been standing out for more than two hours. Don't taste test it, either. Even a small amount of contaminated food can cause illness.  Date leftovers so they can be used within a safe time. Generally, they remain safe when refrigerated for three to five days. If in doubt, throw it out....  3. If answer A best describes your household's practice, give yourself two points. Give yourself one point if you chose B.  ... [T]he kitchen sink drain, disposal and connecting pipe are often overlooked, but they should be sanitized periodically by pouring down the sink a solution of 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of chlorine bleach in 1 quart (about 1 liter) of water or a solution of commercial kitchen cleaning agent made according to product directions. Food particles get trapped in the drain and disposal and, along with the moistness, create an ideal environment for bacterial growth.  4. If answer C best describes your household's practice, give yourself two points. Washing with soap and hot water and then sanitizing with a mild bleach solution is the safest practice ...  If you picked A, you're violating an important food safety rule: Never allow raw meat, poultry and fish to come in contact with other foods. Answer B isn't good, either. Improper washing, such as with a damp cloth, will not remove bacteria.  5. Give yourself two points if you picked answer C.  The safest way to eat hamburgers is to cook them until they are no longer red in the middle and the juices run clear ... Cooking food, including ground meat patties, to an internal temperature of at least 160°F (71° C) usually protects against food-borne illness. Well-done meats reach that temperature.  To be on the safe side, check cooked meat, fish and poultry with a meat thermometer to ensure that they have reached a safe internal temperature.  For microwaved food, follow directions, including the standing time, either in or out of the microwave, after cooking. Microwave cooking creates pockets of heat in the food, but allowing the food to stand before eating allows the heat to spread to the rest of the food.  6. If you answered A, you may be putting yourself at risk for infection with Salmonella enteritidis, a bacterium that can be in shell eggs. Cooking the egg or egg-containing food product to at least 140°F (60° C) kills the bacteria. So answer C—eating the baked product—will earn you two points.  You'll get two points for answer B, also. Foods containing raw eggs, such as homemade ice cream, cake batter, mayonnaise, and eggnog, carry a Salmonella risk, but their commercial counterparts don't. Commercial products are made with pasteurized eggs and ... are not a food hazard....  7. Answers C or D will earn you two points each; answer B, one point ... Bleach and commercial kitchen cleaning agents are the best sanitizers—provided they're diluted according to product directions. They're the most effective at getting rid of bacteria. Hot water and soap does a good job, too, but may not kill all strains of bacteria. Water may get rid of visible dirt, but not bacteria.  Also, be sure to keep dishcloths and sponges clean because, when wet, these materials harbor bacteria and may promote their growth.  8. Answers A and C are worth two points each. There are potential problems with B and D. When you let dishes sit in water for a long time ... the food left on the dish contributes nutrients for bacteria, so the bacteria will multiply. When washing dishes by hand ... it's best to wash them all within two hours. Also, it's best to air-dry them so you don't handle them while they're wet.  9. The only correct practice is answer C. Give yourself two points if you picked it.  Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food, especially raw meat, poultry and fish. If you have an infection or cut on your hands, wear rubber or plastic gloves. Wash gloved hands just as often as bare hands because the gloves can pick up bacteria. (However, when washing gloved hands, you don't need to take off your gloves and wash your bare hands, too.)  10. Give yourself two points if you picked B or C. Food safety experts recommend thawing foods in the refrigerator or the microwave oven or putting the package in a water-tight plastic bag submerged in cold water and changing the water every 30 minutes ...  When microwaving, follow package directions ... Smaller items will defrost more evenly than larger pieces of food. Foods defrosted in the microwave oven should be cooked immediately after thawing.  Do not thaw meat, poultry and fish products on the counter or in the sink without cold water; bacteria can multiply rapidly at room temperature.  Rating Your Home's Food Practices  20 points: Feel confident about the safety of foods served in your home.  12 to 19 points: Reexamine food safety practices in your home. Some key rules are being violated.  11 points or below: Take steps immediately to correct food handling, storage and cooking techniques used in your home. Current practices are putting you and other members of your household in danger of food-borne illness.  Source: FDA Consumer, October 1995.

      I have a new lay-out, mas bagay kasi ang colors sa geocities webpage ng kitchen ko. I have edited my recent recipe entries as well, so that the visitor can have instant view of the food, and the title is directly linked to the recipe page! (o di ba mas madali? I'm learning...hehe...). Wish ko lang matutunan ko kung pano mag-categorize ng recipes, pero pang-upgraded (meaning, paid) accounts lang ata yun...wala naman akong balak pagkagastusan ang hobby na to...especially hindi naman ako nagtatrabaho...

      My brother-in-law was getting married, and his fiancee requested that I prepare the rolls. Although I was quite unsure how I would manage to prepare freshly baked rolls for ~150 people, I did not want to turn her down. So I looked for the recipe that included instructions for freezing before baking (my first attempt at baking rolls had an output of 4 dozens! It was hard to consume all. Nakakasawa!). And I found this recipe from Sarah's kitchen (see links on the side). Still, my problem was planning the timing of baking, as well as preparing the materials that I would need (about 8 baking pans at least!) Glad my mom-in-law saved me from that predicament, though. She told my bilas that we could buy finger rolls and then just use with egg- or ham- or tuna-mayo filling. I really love my mom-in-law. Still, I prepare this once every 2 months (dividing it into 3 batches for serving 3 times in a week's span.). My husband sees it as a treat!   urlLink

      I was looking at my collection of printed recipes and this idea was from Del Monte Kitchenomics, but the original recipe did not include using celery sticks, and also called for deep frying and using its famous tomato sauce. I try to avoid deep-frying as much as possible for health reasons, and also because it is messier and cooks only several pieces at a time. So I baked instead, together with the dinner rolls. And as usual, in this recipe I made use of the home-made stewed tomatoes from my Mom-in-law. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Rice is the staple food of the Filipinos. I love rice and I grew up eating rice at every meal, sometimes even during  merienda .  Then a daily help tip from My Yahoo posted this:    Choose complex carbohydrate over simple sugars! Simple sugars in white flour, pasta, rice and cake are digested and absorbed quickly and can cause blood sugar swings and cravings. Complex carbohydrate are foods that contain fiber, including whole grains, whole grain breads and cereals, whole fruit instead of juice and vegetables and salads.    HELLO! Excuse me! In biochemistry, simple sugars mean carbohydrates consisting of one (monosaccharide) or two (disaccharide) units. AS far as I remember, no food has monosaccharides. And as far as I know, the simplest sugars in our diet are the dissacharides sucrose (in table sugar), fructose (in fruits), lactose (in milk), and maltose (in beer) (tell me if you know of other sugars in our diet). Sugars with more than two units are polysaccharides, which may be simple (unbranched) or complex (branched). Starch, cellulose, glycogen (in muscles and liver of humans and animals), chitin (in exoskeletons of crustaceans like shrimps and crabs) are some examples.  urlLink Starch is a complex polysaccharide .   urlLink This  PDF shows a schematic diagram of grains in general (which can represent rice and wheat and other grains). It shows that most of the grain has starch as its major component in the endosperm. Therefore, rice, be it white or brown, is a complex carbohydrate. However, the brown rice is more nutrient packed and has more fiber (which is also a nutrient, by the way, in contrast to what some claim that white rice is devoid of nutrients). A comparison of brown versus white rice is found  urlLink here . And this  urlLink site  shows a comparison of the nutrients in different carbohydrate-rich foods. So for the health-conscious, preferring brown over white rice is okay. For the white-rice lovers like me, don't be guilty. In the first place, these "healthier" options are sold at a higher price (siyempre, mapagsamantala sa business, parang yung mga nagsasamantala sa low-carb fad). Secondly, we Filipinos tend to eat more veggies than the typical American (meaning, not health-conscious) and less meat. We even eat the tender stems of many vegetables and those are rich in fiber! (The typical American don't. I know of one who even asked his friends if they eat the stem of broccoli...). The key is still a wide variety in the contents of your menu (should include all those included in the food pyramid).  So for those rice lovers like me, just know your limit in terms of carbo percentage in your TCR. Wag magpa-uto sa mga low-carb food items on the grocery shelves. Those are just for the ignorant. (Bakit ko babaguhin ang eating habits ko eh ang sexy ko kaya para sa may 2 anak...ano hilo?)

      Before going to the Food Exchange List, something on the Nutrition Facts found in most food merchandise uniformly had this note and table:  "Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 cal diet. Your daily caloric values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs:     Caloric need 2,000  2,500    Total Fat  Less than 65 g   25 g      Sat Fat  Less than  20 g   25 g      Cholesterol  Less than  300 mg   300 mg     Sodium  Less than  2,400 mg  2,400 mg      Potassium    3,500 mg   3,500      Total Carbohydrate    300 g   375 g     Dietary Fiber    25 g   30 g      I was suprised that none said anything about the PDV for Proteins. Intrigued, I went on to search for Food Pyramid info. I found a good  urlLink website  that shows all key factors that any person should understand about the food pyramid and the corresponding servings.   This is a good site for a  urlLink food exchange list .  However, while they emphasize the same carbo-prot-fat proportions in the pyramid and all the warnings about hidden fat, I do not quite agree on what they say about the proportion of fat in the diet. They both say that fat intake should be limited to 30% (one said 20-30%). No mention of the actual percentage for carbohydrate nor for protein. Just servings and pounds and grams (not even having the same unit).   Then this  urlLink webpage   hails Chinese Cooking saying that "Steamed Chinese dishes reflect the Asian Food Pyramid, meaning meat is used sparingly, like a condiment." Then it features two recipes: Steamed Chicken with Red and Yellow Bell Pepper & Steamed Fish and Vegetables. These recipes DID NOT use meat sparingly!   I do not abhor Chinese Cooking. In fact, many Filipino dishes are influenced by the Chinese and other Asians, and yes, they are mostly healthy. But dishes which most Filipinos take for granted because they are so simple to prepare (and so are less challenging, like nilaga, paksiw, inihaw, sinigang, coupled with dip which usually consists of diced raw tomatoes, calamansi juice,  with a drizzle of patis, sometimes vinegar with garlic, onion, pepper and salt), are actually as healthy, if not healthier. But that will be another discussion.  While the websites I cited above say fat should be around 20-30% of the total daily caloric intake, I firmly stick to my proportion: 60-65% Carbohydrate, 30-35% protein, and the rest is fat. Anyway, it is so easy to satisfy that fat requirement just eating a chunk of meat. I don't have to worry about where to get the fat. The problem will be more of how I should limit my fat intake.   Why do I FIRMLY hold on to that caloric distribution? Common sense tells me.  For one thing, the Food Pyramid is a graphical representation of that caloric distribution. (Vitamins and Minerals are not calories, but fruits and vegetables give us that, plus some carbo and proteins, minimal fats).  Another thing is the Biochemical Pathways we are all (some are vaguely) familiar of: The   Kreb's Cycle  and the  Oxidative Phosphorylation  . Do you remember that from high school biology and chemistry?   Calorie is a measure of energy. We as living organisms all run on energy. While most vehicles run on gasoline as its source of energy, our main fuel is the glucose, a simple carbohydrate. Kreb's-Oxidative Phosphorylaton is the most cost-effective method of producing energy in that we invest a little and make lots of profits.  Glucose is mainly the product of carbohydrate breakdown (either dietary or from glycogen stores in the muscles and liver). Sometimes our body have to produce glucose from protein or fat sources to produce glucose -- a process known as gluconeogenesis. Diet-wise (aka extrinsic source), we get carbohydrates from the GO foods: rice, bread, potatoes, corn, pasta, noodles, sweet potatoes, gelatin, starch, and so on (these are complex carbohydrates_, and the simple sugars (table sugar, fruit sugar, milk sugar). We eat them, and digestion and absorption starts as early as the oral phase (we have enzymes in our saliva that can braeak down the simple sugars. The glucose then can be absorbed through the mucous membrane, to be carried by minute capillaries. There are big veins under the tounge that can also rapidly assimilate it.  Here lies the importance of knowing the benefits of eating complex carbohydrates vs simple carbohydrates, especially for the diabetics who can't tolerate a big influx of glucose into his bloodstream at one time, therefore the need to avoid fluctations. The way to do it is by preferring complex carbohydrates.   At one point in time we always do something that requires energy, and we get this energy mainly from Kreb's cycle and the Oxidative Phosphorylation. The raw material for this cycle is glucose, the main product of digesting the carbohydrates, )and of glycogen breakdown and of gluconeogenesis). If we eat too many simple carbohydrates at one time, we come up with too much substrate for energy production. However, if we are not performing an activity that does not require that much energy, we don't use all those glucose substrates for energy production. We then start to convert these to storage forms --  glycogen and fats , or use them in synthesizing another substance to be used in another process (i.e. ribose-5-phosphate as substrate for DNA and RNA).   By preferring to use complex carbohydrate, we distribute the glucose influx through time. Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars (thereby making them complex) . Therefore it takes longer to break them down, and absorb them. So they get to the bloodstream available for energy production at a slower and continuous phase.   Glucose in the bloodstream, at a certain point, send signals to the brain that we have energy source. If we eat too fast, we can eat so much at a time before the brain finally gets that signal. Eating slowly, savoring every bite, gives our body the chance to digest the food and get to that point of satiety more precisely. Compare this with driving to look for a house. Drive fast, and you might miss that point the first time you pass by it. Drive slowly, and you will have less chance to miss the place. Thus having arrived at that satiety point, the brain sends the same signal to the digestive tract. We might still want to have more, but it becomes uncomfortable to overcrowd the gut at that point (this happens when one has conditioned himself through time of having only a little amount of food in the stomach at a time).  The energy (ATP) that we derive from glucose, we use mainly for cellular functions (we need energy to think, we need energy input to run the Kreb's cycle), at other times for structural purposes (everyday we lose some hair strands, some skin cells. If we work out, our body needs substrates to repair tissue damage to the sore muscles.).  So it's: carbohydrate is all about energy.  Why do I allot 30% of caloric intake coming from proteins? Because everyday we have structural degradation: sloughing of skin and mucosal cells, shedding of hair, fighting off microorganisms (antibodies are mainly proteins), muscle repair, etc. So protein is for structure.  While the food pyramid talks about energy sources, and putting emphasis on the carbohydrate and fats as main sources of energy, they do not emphasize the protein's significant role in structure (understandably, because structure is different from energy), but it can be a source of energy in the same level as carbohydrates (4 calories per gram), although not as cost-effective as far as net energy profit is concerned..  What about fats?  Fat is indispensable in providing the essential fatty acids (essential meaning we cannot synthesize these fatty acids; they have to come from the diet) – linoleic acid and a-linolenic acid. These are essential nutrients that the body cannot make for itself, vital for the structure and function of all cells, and also as chemical messengers.   Fat is also essential for the provision and absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.  Fat is the most efficient  stored form of energy , meaning, it acts as a reserve, when we don't have enough carbohydrate to use for energy source.  Lipid is another term for fats/oils. Going to the cellular level, we might recall that the cell membrane is made up of a phospho-lipid bilayer,  urlLink which is composed of various cholesterol, phospholipids, glycolipids and proteins.  And the cell is the main unit of structure of any eukaryote (plants, animals, including humans).  So the Food Pyramid reflects energy requirement and distribution, but not necessarily the Recommended Daily Allowance for the nutrients, which he have to have to avoid illnesses resulting from deficiencies.  Kakahilo no?  It will be so confusing and overwhelming to look at the importance of every nutrient we get. I just say that, in my opinion, to make things simpler, I have to know my TCR, and get the calories from carbo, prot, and fat sources as I already deemed fit (65-30-5), add vitamins and minerals (I still prefer natural sources), water and fiber (these topics will be discussed later).  I will try to illustrate how to use the Food Exchange List in coming up with an example menu on my next Health and Nutrition Post.  A last note: eat moderately and responsibly. You will still be able to enjoy food... :)

      I have been staining several pieces of pine board for our ceiling (my husband and I have been slowly building our house). I found out the stain is very hard to remove by washing with soap. So I thought, maybe, just like grease (my husband always handles grease), it is oil-based, or at least, of non-polar substance.  Used oil can be carcinogenic (so I read a long time ago; maybe if stale), so I avoid re-using it for cooking. But I hate throwing it away just like that, esp. oil used for deep-frying -- there's just so much of it.  I came up with an idea to use it another way before throwing it away, and tried it, and it worked! Here's what I do:  Before staining, I use the oil to lightly grease my hands (to lessen the paint that will penetrate my skin). Then I prepare on the sink two bowls: 1 with lots of used oil, and another with soap solution (made of dishwashing liquid plus water). I get on with the staining.   After that back-breaking (non-paying) job ( :( ), I dip my hands into the bowl of oil, let the stain dissolve it (it's like washing off eye-make up or oil-based lipstick with a cotton ball dabbed with baby oil). With the stain dissolved in oil, I wipe off some using old newspaper, then I now make use of the soap solution to wash off the oil-stain from my hands. (It is better to use soap solution in emulsifying the oil, rather than pure soap to wash it off. It's like the action of bile salts on fats and oils we ingest to emulsify it and transform it into a more soluble form for easier digestion.) Aside from making the stain easier to wash off, the oil gives added protection to my skin, making it less dry after washing.  Okay...gotta run now to start staining (now I have oil blotches on my keyboard! :( )

      As much as possible, I try to avoid buying mixes available in the supermarkets (e.g. yellow cake mix, brownie mix, pancake mix) because I want to know exactly (to the best of my ability) the contents of what my family is going to eat, and I want to minimize unwanted additives. So I searched for pancake mixes and found  urlLink this    (there are variations for your perusal but I featured here how I like it prepared).  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Because now I have access to all-natural home-made unadulterated maple syrup, the more frequent I make pancakes as well as french toast.

      This is a very simple dish to prepare. As I have warned the visitors to my online kitchen (this site), I am no expert in cooking and computers. So this is mainly for the newbies.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Anyway, my kids love this, and so does my husband (although my fussy husband likes lasagna most when it comes to pasta). I like to make it when I have leftover Kraft's mac & cheese and sauteed ground beef (my husband likes that simple combination, which, to me, seem so incomplete, maybe for lack of challenge in preparation).

      So How do we apply the TCR? (I wonder if any reader, if I have readers at all, took the time to calculate her TCR. Those formulas can be daunting at first glance.)  Let's use the loaf of bread as an example. Look for the Nutrition Facts. Take note of the Serving Size. 1 slice is equivalent to one serving.   Then look at the breakdown of the amount of nutrients you get from that 1 slice.    Total Fat              .5 g Cholesterol           0   g Sodium              133   mg Total Carbohydrate   12   g Protein               2   g   Then it goes to say the percentage of Vitamins and Minerals present in that 1 slice.  Then a footnote that "Percent Daily Value (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet."  What does this exactly mean?   It means that:   .5 g of Total Fat will satisfy 1% of your daily caloric need,  12 g of Carbohydrate will satisfy 4% of your daily caloric need  and 2 g of Protein will satisfy (unstated) of your daily caloric need  (Note: the sample I was holding said 4% for carbo and had nothing for protein - must be typographical error)  That computation already is erroneous and shows that calories from fat is just 4, making it satisfy 0.2% of the DV.  The same bread I am holding now as I try to make my point here has a Food Pyramid Guide beside that tabulation of Nutrition Facts. We are all familiar with this Food Pyramid: The base has the carbohydrates as main source of caloric intake and recommends 6-11 servings. Next level up is composed of vegetables (3-5) and fruits (2-3), followed by protein sources like meat (2-3) and dairy (2-3), and at the top (least amount of intake) is the fat.  But a person would often ask: How many servings should I have of each?  What the consumers need to know for the pyramid to work is how many calories is in the whole thing. It varies with each individual, and the food groups represent a certain percentage of that whole pyramid.The TCR determines the number of calories needed for a day, and the individual should learn now how to distribute the number of calories to each food group.  Here now lies the error in the above example where the fat (0.5 g) in a slice of bread is supposedly giving you 1% of your daily caloric intake. What they fail to do (or maybe deliberately do) is to take into consideration that RECOMMENDED AMOUNT of fat in a day. In the Food Pyramid, the recommended daily intake of fat should be around 5% of the total caloric intake.   So what is wrong in the 0.5 g of fat in a slice of bread satisfying 1% (supposedly) of the 2000 cal DV?  Here's what is wrong. The recommended 5% of a 2000 cal diet will mean 100 cal from fat sources.   From prior Biochemistry lessons, 1 gm of fat gives 9 cal; 1 gm protein  or carbohydrate gives 4 cal.  Using the FOOD PYRAMID as a guide, I should eat more carbohydrate than protein, least of fat. Again, from Biochemistry lessons that I had during my medical studies, 60-65% of my caloric intake should come from carbohydrates, 30-35% should come from protein, and 5% from fats. I now settle to: 65% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 5% fats.   So distributing this caloric requirement using my own TCR and not that in the Nutrition Facts (which is 2000 cal), I should have daily the following amounts of food:       (1800 x 0.65) carbohydate + (1800 x 0.30 proteins) + (1800 x 0.05 fats)  translated to:       1170 cal from carbohydrate + 540 cal from proteins + 90 calories from fats = 1800 total calories  To get the weight equivalents of these values using simple ratio and proportion,      (1170 cal  x 1 gm carbo/4 cal ), (540 cal x 1 gm protein/4 cal), and (90 cal x 1 gm fat/9 cal) will give us (rounded-off values):      293 gm carbohydrate, 135 gm protein, and 10 gm fats.  DAILY.  If I eat only bread in the above example as sole source of food, then, as far as carbohydrates are concerned, I can eat (293gm/12gm per slice =) 24 slices per day, but if I pay attention to protein requirement, I should eat (135 gm/2 gm per slice =) 65 slices per day!, and as far as fat requirement is concerned, I should eat (10 gm/ 0.5 gm per slice =)  20 slices per day! But realistically, I can only eat 2-4 slices per day, and that is not without anything on the bread. I gotta have a spread on it. And I gotta have my steak or chicken or fish, and I gotta have my veggies and fruits and water, I GOTTA ENJOY FOOD in the same way I enjoy cooking.  So where do I go from here? Should I weigh every food item? Should I count my every caloric intake? No.  Acquaint yourself with a Food Exchange List. Then approximate, be conscious of the approximate caloric intake you have for every type of food you eat. Learn when you have had ENOUGH for your needs and then control yourself. You don't have to deprive yourself of fatty or sweet foods unless you have metabolic problems (e.g. diabetes) or other health conditions (e.g. hypertension) to consider. The key is knowing when enough is enough.  What about  urlLink vitamins  and minerals?   Leafy veggies don't have much of carbohydrate, but are packed with vitamins and minerals (which are nutrients they derived from the soil). Some we get from protein sources (which animals got from the plants/animals they eat). Save from the fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K), other vitamins are water-soluble. The implication: If you have excess intake of fat-sol vitamins, they tend to be stored in our fat cells, so there's more danger of toxicity for these vitamins IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH OF THEM. Excess water-soluble vitamins, on the other hand, are easily excreted in the urine, so there is less danger of toxicity, and more possibility of deficiency. Just drink lots of water (it has other advantages other than excreting excess vitamins, but that is another story...) There are veggies with carbohydrate (usu. non-leafy) and/or minimal amount of protein.  Next Health and Nutrition Topic: The Food Exchange List (or better yet, find a book on it) and its application to the previous topics.

      Mag-isa ako sa bahay ngayon, nagla-lunch: tira-tirang baked beans at mac & cheese.  Naaalala ko tuloy yung Hunt's pork n beans natin sa Pinas. Mas masarap yun eh, kulay pula pa. Dito brown yung baked beans nila at me ibang lasang di ko maintindihan. Pero dahil gusto ng asawa ko, type na rin. Flexible naman ako eh.  Noon, sa Pinas, di ko pinapapak ang pork n beans. Hinahalo ko sa nilagang baboy. Nasubukan mo bayun? Maglaga ka ng white beans na kamuka ng nasa pork n beans hanggang malambot. Gusto mo, sabay mo sila palambutin ng baboy, (liempo sana masarap pero dito kasi, lean pork lagi available sa grocery stores) with a halved tomato, halved onion, and 2 whole cloves of garlic, 5 peppercorns, a bay leaf. Tapos ihalo mo yung pork n beans. Then last yung cabbage. Sarap nun!   Dito me iba akong ginamit (hindi yung baked beans, di ko talaga type lasa nun eh) sa ganung style ng luto. Butterbeans (bigay ng byenan ko, frozen), and spinach, tsaka tomato sauce or stewed tomatoes. Sarap na sarap ako. Ang mga anak, medyo naga-adjust yung panganay ko (conditioned kasi sya na ayaw nya ng butterbeans -- yung plain naman yung ayaw nya eh). Yung bunso naman gustung-gusto (baliktad sila ngayon). Pag bumili ako uli ng pork, gagawin ko yun at idadagdag ko sa koleksyon ko.  Dami ko nang photos ng mga niluto ko for the past week. Pero hindi ko pa ginagawan ng recipe page. Konting control. Kaka-addict pala maggawa ng webpage at magblog. Baka makalimutan ko na maglinis ng bahay at maglaba kung tututukan ko. I'm getting ready pa nga for my veggie garden (nagtanim kami ng onions at spinach sa garden. me seedlings naman ako ng tomatillo ang jalapeño pepper sa tray, aside from pansies, foxglove, at shasta daisy for my flower garden. Sa perennial flower garden ko namumukadkad na ang tulips ko. Dami ko nang photos, from daybreak hangang high noon hanggang tumiklop uli ang petals sa gabi, makakagawa ata ko ng webpage sa tulips lang. Haha!)  Hay, wish ko lang pinagkakakitaan ko ito bukod sa nag-e-enjoy ako...  Kakapanibago...ang haba ngayon ng araw. 7:30 na ng gabi, parang alas-singko pa lang sa Pinas...  Bukas ang bagong cooking recipe feature...  Sa ngayon, magpapaganda muna ako kasi kasal ng bibilasin ko mamayang alas-singko. Kelan ba ako huling nagbihis ng pormal? Nakalimutan ko na. Buti na lang kasya pa ang mga damit ko sa kin. At buti na lang bumalik na sa 28 ang bewang ko! (Last winter, umabot sa 31! Kain kasi nang kain eh...)

      I don't advise (and I try to practise this as much as I could) buying candies for the kids (but sometimes my husband would succumb to the pressures when the kids ask him). For those whose children are fond of candies made in Mexico, please read this  urlLink FDA warning .  It has been a longstanding objective of the FDA to reduce, to theextent practicable, consumer exposure to lead from foods. The adverse health effects of elevated lead levels in children are well documented and can  result in delayed mental and physical development and learning deficiencies.

      There are a lot of dishes calling for beef broth. Even  urlLink Sassy  has a lot of recipes calling for boiling beef until tender then setting aside the beef broth for other dishes, and says that the beef broth can be frozen.  Here's how I do so:  I let the broth cool down so sediments can settle down. Then I line the empty plastic cups of sour cream with sandwich bags (open-top type) and pour the broth into it, then cover, and place them inside the freezer. After a while I remove them from the freezer, take out the plastic with the frozen broth, tie to seal, then place the cubes back to the freezer. They are now ready for any dishes calling for beef broth in 1-cup quantities. You can also use them to boil potatoes (for mashed potato recipes) or other veggies.  P.S.  Happy Mother's Day  to all Struggling Mothers like me, as well as to those who have been there and continue to inspire us...

      When my husband gave me a Kitchen Aid for Christmas gift last year, my first task was to learn making  urlLink whoopie pies  the way his mom made it. The first picture in my head was the way we know pies -- with pie crust and filling of any sort. What on earth was whoopie pie?   I have never before made any pie, because I did not have ovens (home-scale use) to bake with when I was in the Philippines, and that is true, I realize now, to this date. I have never baked a pie.  When I learned how to make whoopie pies after a session under the tutorial of my  butihing  mom-in-law with my sister-in-law  (o di ba, sabay kami natuto ni sis?) , I realized whoopie pie is NOT A PIE -- its a soft cookie of some sort, with a cream filling. Don't ask me why they named it such.   This is how whoopie pies look like:    There are lots of variations of the recipe which I gathered from allrecipes.com and cooks.com, none exactly like my mom's, but there was one close, in the sense that it also used fresh egg whites for the filling.  CAUTION: Make this if you have FRESH EGGS. (I'm lucky I have continuous supply of fresh eggs from myin-laws who raise their chickens). If you are not sure of the freshness of the eggs, I suggest you go to allrecipes.com and find whoopie pie recipes that use other ingredients (e.g. marshmallow fluff). Otherwise you might end up with Salmonella infection (which can cause food poisoning.)  I have invited a Filipina internist, who is also a recent migrant, to share opinions, tips, advice, etc., on this blog. And she agreed!!!! Yippeeee! (I will have to wait for her username, though).  I also have received a message from Marilou. Thanks, and I hope you will also share some of your recipes, tips, and other experiences in this blog. This will become a teamblog, where I can invite people to post their own tips here. I only need to receive your messages and e-mail addresses.  I just hope that when the team grows, we will stick to the topic: how Filipinas in other countries bend their cooking and kitchen skills to adapt to their new environment. Walang personalan, walang tirahan.  In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the whoopie pies. I prepare the filling first before I bake the dough. Because I like my whoopie pies freshly-baked. BUT, you have to put the filling when cookies are cooled already. Warning: It can cause addiction.  (Sarap kasi eh!)

      I couldn't help posting about this.  Last week, one of my sons went home from school and brought this 8-page magazine of  urlLink Time For Kids (TFK).  It was a special Earth Day issue. I saw this article that I thought would be interesting to post here. (The site required an access code so I just copied and pasted the whole article here. The magazine itself had photos of children collecting maple sap and harvesting veggies, but the online article does not.)    FOOD FOR THOUGHT     School gardens, a growing trend, teach kids to take better care of themselves and the planet    It's science class for some eighth graders at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Berkeley, California. But the students aren't sitting at their desks. Instead, they are harvesting fava beans and planting corn in their school's one-acre garden. Everything in the garden--from broccoli and carrots to strawberries and oranges--is grown organically, without the use of harmful chemicals.  King students have been digging into learning this way since 1997. That's when Alice Waters, a famous chef, started a program called the Edible Schoolyard at their school. Teachers and kids incorporate the organic garden into many lessons. In math class, they measure vegetable beds; in art, they draw the wonders of nature, and garden ingredients create cultural feasts for social studies lessons. While they learn, the kids develop a taste for healthful eating.  THE SEEDS OF LEARNING  North Country School in Lake Placid, New York, is another school with deep roots in garden-based learning. For almost 75 years, lessons at the boarding school have been connected to raising livestock and tending gardens. Kids participate in "complete cycles of food production, from planting and harvesting to preparing and eating," says John Culpepper, the school's farm manager. Much of the food served at North Country is homegrown, even the maple syrup. "Knowing you helped produce it makes it [taste] so much better," says Anthony Edwards, 12.  According to the National Gardening Association, about 25,000 schools in the United States involve students in gardening, and the numbers are growing like weeds! " School gardens are useful tools in improving children's nutrition and environmental awareness and [providing] a sense of peace in our fast-paced world ," says Eve Pranis, the association's director of educational media.   Waters hopes that more schools will follow the example set by King Middle School. She wants all 17 schools in its district to have similar garden programs. Waters's goal is to turn lunch into an academic subject. Students would get a grade for helping to prepare locally grown organic foods. What grade would you get for healthful eating and caring for the earth?   --By Elizabeth Winchester April 23, 2004 Vol. 9 No. 24   (highlight mine)  When I was in elementary school (I studied in a public one), we also had garden beds for such veggies as okra, pechay, tomatoes, and eggplants, but there was no such integrated approach (incorporating math, art and social studies into the veggie garden and including lunch as a subject), let alone a good lesson in cycles of food production! And even in the past, I had often wondered how ketchup was made, and as in the above article, such things as maple syrup.  In my present life, the art of canning tomato-based products, of making home-made jams (strawberry/blueberry/raspberry), and of pickling is about to unfold right before my very eyes with the coming and ending of this summer season, and I am so excited. Last March, I was lucky to have witnessed how maple syrup -- home-made, unadulterated -- is prepared. We finished the process last April. Last night I was editing the photos, and did some research into documented process (I found a government guideline for it). I will probably have it ready by next week, to be posted in my Canning Page (although I doubt that it should be called a recipe). Watch out for it.  A last note before I go offline to rake my lawn...  I have a dream for the Philippines:  I wish (and hope) that it would turn back into a self-sufficient country at least food-wise; i.e., enhance the agricultural aspect, re-teach its people how to replenish lost greens (the forest trees, and in the process invite back animals that have lost their habitats in the past), and in schools emphasize at a young age to its students the life cycle and the interrelation of one species to another, the symbiotic relationship of humans with animals and plants. I wish and hope the people will re-discover their connection with the earth and with one another in a sense of a true community, where everyone has enough, and everyone is secure.   and a dream for the world:  I wish all the people will stop being myopic and try to see the world in all its beauty, to see the universe in all its grandeur, and realize that every creature, from Paramecium to humans to whales, are all part of the world and the universe. I am not a strict environmentalist, but I do hope that people will learn to respect the chain of life. Disruption (wars, deforestation, ozone depletion) in any part of the chain will create disturbance in the whole ecosystem. It is never a local effect.

      This is a revised version of  urlLink Sassy's Vegetable stuffed beef rolls . I had plenty of frozen beef cuts, and was loooking for new ways to cook it. I had to revise because at the time, I had no tomato paste in my pantry, but I had several bottled stewed tomatoes from my mom. I also used my slow cooker because beef always tastes best (for me and my husband) using that (it was a wedding gift from my sister-in-law).    Though I accidentally put more red pepper (dried cayenne pepper from my mom, which I crushed in the blender) than I intended to, my husband loved it anyway! My younger son ate little because it was hot for him, but the older one loved it too! Needless to say, I liked it, that's why I included it in my recipe collection.

      My mother and my sister both have varicose veins. I have the spider veins (smaller, reddish version).  Though my previous occupations involved standing/sitting for long periods of time, and now, being a stay-at-home mom, I still do the same when working in my kitchen, or in front of my computer, I still have prevented acquiring those big, unsightly varicose veins despite a strong history.  How to prevent developing them? As what I used to practice with my patients (I was a general practitioner) when I was in the Philippines, I inform them first, explain the pathophysiology of an illness/condition, before proceeding with the approach of management. That was preventive medicine, which is, to me, the level of health care most often ignored by patients, but from which they would benefit most.  So what are varicose veins? These are superficial (as in underneath the skin) veins dilated (enlarged) because of poor circulation of blood, as what happens during prolonged standing and sitting. In some cases, when the blood pools it encourages clotting.   What exactly do we mean by poor circulation? Understand first that we have arteries that pump oxygenated blood away from the heart, and veins that pump unoxeygenated blood back to the heart, mediated by the capillaries.   Veins are less elastic than arteries, and have less pressure. While the arteries can squirt blood as a result of its elastic recoil brought forth by the cardiac output (the volumeof blood that comes out of the heart with every pump), the veins, on the other hand, have less resistance (they don't need it anyway, because at the capillary level, before blood from the tissues is passed on to the veins, there is minimal resistance...only a gentle stream of blood). What they have are valves, that work in such as way as follows:  Every volume of blood added to the veins with every pump of the heart, the veins receive and gradually pump(through the areterial push) back to the heart. For the leg veins, this is hard because of the gravity tending to pull the blood down. Veins have valves that prevent this volume to go back down and pool. However, for the superficial veins in the legs, the burden is severe, thus the tendency for the blood to pool. If pooled blood is enough to stretch the walls of the veins, the valves do not close properly, resulting to more backflow, more stretching, possible blood clotting -- the veins now become so unsightly, like worms.  So to prevent this formation, we must help pump the blood up. How? Move your calf muscles (or simply, your legs) during prolonged standing/sitting. How this helps?  Since the superficial veins are connected to the deep veins (embedded in the muscles), moving these muscles will squeeze the venous blood, pumping it up back to the heart. The vaccum created in these deep veins suck the blood in the superficial veins, thereby helping in continuous flow of blood from the arterial end to the heart.  Those of you who have experienced waiting long for a jeepney for vacant seats, ever noticed how your calf muscles ached, and actually got more relief if you just tried walking while waiting instead of just standing? The relief was because of this unloading of leg veins, in exchange for tired muscles, which to me is healthier than developing varicose veins, in that you develop tone in your leg muscles, and burning more calories. (Although the pollution in Metro Manila is not healthy at all.)

      It took awhile for me to look for new ways to calculate this (my Tanhausser's Formula might be outdated already. I could not search for it on the net.). Now I have found one page satisfactorily (I think) showing how to calculate it. I had to understand it first before I post anything here (one of the reasons why it took me sometime to post again). This one is much more complicated than Tanhausser (probably because it is more accurate, but for me, we can only make approximations!  But I can adopt the calculation for the Resting Metabolic Rate (aka Basic Metabolic Rate). (What is this? - This is the energy we need in the Resting State like sleeping, doing nothing, the activities mainly occurring at the cellular level.)  The page says this is from World Health Organizations. I will adopt this because in Tanhausser's, there's only one equation for adults. (One big difference, and probably why it has become obsolete, is that the Tanhausser bases the computation on an adult's height, never on the weight. Basing on the height, TF calculates for the ideal body weight then derives the rest of the caloric requirement on this IBW.)  Many will shy away from formulas, but for adults like me (I presume most of those who will be conscious about their weight will be in almost the same age range as I), all I need is to get on with this one calculation. Once I got the approximate Total Caloric Requirement specifically derived for me, I will have a very good estimation of how much I should eat in a day. YOU ONLY NEED TO CALCULATE THIS ONCE and use the result everytime you need to be reminded of how fat you have become.  Notice the packaging of a food item bought from a grocery store. There are such phrases as: (example: white bread) 1 serving = 1 slice. Then it tabulates the percentage of carbohydrate and protein and fats and vitamins that one gets from eating 1 serving of the food. This percentage refers to the Recommended Allowance. Below is written, "The above  are based on a 2000 caloric requirement." So if the tabulation shows that you get 5% carbohydarate from 1 serving (1 slice) of bread, it means that if you need 2000 calorie per day, you are satisfying 10% of that need by eating 2 slices of this white bread in one day (hence if one takes only carbohydrate into consideration, I can eat 20 slices of bread in one day to satisfy my daily need of carbohydrate, THAT IS, if I need 2000 calories in a day). Therefore, to make my diet custom-made for me, I will derive my very own Daily Caloric Requirement, which varies not only with age, height and weight but also with physical activity level.  Calculating BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate aka RMR or Resting Metabolic Rate) - This is the initial and single most important step in calculating the TCR. The formula from WHO is as follows:  World Health Organization Equations 1.  Convert body weight to kilograms:     ______ lb / 2.2 kg/lb = ______ kg  2.  Find the appropriate formula in the table below and calculate your RMR.  For example, a 19 yr. old male weighing 80 kg would have an RMR of approximately:  (15.3 x 80) + 679 = 1903 cal  Males age range (yrs) Equation to Derive RMR in cal/day   10-18 (17.5 x wt) + 651   18-30 (15.3 x wt) + 679   30-60 (11.6 x wt) + 879   Over 60 (13.5 x wt) + 487  Females     10-18 (12.2 x wt) + 746   18-30 (14.7 x wt) + 496   30-60 (8.7 x wt) + 829   Over 60 (10.5 x wt) + 596    RMR = ( ______ x ______ kg) + ______ = _____ cal/day  To show my readers (if any) that I am practicing what I preach, I will do my calculations based on the above formula for my own caloric requirement:  I already know that my approximate weight in kilograms is less than 53 kg. My age is 34.  RMR = (8.7 x 34) + 829 = 1124.8 cal/day rounded off to  1125 cal/day   Upon getting the RMR value (or the BMR), we now proceed with the TCR (Total Caloric Requirement). According to this  urlLink website  that deals with cancer in-patient nutrition, TDCR (Total Daily Caloric Requirement) calculation is as follows:  TDCR = BMR + EEA + SDA + EES  AS far as my memory serves me, my previous lessons in Biochemistry taught me that:  TCR = BMR + PA + SDA  Note: TDCR or TCR = Total Daily Caloric Requirement; BMR = Basal (or Resting) Metabolic Rate; PA = Physical Activity (which can be equal to the combination of EEA = Energy Expenditure of Activity + EES = Energy Expenditure of Stress). SDA= Specific Dynamic Action of food (the energy we spend in metbolizing the food we eat from digestion to cellular utilization).  To get PA (or EES and EEA), this depends on the level of activity of a person. I can categorize mine as moderate, taking into account my minimal walking and lifting daily exercises. Applying the website cited above (which was a guideline for calculating TCR for confined patients) in my own life , my PA will be approximately 50% of my BMR (25% is a good approximation for those with sedentary lifestyle, and 75 % or higher for those with active lifestyle like the fitness buffs, laborer, etc.) (so BMR x o.50).  As said in the guideline, SDA is approximately 10% of the BMR (so BMR x 0.10). (See why BMR is important to know?). For those with fever or infection, SDA is 5% (meaning for those people who are sick, they have less efficiency in food metabolism. More energy is spent in fighting off the infection. Hence many people who are sick are physiologically, normally anorexic = lacks appetite.)  To proceed with mine,  TCR = 1125 + (1125 x 0.50) + (1125 x 0.10)         = 1800 cal per day  I will tackle how to apply this TCR figure in my next  Health & Nutrition Tip  post.

      Don't throw those old newspapers away! You can use them for:  -wiping off excess oil/butter from the pan before washing (oil may harden if thrown into the sink and may clog later). These can be added to the firewood during winter time.  -increasing the layer of paper to absorb excess oil when deep-frying (using a single layer of paper towel on top)  -liner on the countertop to easily catch veggie scraps, etc.   -compost pits (shred them first for faster degradation)  -pattern-making for small projects (e.g. sewing cover for breadbox)  -mailing fragile items (use shredded)

      When I was still in the Philippines, everytime we had a family gathering, I would always be the one tasked to prepare leche flan and lumpia. Leche flan has always been my favorite dessert, so much so that I really searched for the recipe of the one that most appealed to me...not the one with eggyolks (I found that too rich) but with whole eggs. I first adapted the one by Milkmaid: 4 eggs is to 1 can condensed milk for the custard. I added either vanilla or lemon extract. Then I tried a Carnation recipe using 1 cup condensed with 1 cup water and same amount of egg. I was satisfied with the result as well. Recently, my sister-in-law has been milking her cow, so now my family receives a continuous supply, albeit for a limited time only, of fresh whole milk. Dad said we should be able to consume about 1 gallon a day, and suggested I make custard, pudding, etc. Since we also   have free supply of fresh eggs from Dad's farm, I decided to make leche flan. But I had to look for a recipe that made use of fresh whole milk. I used one which was originally a Cuban recipe. In my experiences, I have encountered some spoofs in preparing leche flan, which are often traceable to two major things: (1) wrong heat for caramelizing the sugar resulting to bitter caramel (a bit bitter is okay for me because it tastes like coffee), and (2) higher heat for steaming or baking (resulting to lots of holes and/or overdone custard that tends to be like pudding without the bread). So I chose the method of baking that gave me the best results to feature here in my foodblog. (I still don't have a big steamer here and I am not familiar with the double-boiler method yet. BUt in the Philippines I used to steam on medium heat for 30 minutes or so.) And since my in-laws were all praises for the two pieces I gave to them (my Mom actually requested for the recipe, saying it was unlike any custard she had ever had!), I am gonna stick to this one.  urlLink    The holes in this leche flan in the photo are just at the periphery. Inside it is soooo smooth and soooo yummy...just the way I love it! My Filipina friend here even commented that it was like professionally-made (oh, she also cooks, so coming from her, it is a compliment). While my Mom was praising it, she asked my hubby if he tasted it...but no, my fussy husband had always gently refused my offer (oh napakasakit sa dibdib! for me to enjoy this delightful recipe that my husband would not even taste...buti na lang impressed ang in-laws.).

      From Martha Stewart Living Mag:   SOFTEN MINERAL DEPOSITS - Place paper towels or sponges soaked in full-strength vinegar or lemon juice over crusty build-up around faucets. Leave in place for an hour or so. Then scrub deposits away.  KILL GERMS - You can safely and effectively sanitize countertops with white vinegar and hydrogen peroxide. Spray the surface with one, then the other, and wipe. It doesn't matter which goes on first, but keep them in separate bottles and do not dilute.  SCRUB AWAY KITCHEN STAINS - Make a paste of 3 parts warm water to 1 part baking oda. With a damp sponge or cloth, rub it onto the surface to be cleaned, then rinse. Use to clean laminate countertops and refrigerator surfaces, to remove grease from pots, and to shine chrome and stainless steel.

      When my hubby's family had one of their cattles slaughtered for our own consumption, suddenly I had a freezer-full of various beef cuts - ground, soup bone, steaks (minute, cube, top round, rib eye, porterhouse, tenderloin, T-bone) and roasts (rib eye, chuck, sirloin, etc.). We did not have cuts for stewing, though. My husband did not care for them. (But next time, I will ask that we have them, too. ) I panicked at the time...I had to learn how to cook which cut. As usual, the internet came to the rescue. Click on this post's title to see the fully-illustrated beef cut chart.  Beef.org have these as tips for home-storage of beef:   Refrigerate or freeze beef as soon after purchasing as possible.  (If it will take longer than 30 minutes to get it home, keep it cold  in a cooler in your car.)   If refrigerating beef, place it in the meat compartment or in the  coldest part of the refrigerator.   If purchased beef is wrapped in transparent film, it can be refrigerated without re-wrapping. It can also be frozen up to 2 weeks without  rewrapping.  For longer freezer storage, to prevent freezer burn,  repackage in heavy-duty aluminum foil, freezer paper or plastic  freezer bags, removing as much air as possible.   Label and date frozen beef packages, including weight and/or  number of servings.  Practice the FIFO inventory system   -  first in, first out.   Do not defrost frozen beef at room temperature.  Defrost frozen beef in the refrigerator, to prevent bacterial growth.  Place package on  a tray to catch any drippings and place in refrigerator the day  before it is needed.    Allow about 24 hours to defrost a 1 to 1-1/2-inch thick package of  ground beef or beef pieces.   Allow 12 hours to defrost 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick patties.    Allow 12 to 24 hours to defrost steaks, depending on thickness.    Allow 4 to 7 hours per pound to defrost large oven roasts or thick  compact pot roasts.    Allow 3 to 5 hours per pound to defrost small oven roasts or thin  pot roasts.    Cook ground beef as soon as possible after defrosting.    Refrigerate leftovers promptly after serving, within 2 hours  after cooking.  To speed up the chilling, divide large quantities into  smaller portions or spread food out in shallow container.   Remember that ground beef, beef for stir-fry, beef for stew and beef for kabobs are more perishable than whole muscle cuts (roasts and steaks).  During the grinding process for ground beef, any bacteria on the surface are mixed throughout.  Cutting into strips or cubes creates more exposed surface area for bacteria to grow on.  Both processes result in shorter shelf life.   And further has these beef-cooking tips:  Cooking Basics  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Getting It Ready Follow these smart handling tips when preparing beef.   Leave a thin layer of fat on steaks and roasts during cooking to preserve juiciness.  Trim fat after cooking.   Pat steaks, cubes and pot roasts dry with paper toweling for better browning.   To make cutting into strips for stir-frying easier, partially freeze beef to firm.   Salt beef after cooking or browning.  Salt draws out moisture and inhibits browning.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Keep It Clean To avoid cross-contamination and prevent foodborne illness, follow these easy steps.  Wash hands well in hot soapy water before and after handling meat and other fresh foods.   Keep raw meat and meat juices from coming into contact with other foods, both in the refrigerator and during preparation.   Wash all utensils, cutting surfaces and counters with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat.   Keep carving boards separate from other food preparation or serving boards.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Equipment Basics Having the basics and knowing when to use them can make all the difference.  Choose pans that are thick enough to heat evenly without scorching.   Size matters!  For best results, use the pan size specified in the recipe.  If the pan is too small and beef is crowded, browning will be inhibited.  If the pan is too large, overcooking may result.   Nonstick pans are easier to clean and they allow cooking with less fat.   When cooking with acidic ingredients, use pans with a non-reactive interior surface, such as nonstick, anodized aluminum and stainless steel.  Reactive metals such as aluminum and cast iron can affect the taste and color of dishes with acidic ingredients.   Place beef on a rack in the broiler or roasting pan to allow fat to drip away during cooking.   Use an oven thermometer to verify that your oven is accurate.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Adding the Heat The key to successful beef cookery?  Choose an appropriate method for the cut you have selected.   For tender cuts, dry heat methods such as grilling, pan-broiling, broiling, oven roasting and stir-frying are best.  Undercover cooking methods – braising, pot roasting, stewing – use moist heat and are better choices for less tender cuts.  For quick easy reference, see our table below.  Once you have selected a cooking method, follow these helpful tips for tender, juicy, flavorful beef dishes.  High heat can overcook or char the outside of beef cuts while the interior remains underdone.  For tender beef, cooked to the desired doneness, use medium-high heat for stir-frying, medium heat with all other dry heat cookery methods and low heat for moist heat methods.   Turn steaks and roasts with tongs, not with a fork.  A fork pierces the beef, allowing flavorful juices to be lost.   Turn ground beef patties with a spatula. Do not press patties.  Pressing causes the loss of flavorful juices and results in a dry burger.   Cooking times in our recipes and timetables are based on beef taken directly from the refrigerator.   Cooking times for gas and electric ranges are comparable.  However, since individual ranges perform differently, it is important for you to become familiar with your own range.   Grilling times in our recipes and timetables are based on charcoal grilling.  Because gas grill brands vary greatly, it is best to consult your owners manual for gas grilling guidelines.    Although I don't buy beef from the grocery store, some Filipina readers might find the following info from  urlLink USDA  useful:   Each USDA beef quality grade is a measure of a distinct level of quality -- and it takes eight grades to span the range. They are USDA Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter, and Canner.   USDA Prime, Choice, Select, and Standard grades come from younger beef. The highest grade, USDA Prime, is used mostly by hotels and restaurants, but a small amount is sold at retail markets. The grade most widely sold at retail is USDA Choice. However, consumer preference for leaner beef has increased the popularity of the Select grade of beef. Select grade can now be found at most meat counters.   Standard and Commercial grade beef frequently is sold as ungraded or as "brand name" meat.   The three lower grades -- USDA Utility, Cutter, and Canner -- are seldom, if ever, sold at retail but are used instead to make ground beef and manufactured meat items such as frankfurters.      My favorite websites for beef recipes are http://www.cabprogram.com/food/recipes.html and  http://www.beefitswhatsfordinner.com/recipes/default.asp .  Enjoy your beef!

      This has been a real favorite in our family since I experimented with the original Chicken Curry recipe (thanks to Sassy's foodblog!) to make use of beef (that's cheapest here and what we have in abundance). Using minimal beef broth and cooking slow brings out the full flavor of this dish, more so when the creamy goodness of the healthy coconut cream is added.  urlLink    Said hubby to me: "If there is a leftover, can I have it for my dinner tomorrow?" (When he says that, I know he means it when he says "Hmmmm, Honey, this is delicious!"

      I was supposed to post about Chicken Curry, but I realized I was not able to take photos of the cooking! Anyway, I will just prepare the recipe page for its beef counterpart. For today I  decided to post a recipe for baking: Cornmeal Muffins.  Cornmeal muffins are NOT MY FAVORITE muffins; they're my husband's. And while I like to eat it only fresh from the oven, my husband likes it cooled to room temperature. No other muffins will do for him (and no amount of experimenting with various muffin recipes on my part will convince him otherwise). So I am still sharing this recipe for those Filipinas whose husband's taste is as weird (?) as my husband's (he says I have the weird taste).  urlLink

      A reader left a comment in one of my posts:    "It's just like making curry, where a fair amount of coconut oil is used. This is very unhealthy."   I am not sure whether the statement was in relation to his liver ailment or not, but I have my beliefs about the coconut oil that I strongly hold on to.  I came from a country where coconut is so common. It has been touted as the "Tree of Life" ever since I was in elementary school. And before any non-Filipino (or even (educated Filipinos)criticize coconut oil in front of me (who is a big fan of it), I would want him to scrutinize the physique of those who use it (mainly Asians) and those who prefer to use the polyunsaturated oils (like olive oil) in the belief that the latter is healthier.(Americans used to be slim, the increase in obesity happened only in the most recent years, and this is not only traceable to their diet, but also a significant change in their lifestyle. Obesity is now a big problem in the US. )  I vividly remember a teacher of mine in Organic Chemistry when I was in my pre-med days in UP Diliman, who, during a time that we were making hand-made soap using coconut oil, mentioned that the reason why olive oil was preferred in making those popular soaps manufactured by multinational companies was not because it was inferior; rather, resorting to coconut oil would economically benefit more the local (Filipino) industries, and kill the olive oil industry in that parent company.   So with all the marketing strategies done by all the big companies to promote their products to compete globally, no wonder there is an abundance of researches (mostly funded by the companies themselves) that "scientifically prove" that saturated fats (like coconut and soybean oil) are bad for the health and increase the risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases.  So when it comes to fat, I would like to reiterate my stand: eat the minimal recommended amount of 5% (some recommend up to 30%) of your daily TCR.  What happens when we eat the (whatever kind of )fat is that it has to be emulsified by bile salts (product of liver, stored in gall bladder, released in response to the presence of fat/oil in the gut), in order to be acted upon by digestive enzymes and finally run in the bloodstream to be distributed in the liver and other tissues for storage or for energy production. Click  urlLink here  for more information on fat metabolism (choose Fatty Acid Oxidation and Cholesterol and Bile Metabolism).   I read and read a lot of publications online about the coconut oil because my intuition and the lack of solid and direct evidence linking it (saturated fats in general) to atherogenesis left me uncomfortable with all that propaganda against it. I just feel that the coconut industry (of Asians) is at a disadvantage in the global competition with the Western companies primarily because of vigorous marketing by the latter.  I was finally appeased upon reading several articles, both by Filipinos and non-Filipinos:   urlLink COCONUT OIL IN HEALTH AND DISEASE: ITS AND MONOLAURIN'S POTENTIAL AS CURE FOR HIV/AIDS   By Dr. Conrado S. Dayrit says  "...no evidence has ever been presented to prove that coconut oil causes coronary heart disease in humans. All the evidences presented have been in various species of animals who were given coconut oil alone without the necessary dose of essential fats or PUFA that should be given, just like the essential vitamins and minerals. On the contrary, the human epidemiologic evidence proves that coconut oil is safe. Coconut eating peoples like the Polynesians (Table V) and Filipinos (Fig. I) have low cholesterol, on the average, and very low incidence of heart disease.    urlLink Health and Nutritional Benefits from Coconut Oil: An Important Functional Food for the 21st Century   by Mary Enig, Ph. D. says  It is important to realize that at that time (1960s) the edible oil industry in the United States seized the opportunity to promote its polyunsaturates. The industry did this by developing a health issue focusing on Key's anti-saturated fat bias. With the help of the edible oil industry lobbying in the United States, federal government dietary goals and guidelines were adopted incorporating this mistaken idea that consumption of saturated fat was causing heart disease. This anti-saturated fat issue became the agenda of government and private agencies in the US and to an extent in other parts of the world. This is the agenda that has had such a devastating effect on the coconut industry for the past decade. Throughout the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, the anti-saturated fat rhetoric increased in intensity.  and  There is another aspect to the coronary heart disease picture. This is related to the initiation of the atheromas that are reported to be blocking arteries. Recent research is suggestive that there is a causative role for the herpes virus and cytomegalovirus in the initial formation of atherosclerotic plaques and the recloging of arteries after angioplasty. (New York Times 1991) What is so interesting is that the herpes virus and cytomegalovirus are both inhibited by the antimicrobial lipid monolaurin; but monolaurin is not formed in the body unless there is a source of lauric acid in the diet. Thus,  ironically enough, one could consider the recommendations to avoid coconut and other lauric oils as contributing to the increased incidence of coronary heart disease.     urlLink Coconut Oil: You Want a Food Loaded with Real Health Benefits? You Want Coconut Oil  by Ray Peat, Ph.D., posted in  urlLink Dr. Mercola's website  also gives me enough reason to stick to my practice of using coconut milk and oil as often as possible.  This page on  urlLink “The Tree of Life”: The Wonderful Health Benefits of Virgin Coconut Oil   lists several articles that prove such claims on the wonders of the coconut oil, which comes from coconut milk, which is an extract of the coconut meat.  And I am posting this today because I am preparing my recipe page for Chicken Curry, and I have tried using the ingredients for that using beef as well. My husband loves these dishes.  And to further defend my affinity to coconut, despite my love for coconut oil and milk, and despite having delivered two kids already, I am definitely within the normal BMI category, far from being obese, my lipid levels are within normal. And I am sure a lot of Asians are, too.  Oh,...in addition, coconut oil is also good for massaging; coconut milk is very good in hair treatment (applied on hair for 30 minutes under a shower cap about once a month).  I have not changed my belief that coconut tree is the tree of life.

      I have always used this sauce for burger in my attempt to come up with something like Jolibee's burger steak, which my children loved. But the Piquant Meatloaf recipe that I found on the net and which I recently featured (under the post "Two Meatloaf Recipes") included a mushroom sauce recipe to go with it (however, this is my own recipe). Though my (boring) husband would still prefer using ketchup on his meatloaf, I and my kids like this sauce. It is just so rich and yummy! And I am a big fan of mushrooms.  urlLink

      When I was still practicing as a GP in the Philippines, I often had patients who manifested with severe nausea and vomiting, and usually they came to the clinic looking very weak due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. History usually revealed eating food bought from  karinderya  or a fast-food restaurant (I had it when I bought king congee at a fastfood whose name I have forgotten -  tumatanda na ako!.   It offers Chinese dishes like siopao and pancit. Maybe some of you remember?) Some patients with the same symptoms consulted at the same time (My patients then had history of eating halo-halo bought near the talipapa.)By the time they consulted, they had gotten rid of the toxin, and once hooked to IV Fluids, almost readily felt better. They thought the IVF was a medicine, but actually the rehydration and restoration of electrolytes made them feel better, plus, the nausea and vomiting had stopped, which they often thought was secondary to the IVF but actually because the illness had resolved spontaneously. Well, the IVF also encouraged the highly-irritated bowels to rest.)  I recalled those events because of this eDiet Health Tip from My Yahoo:   Food poisoning can be downright deadly. Before handling raw poultry, seafood, meat or eggs, always wash your hands in hot, soapy water. Check to see that your refrigerator's thermostat is set to 40 degrees or below. Do not thaw foods at room temperature, but rather defrost them in the refrigerator. Wash the cutting board with hot, soapy water when using it for a variety of foods.   And I add: Always reheat thoroughly leftover foods that were refrigerated prior to consumption, especially if they had been cooked or prepared more than 12 hours. For mayonnaise- or egg-containing food like salad or some frosting, consume as fast as you can and keep refrigerated. If they had been sitting at room temperature for more than 2 hours, throw them away unless you intend to reheat them (I especially like toasting bread with mayo-egg or mayo-cheese using the oven-toaster).  To give you more information on Food Poisoning, read  urlLink this page  from the Merck Manual website.  You may also look at the  urlLink US FDA website  on the said topic, particularly for those etiologic/causative agents not mentioned in the Merck Manual.  If you happen to have the symptoms, be prepared to recall where you last ate and what items you had. So if you happen to eat at restaurants often, keep the receipts within at least 2 weeka. You may have to use them.  &nbsp; urlLink

      I have often used the microwave for reheating small amounts of food. One day, for lunch, I decided to eat the leftover rice and beef dish (heated separately), but thought of adding egg on top of the rice just because I miss eggs. I was wondering whether I could cook egg like sunny side up, without the hassles of frying on the pan (getting rid of the need for the unnecessary oil and having less to wash).  I usually reheat my rice by sprinkling it with some water and some chicken flavoring (excess from chicken noodles that my sons and which I as a child used to love) for 1 minute under high power setting. This time, with the egg, I decided to have it sit on top of the rice (which was in a microwavable plastic container), sprinkled some garlic powder, ground black pepper, salt and powdered onion on it, then set the time at 1min 30 sec under high power. Wow! I was so glad with the result: all white eggwhite and the yolk was just right for me (cooked on the sides but with a little gel-like consistency at the middle). Parang malasado! For those wanting a fully-cooked egg, maybe 1 min 45 secs is enough cooking time. But I am speaking here of cooking my egg with my rice (which, by the way, tasted like fried rice without the fat!).  I decided to have this method of cooking eggs for my sons. Then some thoughts nagged me. I recalled some issues before about the effects of microwave on hotdogs, etc. Though I haven't really thought that microwave is harmful to the food and eventually to the eater, my readings on the manual when it was relatively new technology (like how to use foil to shield some parts of the chicken so they will not burn) led me to infer that it operated on the concepts of photons being converted to heat energy (which I found out now to be erroneous). So I never really thought it was dangerous. Only now have I really tried to seek explanations on how microwave works. A Physicist I am not, but this highly credible  urlLink link by a university with Qs answered by a physicist  provided me with enough facts to be assured on using my microwave oven whenever I feel like it, and also gave me pointers on how to treat microwave-heated liquidsi with respect (I also heat up my milk for 1 minute using the microwave, heat a hotdog piece for 35 seconds, 2 pcs for 47 secs, etc.). I have tried heating a plate of foods but I was disappointed with the result, I ended up reheating each item separately.  This is egg microwaved on regular for 45 seconds, uncovered. Instead of poaching or boiling it, I preferred to use this method if only to be used in chicken mami noodle soup...  urlLink    And this is like a frittata where I used bits of hotdogs and ham plus chopped onions and tomatoes...  urlLink     I also tried microwaving to make mashed potatoes. My microwave had a setting for such. 4 minutes was all it took, no wasting of flavor because it didn't need submerging in water.  urlLink    &nbsp; For my hubby's dinner at work (I didn't tell him I didn't boil it. Baka maging prejudiced...):  urlLink     I have found a website before which featured microwave cooking. I wanna try that some time.  Other uses of microwave aside from cooking: kill the bacteria from sponges and washcloth if you are still handwashing your dishes. Put in microwave and heat for 1 minute.

      Sorry for the long absence. Aside from working on my gardens (flower and veggies), I have been working on my INS papers in past few days.So to make up for it, I prepared this page for 2 meatloaf recipes. However, I might still be a slowpoke in the following days, probably until after summer. I might post more often during the winter days, though, but right now, I want to enjoy the sunny days fully. (I feel so deprived of sunlight 2 months ago!).  We have a freezer full of frozen beef cuts (for 1-yr supply). (That is beef raised by my in-laws, grass-fed, lean, BSE-free!). For our share, we had 1/4 of the whole cow, 50% of which is ground beef because my husband loves burgers.With all those 1-lb bags of ground beef, I wanted to come up with dishes aside from burger patties. And meatloaf is a very good one.  The recipes featured are  Piquant Meatloaf  and  Raisin-Oat Meatloaf . Piquant Meatloaf is my husband's favorite. It is characterized by strong herb flavors, with a little spicy taste. Raisin-Oat Meatloaf is a result of my attempt to combine the classic meatloaf recipe with some healthy ingredients like rolled oats and raisins. The resulting taste is a sweet blend that appeals to my children (whom I am trying to feed with veggies discreetly).  While other people refer to veggies as extenders to most dishes like in egg roll and meatloaf, primarily to cut down on costs, I refer to it as extenders of life -- it is a healthy and tasty way to add fiber and vitamins and minerals to meat. Too bad my husband's taste buds can detect even the smallest addition of an ingredient that is new to him, making me stick to what I know he likes best.   I always prepare these meatloaves simultaneously to maximize the use of the oven and save on energy. I freeze some in portions just right for the meal, in reclosable freezer bags with minimal air to avoid freezer burns. I may serve it in the future as is, or I may cut each slice into 4 parts and cook it with mac and cheese plus chopped carrots and celery to create  sopas  (one of my favorite breakfast items in the Philippines).  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     To make a more balanced meal, I serve it with asparagus (sauteed in the meatloaf's gravy) and rice.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    The recipe page features how I prepared the sauteed asparagus as well. You can come up with your own styles of preparing veggies using your imagination.

       1. Top your cereal with apples, bananas, berries or raisins.  2. Bulk up chicken salad by tossing in grapes and sliced apples.  3. Apples won't weigh you down; take one with you to work for a snack.  4. Add berries or sliced bananas to low-fat or fat-free yogurt.  5. Citrus segments - oranges, clementines, tangerines and even grapefruit - are refreshing ingredients in green salads.  6. Instead of a candy bar, munch on mixed dried fruit (raisins, apricots, cherries, prunes).  7. Fruit slushies and smoothies are low in calories, delicious and satisfying.  8. Serve fruit wedges with a low-fat yogurt dip.  9. Make a "baked" apple in the microwave: Put a cored apple on a microwaveable plate. Pour a couple of tablespoons of orange or lemon juice around it, and put two teaspoons of raisins inside. Sprinkle with cinnamon, pierce and cook on high for five minutes.  10.Work melons into the beginning or end of your meal. Perfectly ripened melon slices make a tasty first course. Melon balls mixed with berries are a luscious dessert. Buy melons that feel heavy in your hand; check for a distinctive, sweet fragrance.  &nbsp; urlLink      From My Yahoo

      When I get parsley, chives, and other fresh herbs from the grocery store, I usually use only about a tbsp or  two, and I am left with a lot! Sometimes I also have celery sticks and bell peppers (leftover from parties) that I would hate to waste by throwing away. So, I store them for later use in making soups or spicing up sauces by chopping them, putting them in ice cube trays, filling with water then freezing. When they have turned into ice cubes, I place them in resealable plastic bags (grouped accordingly), ready to be used anytime! (It's the same thing I do with my frozen beef broth pre-measured at 1-cup amounts.) It sure saves time and money!&nbsp; urlLink

      This is my very first attempt to make a cake (this can be baked in 2 9-in round pans for 30-35 minutes), and prior to this I did not know that all-purpose flour can be used to make a cake! Not only that, I was surprised to find the cake to be moist and spongy. Maybe the boiling water did the trick.  I did not have round pans then, so I used my muffin tins. It also had an advantage in that muffin liners (paper) make it easier to eat the cake. No slicing, no dish and fork to wash. After baking them, I cool them completely then place in sandwich bags and store in the fridge, ready as snack items anytime. I keep the frosting in the ziploc bag, squeezing it out as cake is consumed.  The kids have fun sprinkling the decors. My husband loves bringing a couple to work. It is such a big hit in the family.  I usually make the frosting first before the cake batter. And I boil the water and turn on the oven as I start measuring the dry ingredients. This is to maximize the effect of baking powder on the cake (once mixed with the wet ingredients, the dough should be baked within 30 minutes.)  I think the boiling water here interacting with the baking powder is responsible for the big holes of the cake, thereby making it spongy.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      This is one of my husband's favorite seafood recipes (I only know of 3 seafoods that he likes: RED salmon, haddock, and Kippered Herring (canned). He hates squids, doesn't care for shrimps or lobsters or freshwater fishes or even tuna (which is sad because I love all those!).  So, since I have very limited seafood dishes which I can offer to him, I asked my Mom to share the recipe with me. The very day my Mom told me about how to make it, I prepared it for supper. My husband excitedly ate it!   The next day, my Mom asked me whether I have tried the recipe. And of course I told her about theo previous day. She was impressed that I made it the very day she shared the recipe with me! The impression they got was that I loved my husband that much that I was willing to learn from his Mom those recipes which he used to love so much when he was still living with them. (His ex never made that salmon loaf for him, and never baked rolls for him...)  [Click on the title to get to the recipe page.]  Well, what can I say?

      Beef caldereta is another Filipino dish that I found to be very satisfying to the taste buds of my husband. The liver paste makes it special. But I advice the Filipinas not to tell their Western hubbies about that special ingredient.   urlLink     In this photo veggies listed as optional in the recipe page are not included. I usually don't really plan on any meals. I just keep some ingredients in the pantry and fridge, see what I can come up with them, and voila! I prefer having at least bell peppers in addition, the pineapple chunks my husband does not particularly care for.  In this recipe I used the chuck roast, which is a very tough part of beef, but when slow cooked, is such a deliciously tender delight to the palate!  Other smaller cuts may be used, preferably stewing cuts, but steaks will do as well. However, for such smaller cuts, cooking will require a much shorter time (approximately 3-4 hours for 1 -to 1 1/2 lb less tender cuts, 2 hours for porterhouse, t-bone, cube or minute steak cuts. These can also be cooked on the stovetop (see Sassy's foodblog for Beef Kaldereta). Thanks to Sassy for tips on using liver paste instead of Reno liver spread (which I can't readily acquire here).

      Actually, mahaba ang litanya ng mga "bawal" sa mga taong may hayblad (high blood pressure po! aka hypertension). "Bawal ang maalat" is just one in the long list of pointers given by the doctor. (other bawals: mamantika, sigarilyo, especially when there's heart complications: bawal masyadong magpagod, bawal masyadong matuwa, etc., etc.)  Usually the doctor does not really bother to explain the why's of each pointer. Aside from being time-consuming (and there is a queue of patients waiting for their turn), the explanation can be so technical, and can lead to further explanations.  Pero sige, focus tayo sa MAALAT (salty) and its relation to hypertension.  Alam nyo ba, kahit sa medisina, me math? And that's not limited to calculating the charges for each item and hours spent&nbsp;during the consultation, the calculations for pediatric dosages...even during the first year of study, many would-be doctors would be dismayed to find out that they are not spared from&nbsp; mathematical (specifically physics, more specifically in this topic, fluid dynamics) concepts.   Blood Pressure has an equation:   BP = CO x PR  where   BP = blood pressure  CO = cardiac output (yung dugo na binobomba palabas ng puso), and  PR = peripheral resistance (this is the tendency of the arteries to resist the incoming blood from the heart)   This means that blood pressure is influenced by these two factors.  Cardiac output also has an equation:   CO = HR x SV   where:   HR = heart rate (bilis ng tibok ng puso)  SV = systolic volume (dami ng lamang dugo ng puso bago mag-pump)   If you combine the two equations,   BP = HR x SV x PR   So there are 3 factors that operate in increasing the BP:   HR - can be increased, for example,&nbsp;by exercise, extreme emotions like fear, anger and excitement   SV - can be increased by increasing the blood that flows back to the heart (ex.: elevate your legs, lie down, position yourself upside down, increasing fluid intake and  salt intake  - but these are usually temporary. The normal body tends to compensate through other woderful mechanisms to bring back the pressure to the normal levels as efficiently as it can)  PR - can be increased by decreasing the diameter of the arteries (kaya kung me atherosclerotic plaque, liliit and butas na dadaanan ng dugo), having stiff arteries ( ex. pa rin ang me atherosclerosis), vasoconstriction (constriction of arteries as in nicotine's effect on the circulation - kaya kawawa ang baby ng mga buntis na naninigarilyo)   (For more readings on blood pressure physiology,  urlLink here  is a good educational website by an anatomy and physiology academician)  In human physiology, the two major cations (positively charged&nbsp;ions)&nbsp;are Na (sodium)&nbsp;and K (potassium) ions. They directly affect the normal functioning of all cells.&nbsp; Na is the main cation in the extracellular fluid (nasa labas ng cells, meaning nasa dugo, in-between ng cells, basta wala sa loob ng cells). K is (nahulaan nyo na siguro) the main cation inside the cells. And when we talk of these ions, we are concerned about electrolyte balance (narinig nyo na siguro ito pag me diarrhea kayo at kelangan nyo ng oresol).  From  urlLink Martini's Anatomy and Physiology :   The total amount of sodium in the ECF represents a balance between two factors:    Sodium ion uptake across the digestive epithelium.&nbsp;Sodium ions enter the ECF by crossing the digestive epithelium through diffusion and carrier-mediated transport. The rate of absorption varies directly with the amount of sodium in the diet.   Sodium ion excretion at the kidneys and other sites.&nbsp;Sodium losses occur primarily by excretion in urine and through perspiration. The kidneys are the most important sites of Na+ regulation. (Kaya bawal din ang maalat sa me sakit sa bato.)   A person in sodium balance typically gains and loses 48–144 mEq (1.1–3.3 g) of Na+ each day. When sodium gains exceed sodium losses, the total Na+ content of the ECF goes up; when losses exceed gains, the Na+ content declines. However, a change in the Na+ content of the ECF does not produce a change in the Na+ concentration. When sodium intake or output changes, a corresponding gain or loss of water tends to keep the Na+ concentration constant. For example, if you eat a very salty meal, the osmotic concentration of your ECF will not increase. When sodium ions are pumped across your digestive epithelium, the solute concentration in that portion of the ECF increases, whereas that of the intestinal contents decreases. Osmosis then occurs. Additional water enters the ECF from the digestive tract, elevating blood volume and blood pressure. Thus,  persons with high blood pressure are advised to restrict the amount of salt in their diets .   Ngayon, hindi lang "maalat" ang equivalent ng "restrict the salt intake". In particular, pay attention to the sodium content of your food. Gaya ng MSG (monosodium glutamate), peanut butter, etc. To see a list of sodium-rich foods, click  urlLink here .  Gets nyo na? Kaya kayong me hayblad, WAG MATIGAS ANG ULO (If you still need more convincing to lower your BP, ask  urlLink doc emer  about the complications of HPN.)

      It's a sunny day today...and that means I willh ave the chance to stay most of the day outside!   Yesterday we had a bit of a thunderstorm. We (me and my sons) still pulled out weeds and tilled the soil despite the drizzle. At the end of the afternoon I wanted to harvest the beet greens but I was already getting quite afraid of the thunder and lightning going on around me...the procrastinator Manang thought of doing it the next morning (which is today). Lucky me!   So this is my harvest for today. A crate-ful of beet greens, leaving me wondering how on earth I would store the rest after consuming some of it while fresh. Mom said she just boils them and puts butter, same thing with other leafy veggies. Those which will not end up in the tummy right away will end up in the freezer bags.&nbsp;    urlLink      I'm hoping some Filipina visitors here would give me ideas. I am wondering whether I could use this is place of pechay, in  ginisa ,  nilaga , or even in  torta  or  lumpia .   Can anyone give me the&nbsp;answers?

      When you are not experienced with yeast bread, yet you love the aroma of fresh-from-the-oven bread, it can be quite hard when you are in a an environment where a bakery is at least 15 minutes drive away.  Good thing here is that there is this "wonder" machine called  Bread Machine , which was a wedding gift from my Mom. The first time I used it, and smelled the yeast working on the dough, my mind was flooded with memories of my childhood, the days I spent helping ( panggulo  at times) around at my  Tatay' s bakery. It took awhile for me to get used to it, initially just being limited to the recipes that came with the manual. Then I tried visiting www.breadworld.com as advertised in the label of the bread machine yeast I was using. Yeast breads then became a common item on the table.  So for Filipinos like me who are in foreign countries missing fresh-from-the-oven yeast breads, this is a good investment. One can easily train his/her fingertips in recognizing the right consistency of the dough prior to shaping by using the dough cycle. Once trained, baking yeast bread via the conventional oven becomes easier.  The good thing about bread machine breads is the small size of the dough, just enough for family consumption.   Fleischmann's website has a lot of recipes that are suited for beginners as well as for the more skilled, and also has recipes for dough setting only. My friend's mom, who lived in a different state and was here briefly to support her daughter when she gave birth, felt the need to buy a bread machine when I demonstrated to her how to bake pan de sal using it.  In my experience with basic bread recipes, I have also tried to use the dough cycle instead of the basic cycle so that I can shape them into rolls, or wrap them around sausages or hotdogs.   The recipe page only wishes to show the readers how a bread machine works (conveniently!) so they can consider having one, too. It is really a good buy.  urlLink    Among our favorites are: Basic Egg Bread, Basic White Bread, Mustard-Dill Bread, Herb Focaccia, Buttery Sweet Bread, Old-Fashioned Buttermilk Bread, and Fragrant Cloverleaf Rolls, all from Fleischmann's bakery (see the link at my side bar).

      I just remembered having read this sometime in the past, e-mailed by a friend...  Subject: A Matter of Taste by Matthew Sutherland  The following is from a British journalist stationed in the Philippines.  His observations written in 1999 are so hilarious!!!!   I have now been in this country for over six years, and consider myself  in most respects well-assimilated. However, there is one key step on the road to full assimilation which I have yet to take, and that's to eat BALUT.  The day any of you sees me eating balut, please call immigration and ask them to issue me a Filipino passport. Because at that point there will be no turning back.  BALUT, for those still blissfully ignorant non-Pinoys out there, is a fertilized duck egg. It is commonly sold with salt in a piece of newspaper, much like English fish and chips, by street vendors usually after dark,presumably so you can't see how gross it is. It's meant to be an aphrodisiac, although I can't imagine anything more likely to dispel sexual desire than crunching on a partially-formed baby duck swimming in noxious fluid. The embryo in the egg comes in varying stages of development, but basically it is not considered macho to one without fully discernable feathers, beak, and claws. Some say these crunchy bits are the best.Others prefer just to drink the so-called 'soup', the vile, pungent liquid that surrounds the aforementioned feathery...excuse me, I have to go and throw up now. I'll be back in a minute.  Food dominates the life of the Filipino. People here just love to eat. They eat at least eight times a day. These eight official meals are called,in order: breakfast, snacks, lunch, merienda, pica-pica, pulutan, dinner, and no-one-saw-me-take-that-cookie-from-the-fridge-so-it-doesn't-count. The short gaps in between these mealtimes are spent eating Sky Flakes from the open packet that sits on every desktop. You're never far from  food in the Philippines. If you doubt this, next time you're driving home from work, try this game. See how long you can drive without seeing food and I don't mean a distant restaurant, or a picture of food. I mean a man on  the sidewalk frying fish balls, or a man walking through the traffic selling nuts or candy. I bet it's less than one minute.  Here are some other things I've noticed about food in the Philippines.Firstly, a meal is not a meal without rice-even breakfast. In the UK,I could go a whole year without eating rice. Second, it's impossible to drink without eating. A bottle of San Miguel just isn't the same without gambas or beef tapa. Third, no one ventures more than two paces from their house without baon and a container of something cold to drink. You might as well ask a pinoy to leave home without his pants on. And lastly, where I come from, you eat with a knife and fork. Here, you eat with a spoon and fork.You try eating rice swimming in fish sauce with a knife.One really nice thing about Filipino food culture is that people always ask you to SHARE their food. In my office, if you catch anyone  attacking their baon, they will always go. "Sir! KAIN TAYO!" ("Let's eat!"). This confused me, until I realized that they didn't actually expect me to sit down and start munching on their boneless bangus. In fact, the polite  response is something like, "No thanks, I just ate." But the principle is sound-if you have food on your plate, you are expected to share it, however hungry you are, with those who may be even hungrier. I think that's great.   In fact,this is frequently even taken one step further. Many Filipinos use "Have you eaten yet?" ("KUMAIN KA NA?") as a general greeting, irrespective of time of day or location. Some foreigners think Filipino food is fairly dull compared to other Asian cuisines. Actually lots of it is very good:spicy dishes like Bicol Express (strange, a dish named after a train);anything cooked with coconut milk; anything KINILAW; and anything ADOBO.  And it's hard to beat the sheer wanton, cholesterholic frenzy of a good old-fashioned LECHON de leche feast. Dig a pit, light a fire, add 50 pounds of animal fat on a stick, and cook until crisp. Mmm, mmm... you can actually feel your arteries constricting with each successive mouthful.  I also share one key Pinoy trait ---a sweet tooth. I am thus the only foreigner I know who does not complain about sweet bread, sweet burgers,sweet spaghetti, sweet banana ketchup, and so on. I am a man who likes to put jam on his pizza. Try it! It's the weird food you want to avoid.  Duck fetus in the half-shell, items to avoid in the Philippines include pig's blood soup (DINUGUAN); bull's testicle soup,the strangely-named "SOUP NUMBER FIVE" (I dread to think what numbers one through four are) and the ubiquitous, stinky shrimp paste, BAGOONG, and it's equally stinky sister, PATIS.  Filipinos are so addicted to these latter items that they will even risk arrest or deportation trying to smuggle them into countries like Australia and the USA, which wisely ban the importation of items you can smell from more than 100 paces.  Then there's the small matter of the blue ice cream. I have never been able to get my brain around eating blue food; the ubiquitous UBE leaves me cold.  And lastly on the subject of weird food, beware: that KALDERETANG KAMBING(goat) could well be KALDERETANG ASO (dog)... The Filipino, of course,has a well-developed sense of food.  Here's a typical Pinoy food joke: "I'm on a seafood diet. "What's a seafood diet?" "When I see food, I eat it!"  Filipinos also eat strange bits of animals---the feet, the head, the guts,etc., usually barbecued on a stick. These have been given witty names, like "ADIDAS" (chicken's feet); "KURBATA" (either just chicken's neck, or "neck and thigh" as in "neck-tie"); "WALKMAN" (pigs ears); "PAL" (chicken wings);"HELMET" (chicken head); "IUD" (chicken intestines), and "BETAMAX"(video-cassette-like blocks of animal blood). Yum, yum. Bon  appetit.   Though food plays a major part in a Filipino's lifestyle, I am so proud to say that OBESITY IS NOT AN EPIDEMIC in this food-loving community!

      Last July 4 we celebrated Independence Day at my sister-in-law's house. We had grilled burgers, potato salad, orange salad and grilled chicken for dinner then home-made vanilla ice cream for supper. I thought I would share here how it was made, especially that it is still summer in most states, though I cannot do it at my own house yet because I have no ice cream maker at present...I have added it to my wish-list though...(hopefully my hubby will give it as a birthday present for me. :), but that would mean making ice cream sometime in the winter...:(  )  urlLink    Sorry I forgot to take a photo of the ice cream on a bowl...I was too excited to eat mine! For additional flavoring, bits of strawberries (or any fruit that fancies you) can be added.  Enjoy the summer!

      I thank bingbing very much for the following tips. I learned a lot from her (and still learning). She has been living the same life I have for 10 years now. I thought other Filipinas with the same lifestyle might benefit from it too so I am posting it here.   SPINACH- have you tried it with mungo or soup bone? finely chopped them then add to ramen noodles with diced carrots pero cook it as dry as pancit as a side dish. we add that also to rice-a-roni. (my kids love spinach. they don't love vegetables but they have no choice but eat them or else no dessert).   PLANTING KAMOTE TOPS and KANGKONG- put stem in water to root then plant them in your garden or plant them in a pot, take them out during summer and bring in the house before winter. (when bringing plants from outside, make sure the temp. outside is as close as the temp. inside the house so the plant will not experience shock).   AMPALAYA -i tried planting this one summer and i have no luck. but i think you can put them straight in your garden. (my husband suggest that you soak them in water then when it begin to sprout then plant them. then you will know if seeds are good or not).   right now i have tomato in a pot (inside the house)and i will dig my eggplant and plant it in a pot so i can bring it inside.   i used to have malunggay in the house planted in the pot then every summer i plant that outside but died just this winter coz of the burrow worm (?).   CANNING- i canned salsa and apple sauce. canning tips i learn is after you are done processing or pressure cooking your can jars (with goodies in it) tip it upside down and leave it 24 hours to seal it really good. ( OUR GOVERNMENT CENTER HAVE EXTENSION OFFICE WHO GIVE OUT INFORMATION REGARDING PROPER CANNING, FREEZING AND COOKING OF FOODS. YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE ALSO. SOME UNIVERSITY DO HAVE THIS ALSO, PARANG U.P.).  i learned also that you can cut your vegetables, put them in your canning jars, add water and a teaspoon of salt on top (sugar if sweetcorn) then process it. i will try to do this on my corn and greenbeans this year.   FREEZING- i tried freezing sweetcorn and greenbeans but the taste deteriorates. i only freeze tomatoes, i dice, drip, then lay them in cookie sheet, let it freeze then store in ice cream pail or put them directly in ziploc bags, put enough to make it lie flat in the freezer. (i do freeze a lot of cookies, pies,cakes, muffins, breads. either whole or in slices).   DEHYDRATOR, VACUUM PACKING- you can buy a dehydrator or use your oven (200 degrees) for tomatoes (slice thinly then drip dry), leaves of onions, dill, chives and the likes. it has longer storage life if you store them in the freezer after dehydrating.  i don't have a vacuum packing gadget but you probably see them in ads, they say it prolong storage life.   MAKING KIDS EAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- i make zucchini bread, pumpkin bread (i use squash sometimes)or bars, carrot cake, apple muffin or cake, blueberry coffee cake, muffin or pancake. (i don't tell them what's in it just let them taste them first).   in our garden, we have peanuts (kids love boiled peanuts) and okra. tried munggo but all dead due to weather.

      There was a comment by Bren (a food scientist) who shared that his lecturer said that anything without a liver has no cholesterol. Then it was followed by another comment asking if it was triglyceride then. (These were comments on my post about the coconut oil/milk, whose lipid (fat) content is mainly of MCFA (medium-chain fatty acids), which was metabolized differently from long chain fatty acids and short chain fatty acids.)  I was forced to review some Biochemistry concepts. With all the negative connotation about dietary fats, it is still a necessary constituent of our diet.   To answer the second commentor's question:  Triglyceride is different from cholesterol. A TG (triglyceride) molecule consists of a glycerol attached to 3 fatty acids. It is the form in which fatty acids, whether synthesized  de novo   from dietary sources are stored in all cells, but mainly in adipocytes (fat cells).   Cholesterol is an extremely important biological molecule that has roles in membrane structure as well as being a precursor for the synthesis of the steroid hormones and bile acids. Both dietary cholesterol and that synthesized de novo are transported through the circulation in lipoprotein particles. The same is true of cholesteryl esters, the form in which cholesterol is stored in cells.   Fatty acids in triglycerides and cholesterol are synthesized utilizing acetyl-coA.  The interrelated pathways in which fatty acids are used in the body for synthesis of some important chemicals is also coupled with carbohydrate pathways. The whole system is so complex, even I had a hard time trying to see again the whole picture (actually I only got to appreciate the interrelationships of all the metabolic pathways when I was already reviewing for the board. During the lessons in our first year in medicine, we studied each pathway separately, which was hard enough. To understand even a bit of the whole puzzle required that we constantly refer to another pathway from time to time.)I won't even try to talk about these pathways using ordinary language...that's just impossible.  For those interested, I leave here the links to informations on cholesterol and triglycerides:  http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/lipid-synthesis.html#triglycerides  http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/cholesterol.html  I would like to highlight the following from the site above:   ACC (Acetyl-Coa carboxylase) is the rate limiting (committed) step in fatty acid synthesis....Insulin stimulates ACC and FAS (fatty acid synthase) synthesis, whereas, starvation leads to decreased synthesis of these enzymes. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase levels also are increased by insulin and decreased by starvation. However,  in contrast to the effects of insulin and starvation on adipose tissue, their effects on heart lipoprotein lipase are just the inverse. This allows the heart to absorb any available fatty acids in the blood in order to oxidize them for energy production . Starvation also leads to increases in the levels of fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the heart as well as a decrease in FAS and related enzymes of synthesis....Adipose tissue contains hormone-sensitive lipase, that is activated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation leading to increased fatty acid release to the blood. The activity of hormone-sensitive lipase is also affected positively through the action of AMPK. Both of these effects lead to increased fatty acid oxidation in other tissues such as muscle and liver. In the liver the net result (due to increased acetyl-CoA levels) is the  production of ketone bodies . This would occur  under conditions where insufficient carbohydrate stores and gluconeogenic precursors were available in liver for increased glucose production.  The increased fatty acid availability in response to glucagon or epinephrine is assured of being completely oxidized since both PKA and AMPK also phosphorylate (and as a result inhibits) ACC, thus inhibiting fatty acid synthesis.  Insulin, on the other hand, has the opposite effect to glucagon and epi leading to increased glycogen and triacylglyceride synthesis. One of the many effects of insulin is to lower cAMP levels which leads to increased dephosphorylation through the enhanced activity of protein phosphatases such as PP-1. With respect to fatty acid metabolism this yields dephosphorylated and inactive hormone sensitive lipase. Insulin also stimulates certain phosphorylation events. This occurs through activation of several cAMP-independent kinases. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of ACC activates this enzyme.... When carbohydrate utilization is low or deficient, the level of oxaloacetate will also be low, resulting in a reduced flux through the TCA cycle. This in turn leads to increased release of ketone bodies from the liver for use as fuel by other tissues. In early stages of starvation, when the last remnants of fat are oxidized, heart and skeletal muscle will consume primarily ketone bodies to preserve glucose for use by the brain....extrahepatic tissues ( tissues other than liver ) have access to ketone bodies as a fuel source during prolonged starvation.... The production of ketone bodies occurs at a relatively low rate during normal feeding and under conditions of normal physiological status. Normal physiological responses to carbohydrate shortages cause the liver to increase the production of ketone bodies from the acetyl-CoA generated from fatty acid oxidation. This allows the heart and skeletal muscles primarily to use ketone bodies for energy, thereby preserving the limited glucose for use by the brain.  The most significant disruption in the level of ketosis, leading to profound clinical manifestations, occurs in untreated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This physiological state, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), results from a reduced supply of glucose (due to a significant decline in circulating insulin) and a concomitant increase in fatty acid oxidation (due to a concomitant increase in circulating glucagon). The increased production of acetyl-CoA leads to ketone body production that exceeds the ability of peripheral tissues to oxidize them. Ketone bodies are relatively strong acids (pKa around 3.5), and their increase lowers the pH of the blood.  This acidification of the blood is dangerous chiefly because it impairs the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen .     So for those who tend to be swayed by the different dietary fads, I suggest you just know your TCR and follow the pyramid guide. That will be simpler and will make more sense...GO BACK TO THE BASICS.  Oh...and please, don't forget the physical activity (actually this is taken into consideration when you compute for your TCR).

      NO recipe today...just wanted to share about what I did with spinach I harvested from my garden...    urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink      While washing I was imagining using it for tinola, ginisang munggo, and salad (in place of camote tops eaten with kamatis with patis and calamansi). I planned on eating it with fried rice and sardines. While taking out the leftover rice from the fridge I recalled the leftover lechon paksiw from my friend Ana, which she gave the day after July 4th (we shared it for breakfast, with my kids). I thought I would fry the rice using the leftover lechon paksiw, eaten with spinach blanched in boiling water, dipped with tomatoes, patis, spring onion, and lemon juice... Sarrap!  I don't feel the need to talk more about the nutritious spinach. We all know that already...It's just the season for it. I have 7 big bags of it now. I will soon have to store some of them for winter use...Thanks to a friend (balut) who already gave me some ideas...   urlLink

      These are strawberries from Mom, freshly-picked from her garden.     urlLink      I and the kids particularly liked the fresh strawberries mushed (in the chopper) and mixed with fresh cow's milk plus sugar...better than strawberry smoothie...   urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     And because harvesting is done every 4 days or so, and Mom has 100 strawberry plants in her garden, the buckets we received either had to be eaten right away, or made into JAM...    urlLink    Sweet and nutritious, strawberries are the first berries of the year. When picking, look for bright-red ones with fresh green leaves. Refrigerate 2 to 3 days, loosely covered. When ready to eat them, give a gentle rinse. Washing or slicing in advance will encourage spoiling.   Some tips from  urlLink www.mycustompack.com  :  Strawberries freeze well. You can do so with or without sugar. To freeze strawberries using sugar, mix equal amounts of sugar and water in a saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture is clear. Cool the mixture completely. Measure 1 cup (149g) of stemmed and sliced strawberries into a 2-cup-size (473.16ml) freezer bag. Pour 1/2 to 2/3 of a cup (118.3,157.7ml) of the sugar/water mixture into the bag,just enough to completely cover the strawberries. Seal and freeze the bag, keeping berries in a single layer.  To freeze strawberries without the use of sugar, set whole, firm berries on a cookie sheet, in a single layer and not touching each other, and place in the freezer. After berries are frozen, put them in a sealable plastic bag. This way they are 'individually frozen' and do not stick together.  Because the moisture content of strawberries varies throughout the season, it is recommended that home-frozen strawberries be used in beverages and sauces, not in recipes where liquid variations could make a difference. (Commercially frozen strawberries are consistent in texture and density.)  Thawing strawberries in the refrigerator will allow them to retain their shape better. When thawing at room temperature, keep the berries in a clean, sanitary environment. Cover and refrigerate unused thawed berries within two hours. Never try to speed up the thawing process by running water over the outside of the container, as that allows bacteria to grow. After thawing, keep berries refrigerated and use within three days. Never re-freeze strawberries.  While still attractive, thawed strawberries may be a little darker and lack the sheen that a fresh berry would have.  We consume about 1 small jar in 2-3 days, on Ritz crackers, or PB&J sandwiches, on pancakes, on muffins, and anything that suits us! Hope you too will enjoy your strawberries!

      Out of curiosity, I clicked on  urlLink Fleischmann's website featuring Pizzas and Calzones . What I saw reminded me of  empanada , so I tried this.  Though the original recipe called for pepper and cheese as filling, I used left-over chicken pieces (from beer-battered chicken that I prepared the previous day, the recipe page of which I have yet to make), mixed with chopped bell peppers and lots of cheese, seasoned with salt and pepper, for my fussy-eater mylab.  For me and my kids, I used bits of roasted pork (given by my friend Ana who had lechon recently), mixed with chopped bell peppers, cheese, and raisins, plus salt and pepper to taste. Mmmm....everybody was delighted, even the kids who had a hard time blowing at the piping hot center of the calzone! urlLink     urlLink    I have been asking my aunt to e-mail to me the  empanada  recipe of my Lola Miling in California, as she has made that her business. Though I am not inclined to engage in the same business, I gathered it must be a very delicious recipe that's why there was a great demand for it (hence, they made a business out of it). To my dismay, I still have not received the recipe.  I would appreciate it if anyone of you can send me recipes for  empanada . When I was in PI, my favorite was that made by  Merced  (not Goldilocks nor Red Ribbon): flaky and really yummy! I discovered that during my rotation in Veteran's Memorial Hospital where Merced products were sold at the canteen.

      My husband is used to having steaks flavored with just pepper and salt. The Filipina in me is not quite satisfied with just pepper and salt. So while I cook my husband's steak with just S&P, I cook mine and my sons' with spices or marinated, then let my husband taste them. So far his tastebuds have accepted and appreciated the new flavors, and actually have at times asked for the marinated/rubbed piece, but still goes back to that which he grew up with: steak seasoned with S&amp;P.  Well, I still love trying new flavors, and would still want to expose my children to a wide variety of food. I often tell my sons that when they grow up, I would not want them to be fussy eaters, as that would give their future wives a hard time. So I continue exploring.  I suggest other moms have in their pantry some of these spices in small quantities (it's always best to use them freshly made spices, than having all of them in big quantities but which will count years before total consumption). I usually get my dried spices from "Spice of Life" outlet near me. They sell these spices on a per weight basis, and at a much cheaper price than those branded found in grocery stores (Hannaford in my area).  Here are some spice rubs for grilled steak (from Cook Illustrated Magazine):   Chile-Cumin Spice Rub     3 dried chipotle chiles, stemmed, seeded, and cut into rough pieces, then ground together with  2 dried ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded, and torn into rough pieces 1 tbsp ground cumin 1 tbsp table salt 2 tsp sugar  Click on this post's title to see a pinter-friendly list of these rubs and marinades which I compiled from 3 sources.

      One of my favorites from my childhood days that up to now remains, and I am passing on to my children, is chicken tinola.  While in PI, our basic way to cook it is with veggie-combinations as either green papaya+malunggay leaves or sayote+dahon ng sili. A later variation that my mother came up with is using canned or fresh sweet corn plus young leaves of ampalaya.  Here in my place, I have not seen green raw papaya (my husband previously bought one that was manibalang and very sweet for tinola). Also no sayote. As usual, I have to make do with what is available and is now familiar to me. My recipe page also features a dish (poached chicken with Mozarella cheese) that I came up with exclusively for my husband (it's quite exasperating, but challenging nonetheless, to always think of a dish that will satisfy him without sacrificing my own and my kids' preferences), since he is not used to soupy dishes.  So I offer here a possible solution for those in the same predicament as I am in (lucky you if your husband is as open to new dishes as you are!).  urlLink     urlLink
