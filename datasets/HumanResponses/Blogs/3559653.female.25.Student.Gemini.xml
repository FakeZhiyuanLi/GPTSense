      Hi everyone! Sorry I haven't posted for so long, I just haven't really had the time. I've been busy with work and the gym and other things. Nothing exciting going on right now. I get to register for my classes tomorrow so I'm pretty excited about that!! haha, I'm such a loser, but I've always loved school so what can I say?! I'm taking mainly psychology classes, with a few stats and sociology classes mixed in (crim-related of course!). I think I'm going to be quite busy since my honors thesis will take up a LOT of time. Planning to get started on that soon but it's hard to find the time, especially considering how sick I was of school at the end of last semester! I was just completely wiped, it was so hectic. I'm starting a summer class next week so hopefully that will get me motivated to start work on my honors.   Still no definite plans for what I'll be doing after I graduate, but law school at Dal is definitely looking good. It's very discouraging trying to find a Canadian grad school with a forensic program that is actually taking grad students....WTF? Why even have a program if you aren't taking people? UBC has probably the best forensic psych program in Canada and it is pretty much dying out because profs are retiring and they aren't hiring new ones. I just don't get that! Anyway, there are only 5 schools in Canada with Forensic psychology grad programs and I know for sure that 2 aren't taking students, so that option is not looking good right now, but I'm leaving the door open. I'll write both the LSAT and the GRE in the Fall and apply to a few places and probably just take the best offer! Malcolm and I would really rather stay here vs. moving to BC, so hopefully that will be what happens.   Enough of that rant! I hope everyone has an awesome Canada Day. We're going for a hike at Taylor Head with Andrew and then a BBQ at Peter's, so we're keeping it pretty low key. I'm working Friday so that kind of limits our options. :( I'd better get going, just got home from the gym and I'm sure I could use a shower. :) Robyn's wedding is 6 weeks from Saturday (eeeeeeeeee!!!! That was a squeal, haha), so I've been trying to work out a lot and tan so I can look HOT! haha. More soon!  Princess Nook Nook

      Hi everyone! Well, yesterday was my birthday and it was awesome! There are many stories to tell but no time to do that tonight, so in the meantime, I'm going to post some pics! I've added some new pics of me, Malcolm, Andrew, and Kaspy at the airport, and I'll post some of the birthday festivities at work and at Merrill's. I'll update the blog as soon as I get a chance. :)

      Well, it's been a while since I last wrote but there honestly hasn't been much news to post--until now! Malcolm's buddy Andrew Kaspick has arrived from Winnipeg, and we are having a blast hanging out with him!  Andrew's flight arrived at around 4:20 yesterday afternoon, and we were there to give him a completely embarrassing welcome to Halifax! We took 3 flower leis from work (one for each of us to wear and one to put on Andrew when he came through the gate!), a bristol board sign that read "*Andrew Kaspick* Welcome to the Maritimes!", and a ridiculously awesome giant blue dolphin helium balloon that we named Kaspy! It may not have been a fish, but it was the closest we could get to a fish and figured it was symbolic enough to represent the Maritimes! After all, they don't exactly have oceans full of dolphins swimming around among the wheat fields in Winnipeg lol.  So after what seemed like an hour of being stared at, snickered at, having our balloon admired by every child under the age of 10, and being asked if we had "just flown in from Hawaii", Malcolm and I finally saw Andrew come through the gate at almost 4:30 pm. He looked happy to see us until he saw the assorted welcoming surprises, and then he seemed mortified, particularly when I put his blue lei on him and handed him the string that Kaspy was tied to! haha. We collected his luggage and made our way through the airport to get the heck out of there! Poor Kaspy just wasn't meant to be confined though! As soon as we got outside, the wind started wrestling him from Andrew's hand, and before we knew it, Kaspy had floated right out of his string-tie, and was sailing NOSE FIRST towards the airport! Malcolm screamed, Andrew and I yelled, and we all made a dash to try to catch Kaspy, but it was futile. After narrowly missing an encounter with a woman putting her luggage into her minivan (still nose first!), Kaspy sailed up up and away! We're pretty sure he caused quite a startling disturbance as he sailed past the air traffic control tower, but it was a hysterically funny moment. We watched him drift away for a few minutes and I tried to take a picture of him floating to his ocean in the sky (haha), but I wasn't able to get one. I was able to get a pic of Andrew, Malcolm and I all holding Kaspy in the airport, so I'll have to scan and post them when I get them back. For now, you will have to imagine Kaspy and his shining beauty based solely on the pic above!  Not much else to write, but I will keep updating all week. My birthday is on Friday--3 days to the big 2-5! Presents and donations of cash are more than welcome. :)  B.

      Let me start off by saying that I DESPISE this weather! I knew it was coming, it has been really humid for the past few days and today all hell broke loose weather-wise! It was 31 degrees in Halifax today, which was fine at work because we're in the basement of the building and it was cool. BUT, the apartment was absolutely   scorching   when we got home! The air conditioner will definitely be going in this weekend! It's not supposed to be as hot but I am not taking any chances!  Not much news, though I did find out that I made the Dean's List for the Fall and Winter terms...YAY ME!!! I never thought I'd see the day but I am thrilled that my hard work paid off! It seems like a lot of things are going my way school-wise so I hope I can keep up the good work next year!  My birthday is a week from Friday and I am going to be the big 2-5...I can't believe it, I feel so old! I am going to try to get an outing on the go, get a bunch of friends and go downtown for some beers and a good time! I haven't done that for WAY too long so it should be fun! Hopefully I'll get lots of presents, or just a lot of free drinks. :)  Gotta try and hit the sack, I'm working a 12-hour day tomorrow and need some rest. I hope I can sleep in this grotesque heat! More later. :P  B.  Word of the Day:   Gragon (Gra-gon) : Though this isn't really a sookie word, it was derived by the sook himself. It's a combination of the words "Grumpy" and "Dragon"...kinda described how I felt as I was sweltering hot and suffering through the heat at the laundromat tonight!

      I am SO loving this blogging thing! I think it could become addictive though, haha. Not much to write today. The weather was totally cold and shitty, but I guess I shouldn't complain. Soon it will be sweltering hot and I'll probably be complaining about that! I worked today and then pretty much took it easy tonight, cleaned a bit and just puttered around with the cats/fish. :) I'm thoroughly engrossed in the season premiere of "For Love or Money 2" (total 'reality' TV addict!), so this is gonna be a short entry!  Word of the Day: Snar-i-bou (derived from 'snuggie' and 'caribou'). Malcolm and I had caramel caribou ice cream for dessert so I think we know where that word came from! haha.  More tomorrow!

      Every day I will try to remember to post a new sookie word created by my silly, sookie boyfriend! He's very inventive and is always coming up with new words, lol! So without further ado, today's word is:  Sincess (  sin-  cess): A combination of two words - sookie and princess. I guess that's what I am! :)

      Well, here I go...I am going to give this "blogging" a shot! I've never even made a webpage, have no idea on the technical ins and outs of doing so, but this seemed easy enough so here it is!   Recent News:    It's a  beautiful  day here in Halifax, a bit cold, but we are finally getting some long-awaited sunshine! And do you think I'm out enjoying it? Of course not! I am cooped up here in the apartment instead, plugging away at a silly psychology assignment! Oh well, it has to be done and there will (hopefully) be many more nice sunny days to enjoy in the near future.   I found out last week that I have been accepted into the Psychology Honors program at Dalhousie ( YES!!! ), so I will be working on an honors thesis and graduating (yikes!) next year. I worked my ass of this year to get into the program so I am thrilled that my hard work paid off! I'm really excited about my honors project! It's kind of a spin-off on the work I have done in Dr. Porter's lab in the past two years, so I'm happy about that. Dr. Porter is my formal supervisor, though he will be on sabbatical next year, so I will be working mainly with Kris Peace, an awesome PhD student! The project will examine moderator variables of instrumental homicides in psychopathic and non-psychopathic homicide offenders--Kris has tentatively titled the project  "Investigation of the Psychological Correlates of Instrumental and Reactive Aggression" . I'm proud to say that my name is now on several of the lab pages, identifying me as Dr. Porter's honors student for 2004-2005! If you want to check it out, go here:   http://is.dal.ca/~sbporter/index.htm  Malcolm, Riley, Woochie and I are all looking forward to playing host to Malcolm's friend Andrew, who will be moving here from Winnipeg next week. He's taking a position at Thor, Malcolm's stomping grounds from last summer, and will be staying with us until he finds a place of his own. We're really excited that he's moving here! He's really into hiking and outdoors-y things, so we're planning on taking full advantage of that!  Not much else to report beyond that. Keep checking back for more updates! :)  Brianna aka Nook Nook

       Hi Everyone!!!  I know, I know, I haven't posted on here for a very long time, but I've been busy! This is just a quick update because I don't have much time. I'm taking a statistics class and between that and work and the gym and tanning and everything else that keeps me busy in my life, I just haven't had time for anything fun lately, like wasting time posting on here! :) I added a few pics tonight and I have a TON of others to post from the hike that Malcolm and Andrew and I went on at Taylor Head on July 1st. I promise I will try to post them this week when I get a chance. They are all really cool and I definitely want to have them on here! So yeah, that's it for now I guess. I am completely shocked by how fast the summer is flying by--4 weeks from yesterday until Robyn's wedding, 6 weeks until classes start, 10 weeks until the LSAT, ahhhh! I have no idea how I am going to accomplish everything I need to this year--and do well--but I am going to try my hardest! I've put too much effort into getting to where I am school-wise (which is a really good place!), so I won't let something silly like a crowded busy schedule mess things up! Anyway, enough for tonight, I have to keep plugging away at my hateful stats assignment. TTFN folks!  &nbsp;   Sookie word of the day:  Nookaragua ( Nook-a-ra-gua ): In Malcolm's words, this sookie word can be defined as "a sookie country run by princess nook nook"!

Andrea and Joey came too, and we all had a good time. Tabi & Holly wanted to draw stuff on my arms & hands and they went nuts when I let them (as you can see in this picture)! Luckily it was all done with washable markers, though I did have to pick up a prescription from the mall with my arms & hands looking like this lol!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    The crest of this hill is right near the beginning of the trail. Soon after it dips into the shady forest, which was nice, because it was VERY humid at this point. You can't really tell, but near the top left corner of this pic is the beach, and it is one of the most gorgeous beaches I've ever seen. Lots of white sand and very secluded. We stopped at the beach on the way back to the car at the end of the hike and I met a very friendly little brown bunny! He ran away before I couls nap a pic though.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Malcolm was the leader for most of the hike, though he was pretty nervous at this point I think! We were pretty close to the point and it was right around this spot that snakes slithered over his feet last year, haha! He was lucky that none got him on this side, but he did have an encounter with a large brown garter snake on the other side of the point that made him scream like a girl and nearly choke on his apple. :)&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I wanted a shot of Malcolm and I at the point or very tip of Taylor Head. It's so cool when you get to it, the air instantly gets misty and all you can hear are waves crashing. I think it almost looks like Ireland. Too bad that it was too foggy to see very far though, it would be a wicked spot to whale watch!&nbsp; urlLink

      Well, I can hardly believe this but here we are on August 4th!!! Where the heck did the summer go? I hate this time of year, it makes me grumpy, not just because it's so damn hot but because I always look back on the summer and wish I'd done more, saved more money (that should probably read ANY money lol), gone on a vacation, etc etc. Oh well, better luck next year I guess!  I met with Kris tonight and brainstormed for my honors thesis. It looks like we may have a snarl with ethics (one data set is from a study that is now closed, and we may not be able to use the other data set because the original ethics approval may not cover my study!), but Kris is optimistic and we're going to get an early start to avoid major problems. Kris mentioned a back-up plan--a study online having to do with sexual aggression and psychopathy--so I'm sure it will all work out. I would really like to stick with the offender data though since I find it really fascinating. I've been doing lit searches like mad and already have some deadlines to meet--first review of project proposal to Kris by Sept. 9th, then to Steve by mid-September, and complete intro. section for my thesis to Steve by end of September. YIKES!!! I'm wondering where I'm going to find the time but I think I can pull it off. I guess I'll just be up to my eyeballs in journal articles for the next few weeks! Looks like me and the laptop are going to be spending lots of QT together. :P  Needless to say, I've kind of switched my crazy standardized-test plans up a bit in light of how busy I'm going to be in the next 2 months. I'm 95% sure that I'll be doing the GRE (general and psychology) in November and the LSAT in December, it just makes more sense to me. I only want to have to write each test once so I'd better get cracking on some quality studying!  My hateful stats class is not over yet, but after tomorrow, only 4 more classes and one is the final! woooohooo! I don't think I've ever hated a class more than this one. I pulled off another 100% on my last assignment so hopefully those marks will keep me afloat if my midterm mark is that bad. I'm actually starting to get excited for my Fall classes, and now that I have this stats class under my belt, I'm not so worried about the psych stats class. I'm kind of looking forward to knowing what I'm doing when it comes time to analyze my data!  I'm starting to panic a bit about this being my last year. I hope I figure out what the heck I want to do soon! Probably won't know until December though folks, depends on those test scores. If at all possible, I am going to do nothing but travel and scrapbook next summer!!! I'm definitely starting to get excited about the possibility of going to Europe with Malcolm, and I'd love to get a Newfoundland trip in too--I'm obsessed with the idea of hiking the east coast trail! It looks awesome, check it out here:   urlLink http://www.eastcoasttrail.com/   10 days and counting until Robyn's wedding, I can hardly believe it's almost here! It's going to be cool to see everything come together after hearing about all of the plans for the last few months. I have my next dress fitting on Friday, and all I can say is that it better go better than the last one did!!  That's all for now...I'm wiped, must get to bed. Oh, the sookie word of the day is   SOMBIE  ...which translates to "sookie zombie" which is what I feel like right now. Miss you Snagon!!!
