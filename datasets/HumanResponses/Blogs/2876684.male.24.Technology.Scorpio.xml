      Well, Friday night was the big fight night I'd been waiting for and unfortunately both our guys lost on decision. Andrew's one was a bit dodgy because he'd been knee'd in the head twice and I'm still not sure whether the rules allowed knees to the head. Pete was fighting a much more experienced fighter though he got in some good kicks that almost buckled his opponent's leg - he did steal the show by almost throwing his opponent out of the ring when they tied up! (The guys sitting behind me started calling for chair shots... haha)  The quality of the fights was a step up from the last time I had been there, so it was pretty enjoyable - many of the fights were quite close and the final fight of the night turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax because it was stopped due to a cut sustained by one of the fighters. His opponent caught him with an awesome front kick that opened him up just above his eye, so the doctor called it off. Overall it was a pretty good night, my voice was hoarse after all the shouting though...  Mey and I had a bit of a journey on the way home, we'd caught the train and we thought it was going to Liverpool but instead we ended up at Lidcombe! So then I caught a train to Penrith from there and she caught a train to Cabramatta and caught a cab home from there. Public transport in Sydney... gotta love it.  Yesterday I went over to Mey's to reclaim my electric guitar (i.e. my baby), which has been sitting in her lounge room for ages because I thought I would be going back down to Melbourne and she was in need of some babysitting. After showing off my "awesome guitar skills" (more like "desperately in need of practice skills"), Mey and I watched this Indonesian flick, "Ada apa dengan Cinta?" or "What is it with Love?" that seemed to me like an Indonesian version of "10 things I hate about You" - even the lead actor looked like Heath Ledger (and not just 'cause of his haircut). Oh well, at least I got to practice my translation skills. Or rather I was sitting there catching the odd word here and there.  "Perempuan means woman!"  "Cinta means Love!"  And so forth...  After that Christine rocked up and the three of us watched the most confusing movie I've ever seen - it was this Korean horror movie called "A Tale of Two Sisters." (Korea's No.1 Horror Movie according to the VCD cover!) The three of us are still trying to figure out what it was all about, so I guess that pretty much describes the whole film. It wasn't that scary, but it didn't stop Mey from squirming in her seat even though she'd seen it already!   My ride home was yet again another journey... I was waiting at Canley Vale station for a train going towards Parramatta / Blacktown but after waiting for an hour I realised there weren't any coming so I hopped onto a city-bound train and changed trains at Granville. Geez, I need a car... any sponsors? :P

      I initially thought I wouldn't be writing a post in here today since I only woke up 3pm and obviously had only less than half the day left. However, today was probably as different a day from my normal routine as you'd get because I actually decided to skip training (hey, i felt crook when i woke up) and since it's Thursday, go SHOPPING! (Skipping training for shopping? God, what's next..?)  I actually spotted some nice shirts on sale at Westfield yesterday so I decided to run down to Parramatta to grab them and basically have a break for today - my body appreciates the fact I actually had some proper sleep this morning. Still more to catch up on, though. I had a chicken fillet subway sandwich on the way to parramatta and I realised that something in it leaves an aftertaste like cigarettes... Any clues anyone? I'm remember experiencing it before, so it definitely wasn't a case of someone leaving ashes in the ingredients while smoking on duty!  I remember now why I don't frequent shopping centres - they are dangerous to my wallet! Let's just say I bought more than just the shirts I saw yesterday. I rounded off my day by going grocery shopping at Coles in Penrith - now that doesn't really count as shopping twice in a day does it?  But anyways Shihan gave me a buzz to make sure I was alright because I didn't come into training today and mentioned that he ran the class into the ground today - sounds like I wouldn't have survived the class! Good timing on my part I guess...    Joel's random quote of the day:  "Don't be frustrated when you're surrounded by idiots - it makes it easier for people to recognise that you stand out from the crowd."

      Today was a nice change of pace, There was a possibility that I might have had to go work today, but I wasn't called to go in. *whew* Anyways, I spent basically the whole afternoon with Mey and Sheryl at Westfield Parramatta. We had a pre-lunch coffee and ended up sitting and chatting for a good 3 hours before we decided to move on! Lunch was basically the same thing and we stayed long past the cleaners had barricaded the seating area we were in at the food court. No I didn't panic, at least not much, haha. :P  I retract my statement earlier this week about the weather becoming good - it's been shocking! Cold and wet, just like Melbourne... *grrr* At least it's not blazing hot anymore I guess. Karate was good, small class again so we worked lots of self-defense techniques and the last 15 minutes were killer with shadow-boxing interspersed with pushups, situps, and leg raises. Ever try punching when your arms are fatigued? It feels like you couldn't hurt a fly...

      The past two days have seemed like one very long day... I've only had today to really think about things, so I guess this post will be a long one! I woke up at 5.30am yesterday to get a good start on the day, had to get in around 8.30am but I didn't want to chance being late because of late trains or whatever. In the end, I was 45mins too early, and my contact at NRMA HQ didn't show up till 9.00am. You do the math on how long I waited. I realised something while I was waiting in the lobby - one of the security guys there was the same guy who didn't let Christine into Minc! What a coincidence... well, maybe not really because Minc is right across the road.  As expected it was a long day, with a host of problems I had to deal with (which I won't go into detail because there were just that many...) and I worked from 9am till 5.30pm non-stop. Again, so much for the job being simple! Ray (my cousin) it's all your fault! But yea, it's been good actually apart from the workload, never thought I'd do any IT work before. And according to Ray, I've done well because the client and his own engineer were happy with me so I guess maybe it's a sign for a promising future in IT? :P  I was pretty beat after that, thoughts of skipping training flashed briefly into my mind but I'm glad I made the effort because it was a great class. There were only 4 of us so Shihan took a bit of a different approach to the class - he made us do all the cruel and unusual bag drills that I love so much, like lifting the punching bag onto your shoulder and throwing it onto the ground! (My feet are bruised from all the kicking as well, but that's another story in itself...)  Shihan made me recite the dojo kun (dojo oath) and I am very embarrased to admit that I didn't know it by heart - it was a huge wake-up call for me really... for someone who loves his karate so much, how can I not know the very principles that it stands for? After that, Shihan gave us a little talk on the dojo kun and what it means to him, and I found it very profound because after the grueling physicality of the class he ended it on such a different note. I almost couldn't hold back the tears... it reminded me yet again of the depth that Shihan has. People tend to write him off as a brute because he's a very physical man (and Maori too), but let me tell you this - you don't get your 6th dan in karate or any other martial art for just for being a brute. Last night's class was a perfect example. Anyways, here is the dojo kun for those interested:  http://www1.masutatsuoyama.com:850/dojokun.htm  Today was pretty much the same as yesterday, but the pace wasn't as full on and I actually got to have lunch with Mey who was in the city to pick up her necklace. Well most of the issues have been resolved and I might go in tomorrow just to mop things up. It won't be too soon when I finish though - if I see another computer with Windows NT on it I will scream!! (But yes I will sooner than I can imagine most probably...) Made it to kickboxing class late because I got held up at work but the guys are looking sharp for Friday, they're gonna kick butt all over Belmore RSL!!!  Oh, and I walked home in the rain. Luckily I had my raincoat. ;)

      Geez, just got back from the site where we deployed the PCs... apparently it wasn't as simple as I thought it would be, they were having complications with the roll-out of new hardware, which is why I was called at the last minute. Guess I should have figured it wasn't an easy job - I never get the easy stuff! :P  Anyways, they want me on-site tomorrow too since it's the 1st day with all the new equipment so I must find out where I can can borrow some riot gear on short notice. I don't know how people take to having their computers not working! (Well, maybe I am exaggerating just a tad...)

      Today was a very slow day... just trying to survive the heat out here in Penrith, apparently it peaked at 39 degrees. *ugh* So yes I've been bumming on the net the whole day, I briefly considered going out to watch a movie but the heat deterred me from venturing out.  Anyways, Ray (my cousin from Perth) called me up and asked me to do a last-minute job for him in the city - apparently he needs some PCs deployed so it's an early start for me tomorrow!

      Had a long day at the dojo today - got in early because a photographer from the Sydney Morning Herald came up to take photos of the kids' class. Shihan took us through a MONSTER first session mostly doing fitness and lots of fighting techniques. I couldn't bounce on the balls of my feet though (which is a typical karate thing to do when fighting) because of my freaking shin splints; actually I did bounce, but I just didn't leave the floor to minimise the pressure on the shins.  Then he had us doing bagwork for 30mins during the second session and I was just wasted. I don't care who you are, but if you go flat out for a 3 minute round on a heavy bag you WILL be tired. Luckily the rest of the session was relatively easy going, concentrating on counter techniques - the highlight of my evening was when John was supposed to defend my spinning back kick and after jamming the kick our legs tied up and he ended up on the floor! I couldn't help but smile to myself. :)  The train ride home was a bit uncomfortable because the train wasn't air-conditioned but I guess I dozed off now and then, which helped to shorten the ride a bit. As I was about to get off at Penrith this guy (who boarded the train with about 9 others at Mt Druitt) came over and started asking me about my iPod and he wanted to have a listen and I obliged, but obviously being wary if he tried to do a runner with it but he didn't. He gave me a friendly slap on the shoulder as we parted ways to indicate "you're alright". Maybe he initially thought he'd have a little fun with me I don't know - I find people to be generally nice if you are nice to them... this guy maybe crossed the boundaries a bit by "invading my personal space" on the train, but he didn't do anything to cause me to break his legs. So yea, I guess that makes him alright too?

      Today was pretty much more of the same old, except while waiting for the bus to get home from the dojo - this Chinese (as in from China) girl who was also waiting for the bus asked me the time. Somehow from there we ended up talking and I found out she stays pretty close by to where I used to stay in Surry Hills and that she goes to Wollongong Uni.  No, I didn't get her number. I didn't even get her name. Does that make me strange? Some people seem to think so! I guess I regarded it as one of those fairly anonymous chats you have when you travel. Maybe I was just tired from training. God I hope I'm not gay. No, I'm just SHY dammit. :P

      *Whew* It's been a long day! I left the house in Penrith to meet up with friends at Westfield Eastgardens for lunch and it took me 2½ hours to get there... (Yes, that included walking, train, AND bus. All I need to do now is take the ferry everyday and get the most out of my weekly travelpass.)   I was getting pretty annoyed because I received a phone call from Melbourne just after I got to Westfield, asking where everything was in relation to the Iraqi project and everything - obviously in the back of my mind I'm thinking, "Well, if someone had just bought my ticket as agreed I would have been there 2 weeks ago and sorted whatever needed sorting and everyone wouldn't have to go through this. AGAIN."  Anyways we stopped by a videogame store and Jenni (AKA Buffy Freak) spotted a Buffy game for PS2. Naturally, she wanted to buy it, despite the fact that she's leaving for HK in two days time and our protests...  "Buy it in HK! It'll be cheaper!"  "Don't buy it now! You won't even play it before you go!"  which were obviously were in vain, since she ended up buying the darn thing anyway. Damn Buffy Freak. Well, she did buy this "EyeToy"  , which I won't go into detail about because I don't want to leave any incriminating evidence that I actually used the thing. Haha! :P  Got to the dojo early today to help Shihan out with the front desk - he had sent Big John and Sensei Jon off to Rose Bay for the night just to have a change. He (Shihan) was still feeling a bit crook from something he ate on the weekend, apparently he was throwing up and stuff on Monday... never a good thing. However, Shihan being Shihan, his classes are always hard and I felt absolutely wrecked after training.  He was a bit upset with John though, because the front desk was in a bit of a mess and I realised it too after going through stuff - things weren't where they were supposed to be and we had run out of insurance forms (which every member MUST sign if they are to be included in our insurance policy). So yea, while it was nothing that major, it was enough to be of concern. I told Shihan I'd be coming in earlier to training just to sort out stuff like that. Poor John is always wrecked from training being an Uchi Deshi so he doesn't get much time in the day just to relax, so I understand how he feels.

      Got up REALLY late today... around 2pm because I didn't sleep till 5am - a bit of a slow start to the day, but oh well... Anyways, I made my way down today for Kickboxing at 6pm and still experiencing pain in my shins from skipping, I didn't really have a chance to ask Doc yesterday but the discomfort's nothing too bad, just hoping I'm not compounding any sort of injury that might lead to a fracture... (Obviously, Sensei Rosie's broken shin from Japan is still on my mind!)  Well, the highlight for today was when Tony was demonstrating how to do a proper low kick and ended up hurting John (not our "Uchi Deshi" or live-in student John, but this other guy) through the pad. Tony delivered a standard Muay Thai shin kick to the pad - the result of which was John clutching his thigh in pain and falling over! I dunno, I guess it was one of those "freak" or "sweetspot" kicks that do a lot of damage even though they're not THAT hard.  Tony (jokingly or not jokingly) said it's my fault since I was John's pad partner for the class so I'd already thrown some 200 kicks at him - he merely delivered the one that crumpled him. Oh well. Poor John.

      Damn, I'm going to have to learn some HTML to make this Blog look better... time to get off my butt. By the way, I'm quite impressed with MSN's audio conversation capabilities - apart from the inevitable lag, but I guess that's because I'm on dial-up as opposed to broadband.  So yes, I've talked to an ex-classmate in London and an old friend in Brunei in the space of 24 hours for basically nothing, which isn't too shabby. It's cooler today as well, which is a good start for the week!

      Grrr, I have these two scratches on my face from sparring last night from someone's long uncut nails! Trust me bleeding all over your gi is not a nice thing to be doing.  Well I've heard from my immigration agent that my residency application is nearing a result and I just handed in the last of the paperwork today - hopefully there'll be good news in the next few weeks!  Also been busy with the dojo move, we were digging up all the crap out the back today and I started reacting to all the dust *agh* and I was starting to feel REAL crap. Time and drugs helped get me back into shape before training though.  Kickboxing class tonight was pretty good - we're averaging about 20 people a class so it's pretty lively and has a good atmosphere. Oh, my partner for the night was the karate black belt who caught my eye some time back; she's started coming to kickboxing classes because she can't make the karate classes. Guess I'll be seeing more of her then... ;)

      There was a junior grading on this Friday and it was my turn to enter the sparring fresh against the junior belts and pressure them - i.e. give them a hiding. :P  It is different to be on the giving end that's for sure. But it's made me realise one thing... I'm gonna go down fighting at the next grading, those black belts better watch out!

      Gosh, I dropped another kilo this week... what is going on? I've been training hard all the time and my weight's never dipped more than 2kg, and that's only because of fluid loss after training.  This sudden weight loss is starting to concern me, hope I'm not killing myself slowly or something!

      I'd been feeling proud of myself over the weekend because of the amount of training I'd done in the week - today I had my first class with Shihan after a while and I was in a word, rooted. It was a small class and he had us on the bags doing 3 minute rounds and Shihan himself was holding a big pad. We were moving around between rounds and by the time I had got to Shihan I was exhausted, but he's got this way of making you go that BIT further - anyways without going into details, halfway through the round I was almost throwing up! (Anyone who's done anything physical beyond the point of exhaustion will know how that feels...)  But yea everytime I go through a monster session like this, a lot of self-doubt enters my head... I dunno, maybe it keeps me grounded and doesn't let me get ahead of myself. *sigh*

      Haven't been posting lately - very caught up with doing admin work at the dojo and training. In fact, probably training a little TOO hard. How does 300 pushups during a fitness class sound to everyone? I know, it's sick. Trust me, it wasn't voluntary. Anyways, I'm glad that my weight has dropped to a consistent 76.5kg now but that is probably more due to the fact that I've changed my eating habits somewhat.  Now to work on building some muscle...

      Yesterday was not a terribly good day for me - something I had eaten on the weekend was bothering me the whole day. I went to the dojo in the morning to train since I had my driving test in the afternoon (to get a NSW license because I still carry my Brunei license that doesn't have a photo).  The karate day classes are funny; sometimes there'll be heaps of people and like yesterday, there was 3 of us. Not that small classes are a bad thing, but I find they lack the energy of a big group. It also makes it hard for the instructor to conduct a lively class with so few students (in my experience at least). It sure was in stark contrast to the group of 42 girls from Sydney Girls who came in after our class! (They're John's pet project - he approached the school and asked whether they could use a martial arts instructor.) Anyways, these girls elected to do martial arts as a subject and they come into the dojo every monday morning. That is just M-A-D! I wish I got to do martial arts in school... *place big sook here*  When I got back to Penrith and made it to the RTA 20 minutes early for my appointment I got the feeling that something was wrong when I realised they had mis-spelled my surname on the booking sheet. When I brought this to their attention they asked me whether I had a birth certificate on hand because it is procedure to do so when correcting typos or whatever... since I didn't have it handy ("yea sure, I keep it in my back pocket so I can show people now and then") I drove back to get it since I had enough time before my appointment with the testing officer.  When I got back they realised that my current license does not have a date of 1st issue on it (well, I renewed it recently so it was issued last year) and they asked me whether I had my 1st license handy... I mentioned that it had already been copied and was in their system so I didn't need to bring it - to which the answer was, "Well i'm sure you were told you need to bring back all the identification you brought with you when you booked your license test, which includes your 1st license." Hello, my ID wasn't even CHECKED when I booked my license test... I felt like kicking up a fuss but the weird feeling in my stomach and the general bad vibe I got in the RTA prevented me from doing so. Besides, I like to consider myself a patient person.  Anyways, the testing officer wasn't too concerned with my documentation because she was concerned with who I was rather than the other nitpicky stuff - she said that stuff could be sorted out later after test. So we do the test and the result when I come back is a... FAIL, because I failed to come to a COMPLETE stop at an indicated stop sign on the road. Having driven for so long, you tend to take shortcuts when you do certain things on the road, such as not come to a complete stop but rather slow the car so that it is inching forwards, which makes it easier to get the damn thing moving again (I drive manuals, sue me) so you don't impede the 10 impatient bastards behind you honking like they're late for work the 5th time this week. Besides, you get good at spotting when there is NO traffic whatsoever. *sigh*  So yes I had to book another license test for $40. I could have used that $40 to buy more shirts. Or at least my groceries for the week. Dammit.  Today was much better though even though I'm still having trouble getting to sleep before 4am - I slept in till almost noon, which gave my body a much needed rest and leisurely got ready to go to training at 6pm. Training today was pretty good - I always enjoy kickboxing classes because I don't feel the pressure that comes with wearing a belt in karate. No one really minds if you're not giving 110% during class and you don't have the army-style discipline in karate that a lot of the pressure comes from (unless Shihan takes a kickboxing class, but that's a rarity these days).  My usual partner during kickboxing is Martin, who's been teasing me lately about fighting John Halford a lot. Now you see, John Halford is an AWESOME karateka and kickboxer - he's never lost to another Australian in karate competition and his record is like 80 wins, 3 losses. I'm not sure about his kickboxing record, but he does hold a world title in some category under some organisation. He was fighting in the Nationals where I fought at last year and was in the open middleweight (brown / black belts), which he won for the 6th straight year, and I was in intermediate middleweight (yellow / green belts). I've since graded to brown belt in December and it doesn't take a genius to figure out whose division I'm in this year.  The stuff he (Martin) says is quite amusing really. After I had gone through a sequence of some 160 kicks (blame Tony, our trainer), he said, "That's it, Joel! John Halford's shaking in his boots now!"  After class, Hector (who's Cuban and an Olympic judoka) decided to grapple a little with me - now I've only grappled in my life once before, and that was with Amir, who's Iranian and has been wrestling since he could barely walk. Obviously, Amir smacked me around on the mat that day, but I still managed to hold a bit of my own. Anyways, Amir and Hector grappled one day and he made Amir tap like a typewriter, or so I hear since I didn't witness it. Amir himself told me Hector was trying to kill him. (You tap out in wrestling / grappling when someone has you in a hold and you can't get out of it - it's usually accompanied by a lot of pain when force is applied!)  I don't really know how to describe Hector - he's not very tall but he is a walking heap of muscle, his upper body would put most bodybuilders to shame. Think Ken Shamrock people... (http://www.webcom.com/collectr/wr/images/wpshamrockk.jpg) but bigger! So yes he's strong, but this guy has got impeccable technique. I swear he was wiping the floor with me but without using any strength. He's quick as hell too, I squirmed out of some of his holds but he'd just have me in another one before I could think! He nearly choked me out on the last one too. *cough cough* I should seriously start learning some stuff off this guy...  Yes I feel good now after training; maybe it's the endorphin rush, maybe it's the fact I survived Hector, but I guess there really is nothing like a good training session to make the world alright again. :)

      I had a roast chicken salad at McDonald's today and the salad was pretty fresh, better than at most places where salads are pre-made and all soggy with dressing... all up, not bad for $6 but I think it only satisfied my hunger pangs for a little over an hour.  I guess that's Maccas for you.

      I've been out every night since Thursday - that makes it 4 nights in a row, which is something quite unusual for me!   Anyways, I went to see Kill Bill (Vol.2) on Thursday since it was the first night of screening and I came out somewhat disappointed - it was quite different from the first film and there was hardly any swordplay (which for me was the highlight of the first one). And there wasn't even a flashback of a certain psychotic, ball and chain swinging, schoolgirl we all know and love. :(  Friday night's training was cancelled because we had a social night at Moore Park. One of our students, Leigh, is the resident golf pro there and teaches at the driving range in the evenings, so we got together after his private lessons and swung a few. It's safe to say I was by far the worst at swinging the club, and it will take me another few thousand swings before I start to show any sort of consistency, but it sure does feel good when you get the mechanics right and the ball just sails away.  I went down to the Annandale Hotel on Saturday afternoon to check out this guitar expo they were having, which was really just a performance featuring the instruments (no we couldn't touch them). I was a bit disappointed, but it was a good afternoon of music - they had Diesel come in to play a few numbers, and the guy hosting the event played a really mean guitar too. He's probably a session guitar player or something, he was changing styles at will (country, rock, jazz, you name it) and he sounded equally good in all of them. Watching a performance like that can either seriously inspire you or convince you to stop trying. Good thing for me I didn't decide to become a professional guitarist, because I would have probably given up then. :P  I wandered around the city afterwards met a friend at Books Kinokuniya, who was on her way to meet up with her kendo clubmates to go watch Kill Bill (Vol. 2). I ended up tagging along and watching the movie the second time around made me appreciate it more - I guess Tarantino's films are like that, he uses a lot of subtlety and you can't really spot everything in only one sitting. Well, I'm waiting for the double DVD set to come out now. :)  Last night I went to the W Hotel (situated just right by Harry's De Wheels) for Sham's last minute bday drinks, and the cafe / lounge there is just awesome! I've never been to a place quite like and it's got really good atmosphere - perfect place to sit around and chill with your friends. Sham is really amazing, she knows so many people and it always boggles the mind how she can keep up with everyone. She basically picked up where we left off our last conversation even though I last saw her probably 6 weeks ago now - I wish I had a memory like that.  She introduced me to the guy she's currently dating and turns out the guy went to ADFA (Australia Defence Force Academy) and was an officer in the Air Force. I'm planning to enter the Air Force Reserves after I get my permanent residency so we had a good long chat about that - he thinks I can make it in without a problem, and I'm hoping he's right! I was also introduced to another of her friends, and it turned out we went to the same college in Singapore (I'm her senior by 4 years) and that she now hopes to do documentaries after she gets out of UNSW. What's even funnier is that her dad is involved in their church's media ministry in Singapore, which is exactly what I used to do back in Brunei.  Well I left a bit early (11pm) and grabbed a De Wheels hotdog before I headed home, and I still had to catch the nightride because I missed the last train out of central - the bus took longer than usual as well since the driver was making stops along the way that weren't necessarily on the route to let people off. A woman started bitching about how it was incoveniencing her and the bus driver got up and started having a go at her (which I didn't realise at first since I was happily listening to my iPod), but I did catch the last bits which were,  "The ride is incovenient for everyone and I'm trying to do some people a favour, and if anyone has a problem with that you can get off the bus and catch a cab home. I'm trying to make sure people get home safely."  And the passengers cheered the driver.

      Didn't realise I haven't posted anything since Wednesday, so I shall briefly recap what's been happening since then.  Thursday - Had a training session with Shihan and Michelle (who's also going to NZ) and it was a complete change from the day before, had lots of "zip" and my technique was a lot better, especially on my front kicks. Shihan and I did a run down to the chemist to pick up some supplements to help with my energy levels and the healing process.   Friday - Didn't do as well as on Thursday but training was quite different, lots of basics and little sparring. While on as physically demanding, it still is challenging fitness wise, actually I dare say even more so! Oh yea, and Shihan kicked me in the privates while demonstrating a technique. He didn't get me in the jewels, which usually makes you feel sick; instead, he got me on the top of my member and suddenly had this burning sensation I never quite felt there before. (I didn't feel any pain I guess I was in shock!) Thoughts rushed into my head like, "I'm bleeding! MEDIC!!!" But yea my gi didn't turn red or anything, so it was all good. It was scary for like a minute or so while waiting for the burning to subside!  After training Shihan and I went over to Chris' place for dinner - he's a close friend of Shihan's and also trains with us at the dojo. His mom was over so she cooked a big meal (typical greek, cooked for 3 but enough to feed 5-6 people!) and we watched a DVD after. It was 12am by the time we left so I crashed at Shihan's for the night.   Saturday - Had a bit of a lazy morning, Chris came over to fix a leaky pipe in Shihan's bathroom and we sat around and chatted for a bit. I headed off about lunchtime back to Penrith and rested in the afternoon before going to Mey's bday thing at Darling Harbour. Made my way down to the city and took me ages to find parking, which redeemed public transport for me once again (despite its crapiness).  I finally met Alan (as in fellow Bruneian, Alan) and despite what Mey and Sheryl seem to think, I don't see any sort of resemblance or qualities about him that mirror or resemble me in any way. Oh well, I did only just meet him so I guess I should reserve any final observations for now.  The Shelbourne was... um, interesting I guess. The DJs weren't much good and it wasn't just my opinion from observing the looks of bewilderment on the faces of people on the dance floor as the RnB DJ transitioned from song to song. The retro DJ didn't fare much better, he wasn't even transitioning between songs. He was also greatly annoying me with his overuse of the technique of pulling down the music to let the crowd sing along. It works well when used on a song where the crowd's really hyped - but even then not on every chorus! *place murderous thoughts here* I guess the only saving grace the Shelbourne had was that it had cheap entry and it's a hotel, not a dedicated club. But still...  Yes I'm really pedantic about music and how it's delivered - especially since I've organised dance parties and stuff before (and once upon a time live sound was my living). Did I mention the music was loud to the point where it was DANGEROUSLY loud? (I saw all the statistics flash in front of my eyes - max duration of exposure at "x"dBs, "x" hours.) I forgot my proplugs (special purpose earplugs) too, dammit.   Sunday - Basically sat on my ass the whole day, didn't help that I had a cold and felt like crap, must have been all the smoke from the night before. At least I managed to get a decent sleep for once.   Monday - Went to SAE (the college I graduated from) to pick up my degree certificate and as I was entering the front door, Lana (the so-hot receptionist) spotted me while coming back from her lunch break and called out my name. Now that's really funny because as I was walking in, I saw that she wasn't at the desk and I was thinking, "Aw, she's not around!" :P  Anyways, she graciously escorted me to the building adjacent to show me where Rene's (my ex-lecturer)temporary office is due to renovations. They're expanding the college and they've incorporated CGC (Computer Graphics College) into the building since buying it over last year. A shame really, because CGC had a great facility on William Street just 10 mins walk away. (SAE is just shit by comparison.)  While waiting for Rene to be done with another student, Veit, one of my ex-classmates walks in and we did a bit of catching up and he went into a long bitch about the state of the audio industry in Australia and how there is basically no work. (I feel better now for working in IT because I know I'm definitely not missing out.) I collected my certificate shortly after and all I can say about it is... I'm not sure what to say really! It's perhaps the most sorry looking degree certificate I've ever seen, my Certificate IV one looks more impressive. Oh well, it is just a piece of paper after all, but what a sad one it is - SAE, you've outdone yourself this time.  Onto training in the evening, and tonight I felt good. I was holding the big pad for John and usually he hurts me through it, but tonight I stood my ground and I even flustered him during the last round by hassling him constantly. He likes to keep his distance because of his reach advantage and I wasn't giving him any room... and boy, it felt good to be able to stand up to the stuff he puts out. :)  I still have a ways to go in other areas, but that one small thing made my night. Shihan was happy with it too, said I even had that "dead look in my eyes" or expressionless face that you strive to have. Reason for it is not to show your opponent anything and it sure as hell works. Hitting someone with everything you have and seeing them not even flinch sure takes the fighting spirit out of even the best of fighters.  Time to ice those legs and get to bed.

      I can safely say today was my worst day of training in a long time... probably ever. I felt so frustrated and disheartened I was close to breaking down into tears - I don't know what was wrong with me today, I didn't have any "zip" and even the simplest stuff took a lot of effort to do. On top of that, I fought like a complete amateur today, not like someone who's going to be competing in the open division of a full contact tournament.  Shihan gave me a ride to the station like he always does and before I go we usually hug, but today he held me a little longer and said, "It's okay buddy, you'll be strong - put today behind you and tomorrow will be a good day." I started crying right there and then, partly because of my performance tonight but also realising how lucky I am to be able to see the soft side of him that so many people don't see. He is a hardcore instructor no doubt, but underneath all that hardness he only has the best of intentions for all of us.  How privileged I am to train with this man.

      My weekend went something like this:  Friday - Trained with Shihan for a solid 2 hours. Wiped me out for the next 3 days, easy.  Saturday - Had lunch with my relatives, nothing too exciting. Ended up "guarding the fort" with Shane (my cousin Carmina's boyfriend) while they went shopping! Oh well, they haven't spent any real time together as a family since Carmina's moved out.  Sunday - Nothing of note, my body still hurt from all the sparring!  Monday - I went out shopping for PC speakers and came home with 2 DVDs and 2 new PC games. I briefly contemplated going to see "The Passion of the Christ", since it was Easter and all. But that changed once I got home and sat in front of my PC - damned tool of the devil!!!  I guess I wanted to accomplish more with my free time, but my body was racked with bruises and pain from the whole week of fighting - I initially wanted to train with Shihan on Saturday and Sunday as well, but I realised in hindsight I would probably be coughing up blood and nursing bruised ribs.  I wasn't really looking forward to training hard today coming off the long weekend, and Shihan didn't show because he got caught up with other things. John went through some stuff with me and I'm glad to say I'm picking up a lot of things from him. At this rate, I should be ready come Christchurch in June. :)  Fighting is so much more a mental game than it is physical - John proved that to me by not showing any sign of even being flustered after I hit him with everything I had. Apparently I had winded him good, but he didn't show me... and boy, did I feel useless at the time!  8 1/2 weeks and counting to NZ - make it count, man.

      Day 6 - Had a one-on-one session again with Shihan, and I've noticed that he trains John and I differently. When he's training John he works John a lot, whereas with me Shihan actually trains himself as well. I guess it's because he's easing me into full-contact fighting again after a long break, and he wants to regain some fitness as well.  Apart from that I feel a little strange training while the majority of Australia was on holiday today. For some reason I felt really isolated from the rest of the world today...  Damn Easter and all the chocolate - I can't stop eating the stuff because it's everywhere!!! *argh*

      Day 4 - Didn't have a real training session today since John headed back to Bathurst for the long weekend, but I did spar with Shihan for 3 rounds while waiting for some students to show up for private lessons. He wasn't going hard on my legs, but shit I'm finding it hard to walk straight!

      Day 3 of training - John showed me some tips in the afternoon before people showed up for classes, little things but very significant ones no doubt. I'm pretty grateful, my fighting needs to pick up 200% before I step out in NZ.  I was all padded up for sparring tonight and I felt like the Michelin Man for a bit, but that only meant that John could basically use more or less full contact on me, and he put me on the floor with a huge knee to the ribs. It was a pretty good hit, I went down with an almighty "ARGH!" that obviously had the others cringing...  Shihan wants to me to come up for more sparring if I'm not working over the long Easter weekend - so much for having time to heal! Oh well, it will all pay off come June. Count on it. :)

      I'm sitting with an ice pack on my leg as I type this... it's Day 2 of training for the tournament and we were going HARD. I haven't been hit that hard in a while, I almost threw up after getting knee'd and kicked in the gut by Shihan for not covering up - not to mention John was smashing my legs out from under me!  Dammit I'm always so hesitant when I fight I realise and it's a mentality from my non-contact sparring days. I need to get rid of that. Like right now.

      Today was my first day back in training after being out for a week with the flu and I can definitely tell my fitness has dropped from where it was before we moved into the new dojo - after a few rounds of light contact sparring I could feel a stitch in my right side... :(  Anyways, it's less than 3 months to the NZ tournament and Shihan has switched into tournament mode - he's told me to come up for extra training during the afternoons which I'll need for sure!  Oh that and I need to get my visa for NZ organised, but what luck! Philippine passport holders are NOT required to pay the visa fee which is normally $110. (Of course Aussies don't need to concern themselves which such things.) Wow, for once in my life that passport actually had an advantage... sorry if i'm oozing bias against my nationality, but talk to me about it after you've been in my shoes! *end rant*

      Hmm, just got back from watching the Shaolin Monks at the State Theatre perform and I feel a little disappointed... It was a good show don't get me wrong, but I suppose my expectations of what I was going to see were much higher - after all, the feats of the Shaolin Monks are nothing less than legendary.   I guess what I consider legendary has changed somewhat in the past year.  The fighting tonight was obviously staged and for someone who actually does fight for real it just looked uninteresting... I did appreciate the subtleties of the performance that a lot of people probably didn't pick up on though. I'd go into more detail but I shouldn't spoil for it other people.  Go see it people you won't regret it... and keep your eyes on the young ones - they absolutely rock! :)

      Dammit this bout of flu is pissing me off greatly... the worst thing is i can't get off my ass to train and that totally, absolutely SUCKS. I can't even be bothered to blog the very interesting but long weekend I had... *sigh*  Oh well, I guess I will mention that it involved throwing knives (yes real ones) at a sheet of plywood with a man's outline drawn onto it. Ah, what a strange life I lead... :)

      Hmmm, spent the evening re-arranging my room after I decided I should put my computer desk together instead of leaving it lying in pieces - so now I have two desks in the tiny space that is my room... but funnily enough it now feels bigger!  I guess it's because it doesn't look like a disaster area anymore - now I can get some work done in it instead of having to go to the library or something to sit down and write. :P

      Well, after spending about half an hour on the phone and an hour at the Qantas Travel Centre in the city, I have finally re-booked my NZ flights and am now going to Perth on the 14th till 19th June. I had to pay $200 on top, but at least I didn't forfeit my original fare of $400. Now THAT would have been really annoying...  Right now I'm sitting in the netcafe underneath McDonald's on George St trying to waste some time before I attend this launch of  urlLink Maya 6  at Hoyts across the road. The software was used in the movie, "The Day After Tomorrow" (and countless others), and we get a free screening of the aforementioned movie after the launch. Not bad, huh? :)

      Tonight's training was a little... different. Sensei Graham was in town so he took the senior class and we did 1000 punches and 1000 kicks! (Yes it jolted me when he said it!)  It wasn't so bad after all except I was getting a pretty good stitch on my right side. I was surprised I wasn't severely fatigued after, which I was expecting to be. After that the rest of the class he devoted to stretching, and I'm feeling pretty refreshed after it - good change after all the fighting training I'd been doing. :)

      Well today was a good change in the way things have been going the last two weeks - I dragged myself out of bed to get down to the dojo to attend the first aid course we had organised for the weekend.  The course was well run and concise, and fortunately it was shortened to a day's length instead of two full days as originally planned. So yes, I have half my weekend back! Still, I gotta complete my copy of the workbook and send it in for assessment before I'm awarded the certificate in senior first aid.  I was ready to jump on public transport home and Shihan asked me whether I was going to the kickboxing show at Town Hall and since I was broke I had no intentions of going. Well, turns out Shihan was given 4 ringside tickets to it, and he gave me one! It didn't seem like he was going to go anyways so I guess he would have given away all of them if he could have. (They're $150 a pop by the way!)  The night was pretty good - Town Hall is a great venue, but sadly they didn't pack the place, so the vibe was a bit dead. The undercard wasn't fantastic but the show definitely picked up towards the end with a war between the two lightweights  Reindhard Badato  (Australia) and  Hiroshi Mizumachi  (Japan).  Badato was strong in the initial 3 rounds and busted up Mizumachi's nose to the point he was bleeding constantly. Mizumachididn't seem to be very aware of the rules either as he was penalised for using illegal moves on quite a few occasions. However, he seriously picked up some steam going into the final 2 rounds and gave Badato a serious run for his money - ultimately Badato won on unanimous points decision (I expected that considering Mizumachi was penalised earlier on), and the Japanese crowd sure wasn't happy!  The main event was somewhat of an anti-climax as one of the fighters pulled out and was replaced by a relative unknown.  Nathan "Carnage" Corbett  who is a multiple title holder made short work of his opponent in the 1st round by ripping a hook into the poor bastard's ribs. I have never seen someone in that much agony from a single punch before... he was just outclassed.  Oh well, I took advantage of the opportunity to get an autograph and a picture as well, as you can see from my previous post.

      Okay, it's been a week since I was supposed to get paid and I still haven't received anything - this after hassling both the recruiting company and my cousin (whose company uses them) who is the project manager of this god-damned project I'm working on.  All I've discovered is there was some fuck up with the timesheets and no one can explain to me what happened or whose responsibility it was. Surely it can't be that hard to pay a measly salary to one resource when the whole project is worth multi-millions? Yes I know, it's all fucking bureaucracies and the number of hands that are involved.  It still doesn't make me feel any better, especially after what an exceptionally  FUCKED  week I've been having, compounded by the fact that I'm broke. Today I caught a cold too, how nice.  I'm just waiting for someone to try and mug me so I can beat the living hell out of them and break their mother-fucking legs.  I seriously mean that.  Then again with my luck, I'll be charged with battery and using excessive force not warranted by the threat.  I really need to break something right now.

      I've been reflecting about my situation and I've come to the conclusion that not going to NZ disrupted my "groove", so to speak. I've been bumping along fairly well the last few months - sure there have been rough spots here and there, but generally things have been good until I found out I couldn't go to NZ. Then things just all started falling apart for me.  The conclusion that I've come to is that not going to NZ stripped away my main goal for the moment, so suddenly without something to work towards I've been a mess physically, mentally, and emotionally.  I've also realised that I have a lack of goals I can directly work towards now, everything else is based around the approval of my permanent residency here. Once that's approved I'll come out with guns blazing, but for the time being I have to sit tight and wait.  Too bad I'm broke because it's the perfect time to be on holiday. :P

      It took me 2 hours and 40 minutes to get home today - must be a new record or something! I really need to move... *sigh*  I also tried to ring up the recruiting agency this afternoon to chase up my fortnightly salary and they were closed for the day. Why? Because they're based in Adelaide and today it is a public holiday in SA.  The gods must be displeased with me... but I haven't desecrated any temples/churches/mosques/synagogues recently!

      Argh, tried to change my booking for my now redundant flight to NZ and the Qantas people took my instructor's name off instead of mine! *grrrr* (I found out after verifying my new booking code online.)  Anyways, after calling them back and sorting it out we all have different booking codes now. So that means I can change my own flight without affecting the others, but I have to pay  $200  to re-book my flight plus any extra difference in fare since it was one of them "Red-E Deal" ones. Maybe I should just no-show like I said in my last post. *sigh*  Oh well I did buy my ticket to see  urlLink Steve Vai  at Enmore Theatre on 27th July. Woo hoo! It's been 10 years since he's been to Oz so it should be a hell of a show. :)

      It's been a shocker of a week - the following is a summation:  1. Had my leg seriously corked by John during sparring. I was in pain all the way home, and the leg is still corked now. That's all 6' 5" and 92kg of him below.           2. Found out I can't go to NZ for the tournament in June because of visa issues.  3. Realised the ticket was booked under special fare so it will cost heaps to re-book, might actually be worth just doing a no-show.  4. Missed a training session with  Danny Green  on Wednesday.  5. Didn't get paid on Friday like I was supposed to (great timing, I have $9 in the bank) so I had to call my dad to bail me out.  6. Withdrew money from an ATM on Saturday and had a seriously torn $20 note dispensed, even Maccas wouldn't take it!  Apart from all the above was having to sit through public transport which was just rooted. It consistently took half an hour extra just to get anywhere, and considering the amount of travel I do... well, you do the math.  Plus, I had the displeasure of breaking the news to Shihan about not being able to go to NZ. You could see the disappointment in his eyes, so much so that I'm probably more disappointed about him being disappointed than I am about missing out on the tournament.  Oh well, I live to fight another day - quite literally in this case.

      Today was one of those days... I thought I'd be able to get some sleep but I had to teach the morning class because John and Shihan were doing a course. So it's been my 4th day in a row on 4 hours of sleep and I definitely felt it.  I went to my immigration agent to sort out my trip to NZ and he basically said don't bother because it will definitely delay the processing of my permanent residency. So obviously I'm not going to do THAT.  Anyways a friend called up last minute asking for help to move because she had to move out by today (complications with the landlord), and as usual moving is never what you expect it to be. Plus public transport today was absolutely horrible and I ended up missing a training session with Danny Green (WBC Interim Middleweight Champion) at our dojo because of that. Oh well, better luck next time...

      I watched "Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind" today and Jim Carey plays a character named Joel. It was weird for me because I've never heard my name used so much in the space of 2 hours before. Not your standard movie I might add, it was written by Charlie Kaufman - so if anyone's watched "Adaptation", this film will probably remind you of it, at least in some aspects.

      Today I sparred John better than I've ever done, and I haven't actually fought him in a week! I haven't trained as well since I've been working, apart from just some pushups and squats.  Well to be honest, I didn't start the session off so well. But I took a moment to focus and give myself a little "mental re-adjustment", just before getting in the ring with John (yes we have a ring now!) and it worked wonders. :)  Watch out (at training) on Monday, everyone. *muahahahaha* (evil laugh)

      I've finally been called back to work this week and it's been good - I find it so easy to waste away when I'm not doing something productive. I even appreciate the brief break from Karate, it's given me time off to heal (skinned knuckles don't heal very quickly, just ask Uma Thurman) and get some of my motivation back as well.  After assessing my current state of affairs, I've realised that the NZ tournament looks very sketchy now because I'm expecting the approval of my permanent residency soon. If my predictions are accurate, it will be a case of not having a passport on hand to travel to NZ while immigration goes through the very elaborate and lengthy (4 weeks I've been told) process of sticking a permanent visa sticker into it. Oh well, it's no big deal... there's always the Australian Nationals in August, plus I've gone through too much and come too far to complain. It's insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  Cancelling flight bookings can be a bitch though.

      I went to a service at Hillsong Church in the city on Sunday evening with a friend to have a look and my initial impression was, "Woa, these people are media savvy!" It was like a mini rock concert - had projection screens, camera crew, the works!  I've always wanted to visit Hillsong Church because they are known to be one of the more dynamic churches around and all the techie stuff they do appeals to me as well. So yea, it only took me 18 months to finally get down there. Oh well... this weekend I'm going to their service in at their centre in Baulkam Hills, should be interesting!

      Well, tomorrow I fly off to Melbourne for the weekend after work and it was confirmed today that we will be flying to Brisbane on Monday to audit the sites there. It's a pretty big audit so we will probably be there for the whole week, too bad I don't know anyone over there...  Anyways my supervisor kindly offered me to book me a direct flight from melbourne so it will save me the hassle of flying back to sydney. The best part is my return ticket from melbourne to sydney is fully flexible so I just need to buy a cheap one-way airfare to melbourne for another trip! :)

      Well I went to see   urlLink The Punisher   and the cinema was almost empty when I walked in - it was one of the smaller 200-250 seat ones too so I guess it doesn't appeal to as wide a demographic as Harry Potter does. But then again, the comic book never did, to my knowledge.  But yes I was absolutely stoked to see that my all-time favourite scene from the comic was actually used in the movie. The man is good with a blow-torch! :)  After reading the countless blogs of girls who were drooling over the men in   urlLink Troy  , the first thought that came to my mind when  urlLink Thomas Jane  was shown without his shirt was, "Brad and Eric - eat your hearts out!"  Now go and watch the damn movie, girls! :P

      This is an extract of the email I received this morning:   On behalf of Shihan Phillips we wish to congratulate our Uchi Deshi Sempai John Sherman, who today was crowned the Grand Champion at the New Zealand Nationals.   Sempai John took out the Heavy Weight Division plus the overall tournament with some outstanding techniques.   We are also very proud of Michelle Albert who fought very well, showing  lots of guts and determination.   Do I wish I was there? Hell yes I do... but like I said before, there is always another tournament to compete in.

      To anyone who doesn't know already, Damien Dorall passed away this morning in his sleep - no one knows exactly what the cause is as of yet. If you're reading this and know him or someone who does, please pass the information along, his mom is definitely in need of some emotional support right now.  And as for you big fellow, we've had our share of good times and bad times together - I just never expected that seeing you in Sydney a couple of weeks ago would be the last time I'd see you... Rest in peace brother.

      I have lots of pet peeves, but I think the foremost would be people who only talk to you when they need / want something. Tonight a girl I knew messaged me about something and when I tried to start a conversation it was kind of like this...  "So how are you?"  "Fine."  "You know I might be in Brisbane for work one of these days."  "Ok."  Yea okay, I get the fucking hint. Why do I waste my time on these people? Can you spell "B-L-O-C-K-E-D"? *grrr*

      Well I'm supposed to be asleep but I'm looking for MIDI files on the web to use as my ringtone. I was quite disappointed to find out my new Motorola A835 won't play back MP3s as a ringtone. But I guess I was asking too much... I will probably settle for some cool sounding drum loop or something. No freaking cheesy melodies on MY phone!  But how cool would it be to have Megadeth's "Train of Consequences" as your ringtone? :P

      I caught the latest Harry Potter with a friend yesterday and to be honest I didn't really feel like going - I've never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the other movies before. Not that I thought anything bad about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, it's just that watching the 3rd part of an ongoing series without seeing the ones before is kind of like walking into a conversation that's been going on for a while already... (I also really wanted to watch the Punisher, but we'll talk about that later.)  Anyways after the movie I can understand the following Harry Potter has built up. I'm no critic so I won't try to appraise the film but I will say it was worth the $15 I spent on my ticket. Very few films I've seen lately can claim that!  I was also in Dirt Cheap CDs before watching the movie and there was this long queue at the counter because the POS (point of sale) software decided to crap out and they had to manually write down receipts using carbon paper. I observed them force-quit the software when it crashed and open it up again only to have it crash again. They were also running on Windows 98, so I suggested to the sales staff that they actually shut down the computer or do a restart prior to running the software again.  The girl at the computer replied with, "Yea I've done that already" with a "Get the fuck out of my face I know what I'm doing you cunt" kind of tone in her voice, so I get the hint and shut up and quietly wait for my receipt. Oh well, you try to help some people...   The other girl writing the receipts was more appreciative of my gesture and thanked me, I felt sorry for her though because she would have been writing receipts all day because of her smart-ass colleague.

      Hmm, I was thinking about my new job and I should consider myself lucky - I could still be struggling to make a living doing some shitty job somewhere. So yes work is demanding, but it's all good. I survived my first week of work with no complaints, it's definitely a step up, dare I say it... the corporate ladder. Funny thing is, I wasn't even on the ladder last week. Stranger things have happened I suppose.  Speaking of moving up in the world, have a look at this post a classmate of mine who's back in London wrote on our post-graduation forum:  -- OK, I've started to sink my claws into the studio now and working three nights per week. The Black Eyed Peas are in for a long stint (6 weeks) at the moment to coincide with playing most of the European festivals. The Libertines have just finished recording with Mick Jones (Clash) producing and Bill Price (Guns 'n Roses, Sex Pistols, Clash, McCartney etc.) engineering. The White Stripes are in next week - I think my "choice" of studio turned out to be quite alright considering the talent coming through these doors at the moment!  --  Woo hoo, I'm gonna know someone who's worked with someone famous now! :P

      I spoke with my "boss" (I just use the term because the working relationship is more complicated due to the bureaucracies of large organisations) today about my scheduled trip to perth next week and according to the schedule it will be quite full-on next week with audits of parramatta and hurstville sites.  I was hoping she would say I wouldn't really be needed but I know for a fact that both sites together have 500-600+ users, so it wouldn't be fair to leave them high and dry - especially my colleague, who is unfamiliar with both sites.  Oh well, I'm obviously disappointed because I was all hyped up to go and now I'm not. Plus I have to re-book my ticket AGAIN. Looking at ticket prices, I'll have to settle for a weekend trip to Melbourne to fit my schedule and as to not pay any extra for difference in fare. There's still a $66 re-booking fee though... *sigh*

      Whew, I commute all the way from Penrith to the city and where do I get sent in the morning? Parramatta! So I was given Cabcharge vouchers and jumped in a cab to parramatta from the city - I never realised it cost $50 in taxi fare... (you learn something new everyday right?)  So yea I still had to go back to head office in the city, so another trip into the city and then finally home at 8pm. (Yes I haven't been training lately, so sue me. :P) At least that was better than the guys who flew in from Melbourne this morning!

      Well it was the first day at work with the new job it's looking to be hard work over the next five months - the scope of the project didn't really hit until today when i started seeing all the numbers... anyone seen a spreadsheet six pages  WIDE  before? Oh and yea, there's like 9000 users who have to be audited too.  It's a bit strange for me because I don't have the relevant IT background but the reason I was put on the project was because I'm familiar with most of the sites it involves (at least in NSW) and just from today, I can see it would have been really hard for someone else to come in fresh.  There is another guy who's been contracted to audit the project as well - I'm glad I don't have to do it alone!

      Gosh, the wheels in my head have been turning and turning the past few weeks - so much that is constantly on my mind. I've been trying to figure out my situation and how to best approach things, I've even been very seriously considering whether Perth would be a better place for me to stay.  Anyways, today I get two phone calls about a job offer. It seems like my cousin has lined me up to be involved in auditing the project that I've been working on; the details are sketchy but it will definitely push me a few rungs up the ladder and I'll even be attached to the client from the sound of it. The duration of the contract is 5 months and the work starts next week.  Seems like the gods have conspired to keep me in Sydney for a while longer.

      I got a call from my agent this morning - they've received the letter of approval from DIMIA. I have to send in my passport and pay the remainder of their fee and in 4 weeks time... &nbsp; I'll officially be an Australian resident. &nbsp; I should be elated but I'm not - maybe it hasn't sunk in. Or maybe I told myself I was always going to get it so I'm not surprised. &nbsp; In any case, it's good news. I guess I've forgotten how to celebrate, that's all.

      I watched  King Arthur  today - I think I will avoid ancient epic films for a while. &nbsp; A shame really, this film had potential since it didn't stick to the standard King Arthur fable but all they did was fight, fight, and fight. Oh, and fight some more. &nbsp; A Jerry Bruckheimer film - 'nuff said.

      Well, today was an interesting day at work... about 11am I hear something come over the building PA and it sounded like they were announcing a fire drill. I ask around and no one else caught the message either, so everyone was like, "yea whatever".  Anyways a bunch of us head down to get some fruit juices and smoothies around the corner and as we walk out, a few policemen (one handling a sniffer dog) walk into the building -so I joked with one of my colleagues about how he shouldn't grow "plants" in the office.  Couple of minutes later as we're walking back to the office we hear the building alarms go off and people start streaming out of the building and head toward Martin Place. Apparently there's a suspected bomb in the building... so much for my audit deadline!  So yea after lots of drama and the police and fire brigade cordoning off a good block of George St we were finally let (cautiously, i might add) back into the building. As I walked back in I noticed a photographer taking pics of the crowd (should I say herd?) going back to work.  Hey I might be in the Herald tomorrow! :P

      Well I'm back after my trip to  Melbourne  and  Brisbane  - though I think the change in weather from place to place caught up with me after I woke up yesterday morning with a throbbing head and stuffy sinuses.   Melbourne  was absolutely  freezing , I swear I could feel the wind on my skin despite the fact that I was wearing a jacket! It really went by in a flash though since I had only stayed the weekend, though my last night there was interesting when I caught up with some of my colleagues who were there doing a deployment in  Collins St . After having dinner at a restaurant on  Lygon St (where we scored a free bottle of wine and garlic bread), we tried to get into  The Loft  but were refused entry on the grounds that we "weren't local". HUH? Since when is that an issue? Anyways, we figure it was because there was five of us guys. You can probably figure out why we weren't let in.  We ended up going to the  Men's Gallery , and my colleagues were quite pissed off because the strippers weren't stripping. Well they did if you stuck money in their garters but apparently in  Sydney  you don't even need to do that (or so I'm told). Anyways, we spent the night attempting trick shots at the pool table in the club. I don't know, but it just seems funny to me that we were playing pool in a strip club. :P   Brisbane  was really nice, the weather was great - especially after being in  Melbourne ! I was put up in the  Novotel  which is a couple of blocks up from the site I was auditing and even the second site in  Milton  was less than 10 minutes by cab. A really good change from commuting! :)  I didn't have much free time to do exploring and I was unsuccessful at catching up on my sleep too, but my bedroom certainly looks smaller now after having a hotel room all to myself all week. *sigh*  We managed to finish early on Friday arvo and caught an earlier flight back to  Sydney . My other colleague who left the office earlier to catch his flight back to  Melbourne  ended up leaving after us, and we know because we passed him sitting at the gate waiting to board (we were called for boarding already, haha).  I caught a cab all the way back to  Penrith  and guess how much the fare was?  $134.60!!!  Thank God for  CabCharge ! :)

      Ever feel like there's too much going on in your life to actually blog all of it? That's how I've been feeling lately. Work takes a lot out of me, by the time it's Friday I just feel so wasted - the commuting to and from Penrith sure takes it's toll. Good thing I've moved to Mascot as of today. :)  In any case, so much has been happening I haven't had the time to actually reflect and write something meaningful in my blog, so I guess I shall just recap my last week as best I remember...   Friday  Went out for drinks after work with one of my colleagues (well, he's actually a client because he works for one of the business units that we are servicing in the project) at MINC across the road and after 4 beers I'm totally gone despite many requests to stay I leave because I would have collapsed from exhaustion and alcohol induced drowsiness very soon.   Saturday  I slept. Not enough, though.   Sunday  The dojo had a little exhibition at Coogee Randwick RSL - despite 3000 brochures being distributed around the area, the attendance was pretty poor. I should also say the organisation wasn't great and it was rather last minute so I guess it was to be expected.  I had a short exhibition match and I did alright, though it really highlighted my lack of fitness - everyone was commenting how I ran out of gas in the bout. Well, 5 weeks of not training and 4kg of extra weight will do that to you.   Monday  A VERY long day, work was alright but due to the usual crap that sometimes crops up, I had to stay later than normal and fix up some workstations on short notice - only problem was that I was going to see Steve Vai at the Enmore Theatre! I made it with plenty of time to spare, but not having dinner and having to queue up in the rain didn't do much for my mood.  Pity it turned out that way, I would have enjoyed the show a lot more if I had enough rest to actually stand the whole time! (Yes I had to sit down even though I didn't want to because I was just so tired...) Vai was awesome and so was his band - all top notch musicians. A bit self-indulgent at times, but hey no one was there to see Steve and band play pop songs! The sound was bad though, I think the theatre's got some acoustical issues that totally destroyed Brett Garsed's opening set - totally turned me off even though the music was great. They really pushed the PA as well, things got so loud during Vai's set I heard distortion from the speakers! *sigh* It frustrates me more because it's supposed to be my "thing". Good thing I had my earplugs or my ears would have been fried - I can only imagine how loud it was up next to the stage. Poor bastards...  I ended up getting home at 1am, which wasn't really a big deal - however I hadn't packed because I was off to Tasmania the next day. Oh god.   Tuesday  Felt totally shithouse because I slept a total of 2 hours after getting home late from the Vai show and trying to pack up my stuff for the Tassie work trip. We get to the airport around 2pm and have a bit of a bumpy flight into Hobart - I swear the plane landed on one side first, I thought the wingtip was going to scrape the ground for a second!  We arrived in Hobart after 4pm so we basically couldn't do anything but check into the hotel and start work the next day. It was good though because my colleague and I got to have a good long chat with our supervisor about work and stuff in general. We seriously have not had a decent conversation together with her since we started at the beginning of June.   Wednesday - Friday  Basically capturing data from Hobart and Launceston sites, with a 2½ hour drive to Launceston. Tasmania is very sparsely populated - 6km out from the city areas and you're in the bush already, no kidding! I'm in a better mood after having decent sleeps in hotel rooms without having to commute - all the nice hotel food helped as well. :Þ  Despite our getting back to Sydney after 8pm, there was a huge queue for taxis and I ended up getting home around 10pm. My fare back to Penrith was cheaper this time because we weren't stuck in traffic because the driver didn't go via the city - only by $15 though. I will say this again, thank god for CabCharges!   Saturday  Tried to sort out through my stuff, unsuccessfully. Ended up bludging and sleeping most of the time.   Sunday  Panicked in the morning and just started throwing stuff into bags (which is what I should have done in the first place) and hauled my ass (and all my crap) down to Mascot. After that, I drove my dad's friend up to West Ryde to his sister's place and had lunch with them. Finally sorted out my stuff and put my computer back together (pretty obvious from this post!) and my new room looks absolutely fabulous - hurray for built-in wardrobes! :)  Oh, and my new address is... um, probably shouldn't put it on the net. Just ask me next time you talk to/chat with /see me.
