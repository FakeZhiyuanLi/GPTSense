      Rock is dead in Dallas (well, anything produced after 1985, anyway).  97.1 KEGL-FM The Eagle, the only contemporary rock radio station in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, changed its format from hard rock to light rock/adult contemporary on May 18th.  KEGL's new incarnation, Sunny 97.1, joins at least three other Metroplex adult contemporary (AC) stations in serving up daily doses of James Taylor, Richard Marx, Bob Seger and the like.  (Apparently, Clear Channel has reason to believe that Dallas radio listeners just can't get enough of Richard Marx.  Yay us.)  That means for now, rock fans in the Dallas market have two options - classic rock or alternative rock.  Dallas has two classic rock stations - 92.5 KZPS-FM (another cog in the Clear Channel corporate machine) and 93.3 KDBN-FM The Bone (owned by Susquehanna Radio Corporation).  KZPS offers the standard-issue classic rock playlist that everyone knows by heart:  Stairway to Heaven, Jamie's Crying, More Than a Feeling, lather rinse repeat, etc.  The Bone offers a little more variety and has a harder edge, but it doesn't play current hits.  As for 102.1 KDGE-FM The Edge, I'll just say this:  aren't Alanis Morrissette and Counting Crows  over  yet?!  You play them and their ilk over and over again while you STILL won't play the Dead Kennedys on the radio after twenty fucking  years ?!  You soulless Borg drones, how DARE you try to market this tripe to me as "alternative!"  Die, you baby-eating minions of Moloch!  DIE!!!!!!  But anyway . . . .  What is the upshot of all this?  Dallas rock fans no longer have any station that includes current hard rock or heavy metal songs in its playlist.  Which is ridiculous, considering that Dallas is the fifth-largest radio market in the nation.  A  urlLink story  on the format change quotes a Clear Channel muckety-muck as saying, "There was a great opportunity for a radio station like the new Sunny 97.1, and we believe this station will better serve the needs of listeners and advertisers in the Dallas-Ft. Worth community."  What the hell?  The Dallas area already has  three  other AC stations on the air, one of which (102.9 The Mix) is another Clear Channel station.  Wouldn't you think that the AC market is pretty well saturated by now?  Meanwhile, while they're chasing down the soccer moms and office drones, they've alienated an entire demographic with plenty of disposable income:  teens and young adults.  Yeah, I know the stereotype of people who listen to metal:  twenty-something guys with blue-collar jobs and mullets who spend their disposable income on tattoos, lap dances and bail bonds.  But many teens listen to metal too, and today's teens have a lot more disposable income then they did when I was their age (or at least it seems like it to me).  Perhaps the marketing people at Clear Channel believe they can keep their share of the teen rock market with 102.1 The Edge.  Still, it boggles my mind that Clear Channel would willing release its stranglehold on  any  portion of the Dallas radio market, even if that portion might be perceived as a less profitable demographic.  So who's gonna step up and fill the gap?  The exit of KEGL as a rock station leaves a pretty big gap in Dallas radio, and I can't imagine anyone not taking the opportunity to fill that niche. Perhaps an independent station will seize the opportunity, but most likely one of the conglomerates will fill the gap with a station of its own.  Even though, another corporate rock station will be better than no rock station at all.  (The Edge doesn't count in my book.  Sorry.)  In the meantime, all I can do is hit "scan" buttons and hope that Sunny 97.1 isn't playing "Copacabana" when the frequency comes up.  God knows I've suffered enough.

      I hate introductions.  You stand around, you shake hands, you smile and pray to God you don't screw up the other person's name.  You make small talk about the weather, sports teams, etc.; hoping to find that common thread that will lead you gracefully into a real conversation.  If you don't connect, you smile and nod and say, "Well, I enjoyed meeting you.  Have a nice time and I'll see you around."  One last awkward grin and you slip past each other into the crowd, hoping that you didn't seem rude or standoffish or socially maladjusted - even though "socially maladjusted" pretty much covers how you're feeling by then.  But if you do hit that common thread - whew!  You feel the pasted-on smile relax into a genuine one and you see the other person's smile do the same.  You start talking, then you feel comfortable enough to crack a joke and you relax even more when he or she actually laughs.  After a while, you forget about the awkward moments at the beginning and start looking forward to enjoying the other person's company and learning more about him or her in the future.  If you're fortunate, you relive the conversation five or ten years down the road as you share memories with someone who has become a treasured friend.  So that's where I find myself now - casting about for that common thread.  I guess I should start by telling you a bit about myself.  My name's Kelly, but my friends online call me Kel.  I'm 36 years old, I've been married for almost 15 1/2 years and I have a 5 1/2 month old son named James Douglas (who is sitting in my lap "helping" me type this).  Before I had J.D., I was a legal assistant at a large Dallas law firm, but for now I'm a stay-at-home mother.  Don't worry, this isn't going to be one of those blogs where every entry is, "Baby J.D. blew formula bubbles through his nose today and it was soooooo cuuuuuuuute!"  (On the other hand, I can't promise you that I won't post a cute-baby entry every now and then.  I am a new mom, after all.)  I like to think that I have a fairly wide range of interests, and quite frankly, sometimes my thoughts lead me to strange places.  (My friends who know me well are snickering right now.  Shup, y'all.)  I suspect that most of my entries will probably end up being "day-in-the-life" type essays, with an occasional rant and maybe some weird ramblings about topics that happen to interest me.  Depending on my mood, you're as likely to get a call for the return of allegory in public art as you are to get a rant about Lexus drivers who take up two spaces at the grocery store.  If you get bored with an entry, just skip it and come back soon.  Hopefully, I'll have something up that will interest you the next time.  And that's it for the introductions.  Most of the people who are reading this right now are already friends of mine, so I hope y'all will stop by occasionally to see what's new.  For those of you who don't know me, I hope that I managed to find that common thread.  And if not - well, I enjoyed meeting you.  Have a nice time and I'll see you around.

      Wow, it's been a busy couple of weeks. A new job, my baby's first road trip, and my first concert in eight  years  - no wonder I haven't gotten on here to post. Well that, and I've been loading fonts (Shup, Larry. You too, Stacie.).  Ah, my fonts - over 4,000 and counting. I found a site that had a bunch of really good ones that I didn't have, one thing led to another, and wham! I think after I get this last batch loaded I'm done with the font binges for a while; two weeks solid of unzipping zip folders and installing font files gets pretty old after a while. Plus, I have so many now that it takes an insane amount of time for the damn things to load. The sad part? I haven't done anything with them since before I had J.D. But hey! I have 4,000 fonts! Anyway, moving right along . . . .  We went to Oklahoma for our annual Memorial Day weekend trip with my parents this year. My J.D.'s very first overnight trip, and he rolled with it like a champ. (But I think he had more fun playing with his grandparents than he did out hiking.) We stayed in Ardmore, went to Turner Falls on Saturday and to Chickasaw National Recreational Area on Sunday. We spent most of our time hanging out at the Pavilion Spring on Sunday; it was hot and J.D. was tired and cranky. Inside the pavilion was cool and breezy, so we sat with him and talked, watched the people come and go, and dipped our feet in the ice-cold water to cool ourselves off. Monday morning we left at 8:30 in the morning and made it home by 10:00 so we had the rest of the day to relax. A very nice trip, but it sure was good to get home - it's pretty exhausting to travel with a baby.  The Saturday before, I started a part-time gig working with Cynthia, the attorney that my wonderful Natasha had clerked for during her last part of law school. Natasha hooked me up with Cynthia at her graduation party on the 15th.  Of course, it would be after two or three margaritas at the Blue Goose - yep, that's a winning first impression there (rolls eyes).  No matter, I went in on the next Saturday, caught up the filing and apparently made up for being drunk on my job interview - she bumped me up five dollars an hour on the spot and asked me to start coming in regularly.  Score!  And then there was the concert.  My husband Tony, our friend Eddy and I went to the Crossroads Guitar Festival on the 6th.  The highlights:  Pat Metheny, B.B. King, and of course Eric Clapton.  Before this concert, I had always been kind of mystified by the whole "Clapton is God" thing back in the late sixties and early seventies.  (Yes, God help me, I'm really that old.)  I had always enjoyed his songs, but could pretty much take them or leave them.  Now, I understand.  Clapton is fucking  brilliant  live.  My God, that man can play the blues.  Watching him play was a privilege and a revelation, and I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed it.  Now if I just could have seen Randy Rhoads *sigh*.  But anyway, you can see why I haven't been here for a while.  Thanks for tuning in, hope to see ya soon.  Kel

       Well, gluttons for punishment that we are, my husband and I decided to take another road trip with the baby. We spent a few days dithering over the destination. Tony wanted to drive to Tennessee, but we both missed West Texas and wanted to go back and check on the family farm that was sold in 2001. So we decided to make reservations at Palo Duro State Park and drive by the farm on the way up. This is the story of our adventure to West Texas. If you have a small child, read it as a cautionary tale. If you don't, read it as a farce.  Day One: Electra, Texas  I had a doctor's appointment at 8:30 Tuesday morning, so the plan was that we would get back from the appointment, start packing, then leave as soon as we were done. We planned on stopping for the night in Vernon, Texas - a smallish college town in the Texoma region, approximately halfway between Dallas and Matador, where the farm is. We had two nights booked at the canyon in the Cow Camp Cabins. The Cow Camp Cabins are four tiny cabins on the floor of the canyon, built by the WPA (or the CCC, possibly - I'm too lazy to go look it up right now) in the early 1930's. The pictures of the cabins looked wonderful: built of stone, featuring a fireplace inside and a barbecue pit and a picnic table outside. We also had a microwave, minifridge, two twin beds and a table and two chairs.  So we packed, and packed, and packed some more. Ice chests with food and drinks, J.D.'s Pack-and-Play (appropriately enough), picnic supplies, camping cookware, our clothes, J.D.'s clothes, so on and so forth. By the time we were completely packed, it was 5:30 that evening. We got onto the highway, just in time to encounter the aftermath of a particularly nasty traffic accident on Interstate 35. A backhoe had somehow caused a huge accident involving a police cruiser and an SUV. The policeman was seriously injured; we never did hear if he made it or not. Anyway, the backup was so bad that it took us an hour and a half to get from Carrollton to Denton, a trip that normally takes 30 minutes maximum. Once we got past the Lewisville Lake Bridge, traffic thinned out and we were able to continue on our way.  We went west from Denton to Decatur on Highway 380, then north from Decatur onto Highway 287 towards Vernon. I once had the sequence of the towns along 287 memorized: Alvord, Bowie, Bellevue, Henrietta, Jolly, Wichita Falls, Iowa Park, Electra, Harrold, Oklaunion, then Vernon. It had been so long since I had gone this way that I realized that I had forgotten some of the smaller towns, and transposed the expected order of others. The realization saddened me. We enjoyed the drive and watched the sunset fade into twilight as we continued north. We stopped at a rest stop somewhere between Henrietta and Wichita Falls so we could feed J.D. He was fascinated with the cars and trucks going down the road - we could see him following each vehicle in turn with his head as it passed by. Thirty minutes later, we got back out onto the road and headed towards Wichita Falls. As we passed through, Tony and I discussed whether we might go ahead and stop in Wichita Falls for the night since it was after J.D.'s bedtime. I really wanted to get to Vernon before we stopped, so we decided to continue. Uh-oh. J.D. started complaining as we passed the exit to the military base on the northern edge of town, and as we headed into Iowa Park, his complaints became insistent, angry cries. We pulled into a church parking lot and gave him a bottle. After he finished the bottle, we pulled back out onto the highway. All for not - 15 minutes later he started complaining again. Loudly. Continually. I turned around and tried to comfort him, but he wasn't having it. He was tired, and he wanted out of that damn carseat NOW. Tony kept driving as I kept trying to calm him down, hoping that he would finally fall asleep. Finally, as we drove past the town of Electra, we saw a sign: Food, Gas, Lodging - Next Exit. We took the exit, crossed over the highway and headed up the frontage road to the motel.  The motel sat next to a restaurant and a large gas station. The neon on the fifties-era restaurant sign was mostly burned out, as were the parking lot lights in the motel. We pulled up to the office and I got out to get a room. I pulled open the door to the office and was instantly hit by the strong smell of curry, which seemed quite out of place in the middle of rural Texas. I could hear the sound of a television in the back. I pressed one of the two buttons marked with handwritten signs stating "Press Button for Service" and waited. No response. Hmm, must have been the wrong button. I walked over to the window and pressed the other button. This time, a man came up to the window. I asked him for a room and he said, "There isn't any television or cable." At that point, since I was feeling rather bent over a barrel, I said, "That's fine" and paid for the room. I got the key, went back to the car and we drove down to our room. There was a car in front of the room immediately to the right of us, but other than that we were the only people in the place.  We got out, took J.D. out of his car seat (who of course had finally fallen asleep by now - grr), and unlocked the door. Again, I open the door and get hit with a weird smell - this time it was a strange sweetish chemical odor. Tony looks at me and says, "This room stinks."  "I know, but we're here now and we've already paid; might as well stay. It's probably the cleaners they use."  "Yeah, but it doesn't smell like cleaners to me."  "I know, but God only knows what it takes to clean up after those truck-stop whores."  Needless to say, we didn't eat much for dinner. I pulled a bottled water out of the ice chest to use for J.D.'s "nightcap," since I wasn't trusting the quality of the water that might issue forth from the sink in the dressing area. We turned on the television to see if we could in fact get any television channels. After much fiddling and adjusting, we were able to get a Fox station from Wichita Falls, so we watched Seinfeld and got ready for bed. (An aside: the cable box on the television had a built-in VCR deck, which was the first time either one of us had encountered such a thing. We surmised that it was there so the usual occupants could play pornos.) I put J.D. down for the night, settled in next to Tony, and soon fell fast asleep.
