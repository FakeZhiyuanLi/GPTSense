      good morning. sabi ko kay may pagdating ko ng opisina. good talaga kasi mabilis akong nakasakay ng dyip at hindi trafiic,at lalong hindi mainit...hindi pagpapawisan si kelly - kilikili ko (yuks kadiri to death!-arte noh?)   mukha namang okay si maria ngayong umaga. kasi kahapon hindi, pero mukhang ok naman. Ewan ko magulo minsan itong si maria eh. nakita ko kasi siyang malungkot kahapon, may konting luha sa mga mata, kala ko nga naghikab lang kaya 'di ko pinansin masyado. busy ako sa mailer - store brochure namin at corporate catalog. hoy talagang busy kami dahil kailangan na daw ipasa sabi ni jose.   kahapon kasi hindi ko na napigilang tanungin si maria kung bakit bigla siyang nalungkot. nag-away daw sila ng asawa niya. kaya tinigil ko muna ang ginagawa ko pansamantala. concerned 'baga. oo naman kasi isa si maria sa malapit kong kaibigan sa opisina na alam lahat halos ng mga sentimyento ko sa buhay at lovelife ko siyempre. humarap ako sa kanya (magkatabi lang kasi kami sa upuan) at ipinabasa sa akin ang laman ng inbox niya na galing sa napa-praning na asawa niya. eto sabi - 'uwi muna ako sa bahay namin para magpalipas ng sama ng loob..' tinanong ko si maria kung bakit. nagtalo daw sila ulit. hay palagi naman eh. konting konsuwelo lang naman daw ang hinihingi ng kaibigan ko sa asawa niya. wala kasing trabaho. nakatira sa bahay nila maria dahil ayaw pumayag ng tatay niya na malayo ang baby niya sa kanya. sweet ni tatay noh? bago magtapos ang usapan namin, sinabi ko na lang sa kanya na hayaan mo munang mag-isip ang asawa mo. nagse-self pity kasi, walang trabaho. bata pa nga kasi kayo. naga-adjust pa.   maagang nag-asawa si maria dahil buntis na nga kaya nung una galit si tatay sa kanya. pero nung naglaon natanggap na din. napag-usapan din namin kahapon na masama man daw isipin pero pinagsisisihan niya na nag-asawa siya ng maaga. okay lang na nabuntis kasi mahal naman niya si christian - pangalan ng anak niya. bata pa si maria, twenty-three lang siya kaya nga minsan natanong ko sa kanya kung feel na ba niya na nanay na siya. isang matamis na ngiti lang ang sinagot sa akin. alam kong oo kasi nakita ko na namang lumabas ang 2 magaganda niyang biloy. dimples po.helloooo (with a twitch on your lips) *wink   ako din parang gusto ko ng baby. mahilig kasi ako sa bata. isip-bata din kasi ako minsan. bakit? sabi nga nila, 'there's a child within in every person.'. o ingles iyun ah. pero parang ayoko ng asawa. hindi naman sa minamaliit ko ang kakayahan kong maging asawa. takot lang siguro ako. dami kasing gagong lalaki sa paligid. minsang makakita ka ng matino, hindi pa din pwede kasi...basta. basta baby ang gusto ko.   sinabi ko dati kay kis iyun. 'luvsy, gusto ko ng baby.' sagot ba naman sa kin, 'sige gawa tayo bukas.' AS IF! nagtawanan lang kami. naalala tuloy namin si sharon stone at ellen de generes sa pelikulang if these walls could talk 2. pelikula ito para sa mga kagaya namin ng uri. lesbyana. pareho silang mahilig sa bata kaya napagkasunduan nilang gumamit ng isa sa mga paraang tinatawag na artificial insemination. natutuwa talaga ako sa kanila. kyut.   siyempre mahal iyun kaya hindi pwede sa 'min ni kis. pero malay mo baka 'pag matuloy talaga kaming mag-abroad at makapag-ipon. siyempre hindi naman papayag ang 'asawa' ko na may lalaking ma-involve. siguro pwedeng pag-usapan. kasi hindi namin pwedeng ipaalam sa mga magulang namin lalo na sa 'min dahil panibagong isyu na naman iyon. alam naman na ni mommy kaya lang siyempre gusto pa din niyang magkaroon ako ng pamilya - tatay, nanay, at anak.   hay buhay...parang life. basta gusto ko ng baby.

      i'm opening my presents in front of the tree,  dad, and i look over to your chair  i look at the emptiness, dad, the space,  and become sad because you're not there   summer comes along with my birthday,  dad, and you aren't there with a big grin  my competitions come and go, dad,  you aren't there to see me win   i go into your room one day,  dad, and look at your empty drawers.  i go and visit you one day, dad,  and i see you, but the soul isn't yours   i feel you, and see you,  and touch you and smell you.  but you can't think, or drive, or work  or be my dad like you always used to.   why did this happen, dad?  i know that no answer will fit right.  i wish you could still be here dad,  i wish you didn't lose the fight.   why is God making you suffer,  dad, i'd really like to know.  i get to see your body and it tears me up inside,   i visit you and then i have to go.   i see your body, but yet it's not you,  and that's the hardest of them all.  no one understands, they think you are still alive,  they don't get why i always bawl.   it's like you die over and over,  dad, it is like a tease,  a constant reminder of something i can't have,  i am begging you please!   don't treat me this way,  God, I want my dad back  dad, if you're listening from wherever you are,  my life is perfect, but you i lack.   you are still here, so i didn't know  whether you are watching from heaven above  maybe you soul is there,  but either way, i send you my love.   --excerpt from Alana's poem To My Dad   HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DADDY. i miss you.

      tomorrow is daddy's birthday. t'was his second birthday he was not with us. he died last year--May 30, 2002. it still saddens me everytime i think of him. i guess because death is something we all share--even if we know that we are also headed there, we are pained by the fact that there are others who will leave us ahead. we do not have answers as to why what has happened was made part of the greater scheme of things, not even have assurances of a greater scheme of things.   so, there is only for me to enjoy the moment, live my life in the way that I want it lived. And maybe this IS the greater scheme of things--that we are meant to make our lives as beautiful, and as fulfilling, as they can get.   I don't really know.   On Death, without Exaggeration  Wislawa Szymborska   It can't take a joke,  find a star, make a bridge.  It knows nothing about weaving, mining, farming,  building ships, or baking cakes.   In our planning for tomorrow,  it has the final word,  which is always beside the point.   It can't even get the things done  that are part of its trade:  dig a grave,  make a coffin,  clean up after itself.   Preoccupied with killing,  it does the job awkwardly,  without system or skill.  As though each of us were its first kill.   Oh, it has its triumphs,  but look at its countless defeats,  missed blows,  and repeat attempts!   Sometimes it isn't strong enough  to swat a fly from the air.  Many are the caterpillars  that have outcrawled it.   All those bulbs, pods,  tentacles, fins, tracheae,  nuptial plumage, and winter fur  show that it has fallen behind  with its halfhearted work.   Ill will won't help  and even our lending a hand with wars and coups d'etat  is so far not enough.   Hearts beat inside eggs.  Babies' skeletons grow.  Seeds, hard at work, sprout their first tiny pair of leaves  and sometimes even tall trees fall away.   Whoever claims that it's omnipotent  is himself living proof  that it's not.   There's no life  that couldn't be immortal  if only for a moment.   Death  always arrives by that very moment too late.   In vain it tugs at the knob  of the invisible door.  As far as you've come  can't be undone.    i also want to offer a nice poem to a great man--Alexander Santiago (youngest son of Former Senator Miriam Defensor Santaigo)   Psalm and Lament  by Donald Justice    The clocks are sorry, the clocks are very sad.  One stops, one goes on striking the wrong hours.   And the grass burns terribly in the sun,  The grass turns yellow secretly at the roots.   Now suddenly the yard chairs look empty, the sky looks empty,  The sky looks vast and empty.   Out on Red Road the traffic continues; everything continues.  Nor does memory sleep; it goes on.   Out spring the butterflies of recollection,  And I think that for the first time I understand   The beautiful ordinary light of this patio  And even perhaps the dark rich earth of a heart.   (The bedclothes, they say, had been pulled down.  I will not describe it. I do not want to describe it.   No, but the sheets were drenched and twisted.  They were the very handkerchiefs of grief.)   Let summer come now with its schoolboy trumpets and fountains.  But the years are gone, the years are finally over.   And there is only  This long desolation of flower-bordered sidewalks   That runs to the corner, turns, and goes on,  That disappears and goes on   Into the black oblivion of a neighborhood and a world  Without billboards or yesterdays.   Sometimes a sad moon comes and waters the roof tiles.  But the years are gone. There are no more years

      my favorite cat in the world - garfield. Have a sizeable collection of garfield stuffs from pens to bags...Yihee! Actually I started collecting Felix The Cat, then Hello Kitty, then comes Garfield. So you see, cats are around me ever since. But i must admit, i do not own a cat, not a single one...   Want to share with you the history of this famous cat.   Garfield was born June 19, 1978 (i'm 2months and 14 days older than my cat!) in the kitchen of Mama Leone's Italian restaurant. He was 5 pounds 6 ounces - that's big for a kitten! - and ever since then he loved Italian food. The restaurant owner, forced to choose between Garfield and closing his doors for lack of pasta, sold Garfield to a pet store. Garfield thought he was a goner until Jon Arbuckle walked in the door.   On August 7, 1978 Lyman appeared on Jon's doorstep and said, "I'm cold. I'm hungry. I'm weak. Take me in!" And Jon let him stay, but Lyman had brought a dog. The dog's name was Odie. Then he disappeared on some unknown day and left Odie behind and he never came back.   On October 10, 1978 Garfield found Pooky.   On November 6, 1978 Garfield started having nap attacks.   On March 26, 1979 Garfield became the Caped Avenger who searches out evil wherever it may lurk... the late- morning evil that is.   On May 14, 1979 Garfield's stomach finally outgrew his legs.   On June 6, 1979 was the first appearance of Irma the waitress.   On June 26, 1979 was the first appearance of Liz the vet(Liz isn't short for Elizabeth, it's short for Lizard!).   On September 3, 1979 Garfield first met Nermal the world's cutest kitten. Garfield says "He's cute... and I hate 'cute'."   On March 30, 1980 was Garfield's first cat show...   I can say I am more like this gorgeous cat, oh well, aside from the fact that he is gorgeous like me, I also loved pasta, I do hate Mondays and I am sometimes lazy (but not him coz he is ALWAYS lazy). He loves to eat...a lot, I don't, not much. I weigh 5.6lbs when I entered this hypocrite world (darn! what a coincidence!)

      Here we are, the two of us together  Takin' this crazy chance to be all alone  We both know that we should not be together  'Cause if we're found out, it could mess up  Both our happy homes..  ann, maria, may, dobie and I are listenin' to the radio this morning then mr. joe played this on. I remembered a girl I once loved way back in college. she was a friend of petite, my bestfriend then. they were three in the group - petite, ellen and rhoda. petite was a year older taking up accountancy and I, psychology for that matter. I was in first year then and happened to have a room close to her so everytime we had a chance, we do chat and that was when I was introduced to ellen.   she's just the typical, simple girl you'll bump into school. she's quite taller than I am, chinita, fair-skinned, has a close resemblance to bianca lapuz.   I must admit that I had a crush on ellen the first time I laid my eyes on her. Unknowingly, she had a crush on me, too. Petite told her about my feelings for her but I didn't bother to ask her reacti. rhoda has a crush on her also. rhoda is the type of person that can get anything she wants, just like me. the only difference is that I get mine in a subtle way unlike her.   obviously they have more time together because they are classmates. rhoda tried so hard to get the attention of ellen. of course i know, petite was feeding me the info's. they became lovers. I got hurt when I've learned about it but as I've told my buddy, I can't do anything about it anymore. that's when I diverted my attention to a guy-a childhood sweetheart and close family of ours.   I was so focused with the guy when ellen called me one day and asked me if I still have feelings for her. I smirked and grinned. I asked her back,'why did you ask?why do you care?' besides I know that time, they were on for a month already so I didn't really bother to answer her seriously. actually, I just gave the phone back to petite. I don't really care. am i?   that was my fault. me ignoring that situation depressed her because she honestly admitted tha I was the one she really loves, not rhoda. it hurt her so much that she intended to get back at me and she was so confident that my relationship with jon would not last long. it did, she was right. we lasted for a month and a half. he was committed, too. damn! I always put myself in a situation wherein I know I'll end up as the loser.   she focused all the love to rhoda, supposedly for me. I ended up sulking on what happened. I was so devastated. I just realized that ellen was the one I love and not jon. but it was too late.   I tried to kill that feeling but I just simply can't she's always on my mind, I always see them in the campus. as if everywhere I go, her face was scattered all over the walls in the campus.   then one night, a voice on the other line was so familiar-ellen. she was cryin', blamin' me for what happened. I shouldn't have let her go, she said. we ended up cryin all night. I couldn't say a word. I still care for her and so does she. she asked me the same question, 'do you still love me?' immediately i said yes. oh well, I still love her okay. but I know it's not gonna be that easy. rhoda is still around and when she founds out, she won't take it that easy. she'll make my life so miserable. to make it short, we continued our so-called 'relationship.'   gail, my other bestfriend in college knew everything that's been happening even if I sometimes hide things from her like I will cut classes just to meet ellen and have lunch with her and because rhoda is not around. at times, I do feel like it's just a one-way thing but didn't care as long as I am with ellen.   all my friends doesn't approve of it. maybe because they really care about me. I know but I love ellen so much. but there was one incident that really tore me apart. nobody knew about this, not even gail-until now. I asked ellen out after our final exams and told her that we are going to a friend's house. it was our monthsary and I prepared dinner. she was supposed to come at 5pm, but I waited until 8pm. she didn't came. jenn called her up and was told that she went out with rhoda. she didn't bother to call me up or paged me her whereabouts. I might understand.   they just heard sobs after sobs all night. I couldn't talk. I didn't know what to say. all I know is that I was so hurt...really hurt.   ellen tried to explain though but never bothered to listen to her alibi's. months passed and haven't heard from them anymore. they were busy with their feasibility study. I was busy with mine, too...   one night, when all my garbled thoughts are scattered all over the ceiling, I asked myself, I mean I tried to convinced myself that I made the right decision and would not end up havin' regrets again. I told myself nobody can ever hurt me like that anymore, nobody. I was up all night thinkin. Did I make the right choice?   I guess I did. Yes I did...

      i love my baby. i love my baby. i love my baby.   Loving you is so easy. So many reasons exist why i love you. The little things you do, the simple gestures you make, even the thoughts that you share. Of course, I love the way you look and the way you feel. There are so many things to love about you! Do you know I love the way your eyes sparkle when you tell me a funny story? Do you know that I love the shape of your ears? Do you know I love to watch you sleep? I could go on and on... It's important to me that you know that i love you. So whatever it is that you are doing, thinking or saying, know that I am here, loving you.   I love you so much greenbear...

      i was so tired...i prepared all the necessary things for the meeeting the next day...had a fast dinner with my baby together with Mr. Ronald McDonald then an "indecent" one afterwards *wink* So physically stressed out that i really wanted to retire to bed early. I washed up then went straight to the lagoon. i was about to close my eyes and start to dream when the queen entered the lagoon...my mom.   MOM: hay antok na antok na ko ma'ga tayong matulog ha?  ME: ok. then kill the light.   she was praying...silence...zzzzzzzz   MOM: LRT na naman ako bukas. pagod na pagod na naman ako niyan. biruin mo 4 sets ng stairs ang inaakyat ko araw-araw?   yawn...   ME: huh. mommy, they only have 3.  MOM: hay naku wag kang makipagtalo sa kin dahil araw-araw akong umaakyat ng LRT.   since she woke up so i decided to open my mind to an "argument."   ME: wag kang makulit mommy 3 lang yun.as if naman di ako nag-lrt sa tanang buhay ko?! baka naman pati iyung platform eh binilang mo. some have 2 but definitely, they won't have 4.unless meron ganoong bagong gawa sa relihiyon nyo...   MOM: bahala ka.sge pag nanalo ka ako ang magbabayad ng passport mo.   uhhmm...lemme think...relihiyon - that's what i usually kid them when they tell things unusual to the human ears.   the next day, i still have an aftershock of the conversation. i did ask my friends ad colleagues about the conversation that transpired between me and mom. as expected i won.   di naman niya tinupad promise niya :( ganun iyun pag talo kunyari laging inis   hay....si mommy talaga bad trip sa earth.

      tagal ng walang akong post. na-miss ko pagsulat dito.   ano na nga ba ang nangyari sa mga nakalipas na araw? dami na. nung nakaraang weekend,may nakausap akong dating ka-ibigan--taz. tagal naming walang balita hanggang sa naisipan ko siyang tawagan para kamustahin.   tawanan, kulitan, at reminisce sa mga nangyari dati sa amin noon. masaya rin pala kahit pa'no. napag-alaman kong may nagmahal at minahal, may nasaktan at sinaktan...ako na lang ang nakakaalam kung nasaan ako doon. tutal itinuturing ko pa rin siya na minsang naging bahagi ng buhay ko. pero sa ngayon ang buhay ko ay si jay.   mahal ko si jay. mahal ko si jay. mahal ko si jay. mahal na mahal...   madalas kaming magkasama ngayon dahil kasama ko siyang namimili ng mga pan-regalo. masaya siyang kasama kasi palagi niya ako iniinis at kinukulit. sa totoo lang, kahit lagi niyang ginagawa iyun at lagi ko din siyang inaaway, mahal ko pa din siya. bakit? ewan. wala naman sigurong sagot sa tanong na iyon di ba? at kung meron man ako lang ang nakakaalam.   ---------------------------------------------------------   leyt ako (na naman!) grabe na ang trapik nakakainis na! di na talaga nakakatuwa. grrrr!!!!   pagdating ko, hinanap na kaming isa-isa ni jonathan. lagi naman eh. para bang lagi may roll-call. at nagsimula ng magtanong kung sino-sino ang papasok sa 26 at sa mga susunod pang mga araw bago matapos ang taon. may sumagot. nainis. malamang di nagustuhan ang narinig.   buti na lang at wala ako sa teybol ko dahil malamang magtatalo na naman kami. tama ba namang papasukin kami?   wala na ba kaming karapatang gamitin ang aming mga leave? sana pati iyun pinagkait na rin sa amin di ba?   hay naku.

      weekend was great but dead-tiring. went early to the bazaar with ann and jay followed after work. t'was fun lookin at stuff though not surprised anymore with some of them since i'm used to it--tiangges   while shoppin' we heard a voice over tellin that Santa Claus of Finland will be comin' over...   ME: sino daw?  ANN: Santa Claus daw dadating mamaya.  ME: talaga? san na?  ANN: di ka naman excited? mamaya pa daw.  ME: puntahan natin ha? gusto ko makita si SC.  ANN: para kang tanga! bata ka pa ha?!  ME: basta gusto ko makita.   maybe ann was thinkin that i was kiddin' when i was tellin her that i really wanted to see SC. i really did want to see him though i know for a fact that he was just another human bein dressed in a Claus' suit. oh well, i don't care.   fin'lly, i heard somebody said...'Santa's here!' grabbed ann's arm and headed the center where SC was. there..i saw him with great blue eyes (well just imagined coz i didn't really see him that near) with children taking pictures with him. honestly, i wanted to ask ann to go with me and have our picture taken with SC but i know she would shriek if i tell her that. knowin' ann. so just settled staring at the man with big tummy and white beard.   after several walks, decided to rest for awhile for some cuapao bacon. so, so yummy! ordered each for the three of us and after jay and i had our last bite, we immediately asked for another and shared it with each other. dunno if we're just too damned tired and hungry that we ate 2 or it's really that delicious. maybe it was the second cuz she bought a half kilo of the bacon as well as the cuapao bread to take it home.   an unimaginable traffic awaits us outside...cab fare at P300. whew! but t'was worth it. was able to buy gifts for everybody. almost. no need for worry though since i still have a week.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    my whole body aches when i woke up the next day. my feet still hurts. dropped by at my sugar's house later in the afternoon. watched t.v and did some cuddlin and lovin'...hey don't i deserved that after a long tiring and stressful week in the office? what? with all the pressures, c'mon give me a break.   when i went out of the room..felt REFRESHED already!   need i say more? *wink*

      yawn...i'm too lazy to work on this...dunno...i wanted to write something, oh well i have something in mind...the problem is that i'm tooooooooooo lazy.   owkei, owkei, i was able to watch 2 DVD movies the other night. first, i was able to watch 2fast-2 furious (so delayed since i bought this months ago). fabulous cars, i tell you! awesome! i can't think of a good adjective that will apply to my satisfaction...ever since, i've been an ardent lover of cars. and paul walker is so cute! if i can still remember, an aunt from Australia gave me a police car, when it bumps to something, it will automatically go back. i was wonderin' why she gave me that-it's for boys, right? oh well, she told mom that she thought i was a boy....hahaha!! i am(right now!) lol! so much into such non-sense.   after that, i got hold of notting hill. i love julia roberts! well who does? i love pretty woman the most. i love the part when they were saying goodbye and julia was telling richard gere about the knight who will come and save her from the wicked witch...hopeless romantic that i am!   She who always seems so happy in a crowd  Whose eyes can be so crowded and so proud  No one's allowed to see them when they cry  She may be the love that cannot hope to last  May come to me from shadows of the past  But I'll remember till the day I die   She may be the reason I survive  The why and wherefore I'm alive  The one I'll care for through the rough in many years  Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears  And make them all my souvenirs  For where she goes I've got to be  The meaning of my life is she...   can't you see, i'm talkin' nonsense here..told ya i am lazy. not that i have a pea-sized intellect, mind's too blown to think...

      i'm bored-absolutely stiff!!!   i hate bein' bored. it seems like every minute that passes by is bein' totally wasted. i had to do something to break this monotony. i've got to do something or i'll go crazy.   i wanted to leave this work. not that i'm not happy with what i am doing. oh well, probably i am already. i want something new. i have to leave or else id be doomed in here forever. though i hate to leave my friends in here but i can't go on like this forever - low salary, not so good boss, no growth.   i hate what i am feeling right now. i do feel really down, so low.

       it's not about what happened in the past, not about what you think might happen in the future, it's about the ride. if you're not gonna enjoy the ride, when you least expect it, something GREAT might come along, something BETTER than what you ever plan for...  (fr ALONG CAME POLLY)  you know it's not easy for me to do something that definitely needs a lot of thinkin. yes, today is my second day of bein jobless and i'm HAPPY. i took the risk of jumping out of the office not because i had a fight with one of my colleagues but it's just that when 2004 came, i realized that it's leading me nowhere. i'm turnin 26 next week and if somebody would dare ask me if i am stable, i'd definitely say NO (dat is if im still in the company)   i miss my friends? that's a BIG YES but i don't wanna come back.  di sa mataas pride ko  but i'll end up as the loser if i'd do that. i like what i did. and i am happy also.  oh, whatever.

      Tuesday was my last day in the office…yeah, I resigned already but you know the only thing that saddens me is that I left all of my friends in there. Aside from that? Nah…   Well, ano bang mami-miss ko sa office ko? Isa-isahin ko ang mga taong naging kasa-kasama ko for almost 4 years…tagal noh?  Si…  EDWIN – yung pagka-jologs niya siyempre. Yung sobrang bait nya (o walang malisya ha?) bilib lang talaga ako sa iyo when it comes to handling your family, friends, work, nasira ka lang talaga sa babae…hay sana nga makahanap ka na ng para sa iyo. Wag ka na din magsusugal kasi wlang dudulot na maganda sa iyo yun. Punta ka pa din sa min pag may occasion ha? Welcome pa rin naman kayong lahat sa min noh? Tsaka pwede ba namang makalimutan ang gorgeous ‘lips’ mo? Joke lang. Naalala ko lang si yam pag ginagaya ka niya..hehehe  KAREN –  ikaw pa? Parang ate na talaga ang turing ko sa iyo. Naging part ka na din ng family naming kaya sana every now and then you’ll text mommy and me pa rin ha? Tsaka siyempre hindi ko kakalimutan pagiging ninang kay wacky boy at tita kina darla at jakee. Times na nakinig ka sa mga sentiments ko, sa mga plans ko…thank you.  JOANAH- di ko na makikita ang mga bago mong shoes, bags at damit mo, yung walang kamatayang mga boylette’s mo (namatay na yung iba dahil di na nagparamdam) hehehe. Wait ka lang talaga sister, there’s someone for you hindi pa lang nagtatagpo ang landas niyo. But you have to meet him halfway kaya lumabas-labas ka din at please lang wag na masyadong mapili ok? Di ko naman sinasabi na kahit sino na lang, but give THEM  a chance at wag mo kaagad close doors mo. Ikaw masyado mong minamata at niloloko  si PIKA baka sya ang makatuluuan mo. Ano nga kaya noh? Uy, you can never tell sister. Siyempre makakalimutan ko ba naman ang mga ‘pintas’ at mga ‘codes’ mo kung kani-kanino. Ako nga tinatawag mong NEGRA pero okay lang sanay na ko…hehehe. Yung panga-away at paghihigpit mo kay majoy at pagsigaw mo sa ate mo. Thanks sa pagiging listener ko pag may problema ko though di naman ako madalas magsabi sa iyo. Still, thanks pa din.   YAM- female counterpart ni Edwin for bein jologs.hehehe. makakalimutan ba ang taong marunong kumain ng L _ N _ I _ (fill in the blanks na lang kasi alam nating lahat ang sagot) ang frustrated radio announcer con dj (mahal kayo, mahal kayo ni may zabala….) lam mo natatawa pa din ako pag naaalala ko yung kwento mo na yon sa min sa starex. Yng paglilinis mo ng mukha mo everyday as well ang paglilinis ng tenga mo na halos maalis na ata. Ang babaeng sipunin….palagi na lang may allergy at nagpupunta sa derma. Ang matipid sa ulam at malakas sa kanin, mahilig kumain ng isda at gulay. Lam mo sister sana namana ko yan sa iyo kasi how I wish mahilig din ako sa gulay. Ang babaeng maliit pero ang ha-haba ng paa at darili. Hay naku sister dami ko mami-miss sa iyo…you never fail to make me laugh…always.   DINDI- ang babaeng galit ata sa pera. Josko kahit di naman masyadong kailangan bili kaagad. Pag ginusto bili agad. Di mo man masyadong napapakita dindz sweet ka naman eh. Kahit na minsan sablay ka sa mga sagot mo tanggap ko na ganun talaga ang character mo. Tsaka di ko na kailangan pang isa-isahin ang mga di ko makakalimutan sa iyo lam mo na iyun. Basta kahit anong mangyari at nangyari I’ll prove to you that I am one of your GOOD FRIENDS. Kahit di mo masyadong pinapakita alam kong you care kaya na-appreciate ko yun. Joke lang. Basta ingat ka dindz  ok? Pano yan la ka na partner sa branch visits at comp. shop? Di bale isipin mo na lang na kasama mo pa din ako. Text mo lang ako or call me pag may kailangan ka   CEL-kahit na sandali lang kita nakasama I saw a friend in you. You’ve been a constant listener ng magkatabi tayo. We share setiments. Ikaw tungkol sa asawa’t anak mo. Ako sa family ko din at kay J. Miss ko na nga pagsasabay natin ng pag-uwi. Simula kasi ng na-manyak ka ibang route mo na eh.

RONALD-kahit di kita masyadong naging close, I treat you din naman na friend kaya if you need me text me lang. Di ko makakalimutan? Siguro yung pinakanta ka ni Edwin sa conference room ng KAILANGAN KITA. Natalo mo pa kami ni yam ah. Soprano din kami pero mas mataas pa ata naging boses mo sa min that time. Hahaha! Joke lang po. Pakabait ka at wag kung sino-sino kinakaibigan mo. Wag kang masyadong maging mabait.    Ano pa ba? Ang canteen natin na paulit-ulit ang pagkain…Ang ‘sister’ ko na matagal kong hinanap ditto ko lang pala matatagpuan sa HW. Hehehe…Si JAY na gf-bf ni yammidudz. Si ABBY na mukhang gusgusin at feeling close sa mga kumakain dun. If I know gusto lang niya may mahiraman ng damit. Joke3… Si MR.BEAN na guard sa P1, na anlaking sumubo ng saging. Si DARAG..Si Goliath…Si LEA…Si SANTA CLAUS…Yung ibang buyers sa KABILA na may sari-sariling kwento…SSSSHHHH….Si ASTROBOY na palaging ginagaya ni yam…Ang mga kwento ng mga magbf-gf sa HW…  Ang ‘team-building’ natin sa batangas…sa star city…andami pa noh?

      jay and i watched the heart 2 heart concert of patti austin and james ingram last saturday. i was so thrilled..as in!   i also received a garfield stuff toy from jay also. the concert ticket was a surprise. i wasn't expecting it actually though i really wanted to see those fave artists of mine. i remember that i used to listen to those songs over n over when i was still a lil girl. mom loved it also cuz she loves listenin to patti.  at first i got irritated cuz it started late but when i saw n heard patti, geessshhh, i did realize jay was with me...lol!  oh well she understood since she knew how i loved these two fellahs.  i was singing all night with them.  i was also enthralled by the beautiful fireworks displayed-not in the concert but it was at westin' hotel. if only gorgeous patti knew that the audience at that time were clapping n shoutin on the display of fireworks and not on her singin. hahahaha!  t'was kinda chilly, forgot my jacket...but that's okay since i have my humna blanket beside me.  "under the brightest of stars, and in between beautiful music are  firworks, sittin ryt besyd someone you love is the best way to celebrate heart's day"  that's for my sugar-jay. i love you!

      when you love someone, do you really give everything without expectin anythin in return? well, that's what i do. i don't know with the others.   is it right to take it against your previous partner when your relationship didn't work? i guess not.  but why are there people who's so  BITTER  that they tend to bring the past in their present lives? oh yes, you can but deal with it with kindness and not bringing another hurt to your past relationship.  that person i'm talkin about is so  WEIRD . i mean after all those years, the anger should have subsided already but i was wrong. her heart's full of anger til now. i can't understand her. i never did actually understand the person-- DOB !!!   that's why i never had regrets letting go of you...bitch!!!  i just hope and pray that JB is not like that. i mean, i've learned my lessons well. i don't want that to happen between us. we should remember that we love and have loved each other, and most importantly, we are friends so i guess we shouldn't be doin that kind of stuff to ourselves--just in case we separate ways.  but knowin JB, she's a person with  BREEDING  so i'm not that scared.

      denver graduated last monday--PICC Plenary Hall. it started as scheduled (good thing cuz i hate waiting for so long)  kuya roger dropped us off (me, denver and mom), the whole family will just follow at around 6pm to eat at chinatown's best foods in banawe. we often go there when there are special occasions. food's sp great especially the crabs, peking duck and roast beef--so tender.  as much as i wanted to listen intently to the speakers on the grad rite, i couldn't help myself from makin this-- tsk tsk  cuz they're not good. not that I'M BETTER but i guess they weren't able to prepare so much on those speech. and i hate it. one thing that i do during occasions like those is to listen to speeches, good ones not like those. it really sucks.  when the speaker introduced the faculty of UST, i saw one familiar person-- P___N . uhmmm...wonder who's this? well, she was a SOCIO teacher if i'm not mistaken and this woman became a 'significant other' of one of my ex's. this ex often drops off our place to visit me and to ask favors like this--visiting the other significant other.  hehehe. but t'was okay.  i mean it's fun bein with her.  tatakas lang ako  cuz mom would't allow me to go out already since it's 8pm na. we will go to qc near st. theresa's college--place where she leaves.  i felt awkward at that time since  di ako naka-porma , i'm shy.  wala lang tapos alis din kami agad . they call each other BABES, that's their terms of endearment. sweet noh? but not long enough since my ex found out that the cousin whom Babes introduced to us in our first visit was the  REAL GF ..sakit di ba? kapal talaga na i-deny siya...hay naku so much for that... BAD SIYA !!!  i saw the other members of the faculty, some wearing some silly hats (dunno what's that for), i even joked about it and told mom that ALFIE LORENZO is around.  where?   i pinpointed the man with the orange hat...hahaha!!! we both laughed at my silly remark. then there's dulce and danny cruz. their child is a classmate of my bro.   MOM : akala ko ba hiwalay na sila?  ME :(whisperin to myself-hay naku here's ms. nosy again) ewan ko. lapitan mo then tanungin mo ng malaman mo.   aray...pinalo ako sa braso.  pikon din si mommy (gaya ko)   ME :eh siguro request ng anak dahil graduation niya.   MOM :siguro nga.  as expected mom cried while they were calling my brother's name. okay, okay, i did too. but those were of course tears of joy.  graduate na kami lahat.  i was also proud.  ------------------------------------------------------- when i woke up the next morning, i saw a guess paperbag near the computer and saw a note from maricar-- congratulations! sorry for my shortcomings! PEACE?! i love you.  that was nice. i mean they were not in speaking terms for almost a year, i guess this is the right time to settle their dispute. besides, we're not gettin any younger. i texted denver and told him that i'm glad to hear that they're A-OK.  sus tapos na yun

      i don't like this to happen but i have to.  i'm sorry. i told myself that i'm not going to apologize because it'll not sound sincere.  i'm wrong.  saying sorry is an understatement.  if i only knew that things would get out of hand, i never would have initiated everything.  but then, we both know that these 'if only's' are already futile.  what's done is done.  many people support the importance of communication.  they say that it is easier to achieve some kind of an understanding if people communicate through words.  they are right, i guess.  however, and i don't mean to sound negative,  SILENCE , sometimes is more effective than words.  silence heals what the words have wounded.  it gives space to think or plan the next move, or to arrive at a decision.  it announces victory and fakes defeat.  moreover, it'll never work on the impatient, because its meaning remains a mystery to people who are insensitive and undiscerning-while words explain in clear terms a feeling, an idea, an opinion; silence may prelude it. it speaks volumes before a single utterance is made.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  some people has a lot of TOOTHACHES.  they keep on looking for the best dentist.  they doesn't realize that they can cure it all by themselves.  the thing is, they gotten used to treating every pain instantly, never knowing that in doing so, they're bringing more into it.

CHESKA : nasan ka na ba? 30mins. na ako naghihintay dito sa coffee shop!   ME:  oo na malapit na ko, ma-traffic lang kasi. may inutos pa kasi ang mommy sa kin. sori na. padating na ako.  etong kaibigan ko kapag siya ang late OKAY lang kasi...wala basta okay lang. pero kapag ako ang na-late sa meeting place namin, hay naku katakot-takot na sermon ang maririnig ko.  2:00pm na. nasa tapat na ako coffee shop kung san ko mi-meet si cheska.   CHESKA : hay salamat naman at dumating na rin. gutom na ko sa totoo lang.  ME : eto naman pasensya ka na. have pasalubong for you. sige na smile ka na. o anong problema mo?  as usual iniyakan na naman ako dahil niloko na naman daw siya ng   gf   niya. manloloko daw. hay naku ang kulit kasi sinabi ng hiwalayan na niya iyun dahil bad influence naman sa kanya si jem. oo, tama kayo isa siyang lesbyana. at siya ang bestfriend ko.  naka-1 year din daw sila ni jem. pero sa isang taon na iyun madalas daw anf awayan at bangayan nila. ilang beses na din ba silang naghiwalay? ewan ko. i lost track already. dahil sa akin palaging umiiyak etong si chest 'pag may problema lalo na sa lovelife.   ME : hayaan mo na, dami naman jan eh. tumingin ka lang sa paligid mo. tahan na nakaka-TO ka. nawawala ang pagka-macho mo.  CHESKA : gago!   di hamak na mas maganda si cheska sa kin, huwag mo nga lang paglalakarin dahil mahahalata. hahaha. mas marami siyang manliligaw sa akin pero siyempre 'di niya pinapansin dahil mas gusto niya ang babae.  nagaya siya sa bahay nila. mag-inuman daw kami. o siya sige pagbigyan, may problema eh. pero sa totoo lang di naman ako palainom. isang bote nga lang tipsy na ako. hindi ko rin natutunan ang manigarilyo dahil may hika ako.  ME: pssst tama na yan lasing ka na. may pasok pa bukas. CHESKA : *%@# kasi. bakit ba ganun BEST sobra ko namang minahal si jem bakit niya ko iniwan? nung unang nakipaghiwalay siya sabi niya sa kin humanap na lang daw ako ng deserving of my love kaya nga naging kami ni maeshell di ba? kaya lang bigla naman niya akong tinawagan tapos sabi niya mas mahal daw niya ako kaysa sa ewan ko kung anong pangalan ng pinalit niya sa kin. eh pucha mas mahal ko siya kesa kay mae kaya binalikan ko. ilang beses na niyang ginagawa sa kin yun. nagmumukhang gago't tanga ako...  sa loob-loob ko tanga ka nga kasi pumapayag kang magpa-gago kay jem. pero sabi nga nila pag nagmamahal ka tanga ka.  12:30 a.m.   lumalalim na ang gabi. lasing na lasing na si cheska. pinilit ko siyang dalhin sa kuwarto niya para makatulog na. grabe ang bigat! pero pinilit ko pa din ng mapunasan dahil kadiri amoy suka. habang nasa baba kasi kami at umiinom, nag-blow na sa sobrang dami ng nainom ang gaga. pinalitan ko na ng pajama. anlikot, tapos parang nagdidiliryo na. tinatawag ang pangalan ni jem nang bigla akong napahiga papunta sa kanya.   ayyy. biglang nagtama ang mga paningin namin. bigla niya akong niyakap at hinalikan. masarap siyang humalik.  gentle  kumbaga. unti-unti niyang hinubad ang blouse at bra ko. at pagkatapos ang pants. pumatong siya sa 'kin...  hindi ko na maalala pa ang mga sumunod na nangyari. pero sa totoo lang napaiyak na lang ako. marahil magkahalong saya at lungkot ang naramdaman ko. malungkot dahil alam kong hindi niya talagang ginusto ang nangyari at habang ako ang katabi niya eh ibang pangalan ang sinasabi niya. masaya dahil sa kabila ng lahat, MAHAL ko pa din siya. oo matagal na hindi ko lang masabi dahil ayokong lumayo siya sa kin.  kaya kung sinasabi niyang tanga siya at minahal niya si jem sa kabila ng lahat, mas TANGA ako dahil sa kabila ng lahat minamahal ko pa din siya.

          lapit na graduation ni bunso--denver, sa march 29 na.  i know my bro is excited about this. just like me before. he just finished his defense last week (got  uno  for a score-wow!) well, he deserves it u know? he haven't got enough sleep since he started making his thesis.   MOM : anong oras ka na naman natulog?  DENVER : late na. dami ko pa kasi tatapusin eh.  MOM : matulog ka naman. how can you get your energy if you're not gonna sleep di ba?  DENVER : oo na  hay si mommy talaga...always concern...favorite niya kasi si denver. being the bunso he's always been pampered by mommy. i never got jealous kasi i know that she loves us all. even daddy i know (wherever he is) he loved us all. although syempre there will always be favorites di ba? i know i am a favorite also *wink*  i smiled when i heard their conversation. i remembered my school days. how i would complain with all the demands of being a student especially when i was bombarded with reviewers that i didn't even want to glance at, because it's too long, or simply because i'm fed up and resist the idea of being forced to do things like reviewing, even if i'm not up to it.  but then, i didn't have a choice. most students dont. we have to do it, or risk flunking the subjects.   bad trip nga talaga di ba lalo na pag mag group works pero ikaw lang ang nagta-trabaho ng project . but these tests help you prepare for a much more difficult exams you are bound to face in life.  you know, thinking back i would much rather undergo a battery of test in Physics and Religion or a 5-chapter History test than be given a single test in life.   kasi doon wala naman reviewer di ba? hindi mo alam jung anong scope, kung anong libro ang magiging reference mo, or kung objective or essay-type of test ba siya .    "Today, we face as a class; tomorrow, we'll face you as individuals, who learned the value of determination, perseverance, love and friendship, and though we know that we might not end up together, we'll be fine, because nothing and no one can take that away from us."    --stated by ANDREA OF BEVERLY HILLS 90210.  good luck bro. we love you, do keep that in mind. and as your ate...THAT'S AN ORDER!!!

      last friday was my special day...yeah t'was my birthday...thank you to those who remembered ( pati na rin sa mga maysakit na 'kalimot' )  i wasn't that excited about my birthday (syempre i'll be a year older-lol) though jay insisted that i should be excited about it...maybe because of the present she's about to give me...well, it really is SOMETHING- a FOSSIL watch (another addition to my collection-yipee!) we both have that kind of model- para daw partner kami.   my sister carmz gave me SEASON's 1 & 2 of  SEX n d CITY . i've watched the whole season already on cable and the fifth season on tapes; tee-shirts, bag, money from mom...  jay and i went to TAGAYTAY last weekend. her sister-in-law cooked for me and gave me a choc'lit cake. i brought sugpo from mom. yummy. i had a good rest and had some quality time with jay.  tagal ko na rin siya di katabi matulog.   sa summer na siguro ang kasunod    -------------------------------------------------------------  awhile ago, while i was talkin to jay, i mentioned that a 'friend' texted me a forwarded message last night somethin like this: 'burahin na lang kaya kita sa phonebook ko...kasi nandito ka naman sa puso ko'. i wasn't expectin a text from her. i replied though--'it's better that you erased me in ur phonebook wala din namang silbi are u  too busy in school or don't u have a calendar at home that u forgot the date last friday?' she texted me again sayin there'll be no excuses for what she did and she will understand if ever i won't speak to her again. she was sick the whole week. SO? not that i really don't care. she did it twice. i mean, i thought this time she'll make it up with me. we're not really in speaking terms these days. i don't know.  basta naiinis ako sa kanya.   goin' back to jay and me, i told her that i was thinkin last night--may bestfriend pa ba ko? wala na yata. before, i consider some but as i get older, i realize that i should set a new standard for a 'bestfriend' you see, you'll say that this person is your bestfriend if she/he knows EVERYTHING, almost EVERYTHING 'bout you. you can tell her/him anythin without editin anythin and that you can rely on this person anytime of the day....i guess it's really hard to find one these days. but come to think of it, i told myself i have one (aside from the MAN above)--strong>KIS . i can tell her everything. that's one good thing about us, we're not just partners, we're  BESTFRIENDS, GOOD FRIENDS . that's why i love this girl. and i thank HIM for giving me someone like her...

        hey it's a shooting star...       i saw one last weekend on my way home. i don't usually look at the sky especially when you are crossing a street but there's this feeling that there's something up there, and so there it was--the shooting star.  how i wish i was in the province, with my blanket on a hill with the clear sky... damn feels so good.

       y lie?   i don't really understand why this friend of ours has to lie almost about everything? i mean she can really be a pest sometimes, you don't know what's runnin in her head. she's so quiet but she has a lot to say when it comes to writing.  okay, in fairness to her, there are things that i've heard are so true but a reliable source told a friend that ' may sayad nga siya. ' she's nice naman pero di ko talaga ma-take minsan ang 'pag-iinarte' niya at 'pagpapa-cute' dahil awkward tignan...  hay, what the heck. but the sprite commercial reminds me of the famous' "MAGPAKATOTOO KA!"

        korina, korina....        if you can just see me today, you can see the glow in my eyes and would probably just give u the cutest smile i can share with anybody today.  why?  ask the lady on the picture.  yeah, that's korina sanchez--"media's bad girl" as they say but for me, she's not. as far as i'm concerned she is one of the true persons i know (not that i know her personally but the way i look at her and watch on t.v, she is one)  i dreamt of her last night. wasn't thinking of her but lately i have this 'kilig' feeling everytime i watch her on their morning show- morning girls  with my other fav'rite woman in the 'biz, kris aquino. i've always been attracted to people with strong personality especially women. anyways, here's the dream all about. she dropped by at our house daw and played badminton with another ex of mine (never mind the ex, im focused on my girl). i cooked lunch for her and she even slept overnight at our place. then she went home the next day.  then, i called her up to check on her. ohhh, i can still recall the sweet voice on the other line saying, " bakit mo ko tinawagan, na-miss mo ko agad?"  then i said,  "tatawagan ba kita kung hindi kita na-miss agad?"   then....shit! i was awaken by the sound of those electionists at our place.   kainis!    but it's okay the dream is still fresh...i can still see her pretty face and still hear her sweet voice everytime i keep quiet.  oh, i love korina. one of these days, i'll make a poem or write her a letter or would probably send something for her.  how i wish she can read this one...haaaayyyy.

        passion of the christ...     ' The Passion of The Christ ' is a film about the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. It opens in the Garden of Olives (Gethsemane) where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Jesus resists Satan's tempations. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is arrested and taken back to within the city walls of Jerusalem where the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death.    i watched this film together with the family last friday (good friday) on our home theater with iced tea and chips on the side.  hehehe. we can't watch without some goodies on our hands. we were all quiet, even my nine-year old cousin was so focused on the movie, which is somewhat unusual for her.  the movie's great, but i can't watch it again. the suffering's too much for me to handle, i was teary-eyed when the movie concluded. we were all teary-eyed mind you. i can't take it anymore, i mean to watch it all over again? no way, man. if i were on that scene of the movie that the romans were scourging HIM to death, i would have stand on where i am standing anf would have shouted this, "ENOUGH!" i felt the pain and agony. i can't even stare at the wounds and bloody body of Jesus.   but if you weren't able to watch it, man, you're missing something good, you better.

        kailan darating ang TRU LUV KO?    was watchin morning girls this morning and this was their topic. told myself when i first read the title, "baduy naman.."  before they start, the 2 intellectual ladies usually chat about the topic and how they view about it. as always and as expected, kris was teasin' korina about  mr. palengke (running senatoriable mar roxas) that he was her true love...blah blah blah.  korina said that she treated all her boyfriends as her TRUE LOVE'S and even imagined each one of them as her groom-to-be. whew! that was me! now, i have to put the phone down and listen intently to the show. i think i can relate to her. i mean, i mam a very hopeless romantic lady eversince. i can say that all my relationships in the past have been treated with all the emotions and care that they needed from me (not unless very BITTER to admit-huh!!!) and have shown them what is really due for them.    ako ba nahanap ko na true love ko?  i dunno really. i hope. years back, i imagined myself that i've already found the one (sorry baby but it was a HIM-told you 'bout this already though) he was certainly my type and have devoted my unending love.  but unfortunately, it didn't work out. he said, he cannot handle an LDR, i agree. i don't want the same thing for us so we decided to just let go and just remain friends. i tried contacting him through SMS and even through postal mail but he didn't reply back in all those efforts of mine. not that i do have feelings for him still, i just wanted to know how he was doin' that's all. he was a  FRIEND  and i still consider 'til now. i tried lookin for him at FRIENDSTER but to no avail.   but right now, i have JB with me and she doesn't have to worry since she has me, and i have her. i love you...do remember that okay?

        for our anniversary...08         MY ALL  by nelly   From first sight, I knew me and you were right. By just once glance, My mind, body, & heart were put into a trance. I knew that in that second I was making that fall, I was giving you my all.  Its something about you, There's nothing I wouldn't do For you. I want to be the reason you smile, I want to hold you for a while, And hear all your pain, All I know is that our love is driving me insane. I just want to give you my all, I don't mind taking this fall.  I know in my heart, That you and me will never part. We are meant to be, So I know you will catch me. So I'm taking this fall, I'm giving you my all!!!!   ** a year has passed and have surpassed the turmoils.  thank God! you know what, there's one thing that i've realized since i had a lot of time these past few days. i cannot give up on something or someone that can make me happy. inspite and despite of, they can never give me the happiness ONLY YOU can give me.   the happiness and fulfillment that my family is giving me is not enough, i need you still. and if time really comes that we have to part ways, you'll have my assurance that the FRIENDSHIP that we have shared will remain. it's not that easy to build something that we have established. yes, i've made friends with the others but not the thing that we have and im blessed.  there maybe times that we cannot understand each other, may have disappoint each other but AGAIN,  LOVE TRANSCENDS EVERYTHING  (i love usin' this word). it's true, isn't it? no matter what i do or think, it always comes back to one thing---you.    happy 2nd year anniversary, baby...

        welcome home, buddy!        my college buddy, abbsz will be arrivin tonight via Northwest Airline *wink* she makes sure that she goes home every year.   abbsz is my bestfriend way back in college. we used to have the same sked so we really hang out a lot. i kinda felt sad when she told me that she'll be leaving for new jersey two weeks after graduation. we do have plans of applyin in the same company so we can still be together. i must admit my college life will not be complete without telling something about her. she was the other half of me...ooops, you shouldn't put any malice on this cuz archie's her partner for almost 8 years already. archie's 3 years our senior. we go to the same school.  i was lookin for somethin in my cabinet then i saw some of the letters we shared then. i love making letters and simple notes for friends then. i got hold of one note she gave me. that made me smile.  i miss those times .  and i miss the person. i miss my bestfriend . i can say that we don't usually communicate that much right now. dunno why. maybe becuz we have more priorities than before. we used to talk a lot, page each other almost everyday, exchange notes, etc. but it's quite different now. but i believe that time and people cannot change the bond that we made. it's gonna stay forever that way.  you see, i love my friends especially those who are  WORTHY OF MY TRUST AND CARE , and i make sure that they can always get the best of me.   i just hope that by the time she reads this, there'll be a difference. i wanted to bring back those times, abbsz that you see me as a part of your life and that you're still countin on me in anyway possible. it's not that easy since i know you have a lot of friends around you and that you may unconsciously put me aside. not that i'm bein kinda sentimental (oh well i guess i do)  enough of this mushiness, i just wanna let you know that you are still my bestfriend...FRIENDS FOREVER. LOVE YOU!

        Kasi...      **o baka may mag-react na naman dito na di naman dapat. kung nagkataon ang nangyari sa inyo, manahimik na lamang dahil wala akong kinalaman basta eto ISTORYA LAMANG!!    *****  Una silang nagkita ni Gerard sa opisinang pinapasukan ko. Pinakilala siya sa buong 'department' ng isang staff sa amin. Ganun naman palagi nililibot ang mga bagong empleyado sa opisina para makilala ng lahat at malaman ng lahat na may bago pala kaming ka-opisina. Ganun din ang ginawa nila ng bago pa lang ako. Nagkatuksuhan na nga agad dahil may kamukha daw akong gf ng isang kasamahan namin.  *****  Hindi naman sila nagkakausap ni Gerard dahil malayo siya sa amin, ngayon lang dahil sinabayan nila kami ni Trish, naka-bakasyon na kasi ang iba. Magma-mahal na araw na kasi. Ayokong mag-leave dahil wala namang gagawin sa bahay at gusto kong tapusin ang trabaho ko. Tahimik lang siya bihirang magsalita at ngumiti. Biniro ko pa nga dahil sabi ko baka mapanisan siya ng laway. Ngumiti siya. Ngayon ko lang nakita ang ngiti na iyon sa kanya, ganda pala ng ngipin niya. Nagkuwentuhan lang sandali tapos nagpaalam na rin kami dahil wala rin naman ako sa mood makipagkuwentuhan ng mga panahon na iyon.  *****  Naging tampulan na sila ng tuksuhan noon dahil 'crush' daw niya ang bestfriend ko nung una pa lang daw niya itong makita. Hindi naman pinaniwalaan ng kaibigan ko dahil alam naming may gf na siya at nabalitaan ko ring malapit na silang ikasal. Nalaman ko lang kay Trish  na madalas na mag-text si Gerard sa kanya pero di naman niya ito pinapansin. Pero nung minsang magpunta sa 'department' namin si Gerard nahuli kong napatingin ito sa kanya, napangiti naman ang landi kong kaibigan. Alam ko ang mga ngiting iyon. Iyun bang ngiti na parang may kilig. Hinihintay ko siyang magsalita sa kin tungkol doon pero lumipas ang isang linggo na wala siyang kinukuwento sa akin. Sabi ko na lang sa sarili ko baka masaya lang siya talaga nung araw na iyon. Hindi kasi sila magkaaway ng girlfriend niya. Oo may gf  si Trish magi-isang taon na rin sila sa susunod na buwan. Natatandaan ko pa ako ang una niyang tinawagan ng maging sila ni Karla. Gustong-gusto niya si Karla mabait daw kasi at malambing.  *****  Kagabi hindi ko inaasahan ang tawag ni Trishia, leyt na din kasi. May sasabihin daw kasi siya sa akin. Kahit inaantok pa ako pinakinggan ko ang mga sinabi niya. Sabi ko na nga ba, hindi si Karla ang dahilan ng mga ngiti noon sa opisina kung hindi si ang lalaking nasa kabilang department lang. Para daw love at first sight. Bigla daw niyang naramdaman na parang gusto niya si Gerard ng mga sandaling iyon. Parang bigla daw huminto ang pag-ikot ng mundo.  Para bang may spark. Sabi ko nga sa kanya ang korni niya eh. Pero kung tutuusin hindi naman talaga kakornihan iyon dahil naramdaman ko na rin naman iyon noon kaya naiintindihan ko siya. Huwag ko daw sasabihin kay Karla at paniguradong magseselos iyon. Bakit ko naman sasabihin eh di nagalit naman iyun sa kin sabihin kinukunsinti ko pa si Trishia. Ayoko ngang madamay. Pero alam ko kasing iyon ang mga tipo niyang lalaki eh. Pihikan ang kaibigan kong iyon. Bihira mong mapapatibok ang puso noon lalo na pagdating sa lalaki. Kaya nung sinabi niya sa aking unti-unting nahuhulog ang loob niya kay Gerard eh hindi na ko nagtaka. Sa tingin ko hindi naman mahirap mahalin si Gerard, sabi nga nila siya ang tipong magiging 'ideal man' ng lahat.  Kaya lang sabi ko kay Trishia hindi pwedeng maging sila dahil pareho silang committed unless mamimili siya.  Naku patay tayo diyan!  *****  Hindi naman daw siya umaasa na magiging sila dahil mahal niya si Karla at hindi niya ito kayang iwan, kahit alam niyang napapamahal na siya sa ka-opisina namin. Maaaring hindi maintindihan si Gerard ng ibang tao pero nakita’t naramdaman ko ang sinseridad niya sa kaibigan ko ng kinausap ko siya tungkol sa kanilang dalawa. Marami kasing nagtatanong noon sa akin kung sila ba ni Trish dahil napapadalas ang text at daan ni Mark sa amin at at paminsan-minsan nga tumatawag pa sa lokal. Hindi naman totoo, basta alam ko. Pero ang totoo mas mahal ni Gerard si Trishia kaysa sa magiging asawa niya. Nauna nga lang daw kasing dumating si Natasha sa buhay niya sana daw ang kaibigan ko ang pakakasalan niya. Sa pagkakaalam ko nagusap sila ni Trishia noon bago siya magpakasal. Nagkaroon pa nga sila ng kasunduan na hindi muna magpapakasal si Trishia at hihintayin daw si Gerard.  Tama ba iyon? Um-oo lang siya noon kahit alam niyang wala naman na talaga siyang hihintayin na Gerard pagdating ng panahon.    *****  Matagal ding wala silang communication na dalawa pero sa huling kuwentuhan namin tinawagan pa siya ni Gerard nung araw ng kasal niya. Hindi umiyak si Trishia noon pero alam kong bumigat ang loob niya kahit paano sa pagpapakasal ni Gerard kay Natasha. Hindi naman daw niya kasi kailangang magpakasal kung talagang mas mahal siya nito. Magulo ang utak ng kaibigan ko noon dahil iniisip niya kung anong mangyayari kung sakaling iniwan nga ni Gerard ang asawa niya. Siyempre kailangan niyang mamili. May Karla siya di ba? Pero hindi alam ni lalaki ang tungkol kay Karla at hindi rin alam ni Karla ang tungkol kay Gerard. Alam kong magiging masakit kay Jen kung sakaling iiwan niya si Karla dahil matagal na rin naman ang pinagsamahan nilang dalawa kahit alam kong lihim na pag-ibig lang ang sa kanila, nalalaman kong totoo sila sa kanilang nararamdaman. Nalalaman din ni Trishia na mas tama ang magiging relasyon niya kay Gerard pero walang kasiguraduhan dahil maaaring hindi naman ganun kalalim ang nararamdaman niya dito. Pero kilala ko ang kaibigan ko, minahal niyang talaga si Gerard…sa maling panahon nga lang. Tukso ko nga sa kanila dapat ang theme song nila  'SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD' ni  Barry Manilow.    *****  Trishia’s over with Gerard alam ko iyon. Wrong timing nga lang  ang sabi ko kay Trishia sa nangyari sa kanila. Dahil everytime na may lalaki siyang nagugustuhan saka naman hindi pwede. Hay…sana lang maging masaya silang dalawa sa mga naging desisyon nila. Mahal ko ang kaibigan ko at ayokong nasasaktan siya.    Kasi mahal ko din siya eh…

      kis and i talked several times this week about the problem. i know she means well and she's really sorry for what she's done but i still can't help it...kept thinkin of what happened.  everytime i close my eyes at night, it keeps comin back...can't help myself from cryin everytime. though i'm tryin to forget about it.  we're quite okay but i still don't want to hear any promises...i don't like it anymore...it hurts me more...  i just hope this time kis will be more cautious and sensitive cuz i don't know if there will be a   CHANCE   again.

         just played badminton with high school friends (pinky and florence) this morning at C-4. i had the chance to speak with pinky yesterday, asked another friend for her number.pinky's one of my best buddies in high school.she lives nearby but not now since they transferred to caloocan.so we lost contact.she is a research anthro and is not always around cuz she is often seen in the mountains to help in the research. hehehe.  "taong bundok!"   anyways, we played badminton for almost 2 hours.  dami ko pawis sarap.  talo ko sila...yabang ba?   right now, i want to divert my attention to activities like this so i will not think too much. i haven't slept well lately and for my health's sake, i need to focus myself to sensible things other than thinking of the....whatever.  i am not in my usual self--i feel like i don't wanna talk to anybody unless needed, don't wanna go out unless needed...damn, what i'm tryin to say is that i hate you and i hate myself!!!

      sometimes i feel there's a hole inside of me, an emptiness that at times seem to burn..   i have this dream of bein whole, of not goin to bed each night wanting. but i feel sometimes when the wind is warm or the crickets sing, i dream of a love that even time will lie down and be still, for i just want someone to love me and i want to be seen...

        friendster...    i guess many will agree with me that one of the fad now is this--friendster. i was introduced to this by an officemate of mine. i'm not into it actually 'til now. well, not really. but i found it nice since i found my old friends through here (from elementary til college)   but almost all in my friend's list are really my FRIENDS and not just mere acquaintances or they were added simply because i like their profile or something. i don't like that idea adding people whom i didn't really know. don't know with the others,  'kina-career'  ata nila.  hay, i don't feel good...

       first love        it got me thinkin when JB asked me hu my first love was...honestly, i didn't really know but  told me that i have one.huh?mas alam pa niya?oh yeah, she was right,i was thinkin' that it was the guy i met after college-- GAR .well,that was his initial,all right?   it was really not comfy for me to talk about him not because i still like him,no.he was a thing of the past and yeah i can still remember him especially during the election time cuz he was a nephew of one of the presidential candidates.but that was it.  though there was no closure yet(or there is already since he just ignored the letter i sent him or he just didnt get it)all i know is that he might be married or committed to somebody already,that's all i know.  JB asked me if there was any theme song...yes-- on the wings of love by jeffrey osborne .he also gave me one of the songs of freestyle, before i let you go .  we ended the conversation there.maybe we're both uneasy to talk about it.  *****  mom,maricar and i were havin some fun awhile ago,we were singin.mom bought new karaoke vcd's to practice on...mga senti! i remembered some of the songs that was so popular during HS and college days when your ex or even you used to play as theme songs or songs that were dedicated to you right after you broke up.  1. don't give up on us 2. touch and go 3. love is all that matters 4. what matters most 5. i will always love you 6. stay etc.  wala lang.it's nice to reminisce naman sometimes, bring back memories of your past loves thought sometimes those loves gave you heartaches and tears.at least those made you stronger and a better person.that's important.

      i haven't been writing for a week, dunno if i am just lazy or i just don't know what to post in here.not that there aren't things that i shouldn't write about, just because.  ok i will try.  abbie left already and it's kinda sad. this was the first time that i really had the chance to spend some quality time with her.or is it the other way around. she's been very busy meeting old friends when she got here but thanks to her that this time she really make it up to me.not unlike last year.i made 'tampo' pa.when she was still there in the states, we were already planning to meet up with our college friends but didn't push through since she can't push it in her sked.taray di ba? *wink  yesterday, arl,JB and i went to makati-glorietta and greenbelt.why?nothing.we strolled,played at timezone,ate and coffee at starbucks.arl have been feeling kinda diffrent lately so we decided to go out and unwind.we had fun and we just talked and talked and talked.anythin under the sun.but have to go home early since im havin' tummy aches.  geesh.  JB and i were  A-ok  now. we had a  KULIT  and i can't take it.she can't even stop when i say NO or when i start making those staring eyes look.at times i really can't handle it though still manageable.that's why we're still together.but there was a time that i was pissed off and have to go out of the relationship, but then she promised me that she will lessen the kakulitan so i gave her another chance. i love her silly, that's why.

        8's a d8!    i was supposed to accompany abbsz to DM to buy some stuffs before she leaves on Sunday.  yes, she'll be leaving already..huhuhu!!! but then, something came up...my period. So I send an SMS that I couldn't go.    she called me up and told me and asked me if I can go out that night. i asked what the plan was.  JB greeted them that morning (we have the same anniversaries) and she was asking if they have plans other than buying in DM. JB wanted to go out and have dinner for 4.  She wanted to eat at Gerry’s grill in Malate. Abbie said it was ok since it's gonna be the first time she's gonna celebrate monthsary with AG since she went to NJ. So I said fine, besides I wanted to see her before she leaves.  'Cuz def'nitly I cannot come on Saturday for her despedida at Let’s house in BF. Mom will not allow me anymore and we made plans already that the family will go out this weekend.  i'll meet AG n Abbsz first in RP and will wait for JB to come. i arrived 10mins earlier than the meeting time so I decided to pass by at Humor Post to get something for my best friend and JB of course. i got Abbsz a friendship keychain wherein we'll be able to split it into 2-parts. i gave her the other half of the chain and she promised to put it in her bag.  funny thing, I forgot to take off the price tag... but I am glad she loved the token.    had caffe latte for me and mocha for AG n Abbsz at Starbucks while waiting for JB to arrive.  what a small world! we saw the 'ex' of Abbsz' ex! we immediately exchanged glances and laughed. talked about college days and each other's escapades. it’s really nice to reminisce especially when you don’t get the chance to talk to the person who knows what you are talkin'about. i mean you can really be involved and absorb the topic when the person you are talking to can share the same feeling of what you are talking about, right?   JB arrived...at last.  we let JB rests for a while then we went straight to Gerry’s. we sitted at the patio since AG n Abbsz are smoking. ordered sinigang na baboy, inihaw na pusit, crispy pla-pla with garlic, iced tea for JB n I, pink lemonade for Abbie, coke for AG. n the middle of our dinner, Abbie’s naughtiness surfaced. She asked 'bout 'sexcapades.'    ME:  The topic ah!  ABBIE : Bakit masama ba? Sasagutin din kami after.  better not ask what the questions were.  it might scandalize the conservative ears of my cousins and other friends. Hehehe!   ABBIE : Music21 tayo? Feel kong kumanta.  ME : Sige ok lang. Meron jan malapit lang.  josko naligaw pa kami. i forgot where it was.  we stayed there for almost 2 hours. had an asthma attack cuz of the smoking of my 2 friends but nevertheless, had a great time last night.   tomorrow, i'll drop by at AG’s place with JB to cook carbonara for abbie. well that would be another entry.  but right now, i will get some sleep, it's quite late. besides, our alaga might get angry.

      watched HP3 the other day... ALONE! t'was planned by me days before that i'm not goin' with anyone even JB.   i enjoyed the movie that i can watch it all over again. couldn't wait for the fourth one...i believe that the next movie will be more adventurous than the present cuz it has more highlights-the goblet of fire.  when the movie ended, i immediately ran off but there was a heavy rain pour. so i decided to buy shrek2 dvd. watched it when i got home..t'was a mirthful movie. the character's hilarious esp antonio and eddie murphy.  sigh. this blog is no good. it only shows that im really in a perplexed mood right now.  maybe the reason why i love colors is that when i see beautiful colors especially when i needed one, is that it makes everything lighter. it really makes my day when i'm sad.   i know that life's full of flaw's and my life is no excemption.the more you try to have a perfect life,you just couldn't. cuz there's no such thing. what i'm trying to say is that i am trying to make things right but at the end of the day, you will realize that at times it is impossible to achieve becuz the people around just can't comprehend with the way you wanted it to be.  i sometimes wish that a fairy will come to my room one day and just be a confidante and will share some of her magical stuffs with me. so everytime i don't feel good i'll just use her wand and i will go to a far away place or near the rainbow, anywhere where i can create my own world with so many colors.

         last friday my friends and i went to EK-Enchanted Kingdom, the Philippines’ first and only world-class theme park. t'was planned way before my bestfriend went home from the land of milk and honey.  i've been there several times but like a child, am always excited and too thrilled when we are talkin about this park. not that i'm so overwhelmed with the rides since i don't ride that much (scared!) i just love the ambience and the color-purple.i can come here almost every weekend...  first thing we tried was the flying fiesta. yiiiii!!!! sarap!!! nakakahilo nga lang...hehehe! then...  kart track.race aficionados will love the latest addition to EK's family entertainment mix -- the 600-meter go-kart track, called "Kart Trak," at the park's Spaceport zone. built according to international standards by the Carmona Racing Circuit and Batangas Racing Circuit, Kart Track has one-seater and two-seater karts, plus "cadet" class karts for kids ages 8 to 12. the track follows specifications by both the Fedearation Internationale De L'Automobile (FIA) and the Confederation Internationale de Karting (CIK) for performance and safety. each kart has ample horsepower and acceleration to provide riders with speed and thrills.      way too cool!i was so excited that my wallet fell down, and had scratches.tsk!tsk! good thing i still have some at home.hehehe!!!!  i've also enjoyed the rio-grande rapids.     we got wet but t'was fun!         oh this one i tried with a friend before. didn't have any plans of goin but talo ako sa pustahan so i have to. no choice. but geeeesshh, i was literally shakin when i went down. my friends now were askin me to try it again but i said NO. once is enough.. i still wanna live!!!         hey, my friend's partner asked me to ride on this, i said no(again, i'm scared) but as expected, gave in. i was tryin to convince her at the last minute that i can't do it. my heart was pulpitating so fast but she didn't allow me. there goes. i was shakin in the middle of the ride, though she was tryin to make me feel good. after several minutes, t'was over. i was teary-eyed then. instead of a word of comfort, SOMEBODY laughed. so next time, i will not ride those shits again or i will not go with her anymore. right.  7:30pm, we headed to laguna...that's another story, or would rather not tell anything since there's nothing special happened in there. actually, if i have a way, would just go home instead...  generally, t'was fun...

          I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart     This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore     I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on her hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do   * i'm so in love with these guys these days.....

       confused..     dunno what exactly am feelin right now.bothered,worried,confused,mad...i'm feeling those at the same time,mind you.  i wanted to put it into writing but couldn't find the right words.  i just can't help but wonder.why are there people who doesn't seem to know what they're doing? when reprimanded, that's the time they will realize that they've done the wrong one.is it just being naive or what?is it just being curious?i really don't know.  can't seem to find the answers to my questions.  there is this feeling that makes me wanna understand and believe cuz i love the person i am with and i want to believe you are innocent. but i also have this feeling that i do not want to believe anymore.i am hurting...i know you are,too.  you cannot blame me if i feel that you are getting tired of the relationship already as well as i feel like you are looking even if you are not.you made me feel this way.at this time,all the reasons and excuses hardly sink in to my system.no matter what you say and do is useless.

      i've been busy lately--dealing with the ink refill business my 2 friends and i were putting up, and at the same time dealing with some emotional problems.  it's not that easy balancing these things but i don't have any choice, do i? i'm so excited about this cuz this is going to be our first venture and lanie,ag's friend is going to help us set-up this one. we'll start training by next week. weeee!!!! im so excited! i just hope that lanie will not give us a hard time. lanz yuhuuu! i have to learn some marketing skills cuz tito (AG's dad-who is a city assessor in mandaluyong) will endorse me to some of their clients so i'd better do good. aside from that, i guess we won't be having problems getting some prospective clients since we have so many friends that i think can help us--word of mouth.  i had a talk with mom---again regarding j--again, and about this business. she's scared that it might not work which i don't want to think. we have to be optimistic on this. there's no place for negative thoughts. told my friends that i understand and that i don't have any bad feelings towards mom whatsoever. i don't know if i'm trying to convince myself or other people when i say that. guess not. i really do understand. and i'm quite grateful that we did have that talk since i was able to tell her what she really wanted to hear without hurting her feelings that much. uhmmm, don't you think so? i think.  you know, even if there were times that we resort to arguments or petty quarrels, i still think it's part of our relationship as mother and daughter. i mean we are close that's why we get into this. i love them both and i don't want to lose any of them.
