      Once again, this is another post which Jake will hate.&nbsp; It is simply the retelling of a regular&nbsp;day I had.&nbsp;   6:45 A.M., Wednesday, July the 28th, 2004.&nbsp; My alarm sounds, followed by me hitting the snooze three times.&nbsp; 7:15 I wake up and get showered.&nbsp; After jumping in my car and pulling out of my driveway, I begin my morning prayer.&nbsp; Just as I get ready to turn onto eldridge, I remember I forgot my social security card.&nbsp; I U-Turn and pick that up with very little time to spare.&nbsp; God Answers all prayers.  I make it to Nesbits in ample time and begin work for that day.&nbsp; Nothing particulalry interesting happened that day at work.&nbsp; Outside of having a short, mexican lady come and tell me why I'm stupid.&nbsp; I hate people who never graduated high school tell me I'm stupid.&nbsp; There's just something wrong with that.&nbsp; Nesbits is not to bad.&nbsp; I can actually go to the restroom or sit down every so often, much unlike Rib-Tickler once was.&nbsp; I rue the days I worked there!&nbsp; After six hours of work, I make my way home and begin preperation for the bible study I would be leading in about 5 hours.&nbsp;   The 'preperation' that lasted from 2:15-4:45 was mostly me staring at my computer screen and then a bible.&nbsp; Followed by about an hour and a half of watching television.&nbsp; I print the bible study sheet out, jump in my car and drive towards Prince of Peace.&nbsp; Already there is Matt R. and his wife Stephanie with their baby girl of 3 months, Mary Clare Regitz.&nbsp; As I tend to do around kittens and cute babies, I stammered around and expelled some giberish.&nbsp; Smith showed up and we sat down to practice.&nbsp; Thankfully enough, I was able to neutralize a majority of the monopoly he originally had over our bible study (which was originally MY idea to begin with).&nbsp; I sat him down and told him how things were going to be.&nbsp; 'I do this, you do this.&nbsp; Got it?&nbsp; Good.'&nbsp; I made a few copies, and he wrote some 'burdens' down on popsicle sticks for the bible study.&nbsp; We go to church and say a quick prayer, then he starts practicing for Praise n' worship.&nbsp; I go and bug Matt for a little bit, followed by him kicking me out of his office and into the youth room to start PnW.&nbsp;   For praise n worship, I sat in the front corner and nodded my head to the music.&nbsp; I felt overly charismatic that night!&nbsp; As people begin entering the room, my head looks for her.&nbsp; The one person I actually wanted to see that night, the one who I wanted to see me.&nbsp; A while ago, I promised myself that I would finally confess that I have feelings for her the next time I saw her.&nbsp; After thirty minutes and her not being there, I came to the obvious truth that she wouldn't be there.&nbsp; Praise n Worship ends, and bible study begins.&nbsp; I tell a crappy joke, and then introduce our topic for tonight.&nbsp; 'What burdens us from God'?&nbsp; The bible study started off rather smoothly, but eventually picked up after Smith and I got the hang of it.&nbsp; Just as we finished our discussion on the first verse, she entered the room.&nbsp; Smelly, unkempt, wearing a dirty&nbsp;PoP t-shirt and nasty shorts.&nbsp; Beautiful.&nbsp; It took me about five seconds to draw my attention back to the bible study.&nbsp; I was enthralled.&nbsp;   Smith begins his popsicle stick plan... Disaster.&nbsp; The thing was a debachery and poorly executed.&nbsp; I looked to Matt and told him I wish we had thought about splitting into groups beforehand.&nbsp; Oh well, it wasn't a complete failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt like going around to see how the small groups were interacting.&nbsp; Yeah, I basically went to see her and that was it.&nbsp; Was it very obvious?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp;   Finally, we had the people there write down their burdens, and put them on nails in a big cross we have.&nbsp; It was hilarious though, having people come up there and have trouble putting their paper on the nails.&nbsp; Half of them ripped.&nbsp; We ended quietly with Dave playin some music.&nbsp; I'd say the whole event was a success.&nbsp; Matt wanted to know if we'd ever do it again.&nbsp; I said if he ever wanted us to.&nbsp;   I went to go talk to her as soon as I could.&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed to talk to her, to hug her, to be with her.&nbsp; We stayed and talked for a good 5-10 minutes.&nbsp; Many a time did she mention her boyfriend though.&nbsp; Not necissarily what I wanted to hear, but at least it was her who was speaking.&nbsp; I enjoyed the evening well enough.&nbsp;   I gave her a hug goodbye and she was gone.&nbsp; Didn't tell her I had feelings for her.&nbsp; Just said i 'might' have sent her&nbsp;an email.&nbsp; Didn't tell her it was an email I made just for her so I could send her one email.&nbsp;   Stephanie had left with Mary Clare earlier so Matt was without a car.&nbsp; He asked me if I could take him home, and seeing as how he did the day before we started bombing Iraq, I was more than happy too.&nbsp; Plus he lived about 2 minutes from my house.&nbsp; So we drove, and we chatted the whole way there.&nbsp; It's great talking to him.&nbsp; We talked about CtR's inferior bible study, our bible study, retreats and what not.&nbsp; He said he wanted to continue that conversation with me over coffee some time.&nbsp; I'll be meeting him tomorow 2:30 at common grounds coffee house.&nbsp; I hate coffee.&nbsp;   Well, I'm in lakewood park, and lost.&nbsp; Who do I know who lives there?&nbsp; None other than THE shannon lam.&nbsp; So i called her, she rescues me from my being lost, and we conversate for a while.&nbsp; I was pissed we didnt hang out last week, but oh well.&nbsp; She said she'd get her sister's-boyfriend to pirate me anime, so I'm happy.&nbsp; She went back to her house to pack, I went home to get online.&nbsp;   She was online.&nbsp; First time I've ever seen her online.&nbsp; She was checking email or something.&nbsp; We spoke for a while and it was awesome.&nbsp; She signed off, and I went to bed.&nbsp; My day was over at 11:30...    See you space cowboy...

      I constantly question myself.&nbsp; Am I doing the right thing, and if so, then who is it right for?&nbsp; Few people can scratch past my surface.&nbsp; Very few in fact.&nbsp; That is because I quell most of the hateful feelings that I have.&nbsp; That doesn't mean I never complain, it just means I could complain a lot more.&nbsp; From what i have gathered, I do this because of my parents.&nbsp; Every time I'd come home from school and tell them that friend x pushed me or called me a dumb name, (honeybutt was fairly common back in the day), my parents would immediatly issue a fatwa against them.&nbsp; Nothing that person could do would redeem themselves in my parents eyes.&nbsp; They would openly express every other time I mention that person, in good light or bad, how little they think of them.&nbsp; That really bugs me.&nbsp; I've been a jerk to all of my friends and vise versa.&nbsp; My parents hear about next to none of this though, because I don't want them to bash my friends whom I forgive on my own accord.&nbsp; I HATE when my parents do that.&nbsp; What are they trying to prove?  For example, I invited a few guys to my bible study this week.&nbsp; Not one of them attended even after having said they would enjoy going.&nbsp; Yes, I was hurt, and I felt slightly betrayed.&nbsp; Yet, I shall not mention this to my parents because I have slipped on&nbsp;other occasions as well.&nbsp; I am not perfect, nor are my friends.&nbsp; My parents believe themselves to be though, and consequently anyone who hints imperfection is immediatly dead to them.&nbsp;   I hesitated to tell them about Jackie.&nbsp; Still to this day, they are unaware of about 75% of our relationship.&nbsp; Inheretly I knew it would flounder in one way or the other.&nbsp; I knew something would blow up.&nbsp; I hate being right all the time.&nbsp; But I dare not tell them the what the real conclusion of that book was, for in the unlikely event I ever speak to her again, they would frown upon it.&nbsp; I carry these burdens, these lies on my back.&nbsp; Though I know not the reason for doing so.&nbsp; What good have I accomplished?&nbsp; Who am I serving?&nbsp; Not myself, that much is true.&nbsp; I do not have a friend whom I can converse with about everything.&nbsp; Ben for politics, Jake for girls/girl problems, Nathan for gaming/school crap, and Gus for obscure and unimportant things.&nbsp; I dare not talk to Ben about girls, nor about politics with Jake.&nbsp;   So now we're at the conclusion.&nbsp; I met this one girl.&nbsp; Jackie is physically more attractive than her.&nbsp; But she is so much more  beautiful  than Jackie could ever be.&nbsp; I could stare into her eyes for two eternities.&nbsp; It's not just the beauty in her eyes though.&nbsp; I can see past them into an keen and unbridled intelect.&nbsp; Aye she is smart.&nbsp; Words fail me when attempting to describe her.&nbsp; I am a writer: pictures to words, events to words, words to even better words.&nbsp; Still, I couldn't conjure up anything to capture her.&nbsp; She just is.&nbsp;   Enter inreconcileable flaw: Boyfriend.&nbsp; How that accursed word plauges me when not attatched  to  me.&nbsp; She cares for him deeply, every time she's off doing something, she is with him, or so it seems.&nbsp; She once told me she loves me as a friend, and him as a boyfriend.&nbsp; So it's all about choice.&nbsp; Altruism or selfishness.&nbsp; Putting myself in the boyfriend's shoes, I would hate me for doing what I want to do.&nbsp; Break them up and seat myself in his position.&nbsp; Yet back inside my own shoes, which I am more fond of wearing, that seems perfect.&nbsp; Why concern myself with someone I've only met once?&nbsp; Does my being kind prevent others from hurting me?&nbsp; What debt do I owe, what cross must I carry, but more importantly why?&nbsp; Perhaps my selfishness is not right, but it would ease my pain.&nbsp; What must one do to attain true contentment?&nbsp; What journey, what storm must be braved?&nbsp; Am Ieven ready?    Fight on noble paladin...

      Ordinarily I think this goes without saying, but my Catholic beliefs are VERY liberal.&nbsp; In fact, I'm just a liberal Christian, Catholic nothin'.&nbsp; I believe the Church has the most legitimacy amongst the other Christian faiths, which is why I choose be Catholic.&nbsp; When I say 'legitimacy', do not get defensive, for I do not believe that our 'faith' is more realistic than any other.&nbsp; Faith is simply that, faith.&nbsp; No faith is more or less valid than the next, it's simply a matter of your beliefs.&nbsp; I weigh Catholic legitimacy in the sense that we abide by some tradition, in fact, almost total tradition.&nbsp; There are over 3,500 Christian denominations in the US alone.&nbsp; The reason is not a matter of 'faith' per se.&nbsp; We all have faith in God, it is a matter of practice.&nbsp; 'I don't like that preacher', is all you need to split off and form a new church nowadays.&nbsp; Now, to many churches and christian denominations are fighting over the most moronic of things, the most insignificant of practices.&nbsp; Perhaps I am blind to truth, but it seems that modern day Christianity has inverted Christs' original message.&nbsp; To love.  Christ was a liberal, there is no doubt about it.&nbsp; The moral of Jesus' life was not about proper rites on the sabbath, or how much you put in the collection basket.&nbsp; It wasn't about praise and worship, or praying through saints.&nbsp; It wasn't about 'accepting him into your heart as your personal savior'.&nbsp; Those are all creations of men, and because of that, they are flawed and give rise to sin.&nbsp; The moral Jesus came to teach, was to love without ceasing.&nbsp; Be a good person.&nbsp; Clothe the naked, feed the hungry.&nbsp; Don't push a bible into someone's hands and tell them why they are cursed to hell if they don't read and believe.&nbsp; Amen I say to you, a bible forced down a man's throat shall not change them, but showing them the kindness spoken from within shall.&nbsp;   Most would call me atheist, or hethen because I do not subscribe to the orthodox belief that saying Christ's name grants entry into heaven.&nbsp; Indeed, it was said, 'no man may come unto the father unless it is through me'.&nbsp; I believe that to mean that Jesus came as a means of salvation for all, not those who learned about him in Sunday school when they were young.&nbsp;   Let me allude to the end of Matrix Revolutions for a moment.&nbsp; Neo struggled to stand on both feet in the pouring rain, Smith clones all around him.&nbsp; By this time, every side of the war was aimed on him.&nbsp; He was hated by the machines, by Smith (satan), and even by some of humanity (Jews), but in the end, he realized the choice he had to make.&nbsp; Sacrifice.&nbsp; Neo died not to save just humanity.&nbsp; Neo made himself the lamb of the passover to save all life, machine and flesh.&nbsp; Likewise, Jesus did not come to save the righteous, for they already were saved.&nbsp; Jesus came to save the lowly prostitue, or the foul tax collector.&nbsp;   It has been said that Jesus exists in all of us.&nbsp; Many a person attends 'cougars for Christ' at Tomball and expects to see Him most present there.&nbsp; Nay, I believe if you look at the hated, the despised of Tomball, you shall find Jesus.&nbsp; Outcast, abandoned, alone.&nbsp; I freely admit, I am in great fault.&nbsp; I have taken pleasure in hurting others.&nbsp; I am not inclusive.&nbsp; I hate many others.&nbsp; There are few redeeming qualities that I possess.&nbsp; I am just a voice crying out in the desert.    Make straight the way of the Lord...

       'can't explain all the feelings that you're makin' me feel...'   Oh heckly, what a week.&nbsp; I suppose I'm in that transition phase of my post-relationship-angst.&nbsp; It starts off with that strong pain in your stomach at the very sight of the person.&nbsp; Then the adamant hatred and malice.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, was the 'I desperately need a warm body to fill the gap left behind'.&nbsp; Now it's the, 'life is life, now its up to me to live it'.&nbsp; At the current rate, do I wish I never met her, yeah.&nbsp; But who knows, she may have taught me a valuable lesson I have yet to learn, or sown seeds that will inspire me to find my true companion.&nbsp; But because I do see time as a four demensional spectre, I'm pissed, and wish we never met.&nbsp;   Time for me to live life again.&nbsp; Jake got back today, well... I guess yesterday, I've been lanning for almost 10 hours, so the whole time concept is blurry right now.&nbsp; Jake is really the only person I can sit down and talk to about this whole catastrophe.&nbsp; Who else?&nbsp; My parents, haha.&nbsp; Samantha, why would she care?&nbsp; We're mavericks as he once said, he shall help me brave this storm, and I him.&nbsp;   I hate uncertainty.&nbsp; I hate not knowing what comes next, or where to go with this.&nbsp; That's why I can't stand those who are smiling one minute, and stabbing you in the back the next.&nbsp; I'm okay with assholes, but shifty assholes, I cannot stand.&nbsp; I wish I could peer into the future and see that everything will be okay.&nbsp; To see that I have conducted my journey in the best possible way, to see that I will not be alone forever.&nbsp;   I was talking to Dave (youth minister), and he asked me, 'what one certainty is there in this world, what always is always?'.&nbsp; After thinking for a couple of seconds, my answer was, 'death'.&nbsp; Life is always followed by death.&nbsp; That is the only certainty I have.&nbsp; No guarentees were made to me at my conception but that one.&nbsp; No one told me I would get married, have kids and live a happy life.&nbsp; Only that my life would be followed by death.&nbsp; That I suppose, is the nihilist point of view.&nbsp; Where I differ from the seemingly pessimistic and apocolyptic fate that nihilism describes, is that I have no fate.&nbsp; No one guarenteed me a happy life, or a beautfiul wife.&nbsp; Therefore, I must be the reaper of my own fate.&nbsp; I must control my actions, not submit to temptation.&nbsp; May I have strength to carry on.&nbsp;   I once described my journey as a walk down a road.&nbsp; Something set and simple to follow.&nbsp; I was in error.&nbsp; I am lone on a small raft, floating in the torrents of life.&nbsp; Temptation, hatred, doubt and fear all crashing against the few logs I've put together as my life.&nbsp; I will be strong, I have enough strength to defeat these waves, to brave this tempest.    He sheaths Xylothin and looks out into the endless abyss, with&nbsp;a smile...

      So it's about 4 am right now.&nbsp; I just played Tales of Symphonia for a good while and decided to look back on past entries.&nbsp; I scrolled down to my first few that mentioned Jackie.&nbsp; Gosh, it was probably 4/22.&nbsp; Three months ago.&nbsp; Three months ago I could just see the tip of her destructive force creeping out.&nbsp; 'I'm not a good girlfriend'.&nbsp; Why didn't I listen?&nbsp; I was so blinded, so suckered in by those brown eyes.&nbsp; My God, I am a fool.&nbsp; I was a hold off, a&nbsp;temporary.&nbsp; She would say things like, 'Bryan, if I stopped talking to you I would just die'.&nbsp; Well, as far as I know she's still alive.&nbsp; WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN TO MY FRIENDS?&nbsp; MYSELF?&nbsp; MY PARENTS?&nbsp; Everyone was telling me to get out.&nbsp; Everyone.&nbsp; Samantha kept instilling faith in me, saying we were a great couple.&nbsp; THERE WAS NO COUPLE!&nbsp; It was her dragging me around to satisfy her own interests.&nbsp; Jackie kept telling me she'd mature, she'd  want  a relationship,  eventually .&nbsp; Even Jackie's mom said that she would do this.&nbsp; Why could I not see a definite problem here?&nbsp; Am I so ignorant, so blind to my own senses?&nbsp; If the mother of the girl you're trying to date tells you not out of malice, but sympathy that her daughter will posion my heart, there must be some great wrong.&nbsp; Nay, I was arrogant.&nbsp; I thought I could walk through, unscathed.&nbsp; I wanted to brave the storm and prove to myself what a good guy I was.&nbsp; How her inherent nature would be overcome by my charm and good nature.&nbsp; How decieved I was.&nbsp;   I could see the end from the very begining, but I was paralyzed.&nbsp; I have once been told, that 'dating is for dumping', and that 'you should draw a realization of what you want in a wife, from every person you date'.&nbsp; I would agree.&nbsp; I learned two things from Jackie.&nbsp;  First, if your friends, your girlfriend, your girlfriend's mom, and your own parents tell you something is wrong, they're probably right and you should reevaluate the relationship you are pursuing.&nbsp;  Second, I  need  a relationship that is a constant battle.&nbsp; All she ever talked to me about was, 'yeah, sarah beth blah blah', 'james showed me his wang', 'I'm wearing that skirt you hate', 'American Idol is cool', and other useless information, not worth a neuron in my skull.&nbsp; I want someone whose very look sends me into argument.&nbsp; If she would argue, it would end with, 'I hate arguing w/ you', or some rhetoric which she is saying simply to change subjects.&nbsp; I need my relationship to be a battlefield, and my girlfriend and I to be opposing armies.&nbsp; I want debate without concession.&nbsp; I want the battlefield to be stained red with our blood.&nbsp; My father's wife does not argue w/ him.&nbsp; He comes from an earlier era and that is to his liking.&nbsp; My brother however, cannot go ten minutes without arguing with Elizabeth, and they love each other intensely.&nbsp; That is what I want.&nbsp; I want to find a girl who is on par with me.&nbsp; Someone I can cross swords with and be unwary.&nbsp; If she was a gamer, all the hotter.&nbsp; But she  MUST , be someone I respect and more importantly  fear  intellectually.&nbsp;     I believe in a thing called love...

      Well, within not five entries of my new journal, I have recieved quite a hateful comment.&nbsp; I do have that effect on people, no?&nbsp; As always, the person left it unsigned, thus preventing me from knowing where my justification lies.&nbsp; Though I have my assumptions, I dare not make accusations, for that is never a productive attempt.&nbsp; Let me move on to why the commentary is&nbsp;false, and where it is not false, biased and ludacris.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The first attack made upon me is saying how 'I'm too hard on people', and that 'no one crosses the great Sir Bryan'.&nbsp; Let me first ask who lives with humility.&nbsp; Is it the person who has countless shoes and matching outfits, someone who addresses herself as 'Princess Jackie'.&nbsp; Does a person who live in humility say, 'Everyone at my church says I could totally get any guy I want'?&nbsp; I fail to see then how I am pompous and arrogant when I wear the same pair of shorts for a week, and am in a constant state of abusing myself verbally.&nbsp; Nay, I say to you that I am not arrogant. &nbsp; Second, is the statement that, 'I took advantage of her because she was so young'.&nbsp; What advantage was taken might I ask?&nbsp; You then bring up the stunning and unavoidable argument, 'If you really liked me than, blah blah blah'.&nbsp; Tell me what it is that I forced her into doing?&nbsp; If I can recall correctly, it was her who said, 'Bryan, don't you ever just want to go out and have fun, forget your morals and ethics for a day?'.&nbsp; I would argue that I put forth an attempt to instill some morals into her.&nbsp; Did I now have her promise me she wouldn't drink so long as we went out?&nbsp; Did I not tell her how badly I cringed when she explained to me of her 'fun' summers in Mexico?&nbsp; Did I not convince her (partially) that homosexuality is not a choice?&nbsp; Amen I say to you, I would go so far as to say that I did more good for her than bad, and wise men would be at my side.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Third is the lies this unsigned individual spewed forth not three sentences later, claiming that Jackie told me, 'she just wanted to be friends'.&nbsp; She did not, nor does not have any idea what it is that she wants.&nbsp; I say this without insult for she has freely admited this to myself, her mother and others on multiple occasions.&nbsp; If she truely wanted to be friends, then why did it matter if I did not recipricate her love, or that I had feelings for Lindsay.&nbsp; What then, if she truely wanted to be friends, would seperate me from the countless others at her church, or at school (James for instance) who she flirts with?&nbsp; It makes little sense to me that I am considered to have been pressuring her when I responded after her 'I love you', phone call with, 'I'm just not feeling the same about you'.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Finally, let us consider the attacks made upon me at DYC.&nbsp; I, 'pretended not to notice her when she did her skit'.&nbsp; In truthfulness, had I pretended not to notice her during the skit, I would have looked directly into her eyes and seen nothing.&nbsp; But nay, I looked away, for I knew that seeing her would only swell the pain that was growing inside me at that time.&nbsp; Yes, I too felt pain through the debauchery that was our hollowed relationship.&nbsp; I too was distraught throughout the weekend.&nbsp; What person would follow someone around who treats them as though they are nothing and plays them as a yo-yo? Next on the list was my phone conversation w/ Nathan that Jackie was present for.&nbsp; I will freely admit that I said on the phone to Nathan, 'Bye nathan, now give me kisses'.&nbsp; Let me pose the question though, does that surprise any of my friends?&nbsp; I say no, for all are aware that though I will act gay and blatantly support gay rights, I am the straightest individual whom has ever walked on American soil.&nbsp; It is because I am aware of this and not afraid of homosexuality that I can do these things.&nbsp; Pardon me for not being ignorant and lifeless.&nbsp; Jackie more than likely simply used that as an excuse to end the relationship when she was already in cohorts w/ John. And finally I was attacked for arguing with the lady.&nbsp; It was 'embarassing how condescending I was'.&nbsp; I admit, I was more abrasive than I intended to be during that 'great debate' I had with the speaker.&nbsp; That however, was not my intention, after I left the room I told my PoP friends that my message was not to offend, but to inspire and enlighten.&nbsp; I told them that I felt the Holy Spirit flowing through me as the lady and I clashed swords.&nbsp; Not only did I humble myself afterwords to my friends, but after everyone had exited the room I returned to thank the speaker.&nbsp; I told her, 'Thank you very much for your talk ma'am.&nbsp; It was very powerful and I was touched by your story, I can only hope and pray that there was someone who is going through what you did and understood what they need do'.&nbsp; Is that the rebuttal of someone who is condescending?&nbsp; And if it was so embarassing to have listened to me, why did so many clap, why was I congratulated? &nbsp;   Please sign your name next time, this debate is not over...

      To summarize my experience at DYC, I would have to use the word 'bittersweet'.&nbsp; On one hand, it was a great way for me to unleash the furies of my debating prowess and strengthen my own beliefs.&nbsp; And simultaneously, it was a weekend filled with malice and angst.&nbsp; So while I was becoming a stonger Catholic, I was being weakened physically and mentally in the process thereof. &nbsp; First let us go into why my weekend was rewarding.&nbsp; I am one of the few in my church who believe that gay marraige, or rights for that matter is acceptable.&nbsp; This became a big topic of discussion throughout the weekend between me and others.&nbsp; At one point in time, I was sitting in on a workshop regarding the Church's views on certain political issues.&nbsp; The speaker came out and said how she came within a day of aborting her child, but a vision from God allowed her the wisdom not too.&nbsp; Very touching story.&nbsp; Afterwords, she went into checking off the do's and don'ts when it comes to politics and our faith.&nbsp; Capital punishment=bad, Abortion=Very Bad, Masturbation and Contraception = bad, etc.&nbsp; With five minutes before we had to depart, I had Samantha raise her hand to ask the question, "what is the Church's view on gay marraige?".&nbsp; Promptly the lady responded, "Why obviously we're opposed to it" &nbsp; Just before she began to close, I raised my hand and asked, "Excuse me ma'am.&nbsp; Did you  choose  to love your husband?&nbsp; Was that a concious decision you sat down and made?" &nbsp; Lady, "Well, actually, the Church does not believe that being gay in and of its self is gay, merely the sexual act of being gay since it is out of marraige.&nbsp; The Church calls homosexuals to live a life of chastity." &nbsp; Me, "Well then wouldn't it make sense to allow gay marraige, thus making their actions inside marraige and therefore unsinful?&nbsp; Should I be prevented from living a full life with my partner because I was born differently than you?" &nbsp; Lady, "Well, actually, the Church is pro-life.&nbsp; They believe that too people are wed and have sex to reproduce.&nbsp; Obviously two men or two women can not have sex and reproduce.&nbsp; Therefore, if two people have sex without the intention of reproducing, its immoral." &nbsp; Me *grand finale*, "So ma'am, are you trying to tell me that a sterile couple shouldn't be allowed to have sex?&nbsp; They are just as incapable of reproducing as the average gay couple.&nbsp; Where is the difference?" &nbsp; Lady, "that's all the time we have for today" &nbsp; I then get a standing ovation.&nbsp; Ah, there are few things in this world that equate to, going into a room to learn a thing or two, and then being the one who gets applause.&nbsp; So outside of learning more about what I believe in and getting into constant battles over faith and our religious practices, I got little else out of the weekend.&nbsp; But that was a hella lot. &nbsp; On the opposite side of this coin, I went in attendence with many others from my church who went to Steubenville, a charasmatic event.&nbsp; Lots of singing, adoration, etc.&nbsp; From what I hear it's eight fold what challenge retreat is.&nbsp; So half of my PoP people were running around me the whole time saying that this weekend sucks in comparison to Steubenville.&nbsp; That's cool to believe that and what not, but to come off as arrogant and opressive is quite another thing.&nbsp; It seemed like segregation.&nbsp; And personally, I would give up the chance to EVER go to Steubenville just as long as I got to see my brother put that golden ring on Elizabeth.&nbsp; I don't care what a religious experience that is, I love my brother more than anyone, living, dead or celestial.&nbsp; I fight and bitch at him, but he is my brother and I love him.&nbsp; So to hear I'm a bad person for not going, makes me a little angry.&nbsp;  &nbsp; To top that off, Jackie was floating around a multitude of guys, explaining how I mean nothing to her.&nbsp; It's that feeling you get in your stomach you know?&nbsp; Jake knows it, and I know it.&nbsp; And few things can erase that feeling.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   The sun is always set on my side of the world...

      When we first started conversing, Jackie told me she was afraid of commitment.&nbsp; Apparently some time ago, she had a major crush on some guy, who later dumped her for someone she found to be less attractive than herself.&nbsp; After this 'heartbreak', she wrote her crush a fat email explaining what a horrible person he is and how he's doomed to a life of angst and suffering.&nbsp;  &nbsp; How fitting that she left me for not someone, but something.&nbsp; She left me to be 'free', to be capable of doing whatever she wants without fear of that bad feeling you get, knowing you've hurt someone.&nbsp; Likewise, I do not believe what it is she left me for is more attractive than I, so I wrote her an email, thus allowing her to experience what she did to another.&nbsp; To show her that she is no better than he. &nbsp; " Jackie,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you can accept my apology.&nbsp; Since Battle of the Bands I have been holding you back and doing you wrong.&nbsp; You're nothing but a flirt.&nbsp; That's all you do, you flirt then walk away.&nbsp; So by attempting to be your boyfriend, I prevented you from spreading your wings.&nbsp; Likewise, you were/are a burden to me since we first met.&nbsp; How foolish I was to suspect 'you' could be a girlfriend.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake has once told me, "you don't go out w/ someone to be cool, you go out with someone because they make you happy."&nbsp; In all honesty, you haven't made me happy in proportion to your ill treatment of me.&nbsp; You lead me on like a siren and then do an about face.&nbsp; You call me when you're on vacation, no doubt checking out every guy there, crying and telling me you're in love.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; Don't call me, don't IM me, don't talk to me if you ever come to my bible study.&nbsp; I don't want you to pretend you give a shit about me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's more, you treat me like a platonic friend, but cry whenever I mention another girl who I'm interested in.&nbsp; Then, at DYC you hang on some guy and tell Sam about it.&nbsp; I felt a little crappy for a while after seeing and hearing about that.&nbsp; Could I blame you though?&nbsp; All I could do was weep for the poor fool you were seducing next.&nbsp; Maybe he just wants a 'fun' couple of minutes.&nbsp; I'll bet you ten bucks he won't put a smile on your face when you go to sleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't want that though.&nbsp; I mean come on, you flirt w/ everyone, that is what you want.&nbsp; No need at all to stay true to one person when you can have them all right?&nbsp; Well, all except one now.&nbsp; And don't shed any more tears over me, I don't really care, or have any desire to bear the responsibility.&nbsp; I figure if you'll be selfish enough to do what you have to me, I have some right to take interest in myself.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just hope that you can find someone who will take interest in you.&nbsp; Someone who can put up with your capricious nature and passion for clothes.&nbsp; Hopefully you marry into wealth, or else you probably won't be really happy.&nbsp; Keep searching though, there has got to be someone out there who loves you and who makes you feel good.&nbsp; Someone who can make you smile, and will smile just the same when you ignore them.&nbsp; When you treat them like they're nothing.&nbsp; When you value the chase more than the catch.&nbsp; But as for catches, I'm the one that got away.&nbsp; Damn.  &nbsp;  Sir Bryan  &nbsp;  PS: enjoy the rest of your natural life " &nbsp;   It's all about the choices we make...

      I remember the simpsons long ago where Lisa tried to determine if a mouse was smarter than Bart.&nbsp; During one of her tests, she attatched electrodes to a cupcake, so by attempting to touch it, Bart would get a sudden shock.&nbsp; He grabbed it, got shocked, then did it several other times.&nbsp; Bart did not realize that even though the cupcake would be tastey, it only hurt him. &nbsp; That is my relationship with Jackie in a nutshell.&nbsp; I think to myself, 'hey, she's a pretty gal with a great deal of wisdom and knowledge on her head.&nbsp; A relationship is possible and would yeild good things for me'.&nbsp; Yet every time I tried to get close, every time I showed interest in her, she stung me.&nbsp; Either by claimed to want a platonic friendship, or just ignoring me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   "you know that feeling you get deep in your stomach when someone you care about betrays you?"

      Prolouge to a Mack part I - 12/8/2001  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Up until about 8th grade I had not had a girlfriend before. Finally I asked out this one girl who I barely knew. It wasn't really a physical relationship, or a speaking one, it was more just flirtatious gestures from time to time. To my dismay it ended because of a lack of trust. I now consider it more of a test run for my relationships.  Then came the time when I had sharpened my skills around females and began to actually hit on someone. This ended worse than I could have possibly imagined. The person I began to mack on was a band person, which made things difficult to begin with. Band took up two class periods and we had a completly differnt lunch so I could spend a maximum of one period with her. Every chance I got I would call her and try to be with her, seeing as how that would only be about a half hour a day. Our school was having an astroworld field trip that year and my girlfriend and I were both going. So I was thinking, "un un uh, I'm gonna get me some this trip." We picked partners before we started going out so I had to walk all over the park looking for her. When I found her I was like, "hey hows it going, wanna step out for a moment..."  "uh no I'd rather sit here and flirt with your best friend."(didnt actually say this)  So I was following her around trying to chat with her and every time I'd get a word in she'd start talking to Mr. X, my best friend. Needless to say it was a bad field trip.  Somehow I forgave her, and our relationship was fine for about a week or two more. Then I'm like, "alright, astroworld sucked, so now being my birth-day, I'm really gonna get some... Oh yeah." So I walk up to her before school started and she goes in a strange tone "oh Bryan here... happy-birthday..." and hands me a note. I get to class and read the first two lines:  Happy birthday Bryan!!!  I'm breaking up with you for Mr. X  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Prolouge to a Mack Part 2 - 12/9/2001  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Continued from "Prolouge to a Mack Part 1"  I was crushed, nothing can match the heart-break I felt. That single note sent my self-esteem to a dark ages. And I was like that until the summer...  I finally got involved with my churches youth-group that summer and I was overwhelmed by what a pleasant enviorment it was. I had never been in a happier place. Soon a some of the hot girls there began to hit on me, so I'm all like, "well ya know mabye the long-term kinda relationship aint for me. Ya know mabye I was put on this earth just to knock someone." Soon enough came this confrence thing where the whole youth group goes for about two days or so. During that time I hit on a total of three girls.  Girl #1: I began to get my mack on, and it was working pretty well until this stalker guy started to rival me so I backed off.  Girl #2: This time I started and right off the bat she goes, "uh get off me; you're gay", well that sucked.  Girl #3: Finally I started to make some progress; This girl and I gave off some flirtatious gestures from time to time, small talk, ya know the good stuff. Finally when the dance came time I walked up to her and she said, "Oh uh... I can't be around someone all day... bye!"  I began to realize an actual relationship is what I really needed in my life.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Prolouge to a Mack Part 3 - 12/12/2001  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Okay, so I'm not that great of a mack, lets face it. It was that time I said, "God, I'm not a Mack, and my relationships don't work out so well. Give me some guidence." Now for people who think God doesn't listen... he does. Sure enough, I found the perfect person in my youth-group for me. Smart, funny, we had almost everything in common. The only disadvantage was she had a boyfriend at the time.  Well, for some reasons, many including the boyfriend was kinda a depressed person (I don't really know the details for reasons which will be explained). To me this was a total victory, now if only I could just sway her a bit... Ah-ha I thought! If I took her to my homecoming she'll surely fall in the deep undeniable love with me that I had with her. Well, as it turned out she went with me and... nothing happened. Well a few weeks later I start to talk to her and ask her some menial issues, and she just kinda shut me out. I have no idea what I had done. She wouldn't really talk to me at all. She seemed so depressed, and thinking she was a great friend I tried to comfort her. Unfortunatly, she just wouldn't have it.  So as you all can see my life has had many relationship flaws from time to time. Alas, nothing can hold me down, as mentioned earlier I have a never dying happiness. Unfortunately I would be slightly happier if I had someone in my life who I could share my happieness with...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Can't Nobody Hold me Down!!! - 12/12/2001  &nbsp;  Well now that I've finished the Mack Saga I can start talking about my current life.  I'm 14, I live in Houston, Texas, I'm in to rap, girls, IM (Btsunami2001), and all that other mess. I guess I'm pretty funny and like to chat alot.  g2g so if anyone wants to chat:  Holla back!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Finals... Arrrrrrrrgh!!! - 12/14/2001  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ah I cannot stand finals. Though this is my first year to take them, I am utterly overwhelmed by them. It doesn't help having some really mean teachers who give unquestionably hard exams. I had to do like six differnt projects today and am very stressed out.  I know this one girl who is all like, "Hey you are looking at a girls body... don't you care at all about personality... you stupid pig!" Now if thats all I did I could understand that argument, but that garden tool has had a boyfriend for about a year now and is giveing herself off to half the guys she knows (excluding me thankfully) and she and her boyfriend knock boots everytime they get a chance. All I said was that I could not go out wit' a girl that took no care of her physical apperence. I don't care how smart, friendly and funny you are, you've gotta take care of your body. Brilliance does not mean you have to throw your apperance away. I mean come on, I wouldn't expect a girl to go out wit me if I didn't bath comb my hair or trim my nails, I should think that girls should have to at least be cleanly and shave. Only exception: A mortal sin against your religion.(Which I know of no religions that have that, but why bother relying on me I'm an ignorant pig)j/k. Well aside from the village bicycle on my bus, today was fine. Not much going down, I'm still having relationship problems with my youth-group girl, but ah well, not my whole life.  Peace, love, and victory  HOLLA  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Still Dre - 12/19/2001  &nbsp;  Today I found out that my closest friend, indeed hates me with a passion. I was crushed, I thought that I could tell her everything. Alas, my life is still great, I'm having fun and that's all that matters.  Finals will soon be over and I will enter two weeks of bliss. Ah the Christmas holiday... goofing off, sleeping in, ah how miss thy blissful times. Well to all of ya'll who be hatin' on me I don't really care cause when Christmas roll's down, I'm still Bryan... and no one can take that from me.  Peace, Holla,  Bryan Mack  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  You can hate me now... - 12/19/2001  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "...But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now."  This is just a shout-out to all ya'll playa's who be hating on me... you know who you are! Like I said, you can hate on me now, but I dont give a $#@* cause nuthin' you can say will bring me down or stop me from what I do.  Hey Megan, yo in the hall you said thanks for something? Sorry, I was a bit messed up at the time. Well thats all I gotta say for right now.  Peace, (except for all you hatin' on me now)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Victory! - 12/21/2001  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Finals are over, I have triumphed over that which has all but killed me... now for the next two weeks I'll be sitting on my a$$ and watchin' TV... the good life.  Well my finals were really hard but wit' a small bit of studying and goofing off I pulled them all off pretty good. I know that I got an 89 in english and bio. so I'm pretty happy about that.  Well now that I've told a bit about myself I guess I'll describe myself.  Height: 5'7''  Weight: Hopefully 150 lbs.  Dark thick brown hair.  Medium build, and thats about it.  HOLLA  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls - 1/9/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Man, I've been so confused. I gave up on that youth group chick... heck I'm gonna stop goin' to that youth group period, but not cause of her. There be this famliy there, and every-single one of them make me wanna go on a killing spree.  Bad thing going down now is that all my playa's (You know who you are) think I'm just some guy who's in it for the physical... that just aint true at all. I'm very concerned with personality, unless the girl is like REALLY, REALLY ugly I would like her.  I kinda like three girls right now:  the first, I don't know her last name and I haven't actually spoken to her.  the second, I don't know her last name and don't go to her school, but on the plus side she really likes me  and the final one, well lets just say I'm not in her favor.  Anywayz,  Peace, Holla, Gettin' Your game on  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Lets get it... - 1/10/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Make this money, take this money, aint no way you can take this from me, aint s*** funni, shake it honey, take this money; now lets get it" G-Dep, lets get it  Shout outz...  This is for my playaz who've been wit' me long as I can remember...  Glenn ya crazy foo' keep pimp'n, Johnny you just need to go clubbin' some time, Ryan we need to work on you a bit.  For those I met few years back...  Nathan you got some issues boy, Jake... wonder ho powers... activate!!!, Meagan's wow there are like too many Meagans I know, Macy and Lauren go pimpin' with me sometime alright, Shannon and all the smarties' you're giving me some competition... stopit, Guardbabe you're a sweety holla! hehe, Christian you've got the son of God for a bro. thats cool.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Changes - 2/26/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  First lemme make a few shout outz, Sheena, don' feel hated on; like tupac shakur said shortly before his death,"...buried as a G while teh whole world remembers me, until the end of time..." i will be ur hommie until  the end of time.  Nathan, you have now made it to king pimp, one, two, three, four, five... just kidding, you know that will always be my job... hahahahahaha!  BTW, don' none of ya'll be hating..."Really? get smacked silly, you get smacked silly, F***ing with these N*****..." G. Dep-Lets get it  A revalation which has just recently occered to me  :  Everyone in the THS band or guard are obsessive and exclusive people who are probably the worst part of our school. Now Glenn, johnny, vann and ne i missed, this don' mean u so stop ur biznitching.  As mentioned earlier... rap keeps me alive... it is probably my life force, it inspires me to become great and has lead me to a state of near mental balance (don't leave a note bout that nate, k? lol)  Alright, well G2G ya'll, Peace, Holla, and straight pimpin on wax... nuffin else matta's  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm an school anthropologist... - 2/26/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ...that of course is provided they deal with studying the formation of social structures...  Being the overanalytical person that i naturally am i have mapped out the entire nerd clique at THS by tribe   Ekyd Group:  Two members inhabit this group, Kassie and Erica  They stay together because of their common hate for men and resentment to physical apperance. Also, they happen to be oversensative which makes them cling together in a host like way.  Central Nerds:  3-4 Memebers; Shannon, Nathan, Ben on occasion, and I. All of us tend to sling sexual jokes off at each other and have a lot of fun, cept when we make fun of ben, lol. Also are rather thick skinned and except for me are extreamly smart...  Kob and his followers:  7+ members, Kob is Jake and his lil' sub clique thingy goes down in that group, I really have no idea what holds this group together other than that they friends with jake and taht mess... very mystirous   Uncommons:  2 members, Emmit and Austin, they really arent nerds but they sort of hang aroudn with us... very strange.  1/2band nerds:  2 members, they are sort of band nerds but do not really stay in the band hall thus not making them zealous band nerds.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Diary to a Mack Part 4... - 2/27/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  alright i said part three was the last but as u can see... it isnt...lol  PART 4... Playa Hata:  Alright as you know bout my g/f who broke up me on my birth-day was a band nerd...(worst peeps alive)And also like i've pointed out frequently I am a very forgiving and overly friendly person... so as you can imagine i forgave HO-BAT  I always talked to her bout shmit over teh summer, things were great and we were kickin it. we get back to school and so we be chattin and her and her all of a sudden like week into school she figuretively bish-slaps me... I'm like WTF HO-BAT, I forgave your a$$ and your all ridin me, so i basically stopped callin her right. Ahh but the pure treachory and that mess for band-nerds  did not end there, I sort of met this girl whom i'm gonna call guardbabe05  by accident, i'd go into the details but i don wanna blow my storage quota on one entry... but newayz, we met and i was tellin her my girl trubles on day so she goes, hey i'll hook u up wit this friend of mine. Being reluctant at first  i finally said, k wuteva. So i called this girl  and was kinda givin her the scoop on my classes and shmit. Durign this time i told her how i STRONGLY dislike my art teach and wished for her to... lets just say stop blinking for an excess of time. So GUARDBABE05's b/f, who is a hrny bstrd, was all like yo bryan, don say tat mess to a girl. Ok i know he has a g/f and i don but lets see he's a junior and GUARDBABE05, is a fish, comon he cant have that much game. it wud be like me goin out wit a 7th grader... ewwww... back on track... so i call up GUARDBABE05's friend again and am gonna pologize for slingin that crap and when she picks up the phone she's all like... um yeah, GUARDBABE05's friend is um, in the shower...  Quick synopsis for those who look at notes first: Forgave, got bishslapped, accidently met h0, chatted wit h0's friend, got jail R*****   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Prolouge to a Mack Part 5... - 3/1/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Part 5, coming to terms:  Ya know people be saying how i need to hop up off the band nerds... I say F*** that S***, if i wanna throw flames i muthaf****** will and who ever is a ho a$$ enough to try and stop me can suck my MuthaF****** D***, but thats not the important thing...  The important thing is that last year i was all up in the school trying to fit into a certian clique: I wanted to be wit tha nerds but if we'd be talking about gaming or sumthin like taht and a prep walked by i'd get embarrased and stop talking... i wanted to be accepted by the band nerds last year too (blough, worst mistake of life... worst people concocted by God  ) but they cud only talk wit me for about ten mins a day so that went poorly... then i went to my youth group and i sort of lost my sense of embarrasment right... that was the best thing that could have happened to me. I now accept i'm one of the biggest nerds in the school... i goof on AIM for most of the day, play RPGs a lot and chat about computer S*** all day wit my peeps. The only thing i'm prouder to be other than a nerd is a Catholic  but still, ever since i realized that I WAS a nerd i became happier and happier,   NTM, I'm also gettin along a lot better with my playas from last year, and since most of us have open diaries its easy for us to chat alot. I'm really good friends with nathan the pimp-in-training, Jake who hates his Kob clan  and Shannon/sheena who are the smartest girls in the school  , it really amazed/humbled how i kick it wit all the smartasses of our class.  Quick synopsis: Once wanted to be a dumbshit band nerd, now i'm a nerd... NERDS ARE THE COOLEST PEEPS ALIVE, PREPS ARE ARROGANT, GOTHS SCARE THE F*** OUT OF ME, BANGERS CUT THEMSELVES  , PUNKS TRY TO BE NON-CONFORMISTS BUT BY DOING THAT THEY ARE CONFORMING TO THEIR OWN NON-CONFORMITY, AND BAND NERDS COMBINE ALL OF THOSE S**** TRAITS IN ONE CLIQUE... I'M TOO ANALYTICAL FOR MY OWN GOOD, WHY AM I WRITING IN CAP LOCK???, HOLLA BACK  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Changes... um some more i guess - 3/10/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "that's just the way it is... things will never be the same... that's just the way it is..."  People be asking why I won't delete those lovely messages I get from whomever... BTW, the crazy ho-rat Amanda who left me the last note can suck my fat C***. Neway, the moral of this story is... this is my opendiary... i'm glad if people leave me notes, even if they are threatning of my life, so on and so forth. I'm not gonna delete them just cause someone put something mean on my S***. So all the peeps that be deleting my S***, grow up, its an open diary... notes are for everyone to put... you put ur s*** on my diary and i'll do the same to you... Reason i have an all note function is fo' my hommies Nate/Jake, not for cowards who wanna be unsigned so i can't find their ods. I'll keep leaving notes on band nerds' s***. BTW... to all ya'll hating on me, cris, band nerds, that mess...  "I aint trippin' i'm a playa, i aint sweatin him, I sex his sister and had her screaming like a mexican, with no remorse it was meant to happen; 'sides rappin only thing good i did was scrappin'; until the end of time." 2pac shakur, until the end of time  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Gin and Juice... - 3/11/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "...sippin' on gin and juice; laid back, with my mind on money and money on my mind..."  Reason for this title was... well my ex-friend's name is Cris which reminded me of crystal, a type of champaign frequently mentioned in rap, which then reminded me of the song Gin and Juice by Snoop Dog. I dunno, my mind wanders. neway this is bout her.  Timeline of my friendship wit her...  Begining of school: thought i was hot  we talked alot. was told she wanted to go out wit me, because she was a junior i thought that was just a joke...  month or two into skool: Started going out with this one guy. Didn't think much of him because of his rep. never actually saw him yet though. became friends instead of love interests... note: this girl is very hot.  Two or three months into skool: talked to her openly bout michelle, luv interest at time and currently... we chatted frequently and were good friends  Just before christmas break: recieved an awful, awful letter from her tellin me to back the f*** off and saying i shudnt go after michelle. now i was thinking that its okay for her to F*** her b/f every week  but its not ok for me to luv a girl.  Newayz the moral of that story is... one ho is better than two??? well actually that had nuffin to do with that but oh well, that's not the important thing.  Um, neway  if u read this Cris... suck my D*** u fat ho.  and if u read this Shell: I still sorta luv u... despite ur lack of emotional involment with me...  (michelle is really really hot... ask nathan.)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  j'adore michelle... - 3/12/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That isnt a rap song either but... eh F*** it.  Loosly translated in french that means "I love michelle"  Well if you don't know then don't bother thinking about it and if so here's tha deal.  Ya know I'm always trying to ask her stuff but she like never says nuffin to me, still i am drawn to her. I've got the damndest feeling that even if we were to go out that it would fail horribly leaving our friendship a smoking crater  see, she views high-school relationships as "practice" for future ones. Ah, if only she knew how i felt... for the love of God no one tell her... wait, no one who reads this crap knows her newayz... haha, the beauty of my plan...   Funny story; Spring break, monday, five or so days before end of break... 8 page minimum paper, business presentation, French scrapbook, biology report; all of that is due in about five days... ARRGH!!! who told me high skool was gonna be a bish...? well everyone but ah well, its my own damn fault for being a procrastinating dumb $***  Newayz,  Peace, luv, HATING ON S***Y A$$ BAND FAGS; nuffin else matters.  HOLLA  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Until the End of Time Part 1 - 3/13/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Guess what band nerds??? I can hate on you all I want... I'll still be me... Until the end of time...  &nbsp;  Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side  Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die  And even though we both came from the same places  The money and the fame made us all change places  How could it be - through the misery that came to pass  The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask - for currency  But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave  Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see  It's a small thang to a true, what could I do?  Real homies help you get through  And come to know he'd do the same thang if he could  'Cos in the hood true homies make you feel good  And half the times we be actin' up call the cops  Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block  It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change  I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time  Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin  My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids  So you know, I don't hang around the house much  This all night, money making got me outta touch, shit  Ain't flashed a smile in a long while  An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs  My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo  Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo  For quiet times disappear, listen to the ocean  Smokin 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'  Who can I trust in this cold world?  My phony homey had a baby by my old girl  But I ain't trippin' I'm a player I ain't sweatin' him  I sex his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican  His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen  Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time  Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?  To live my life as an Outlaw all along  Remain strong in this planet full of player haters  They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators  And in the end drinkin' Heneessy made all my enemies envy me  So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily  Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath  While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)  What I can see closer to achieve  In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G  Follow my lead I'll supply everything you need  An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G  Remember me, as an outcast Outlaw  Another album out, that's what I'm about, more  Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket  Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Coming to Terms... - 3/17/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yes I'm also well aware that this title was not rap related at all... but  who cares, no one who reads my $hit likes rap anyway.  I have learned over the years that you can have all the friends in teh world, but if none of them like you, it makes no difference... instead, if you have at least 1 good friend, than it is unquestionablly better than one  thousand fake ones. Reason for me saying that is for two reasons. For the past 6 years of my life I was trying to follow the Preppy crowd... not really understanding where my ambitions lay or who I wanted to be with. I thank God that I have finally realized what I truly am: a nerd. I talk on AIM frequently and talk to my friends about games... and now that I have finally accepted and been open about this I have never been happier.  The second reason is because I do have a few truly good friends. What we all have in common is that we all wear masks. Though Nate appears a cold-hearted conservative to many people, I have had the chance to get to know him better and he is truly a fun loving person who... well he's still a conservative but, eh... Jake also seems distant many times. He will give you the impression that he is a jock and despises the ground everyone else walks on. Jake on the other hand is a very passionate person with a sense of humbleness that it is astonding. Then we have Shannon, upon hearing that she is the smartest person in the school you would think that she is arrogant and has no life. She is none of these, Shannon is witty, slightly insane, and humble for her  abilities.  I consider these three to be my true friends   We all have something in common and for the first time in my life I feel that I'm on the same frequency as someone else.  But the moral of this story is... if you're a playa with thousands of ho's and their all ugly... you're not really a playa, but if you only gots a few hot a$$ b****s then you're the best playa round... This is for my hot a$$ b****s,  HOLLA my pimps and pimpettes!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don't believe in psychics but... - 3/18/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  At this time you are feeling 'uptight' and you are urgently in need of rest and relaxation; but perhaps even more than that you need to overcome that feeling that you have been 'hard done by' and treated with a complete lack of consideration. Maybe you have, but whatever may have been the cause of your inherent anxiety, you regard the situation as intolerable. Your are, however, sufficiently competent to turn that situation around - you have overcome similar problems in the past, and really this one isn't too different.  You are looking for something different. Your imagination has been working overtime and you are seeking adventure - and you'd like to share that adventure, the new experience, with someone like yourself: Imaginative, Enthusiastic and Sensitive.  You feel truly deprived - not getting your fair share, but you have accepted the fact that that is the way things are at this time and that it is prudent to let matters slide and not hit your head against the wall -so conform and agree for a while. Accept the situation - nothing can last forever.  There is considerable amount of stress present in your life at this time and this is perhaps due to some considerable mental and physical frustration. There are various physical needs that are necessary for your well-being but whatever the reasons - mostly of your own making - your needs are not being fulfilled. We wonder why? You are under the impression that nobody seems to care for you. This predicament is most uncomfortable and it is because of this that you are experiencing far more stress than you feel you can cope with. You need to find a soul mate - someone who truly understands you and whose standards are as high as your own. As matters stand you would like to break away from the vicious cycle that you find yourself entrapped but this is easier said than done. You refuse to compromise with your opinions and essentially you are unable to resolve the situation because you are continually postponing the making of the necessary decision. You are stubborn but this should be no deterrent experiencing a happy life.  You are completely worn out and you are not in the mood for any further demands on your resources. The situation - such as it is - has rendered you quite helpless, unable to continue the mental battle that you have been pursuing for some considerable time. Enough is enough. All you would like to do now would be to have some time for yourself, to find a peaceful situation where you can recuperate in your own time.  ...I was just stunned when I read this... I always try to analyze myself... understand who I am... for the most part this summed it up... www.colorgenetics.com  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Bad Intentions... - 3/19/2002  &nbsp;  "I don't care for F***ers, I'm just drinking, smoking straight west coasting, B****s put your A$$ in motion, P**** poppin sex on lotion, raise it up... blaze it up... all these n**s, I dont give a F***. All i really know is that yo ho wants you to be with me, she aint playin', what i'm sayin'..." Doc Dre ft. Nock'Turn'Al, bad intentions...  Here's my average day... wake up at 6 and get my clean on, ride the lorenzo sportin' bus 2 skool, kick it with my pimps an' playa's, roll on down to trick a$$ Evan's or Moore-head, hop up an' on the bus 'gain, get my sleep on, wake up at six and dine and gin and juice, holla at my hommies again, listen to some tunes and think my thoughts til three, then hit tha muthaf***ing sac..  Translated: wake up at six and shower  , ride the bus to skool, hang out with my friends before skool starts, go to one of my least fav. classes, get back home and sleep till 6, eat dinner and goof off on AIM, then i goof off and listen to rap till 3 in the morning and wake up again.  the moral of this story is: if you smoke marijuana next to a russian nuclear silo, you're bound to end up destroying the entire universe...   Holla back my pimps and playas...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Gin and Juice... Da Remix... - 3/21/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Alright i'm well aware that gin and juice was not remixed... as far as im concerened...  Well, reason fo' writing this is cuz i need to update "Gin and Juice" see the moral of thsi story is... Cris really didnt hate me, just her b/f did... haha... so me and her are cool now cuz we were like such great friends it wasnt even funni, we only incoded about 2% of our convo. nathan... haha.  But here's wtf's been going down recently... I am the happiest mutherf***er in the whole world. I got good friends, kazaa, a kick A$$ bro, life be good...  Hit me back my W****z  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Severing Ties... - 3/24/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "you aint neva seen a N**** like me, never in yo' life; and that's what you can't understand" You can hate me now-P.D.  all of my playas been asking y i don' go after that shell girl... here's my reason... i have decided that it is simply a waste of my efforts and resources to persue this girl. She simply does not talk to me about anything of interest/seriousness, we go2 dif. skools which makes it hard, and she's a crazy ho... end of story...  also, to those of you who have heard my legacy of POP (my church) this will make more sense, if not than ask. Anyway, the moral behind this story is that I shall no longer support POP's youth group and simply continue as a regular catholic.  ah hell w/ it, i've got plenty of time...  THE LEGACY OF POP... dun, dun, dun...  I came to POP's youth ministry by chance; I should have been up at Washington state w/ my northern homies pickin' strawberries and makin' money... instead i stayed home and went to youth group... I was changed from a cold hearted indivig' to a loving and open person... the people there were so nice... especially the seniors... they all made me feel at home... welcome... I finally was able to be myself... or who I thought I was at the time... then skool rolled on in and as I walked into skool for the first time for three months, i sensed a forign, almost evil presence... From POP I learned to make fun of myself instead of others (its sooo much easier, think, if you're trying to come up w/ an insult you have to sit there and think and think... instead i just added on to their dis... and that got whoever to shut up)... As skool started i felt like everyone there was evil, blasphemers... i would constantly look down on people and mentally acuse them of being un-christian, hypocrits... then as I would go back to POP youth to sort of "power up" my happiness... when i looked at my youth group a second time I noticed that something happened... the friendly enviorment had been tainted by two main sources... one of which being the "Oil" family... and the second spawned from the Oils... let me just lable these as the "Shawn Kara Stones"... well Shawn Kara whom had a high influence on my skool's peeps and $hit decided to flock his friends to the youth group... by that time I had realized that I was in fact a nerd and decided to lable out the entire clique system in my skool (i've got an actual gif. map if neone wants to see it... u've already seen it Squalhan)... and from that I had come to the realization that Preps are arrogant, stuck up fools... and Shawn Kara brought such people to POP... within a matter of weeks the entire system fell to the ground and died... no longer was my church a happy place to be... it had been infested by swarms of dark preps... I could no longer be happy there... Luckily I had found my tru playas at skool by then... I am very lucky to have been in POP when I was... it showed me who I truly am...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Selective Hearing... - 3/30/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've got one thing to say 'bout all ya'll pissin on me... HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA!!! You think that your words can hurt me??? You're talking to me... ya know what? so what if i write like i'm black... You can all kiss my W*gga a$$. Just cause I don't act like some stuck up band F***er who could easily burrow a holein their fat a$$ b/f and live inside of him don't mean nuffin' i don' act white. My life is better than ya'lls cud ever be... I KNOW MY FRIENDS, MY FRIENDS ARE KICK A$$, THEY RNT IN BAND... exculding van, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M NOT TRYING TO EMULATE SOMEONE... SO THE REST OF YA'LL CAN GET ON YO' KNEES AND SUCK MY D***  hit me back playas!!!  FYI... LEARN TO F***ING LEAVE A SIGNED NOTE COWARDS!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Is this the end??? - 4/1/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "momma told me one day it would happen, but she never told me when; she told me it would happen when I was much older, wish it would have happened then (is this the end?)"  Here's wuts been on my mind recently...  Is life really worth living? I mean if this life is hell, logic would suggest that dying on earth would send you to either heaven or cause your conciousness to disipate... if your family betrays you, you anticipate failiure in life and death within at most a decade, you have a knack for harming all around you, and your lovelife is biting u in the gonads is life really worth living??? Not talking about suicide of course, its just... well i... i dont know, i just dont feel too good, lol. But none of ya'll shud feel bad for me... I have reached a state of mental clarity... hmmm, very strange. Haha, i know ya'll think i'm f***ed up but when have i ever cared... that's why i'm so proud to be me... cause i am me... Holla back foo's  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Death, Remorse, Rebirth - 4/10/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Death...  Shannon once said, "Bryan if you keep saying this S*** it will come back at you." Natuarally I laughed it off and kept on making rude and uncalled for jokes not thinking of the consequences. One day I said something which, unknown to me, horribly effected a good friend of mine... when I heard what it did to her I couldn't believe it...  Remorse...  When I found out why it upset her so much I was sick with myself. I stepped out of my body and looked what i had become. i was a mean and hateful indivig'. The weekend after what I did, my parents, brother and I got in a large fight which I guess was my pennance. What i did to her was inexcusable and can only pray will be forgiven. Still, days after I found out I was still bitter and cold, even my best friends couldnt reach me. I realized a change was needed.  Rebirth...  I'm now trying to reconcil my sins with her adn others. haha, i comb my hair now too.  but the moral of the story is: if u do bad S***, it'll come back adn bite ur ballz off  other than that, peace love and pimpin'... nuffin else mata's... holla  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  One Mic... - 4/23/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage One ni**a front, my face on the front page Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib One God to show me how to do things his son did Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin s*** Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages  Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken  Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in Blackin out as I shoot back, f**k gettin hit!" Nas, One Mic  Here's a funni story those close to me should enjoy:  -Alright, there's this guy rite?  -He was thinkin', "ya know what? there's something missin' in my life. I need to hook up w/ someone.  -this guy did a lot of thinkin bout who he'd agsk out. he took the time to elmininate the fat, ugly, manish, annoying and emotionless people.  -so finally he found this one girl... this guy did some more thinkin'  -"Hmm... the last reltionships i'd been in i rushed in adn got screwed over rite? Lets try a dif. approach this time", thought the guy.  -"maybe if i got to know her and didnt force nething, stuff wud turn out better"  -so the guy waited and waited... boring... til that girl got curious as to who the guy was mackin' on.  -the guy was wise though and didnt tell her cause he didnt think the time was rite  -during the time the guy waited he noticed she really wasnt the person he wanted  -finally the girl hounded the guy enough he had to tell her  -"i really don' know if i like you nemore..." the guy said to her.  -the girl using all of her wisdom decided to ignor/avoid the guy in order to piss him off  -keep in mind that until the guy told that girl how he felt they were good friends... but the girl thought that they cudnt be friends nemore after he said taht.  -so had the guy kept his d*** mouf shut they'd still be buds  &nbsp;  Tell me what ya'll think of that!!!

Well here's wuts been going down for the last... well since i last wrote:   As i've said before; "Life's a b*tch, drink it up"... sadly, to this day I have no idea what that means. but i'm guessing its that no matter how much S*it goes down you've got to suck it up and get on w/ it. Well, its official, I've learned that when i tell myself my life is going well or that i'm good friends w/ sum1 i get screwed over somehow.  Now, there are many perfect examples of this but i'll just put in the few that recently occured:  1.Before: Hey, nate's a good friend, i really understand him and vise versa  After: Uh... well I"m still working that one out, some bad S*it is still going down, i dont know wut... hey, i'm still in the dark... haha.  2.Before: YOUTH GROUP IS AWSOME AND EVERYONE THERE IS COOL.  After: youth group sucks and i despise all who go there.  3:before: my parents and brother understand and really love me.  After: Well they think i'm some freak because i dont try to put myself on some pedistal above everyone else like they do and therefore treat me like dog S*it.  Well that concludes the three main things that are on my, I'm pissed off for the following reasons list. Now on to more pressing matters, (i talk like a complete idiot for one)  Hmm, I know ya'll(regarding all who actually read this crap) think that i'm only 15 and taht i should have absolutly no idea what i should do w/ my life... but i am iggnorant as always (just ask nate, he'll agree) to that and want to plan my entire life out.  I am really pissed off because three of my 3 life ambitions I'm going to have to decide one to pursue... sadly none of them are respected by my family members much less understood.  -Business dude: I duno, i just always loved my intro to buz class in 7th grade and would love to be in a suit w/ a bunch of other guys debating whether or not to buy or sell, (for some damned off reason that just appeals to me)  -Anthropologizer: (yes, i'm aware that is not a real word) as most of you know i love analyzing things, especially things w/ no relavence to real life. teh main con is that i'd have to actually do "work" and as Mr. Ego mentioned, no airconditioning.  -Gaming Dude: I LOVE GAMING!!! and i love making games all the more, but in order to really be a famous one i'd have to start my own business and all that BS, but still it appeals to me. Unfortunatly no one in my family thinks thats a good idea cuz they think comp. sci. is some witch craft BS.  In conclusion... life blows... end of story, but the moral of this story is... don't drink and drive.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  To Kob... - 7/22/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  DUUUUUDE ITS SOO LATE!!! Yeah, but newayz.  I'm writing this because Kob has blocked EVERY SINGLE ONE of my screen names. (you gotta give him props for that, it took him like an hour.. haha) Here's what went down that fateful day (or evening, morning or any other part of the day it happened.);  Squalhan had this conversion rite,(i hope few peeps know who that is, o well) and despite my analasis of his personality he still believes that he will forever remain "saint paul the second". At the time it was really buggin' the shi* outa me so I asked a few of his friends what they thought about this sudden change in beliefs (dont get me wrong, he was Christian before but... well he's obsessive now). Kob happened to be one of the people i was inquioring about this issue. I said to him, "don't you think nathan will stop being so preachy?"(well that was roughly it) and he replyed (also rougly quoted) "yeah, he will become less active about it) So I was talking to Squalhan about him and his... evangilizing and the issue that people aggreeded w/ me that he would eventually change and I mentioned Kob was one of them. (now understand that in Squalhan's eyes, to change at all from that personality would be to "fail" somehow... i never got that) K, so Squalhan and Kob are good friends and some crazy person said, well if Kob thinks you're gonna fail u shouldn't be as good friends w/ him or at all. So Squalhan told Kob this and... well apparetnly there was some miscomunication on all three of our parts.  Kob: Thought he would change his personality somehow  Me: Told Squalhan that he would stop evangilzing  Squalhan: Though Kob was out to make him fail thus ending their friendship.  Ending note... if any of you who actually reads this crap and knows who either of them are please tell them to read this... as I've said, Kob blocked ALL 32 OF MY SN's ARRGH!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Emotions... - 8/21/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yeah, i've been trying to kill them off for the last year. They've brought me nothing but dispare. So I now only have 2 emotions. Bliss and rage. As the Count of Monte Cristo once said, "one cannot feel ultimate bliss if he has not felt ultimate dispare". So unfortunatly I can no longer feel ultimate bliss or ultimate dispare... well i'm sure i could feel ultimate dispare but I choose not to. Eh, rambling is good for the mind, I reccomend it. Friends stray, cliques disapate, but my mind shall always remain unchanged. Eh... and for this very reason is the cause of my turmoil. I bi+ch to da** much. I wish I could just talk to myself. I'm sure i'd have a great time.. heck i would get all of my jokes. Heh :-).  What is the meaning of life? to better yourself or those around you? Perhaps niether. Perhaps life is simply a trail before your last breath... what does it all matter thou? If you only worry about death then you can't worry about life, which defeats the purpose of worrying when you die, because you never really lived. I am now wondering how I became such a hating person. My parents, life, friends, or was it simply a path I chose to take?  I've also become to dam* analytical. This causes me to find flaws in everyone, also a reason why i can't be content. The irony of this all is that thou i can usually tell why someone duz something or acts a certain way I never learned to figure out myself. I guess I am the ultimate riddle, what am i... and why.  ~Roac Wind~  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Empty... - 9/8/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That's all that I have left. My friends have left me abandonded, my parents just don't get my personality, laurel doesnt get the concept of homecoming (explained further down) and I don't understand love.  Over the summer my friends and I grew an unbreakable bond. When school started it broke, shannon decided i was a lazy F*** and nate fails to realize that I am bryan and always have been. plus i cant figure out whether or not cailyn hates me or not. I'm so alone...  I'm a god D*** nerd. my parents need to get over it, I am more comfotable in front of my computer screens than in front of them. They dont get anything about me, or wut i'm like. I'm so alone...  I met this great girl, asked her to homecoming (a ninety dollar investmetn) and she basically says she's gonna hang out w/ a group of freshman the whole time (which includes dancing w/ all of them. That is total bullshi*, if i'm gonna fork out a near hundred on a dam* nite ur practically my whore, so u damn well best act like it. (shell was the acception, i was working up to asking her out) I'm so alone...  The girl i was gonna go 2 homecoming w/ is awsome, we agree completely, but becuz i'm a sophmore i get the feeling she sees me as a superior and not equal... I dont want her to agree w/ me cuz i'm older, i want debate, argument, I dont want a slave (lest i spend 90 dollars on her lol) I'm so alone...  I need help, a friend.. something, please tell me you hear my cries...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  on a less biatchy note... - 9/8/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Visit my site... it has my story on it and i'll be posting all my diary entries on it soon too. enjoy  http://www22.brinkster.com/nezro/rwproductions/base.htm  email me...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Love... - 9/15/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  For many years now I have been trying to find it. Though I thought I was in love several times they proved to be flawed. Nothing more than a self-created illusion to hide me from truth... taht I am indeed alone. I suppose taht I choose to be alone. Or is it that don't know what love is... perhaps I shall never know.  Michelle was my "first love". She was beautiful, I thought we were alike in every way. Aside from the simple fact that she had absolutly no feeling for me.  I guess I loved Cris as far as my idea of love goes. She bore similar feelings for me, but her boyfriend drove us apart (in more ways than one)  A year later... I thought perhaps I was on the brink of falling for Laurel, but as I tried to fawn Michelle by taking her to homecoming, Laurel proved that our mindsets on relationships are different. Perhaps my mentality is greedy, I want Laurel to be mine and mine alone, however she wishes to share a tight "friendship" with other guys... and w/ my past experiences w/ men in my g/f's relationships (diary of a mack part 1) that scares me... perhaps my last few emotions clinging on. Not to mention she constantly speaks of how other guys are cooing over her, and being the passive Xy (major inside joke) person that I am, I can do nothing about it. So is this God telling me that I am doomed to live my life alone... empty... w/o love? Or is this my primary challenge in life, to break my curse, and be loved?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Dying on the inside... - 10/11/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, looking back on this diary I've noticed a sort of rhythm to my entries. I go from being in a state of total bliss, for instance when I was in youth group. To a state of anger and depression. But for the time being I haven't slipped outa that phase of depression. I can't honostly say who my true friends are anymore. I once thought the nerd clique was inclusive and friendly... but recently found out they are arrogant, hateful and narrow minded. No longer do I belong to anyone or anything... I can't conform for I have found nothing of any level to conform to. I can feel myself slipping further and further away into darkness. I don't know if i'm going insane or just horribly depressed. I guess it's always been true that I could never tell what I was/am thinking.  Im no longer as articulate or strong as I once was... I am... I am, I don't know... perhaps I'm dying on the inside... but I can never show it. No one knows...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  10/17/02 - 10/17/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Externally, Bryan is a very happy person full of energy and life. Willing go above and beyond to get a laugh outa someone.  Internally, my life sucks, friends have been treachorous (not all), my lovelife shall never get better... much less exist and lastly as i mentioned before, I'm slowly dying on the inside... life is fading away until i shall become mentally unstable.  I suppose before I leave this place.. into a deep pain where there is no return I might as well get out a few last thoughts... I've never been good at writing down what I'm feeling until recently. I am happy at school, but I think its just a shell, I'm empty... alone... and I don't think anyone is responsible for it; yes, it is my own hands that have caused me to spiral into this dark pit of depression. When I come home and try to sum up why life is good... I come up with nothing.  Friends from last year, nathan and I have just been drifting apart since he "found Jesus", he just doesn't get me and plus I'm like so far down on his "friends to talk to list" that when i want ot talk to him, I have to wait in a line, and when I get up there i'm pushed away. And he wonders why I blocked him.  Shannon, well, as many of you know, she had a lengthy convo w/ nathan(me on his sn) that was nothing but bashing me (several pages long) and you can imagine how that affected our friendship... its gotten better. But I guess she's just tolerating me.  Ben, i guess now that we're not in PE we don't have enough time to get philosophical... or perhaps too much time. We argue on most everything now, and without fail every time he will end with "you're dumb, don't talk to me anymore"... hmm, reminds me of kevin.  Bret, the only person I can say nothing negative about, even during m darkest hour and my first falling from the clique he stayed with me (first falling was that convo w/ shannon) He has never been bitter or an asshole... and I should thank him indefinetly for that...  It doesn't help that I have several classes primarily with freshman... and quite frankly, every single one of the "nerd" freshman are arrogant bastards. Never in my experience of analyzing the sophmore nerds have i seen more arrogance, Calvin holds no ground to any of them (btw, that guy is so fickle on whetehr or not he's going to be nice to me I didn't even bother noting him in the friend list thing)  I shall leave my precious readers with this, One cannot find a brilliant mind if all they can do is call them stupid.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The end of it all... - 10/17/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Externally, Bryan is a very happy person full of energy and life. Willing go above and beyond to get a laugh outa someone.

Friends from last year, nathan and I have just been drifting apart since he "found Jesus", he just doesn't get me and plus I'm like so far down on his "friends to talk to list" that when i want ot talk to him, I have to wait in a line, and when I get up there i'm pushed away. And he wonders why I blocked him.  Shannon, well, as many of you know, she had a lengthy convo w/ nathan(me on his sn) that was nothing but bashing me (several pages long) and you can imagine how that affected our friendship... its gotten better. But I guess she's just tolerating me.  Ben, i guess now that we're not in PE we don't have enough time to get philosophical... or perhaps too much time. We argue on most everything now, and without fail every time he will end with "you're dumb, don't talk to me anymore"... hmm, reminds me of kevin.  Bret, the only person I can say nothing negative about, even during m darkest hour and my first falling from the clique he stayed with me (first falling was that convo w/ shannon) He has never been bitter or an asshole... and I should thank him indefinetly for that...  It doesn't help that I have several classes primarily with freshman... and quite frankly, every single one of the "nerd" freshman are arrogant bastards. Never in my experience of analyzing the sophmore nerds have i seen more arrogance, Calvin holds no ground to any of them (btw, that guy is so fickle on whetehr or not he's going to be nice to me I didn't even bother noting him in the friend list thing)  I shall leave my precious readers with this, One cannot find a brilliant mind if all they can do is call them stupid.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Homecoming... - 10/18/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm so damn lonely it isn't funny... this entire event is nothing more than somehting to make you feel lonely. well guess what, it's succeeded  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My wonderful parents... - 10/21/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hah, that's a load of bull$hit. As I've mentioned I can't stand stupid and ignorant people. But it's only worse if they handle money. I spent aproximately 4 hours writing a debate case the nite before and becuz my printer blows a$$ I have to keep transfering the file to print it out. As I finished both cases I put it on a disk and took it to the shit computer to print it out on and it was completely corrupted... coluldtn be opened. So I spent the next 2 hours in the nite trying to get it to work... to no prevail. Hence, I went to sleep 5:35 and work up 5:42. My case was hoss boss too, but becuz of my shit ass old computers I LOST EVERYTHING. Now this was a mistake that could have been prevented but would be EASIER BY ALL MEANS IF I JUST HAD A RELIABLE PRINTER/ COMPUTER. So i bring them teh paper that shows i have like 12 hundred in their account and tell them I'm buy a new computer. THEY WONT LET ME AND HAVE ABSOLUTLY NO REASON FOR IT. IF YOU CANT SEE WHY IM PISSED JUST TRY STAYING UP AN ENTIRE DAY, ALMOST PASSING OUT IN 3 CLASSES AND GETTING *UCKED OVER ON A GRADE CUZ UR PARENTS ARE STUPID. GAWW I HATE THEM  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  hug and a wish... - 10/23/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  A hug... That's what I could use right about now. As for my wish... I guess someone to share my life with... to be with, someone who understands me. I guess in all these years trying to rid myself of anger, hatred and cruelty I have grown weak. Am I being weak by needing someone? By wanting 2 be w/ someone? Or is that just my true self emerging. *sigh* how I desire I could understand myself better  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Counting my blessings... - 10/25/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  What I found odd was that ben actually reads my diary... and that he left a note. Initially I was like, "wtf? can't you b**** at me some other time? But i now realize that he is correct. I have been taking the " i need special treatment and am now a demi-god. I want to take some time and openly thank those I may have been an A$$hole 2.  Ben, first and formost I am sorry for not realizing my fault. I tend to do that alot if you havn't noticed. I understand that we both get personal in our debates... well every time and I suppose I should either argue w/ you less or less passionately to maintain a friendship  Shannon, she has really set me straight this year. I now realize that i had been a slacker (and still am) for the first part of the year, i'm still working on it but yeah, thanks shan.  Nate, He taught me about how greedy I am... unintentionally but I need to realize taht I'm not the center of all life, (though I wish it to be tru :) And that friends shud stick w/ each other  Bret, though I havnt biatched at him I'd just like 2 thank him for never... uh, disenting. He's been nothing but kind to me even when I was quite the oposite to him. Btw, Catholics pown major a$$ (pown is like own and... i didnt find out what hte p was for but heh, its still cool)  Moral of todays story is... uh, "Xy" haha  &nbsp;  Adiue, I bid thee good-bye - 10/30/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  As some of you know I have/had a friend who recently got into drugs. Though her personality is similar to mine as it was when I was a freshman she has chosen to handle her problems... her depression differently. I once thought to have a relationship further than friends w/ this girl. But when I heard of her drug problem my heart felt compassion and so I tried to help her. However, as I extended my hand to help this girl she did not just turn it away, but push it away. This girl has tought me that you cannot help someone who doesn't want to be helped. Wrong decisions give birth to wrong decisions and she is making one of them. Though it is sad to see a friend slip into a darkness taht even I have not crossed I cannot allow myself to be dragged any deeper into that pit.  To those of you afflicted by depression, I beg you don't turn to drugs or sex. I hate sounding preachy but it will honostly do nothing but send you into an even further depression. I'll give you the one reason I never did or will do drugs. Friends. When I was faced with the opportunity to smoke weed (which i researched heavily leaving me moderate on the subject) I wanted to try it. But when I looked back to where it matters; I suppose my friends taught me how to live. And for that I thank you dearly.  Thank-you Bret, Ben, Nathan, Shannon and Jake. You may not know it, but you have saved my life... time and time again  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Being Driven Slowly Insane... - 11/4/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why do those who don't love you cause you the most grief? That is what I've been asking myself recently. I have decided that love is over rated and is the reason that I have tried to kill my emotions. Unless you are one of the select few capable of finding someone whom you can share your life with, you find yourself tearing your hair out wondering why God chose you to be alone. So often to I try to laugh something off but deep inside my soul it burns, and it shall not stop burning until that which I have saught so long is found... Love. I have been searching for such a period of time I think my mission has blurred my vision. I havn't been able to figure out why those who look forsomething can't seem to find it, but when you don't give a damn it just pops up. That is the way I am. So often do I see people mindlessly using the term "love" and "relationship" but it means nothing to them because they needn't a journey to find it. But if I ever do find my love it will be held above all else because it is precious to me. Sadly I don't see any in the near future.  I ask again why those who don't want you cause you the most pain, and steal away your soul by constantly running through your mind. So often do I want to just run away from the idea but it is ever persistent. The hope for love hunts me down but always strikes me in the heart. This strike leaves not happiness in it's wake... but trials and anguish. What sickens me all the more is the people who do this to you and find pleasaure in it. They woo you over like a siren and most times you are too desperate to avoid the painful call, so time and time again you are wounded in the heart... wounds leave scars, scars leave pain and thus you have my life. My heart is now scarred and gushing with a terrible pain which I can only express to one person. (they may or may not know who tehy are)  Perhaps it is not just the person I vie over that scars me but myself. I too often make the illusion that there is hope, there is chance in my pursuit of happiness. But when I do try and find hope, it is snatched away, murderd by the bringer of pain, the bringer of love. How ironic those two qualitiese are held by one person. I am nieve... I am hurt.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Links in My Chain - 11/5/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, I do this every few months or so because my whole "people I'm friends w/" status changes like the weather.  Jake: Prolly the only person who understands what I'm going through right now because we have the same problem. (if you don't know what it is just look back the last five or so entries) He's hilarious and also an avid gamer (NERDS ROCK)  Nate: Meh, we've had better times but we've also had worse. Nate and I debate over anything and everything irrelatvent in thsi world. From the credibility of fan gamers to who'd win in a fight between the all mighty Sephiroth... and some weak hobbits. (guess who i'm rooting for)  Shan: I still think she hates me but "meh, wutever"  Benn: This guy has really taught me that I was/am stuck up and should try and not be... which I have for the most part. I'd also like to thank him for all the help he's been in regards to debate.  Bret: He has been nothing but nice to me (he even took me home which was completely out of his way) And I also thank him for putting up with my constnat questions about debate and such. (I'd have told myself to screw off by now if I was in his shoes)  To those of you I did not mention don't think you aren't part of my life (well, some of you aren't so stop bitchin) but these are the people whom I think have affected my personality the most and changed my mentality on several things.  +Peace  (haha, if you guess who i stole that from u get a cookie)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  For no one else but me... - 11/5/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I fail to see how greed in a relationship is bad. My view on relationships are that your g/f or b/f is someone a step up from a good friend. I want to be able to share my feelings with my girlfriend. Why is that greed not justified? A friend of mine quoted this Weezer song and though I dislike that genre of music I felt the excerpt conveyed my current view on the topic of a "relationship" (the text in quote is the song and below it i have reflections)  "I want a girl who will laugh for no one else:"  --I want my girlfriend to know I will be there for them and them alone, so they don't have to find false humor in others.  "When I'm away she puts her make-up on the shelf:"  --I want my girlfriend to be satisfied with me and me alone, so she doesn't have to flash herself off to those around her to get attention.  "When I'm away she never leaves the house:"  --I want my girlfriend to realize that I will always come back and that they shudn't need 2 go searching for me.  "I want a girl who laughs for no one else"  Am I not justified? Can someone explain why pouring all your love into someone and not recieving just return is good? My mind is a torrential fire... and I havn't the slightest idea why I continue my pursuit on "the phantom" (as I shall refer to her) if she causes me so much pain. I am Roac Wind... yet I subject myself to this pain, this futile attempt at love... why?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Reaper removes "Phantom's" veil... - 11/7/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Something that recently occured to me is that beauty is in every way in the eye of the beholder. When you love someone their beauty is exagorated one hundred fold. This also applies to mental beauty. When you get this image in your mind of someone, they in essence put a veil over your eyes making their true appereance and personality in fabricated. That's why when you either fall out of love with someone, you start noticing when their hair is sloppy, or they make rude gestures. This same theory can be applied to anger. Many times people say things that are hurting to someone. Their excuse is "ididnt mean it". I believe however, that anger purifies one's judgement. When you are angry you speak the truth.  This just seems like crappy philosophy and rambling but I have a point behind it. For too long did I let this false image of "the phantom" cloud my judgment and perception of her. I thought she was beatiful, smart, and friendly. But after she unveiled me by playing with my emotions and feelings I now see the truth. Where I once saw beauty I now see someone who has lost their faith and turned to drugs/alchohal. Where I once saw intelect, I now see she has chosen to do stupid thigns and uses poor justification for them. Lastly, where I once saw openness and friendlyness, I now see the monster of a siren that is her true form. She is insequre with her life and because of that she hides in a crowd of men and though says they are "just friends" really knows in the back of her mind they wanna bang her. She takes pleasure in this pain. She is nothing more than a fisher reeling a fish into her boat... only to throw it back when it gets too close. She asks for help but refuses to accept any. She wants to help but neglects to do so.  Though I feel a piece of me is missing because of this unveiling I know it is for the best and I need to come to terms with the fact that no woman is worth the time and energy one would have, or has put into her. According to my anaylsis she has a mental disord possilby steming from her famliy. It is the typical 360 approach on famliy life. She sees her famliy and despises them, but when she makes the same mistakes they made/make, she justifies herself, "well they did it too". In my honost opinion there is no help for her...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tournament and a Feud... - 11/12/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, this last weekend was my first debate tournament and I have 2 admit it was an assload of a fun time (I have no idea the precise amount that an assload consists of) I went 1-2 in the debate but made it to finals in Extemporaneous (im telling u, Humanities has TRAINED me to bs) As of right now I have 21 NFL points (national forensics league and need 50 to letter. I want to eventually get 250 so I can judge but meh) I hope to get fifty by next time cuz i'm most likly gonna do a few more events... and hopefully win more debates...  While the actual tourny was fun the result was less than beuno (spanish for good.. i think, i'm in german so wutever) The main reason was that Ben and I were the only one's who broke in Extempt so Bret was just waiting for us to finish so we could leave. I told them ahead of time "either ben and i had win or lose... I don't want either of us to be waiting up" cuz the thing takes aroudn a bagillion years. Well, I broke in semi's and Ben didn't which was my fear. I said "I'm pissed cuz i broke and u didn't" in the sense that I didn't want to have bret and him to wait another hour. Ben took it as being arrogant (but seriously, am i ever arrogant?) and was speaking about it behind my back in D's room. That pisses me off cuz i'm always getting ragged on by the Debate 2 guys and now i'm sure D thinks i'm some arrogant prick... meh, life sucks...  In a lighter note Ben eventually apologized for his attack. (note: this was an actual entry opposed to my philosophy for the day)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The crimson tears of abuse... - 11/18/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Freaky title huh? But it's true. No, I'm not talking about physical abuse, God has blessed me with ... "relatively" even tempered parents. I speak about the abuse of principle. Too often do I hear the word "love" used. I too am guilty of having abused this word. Using the word "love" is like sex. The more you use it the less it means. I might say "I love my girlfriend" (in the unlikely event I ever have one :)) and it is empty. People put "love" into their relationships and I honostly think "love" should be reserved for marraige (in regards to relationships) because you really dont love someone until you are willing to forfit the rest of your life to them. Understandibally I "love" some people, Cris being a prime example. Yet again, it is not the same kind of love, I love her as a friend whom I could talk to forever.  I suppose the Crow (as I will be refering to him now) is the only person who understands this. We both yearn for it, but only to see it snatched away from us. But the more painful thing I see is people who abuse the word. And figurtively, I cry crimson tears... tears with passion, tears of my blood which I have spilt trying to find the one thing out of reach... love...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My analysis... - 11/18/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  hah, I'm prolly not over her (all i need is something else to think about... haha, jenna ur awsome) but one thing that has helped me realize why she's wrong for me is pick her worthless soul apart (see, it's already working)  The phantom revealed... *dun dun dun*  First, I'd like to point out this girl has some serious brain problems. (good wording huh?) Her happiness relies on surrounding herself around boys whom want to.. err, do the nasty w/ her (haha, havnt said that in a while) Yet, like a siren, she only allows you to get so close and then treats you like shit. This is easy for the phantom because of her constant false complements and praises.  Secondly, of all of her misdeeds and mistakes she has made exp. drugs, sex, drinking, ect (haha sounds like a rapper) she attributes to her parents and friends. in my opinion, to use that excuse is bullshit. Especially the parents issue. My parents have made countless mistakes and do I say, "well gee, if they did it so should I"? Quite the opposite, life is about bettering onesself and making the world a better place to live in. I evolve, I become better than my parents.  End analysis: She marries some weak dude, fucks around and gets wasted on a weekly basis, poor dude is too weak to do nething about it, she OD's or gets raped... end  Could this entry have been any more gloom?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So alone... - 12/2/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don't know wuts wrong w/ me. I'm so depressed right now, I prolly gonna fail all my shit classes. I keep getting my hopes up high for something, but every time they come crashing down like a big pile of shit that you just can't dig your way out of. I'm trying to stay "moral" but the lonelier I get the harder it is to actualy maintain my own ethics. I love this world but I hate being in it. I'm a social being and I am disgusted seeing other ppl in a relationship simply cuz I can't be in one myself. Be it my own doing or simply no one loves me enough take that extra step w/ me. Sometimes I jsut don't see the point in existing. I know life demands trials to gain wisdom but what is wrong with ignorance? Damnit how am i to maintain my fu**ing morality when I have nothign to strive for? When I wake up I don't go "gee, today will be an awsome day." It's like, I just wake up to pass another day. I'm so fu**ing confused it's not even funny. I found myself staring at the comp screen for like an hour cuz I can't seem to find an equal, a soulmate. No one can possibly understand what that's like... so lonely, so tired... someone give me a reason to not give up...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Dumb people are... - 12/2/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ... Dumb, plane and simple, "dumb ppl are dumb". This year has been a prime example of that. I'm ranting about this specifically cuz in debate we're discusing "should cafeteria food be inspected and tested by health inspectors?" WHAT KINDA GAY CRAP IS THAT? One of the students thought it was a "serious" issue in todays modern society and so half the class voted on it. I honostly wanted to walk up to that girl and slap her. Of course its inspected. There is no  should  about it, lets play devils advocate really quick. No, I would actually enjoy having fecal matter, baby parts and other such disgusting things fuzed into my food. Even if you think that's a good idea the question is all the more stupid becuz we are REQUIRED BY LAW to inspect it. I couldnt just bring a batch of homemade cookies to school, it would be ezier to bring a gun then something homemade to THS. Son of a bitch i'm mad cuz of that. It's just so F**ing stupid. Believe you me, before we're done discussing it I will have smacked my head into the desk so many times I will have successfully dropped my IQ by ninety five points. SON OF A BITCH THIS IS GAY!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Aint what it used to be... - 12/20/2002  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Is it me or did this year just suck some major balls. I mean I can remember last year how everything went great, I was aceing most of my classes. (sigh) where did it all go? I just get the feeling a giant shit ball is hovering above earth and glaring down going "hah, I'm a giant shit ball ruining ur life" Example of last years goodness, A. I wasn't attracted to crazy whore psycho bitches, instead just a catholic crazy... B. Humanities was soo much cooler back then, we talked about poonanny half the time... C. Life currently sucks. See, those are just some of the reasons. This is primarily just a rant w/ absolutly no philosophical backing... *what a surprise* BTW, in 12 hours I'll be done with finals and taking a major nap (it being aproximately 11:52 PM CST as of right now)  Yeah, jake's coming over friday, then nathan sunday. I'm just glad they resolved all that BS. It was seriously a one week feud *poorly spelled* and last but not least. LEAVE SOME DAMN NOTES, the reasons its an open diary is so i can get some input... I want to know ppl actually read my crap *crap not meaning actual fecies but a reference to my writing* end.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Happy New Years Damnit... - 1/1/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  yep, my resolution will prolly be something like "do your homework" or "don't piss people off" or "quit your blind rage attacks". Iduno, prolly sumthing I'm just going to blow off. Nate got me IWD2 (Icewind Dale 2) and Akira for Christmas, ich bin sehr happy... well, happy isn't german to my knowlege but FUC* YOU... woahhh.. need to go to bed sooner. It's around 1:47 AM right now. Yep, sleep is needed... diablo 2 is needed more, I bid ya'll adieu.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Not to get my hopes up... - 1/7/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, I think I have found my place better this year than I had last year. Though my grades are sucking, in regards to friendships I believe I have mended any wounds and strengthened old bonds. Today Nathril actually asked me to be his lab partner. Now that may seem like nothing to you but it was very important to me. I'm usually the one in teh class who gets stuck with the four armed kid who vomits constantly... or I would have to pay my partner a considerable sum.  Another good thing is that I'm "seeing eye to eye" with most of my friends now, and it is to my understanding that I've worked past the... unpleasentness with shannon. Many things are good now (Ihave no girlfriend but that's... well... life isn't perfect haha) Though I fear writing this because as I have mentioned countless times,  when you think life is going easy and great, someone/or something finds a way to prove you wrong.  But I'd like to be able to look back and say that I was indeed once happy.  now for a bit of my philosophy...    Roac's Sub-Divine Philosophy on Life...    I am unaware what the main asperations of many people are, and I do not even know solidly what mine are. However the one thing I want is to be remembered, but more importantly to be remembered for something important. This may seem like a foolish dream because I won't be around to witness my post-humonous fame, but I would enjoy being able to great the reaper and know my legacy won't be forgotten... I don't want to fade away in history. I want nothing more than to have people tens, hundreds or even thousands of years look back and say, "hey, remember such and such about Roac?". This seems like a silly and unlikely dream but... well, you need something to hope for or else what is life worth living?  End.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well Jesus Christ I've always been a conformist.. - 1/30/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  One thing I'd like to mention is that yes, I am indeed grounded from the internet and am at school right now. I hate school  Yep, this entry is basically to complain about my love life as my other two friends Nathril and Aeryn have. I figure my main problem is I cannot be myself around a girl who I want to date. I feel like I always have to impress them and that actually raises my charisma, and I fervently hate charisma. I have never been one to hoot and holler at a sports game, nor can I scream on a rollercoaster, I've never been able to scream when I'm not angry. And so my false charisma pisses me off first because I want my girlfriend to like me for who I am and respect my personality. and secondly because I always f**k up somewhere along the line. I just try to act like some badass, but doing that just isn't me. I like being able to make fun of myself, kick myself in the dirt. I like being the one who's comic relief, I don't want to pretend I'm some hotshot because honostly, I am indeed not. So I can't act like myself around a girl I'm infatuated with, and I'm terrible at flirting, I make those crappy pickup lines like "ur daddy musta been a baker cuz u have nice buns" look good. So it has been decided that teh only possible way for me to hook up with someone is if they have been my friend for some time and suddenly go head over heals for me. And the odds fo that parallel the likely hood of a giant shit ball coming down and eating my pants right off me.  I loved Michelle, I loved Cris, I loved Laurel... one by one I singlehandedly destroyed my relationship with them. I was a complete and total idiot around Michelle, I cannot blame her for not liking me. I completely ignored Cris until she started going out with someone else and then screwed up our friendship. And I ruined my love/friendship w/ Laurel by realizing she's a F**king crazy whore b*tch. I need to find someone for me... someone that completes the puzzle which I call my mind.  Someone asked me why I wanted a girlfriend. Honostly, at that time I hadn't a good answer. But I look back to 8th grade when I was going out with Amie and I can say I was truly happy. I could call her and tell her how my day was and she could do the same. I had someone to talk to... someone to be with. Though it ended in misery I enjoyed the short time I had. someone to talk to...  I AM ROAC F**KING WIND!!! NO GOAL IS UNCONQUERABLE TO ME... and yet this task is proving more than formidable for me. Life is to short to be depressed... life is too short...    Just fade away...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Wind, Fire and Water... - 1/30/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    I am reaper of the whirlwind...   &nbsp;  I feel that I have grown closer to water, and yet further away from fire. I have never been able to find contentment with all of my life. If school is going great, family sucks, if family is great, school sucks. Water and I are near parallel on our mentalities towards life, love and gaming. Fire and I are too, but... something is amiss.    Water flows...   &nbsp;  Water is great, we can always laugh about girls (lacktherof) and talk about fantasy crap. Not to be taken the wrong way, but I feel very close to him for some reason. But the sad thing being, is that I have been a constant a$$hole to him and yet he's repaid me with nothing but kindness and a hearty laugh. My abrasive attitude causes harm, but expects friendship in return. I thank water very much for not just getting up, punching me in the face and spitting on me... which he should have done many a time. I still think his views on capital punishment and war on Iraq are stupid, never will i conceed on that point!!!    Fire burns...   &nbsp;  Fire too is very close to me, (yet again, not to be taken the wrong way) yet we constantly get in disputes. His mentality dictates it to be a total argument, while I want concession and contentment. I seem to be taking his jokes more and more personally, and I return it with a firey fist. I don't want to. Shannon set me straight, I made a critical coment and she just totally made me think, she said, "why do u always bash fire when he thinks ur great" now ifeel terrible... life is crap  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Valentines Day... - 2/13/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  $hit, I'm alone again. I can't feel it because I've been single for so da** long. But I can remember, back to the time I wasn't... I remember the good feeling that having a girlfriend brought me. If I had the power to cry I just might. I am the lone wolf. But sometimes I wish I wasn't.  &nbsp;  I got my letter jacket today so that was a plus. Hoo ah I look like a stud in it... heh, yeah. Not really but it makes me feel good on the inside. I've decided that for my birthday all I want are books, money and anime. That's all that I really enjoy anymore.  My book is coming along nicely. I am just throwing in bits and parts of my book to keep from sounding repetative. If that makes any sense. I wish nothing more than to have my book be famous. Or even be printed. I want to look back and hold my paper back book and say "this was a beautiful creation". I want to be remembered. Life is to short to be sad. Just fade... away...    Those who oppose me shall fall   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Wha ha ho... - 2/25/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  How did my diary become a center for war between people? And I can't even guess who's leaving the notes. It must be either Nate, Jake or Sheena cause they're the only people who read the diary but hmm... Just sign ur damn name sometime.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I just don't know anymore... - 4/16/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm being told that stagnation is bad, and that accepting change is a good thing. But why? If I enjoy staying in my own little group, if I enjoy having a minimal (at best) social life, than why should I be forced to change? I enjoy who I am and where I am. Heaven forbid I find a comfort zone and enjoy being there. What scares me is those around me are changing. Are going to parties, are drinking. That just is not me.  The same friend was confused when I told him I couldn't date a party girl. A girl who drinks. Why is that so hard to believe? My zone is one where I can sit down and just talk to a friend. I don't want a cup in one hand and a lighter in teh other. Quite frankly, the party setting doesn't appeal to me. Happieness comes from surrounding onesself with friends, so what good is it to surround yourself with people you dont know? I cant walk up to someone and just hit it off. A fault, I admit that but I also accept it. I wish I could become more social. But looking at what that "social" attitude foreshadows does not appeal to me. I want to be liked, but as I've always thought, the most popular person gets the most compliments, and the most insults.  Roac Wind... That is who I am. That is who I shall forever be God willing. I want to keep to my morals, to keep to my friends.   Just Fade... Just fade away...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Wind's Triforce... - 4/22/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  There are three things that bind me to this world. Well, actually more than three but these are the things which I hold closest to my heart... *tear* The reason I'm putting these down now is because Ascaril was telling me how if his current catch didn't like his music, he didn't know if he could like her. The reason being is that that is the main thing they could relate on, not video games or anything.  The triforce of Wisdom:  Fantasy, the whole concept of the dark ages fantasy facinates me. Unfortuantly I have no friends dedicated enough (save(except for) cpt. Capitalist), to play DnD with me. I love forgotten realms and one of my goals in life is to write a sucessful fantasy story. Or perhaps just make a movie on the Drizzt saga (too gory thou)  The triforce of Courage:  Gaming, why is gaming courage? I couldn't bring myself to admit that I enjoy gaming until my ninth grade year, thus it took a mound of valor to accept my lot in life. Gaming, I prolly spend to much time on it but hey, it's like any sport... except for the lack of physical involvment. Haha, someone sprained their leg playing DDR. The sad thing is, we (gamers) want gaming to become more and more realistic making the lines between reality and gaming blur. I can't wait till there is no line. I would love for there to be a game like .hack, full body interface, unfortunatly I would willingly be someone like Tsukasa.  The triforce of Power:  Anime, the greatest form of entertainment media ever. American movies have never affected me as much as a single anime has. It captures raw emotion. Hollywood simply waters down everything, "the hero always wins unscathed, peace reigns, everything is peaceful in the end". Akira is a prime example of this. The world's future was never certain, and at the end of the movie it still isnt. Escaflowne, (if you havnt seen the movie and are planning on watching it, don't read this) Lord Van and Hitomi had finally found someone, each other, it was a great love story of bonding. And after the conflict was over, after Hitomi completed her mission, she was swept away. American movies can never do that for me.  I figure that at least one of these similar passions ahs to be shared by my significant other. That is another reason why I am doubting my attraction to CB. I just dont know...    Just fade... away.........  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  5/27/03 - 5/27/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, with what my friends have been writing recently, I believe a more appropriate name for FoD would be "Fuc*ed over Diary". Meh, we all bit*h from time to time. I do it more so than others. Ironically I've been doing good for the past while, I love driving (hoo-ah), I love summer (aolrjlek) and I love kung fu fighting (hiy-yah!). Well, there is one thing that disturbs me though...    Shit that disturbes Roac (crazy music)   Aite (haha, that's some ghetto words I still have) There's this girl I like right (notice how all my stories start like that and ALWAYS have some side commentary). However, she's apparently rounded home a few times. Ya'll should know by now that I am for teh most part... unsettled at best when i know a girl who is "broken in", now as Ascaril(and everyone else) so tactfully pointed out, there really aren't any untainted girls anymore. You're either sheltered and ignorant like faith, or have been around your street a few times much like Ms Johnson. Now, putting aside that fact, my main question is, provided we do go out, am I strong enough to hold to my morals in the event she confronts me? Always optomistic and supportive, Ascaril said "no". Not that I disagree, but I would like to honostly say, yes, I stood in the face of temptation and walked away (w/o succumbing to temptation). Most fo my friends have taken the, "well I"m basically dropping my original opinions of morals on that issue", like rats fleeing from a sinking ship (not to compare them to rats). Ben is the only friend I have really who is keeping his head on (or at least acts like it). Mom asked me if I would have liked to take Roach's class last year so I could have learned more, and I simply responded no. I seriously doubt I would be as much a neo-con as I am now, or as involved with world affairs (I watch cnn at least an hour aday, my fish year I couldn't tell you what cnn was). I'm pissed off that Ben can't take concurrent b/c I would have enjoyed bitching at Lord Cackle B*tch and the rest of her Once-A-Monthly Reich (fem-nazi's).  Well @#$%...    Just fade... away...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am... Tetsuo... - 6/8/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  What did that mean? DId Tetsuo become the "new Akira" or was he simply another grain in the unfathomable power that is Akira? And what about Hitomi? I mean WTF kinda ending was that. I wanted closure, she just spirited away, never to be seen again. Did Van ever get her back, or was their whole experience together simply designed to free them of their painful lives. But one thing's for damned sure, never will she meet a guy who's cooler than a guy who has got wings, i mean how badass is that?  ... I want wings.  Yeah, I was going to take this girl out this week, but apparently some foreign object was shoved directly into her hole of eternal darkness. So suffice to say we aren't going out any time soon... or speaking for that matter. I mean what kinda shit is that? I'd go into detail but I don't really care anymore. She wasn't really my type. Didn't like gaming, didn't know what anime is, and even though she says she likes to debate, I honostly think she couldn't point to the middle east on a map of only the middle east with a title in large bold print saying  the middle east . One less thing to worry about.  Who am I? There have always been two things I've believed in my life. Death, and the fact that if you think that you're doing something innovative or saying something new, it's been done or said at least twice. Which is sadly ironic because I would like to be able to attribute that witty phrase to myself. I know that about two people on earth regularly read this, myself, and Nathril (Note: he is like the only one with an elemental name that is like his own, thus anyone can guess who it is), but at the present moment Nathril and I are having... rough times to say the least. I'd go into detail but yet again, I'll be the only one reading this, and I hope to have all this crap in 20 years.  Anyway, I love this excerpt from Cowboy Bebop... here's my take on it.    "... There once was a tiger striped cat,  this cat died a million deaths and was reborn a million times,  and was owned by various people who he didn't care for,  the cat wasn't afraid to die,  one day, the cat was reborn a free cat, a stray cat,  he met a white female cat, and the two spent their days happily together,  years passed by,  and the white cat died of old age,  the tiger-stripped cat cried a million times,  and then died,  it never came back to life...", Spike   Okay, so Spike goes through life crappily, he finally meets his woman who he loves very much, she dies, he gets pissed off and ends his life in the best ten minutes of anime I can recollect (keeping in mind my shitty memory for things that are the best). So let's put this in a timeline... better yet, let's call it the timeline of JUSTICE!!!!    THE TIMELINE OF JUSTICE   1-life is crappy and repetative  2-life is good but temporary  3-your bitch dies and then you die  See, I'm going to say I'm at about a one now...   See you later space cowboy...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Giving credit where credit is not due... - 6/9/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "How do you feel that you're losing your two closest friends right now?"  2 things wrong with that statement:  A. Logically, at the time that was said, they were far (jake and nate) from it.  B. I mean s*it, if you're gonna go and cry about something for a hella long time and pull a silent treatment "you no longer exist stance" why would I bother putting up w/ them?  I can distinctly recall Ben and I getting in a semi-fight. I totally bi*ched him out during algebra and i think the following afternoon he wrote me an apology email. I felt bad after doing it too him but I didn't apologize. Now did Ben stop talking to me? No, because Ben can see that I am stubbourn as shi+. I have constantly bashed Bret and he has really never done anything outrightly mean to me.  Who would I say I'm closest to this summer?  -Well shit, Ben has never done harm to me. I mean he even talked to me even when teh entire history class of fascists allied against me in a non speaking pact... or something of that nature.  -Well shit, when Bret and I go out to do something, I don't go watch him look for video games having wasted a fuc*ing half tank of gas. We go watch a movie, or go to astroworld. Nor does he decide to watch LOTR instead of going to astroworld. Bret is a great friend.  woah, that was a crappy entry, mind cloggy.. meh w/e...    "... I am a force with whom there is no recokoning.."  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well son of a bitc*... - 6/13/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yet again there a series of unsigned notes flying all around my diary and Ashley's by an unsigned person. Now initially i was under teh assumption that they were sticking up for me, and now it seems they are attacking me just as much. Now, i obviously have a few hypothosises as of to who this person is, but I shall keep those to myself for now. I request that whoever it is (being a person or persons) contact me either by my email  RoacWind@hotmail.com , or by AIM  Roac Wind . Obviously I'm not expecting whoever you are to be entirly forthcoming, however I would simply like to know who you are and what your motivation for leaving those notes is.  For a side note, for the two guys who have totally broken off of my "friendship", you seem to visit my diary enough to understand the events that have recently been transpiring.  For my final word today... well, in this diary because I will obviously fill the world with my speech and so forth:    ICH BIN DER KONIG... AUS KEINE HOSEN!!!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hail Hitler!!! - 6/20/2003  &nbsp;  That's right, despite my best efforts I am indeed under the employment of a  Quiznazi . I work at Quizno's and my manager is a nazi... meh, my humor is wasted on too few people. Essentially Kikku (an Indian hyberbitch), is so damn cheap that she pinches every penny until lincoln bleeds from his eyes. My starting wage was $5.35, I mean wtf? I know a fifteen year old who is starting at 6. What really infuriates me is her propencity for passing the blame of not only herself but other employees onto me. Now, understand the following description will be part sarcastic:  [sarcasm]  Kikku in a hyperbitch voice (yeah, you know the one), "Well Jesus Christ Bryan, why the hell is the son shining, the customers aren't buying things as a result!"  Me, "Well I would imagine because the fusion reaction occuring is resulting in a release of light and heat energy, as for the employees..."  Kikku, "SHUT UP! I'm not paying you to talk"  [/sarcasm]  Meanwhile another employee will be out in the back smoking on an unpaid break. Seriously though, this bitch actually reminds me of the Lord of Terror herself... Ms. Power. I believe that this lady is the physical embodiement of being cheap.  [sarcasm]  I will slap on guacamole (or however it is spelled) and she will start screaming about how expensive it is and try to wipe it off. This of course is while the customer is right there watching her be cheap. The customer consequently, will run in terror as her cheap rays radiate throughout the store having witnessed this.  [/sarcasm]  I am then blamed for that because I am not  efficient  enough.  Other than the Lord of Cheap, there is this 27 year old guy who is in there with this longass gay poneytail all acting like a badass. He's like, "yeah, i'm just soo damn cool because i don't have a high school diploma and make sandwhiches to support myself. And as a result of my poor choices in life, I will be a total prick" I just wanna be, "dude, you're at quiznos... you're 27... wtf???" (of course i wouldn't say "wtf" i'd actually say, what the fuck)  Well, suffice to say, going to my job is like inserting a giant, rusty pole lined with barbed wire into my ass. Too graphic you say? I'm only talking about  going to my job . It wouldn't be legal to make an analogy to  being  there.  in other news, I happen to be volunteering at my church's Jesus class thing for little kids. I honostly believe there is a future childmolester/fag captain. You don't believe me, but this guy (who ironically resembles Piggy), no joke was humping another dude and grabing his "privates" throughout the day. I tried to stop him but i was just so stunned, "noo, don't do that, arrgh, for the love of Jesus" kept running through my mind.  Meh, I guess going to a Catholic Church you're bound to expect to see those sorts of things, haha.  See you later space samurai...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Dies ist mein mittleres Finger Weibchen!!! - 6/20/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That is an english to german free translation of " this is my middle finger bitch!!! ". I am thinking of quitting the store and saying that too the Quiznazi... obviously while holding up my middle finger. I'm thinking up a variety of phrases that I will say to her on my final exit of the store. Most of which are in the developmental stage.  Okay, so essentially I get phone call around 5:30 (keeping in mind this is one of the two days I get free this week) and guess who it is. Now, i'm sure most of you guessed Kikku, the physical manifestation of cheapness, and you are right. If you guessed someone else... than you may have been right, there probably were other people calling me around that time. She leaves this bullshit message:  [sarcasm]  "Bryan!!! This is Kikku, from Quizno's, yeah, you know the one you work at. Anyway, I need your help desperatly, the store is on fire, a pack of wolves have broken in and eaten some of the customers, baal and Diablo are running loose... oh, and we're short handed and need your help."  [/sarcasm]  I didn't pick up the phone and so my parents were like, " holy shit bryan, this is your opportunity to make her happy " or some bullshit like that. Now, my thinking was that I was going to leave her to be consumed by the fires of being a bitch and cheapness which she brought to the store, but finally I reluctantly called her back and told her I was coming. (hey, more money for me and I need to buy mroe games... or so I'm told)  Now, this is really my favorite part. I enter through the front door, and there are a bunch of people lined up trying to get their subs. No joke, it seemed like this blinding, heavenly light (as seen by Saul at his conversion on the road to Damascus) shone behind me and I was carrying the magical, holy sword of Tyreal. I step up and start helping Kikku and this other inexperienced guy make subs and while wrapping one up the guy (Andy) turns ot me and says, "my god... you have saved us."  It was the funniest thing. Now, Kikku's all like, "um, sweetie, could you clean the floor for me?". Granted, it was better than her usual, "Bryan, I need you to turn this bottle of water into wine in five seconds... or else", but the thing was it was such faked bullshit i wanted to laugh at her.  Much to my satisfaction, Sean, the 27 year old thug captain with gay hair, had apparently quit which is why they were short handed.  My final question is, in a one on one fight, what would you rather have, a sword, or a gun?  See you later space janitor...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ballad of the Fallen Angels... - 6/21/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Angels banished from heaven have no choice but to become demons...     My name... is Roac Wind    I have come to the conclusion that I am, despite what I would care for, much like a combination of my two favorite characters.  Roac Wind: Charismatic, he can bring a group of people (or an army for that matter) together with such vigor and passion. On the other hand, he's not as much a talented fighter, but he does have fighting spirit.  Brello Tsudanaga: Unrivalably physically strong, his strength comes from sheer determination and willpower, no man or beast can hold ground with him. Unlike Roac though, he is stoic and unfriendly. He prefers to do things on his own and generally hates people.  Hah, if only i could combine the two good traits! I have Roac's lack of physical talent combined w/ Brello's antisocialism. Now, as Nathril has pointed out, yes, I was yelling in agrument w/ him after knowing him for about a day. But while I can argue someone through a wall... or is it i can argue a wall (probably the latter), if i get on the right subject, I couldn't get up in front of a group of people and just start screaming and laughing. I'd be the one who goes in the corner and contemplates the physics of the room, anthropologizes the scenario if you will.  If I could come to school decked out in feudal japan clothes w/ a bigass katana at my side I would. "well bryan, you need to turn in your homework" my teacher would declare.  "HIETEN MITZURUGI STYLE UPPERCUT!!!" (reference to Rurouni Kenshin) By the end of that war cry, my sword would already have sliced my demonic instructor in half.  Yeah, that would be cool...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  May the 7th, 1945... today! - 6/26/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yes that's right, this was the day that the nazi regime was toppled by the allies (specifically the US b/c we just own ass). A similar feat was accomplished today by an american citizen, namely me. After several bloody weeks of non stop combat and skirmishes, I have found employment under a non fascist... I hope.  It's so great, I will be working at Rib Tickler with Bret, Ben and... uh, myself. Well, despite what you may think (you being whoever has been keeping up with the crap in my od) It took a bit of consideration on whether or not to switch jobs. Firstly, I'm already trained, and pretty damn good) at Quizno's, so more training will probably piss me off. Secondly, there is a super fine girl who works with me, i mean dayyyyyyymn. Lastly, I am sorta going out with this other chick who works there named ashley. No, this one could actually tell you that the UN is not just a prefix.  So in conclusion...  Boo!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Gimme a N-E-O-C-O-N... What's that spell? - 6/26/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, it has come to my attention that I have always been a conservative. Alright, when it comes to my faith I'm as liberal as they come... or so I am fathoming. But in regards to polotics, I've always agreed with the death penalty and opposed abortion. However, thanks to Ben having rubbed off on me this past year, I have converted to being a semi-neocon (neo conservative). But for a few liberal views, I am a full fledged conservative republican.  Ironically, back when I first met Nathril, I believe "conservative" to be synonomous with ignorant and short sighted. However, I believe a better term would be realist. Now, I was never the "give peace a chance" or "well, saddam isn't that bad of a guy" liberal, but I guess I just listened to D'Arrigo too much. Haha. Well, I left the final fantasy forums (I used it mainly for the debate forum) b/c everyone there was such a fucking liberal that I just couldn't stand it. I was the only conservative voice. Plus most of them were anti-american brits... go blair, fuck them.  Well, I guess my over-patriotism has increased my abrasiveness. Oh well.   War - Don't like it, wish we didn't need it but we do.   Peace - idealistic, human nature dictates that there will always be a bully   France - hasn't been useful since Napoleon's exile to St. Helena 1815   Gays - Deserve full rights (one of few lib views)   Black people bitchin' about being shipped from africa a while back - send them back to Africa   Illegal Immigrants - still considering this issue   Guantanamo Bay Detainees - shower them with pigs blood and see how many muslims want a peice of the US   Willy Clinton - go away, 8 years is up   Hilary Clinton - you're ugly and I don't want u as prez  See you later space Druid...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Listening must have gone out of style... - 6/27/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, I have recently recieved a series of "unhappy people notes" in regards to my neocon entry. One from someone unsigned, and the other 2 from nathril. Either they didn't read what I wrote or just don't understand what sarcasm is... or either. I deleted the notes because reading them almost made me vomit in disgust. However, here were the main complaints that I can remeber without barfing up my guts.   -You shouldn't call Hilary ugly, how vain   that really has nothing to do w/ being a Neocon, just felt like adding that in there. Now if whoever wrote that would be forthcoming with their name I will gladly point out that you can be equally vain.   -dumping blood on muslims! how disgusting, you disgust me!   You know what else is disgusting? Sending muslim extremists over here to kill 2,000+ people, I don't want to see that happen again, whoever left that note, please I'll send you a forward regarding something like that.   -Clinton should be allowed to speak out if he wants   I never said anything about preventing him from speaking, all I said was that he should stop bullshitting his way to a 3 presidential term.  finish this later  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Mission... - 6/28/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Some people set goals to lose weight, help out more around the house, or other beneficial things. I however, have chosen a route more suited for my abilities. I have decided that my mission for this summer is to play at least 2 games until their completion. Here is my current schedule:  Start by finishing Shadows of Undrentide, perhaps a few Morrowind or JK2 breaks in between.  After SoU, I will finish my half completed game of Icewind Dale 2... damn crap wizard. During the frustrating impossible areas I shall hope to conqure the world in an chiefton (eziest level) game of Civ III.  After that my mission is to continue questing on morrwind and perhaps gain the patience to complete Jedi Knight 2... it's so fucking impossible, the entire mission concept is stupid. The creators probably said, let's make an extra buck by having our game so counter intuitive that you have to buy the strategy guide. I mean shit, it's stuff like, hop on one leg down the jedi mine field, then throw your lightsaber at the sun all while being dressed like a clown. the multiplayer is fun but I want to fuck the programmers who made the single player up the ass with a metal rod of death.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  why am i doing a survey thing? - 7/11/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  1.

Got pantsed? that was probably spelled wrong, but I may have been once... iduno, maybe  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  middle fingers are popular, but have one anyway.. - 7/12/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now, I've never been one to randomly get pissed off. Well, i take that back, i'm usually just pissed off all the time. But after having been going consistantly to ffgurus (a forum swarming with abortion addicts, sex fiends and overall thugs), and seeing some random diaries, mostly dedicated to how having sex with eight people and doing drugs simulatneously is fun, I have become VERY pissed at one main thing.   "nonconformists"   Two key points about that term.  A. it mainly applies to goths, bangers and band nerds who have gained either of these mentalities, etc... basically anyone who thinks they are above the "populars" (these aren't generalizations, just tendencies)  B. The reason it's in quotations, is because the term  nonconformists  is a falactious term that has lost all substance over the years. I will explain this further down.  Am I pissed off because they act a certain way? Yes and no. I would first like to point out, cutting wrists, listening to "underground music", hating black people music, and being an antisocial, is okay in my book. If you want to act like that, be my fucking guest, I'll prepare a bed for you. But it's not what they do, but it's how they carry themselves. Nearly every single one has this dogma that dictates that if you shop from "A&amp;E, A&amp;F, Polo, etc" that you are shallow, and have no inner soul. Also, because the  nonconformists  don't wear A&amp;E, they have been elevated to a higher level of thinking, that they have become gods among the hollow, candy coated  populars . (ironically many are atheists).  They also tend to have a skewed sense of what freedom is. Their belief on "freedom of speech" means that they can say whatever the fuck they want, but if someone told them to be quiet, that's an infringement on their freedom of speech. Here's the thing, to say to another citizen, "shut up, I have freedom of speech" is a contradiction. I have taken John Stewart Mill's philosophy on freedom.    "freedom is the right to pursue one's own good in one's own way, so long as that pursuit does not infringe on another's right to do the same."   The first amendment was set in place so that the government couldn't come down and tell you to stop preaching about whatever. It doesn't give choice people the opportunity to say whatever they want while disregarding other people. "one person's rights end where another's begin"  That misuse of freedom of speech basically generalizes the crux of their mentality. They have been blinded, blinded by their attempts at being different. They have been blinded by flashy words, by the candy exterior, without knowing what's inside, and why... whether or not they are willing to admit to it.  In closing, I am a nerd, I watch anime (i'm listening to anime music right now), game constantly, and have little respect for "image" or "social status". I am neither a  popular , nor a  nonconformist . I understand that I am influenced by external things. I don't dislike  nonconformists  based on their disregard for "pop culture", or their sometimes radical views on politics. I dislike their belief that they are better than everyone because they shop at hot topic, or spencers. Both sides,  populars  and  nonconformists  hate each other because of their differences. That is to be expected, but goths think they are so damn special. No one is truly different anymore.

According to a nameless banger who has no sense between his mop-like head, believes that morality is determined by a higher force, that God ultimatly determines what is right and wrong. Essentially that morality is as tangible, that there is a physical manifestation of what is right and wrong, that being the bible. However, how would this person explain the fact that there are over 5,000 Christian denomonations alone? Are their visions on what is moral skewed? That they have lost sight of what is moral. Who is to decide what is moral or not.  Obviously I believe that Saddam Hussien and his late children were evil people.  Evil . I believe this world is for the most part polar, there is an end to every begining, a good to every evil, morality to imorality. I believe this as I believe the sun in the sky. How can one see the light if not from the shadows; or see the shadows, if not from the light?  Looking back at my classification of Saddam as "evil". Is he truly evil? Saddam is no more "evil" in the truest sense, than I am "good". This is because there is no way to determine that someone is evil. The two polar concepts are non-existant on a worldly level. Though I may percieve someone to be evil, my opinion no more effects that person, than would my opinion that gray is the best color.    One Winged Angel   " Tomball is essentialy a dry well ", Bryan, in regards to possible female companions.  There are two main factors that I look at when deciding upon someone whom I would enjoy spending extended periods of time with on a relationship basis. Each factor is broken up into three components.  As I have stressed repeatedly to Nathril and Ascaril, I need to rent out a lot in the mall and put up a sign calling it "the anime, gaming and debating store". That is my "triforce", I value those things highest. If my girlfriend cannot understand, or appreciate at least one of those, what would I talk about?  Secondly, is my vision on morality. The three prime evils (no, not the ones of uglyness, whole other story... perhaps covered in my next entry), are sex, drugs and alchohol. I now despise these things mainly on Ben's influence. "the true test of a man's character is the ability not to give into temptation", unknown.    The Irregularity   Cris, I've known her for two years. I love her to death. Though she hates drugs and alchohol as much as I do, she is... sexually open. Despite this, I don't care. When I discovered the Phantom had sex, I began to despise her. Yet Cris is more open than even her. And yet, for some reason it doesn't bother me... It's the damndest thing. I know not if it is love... or somethign else.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  When one door closes... - 7/27/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ... yeah, you're pretty much fucked if you don't open it back up  I would like to start this entry off (which I began writing at aproximatly 3:07 CSTam) with a reference to PA.    ----------   Gabe: "Hey everybody... I'm up. I' awake. So what is this? What are we doing? Who is this guy?  Guy: "I'm Will Wright, you're interviewing..."  Gabe: "Okay, okay, okay.  Shh . Listen. We're going to play a little game, it's called Sim Get Me Some Fucking Coffee,  fucker . Fuck you!  Fuck , it's early.  Tycho: "And they canceled your show... just like that?  Gabe: "I know, what the fuck?"    ----------   Now, I'm so fucking tired right now I shall be afuckingmazed if anyone can interpret this bullshit as actual human writing. If not... then I'll look back and realize sleep is needed. Of course I'll probably keep gaming or something, but I'll have thought of it at least. And isn't it the thought that counts? No... no it is not.  Back to my story which wasn't quite finished off... and has had some additions... and that I am writing right now. Okay, so about Cris. As I may or may have not addressed, she is currently going out with someone. Now, in my humble opinion, he's kinda tool. He has absolutly no sense of humor, listens to bad music, and is overall, very unhappy. (jake, he's the guy we met when we went over to her house and he was really quiet because he's not friendly... yeah, you remember him... or else) So after having informed her of my feelings for her, keeping in mind that at the time he was basically telling her he was falling out of love for her, she's depressed and other crap, she goes "well I have a boyfriend". Woah, i'm really fucking tired. So essentially she tells taylor (name of boyfriend) that I asked her out, as a result he starts reappreciating her (that's barely a word) and now I'm back to square one.  Today I planned on calling her and giving her some speech thing about this that and some other crap which escapes my memory for the time being. It was just going to be some, you know, I just dont like the I cant wait forever crap. However, I thought to myself, that being very much like me, she'd probably do the "oh, well okay" apathetic crap which is what I always do when placed in a similar situation. So instead, I just said, "ya know, calling you and telling you to break up w/ him and telling you taht i love you won't make a damn bit'a difference, so whenever you break up, give me a call." That was it except for some other rhetoric.  I doubt I'll actually care if/when she calls though. I mean quite frankly, I just don't feel like trying right now. Holy crap im' tired.  See you later space... shit i'm tired  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Azurewrath... - 8/5/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  okay, so I've been thinking. Jake and I write similarly in this sense. After you read the entry, you kind of scratch your head and wonder what the fuck is that. the reason for me is because I write off into so many different angles its hard to understand if there was actually a point. usually, there is not. for jake, it is because he uses so many adjetives, and other poetic things that it turns into... well a giant ass poem. Example of how I write compared to jake:  [bryan]  okay, so here's the thing, I got pissed off at work today because my friend f**king backstabbed me and made me feel like my pants were on fire... WHILE IM IN THE CRAPPER, I mean what the hell?  [/bryan]  [jake]  Today, as I entered the work place, betrayal cast a shadow into the room, as one who I once considered to be a friend, an ally snuck up behind me and drew a blade, which was aimed at my back side. The blade drew blood, for its name was betrayal, and lies. the blood poured from my soul as the transverlesence (made up word) of my existance was sapped away like a fly enjoying a snack before its death brought on by humanity.  [/jake]  So there you have it. and just for fun, this entry will be twice as long because for every paragraph I write like myself, it shall be written like jake.    In the begining   [bryan]  Does anyone remember POP youth? Yeha, i do, and it sucked few years ago. as of recent I remember hwo I need community service to fill in for the gap chemistry and alg 2 left this year... DAMN YOU WINDOW!!! So I go back to join the "club" again. First time I fell in love with shell... yeah, that fucked up huh? yeah... it did. So this time, I'm finding myself attracted to this other chick, tiffane'... yes the "'" is actually part of her name, what the fuck? My main concern, is that it'll either fuck up, or not work... which is the same as fucking up consequently. Btw, I fell outa love w/ cris... i am not a man of patience.  [/bryan]  [jake]  Looking back to a time of joy, and sadness, I recollect my actions at the community of prince of peace. There was much sucking that transpired on those fateful days... how I weep for my time wasted in the abysmal place that it was... and for a part... is. The void caused by my unforgiving grades in chemistry and algebra 2, I suppose, must be filled with something else... so i now assume that the filler of thsi void must be community service... DAMN YOU WINDOW!!! As a result of this void of ultimate despair, I return to the partially abysmallic (possibly a made up word) to aquire a healthy bonus to my resume'. Among my recollections of the abyss, were the epochs I spent attempting to find the heart of the one I loved so dearly, that being the heart of michell, which turned to stone, and then to (cold Item #103 not found). The time chasing this heart most unfortuantly... was time wasted, time which shall never return to me for it was stolen by the (greek god #391 not found) and who keeps it close to her. However, my eyes are now open to a new heart which I am currently in pursuit of. The name of venus at my church, is Tiffane'. The only fear that dwells in my pain wrought heart, is the ultimate fear, the fear that my love will vanish, like a breath in the cold winter wind, upon which love is breathed. Cris, has fallen from the locker which I hold my caring for. Patience is weak in this rusty locker of DOOM!  [/jake]  2 Side notes, Azurewrath, is the name of Tyreal's holy sword in Diablo 2. And ICH BIN DER KONIG!!! AUS KEINE HOSEN... yeah, ido speak a little nazi...  See you later space... uh, crap factory?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  A delightful game of guess who... - 8/7/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yes, the game today is guess who... is being a major cockass. The way this works is, I shall give my audience 2 hints regarding who this person is. Whoever notes first with the correct answer, wins... nothing most likely, i'm too damn poor.   Hint #1: This person has a name  Hint #2: That name is Bret Machelek  now, most of you... yeah, most of nathan, haha. Is probably wondering how exactly Bret is being a cockass. Well, he informed me about 2 days into my employment at rib tickler that I only have one channel, such that I act the same in almost every place. He on the other hand has three, one for school, church and work. This has been all the more apparent as of recent however. He really has been nothing but an absolute asshole for the last week or so. He constantly reminds me how it took me 3 weeks until sylvia allowed me to do drive through alone, and rubs it in my face in attempt to make me feel,  lesser . He also overly exagerates the time I asked him to helpe me cut bannanas. I cannot do it fast, there's probably some trick to it, and iwanted to know hwo. He, in his "rib tickler divinity" assumed that I asked him how to cut a bannana. Now, if he just fucks around with me, i really dont care. but when he does it around sylvia, who now treats me as she would a sub human, i tend to get a little pissed off. Obviously i'm pissed off about those things. But i'm really fucking furious about what he said to heather, his current girlfriend. Keeping in mind the fact, that the entire time he was gone on jesus vacation, I was telling heather to go out with him and what a great guy he was. Obviously they started going out, its all good ya know? A week after that she heads off to some lake place... terrible memory. So I would call her every other day or so because I think she's a great friend. When she got back and she came into rib tickler for a brief period, she came by and gave me a hug and started talking to me. iduno why, me being the least threatening person, but bret apparently got jealous or something, and told heather NOT to talk to me. Regardless, we had a long discussion regarding what a fuck head he's been the night following. The ironic thing is, he was pissed off at paul, her last boy friend because paul was too needy, and wouldnt let anyone else be with her. Despite this, bret would always hug and kiss her. Bret is now a fucking ass cocking hypocrit who eats dick, shit and a variety of other things that are unmentionable.  perhaps having just one channel makes me less flexible, and not as many people will like me, but I feel like I do less alienating whenever I just act like myself. The way i see it, I should change my environment, not let my environment change me.  See you later space S.W.A.T. team...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Captain Your Mom Bitch... - 8/8/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I recently left a note on jake's diary. The content is absurd and after having reread it, i want to vomit in disgust. It has occured to me that for the most part, I am a random person. However, that leads me to believe that my  random  nature, has lead me to be quite dependable in that sense. To put it frankly, you can count on me to do some frivolously random thing. I still maintain that if you use the correct algorithm you could basically track my zillion trains of thought, such that if during a discussion about food consumption I interject why I think cartman is a funny guy, you would easily be able to determine why I said that. Here, let me demonstrate, (keeping in mind, this scenario is a real life thing):  Food consumption = poop  poop = dooty in the river  dooty in the river = recollection of mr. hankie  mr. Hankie = south park  south park = cartman  So though I may say random things, they are not necissarly as random as possible. And if you ask me to just say a random word, you may notice that if you make me do it enough, i'll just cycle through the same words/numbers. Though I'm not thinking as clearly as I would... if i was able to think clearly, I am thinking of some commonly used "random words/numbers"  12, a gazillion, hojillion, 5, eat poop  watermellon, dooty, boobies, Hoo Ah, and a variety of other crap I dont care to mention.  Ironically enough, that reminds me of something else. I tend ot say the same dumb phrases over and over again. in fact, I usually catch myself saying them while in conversation, for absolutly no reason at all. Which reminds me of how shannon, for 2 consecutive years has eaten with me and either jake or nathan, and each year has explained how she needs to get new friends. It will be interesting to see if this year is actually any different in any way shape and or form.  Phrases:  "which reminds me" -often, what was previously said reminded me of nothing, I just felt like adding something in.  "you see, the thign is" -used almost at every time i'm ready to make a point, keep in mind hand gestures are usually highly active  "Keeping in mind" -used to sp ecify something or another  "now obviously," -i'm probably doing this in a condescending way... dumb liberals... haha, i'm just joking, I mainly use it on people like the lords of evil... yeah, you know 'em.  "Your mom" -actually, I dont even say that much anymore.. comparitvly anyway  "Hoo ah" -no explanation needed  "the moral of the story is" -said whenever wrapping up a speech of some sort and wish to throw in a last bit of nonsesible horse crap  So, it is in my opinion that your mom needs to good night!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Master Sword... - 8/11/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    I just love when you get The Master Sword lv3 from the fat fairy under ganon's temple... it's got such a powerful *Swoosh*, it's like the heavens bow before it   Yep, so we're going out now. We being Tiffane' and myself. I took her out to the mall and we just goofed around for a while. Seriously though, who would imagine spending $20 on nail polish? wtf? Iduno, its a freakin' rip off like dimonds and gas but meh.  damnit, i'm too angry to finish this right now...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Reverse Blade Sword... - 8/12/2003  &nbsp;    Hitori de wa tooi ashita o  yoake no mama de koesou de  butsukatteikya kokeru omoi yo  kon’ya mo mata surechigai   I'm reserving this space for my constant complaints about school, specifically going to it.

Sonofbitch, no one really can fathom just how fucking stupid my parents are. I mean, its like someone came down here and just deep fried their already simian brains. Now, i'm willing to bet some of you... yet again, some of nathan, have interpreted that I am angry. And yes, I am most furious right the fucking now damnit bitch. My parents really have no idea what the hell their doing, seriously. This is their idea of punishment.  *mother comes into bryan's room playing a computer game when he has work to do*  Mom, "that's it bryan, I'm taking away your cell phone... that'll teach you to play on your computer"  Bryan expresses a blank stare, then turns to rage, "what hte hell? why would you take away my cell phone?"  Mom returns a "are you dumb" look, "Well duh, i'm teaching you a lesson, you'll thank me some day"  Bryan scratches head and looks at the ground, "mom... the computer and cell phone are two completely different things."  Mom tilts head and does classic scooby doo "huh?"  And then my car is taken away whenever I talk on the phone too much.. What the hell, I think they're taking the "head up ass" approach at parenting. I've been under this sort of thing my whole life. Ironically enough, my cell phone and car have been  temporarily  suspended. I really have no ifuckingdea when they will be returned. Seriously, what the fuck is this??? I'm so agoddamn pissed off right now i could either do something like... get angry, or even yell a little bit. well, i asked brent if i could get aride with him, he said yes but noooooooooooo i cant ride w/ him the first fucking day. I really think my dad's head is so far up his ass, he's eating shit, which goes into his stomach which is then eaten again. Thus, he's just in a big cycle of eating shit essentially. I really can't fucking wait to get to fucking college. No fuckin lie.  In synopsis, my parents are assholes. 'nuff sed.  ( btw, i'm taking bets that nate will leave some sort of, "well its your own damn fault" thing... starting is fitty dollas )  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Another Wasted Year of my Life... - 8/13/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yep, school sucks no matter what, so don't be fooled by grade advances... First day of my junior year of High School, and what a day it's been. No fucking joke, well, here's the run down for my classes that I had today... damn that stupid 6period a day thing.  Period I, Debate 2:   Pros:   Seriously, this will epitomize my happiness this year. I've already had more fun in one day than a barrel of venom spitting cobras.   Cons:   That one damn senior for some reason either hates me or is merely iritated by me, possibly both... also the class is only every other day, damnation  Period III, Pre-cal PAP:   Pros:   Rand is in my class... 'nuff sed   Cons:   It's a math class... 'nuff sed  Period IV, History CC:   Pros:   PRAISE GOD ALMIGHTY, I have Ben in my class... the teacher seems to be conservative for the most part and knows my brother which may come as a plus   Cons:   But for Ben and me, it's filled with a bunch of crazy ass liberals who really couldnt point out the american flag in a store that sells only american flags, oh and the teacher is insanely feminist. Not that I have anything against women having equal rights, i just don't think they deserve to vote or work... hahaha, just joking, i'm sipmly afraid i'll say some semi-chauvanistic remark and get sent to jail.  Period V, Phyisics:   Pros:   "well, look on the bright side... you're soaked in urine"   Cons:   BOOOOOOOORING, nothing but a bunch of morons in class who measure their success on how many bitches they can knock up in one sitting. heh... nuff sed  Period VI, Comm Aps:   Pros:   I enjoy speaking... alot   Cons:   It seems errily familiar to my debate class last year, not a bridge i'd like to cross again... 'nuff sed  Period VII, English III CC:   Pros:   Eh, I think i enjoy english, plus the course is based on writing which i sort of like, but for the stuff i dont like writing... damn procrastination   Cons:   The teacher seems sort of like the lord of Insanely liberal and stupid comments and uglyness... ironically enough she's also in my class...  &nbsp;  See you later space Neuro-Surgeon...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "A Total Ass Raping Cock Captain..." - 8/15/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yep, that senior from debate, taylor, is "a total ass raping cock captain"... nuff sed  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Fate is Fickle... - 8/21/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I... am a selfish.  I want... a woman who understands me.  I really need... a companion, to share my troubles with.    Fate it seems... is not without a sense of irony.  ~Morpheous   Darkness had consumed my heart for the longest time. Finally, not but a week and three days ago had light peirced it. Not only had I gained the courage to ask someone out, they accepted. I suppose however, the entire situation was doomed from the start. Though I say this almost every day, i'm just not charasmatic. Praise and Worship (praying through singing and clapping) just isnt my thing. In fact, I hate it with a passion. She on the other hand loved it, P&amp;W is her favorite thing to do. That may seem like some immaterial thing, but it roots deeper in my primary reason for why I want a companion. "for no one else but me", damnit, what's a companion more than a title if they aren't close to your heart? I long for one so that I can just hold them when I'm feeling down, and despite what the world thinks, I'm not always smiling. I long for one so that when she's had a bad day at school, I can hold her. That is not... no, was not her style.  Beach Retreat... 2 years ago, I feel in love with Michelle. This year, I suppose I feel out of love with my companion. In the forty eight hours there, we probably spent thirty minutes truly alone together. If we would sit down to listen to a speech, she would go by her friends, walking right past me. I would look at her from across the room, laughing and having fun. Nothing crushes me more than that. Not to say that I dont want her happy, or to have friends, but I want to be apart of that. I hate exclusion. The bus trip home, she didn't sit by me, much less speak with me. If any of you know the pain you get when your hopes, dreams and passion, is crushed in an instant, you know my pain. There is no pain equal to seeing the one you love laughing and hugging another guy. Even if they're just friends.  One hour.  From the time I got off the bus, until bible study, my gut was going through some of the most intense suffering I have ever expereienced. The feeling matched few times in my life. At bible study I planned to confront her with this, and explain to her why i feel this way, why I'm so fucking selfish, why it kills me to see her away from me. But she gets in the first word. Or phrase for that matter. " Let's be friends ". What a fucking joke, what a fucking insane joke that is. For really, how can I look at her the same as I would some random girl, or even as a friend of many years. It's imfuckingpossible. There is one thing I hate in this world above most things. It is pouring yourself into a hole. Or into something that is unsubstantial. I poured my love (and 20 dollars, fuck that was expensive nail polish) into an hole. Darkness has consumed my heart once more...    Just fade... fade away...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Bastards!

I have chosen a mirror. I think my valley of shittyness has reached a new low. Meh, I think this just happens at the beggining of each year. But who do I turn to?  -Nathan, something has happened. he has changed... i once thought i could talk to him about anything. now quite the opposite is true.  -Jake, our scope of conversation doesn't venture far past anime and porn... or both.  -Ben/Bret, i'm not part of the debate team i'm in it. I'm not a part of work, i just show up. somehow this summer has fuzed the two at the nuts.  -Shannon, iduno, summer of '02 was the peak i guess.  -Cris, i guess Gin and juice the reremix has occured, we are not on speaking terms. Why? b/c her boyfriend is just like i am.  -Calvin, ... why did i even write that?  -PoP youth group, that's laughable  -God, it seems every time i give thanks for something, I get fucked over.  -Tiffane', oh wait, she's part of PoP, hahahahaha (fuck PoP)  .... wow, i dont have that many friends  I've turned to so many people, I've done a complete 360 going back to myself.  No man is an island . Fuck it, i'm a damn rock. Quite frankly, i'm pissed off, i hate work, i hate school, and sad to say, i hate debate. No fucking lie. Ever since i walked into that class, i'ts been debate one all over again. Ridicule and ostracizing. Key difference, now its from my "friends" and the ass raping cock captain. Derocher seems genuinly concerned, but yet again, i get blamed for thigns others dont. exp: my group laughs when someone presents a point so absurd i'm sure a baby died somewhere as a result. The bitch tells D that we shouldnt laugh at her, so we, specifically I, get bitched out. Ironically enough, when I was talking, the same person was either ignoring me the whole time or laughing, yet when icommented on this, I was mocking her. What the fuck?  Let's do the run down of my fucking gay fucking schedule:  1. debate, shitty, shitty more shit  2. nazi 2, i hate nazis, nuff sed  3. precal, i have rand, funny class, gay work  4. US hist, cool teacher, hard class (did i mention i have to live up to my brother's image in there?)  5. Physics, gay, nazis everywhere, cant make fun of them cause nazi exhange student is in class. Btw, apparently by not viewing germany as the dominant nation in this world, i am a "pain in the ass" so says some fascist.  6. comm aps, that class is like debate I in content, same stupididty, different stupid people... i'm apparently funnier in there though... "hop on the flow dog"  7. english, cant fucking wait to get outa school at that point in time.  As for debate team, i'm basically a lesser person in there because i'm not part of the "officers". fuck that, fuck the world, and fuck you too. Do you know how much it hurt me when i found out that i am basically a nobody in the team? well, if you guessed alot or higher, you are correct.  PoP, i'm so fucking afraid of failing matt, you have no ifuckingdea. It's worse than my fear of... well not cockroaches, holy shit it was flying EVERYWHERE... but it's dead now.  Rib Tickler, fuck my shitty hours, fuck my shitty pay, fuck the fucking motherfucking world.  Your mom bitch!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Battousai the Manslayer... - 9/1/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  well, many of you are wondering how this title came into being. The topic for tonight is Stagnation and its greatness. That made me think of a quest in the game Diablo where Cain the elder explained how the rivers ran stagnant. And what's one of the best swords in that game? The grandfather, which happens to be a katana. and who uses katanas? None other than Samurai X, Kenshin Himura, otherwise known as, Battousai the manslayer. Random, no. Algorithmically sound.    Stagnation   I had an epiphany moment as I exited 249 after work on Saturday. It was around 9 O'clock, and I was actually content, which is unusual having just come back from work. It's dark out, the music is up loud, and somehow the right turn signal comes on, I pull out of 249, onto spring cypress. As I am doing this, I realized something. There was no thought involved. It was a routine action i've preformed a hundred times before, and shall do a thousand more. And then it smacked me in the face. Why i sucked at work for the longest while, why this year is really pissing me off, why I'm a terrible driver. It all suddenly clicked. I seem to pick up on things very slowly, if at all, but when I do, it becomes natural, like breathing. I live my life passivly, moving by through routine, and when something changes, i am forced to change. Thus, i go out of my routine. Though I may not be exciting by any accounts, i am far more level headed than my brother for example. Idont get pissed off but a few times every now and again. But that in and of itsself is routine. I'm trying to write fast so cpt PBP can read it before his bed time, lol.  So why am I pissed off? Because, during the summer, Ben and i couldnt be closer... well, if he was a hot girl... maybe. But when he started working w/ me, everything changed. He and bret buddied up at the nuts, and now i'm "3/7's of a person" according to Ben. I prefer things to stay the same, even if they suck, because I like something dependable. Which is why i hate Austen and people like him. He can't stay in one mood for mroe than a minute.  See you later space porn director...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Drunkening... - 9/9/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  And no, i'm not quite sure if that is or is not a word. A discussion with Jageitay Bellajur, Drew, and Nate, really explained to me why it is that i'm glad to not be in the 'in' crowd. If there is one thing that really makes me sick to my stomach, it is underage drinking. It sickens Jake, and is morally unsound to Ben, both are true for me. go 18th amendment. Nathan on the other hand, who I would consider to be a vagrant among the cliques nowadays, considers it humorous, and even to a smaller extent applauds those people who get drunk off their ass. I recall one time in english when Jared wsa explaining how he got Stephanie Gomez to wave at him in the hall. Bare in mind, she is physically attractive, I have also come to the understanding that she is not the peak of morality in my opinion. I personally could care less if a hot person took notice of me, for my undying philosophy is that action yields similar action. If I have to try hard to get someone to take notice of me, I'm not going to try at all. I wouldn't consider anyone in that crowd above me, nor I above them... well, maybe.  for being someone who talks endlessly, it's difficult to say that I find it hard to explain my utter disgust for obscene alcholic consumption. I believe it's partly because I don't even know why people do it. I can't fathom why someone would subjigate their body to physical torture, kill brain cells, and in the case of someone who will remain unnamed, suffer alchohol posioning. I can't understand why if someone chooses not to drink, they emerse themselves in alchoholism, ignorance, darkness. I must not be openminded enough to question the sheer joys of throwing up at 3 in the morning, or being forced to clean up someones excriments and vomit while being hung over. (reference to my brother's friend's bachelor party, he's not a drunk, just drinks socially, not that I approve) I probably just need to expand my mind to the incomprehensible pleasure of losing my mind.  Losing my mind, one thing I cannot do. That must be it. That must be why I hate drinking. The thought of not being at 100%, or anywhere near that is unsettleing. Intoxication disgusts me, it frightens me, and if that is the prerequisite to being put in a group of popular people, then I am more than happy to be apart of the 'nerd clique'. I'm happy to know that debating and speech is my strength, and that i'm not ashamed to admit that.  I think Nathan's desire to become an openminded person, to alter his inital mentality that preps are the spawn of Diablo, he has become one, or at least, a part of him has. Now, I never agreed with his mental crusade on the preps, I felt them equal to any other clique. Damn fucking drunks.    "You speak of knowledge, Judicator? You speak of experience? I have journeyed through the darkness between the most distant stars. I have beheld the births of negative-suns and borne witness to the entropy of entire realities..." - Zeratul  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Vagrant... - 9/11/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I would like to state first and foremost that this entry, and all others written in my diary are based on my opinion, and my outlook on the world. In the event that you disagree, I apologize that you do not see eye to eye with me, but I cannot help that. So don't get pissed off and cry.  You know what's been pissing me off lately? Debate. I swear to fucking gosh, it's become a shit hole. not that I havnt addressed that recently, but i'm really in a fucking bad mood. I'm pissed off for two different reasons completly, however, both are related directly to debate.  Firstly, the damn officer thing. I think that the way officers were "elected", if you could even call it that, was done entirly by black magic. Let me do the run down of who is what of the four differnet officers.  President: Ben  Vice: Bret  Cpt of Speech: kassie  Cpt of Debate: Shannon  I agree completely that ben should be pres, he has more nfl points than the next four runners up. And shannon, well, it's a copmlicated matter that, granted she is better than me. Well, on one hand, Bret is Vice president. Obviously he has been in debate longer than me. But it is in my honost opinion that he is not that great at debate, he has barely 20 more points than me, and has been in debate a year longer. On the other hand, Kassie is head of speech. speech events include: prose, poetry, oratory, extemp and basically everything non-LD or CX debate. The ONLY thing she does, is prose. I on the other hand have done extemp, prose and oratory before. So I fail to see how she is this omnipotent person in that sense.  Now, if the whole officer schpeal was the same as last year, the lack of being an officer would only slightly piss me off. But no, last year being an officer was just a pretty title. This year, they have their own fucking "office" which is little more than a bunch of pens in the smaller practice room, and there are all these fucking "officers only meetings" which piss the fuck outa me. It's like, i'm not even their friends anymore. which for the most part is true now.  btw, Kassie isnt a star debater herself either.  Secondly, is the way Ms. D treats me. In the event that I was to pick up one of shannon's pens in order to flow something, she'd jump on my back and start carving out my neck. Conversly, and this is a true story mind you, Bret, at the last tournament (5-6 of september 2003), Bret had siezed not only my jacket but also my briefcase while I was away. He had changed the combination on it, thus making it impossible for me to open for a time. He then proceeds to waltz over to follow Ms. D in my jacket, and swinging my briefcase in the air. In all honosty, I think the value of the briefcase and suit jacket alone far exceeds shannon's pen or backpack, and yet she says nothing to Bret. When he got out my Risk board and started fucking aroudn with it, she said nothing. If he was going ot play a game, i coulda cared less, but he was just fucking the little soldiers, and i'm sure he lost several. Ms. D doesn't even give it a fucking thought. Because she basically demonstrated no respect for me at all during that tournament, I, in response did not yield her any. I basically piddled around and was unresponsive to whatever she asked of me. Keeping in mind i only started doing this after the flailing around of my Jacket occured.  I've resolved to never bring Risk again.  But it doesn't stop there. Bret, as I've mentioned before, seems to enjoy bringing up eveyrone of my shortcomings at work, be it my fear of giant bugs, or lack of common sense. He doesnt stop. And it has been going on for as long as we've been in school. Now, similarly as the ms. D resopnse, I dont get mad, I get even. So thinking back to when Heather told me about how he was making out w/ this one girl. (side note: this girl is the ugliest thing alive. I dont even rate her in regards to Angie simply because she wasn't entirly human). So, I figure I may as well bring that up to Bret, because apparently everything that occurs in the workplace is fair game. Bret saw it differently, he got so pissed off and said, "i dont like bringing that up". He excused his unrelenting attacks on me as "payback for when I brought up the 'buff, witty and good looking' note". Yet again, vengeance is a double edged sword.    "... And so the greatest warrior had his blood poured into a sword, armor and cloak; so that he could vanquish evil... even after death."   The Tale of the Vengeance Suit  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Sword of Vengeance... - 9/12/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    "... The Sword of Vengeance has two sides, one of pure white, to represent that it must be wielded by one with a pure heart, and that it's purpose is to vanquish evil. The other side, is pure black, to represent that there is evil in all things, and those who succumb to sin, become sin..."   Now, it's in my opinion that cruelty yeilds cruelty, and kindness yeilds kindness. Nathan refuted this, not that i was surprised, however, this is a principle I will stick to. For the past five weeks, my character has been attacked, my ethics, and the way I present myself. Kick me in the balls once... i'll fall on the ground and cry. Do it a second time, and the same thing will occur... but the third time!!! I'll get up and kick you in the balls. Sure, nathan says how i act gay, and on other occasions am dumb. But the tri-attack shit just doesn't bode will with me. So, i've decided to present my opinion on bret and ben, based on their character, ethics and presentation. Obviously i'm writing this down because I have a terrible memory and, well, it's on my damn mind.  Character:  Bret- Seriously, he made out with the UGLIEST female ever. His justification, "I was desperate", what, the fuck? That's foul under any circumstances.  Ben- gossip, i can only imagine what is said about me when my back is turned.  Ethics:  Bret- I'm a racist because I say 'nigga'. Which, according to Ben and Bret, is not a commonly used word anymore. Who listens to rap? Oh yeah, me. I'm sorry, but I'm friends with so many black people its not even funny, shannon is a great friend, and I think Raul is hilarious. So I'm not sure what ethnic group I don't like. White people maybe?  On the other hand, Bret is not what I'd consider to be a shining light of morality or ethical standards either. The fact that he didn't feel his relationship with heather was moving "fast enough" in the sexual sense, or the fact that he jumps from girlfriends on a weekly basis, is a clear indicator of promescuity. Secondly, he seems to be drinking and smoking more frequently than not, maybe not to get drunk, but drinking is still drinking in my opinion.  Ben- He's anti-Catholic. That in and of itsself is shitty enough. Dont care what religion, anti-anyreligion, is not only immoral, but dumb.  Presentation:  Bret- A Judas to the last drop of blood. He would constantly tell me at work how he always talked me up and shit. And yet, no matter how close you are to someone at one point, stabbing in the back changes the whole situation. Judas was buddies w/ Jesus... until he betrayed him. Not just to me, but wherever he is, his back turns another way. When the people were making fun of Ben at work (they said he was gay and a prick), bret would say, "yeah, well, pretty much". I on the other hand defended him, even when jake and heather thought he was an introverted prick.  Ben- about at charasmatic as a crab  Btw, nate, thanks for the humor comment, I try... I try  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Roac Spoke, and the Whole World Heard... - 9/15/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'd really like to know when my personal thoughts and feelings which I choose to put on the internet have become a great source for information. I was told recently, by note ironically, that I need to stop talking about people on my Open Diary where everyone can see it. 2 things about that, one serious, one not.  Serious: There are 2 relativly consistant readers I have, Nate and Jake (I think jake goes to the sparknotes version, but o well). I don't really consider writing down emotions I have trouble expressing verbally to my friends, " ...saying this on an opendiary for everyone to read... "  Unserious: This isn't an Open Diary, those cost money, I have a FREE Open Diary.  In all honosty, I don't go around school, or anywhere I go for that matter handing out cards to my FOD, in fact, there are about 6-7 people who even knew I had one before I began writing about this conflict. Now it's like, maybe 9-10. Fact of the matter is, no one really cares what I think. Though I like to act differently, my opinion, or insight on someone is not going to make that drastic a change. Especially if few people actually read it. If however, I do attempt to degrade someone's character, it is either common knowlege, which was addressed recently, or I do it in retaliation, which is what the recent events are encompassing. I'd like to reiterate the fact that not only have I been called a racist to my face, but also people have made this accusation to my teachers, tell me then, how is that not speaking ill, truthfully or not. By the way, I don't really think I'm a racist. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I could work at rib tickler which is staffed mostly by mexicans (and yes, they do ask to be called this), or in my comm apps class in which there are like five black kids whom I converse with the most out of the class.  All in all, Sara, I retract my use of the word bitch to describe you. I was not mad at you, in fact, I felt bad for having laughed during ya'lls speech, what I am mad about, and always get pissed off about, is when Derocher shows sympathy towards one person, or favors someone, but does quite the opposite to another. I am not a fan of favortism. Life's a bitch.  See you later space tv show host...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  A Bunch of Shit... - 9/18/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Did you know if you put "Poop" in the diary search for titles, it comes up with 65 different diaries? How crazy is that. Having looked that up may be one of the reasons I have yet to complete my english paper. Damnation!  Go in the peace of God my friends.  Shit.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Meditation... - 9/21/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  just for the hell of it, 1:12 am  I'm pissed off for two reasons right now... among the other things. I suppose these two ideas are just stuck in my mind, eating away at what's left of my soul. (well shit, i'm talking Jake now). The damned thing of it is, this entry will probably make people laugh when it's not supposed to.  Okay, I would like to point out that I'm not very serious. There are probably about 2 times that I can be serious, in a debate round (i'm laughing or bitching in class and dancing around at tourneys), and probably when i'm asleep. Consequently, I am never serious, and always a big pile of happy to everyone i'm around. Fact of the matter is, i get pissed off, frustrated, stressed out, and unhappy relativly frequently. And yet, when I try to express this, or convey this to someone, I end up forcing my self to laugh. To make sure no one thinks i'm pissed off. That is a character flaw, I'll be the first to admit that. But the fact that no one can look past my smile and think, "hmm, maybe Bryan is a tad pissed right now, maybe he's deeper than that". Nope, i'm just a candy coated person, candy on the outside, happy crap on the inside. Sonsofbitches  Secondly is the fact that i'll probably never find someone who matches me. Someone who I'd actually want to create my legacy with. I have yet to meet (almost spelled meat) a girl who meets my strict requirements. And you know what, who cares if they are dreadfully strict, that's the reason people get so many divorces, because they fuck someone and need to get married, or want to fuck someone so get married. I want to find my perfect fit, i dont want that divorce bullshit. 'Sides, why waste your life on someone who's almost perfect? Fact of the matter is, everyone in tomball, or at least that i've seen, is either a drunken whore, a sex whore, a hang out with people other than me whore, or a all of teh above whore.

".&amp;nbsp; Which really was the case in the bareset sense.&amp;nbsp; I mean seriously she couldn't stay offa a guy, (not me mind you) for more than a second, she'd like jump from guy to guy.&amp;nbsp; It was sad really, that iwent out with her.&amp;nbsp; Now, I think Pam is a fox, and she's very moral, and apparently a genius (first in her class, holy shit).&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, I think she's too, out there, as in out there, out of my arms.&amp;nbsp; So if we did go out, it would be Tiffane' all over again, which I really couldn't bare.&amp;nbsp; I dont like feeling my stomach consume itsself.&amp;nbsp;     I apologize nathan for the lack of hilarity.

Bret and I are very similar.&amp;nbsp; Howevver, he has done me wrong and until he admits that we shall not be on speaking terms.&amp;nbsp; Ben on the other hand was a better friedn than him for a time.&amp;nbsp; but he just acts like a dumb cunt every time i talk to him.&amp;nbsp; And because I know that at one point the two fo them are going to read this and bitch at me, or about me, I"d like to express my confusion.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, they bitcha t and about me because I put this shit online.&amp;nbsp; who gives a flying fuck, I havnt seen any military action taken against them on the behalves of those who read this, that being like 3 or 4 preople on a semi regular basis.&amp;nbsp; Especially when they tell more people about the situation at hand than I do.&amp;nbsp; I think its got danged stupid if you ask me.&amp;nbsp;    Tactics.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, the first one was such a badass game.&amp;nbsp; Ramza was a freaking timemage/knight.&amp;nbsp; Unstopable.&amp;nbsp; The difference betweenn tactics for hte psx and gba is how you roleplya.&amp;nbsp; In the psx version I was Ramza, I played a knight fighting for reasons that I cannot devulge for the sake of Jake who may yet play the game.&amp;nbsp; In the gba version, I play the role of Marche, who is playing the role of somebody playing a final fantasy game.&amp;nbsp; ITs like playing agame about playing a game.&amp;nbsp; and yyes, as nathan pointed out, i dont like it because its not exactly like the original.&amp;nbsp; But damnation, aren' t classics usually better than refurbished versions othings?&amp;nbsp; I dont like the fact that it's practically impossible to level up jobs, and the way you do seems very stupid to me.&amp;nbsp; I dont like the fact that If you heal yoruself, and yo'ure already at full HP, you gain more exp than you do for slaughtering someone in one hit that's one level under you.&amp;nbsp; But do I hate the game?&amp;nbsp; Well, I'll beat it and tell you.&amp;nbsp; DAMNATION!    In conclusion, dont do drugs, or you may end up destroying the universe.    PS. those yearbook pictures are fucking hifuckinglarious...    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Resolved That... - 10/8/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   "Whores are stupid bitches", Because I agree w/ this quote by myself, I affirm the resolution      Resolved That: In the United States social system, Bryan's hating whores ought to take precedence over their need to piss me the fuck off.   I would like to offer some key terms to better clarify the resolution using whatever shit i pull out of my ass.    United States social system : the social system in teh United States    Bryan : what a fucking stud    hating:  the action in which one dislikes    whores : basically someone who pisses me off    precedence : bigger, like a penis, but in regards to standards    need to piss me the fuck off : like PMS, only once a day.&amp;nbsp;   The value on which I will uphold in today's debate is that of  minority rights , that being the right of me, who happens to be a minority of one.   The criterion by which i shall measure this value is that of  stupid bitches piss me off. &amp;nbsp;     Contention I : Tiffane's friend ashlee' is a troll.    Sub point A : According to BT Honeycutt of THS, "seriously, she looks like something out of icewind dale.&amp;nbsp; when the world does change, my party will have to use fire to slay her".&amp;nbsp; According to this entirly&amp;nbsp;legitimate source, we can understand the frustration and whoreocity that is present in any conversation with a whore such as Ashlee'.&amp;nbsp; Thus, to negate the resolution establishes a haven for whores and bitches alike.&amp;nbsp; Affirming the resolution allows for less bitching which detracts from good moods and sexual stimulation.    Contention II : If a fucking rock fell on her fucking head, i'd probably fucking laugh... out loud, with my mouth.    Sub point A : During a recorded conversation between  Sir Bryan  and Ashlee' Troll Chieftan, she began to banter and bryan and discredit his flexibility, " You're so damn literal bryan ", which was soon followed by a statement to Tiffane', " how could you have dated him ?".&amp;nbsp; However, when Sir Bryan calmly tried to shut the crazy bitch up before she unleashed demons upon the land, he was called "rude" and a " jerk ".&amp;nbsp; These statements were used excessivly until the meeting ended roughly 10 minutes later.&amp;nbsp; If the affirmative was in act during this instance, the police would have arrived promptly and arrested this bitch's ass and sent her down to get pounded by some fat dykes in the slammer.&amp;nbsp; Thus, a good result is yeilded for all.&amp;nbsp;    In conclusion, bitches aren't good people, so we should blow them the fuck up.   God Bless America!   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Time to write like Ascaril again... - 10/9/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yes, I feel inclined to over exagerate, overelaborate and adjetiveafy my entry today... who've thunk it?   Today, as Apollo, lord of the sun, rose, with the flaming ball of gas at his back, I realized that in fact the world would indeed change. And yet, my intuition dictated that in order to fully establish this change, it would have to be I that changed with it. Thus, I charged my friend Jake with the task of finding a book of wizardry for the transformation, and then to search and find for me a pack of gum, because I had not brushed my teeth that day. Truly, 2 different plans of action were necessary to establish a basis for the intricate ways of elaborating the ultra greatness of my grand design.   When making a comparison between two similar beings, the first entity being Kikku my former employer and demon of Quiznazi's, the second, my demi-manager of the rib tickler, Gail. Both of which possess feats which constitute them as MICROMANAGERS!   shit, I'm giving up, writing like Jake is like tearing off one of my nipples   No joke, working around Gail is like having a freaking nut sucking tick floating above your head, watching your every move. Here's an exaggerated scenario, simply because I cant remember that much, mostly because I block out stupid people when I can.   Scenario I: A person pulls up to the window and I start reading them their order... Gail, "umm... umm, what's your name? Jesse, you need to read back their order."   Me: "thanks gail"   Gail: "okay, Francisco, don't be sure to take their money, and after you take their money, you should put it in the register, and after that, give them back their change, but close the register after you've gotten the change out."   at about this point the person has gotten his/her food and driven off.   Gail: "so Charles, did you give them their food?"   Bryan: "no, in fact I told them to just drive around for a few minutes, just to burn up some gas"   Gail: "Christ Rochester, did you even remember to vibrate your vocal cords in syncronicis with your tongue and mouth movements thus vocally communicating this message to them?"   Bryan: "Shit, must have slipped my mind!"   Gail: "Don't swear Donald!"   Raul then walks by slappin his dick around and says, "hey you stupid dumb cunt dumbass bitch fucking, how about you go eat some dicks and shoot up some crack. Hey Gail, fuck you."   Gail: "oh Raul, you're so funny, you should really give... *whispers* what's this kid's name?"   Raul: "... Bryan"   Gail: "right, give Teddy some tips on humor next time you see him."   Bryan: "I'm right here!"   Gail: "shut up Cletus!, us grown ups are having us ourselves a civimalized conversation!"   Yeah, I'm really waiting to find out she's behind me when I'm taking a piss instructing me to drop my drawers and piss in the toilet. What a fucking bitch!   8 nickels jayci... 8 nickels  "Enough strength can defeat anything, even death", Unknown  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Athens: A.K.A. Stupid Dick Head Land... - 10/10/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  During a conversation with my mom today, I came to the realization that democracy only works if there are smart people voting.&amp;nbsp; No, this won't be a political bitching... yet.&amp;nbsp; I can't remember a time in the past that I was stuck in a smart group.&amp;nbsp; I swear, if I get stuck doing a group project, it's with a bunch of dumb fucks who can't tell the difference between their balls... and some other unrelated thing.&amp;nbsp; Let me give you a good example.&amp;nbsp; For some irrelavent reason, at religious ed (which I hate to begin at to begin with) I was put in a group that's supposed to make the tallest free standing tower out of 4 cups and about a hundred straws.&amp;nbsp; I immediatly figure it would be best to have an eiffle tower design, or at least something with stable support.&amp;nbsp; but no, the overwhelmingly stupid majority votes on the moronic idea to simply tape the straws together, end to end.&amp;nbsp; Now, i'm not a genius, but I initally assumed that their tower of cock eaters would fall over after about 3 straws.&amp;nbsp; After expressing my concerns, they immediatly called ME a dumbass and began constructing their tower of idiocy.&amp;nbsp;    Obviously I distance myself from the horde of inbred morons to try and scrap together what support for the tower that I can.&amp;nbsp; I hate idiots, but i hate losing even more.&amp;nbsp; After about ten minutes of the ass savages' passing around dip and connecting straws together with the remaninder of their eight brain cells, they approach me and say, " what's that, a rocket ship? ".&amp;nbsp; I reply, " well, obviously not, as you can see there is no rocketry associated with this construction, and I doubt if there was, straws would be suitable for flight ."&amp;nbsp; After contemplating what I just said for a few seconds, they then steal the remainder of my straws and declare, " stop speaking your chinese and help us with this !"&amp;nbsp; They then melt down my creation and form a plastic calf (reference to the israelites after their exodus from egypt)    Eventually the simians evolve and decide that they can get the tower taller by attatching more straws while standing on a chair.&amp;nbsp; So, if you can picture this, an eight foot tall tower of straws, connected end to end only standing because someone is holding it at the top.&amp;nbsp; Then, a lightbulb flickers in one of their heads and they determine that adding more duct tape to the straws will only bolster it's strength and keep it from falling.&amp;nbsp; All the while, my head is tucked in my hands as I'm crying in sorrow for the human race.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind, I am the stupid one.    Well, as the judge people come to determine who's is the tallest, the ape on the chair lets go of the structure's top, fairly confident in his exploits.&amp;nbsp; It was like watching 9/11 all over again.&amp;nbsp; Not only did the structure fall, but the straws all broke off and left a heap of rubble in its wake.&amp;nbsp; Damn Bin Laden.&amp;nbsp; Sons of bitches.&amp;nbsp;    I will close with a reference to the Simpsons.&amp;nbsp; Homer and several other's have dug a hole in hopes of finding treasure.&amp;nbsp; After about 6 hours of digging, they are verticle hole about 20 feet down in the earth.&amp;nbsp; Chief Wiggum asks, "well, how are we going to get out of this hole?"&amp;nbsp; Homer exclaims rather proud of himself, "We'll DIG OUR WAY OUT!".&amp;nbsp; The group then continues to dig down.&amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp;     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Might as well put some poop in those pants... - 10/11/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I just went over my first three diary entries, almost 2 full years ago.&amp;nbsp; I came to the realization that despite some drastic changes in my way of verbally expressing myself, "yo yo bitch, come get some of this suga'!"&amp;nbsp; Very little has changed in my life.&amp;nbsp; I guess that's good.&amp;nbsp; But for the whole "to screw or not to screw thing".&amp;nbsp; Seriously, I'm at the same damn crossroads that I was on december 2001!.&amp;nbsp; Tiffane' was a church girl and all bitchey and shit.&amp;nbsp; See that didnt work, and I'm just terrible at hitting on people.&amp;nbsp; So that doesnt work.&amp;nbsp; i'm going to become a damn priest!&amp;nbsp;    OH WAIT!!!&amp;nbsp; I guess I did ask Kaitlyn to homecoming.&amp;nbsp; Disregarding the fact that I got turned down for some other guy, failed to remember his name, I still worked up the juevos to ask her to her face!. &amp;nbsp;So off on yet another tangent.&amp;nbsp; Looks like captain ME isnt going to homecoming again this year.&amp;nbsp; Two years in a row, turned down for either a group of freshman, or some other guy.&amp;nbsp; How disconcerting!&amp;nbsp;    If you're wondering about the seemingly irrelavent title, it has to do w/ shitting your pants.&amp;nbsp; Just a little FYI.    In conclusion, apparently now everyone I have ever met EVER has found this diary, i must either be special, really loud, or just a badass.&amp;nbsp; Probably a combination of NONE OF THOSE!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH... - 10/14/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I determined something&amp;nbsp;as i got out my car after youth group which Jayci begged me to go to.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, I thought you'd bring up a roman tacking again, that just might not go over well with the rest of the parish.&amp;nbsp; I like to think of myself as a sooth sayer.&amp;nbsp; honostly, I can see myself 7 years from now on a damn cloud laughing about how I was right about my death in ten years prediction.&amp;nbsp; I could have died the most painful death ever and I'd just be like, "YOU LOSE NATHAN, SHANNON, BEN AND WHOEVER ELSE DEFIED MY WISDOM!!".&amp;nbsp; Who seriously could not see me doing that, I for damn sure could.&amp;nbsp; I guess its just a part of me, to always have to be right, and if i'm not right, I love technicalities.&amp;nbsp; three brief points followed by some big schpeal... not that those aren't commonplace or anything.    Way to fuck up the getting a magical world chaging book and my pack of gum you two.&amp;nbsp; what kind of friends are you?&amp;nbsp; shitty ones.&amp;nbsp; that's the kind.    I would most likely laugh seeing austen set ablaze.    i should disrobe around 'Left' more often. tee hee.    Well, nathril's bitchin about how his friends are getting shit faced again.&amp;nbsp; pardon me for being an asshole, but I dont think Paul (try and guess who that is and how i came to that name) is that great of a friend if you ask me.&amp;nbsp; He tells nathril he's stupid for debating non-critical things.&amp;nbsp; what is there to debate about if not for utter shit?&amp;nbsp; Pssh, what's critical in this world anyway, who determines what is and isnt essential?&amp;nbsp; And secondly, Nathril and I played tactics in Wendell's class the other day, he just sat back and laughed at us.&amp;nbsp; Bastard Paul is a&amp;nbsp;closet gamer.&amp;nbsp; which is what&amp;nbsp;i hate, ignoring someone who you get along with only to climb the social ladder.&amp;nbsp; Ironically enough, i"m tying contentment into this.&amp;nbsp; I'm content with the friends I have.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be a guy with a black lady dance questioning his sexuality, or a busty brunette who can't help being perpetually blasphemous.&amp;nbsp; And even the person who defines capriciousness.&amp;nbsp; i love my friends adn i'm happy to have them.&amp;nbsp;    Whoever can not only guess who Left is but how I came th that name gets 2 dollars.         God   bless   America !     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Xylothin the crooked sword... - 10/21/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have determined that I am the odd man out.&amp;nbsp; It is always nate and jake, ben and bret, cris and taylor, jayci and everyone else.&amp;nbsp; Bryan and who then?&amp;nbsp; I suppose this has been true since my earliest years.&amp;nbsp; I was always with the reject or five leged person when we wetn on field trips.&amp;nbsp; I truly don't understand what's going to happen when I get older.&amp;nbsp; Greg has Roger, they helped each other move into their new apartments.&amp;nbsp; Who the hell do I have?&amp;nbsp; I always said I valued a close friendship over a hundred mediocre ones, but how many close friendships do I actually have, that has been troubling me for the last few days.&amp;nbsp;    Today I discovered that my affection for Kaitlyn is simply a crush.&amp;nbsp; nothing more.&amp;nbsp; I used to think she'd change, stop drinking, stop all of that.&amp;nbsp; I also thought her past was a relativly clean slate.&amp;nbsp; Neither seem to be true.&amp;nbsp; She told me she'd stop drinking, she didn't.&amp;nbsp; Plus, I just can't seem to talk to her.&amp;nbsp; I may get in a few minutes of conversation, and then it dies.&amp;nbsp; We are just two different people, i'm a crazy ass gamer with no respect for alchoholism, and she's a partying person who... doesn't game?&amp;nbsp; Moral of the story is, Bryan's gonna have to try harder to find someone.&amp;nbsp;    A dark shadow has seemed to come over Nate as of recent.&amp;nbsp; I'm sorry, but he's just being an asshole.&amp;nbsp; Something is different, obviously, i'm not aware of all the circumstances, but something drastic has changed about him.&amp;nbsp; It's not even like he's more evil today (PA reference), there's just something different in his eyes.&amp;nbsp; In a related story, he complained that I call him fickle because of his constant changing.&amp;nbsp; And followed up about the vile nature of stagnation.&amp;nbsp; I realize now that fickle is not the word to describe his predicament.&amp;nbsp;    Discontentment.    I am content, therefore I see little reason to constantly change, to need to see new faces, to fall in love with new video games.&amp;nbsp; Nate on the other hand just isn't content in my opinion.&amp;nbsp; That is why his mind changes frequently.&amp;nbsp; It's like ADD i suppose.&amp;nbsp; He just won't commit to something unless it's a 100%, God's blessing sure thing.&amp;nbsp; Which is why I doubt 6 nuts will actually ever come into existance.&amp;nbsp; I reason&amp;nbsp;the word discontentment because he told me he'd flaunt his wealth God willing he obtains it.&amp;nbsp; I can honostly say, if I can support myself, a family and my gaming addiction, I am content.&amp;nbsp; If I dont have to count every penny to keep out of debtors prison, I'd be fine with that.&amp;nbsp;    Jake can make me laugh like no one else can, understands my animeism and gameism, but we just dont communicate about other things enough, in all honosty, I'd really like to.&amp;nbsp; But then again, it's jake and nathan.    Bret goes to netzone with me, he's the only one other than johnny who has.&amp;nbsp; but then again, it's bret and ben    Ben, like jake, can make me laugh hystarically, but it&amp;nbsp;really kills me that he's at a level in speaking that I could only dream of.&amp;nbsp; but then again, it's ben and bret    Jayci, she's damn funny, i really enjoy talking to her, but then again, its jayci and TOMBALL!    Nathan argues with me, and is always wrong, but he tries to put up a fight, but then again, it's nathan, jake, audy and the populars.     Greg, my brother is a badass.&amp;nbsp; I miss him a whole lot.&amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  My goals, circa whatever time it is... - 10/21/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Within about ten years I hope to&amp;nbsp;have:    ...Beautiful and caring wife.    ...2 male children, four years apart, (David Gregory Honeycutt, Jacob Timothy Honeycutt)    ...A steady job, my current objectives are head of "6 Nuts", "Bryan's BBQ", or something that pays well for minimal work.    ...Enough gaming to defeat anything, even death...    ...A massive collection of anime and games.    ...The collection of games I have currently, NOT SELLING A DAMN THING... except for minority report    ...An able computer    ...STARCRAFT!!!    ...reached puberty... haha, i'm joking, that's setting my aims to high.    ...a house, meh, apartment would be good to.&amp;nbsp; Shit, i'll settle for a non-box    ...a college education    ...someone to argue w/, need to sharpen my mind every now and again.    &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Call Upon Holy Might... - 10/21/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  There are three games that I believe are&amp;nbsp;a direct result of God almighty, maker of heaven and earth.&amp;nbsp; StarCraft, Harvestmoon (64 specifically) and Final Fantasy 7.&amp;nbsp; Ignoring the need to sleep, maintain my health, go to school, work or anything else, I could easily play those games in cycles for the rest of my natural life.&amp;nbsp; I will go into great orgasmic detail as of to why I love these games so much.&amp;nbsp; (thus, i will be writing the descriptions about 30 minutes apart from each other.)    StarCraft:    No other RTS game that I've played (WC3, Red Alert, command and conqure, CivIII) have I felt the conflict absolute.&amp;nbsp; 3 utterly different races of people, and yet they were connected by conflict.&amp;nbsp; It always pains me when I see my forces destroyed in a flash by my opponent.&amp;nbsp; Firstly because my military is weakened by the loss, but also because I sent men into the fray simply to die.&amp;nbsp; I know they're just 0's and 1's, but the concept is just... raw emotion.    Harvest Moon 64:    HOLY SHIT, that was my first "up 'til 5 am game".&amp;nbsp; Really the concept is stupid, playing a fucking farm boy, how boring.&amp;nbsp; But no, it's so addicting its like coke or something.&amp;nbsp; And getting up the next morning to your wife and possibly child with about tenthousand more gold in your bank is always satisfying.&amp;nbsp; Its the closest thing to reality for me.&amp;nbsp; what a great life it is to farm, get a wife, and make money, simplistic, and fun.    Final Fantasy 7:    Let me explain the circumstances udner which I first found this game, played it, and why it's hte fucking greatest.&amp;nbsp; In about 5th grade I saw the&amp;nbsp; TV commercial for 7, my eyes almost watered at the graphical leaps that the PlayStation had made with the cutscenes.&amp;nbsp; Even with the brief, 20 second commercial, I knew this game was pouring with feeling.&amp;nbsp; I distinctly recall several of the scenes.&amp;nbsp; Where a spikey yellow haired man gently laid down what seemed like his companion in a lake.&amp;nbsp; The scene where a sinister, grey haired fiend turns his head with cold, blue eyes.&amp;nbsp; And most memorably, where that yellow haired guy was riding a bike fighting off baddies.&amp;nbsp; I knew that FF7 and I were destined for each other.&amp;nbsp; It may be sick describing a game like I&amp;nbsp;would my wife, but in all honosty, that's how I felt, something higher than any human, or japan created a bond between this game and I.&amp;nbsp; I bought a PSX and ff7, but unfortunatly I got in a fight w/ my mom shortly thereafter and they were hidden from me.&amp;nbsp; During one of my usual quests to find my lost CD case, i came across the PSX with 7 in the system, in a location&amp;nbsp; easily accessable.&amp;nbsp; So every night of my Freshman year, after my parents went to bed at around midnight, I snuck into that room, brought it back to my room, and played 7 until about 3 am.&amp;nbsp; I would sneak back, put it where it once was and go back to bed.&amp;nbsp; Those were easily my happiest moments of high school to date.&amp;nbsp;    I dont know why, but recently my pride in gaming has been bolstered several fold as of recent, perhaps because of my purchasing of a GBASP and GC.&amp;nbsp; Let us all bless Jake who is now playing ff7, what a damn fine game.&amp;nbsp;     Jayci, that meant a lot to me btw.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Empathy... - 10/24/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I suppose I have had this trait for quite some time, and yet have only told my mother. It's a more combination of peity and empathy.  I work at Rib Tickler. I make about 150 dollars in 2 weeks, which isnt that bad in the grand scheme of things. I come to work with a smile on my face, but frankly, the only thing that I pay for is gaming and gas. There is no necessity to my working, nor urgency. There is no one I'm supporting, I dont have to take care of anyone. My rent is paid for by my parents. as a result of these two things, I rarely fiddle with my bank statements or balance my checkbook. On the other hand, I see people working at places like randals or McDonalds who are my parents age, and chances are they have a family to support. They always have a smile on their face, are always working hard at what they do, because how they act at work determines whether or not their kids can get into college. I peity them.  The fact that I am so fucking lucky. The fact that my parents dont have to count pennies (though my mom does). The fact that I can go to bed with alot of possesions in my room, more and more of which I am paying for. I can drive a nice car. But the thing is, I dont even recognize this very often. Now, the theory behind adults working low salary jobs is that they didnt try hard in high school and so they are getting repremanded. But fact of the matter is, some people did try hard, but they just didnt have the brain power.  Every two months or so, I'm plauged by this crippling fear that I will grow up and be like those people at randals. Not because I dont have the capacity, shit, I think circles around 75% of the people ahead of me in the class, but I just dont have the will. I suppose the one way I remedy this fear is that no matter what I make, I shall raise my children as such: They will be raised with respect, "yes sir, no ma'am". They will be raised to think and reason, if David or jake turn out jocks, so be it, but they will be smart jocks. They will be raised to understand that conformity does not hail ignorance, but that it is a human trait (the moment david or jake start showing signs of gothism, or what i consider to be gothic, i will abandon them, and start anew).  Back on topic. I have this peity, the feeling is a lesser level of my heartbreak pain. It's just that crushing pain in the stomach, the one that only goes away with a good laugh. I peity not because I fear I am going to become a poorly paid father. I peity because most of the people were put in that situation by God, and still come to work every day, glad to work, glad to know that they can support their children.  I'm left having finished this entry rather contemplative. I envisioned as I began writing it that when everyone read this they'd be shocked. I'm a bastard, I swear, take the Lord's name in vain, offend people regularly, and I'm usually ignorant to others' feelings. To hide this i laugh, and get people to laugh with me. No one really understands when I'm serious, which is why people are shocked when I'm quiet, they always thing i'm upset. Sometimes, I'm just left thinking.  Blessed are those who show mercy...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Betrayer of the Light... - 10/25/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am not a man of fear.&amp;nbsp; I live my life without having to scream like a little girl over little things.&amp;nbsp; I can ride with someone driving recklessly, watch swarms of bees hover over my head.&amp;nbsp; Yet, there is a creature on this earth so vile, so corrupt, that I quiver before it.&amp;nbsp; The Roach.&amp;nbsp; It is in my opinion that the Roach is directly spawned from satan's ass.&amp;nbsp; He was probably sitting atop his throne of mangled corpses scratching his chin thinking, "what creature could I conjure up evil enough to stave off those blasted archeangles".&amp;nbsp; If Tyreal and the average roach fought, the roach would come out victorious.&amp;nbsp; My fear of them is so obscenly stupid that I almost always run out of my room, arms flailing about in the air, swearing profanities left and right.&amp;nbsp; As I make it downstairs to the can of Raid, my father insults my "weakness".&amp;nbsp; That man is afuckingfraid of horses... what the hell?&amp;nbsp;    As many of you recall, my last conflict with the scourge was fought in my room, staff and raid in hand, I fought bravely, and defeated the enemy.&amp;nbsp; Now, with a half empty can of raid from the last struggle in hand, a new enemy has emereged...while this one does not fly... yet, it rivals an ancient black dragon in size.&amp;nbsp; And my wounds have not yet healed from my conflict with Ach-Beck-Tech (Ben named it), the green dragon of Rib Tickler.&amp;nbsp; I now have the advantage now, while i wielded but a stick to the flying scourge, I now have Xylothin at my side.&amp;nbsp; Nothing can stop me.&amp;nbsp; Yet, this creature is sly.&amp;nbsp; Even now, it crawls about, continuing to defile the sanctity of my room.&amp;nbsp; But soon, soon I shall have my vengeance... darkness cannot hide long in the light.&amp;nbsp; And soon, it shall be destroyed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am Roac Wind, Dragon's Bane, slayer of the winged scourge... this shadow of a spawn shall not last long.     God is on my side, I shall claim victory...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Bautha Tan... - 11/4/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Roughly drowish for "dodge this!"    Basically I think that Works Cited is the FUCKING DEVIL!&amp;nbsp; Which brings me to my main topic of discussion tonight.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy writing.&amp;nbsp; Wendell is trying to convince me that&amp;nbsp; I'm a poor writer with the ungodly grades that she's giving me, and perpetual criticism.&amp;nbsp; But quite frankly, I don't care what her opinion on&amp;nbsp; "good writing" is.&amp;nbsp; I may not be a poet, nor a polotician, but I don't believe my writing is half bad, nor do I feel the need for a drastic, if any change at all.&amp;nbsp; I have lots of respect for Wendell though, she's a genius&amp;nbsp; who plays DnD, or did.&amp;nbsp; She differs from CK b/c she's lazy as I am.&amp;nbsp; Though she's obviously brilliant, I do not agree there is one way to write well.&amp;nbsp; Obviously there are ways to write better and writing in ebonics is not an accepted writing style, but one outline to the next really is simply a matter of preference, not superiority.&amp;nbsp;    I told myself this last summer that I need to start writing more.&amp;nbsp; Writing about my little fantasy land I call Hetmal.&amp;nbsp; Just writing short stories about random things.&amp;nbsp; Though I've failed under both of those accounts for the most part, I realized one thing, I write all the time.&amp;nbsp; Hell, I think I'm at about 108 entries right now.&amp;nbsp; This may not be a formal style of writing, nor anything the average human would want to read, but I do write.&amp;nbsp; I write for the sake of being funny, Angsty writes for the sake of being poetic (when he writes), Gabe/Tycho write for the sake of feeling intellectually superior to others.&amp;nbsp;    Another thing I learned is that I can only write under certain circumstances.&amp;nbsp; Writing usually takes a lot out of me, and unless I have something important to yap about, I usually dont.&amp;nbsp; Now, this isn't really a prioriety one document, but it's something that's been on my mind for some time.&amp;nbsp; I guess i write more when I listen to Braveheart's theme, what a badass movie.&amp;nbsp; Writing drains me, and I'm lazy as is.&amp;nbsp;      May you walk in God's footsteps...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Elamshin be done... - 11/4/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Destiny be done..."    Yeah, I guess this is my word of the day drow dictionary.&amp;nbsp; Damn, those crazy ass drow are awesome.    Who here can recall my entry entitled, "A total ass raping cock captain".&amp;nbsp; Well I can, and the situation has improved little.&amp;nbsp; Usually an insult will be thrown at me by him, and I sort of freeze.&amp;nbsp; I can't even utter something to the effect of "Excuse me MISS BITCH", which really isn't that hard.&amp;nbsp; So I sat down and pondered this fear I have, because it's really jacked up.&amp;nbsp; i'm afraid of nothing, save cockroaches... bastards.&amp;nbsp; I finally came to the conclusion that it has nothign to do w/ me thinking Cock Captain is in any way better than me, because he just isnt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He just emmits this aura of arrogance&amp;nbsp; that cries, I'm soo fucking cool.&amp;nbsp; He actually reminds me as my father describes himself as he was when he was in high school.&amp;nbsp; That, "i'm too fucking good for you low class people, let me stick my nose in the air and laugh at you when you speak" attitude.&amp;nbsp; Quite frankly, I'm yearning for the day that I tell that SOB off.&amp;nbsp; But why havn't I yet?    It recently occured to me that I'm in a similar situation that Marche was at his first confrontation with Llendar, his, and my arche nemesis in FFTA.&amp;nbsp; And if you don't want to hear the end of what I considered to be a pathetic storyline, skip a few lines.&amp;nbsp; I'll probably summarize later down.&amp;nbsp; According to overall level and armorments, Marche and Llendar were practically dead even.&amp;nbsp; Yet, Marche was paralyzed, and unable to even raise a sword to him.&amp;nbsp; At the end, when the two finally faced off (in a rather uneventful battle), his invincibility was taken away, and Marche could finally strike him down.&amp;nbsp; That is the situation at hand.&amp;nbsp;    I feel that I cannot raise my voice to Cock Captain so long as I am within D's room.&amp;nbsp; He is what I consider to be, D's little pet.&amp;nbsp; And though she doesn't speak particularly high of him outside of class, she seems to follow his every word during it.&amp;nbsp; So until D permits me to fight back, to raise Xylothin against him, I shall be paralyzed.&amp;nbsp; But when she limits his endless strength, I'll simply have to shrug off his continual slander.      What a dick...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Embodiment of Hatred... - 11/4/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Spectre.&amp;nbsp; According to my fantasy land of Hetmal, they are the most vile of demons.&amp;nbsp; Bodies forged purely of hatred, corruption, and destruction.&amp;nbsp; It seems as though work brings out the absolute worst in me.&amp;nbsp; This week, I was given two opportunities to see the Matrix Revolutions, somethign I've been watiing to see since I heard of its creation.&amp;nbsp; Twice, I have been thwarted by&amp;nbsp;my workplace.&amp;nbsp; I try to get off for Wednesday, but heather and jacob, the only other two people on earth who can work drive through, feel the call from God to go to church twice every week.&amp;nbsp; Fine and dandy, but because of work I havn't been to church in 3 weeks.&amp;nbsp;  I am having trouble containing this adamant feeling of utter contempt I hold for not only Jacob and Heather right now, but also my employers .&amp;nbsp; The second time, Friday, seems is another day that Jacob needs off, probably to go on some personal quest, quite frankly, I do not care what the specific reason is, however, I do know it is not life threatening, nor religiously based.&amp;nbsp; He chooses to not let me off because I want both Wednesday and Friday off for personal reasons.&amp;nbsp; Totally understandable.&amp;nbsp; But bear in mind, not just a week ago he asked me to take time out of my debate meeting, a school related activity, so that he could go on a date.&amp;nbsp; I consider that to be a rather personal reason.&amp;nbsp; But did I say, "no jacob, I need want to stay and work, or just hang out w/ my friends",&amp;nbsp; I said, "yeah man, when do you need me to drop by".&amp;nbsp; A rather noble act I might say.&amp;nbsp;  Nobility is a lost art in this era .&amp;nbsp; Obviously my utter hatred for Rib Tickler now is not spawned directly from this recent action.&amp;nbsp; Oh no, it goes much further back.&amp;nbsp; I work Drive Through.&amp;nbsp; I can honostly say that it is much harder than any other position in that resturaunt.&amp;nbsp; No one denies it.&amp;nbsp; I'm not mad out of pride, I dont have a high school education, where could I have pride.&amp;nbsp; I'm not mad because I'm lazy, I always have a smile on my face when I'm working, I try to make the customers laugh.&amp;nbsp; I am mad however, because though I work harder than call ins, and line cashier put together, I still get paid the same wage.&amp;nbsp; Now, that may be partially superficial.&amp;nbsp; But drive through is nothing like any of the other stations.&amp;nbsp; It is essentially cut off from human contact.&amp;nbsp; It's on the other side of rib tickler, and if I dare leave my station, I'm liable to be attacked by Sylvia, or Gail who just now learned my name starts with a 'B'.&amp;nbsp; Drive through works alone, I dont have someone I can ask to spot me while I go to the bathroom.&amp;nbsp; And ironically enough, Drive through is fartherst away from the bathroom.&amp;nbsp; And if I&amp;nbsp;even consider asking someone from call ins to work my station while I use the bathroom, opposed to excreting my waste all over the floor,&amp;nbsp;one of two things will happen.&amp;nbsp; I'll get out of the bathroom, having realized that the person did not go to Drive Through and I now have a line [of cars], or Sylvia will yell at me for distracting another employee from their duties.&amp;nbsp; I guess I should just let it go on the floor next time.&amp;nbsp; No one understands&amp;nbsp; the situation I'm in.&amp;nbsp; My mother just ignores me when I'm complaining (usually with great vulgarity), my father doesn't even pretend to listen, and Greg, God bless him, doesn't quite understand the complexity of it.&amp;nbsp; And when heather and I were friends, she would never come visit the lone wolf.&amp;nbsp; I hated Quizno's because my boss was a micromanaging, penny-pinching, tightwad.&amp;nbsp; I loathe Rib Tickler because I simply am not given due compensation for my actions.&amp;nbsp; I get 5.50, jake and heather get 6.50...    &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My God... It's full of stars... - 11/6/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   THE MATRIX WAS FUCKING HOT, GO SEE IT OR DIE!!!   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Because I choose to... - 11/10/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  REgarding the philosophy behind the matrix nd why I think it's a badass movie...    Need to downlaod NAvras to complete my thoughts    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Attention all primates/or subhumans... - 11/16/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  As I have undoubtably mentioned, EVERYONE, who enters the rib Tickler's drive thru, is in fact, a fucking moron.&amp;nbsp; In an attempt to hinder my belief in God, Lucifer conjures up the most thick headed people and sends them to meet me, blade to blade.&amp;nbsp; Let me give you a little conversation of exactly what happens, it becomes more exagerated as the convo wears on:    Lady:, "yes, I was wondering how exactly you sold bannana pudding"    Me:, "well ma'am, we sell it by the side, like the little cup thing"    Lady:, "Yes, so how much would a tray of pudding be?"    Me:, "um... nothing, because we dont sell it by the tray"    Lady:, "do you have any specials on like, if I wanted to buy two trays?"    Me:, "Ma'am, maybe you don't understand, WE DONT SELL THEM IN TRAYS!"    Lady:, "I'm sorry, you must have cut after the 'we dont sell them in trays', what was teh price again?"    Me:, "FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST!,&amp;nbsp; IT IS NOT THAT COMPLICATED OF A CONCEPT, TRAYS ARE NOT OUR METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING BANNANAFUCKINGPUDDING".    Lady:, "Could you add a second tray to that please, I suppose my husband might want one to"    Me:, "YOU SHOULD ALSO ORDER HIM A SLAB OF FUCKING STUPID BITCH WIFE, OH WAIT, YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE, THAT BEING YOURSELF!!!"    Lady:, "I'll have two trays of those please."    I swear, now I know how those people who teach special ed feel, no&amp;nbsp;wait, because the mentally disabled are capable of NOT BEING STUPID ASSES!&amp;nbsp; A better analogy to those drive thru people is something like, a retarded dog, whos' head was run over by a tractor, though its still alive, it has no ability to think and or reason, the only function the brain serves is to keep its battered and mangled corpse alive.&amp;nbsp; These people are infact, the unfucking dead.&amp;nbsp; Here's another good example, though I actually had fun w/ this lady:    Lady2:, "Yes, I'd like the catfish basket.&amp;nbsp; say, what comes with that?"    Me:, "Let's see, fries and hush puppies, is that okay?"    Lady2:, "Hmm, is catfish on that also?"    Me:, "... no, in fact, the catfish basket is not infact an actual basket, what we do is, charge you for money and give you fries and hush puppies.&amp;nbsp; why on earth would you assume the catfish basket had catfish?"    Or how about this one.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind, there are three types of potatoes, plain: NOTHING on them, Reg: everything BUT meat, Meat: everything and meat.&amp;nbsp; Plain potatoes cost significantly less:    Lady3:, "yes, I'd like&amp;nbsp;one meat potatoe, with no meat, everything else on it.&amp;nbsp; One plain potatoe with butter only.&amp;nbsp; And a regular potatoe with everything on it, except for butter cheese or sour cream."    Me:, "So you had a regular potatoe, no meat.&amp;nbsp; a regular potatoe with butter only, and a regular potatoe with only bacon bits, and chives?"    Lady 3:, "NO!&amp;nbsp; didn't you pay attention?&amp;nbsp; I said, *repeats order*"    Bear in mind, all this time, fucking long lines are accumulating while these stupid fuckheads are trying to dig a hole into their asscrack.&amp;nbsp; Another thing i hate about drive thru is that EVERYTIME, someone orders a shit load of fried food, and behind them is someone with like, a glass of water or something easily made.&amp;nbsp; So the line backs all the fucking way out to my house, eight miles away, and in comes sylvia:    Sylvia:, "Bryan, you've got a line out to walmart, get to work!"    Me: "yes sylvia, let me simply wave my hand over the hordes of cars and simply wish them away."    Sylvia:, "why didnt you do that earlier?"    Or while I'm busting my ass trying to fumble these orders around, Sarah is over at call ins with ben and heather, all three of them are trying to see who can work the least.&amp;nbsp; I'm running through the kitchen to tell Alberto to do something different with a certain order, (and unlesss I do this, i'll get bitched at), enter gail:    Gail:, "Where are you supposed to be [random name that isnt bryan]?" *she has in absolute seriousness, said that EVERY time I've been more than a foot away from the 'drive thru box'    Me:, "well, because I need to tell Alberto about this order, right here"    Gail:, "why aren't you wrapping onions Dillin?"    Me:, "BECAUSE I HAVE A LONG LINE AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 'CALL INS' JOB!!!"    Gail:, "well then why aren't they doing it?"    Me:, "BECAUSE THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING!!!&amp;nbsp; I DONT EVEN SEE WHY YOU PAY THAT DAMNDABLE POSITION"    Gail:, "why aren't you at drive thru, you've got people?"    Me:, "YOU WERE INTEROGATING ME!" *walks back to drive through*    Gail:, "hey felix, I was talking to you!,&amp;nbsp; that asshole never listens to me"    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  A story of Fong, and his tiny dong... - 11/22/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   The Plan:  Jake, Bret and I were to quest off to Netzone, and let off some of my fury in the deaths of counter terrorists. (basically playing CS).&amp;nbsp; After an hours worth of gaming, we'd probably go do something, like go home or something.&amp;nbsp; That was our initial plan... how twisted our initial aim became. (that rhymed)     The Execution of our plan:  After a stress relieving boxing match with Danny outside rib tickler, Bret and I roundevouxed with Jake in the Khols parking lot.&amp;nbsp; All three of us boarded Bret's massive truck and rode into the evening listening to asian music.&amp;nbsp; (oooh yeah!).&amp;nbsp; We reached our destination.&amp;nbsp; Netzone.&amp;nbsp; All three of us entered, I of course was far more giddy than the rest.&amp;nbsp; Shit, i'm just giddy all the time.&amp;nbsp; I bounced around, having seen glenn and Kyle, after touching their shoulders, I went on to barely touch another random guy's shoulder and proclaimed, "I touched a nerd".&amp;nbsp; After touching jake's arm with my 'nerd' hand, he backed away and said, "ew, you got nerd on me".&amp;nbsp;    Then, out of the absolute darkness emerged a foul beast, known only as 'Fong'.&amp;nbsp; The poorly dressed, and yet well built asian man shouted, "I Tend this flock, and for your actions against them, you shall be banished from NETZONE!".&amp;nbsp; My party and I clearly thought he was joking,&amp;nbsp; I mean shit, we were planning on playing video games and shit.&amp;nbsp; But no, the antagonist clearly had the will to expell my noble party from his demonic realm.&amp;nbsp;    "If thy party hast not fled before 15 seconds have passed, thy asses shalt be kick'd", Fong continued to bellow.&amp;nbsp; Yet again, I stepped up to try and defend myself, and yet, to no avail.&amp;nbsp; He began counting, until finally my party felt it necessary to take leave.&amp;nbsp; We exited, confused at first.&amp;nbsp; How could he just kick us out?&amp;nbsp; We were fixing to pay, (and I was fixing to have bret pay for me).&amp;nbsp; I tried to return, but the gate to hell was blocked by Fong's hulking body, it was as though a dark curse fell over the lands (plus the netzone windows were tinted).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    My party soon sat down, one block shy of Netzone to attempt to throw together some plan of attack.&amp;nbsp; Soon, the two men I recognized, followed out through the gate, apparently unscathed.&amp;nbsp; The table at which we sat soon burst into endless rhetoric and meaningless talk.&amp;nbsp; Soon, I grew weary, and felt inclined to purchase an hour of gaming.&amp;nbsp; I marched over to the gates of hell, thankfully Fong's enchantments had worn off, and he had moved away.&amp;nbsp; So I entered.    Fong: "Get the fuck outa here before I kick your ass"    The Weilder of Xylothin: "I would like to purchase one hour of gaming"    Fong: "no"    TWoX: "Well then get behind hte counter and give me an hour... I have money (sort of a lie)"    Fong: "no"    TWoX: "Look, I am willing to pay for this institution's services, this is terrible customer service"    Fong: "That's it"    The Light's Scorn then grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the ground, and proceeded to say    "Get out of my store!"    TWoX: "How can I get out if you're on top of me"    This took the beast a few minutes to ponder, obviously a sayin third class.&amp;nbsp; He then lifted me up and literally shoved me through the gate once more.&amp;nbsp; Battered and defeated, I returned to my friends.&amp;nbsp; We continued to converse about the recent battle, and how we might gain access.&amp;nbsp; Several times Holy's Bane emerged from the gate, shooting at my party of 4 the middle finger.&amp;nbsp; And then, after ten or so minutes, Fong, master of evil, seeming managed to conjure up a Perverted BlackGuard (cop mad at us).&amp;nbsp; He approached us and stated how we (Jake, bret, glenn, Kyle and myself) are no longer allowed in Netzone.&amp;nbsp; Ever.&amp;nbsp; I tried to explain how the four of them, specifically glenn and kyle, had NOTHING to do with anything.&amp;nbsp; But Fong's perversion bore deep into the BlackGuard's mind.&amp;nbsp; It was constrewed that my party was infact on a mission to purge Netzone of its sanctity.&amp;nbsp; If only they knew how much we gamed... if only.     The Aftermath:  After we heard that we were considered, 'troublemakers', it hit me.&amp;nbsp; we looked like a bunch of jocks coming in to make fun of nerds.&amp;nbsp; Which really makes me laugh, seeing as how I first labled the nerds of tomball.&amp;nbsp; Apparently now, on Monday I need to call the actual store owner to explain the situation from my side, which I belive I shall handle rather well.&amp;nbsp; (despite what jake and bret think).&amp;nbsp; Oh, also after the blackguard left, some 14 year old chicks started hitting on us.&amp;nbsp; Now we understand what its like to be one of those sexy convicts.&amp;nbsp; Hoo ah!&amp;nbsp; Oh, one touched bret's ass allegedly.&amp;nbsp;     Justice shall prevail... Xylothin shall lead me to victory!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  i love nathan... - 11/30/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  my inspiration is KERSPLAT right now.&amp;nbsp; i'm only logging to appease nate who's sending me navras right now.&amp;nbsp; what a great man he is right now.    oh, and jake and i held hands for the first time tonight.&amp;nbsp; it was magical.&amp;nbsp; he was playing a tourny in kingdom hearts, got his ass powned so i told him to try the "?????" tournament.&amp;nbsp; He was all bitchin about it and how he had this, "bad feeling".&amp;nbsp; So he reluctantly picked it and from the sky descending a great holy bastion which was Sephiroth.&amp;nbsp; We both saw the great One Winged Angel and&amp;nbsp;were next to speechless.&amp;nbsp; We held hands, and then jake got his ass beat.    end.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  To Confide within... - 12/2/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've really been trouble expressing myself to others lately.&amp;nbsp; I was walking out to my car after work today, and i suppose my brother (who's currently studying for fianls, or watching TV) is the only person I can really talk to about most anything without him bitching at me or making me feel dumb.&amp;nbsp; I suppose that's also why I havnt logged seriously in forever and a day.&amp;nbsp; WHat a great expression.&amp;nbsp; Oh, Back on topic.    Every time I come back to my churc h, I realize how much I dont belong in my youth group.&amp;nbsp; I am the lone wolf.&amp;nbsp; Everyone at POP youth are so similar in thei polar difference to me it makes me feel, alone.&amp;nbsp; Well, probably because I am alone.&amp;nbsp; And though I dont say it to her face, I really wish the troll would just... well, shut the fuck up.&amp;nbsp; that bitch is unrelenting.&amp;nbsp; Going to youth group meetings if sun for the first ten or so minutes.&amp;nbsp; then it just feels so foreign.&amp;nbsp; so unwelcoming.&amp;nbsp; i also realized that Ijust dont give a damn relaly about tiffane' at all.&amp;nbsp; its not so much the time to we spoke, it was just the thought of being able to hold someone.&amp;nbsp; Its a really nice feeling.&amp;nbsp; Not saying anything, not needing to.&amp;nbsp; Just leaning on someone you care about.&amp;nbsp; Its not the person I miss, just the feeling I suppose.&amp;nbsp; Yet again, it was a failed attempt.&amp;nbsp;    I really enjoy being around my friends.&amp;nbsp; they're funny, and have actually adapted to me now.&amp;nbsp; they're not all, "ew, your arm touched my arm".&amp;nbsp; Well, jake's still a little wierd about that face touching thing.&amp;nbsp; homo.&amp;nbsp; haha.&amp;nbsp; I suppose the reason I fear graduating isnt all because I cant work, and I may end up failing in life.&amp;nbsp; Woah, a little hidden fear there I suppose.&amp;nbsp; But its that my friends will just drift away from me.&amp;nbsp; I dont really think I'll stay in touch with more than one or two at best.&amp;nbsp; and even then... damn.&amp;nbsp; I'm just a big fucking bag of emotions right now aren't i?    on a less gay note, I REALLY FUCKING HATE DRIVE THRU!&amp;nbsp; Every thick skulled moron comes through there saying the phrase, "du'wut?" at least twice.&amp;nbsp; To top that off, i'm being bitched at for asking off for a few weeks to do church stuff and crap for debate so I DONT FAIL!&amp;nbsp; This of course is disregarding the fact that Heather and Jake have asked off for EVERY MOTHERFUCKING WEDNESDAY AND SUNDAY!&amp;nbsp; Now, i'm terrible in precal, but I think the days asked off by jake and heather, individually total FIVE BILLION FUCKING MORE TIMES THAN MINE.&amp;nbsp; Plus, I'm cute.      Enough gaming can defeat anything... even death   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Like Pinnochio, but less wood... - 12/14/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I recently resolved to call tiff up and ask why it is she broke up with me.&amp;nbsp; but as most of you know, i'm a pussy, and scared of girls (joobs especially, hey, i'm frightened by tanks of anger!).&amp;nbsp; So finally, after a mind dulling day at the 'rib eats dick and rapes me out of a good pay check', i worked up the nerve to call her, and say, "why is it that you choose to break up with me?"    I went into this also resolving not to argue, just to listen and nod my head.&amp;nbsp; What's done is done.&amp;nbsp; Plus, i'm asking just so i dont butcher a future relationship.&amp;nbsp; Her reasons were: "i'm over analytical", meh, true to a point.&amp;nbsp; I suppose I should have apolgized for having matter between my ears.&amp;nbsp; "i dont'/didnt get along w/ her friends", Shit dawg, Ashlee is a 'look at then vomit' person.&amp;nbsp; can't get along w/ them folk.&amp;nbsp; She then explains to me how her current boyfriend is a tool.&amp;nbsp; damn tools.&amp;nbsp;    So in conclusion, after i got home, i ran up to the bathroom in delight.&amp;nbsp; It seemed that not one, not three, but both of my testicles had descended from my innards.&amp;nbsp; Now I too, am a real boy!&amp;nbsp;      I wish when I lied my wood got longer...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Knockin' on heaven's door... - 12/22/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm going to pick up my brother and father from the airport in a few minutes.&amp;nbsp; They should just be getting off the plane from Washington State.    As you may know, our current terrorism warning level is orange, second highest, and as bad as it was near 9/11.&amp;nbsp;    If you come to find out that a bomb has gone off in Bush International Airport, within an hour or so, either my entire immediate family, or simply brother and father, are dead.&amp;nbsp; If however I come to write an entry following thsi one, either of those may prove to be false.&amp;nbsp; May we all walk in the footsteps of God.&amp;nbsp; May we enter heaven when it calls our name.    And, in my house, is my backpack, near the wooden box i keep my school things.&amp;nbsp; In the small pocket, you will find my journal.&amp;nbsp; Someone must keep it and carry it on.      I shall return... hopefully...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I still draw breath... - 12/23/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Hoo Damn AH!     I did see these two guys get pulled over for going about 90.&amp;nbsp; Sucks to be them!      I have returned...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm a busy man... whore... - 12/23/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've got so much to do nowadays.&amp;nbsp; Work really is screwing over my work schedule.&amp;nbsp; Not only do I have less time to do school work, but I have more money to buy games, which I NEED to play, otherwise I'll kill myself because of work.&amp;nbsp; It's a vicious cycle that excludes school entirly.&amp;nbsp; It's actually rather complicated, I'd draw a graph, but I dont feel like uploading anything right now.    Working = Time, Money, STRESS LIKE A BITCH    Time = -School Work    Money = Video games    STRESS LIKE A BITCH = -school work, +gaming    Therefore, it can be concluded that:    -School work +Video games +gaming -School work = -2 School work + 2 Gaming/games    So basically i'm gaming now twice as much as i would w/o work, and i'm working more than school, so I'm basically going to school only for R n' R.    Now that I've been working, I began buying a shitload of games and systems (i'm planning on randomly buying an XBOX, now there's an oxymoron if i've seen one before).&amp;nbsp; When I was a lot younger, it'd work out like this.&amp;nbsp; Every Chistmas or birthday, i'd get 2 or 3 games MAX, so that's 12 months that revolve around a maximum of 6 games.&amp;nbsp; Now, I think i've bought about 20 Games in the last year ALONE.&amp;nbsp; I'm a gaming whore.&amp;nbsp; I need to write down a list of gaming that needs to be done.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and I was inspired by jake to aquire all the final fantasy games, and i've done pretty well, I just need like 4 more and then my collection will be complete!&amp;nbsp; Save FF8, i shall not wield that demonic game again!&amp;nbsp; Here's my list of FF and CT games.&amp;nbsp; *=owned, ^=Beaten    Final Fantasy*    Final Fantasy II*    Final Fantasy III    Final Fantasy IV*    Final Fantasy V    Final Fantasy VI (remake of III for PS)    Final Fantasy VII*^.... what a heavenly game    Final Fantasy IX    Final Fantasy X*^ (And for the record, i beat X before jake AND nathan, who've had it for far longer)    FF XI (meh, i doubt i'll get it)    Final Fantasy Tactics*    Final Fantasy Tactics Advance*^    Chrono Trigger*^    Chrono Cross*    Shit, I"ve got a lot of gaming to be done.&amp;nbsp; And that doesn't even include Wind waker, Prime, or Sunshine.&amp;nbsp; Shit, I"m gonna have to quit school, work or church.&amp;nbsp; And I can't quit work.&amp;nbsp; In a related topic, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King was such a damn funny movie w/ Jake and Jared (possibly spelled wrong).&amp;nbsp; I felt bad for everyone around us though.&amp;nbsp; we were cracking jokes the WHOLE time.&amp;nbsp; My favorites were:    Samwise finds the elven bread after his fall.&amp;nbsp; "I knew I didnt' eat that!"    Frodo is spun up by the bigass spider.&amp;nbsp; "The End"    Everyone enters Frodo's room.&amp;nbsp; "Peter Jackson (director), is coming out next"    Bilbo gets on the boat. "ITS MRS. EVANS!", Jared    Gandalf on his horse (again) at the top of Minias Tirith.&amp;nbsp; "WHERE DOES THAT HORSE NOT GO???"      I shouldn't be allowed in the movies anymore...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  Lower Xylothin, raise my shield... - 12/23/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I write this entry in retort to the many notes I recieved about how gaming is 'tha devil'.&amp;nbsp; My response to all this is a big fat:     Meh...     We all have our obsessions and quirks.&amp;nbsp; Joobs drinks, Nathan capriciously plays games, Kassie is a LotR fan whore, Jake writes angsty confus-poetry.&amp;nbsp; Are any of these idiosyncricies any more or less bad than the others *cough* drinking *cough*, not necissarily.&amp;nbsp; And most probably, I won't find my companion staving off the dark forces of Bowser, but more importantly, I won't find     my     companion, being someone who I am not.&amp;nbsp; And I have already guessed that Joobs will raise her sword in defense of her drinking, or supposed lackthereof, yet again, to each their own, if you drink, my words should not hinder you, if you love LotR with an unquenchable fervor, let not the Matrix sway your ill logic.&amp;nbsp; I do not advocate changing to any of&amp;nbsp;your ideals to parallel&amp;nbsp;mine, other than that we should walk our own path, vanquish fate, for we are in control of who we are.&amp;nbsp;    Ha, that bullshit sounded really cool.      Stay thy hand Judicater...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Holly Jolly Bitchin'... - 12/25/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  just to get this outa the way...    I got 3 nice shirts, two ties, a tie rack, a new suit (Hoo Ah!), The Matrix Reloaded, Gattaca, The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions movie posters w/ backboard and a necklace.&amp;nbsp; I was pretty damn pleased, my family also liked the stuff I got them.&amp;nbsp; That's what I was excited most about.&amp;nbsp; Ha, I love being able to use my own money to get people crap.&amp;nbsp; Well, not crap, stuff.&amp;nbsp; I got my brother CDRs(he needed) and the Road Warrior (which he likes), and my dad, some beer (which he needs) and Star Trek III (also a necessity).&amp;nbsp; My mom, a written contract for a day of complain-free work, and a cool wooden crucifix, yet another Jesus trinket as my dad says.&amp;nbsp; Merry Damn Christmas!    In a related story, Nathril is arguing now, not for the sake of arguing, not to prove a point, but to be a pill.&amp;nbsp; He expresses to me how I think i'm some gamer god b/c I spend the entirty of my free time gaming.&amp;nbsp; I would disagree with both points.&amp;nbsp; Firstly, because I have not proclaimed to be a god of anykind... yet.&amp;nbsp; And to say i spend the crux of my time gaming, is truly absurd.&amp;nbsp; I don't game nearly as much as I'd like to.&amp;nbsp; How many of you can say they work 3-4 days a week at the stupidest and lowest paying jobs in America?&amp;nbsp; How many&amp;nbsp;of you devote as much time and effort into attending bible study, youth group and other Church functions?&amp;nbsp; No, you people view me as a 2 demensional gamer.&amp;nbsp; Eat, sleep, game.&amp;nbsp; Well, ya'll can eat my balls if that is your depiction of me.&amp;nbsp; I have a fucking hobby.&amp;nbsp; I also write, balance out the insane assholeocity that goes on in my church, WORK FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, and go to school.&amp;nbsp; I'd have to say, for once my schedule is actually pretty busy.&amp;nbsp; If i want to fucking game for hours on end this break, whoopty fucking eat my balls doo.&amp;nbsp; Do I sound adgitated?&amp;nbsp; Who's agitated?&amp;nbsp; I'm just tired of ya'll fuckers thinking you have me figured out.&amp;nbsp; Well here's a happy holidays middle finger out to you!      Merry Christmas Damnit...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Me complain about work, never... - 12/28/2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Every night I come home from work, my mother asks, "well Bryan, who did you work with?".&amp;nbsp;    I look at her with a blank stare, the one a man who recently lost his soul would give.&amp;nbsp; "Well, no one mom, because I'm the only goddamned person in that store who actually works".&amp;nbsp; I then throw off my work shirt, trying to shed the darkness from my hollow corpse, "Ben and heather were getting paid at call-ins though".    This essentially means that Call ins does NOTHING.&amp;nbsp; I'm not one to bitch... regularly, but Call-ins is the most damndable position ever concieved by God or his choir of heavenly angles.&amp;nbsp; It seems that Sylvia has hired ten thousand orcs to fill this single position, and every night, there is at least three people 'getting paid' at call ins.&amp;nbsp; two are trained, one is training.&amp;nbsp; YOU DONT NEED THREE FUCKING PEOPLE WORKING CALL INS.&amp;nbsp; It doesnt make sense.&amp;nbsp; But as the parable of the vineyard tells us, "we should not tell the employer how to distrubute their wealth".&amp;nbsp; Fuck that, i'm tired of running around like my balls were chopped off (makes little sense, i'd be in a fetal position bleeding if my balls were chopped off) while the hordes of Isenguard are jerking off at callins.&amp;nbsp; Nathan is gay.&amp;nbsp; The only problem with gail now knowing my name, is that she now bitches at me more... by name.&amp;nbsp; Meh, you win some you lose some.&amp;nbsp; I'm typically a good natured person, but i'm mostly assured that drive through will be the death of me.&amp;nbsp;     Moron  Guy I: "I'll Have one meat potatoe with EVERYTHING on it... except cheese, butter or sour cream"     Thinks we should know his order out of 8 billion customers  Guy II: "I'll have two barbeques"     Too specific  -Guy III: "I'll have a chopped barbeque briscuit sandwhich, which includes chopped barbeque briscuit, sauce and bread"     Too amfrickinbiguous  -Guy IV: "i'll have a barbeque sandwhich"     Yuna  -Guy V: "Can... you... give me one... chopped... BBQ... sand...........which...............thank-you"     Orders from mars  -GuyVI: " i'll have a sliced beef dinner "     Allows his idiot wife to order from behind the seat, under a pillow  -Guy VII: "mmrph, tjipaf, chopped, fahal, dinner, unngh, ungulate, mafhath..."     Drow  -Guy VIII: "Ussta Quarth?"    Nathan -Guy IX: "YOU HAVE THE BBQ GREATEST EVER, the texture is from the heavens, God must love you..."&amp;nbsp; 20 minutes later, "it's sub par"    little&amp;nbsp;penis&amp;nbsp;jake -Guy X: *with watery eyes* "It's... so beautiful"    Joobs -Gurl XI: "Does it come with a drunkening glass?"    Jason -Guy XII: "I'll have 1and 1/2 pounds of sliced beef with an order of onion rings"    Less gay Ben-GuyXIII: "I'm just coming through the drive through because callins isnt doing anything... surprise!"    Moderate sized balls bret -GuyXIV: "I hope this turkey is buff, witty AND good looking."    Big-Man-Cock Bryan-GuyXV: "I am so cute"    Those last few were personal jokes with my happy names attatched to them.      May we all find someone special, or a cheap whore...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Poor beautiful puss... - 12/30/2003  &nbsp;   Sheesh, provided ben somehow continually finds my diary, he always seems to be pissed off.&amp;nbsp; bitch this, bitch that, woo hoo.&amp;nbsp; haha, actually i do most of the bitching.&amp;nbsp;    This kid is really pissing me off with the string of contradictions.&amp;nbsp; he ranted non-stop about how Caleb got a raise before he did, 'that's totally unfair, i've worked a month longer at callins (whoopty fucking doo).&amp;nbsp;    Then he bitched because heather basically gets to do whatever she wants at work, but though he claims to be a 'drive thru king', he really works it once to the thousands of times at call ins.&amp;nbsp;    And I laugh that he thinks i screwed up at call ins.&amp;nbsp; I never was at call ins, i was supposed to be, but pushed over to DT because sylvia didnt think call ins would get many orders... which comes as a big surprise to me.   He's just mad because i introduce personality to drive thru... holy damn crab... er, crap, i meant holy damn crap.&amp;nbsp; May you all go in the peace of God my friends...    Plus, i'm still mofucking cute...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Simple and Clean... - 1/5/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I believe that love is too strong a word, and a word that is used far more than it should be.&amp;nbsp; I doubt I have been in true love, and I look back to all of the times I've misused that word and cringe.&amp;nbsp; It is like sex, using it more than once diminishes the greatness&amp;nbsp;of the true love.&amp;nbsp; Because of this I shall refer to my current emotion as, attraction.&amp;nbsp; For to say I love her in the level which I hold so high is ignorant to my future love.&amp;nbsp; I love my parents and brother, so I say this same word but not with the same implications, by no means the same meaning.&amp;nbsp;    Typically when I feel attracted to someone, or at least in teh past, it has been little more than a shell, and as consequence, I was incapable of expressing why it is that I had this attraction.&amp;nbsp; This leads me to believe that a great majority of my previous attractions, have been false, nothing more than a hollow exterior that I was attracted to.&amp;nbsp;    But for her it is different, I can easily explain why it is i am attracted to her.&amp;nbsp; She makes me laugh, she's beautiful, she's endlessly smart.&amp;nbsp; I often compare her to a little kitten, as I say, both can put me from a terrible mood to a great one within an instant.&amp;nbsp; My little kitten.&amp;nbsp;    Despite all of these qualities I can list off, there is a dire gap which seperates us.&amp;nbsp; Words fail me when I try to describe it.&amp;nbsp; When I look in her shining eyes and big smile, I notice she doesn't seem to be looking back.&amp;nbsp; Her mind is elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; While I focus one hundred percent on her, she plays with her cell phone, or talks about something totally random.&amp;nbsp; Calling her is just the same, about fifty percent of the words she says are directed towards me.&amp;nbsp; Despite this, I am attracted to her, I'm so damn weak.&amp;nbsp;    There is still a glimmer of hope though, a lone, dwarfed signal that tells me there is more than a thousandth of a chance in hell.&amp;nbsp; And for some reason, I hold tight to that as though it was my crutch.&amp;nbsp; I suppose many think that I am pathetic for this.&amp;nbsp; And I invite you to.&amp;nbsp; Not yet has there been someone I was so attracted to that when they left I would chase after.&amp;nbsp; I know now that when I find someone I do chase after, it will be love.&amp;nbsp;      "Hope, humanities greatest strength, and greatest shortcoming", The Architect...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Dude! Totally! No way... - 1/6/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I once thought that my circle of friends always have these philosophical discussions, filled with deep thought and things of that nature.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, the preps, jocks, etc were limited to conversations that revolved around getting ass, cutting yourself, pumping iron and getting ass once more.&amp;nbsp; While the latter may be quite true, I know full well the former is in fact false.&amp;nbsp;    I am willing to bet at least fifty percent of the conversations I start, begin with one of these phrases:    "Dude, it would be awesome if..."    "The Matrix is  HOT !!!"    "Wouldn't it be crazy if [x girl] and [y girl] started going at it right now!?!?"    "A gift from Jecht... This is your order"    "Sup Joobs..."    No joke, I fear that sometimes I have such meaningless conversations that God will someday restrict my right to verbalize my thoughts.&amp;nbsp; In that event I will spontaneously combust with no outlit for my senselss jabber.&amp;nbsp; No matter, I still maintain that deep thinkers for hte most part only reside within my clique.&amp;nbsp; Which brings me to an excellent point.&amp;nbsp;    Wendell, a damn genius.&amp;nbsp; But damn stuck up.&amp;nbsp; She is fully aware of her intellect and consequently, feels that those with differing opinions, especially in an abstract and therefore undefinable matter, are absolutly wrong.&amp;nbsp;    To make an allusion to Little Penis, she once felt that realism is not a form of artwork because it does not allow for expression.&amp;nbsp; She believed that Romantacism is the true form of art because it allows the artist to express themselves and art has no 'strict definitions'.&amp;nbsp; The paradox lies in teh fact that she defines art as being undefinable.&amp;nbsp; Wendell parallels this by saying, 'some people just don't see poetry, or understand it.&amp;nbsp; But you're still getting a grade for analyzing it'.&amp;nbsp; It is like asking me to translate japanese text.&amp;nbsp; I can appreciate poetry until i bleed, but I for damn sure won't get anything out of it.&amp;nbsp; Call me ignorant, call me a lazy ass, but I just don't see anything.&amp;nbsp; I only understand Jake's entries partly because i know the damn kid.&amp;nbsp; How the fuck am I supposed to know the meaning of shakespeare without having a translator right damn next to me???&amp;nbsp;    In conclusion, I am a fan of writing, not reading... how damn wierd is&amp;nbsp;THAT?      "And miles to go before I sleep, and Miles to go before I sleep...", Robert Frost- Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm a Sorceress... er... Sorcerer, Damnit... - 1/11/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The title is a big inside joke between those i break bread with for lunch.&amp;nbsp;    Basically, this entry will be associated with Dungeons and Dragons, so if you barely understand, it's probably nto my fault this time.&amp;nbsp; Meh, it probably will be anyway.&amp;nbsp; Of the two spell casting classes, you have Wizard and Sorcerer.&amp;nbsp; Wizards are people who study magic books all day and cast spells word for word.&amp;nbsp; BORING!&amp;nbsp; If i wanted to do that I'd try in school.&amp;nbsp; No, Sorcerers on the other hand basically hold their hand out and BANG! there goes a fireball of DEATH!&amp;nbsp; No studies required, just sheer power.&amp;nbsp; That's my ideal class, strength is not an issue (praise be to the light), and you dont need to read that much, if at all.&amp;nbsp;    I can only imagine that most of you are scratching your balls/head/whatever, and wondering, 'wow, how does this tie in to real life?'.&amp;nbsp; Well, i'm here to tell you how it does.&amp;nbsp; I can't really pinpoint something,&amp;nbsp; I'm terrible with names/dates/etc, I'm not detail oriented.&amp;nbsp; But I can tell you if something is wrong, good or what not.&amp;nbsp; That's why i'd make a terrible teacher, because I can't really go into detail about much of anything complicated.&amp;nbsp; Other than my INSANELY LIBERAL CATHOLIC VIEWS!&amp;nbsp; Gaw, I'm really just waiting for the Vatican Guard to show up at my house and slay me.&amp;nbsp; I have Xylothin, i shall fight.&amp;nbsp; However, this probably makes no sense, but let me give you an example of what i mean.    Ben and I are critiquing some oratory which was just given on why we should eat dog food.&amp;nbsp;    Ben:, "Well at half way through the speech, he stumbled along his/her words and replaced the word 'dog-food', with 'abortion is good'.&amp;nbsp; Also, the person did not look at the audience and urinated in his/her pants at the start of his/her speech."    The Wielder of Xylothin, "I thought it sucked balls, totally" *follows up with the Jayci arm wave*    In a related story (hopefully by now ya'll have picked up on the fact that 'in a related story' = 'to randomly change the subject').&amp;nbsp; You know how i hate being all preachy and shit.&amp;nbsp; I say "May God bless you and stuff",&amp;nbsp;but I dont&amp;nbsp;like being evangelical by any means.&amp;nbsp; But today, I felt very inspiried by God to do good will during work today.&amp;nbsp; So no matter how stupid the person was, no matter how severely they changed their order, I put a genuine smile on my face, and gave them their order and bid them a good day.&amp;nbsp; (phew, that was a mouthful).&amp;nbsp; Now I wasn't giving them bibles or anything, just spreading cheer.&amp;nbsp; OOOH!&amp;nbsp; and apparently some girl called in and asked my age, school and if i had a girlfriend, it was FUCKING HOSS!&amp;nbsp; I think because I actually listened to God today and spread my... here it comes... love, I had a good day today.&amp;nbsp;      May you all walk in the light of God...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Beautiful things... - 1/11/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So i was extracting a booger not but a few seconds ago, when i thought to myself, "damn, Jake is beautiful... and so is Navras."&amp;nbsp; So I'm going to compile for you a list of beautiful things.&amp;nbsp; Expect no order to this whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; Which reminds me, if you dont agree with EVERYTHING on this list... you have cancer, just thought I'd let ya know.&amp;nbsp; Probably testicular.&amp;nbsp; Sorry.      THINGS THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL!!!    Jake, Navras, money, gaming, gaming while naked, gaming while having sex with a hot naked woman,&amp;nbsp;naked women, unattractive people being shipped to an island of fire, homer simpson's soap on a rope, JOOOOOBS, more gaming, the act of playing video/computer games, Super Moleario, Jesus, the internet, MY FINAL GRADES, the fact that I still have the internet, Starcraft, Sephiroth, Sephiroth clones, Utada Hikaru (writer of "simple and clean"), Final Fantasy VII (may we all bow our heads).&amp;nbsp; The End.    Oh, I'm no princess... yet...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Támaso m&amp;#257; jyótir gamaya... - 1/13/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   "From darkness, lead me to light..."     The only person you need respect from is yourself.&amp;nbsp; Everyone else can die.&amp;nbsp; I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, within the last hour I've written 2 entries, and deleted both.&amp;nbsp; My mind is scattered.&amp;nbsp; One thing that's standing out right now is my adamant hatred for drinking, and the whores who do it.&amp;nbsp; I know jake hates it, and ben hates it.&amp;nbsp; For a brief period, I thought I hated it because they did, I thought they rubbed off on me.&amp;nbsp; But I know now that is not true.&amp;nbsp;    My sophmore year, my 'attraction', was based on two things, since then I've upped the standards.&amp;nbsp; You have to be smart and attractive.&amp;nbsp; Because of that, I immediatly became infatuated with the phantom.&amp;nbsp; I pretty much said, "she's the one for me".&amp;nbsp; I got my hopes up really high.&amp;nbsp; But she turned out to drink, alot.&amp;nbsp; She did drugs and had sex, alot.&amp;nbsp; After my ideal woman came crashing down, I would see her in the halls and be disgusted.&amp;nbsp; How could  you  do this?&amp;nbsp; To yourself and to me.&amp;nbsp; This bright girl is destroying herself.&amp;nbsp; She's shattering her future.&amp;nbsp; Liberals say TV and GTA3 will be the death of America, I attest it will be children like her, raised by parents like hers.&amp;nbsp; "Well, my dad's a drunk so that justifies my drinking and sexual promescuity".&amp;nbsp; Bullshit, if that were true then Jake and I would be at every party with a keg between each arm.&amp;nbsp; We truly are of a dying breed.&amp;nbsp;    So Jayci and Nate were discussing my lack of maturity.&amp;nbsp; I applaude them.&amp;nbsp; If being mature in this age is dictated by how stuck up you can be, how many beers you can drink before passing out, by silence, then I pray for eternal childhood.&amp;nbsp; I really get&amp;nbsp;my kicks out of going to debate and english, where you have taylor, andrew and jaqui, all on their high horses of arrogance.&amp;nbsp; I sit and wait for the day I can muster the courage to say, " I may be a gamer, but I would prefer any lifestyle, to one such as yours.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One where your only outlits for happiness include stuckupsmanship and drinking.&amp;nbsp; A life wrought with darkness "&amp;nbsp;    Perhaps that is not what they were refering to.&amp;nbsp; But I admit, I enjoy stupid and dirty jokes as much as the next junior high kid, maybe I just dont want to rush off, maybe I like being a little snot nosed asshole.&amp;nbsp; Fuck maybe, I damn sure do.&amp;nbsp; Nate tells me he's just joking though.&amp;nbsp; Common practice for him is to say he's joking, when he just put his foot in his mouth.&amp;nbsp; The 'wrong opinions' is a prime example.&amp;nbsp; But really, nathan is the only person I think who respects me.&amp;nbsp; And unless he's in&amp;nbsp;one of his pissy school moods, he's great to be around.&amp;nbsp;    Shit, try hanging around shannon when she's studying, HO-LI-SHIT!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Shannon's like that though, and I hate it.&amp;nbsp;      "Regardless of warnings, the future doensn't scare me at all...", Utada Hikaru   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Trying too hard... - 1/13/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I enjoy writing, I suppose it's my one outlit that I can rely on.&amp;nbsp; I write when I'm supposed to be doing my german/precal homework.&amp;nbsp; I write when I should be asleep.&amp;nbsp; Too bad I'm just not a reader.&amp;nbsp; My vocabulary sucks.&amp;nbsp; I drop ever swear word imaginable.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to be a writer.&amp;nbsp; Maybe not.&amp;nbsp; Wendell has really turned me off of writing.&amp;nbsp; Fuck works cited.&amp;nbsp; Fuck poetry.&amp;nbsp; Fuck english.&amp;nbsp; The reason the dictionary is so big is because the english language, or any language is an art.&amp;nbsp; I could get by using about 100 different words a day, just a bunch of, "oh yeahs", and "come here&amp;nbsp;a minute".&amp;nbsp; I really hate poetry.&amp;nbsp; Or at least the need to analyze it.&amp;nbsp; Wow, someone dragged a dead deer off the road, whoopty fuckin' doo.&amp;nbsp; I dont see any sense in reading an abstract poem, an ambiguous poem, and saying there are some things that are absolute.&amp;nbsp; It's either fucking abstract or not.&amp;nbsp; That's why I hate my english class.&amp;nbsp; There are wrong opinions in there.&amp;nbsp;    I talked to Greg about this, we've talked alot in the last two days.&amp;nbsp; He's basically told me that all english classes are like that.&amp;nbsp; Damnit.&amp;nbsp; Really, if I want to discuss the effects nature has on humanity and vise versa, I'd talk about it to my brother or father for hours.&amp;nbsp; But I dont really see the beauty of poetry when you have to disect it until it's nothing but the remains of Akira.&amp;nbsp; Hey, that was a good analogy.&amp;nbsp; Akira.&amp;nbsp;      "My body's not doing what I tell it to..."   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  As the sword peirces flesh... - 1/13/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I shed not one tear when I found out Amie broke up with me.&amp;nbsp; Nor when the Phantom turned to eternal darkness.&amp;nbsp; When Tiffane' decided to be friends, I looked her in the eye and said, "So".&amp;nbsp; When my most recent attraction denied me, I laughed.&amp;nbsp; The pain of lost love is not losing the love.&amp;nbsp; The pain of lost love is seeing seeing them with someone else.&amp;nbsp; In someone else's arms, holding some john doe's hand.&amp;nbsp;    You could have had me.&amp;nbsp; You could have had someone who would stand unflinchingly at whatever heaven sends to protect you.&amp;nbsp; You could have had my free time.&amp;nbsp; You could have had endless devotion, endless love.&amp;nbsp; But you chose to forfeit that all.&amp;nbsp; You throw that away.&amp;nbsp; For what?&amp;nbsp; For who do you sell me?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When did I become something to be tossed aside?&amp;nbsp; Lies, you sold me for lies.&amp;nbsp; You sold me for the lie that john doe will be me and better.&amp;nbsp; That he won't be jealous.&amp;nbsp; Fuck the lies.&amp;nbsp; I'm jealous because I can't stand throwing my heart on the goddamn table for you and seeing you pick at it.&amp;nbsp; "It's not enough", "I want more".&amp;nbsp; That's what you proclaim.&amp;nbsp; Well if you want more than that, you have no business even talking to me.&amp;nbsp; There is nothing more I can give.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, maybe next time around I'll be more forgiving.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I won't mind when you run past me to hug someone else.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I just thought that I mattered to you.&amp;nbsp; How fucking stupid could I be?&amp;nbsp; That's why I didn't chase after you.&amp;nbsp; Because if you so easily forfeit my heart, then why should I even bother to raise a finger to stop you.&amp;nbsp; When you were with me, I laid myself at your feet.&amp;nbsp; When you left, I turned my back.&amp;nbsp; But... when you returned, in the arms of john doe, I fell.&amp;nbsp; Broken, crushed.&amp;nbsp; I wish you wouldn't leave, but please... please just don't come back.&amp;nbsp; It hurts to see you out of my arms, but it kills you to see you in someone elses.&amp;nbsp;      Pam came back...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  January Challenge Retreat... - 1/19/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Holy talito challenge retreat was awesome.&amp;nbsp; About a year ago I went on this very retreat, and got next to nothing out of it.&amp;nbsp; This year, I staffed challenge.&amp;nbsp; This entailed me being the head time keeper, introducer and rule follower, woo hoo was that an change from my typical routine.&amp;nbsp; Apart from that I had my own small group, it consisted of 4 retreatents, 1 youth leader, and 1 adult leader.&amp;nbsp;    The retreat was awesome, i gained so much from it.&amp;nbsp; I felt moved by God for once in my life.&amp;nbsp; I prayed for strength, and God answerd my prayers.&amp;nbsp; Time spent in small groups made me appreciate my parents 50 fold, they actually respect me and the decisions I make.&amp;nbsp; There was a gay guy in my group.&amp;nbsp; During the 3rd or so meeting we had, he openly expresed this by asking whether or not it is moral to go to the 'Gay straight alliance club".&amp;nbsp; Me being the insanely liberal Catholic that I am interjected the following:    "Seeing as how Jesus surrounded himself around the filthiest of people, the worst sinners, I do not believe God concerns himself on the morality of homosexuality, but whether or not you are doing good for these people.&amp;nbsp; Gentail or Jew, Jesus loved all."    Saying this just baffeled my homophobic youth partner.&amp;nbsp; It was at this point I realized my absolut need to be at Prince of Peace youth group.&amp;nbsp; I may not raise a thousand dollars, or save anyone from the burning fires of hell.&amp;nbsp; My purpose is for balance.&amp;nbsp; There are times when I consider the fact that I act gay and that I stick up for gay rights taht people may consider me to be gay.&amp;nbsp; Let them.&amp;nbsp; I know for a fact, as well as my close friends that I am as straight as they come.&amp;nbsp; But I will not back down on two things: gays should be given full rights in the US, and being a liberal Catholic is my greatest asset.&amp;nbsp; Was Jesus himself not a radical in his own era?&amp;nbsp;    During a brief period of free time, I went and bought a rosary, my old one had been broken.&amp;nbsp; I sat in the chapel and prayed a good long rosary, (basically fifty 3 hail mary's and 7 our fathers... numbers may be off).&amp;nbsp; Every time I pray the rosary, I have one thing on my mind that I'm praying for specifically.&amp;nbsp; This time I prayed for God to lead me to my love... my true love.&amp;nbsp; When I was done, I looked up at the Icon of the crucifix and realized something.&amp;nbsp; No matter how hard I pray, no matter how many hours I volunteer, God won't just instantly deliver a beautiful companion to me.&amp;nbsp; That kinda pisses me off.&amp;nbsp; I want to find my love now.&amp;nbsp; I want to spend as much time with them as is possible.&amp;nbsp; As long sa my flesh allows.&amp;nbsp; Maybe not until I'm 21, or 31, or maybe I'll find the person I'm destined to be with forever on my death bed.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps this person is right under my nose, and I just dont know it.&amp;nbsp; That would be the worst of all.&amp;nbsp; May God bless all of you.&amp;nbsp;      God, grant me strength to persevere...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  For My Father the King... - 1/21/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  As spoken by Arthas Teranes of Loredoran...    Again on Challenge.&amp;nbsp; It was a humbling experience to be with my small group.&amp;nbsp; Every one of them had some complaint about their parents.&amp;nbsp; Either they were too stern, or they treated them like shit.&amp;nbsp; Maybe their grades weren't high enough, or they didn't act 'man enough'.&amp;nbsp; I sat back and listened to all of this and thanked God for my parents.&amp;nbsp; I usually bitch about them, in fact, I do that constantly.&amp;nbsp; But I realize now just how lucky I am.&amp;nbsp; My parents respect me.&amp;nbsp; They may not agree with me being a gaming obsessed man whore, but they respect my decisions, and allow me to be my own man.&amp;nbsp; By no means do I live up to my dad's ideal 'man', if that were true i'd be a drunken pussy chaser (for lack of a better funny term).&amp;nbsp; They still love me.&amp;nbsp; And I'm damn glad to have them as parents.&amp;nbsp; Crap, I can swear around my mom and she doesn't mind for hte most part.&amp;nbsp;    In regards to my parents, I'm really surprised I'm not a drunken man whore.&amp;nbsp; My dad always tells me that I am free to drink some of his beer or wine.&amp;nbsp; I may ahve a glass of wine with steak, but it's simply amazing what easy access I have to this stuff.&amp;nbsp; I could walk downstairs right now, crack open a bottle of Boddington and chug it in front of my dad, he'd only be upset if I spilled any.&amp;nbsp; He bought me condoms, and I dont have sex.&amp;nbsp; I suppose the only reason I can possibly fathom as of to why I dont embrace these two temptations is because of my friends.&amp;nbsp; Thank ya'll sonsofbitches.&amp;nbsp;    I love my brother too, he's a pessimist to my optomist, but he's damn fun to be around and talk to.&amp;nbsp; Plus he got me 2 hoss movies.&amp;nbsp; I'm gonna be his best man.&amp;nbsp; That's cool.    And jake too.&amp;nbsp; Just because he's beautiful.      God bless you my friends...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just maybe... - 1/21/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    "Maybe Cris is right.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I dont know what love is.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm just a stupid little teenager chasing every skirt I see.&amp;nbsp; But maybe not.",&amp;nbsp;Roac Wind&amp;nbsp;    When I look in your eyes, I see everything I want.&amp;nbsp; You&amp;nbsp;are the bringer of joy, and the dealer of death.&amp;nbsp; When I look in your eyes, I see beauty.&amp;nbsp; You aren't hot, by no means are you a venus, but that is why the attraction is much more fervent.&amp;nbsp; Perfection is not a real thing, but you're pretty damn close.&amp;nbsp; Maybe your smile is crooked, or maybe you hair isn't straight.&amp;nbsp; Maybe not.&amp;nbsp;    When I look in your eyes, I see laughter.&amp;nbsp; You make me smile.&amp;nbsp; When I screw up and fall on my own sword, you smile, and that's all that matters.&amp;nbsp; Maybe you're not always smiling.&amp;nbsp; Maybe you're not always laughing.&amp;nbsp; Maybe.&amp;nbsp; But maybe I can make you smile, maybe I can make you smile.&amp;nbsp; Just maybe.&amp;nbsp;    When I look in your eyes, I see saddness.&amp;nbsp; You are searching.&amp;nbsp; Just as I am.&amp;nbsp; Searching for a companion.&amp;nbsp; You have lost faith, but I have come to restore it.&amp;nbsp; Maybe you already have a companion.&amp;nbsp; Maybe he's right for you.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm not even close.&amp;nbsp; Maybe not.&amp;nbsp;    When I look in your eyes, I see a void.&amp;nbsp; I know now that  he  isn't enough for you.&amp;nbsp; He can't afford you.&amp;nbsp; He isn't even visible in that void.&amp;nbsp; He just emphasizes what's missing.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm here to fill your void.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm here to complete you.&amp;nbsp; Just maybe.&amp;nbsp; Just... maybe.      Maybe not...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just maybe clarification... - 1/21/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That last entry was a tad confusing if ya ask me.&amp;nbsp; It was written to my current topic of discussion, however, I believe the entry relates not to one person per se, it pertains to my concept of who my love shall be, and my mission.&amp;nbsp; Meh, something like that.&amp;nbsp; I doubt the person even knows who its too...&amp;nbsp; Just maybe...       Nalack'Ta Del Veck'Dodan Zey-Tel...    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Eternal Veil... - 1/21/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I once blamed the Phantom for casting this veil over my eyes.&amp;nbsp; Blinding me from seeing who she truly is.&amp;nbsp; But I know now it was not her who cast this veil.&amp;nbsp; It was me.&amp;nbsp; The reason I "fall in love" too easily, or so says Cris, is because of this veil I unwittingly cast over myself.&amp;nbsp; I suppose what I see with this veil is this perfect woman.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps not physically, but I just want to envision this attraction as right for me.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it's a Matrix.&amp;nbsp; Somethign I pull over my eyes to blind me from teh truth that there is no "right girl".&amp;nbsp; Perhaps this eternal veil represents my ignorance.&amp;nbsp; Or maybe it shows how I am so yearning for this love.&amp;nbsp; I am yearning to chase after someone.&amp;nbsp;    I want to be in love.&amp;nbsp; I want the chase to be over.&amp;nbsp; So I cast this veil over my head.&amp;nbsp; Blinding myself from truth.&amp;nbsp; So the reality that kicks in hits me hard, makes me want out.&amp;nbsp; But I can't get out.&amp;nbsp; The Veil, as by name is eternal... maybe.&amp;nbsp; I suppose when I do chase after someone, then it will be lifted.&amp;nbsp; Maybe not.&amp;nbsp;    I pray for strength.&amp;nbsp; Strength handed down by God to persevere.&amp;nbsp; So that I might find my love at the road's end.&amp;nbsp; That the journey might be over, and my life might begin.&amp;nbsp; This is what I pray for.&amp;nbsp; Lord God, grant me strength...      When does it end...   &nbsp;  I've been thinking lately... - 1/25/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've been thinking about you alot lately.&amp;nbsp; Maybe i'm just too filled with hope to see the possibility of failure.&amp;nbsp; Or just because I'm so head over heels.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure if you make me happy, or make me sad.&amp;nbsp; When I think about your crooked smile, I laugh, but when I remember you're in someone else's arms, my eyes turn dark.&amp;nbsp; It's a complicated situation I'm sure.&amp;nbsp; And I apologize endlessly to you.&amp;nbsp; I wish...    I wish you were here,    I wish your hand was in mine,    I wish I could wipe away that tear,    I wish I could make you laugh,    I wish I never make you cry,    I wish you were in my arms,    I hope... you don't leave.&amp;nbsp; Right now, i'm pretty confused.&amp;nbsp; I want to give up the chase, I'm lost.&amp;nbsp; But maybe, if I give up the chase, I'll be lost without you.&amp;nbsp; I've been thinking about you alot lately.&amp;nbsp; I think that makes me happy.&amp;nbsp; Just to know you're in my mind.&amp;nbsp; I've been thinking, what if the journey is over?&amp;nbsp; Or what if I'll never know...      I just wish...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just say no kids... - 1/27/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The DARE program is a waste of taxpayers money.&amp;nbsp; Having an overweight cop come into a 7th grade classroom and explain the terrible thigns that are associated with drugs and alchohol wont do shit.&amp;nbsp; I proprose a new program which I am damn sure will work, or die trying, that being the kids will die in the process.&amp;nbsp;    Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my grand drug/drinking/crime detterent.&amp;nbsp; It is called VGADS!!!&amp;nbsp; IT is an acronym for  Video Gaming Agasint Drugs and Shit .&amp;nbsp; Jake and I determined that Gaming led us down the right path through our adolecence.&amp;nbsp; When you game, you dont have friends, so who's going to tempt you into bad stuff like that?&amp;nbsp; When you buy games, you cant go out and buy drugs, so toke up on Mario world my friends... by that I mean play it, dont roll up mario games.&amp;nbsp; When you play video games, women are less likely to sex your pastey ass up.&amp;nbsp; How great would that be, no more premarital sex AND no more abortion.&amp;nbsp; See, gaming is truly the greatest gift of all.&amp;nbsp;    And to the Dumbocrats who believe gaming constitutes a great evil in this world.&amp;nbsp; How about I bust a cap in yo' ass.&amp;nbsp; haha, i'm just joking.&amp;nbsp; But to say that gaming should be banned b/c it leads to violence, then how about we throw out television as a greater whole, books, and the majority of music?&amp;nbsp; They have equally violent tendecies in lyrics and visuals.&amp;nbsp; If you're susceptable enough to play GTA 3 and then go out shooting people, you're too fucking stuipd to be allowed in society, you should be killed immideatly.&amp;nbsp; It's not my fucking fault some dumbass parents allow their 3 year old kids to play GTA 3, stupidass parents should be the ones with the warning lables.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, if i had my way, 90% of those asshole parents who show their kids porn or south park at the tender age of 10 should be sent to jail and have *Warning, this adult has no right to bear offspring or not have their balls beaten in* tattoed over their face.&amp;nbsp; That way they'll get their balls kicked in into yesteryear.&amp;nbsp;    In conclusion, fuck everybody... I like writing unserious shit.      The power is YOURS...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  When you walk away... - 1/29/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   "You don't hear me say..."     I'm contemplating my current situation at hand.&amp;nbsp; I am still stuck waiting.&amp;nbsp; As I've said, she does have a boyfriend.&amp;nbsp; It doesn't matter that I have feelings for her and she has a boyfriend, that's happened before.&amp;nbsp; What kills me is that she has feelings for me too.&amp;nbsp; It's hard as hell on me.&amp;nbsp; And the more I think about it, the more i talk ot the boyfriend, I realize I shouldnt be waiting, I should be moving on.&amp;nbsp; Sitting down pouting won't make things move any faster.&amp;nbsp; And from what i understand, he seems to truly love her, and the feeling is mutual from her.&amp;nbsp; Why taint so beautiful a thing?&amp;nbsp;    Another thing that concerns me.&amp;nbsp; She is unhappy or so she says.&amp;nbsp; I try to make her smile, I try to make her laugh.&amp;nbsp; And by doing this, i take on her sadness, i assume her pain.&amp;nbsp; This is unbearable.&amp;nbsp;    "You don't have a girlfriend to look cool or to tell your friends, you have a girlfriend to be happy, so if you're not happy, you're missing the point", Dusk.&amp;nbsp;    This is what's happening.&amp;nbsp; I want to be happy with her.&amp;nbsp; But I can't be with her, or happy.&amp;nbsp; So unless something changes, maybe it needs to be me, or perhaps it's just out of my control, the ideal shall fall.&amp;nbsp; All of this to waste.&amp;nbsp; I suppose after praying a rosary about it, part of which she was present for, I realiized the truth.&amp;nbsp; The truth that I simply cannot persevere.&amp;nbsp; Having realized this, we seem to be drifting, even further than where we once were, or going towards.&amp;nbsp; It pains me to see her, not in my arms, but once more, for God to answer one prayer, he must reject another.&amp;nbsp; I will assume this pain to allow her leave.&amp;nbsp; For now...      "... please, oh baby, don't go."   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Phuck Physics... - 2/4/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ahh, after cracking my knuckles of bictching, i'm back in the mood for my regular style of writing.&amp;nbsp; Humorous bitching.&amp;nbsp; Well, before i begin I shall do one serious monolouge... i guess.    I was told I blew 'her' having feelings for me, waaaaaay out of proportion.&amp;nbsp; But i ask, how would you interpret someone having feelings for you while in another relationship?&amp;nbsp; She's probably right though.&amp;nbsp; After all, I did throw my fragile body into harms way.&amp;nbsp; I guess I was reaching for hope.&amp;nbsp; Worked well ya?    Okay, enough of that shit, into my hilarity!&amp;nbsp; After having put much thought into this, i've realized i'm a very hateful person.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I hate most everyone.&amp;nbsp; And everything.&amp;nbsp; If there's something I don't have, i probably havnt heard about it yet.&amp;nbsp; Let me run down the list of all the stupid sonsofbitches that dwell in my already demonic physics class.     Stupid Fat Anti-Religious-discussion Crazy Bitch :    I may be in the middle of a religious conversation with someone and bring up tsome of the key words, like Jesus, God, religion, Catholic.&amp;nbsp; Every time it is followed by this bitch waddling her jelatenous body mass over in a putrid manner which involves the gnashing of teeth.&amp;nbsp; In a shrill, banshee like voice, she shreaks, "WILL YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT", as though the mention of the Christ burns away at her blubber.&amp;nbsp; I then retort with something along the lines of: "what? this does not concern you, and back off".&amp;nbsp; In her infinite wisdom she responds with a well thought up, "this is why no one likes you".&amp;nbsp; At this point you can imagine me doing my WHAT THE FUCK hand motion thing.&amp;nbsp; yeah, you know the one.&amp;nbsp;     Stuipd Fat Boyfriend-obsessed crazy bitch:     I really need to describe this Crazybitch.&amp;nbsp; Picture alice mcdonald, emphasis on the blatant misuse of a midriff.&amp;nbsp; now add about 100 pounds, a big case of DSL and facial features which resembe a swine.&amp;nbsp; There you have her.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and if her grossly unattractive features were not enough, it is the fact that she talks about her 57 year old boyfriend (barely exagerated) and how they have a well developed sex life, and that they have planned their marriage and how many babies they will abort.&amp;nbsp; Half the time I just want to slap her hog face and say, "BETRAYER OF THE LIGHT!!! No man should be attracted to you because you ARE UGLY and you have no sense of direction.&amp;nbsp; You buy more clothes than you wear!!!&amp;nbsp; If you fucking covered up I could justify your gross expendetures on clothing!!!&amp;nbsp; But no, you dress like a skank and you are a bitch!!!".&amp;nbsp; The rest of the time I'm just so repulsed by her I want to throw myself into an unquencheble fire.&amp;nbsp; Woe is me.&amp;nbsp;     Group of druggie car-obsessed freaks:     I can't accuratly describe this tribe of morons without the use of a conversation (warning: exagerations may follow):    Druggie I: "So dude, iwas totally cruisin' down 249 in my sweet ass V8 with the jacked up rims and tha X10YL system... ya, you know da one.&amp;nbsp; And I was jammin to some shit when I looked over and saw Rims N' Shit just opened up, and I was like dude"    Dumbass: "totally"    Drugface: "were you smokin' a blunt?"    Druggie I: "Dude, totally"    Dumbass: "totally"    Drugface: "but dude, were you like, smokin' it?"    Dumbass: "totally"    Druggie I: "So dumbass, what system do you have, how much dollars did you drop on that sweet ass ride of yos?&amp;nbsp; do you gots a V8, or what homes?"    Dumbass: "totally"    Drugface: "dude, i'm serious, were you like smoking like a blunt yo?"    Dumbass: "heh, totally"    Shit, that took a lot outa me.&amp;nbsp; By the way, I'm a level 7 Sorcerer and Jake is a lv 7 bard, so watch yoselves!&amp;nbsp; Oh, and Jones is pissed at me because I'm not helping her w/ the CX shit for debate.&amp;nbsp; I am endlessly pissed about this whole thing.&amp;nbsp; For one thing, I was out doing my junior conference during the entire lesson (which bret and gus did), I have NO idea what teh case structure is like, my teacher doesnt even konw.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, she told me to look for statistics on teh ocean... WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN???&amp;nbsp; the people teaching me are not experts on CX.&amp;nbsp; The whole concept of doing CX is a waste of my fucking time.&amp;nbsp; Funny thing is, when D let us slack off in debate, i worked hard, now that she's raining down the hells in my class, i dont fucking care.&amp;nbsp;    Oh yes, how could i conclude without touching on "The Final Battle".&amp;nbsp; It was a starcraft match between Glenn and I, and as some may have interpreted from the title, it was "the final battle" between glenn and i.&amp;nbsp; It lasted 4 and a half hours.&amp;nbsp; It was the most epic conflict to take place.&amp;nbsp; At the conclusion (which was Glenn's concession of defeat), the battlefield was nothing more than a smoking wasteland.&amp;nbsp; Covered in layers of ash upon blood and rotting corpses.&amp;nbsp; The sky would not show for all the smoke that rose.&amp;nbsp; Though I claimed victory, it was a hollow one.&amp;nbsp; I still want his blood.&amp;nbsp; The bastard shall pay.&amp;nbsp;      Totally...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just another day... - 2/7/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  This will be a retelling of the events that took place the seventh of february, 2004.&amp;nbsp; This won't be a funny entry, nor a sad one, just one about what I did taht day.&amp;nbsp; As I said, just another day.&amp;nbsp;    So I woke up around nine thirty in hte morning to start my prayer talk.&amp;nbsp; It's basically a 20 minute speech I have to give on the upcoming challenge retreat regarding my prayer life and how it's developed.&amp;nbsp; Truthfully it wont be that hard, because unlike the rest of the youth group, i devoted most of last year to writing and giving speeches, so I know the basic format and presentation.&amp;nbsp; So I opened up Word Perfect and began typing.&amp;nbsp; It turned out well, i wrote most of the outline during my few break times at work last thursday, so all i really did was elaborate.&amp;nbsp;    I had recently taken off Carly's sn from my buddy list, just trying to put her out of mind, just trying to forget her.&amp;nbsp; What woudl I talk to her about anyway?&amp;nbsp; How she doesn't like me, and how she thinks i'm an asshole.&amp;nbsp; Same old same old.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, I asked her why she wanted to be friends with me and she said something to the effect of, "you aren't always an asshole"... how kind aye?&amp;nbsp; So as I'm typing my Prayer Talk, being relativly inspired by the Lord, I get an IM from her.&amp;nbsp; So she asks me:    "what was with your last entry (Phuck Physics)"    So I bluntly tell her it was with a reference to physics, my hate of CX, etc.&amp;nbsp; She then debates with me how holy of a person she is by saying how these same people are bipolar bitches, and yet I am an asshole for writing it online to an audience of people who dont even know who's in my physics class, much less care.&amp;nbsp; So basically, she explained to me how her opinion of me dropped about eight points, bid me what i belived to be a "goodbye" forever and then signed off (or blocked me).&amp;nbsp;    Well, but for a little depressed, i really didn't care.&amp;nbsp; So I continued writing my talk well into the afternoon.&amp;nbsp; The night before, Greg got home.&amp;nbsp; I planned on spending my evening with him.&amp;nbsp; But instead he wanted me to 'do my homework while he and my parents conversed'.&amp;nbsp; So i went upstairs and played video games.&amp;nbsp; So as he walked in while I"m writing my talk and asked me if I wanted to go get my haircut (despretly needed), I gave him and my mother the cold shoulder.&amp;nbsp; They later realized that i'd get about 20 minutes of free time with Greg outside of last night's window.&amp;nbsp;    I finished half my talk, printed it out and got in my car.&amp;nbsp; Bearing in mind, the night before, the only way I got home from work was an endless amount of "hail marys".&amp;nbsp; I had no gas, I was running on air.&amp;nbsp; So I barely pull into the randal's gas station and fill up.&amp;nbsp; I got a complimentary 'off brand vanilla coke', which is probably still in my car.&amp;nbsp; I drive on over to the Welch's to get my prayer 'workshopped'.. Basically it's an adult critiquing my talk.&amp;nbsp; It was all fine and good.&amp;nbsp; I needed more 'feeling words and emotion' in my talk.&amp;nbsp; Meh, i'll edit it later.&amp;nbsp;    I got in my car, went to subway for the first time in ages and got a 12'' turkey sub.&amp;nbsp; damn good.&amp;nbsp; Went home, played halo until 3:30 and then went to work. Typical day at work.&amp;nbsp; Dumbasses, dippers, whores...&amp;nbsp;Same ol' same ol'.&amp;nbsp;    Nearing the end of the night, a lady pulls up having ordered an unsweet tea, miller light and sliced beef sandwhich.&amp;nbsp; As she pulls up I jokingly say, "i really hate handing beers out at drive thru".&amp;nbsp; I mean, who wants a drunk driver?&amp;nbsp; She then explains how her parapalegic husband wanted to come inside, but he couldn't get past the ramp.&amp;nbsp; I tell her I'll try to help.&amp;nbsp; So I go get sylvia and ask her what to do.&amp;nbsp; Sylvia kind of looks at the husband and goes, "well we have a ramp".&amp;nbsp; The woman explains how she cant get past the door.&amp;nbsp; Sylvia looks at the door.&amp;nbsp; She didn't care.&amp;nbsp; She just doesn't care.&amp;nbsp; At this point the lady is almost in tears and tells sylvia her husband is too embarassed.&amp;nbsp; The lady drives off.&amp;nbsp;    I close the window.&amp;nbsp; Put my back to my register and my face just falls to darkness.&amp;nbsp; I wanted ot help them.&amp;nbsp; I asked myself, "what could i have done differently".&amp;nbsp; I just leaned on the counter, staring into nothingness for what seemed like hours.&amp;nbsp; I felt hollow, unworthy.&amp;nbsp; That really affected me that night.&amp;nbsp;    I had to stay late, stocking up desserts for jake, since he was coming in for me sunday and all.&amp;nbsp; Well, clocking out around 9:30 I walked outside, 3 of the spanish only mexicans were outside conversing, apparently waiting for a ride.&amp;nbsp; I bid them a good night and walked out to my car.&amp;nbsp; This bald guy with a shaved head approached and asked me for 'a jump'.&amp;nbsp; I must have said excuse me four times, what being auto ignorant and such.&amp;nbsp; He apparently wanted a jump.&amp;nbsp; Well, it was dark out and this guy was a little scary.&amp;nbsp; I feared he'd try to kill me or something.&amp;nbsp; So i told him i'd get one of the mexicans to help out.&amp;nbsp; They obviously didnt understand me, nor did they want to walk the whole ten feet to 'guard me' at my car.&amp;nbsp; I knew i couldnt just leave this guy in the cold, so I said a prayer for courage and walked out to&amp;nbsp;help him.&amp;nbsp; He basically just hooked up some cables to my car, jumped it and shook my hand.&amp;nbsp; He said he'd fix my car if he ever saw me stranded.&amp;nbsp; I wish I had asked for his name, or told him not to wait for my car, but just any car he saw on the road.&amp;nbsp; This guy was a mechanic after all.&amp;nbsp; After I saw his car come back to life, I drove off, content.&amp;nbsp; Ihad this warm feeling all throughout me.&amp;nbsp; I had done something good for someone, no reason, no motivation.&amp;nbsp; Hell, iwas scared out of my mind.&amp;nbsp; But I did it.&amp;nbsp; It was great.&amp;nbsp;    My evening concluded with Halo until midnight.&amp;nbsp; Very exciting I suppose.      Do unto others...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  February Challenge Retreat... - 2/26/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sorry for this being such a late entry.&amp;nbsp; I just havn't had any writing ability in me as of late.&amp;nbsp; Meh, lack of inspiration kills aye?&amp;nbsp; This last weekend, well, truly from 2/20/04 3:30 pm, until 2/22/04 3:30 pm, I devoted all of my energies to spreading happiness and laughter.&amp;nbsp;    Last challenge retreat, my mission was to command the entire staff, I was the time keeper and rule maker.&amp;nbsp; it was damn fun.&amp;nbsp; This time I was charged with the task of delivering a 20 minute&amp;nbsp;(MAX)&amp;nbsp;speech on the evolution of my prayer life.&amp;nbsp; According to my mother, it lasted aproximatly 40 minutes.&amp;nbsp; But I kept all of the audience attentive and laughing.&amp;nbsp; What surprised me about talking for 40 minutes wasn't that I could do it, but that Matt (youth director), let me do it.&amp;nbsp; He's usually real strict on talk times, and how long they can last, but he let me exceed my limit.&amp;nbsp; I am so blessed to have Matt and Dave as youth directors.&amp;nbsp; I can't fathom there being a group that out do them at their job.&amp;nbsp;    That was it though, the pinnacle of my retreat this time was my Talk.&amp;nbsp; Granted, it was a key part to the retreat, but it wasn't fulfulling just sitting back watching everything else happen around me.&amp;nbsp; Because I was'nt time keeper, I sunk away into my own seclusion, I began to contemplate things.&amp;nbsp; Nothing truly unusual, just my future love life, spiritual life and carrer life.&amp;nbsp; Also, this retreat was filled with a bunch of jocks and drunks, whom I can't help but look down on.&amp;nbsp; I understand the judge lest ye be judged, but I guess it's nto the sin I'm seeing, just the sickness they have.&amp;nbsp; During the retreat, I belived that they were responsible for corrupting the weekend, that their unwillingness to be there, their hatred for hte environment affected me.&amp;nbsp;    I was wrong.&amp;nbsp; I went in there tired physically and emotionally.&amp;nbsp; It was I who ruined the weekend for me.&amp;nbsp; It was I looking upon tiffane' and pam (who attended) w/ sadness.&amp;nbsp; It was I who compared this challenge to last, which put me in a negative mood.&amp;nbsp; I went in there hating, and so I fear I spread this same emotion, this hatred.&amp;nbsp;    Somehow, whenever&amp;nbsp;I pray that I am not paried with someone, I get paired with that person.&amp;nbsp; January Challenge, i was paired with a hating, arrogant and hateful person.&amp;nbsp; But I perceviered, I shone past her hatred.&amp;nbsp; This challenge I prayed I would not be in the small group with Ashlee (troll).&amp;nbsp; And to my initial dismay, I was.&amp;nbsp; She just hates me.&amp;nbsp; She says she doesn't, or at least she tries not to, but she does.&amp;nbsp; Once more I asked God for endurance, and I still walk this earth.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't half bad.&amp;nbsp; I realize now her hatred is the product of an unhappy family.&amp;nbsp; I pity her now.&amp;nbsp;    Parent Letters.&amp;nbsp; For some, this is the emotional peak of the weekend.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Simply put, parent letters are letters from the respective retreatent or staff which are affirming and loving.&amp;nbsp; "i love you, and I'm proud of you", are the main themes present throughout letters.&amp;nbsp; Well, on my challenge, I got one from my mother.&amp;nbsp; January, I got one from mom again, and dad wrote "you're a fine young man".&amp;nbsp; This challenge I got one from my mother,&amp;nbsp;and 2 sentences from my father.&amp;nbsp; But also, my mother handed me a rather thick envelope from my brother.&amp;nbsp; Greg wrote me 4 pages double spaced of a letter to me.&amp;nbsp; It was amazing.&amp;nbsp; I love my brother, yet I always fall under his vast academic shadow.&amp;nbsp; He told me he was proud of me.&amp;nbsp; I didn't cry, unlike everyone else, but I was moved.&amp;nbsp;    At February challenge's closing, it struck me that this is a moving retreat one way or another.&amp;nbsp; My challenge, the one I was a retreatent at, I didn't go through any leaps and bounds spiritually.&amp;nbsp; In fact, as outlined in my talk, 'my challenge only helped to stagnate my prayer life'.&amp;nbsp; Challenge made me want to staff challenge.&amp;nbsp; I knew I could do just as good a job as Brett Lester, though I feel I did not when I assumed his role in January.&amp;nbsp;    January Challenge was amazing.&amp;nbsp; The whole week before the retreat I prayed.&amp;nbsp; I asked God for strength, and he granted it to me.&amp;nbsp; Because I needed it more that time, I needed to be standing and singing the whole way through, and so I did.&amp;nbsp; January Challenge gave me spiritual strength, which I carrry with me today.&amp;nbsp;    February Challenge did not grant me any gift but this knowlege: that the way I see the world is only affected by one person.&amp;nbsp; Me.&amp;nbsp; Jake and I conversed after Feb Challenge and I told him, that darkness only consumes our lives if we let it.&amp;nbsp; If my parents die, the only thing I can do is the way I react.&amp;nbsp; The way I choose to continue on.&amp;nbsp; I could on one hand kill myself in depression, or continue on... to carry my cross.&amp;nbsp;      Darkness trembels before Xylothin...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  And in its wake, the shattered cosmos... - 2/26/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The begining of my Junior year, the Nerd Clique was thriving with unquencheble fervor and gaming juice.&amp;nbsp; We went forth and multiplied.&amp;nbsp; I saw that the Nerds were in good harmony, I saw that it was good, and I was pleased with what I had spent my entire high school carrer up until then forging.&amp;nbsp; The residents of my kingdom streched as far political as Ben, as far Gothic as Jake, as far work ethicafied as Nathan.&amp;nbsp; With me at the thriving center, basking in the glory of my work.&amp;nbsp;    This was my home, my friends and I broke bread together here.&amp;nbsp; Our diversity made us special, but our samness made us whole.&amp;nbsp; However, just outside of my solar system of Nerds, in the abyss, in the darkness, there was Cris.&amp;nbsp; Cris knew no one and no one knew Cris.&amp;nbsp; I was perfectly content with this.&amp;nbsp; She was the vagrant, my wandering friend whom I spoke to rarely, not by choice, but by her boyfriend's twisted design.&amp;nbsp;    At the time that I thought true peace had been achieved, when Ben and Bret shifted back into orbit, I crossed a great threshold without even realizing it.&amp;nbsp; I directed nathan's truck towards the dark outworld.&amp;nbsp; We visted cris.&amp;nbsp; Despite my original hypothesis, Cris flourished in her new found friends, friends directed&amp;nbsp;by my hand.&amp;nbsp; Not only did she befriend nathan, but also jake, and later Sheena and Emily.&amp;nbsp; I was overjoyed, my friend of the abyss had come forth into my orbit.&amp;nbsp; Later even, I tied Joobs into my grand Clique, with Cris as her link.&amp;nbsp;    Unforseeable consequences ensued.&amp;nbsp; My grand design, my light which I had worked so hard to purify, would soon be bloched out.&amp;nbsp; Out of his naturally inquisitive nature,&amp;nbsp; Jake, my friend of ages sought to better undestand the anomoly which is Cris.&amp;nbsp; He attempted to better understand her inner workings.&amp;nbsp; In doing so, he offended the person he attempted to strengthen the friendship of.&amp;nbsp; Cris went berserk, she began thrashing about in my solar system, spiraling energies flew forth weaking the bonds that held everything in place.&amp;nbsp;    Amost immediatly after the thrashing of worlds, the entity Cris was bombarded by a lifeforce known only as ABC.&amp;nbsp; This intruding force tore apart at Cris's earthen flesh.&amp;nbsp; Making her face things she dared not to face.&amp;nbsp; At this time, her orbit grew closest to that of Sheena and Emily.&amp;nbsp; Sheena of course was the quickest to step up into the defensive stance.&amp;nbsp; This stance quickly turned to one of offense.&amp;nbsp; In order to uncover the masked ABC,&amp;nbsp; she aimed at accusing everyone with a beating heart.&amp;nbsp; Starting with Jake, nathan, and then me.&amp;nbsp; It was not regarded as, "jake could be responsible", but an accusation.&amp;nbsp; We were told it was us who attacked cris.&amp;nbsp; Yet despite the proof shown to the contrary, the Triad, Cris, sheena and emily continued the assault upon my friends and I.&amp;nbsp; Their cosmic spiraling disrupted my perfect creation.&amp;nbsp; I realized that soon, all I had achieved would be gone.&amp;nbsp;    A spiraling wind came through and shook the Solar System into oblivion, with the Triad descending back into darkness, and my own companions left in a shattered wasteland, trying to repair what damage had been done.&amp;nbsp; I once thought ABC was responsible for the destruction at hand.&amp;nbsp; But I was wrong, ABC was simply the wind that carried forth the fires of hatred, distrust and lies that brewed deep in the Triad.&amp;nbsp; My Utopia is now but a fleeting memory.&amp;nbsp;    Looking at the ashes of my shattered worlds, I realize now that by severing the connections with the Triad, my connection with those who remain is greater.&amp;nbsp; we shall rise again, no wind shall rupture my fields of Nerd again.&amp;nbsp; Darkness holds no sway over my friends.&amp;nbsp; Xylothin lives on.&amp;nbsp;      Hold on to what you love most, the end is near...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nothing's like before... - 2/29/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Listening to: anime music    On my lap: Hunter the cancerous kitty    what i'm not doing for 35 more days: masturbating    what I wish I could be doing during this season of Lent: masturbating    my one way out of depression: masturbating    Something I'm good at: masturbating    favorite color: gray masturbation    Gaw, Lent is killing me right now.&amp;nbsp; Curse my Catholicism.&amp;nbsp; Well, I've been thinking latly how the remants of the Old (evil) youth group are fading away this year.&amp;nbsp; No longer will there be cookie nazis telling me to only take one cookie opposed to three (out of five hundred cookies).&amp;nbsp; No longer will I be one of fourthousand Bry(i)ans.&amp;nbsp; I will be the top dog per se.&amp;nbsp; I'm ready to just get rid of those assholes who are to caught up on glorifying themselves to actually lend a helping hand, but at the same time, I'm afraid.&amp;nbsp; I will be the one leading challenge next year.&amp;nbsp; I'll be center stage for PoP youth group.&amp;nbsp; Simply because I'm one of the few juniors now, and I dont cry or bitch about the dumbest things.... at church anyway.&amp;nbsp;    I have a lot of doubt in myself.&amp;nbsp; It may not seem like it, but I do.&amp;nbsp; I doubted myself going up to speak in front of everybody and be the time keeper for january challenge.&amp;nbsp; I'm not adequete enough.&amp;nbsp; I have little confidence in front of a big crowd, granted, I can give a speech until my hair turns gray, but I can't command a crowd very well, if at all.&amp;nbsp; Mostly because I've seen Bret lester or Matt Regitz do it so much better.&amp;nbsp; They are just awesome at talking in front of people.&amp;nbsp; I just cant dance or sing on stage, i start shaking and blubbering.&amp;nbsp; Truly, it's embarassing.&amp;nbsp; This all boils down to the fact that compared to my brother and father, i'm a small person.&amp;nbsp; six foot one, both, 250 pounds give or take a few for each.&amp;nbsp; They're just big guys.&amp;nbsp; I weigh about a hundred and fifty.&amp;nbsp; I'm about as intimidating as the rabbit in monty python... before it began its mass slaughter.&amp;nbsp;    I never get nervous.&amp;nbsp; honostly, I never choke on tests, speeches or what not.&amp;nbsp; The only time i've ever been afraid/nervous was my first debate with ben.&amp;nbsp; he walked into the practice room and I almost peed.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, right before I gave my talk, everyone was like "aren't you nervous".&amp;nbsp; i had to lie to them to make them feel better.&amp;nbsp; It was just another speech.&amp;nbsp; Longer and more feeling associated with it, but the presentation was the same.&amp;nbsp;    In the topic of Catholicism, I shall be recieving the sacrament of Confirmation this upcoming month.&amp;nbsp; Basically the 4th of six obatainable sacraments in the church.&amp;nbsp; Layman's terms, I'm 'confirming' i'll be practicing my faith in the years to come.&amp;nbsp; The next sacrament shall be Matrimony, oh so I can only hope.&amp;nbsp; I shall be addressing this topic in the next entry.&amp;nbsp;    This really is an entry to myself.&amp;nbsp; There was no order to it and i'm sure i've offended at least one person tonight.&amp;nbsp; farewell, and may you all walk in the light of God.      Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  Regarding work... - 3/17/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  this is what i hope to be the first of several updates... i haven't written in a hojillion years, so we can regard that as the calm before the storm... OF FABULOUS ENTRIES FILLED WITH LAUGHTER AND EXCITEMENT!!!&amp;nbsp; *plays dramatic and suspensful music*    So its tuesday.&amp;nbsp; March the ninth, 2004 years Post Christ's Death.&amp;nbsp; The passion of the Christ has been out for just as long as I haven't been masturbating (its what i gave up for lent.&amp;nbsp; Crazy Catholics).&amp;nbsp; I'm at work, and it is surprisingly a slow day at all three stations, Line, Drive thru (me!) and call ins (not a surprise).&amp;nbsp; Ben, Danny and I were conversing about alcoholism and the ethics related to it.&amp;nbsp; I noted that it's Ironic to drink shortly after watching "the passion".&amp;nbsp; I suppose it's like getting the greasiest burger on the menu, a large order of fries, and&amp;nbsp;a diet Coke.&amp;nbsp; That diet coke sure will keep you from gaining 2 pounds.&amp;nbsp;    nearing the end of the conversation, i point out that it is difficult to say that drunks are more sinful than myself, but it is that i acknowledge my sinfullness.&amp;nbsp; I stated my disdain does not lie specifically on drinking, but the fact that many people justify their drinking.&amp;nbsp; Sarah, (boss's granddaughter) overheard part of what we were saying, and then had Raul and Heather feed her false information on what she didnt hear.&amp;nbsp; The primary message that got across to Sarah (also fills out the schedules) was: "Bryan said that all drunks go to hell".&amp;nbsp; So Sarah comes out and tells Danny and I that we're ignorant and don't know what we're talking about, and to get back to work.&amp;nbsp;    Danny then tries to apologize for offending her.&amp;nbsp; She turns around to him and says, "My mother was a drunk, and she was always there for me".&amp;nbsp; Danny responds by saying, "that doesnt make drinking right".&amp;nbsp; Probably not the best thing you could say to a hyper emotional chick who fills out your paycheck.&amp;nbsp; But hey, that was his right.&amp;nbsp; While sarah is crying in her office, Ben, Danny and I contemplate how badly our firing will be.    After balling her eyes out, Sarah returns from her demonic chamber, approaches Danny and I and says, "Listen, my personal life does not affect my workplace".&amp;nbsp; Before my friend or I could say anything, she turned around began to walk back.&amp;nbsp; Before she got near her office, she turned back around and in a fiery rage shouted, "oh, and yo'ure a 'catholic', aren't you Bryan?".&amp;nbsp; I nodded.&amp;nbsp; "Well your 'people' commit the worst sins of all.&amp;nbsp; You molest children."&amp;nbsp; I was used to making those jokes, but not taking them.&amp;nbsp; I quietly called her on her absolute ignorance.&amp;nbsp; "And danny, you smoke ciggarettes.&amp;nbsp; Well that's an addiction too."&amp;nbsp; Danny tried to explain how he hasnt smoked for a while.&amp;nbsp; Danny repented.&amp;nbsp; He's a good person, nicest guy you'll ever meet.&amp;nbsp; Before she returned to her darkness, she expclaimed, "i used to have so much respect for ya'll, but now I can't even call you my friends".&amp;nbsp; Which doesnt make any sense because Sarah really never liked me to begin with.&amp;nbsp; Oh well.&amp;nbsp;    It was then that the three of us started to consider handing in our 2 weeks notice.&amp;nbsp; Our Mass Exodus we called it.&amp;nbsp; So that saturday evening.&amp;nbsp; Ben and I walked into the office and told Sylvia we were leaving.&amp;nbsp; She almost exploded in terror.&amp;nbsp; these are two of her most experienced people leaving simultaneously.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, Sylvia and Ted tried to talk us out of it for about forty minutes, to no avail.&amp;nbsp; We made up our minds.&amp;nbsp; We were leaving.&amp;nbsp;    On a lighter note, I'm still getting idiots through Drive Thru:    -"i'd like 2 iced teas".&amp;nbsp; Sweet or unsweet?&amp;nbsp; "... uh, i mean lemonade, i wanted lemonade"    -I'd like a ten piece fried chicken dinner.&amp;nbsp; "ma'am, that doesnt even exist"    -and the ever so frequent: "i'd like a plain potatoe, with nothing on it... except for chopped beef, cheese, butter, bacon bits, chives and sour cream".&amp;nbsp; So you want a meat potatoe with everything on it?.&amp;nbsp; "NO.&amp;nbsp; what did i just say?"      I have returned...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Regarding Joobs vs. Lass... - 3/17/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Apparently I love Jayci more than lauren... I guess?      I totally wasn't told to do this...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Regarding the Church and my faith... - 3/17/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  It would be soooo cool if I was just transformed into one of the Seraphim.&amp;nbsp; The ninth and most powerful of the choirs of heavenly angels.&amp;nbsp; 3 sets of wings.&amp;nbsp; Uberheavenly.&amp;nbsp; Like Jake and I have always said, "we could get so many chicks if we had wings."&amp;nbsp; well, that just means I'd get three times as many girls right, right?&amp;nbsp;    Since my recent entries, I've narrowed my religious views to two main ideas.&amp;nbsp; These two theories that I have concoted through meditation and spiritual exploration serve as the crux for my spiritual life.&amp;nbsp; Not like I've adopted two new radical ideals, but more that I've narrowed my radical and liberal Christian views to focus on two things.&amp;nbsp;    I:&amp;nbsp;  God does not hear our words, but understands our feelings. &amp;nbsp;    This came to me as I was praying.&amp;nbsp; I'm not too good when it comes to sayign the our father.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, I'm sure many people can say the ourfather in four languages, and backwords.&amp;nbsp; But do they mean it?&amp;nbsp; Plus, a divine being would not reduce Himself/Herself to the archaic way which humans communicate, that being vocally.&amp;nbsp; It is in my belief that God listens to what is in our hearts, not what is on our lips.&amp;nbsp; Not to say that all people who pray correctly are bad, some intentions are true and some are false.&amp;nbsp; This falls in line with my belief that God does not condemn those who worship him by name.&amp;nbsp; To live a Christian life, you don't need to worship him by name, but worship Jesus by walking in his path, by doing good deeds.&amp;nbsp; So if you say in your mind, "Buddah, you keep me safe", but are fundamentally a good person, I weigh your spirituallity far above anyone who declares Jesus as king, but fails to follow in their 'king's' footsteps.&amp;nbsp; This is why I have trouble accepting saturday parties, and sunday Christians as truly good people.&amp;nbsp; Christianity it seems, has been reduced to no more than a brand name.&amp;nbsp; People are Christian to be cool.&amp;nbsp; Rarely is the&amp;nbsp;quality&amp;nbsp;of their faith up to par.&amp;nbsp;    II:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The scientific explanation of Holy events does not reduce the spiritual mystery behind it.     Evolution.&amp;nbsp; The Big Bang Theory.&amp;nbsp; These two things are regarded as heresy by some.&amp;nbsp; But I say to you, does the fact that the sky is blue because of light refracting off the ozone layer, or that the grass is green due to photosynthesis reduce the fact that it is all willed by God?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; Nowhere in the old testament, or new will you find a verse, chapter or book regarding the concepts of algebra or calculus, but are they blaspheme?&amp;nbsp; Nowhere in any version of the bible will you find God explaining that stars are created by a fusion reaction.&amp;nbsp; But does that mean fusion reactions did not, nor will not occur?&amp;nbsp; This belief allows me to look at the bible from a less than literal standpoint.&amp;nbsp; The bible was written for an ancient people from an ancient perspective.&amp;nbsp; The message, though from a different viewpoint is still the same though.&amp;nbsp; Do not kill, Love your neighbor, Love God.&amp;nbsp; Those things do not change.&amp;nbsp;      I Corinthians Chapter 13...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Regarding love... - 3/17/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have NO good inspiration to look to when it comes to finding someone.&amp;nbsp; My dad tells me that I should find someone attractive.&amp;nbsp; That my quest for a female who I can cross swords with in discussion is futile.&amp;nbsp; That I should find someone attractive, and then train them to think.&amp;nbsp; This disgusts me.&amp;nbsp; I love my dad, but his mind is so inconcieveably warped on the concept of love.&amp;nbsp; It is the antithesis of mine i must say.&amp;nbsp; (well, I would like a hot chick,lol).&amp;nbsp;    I prayed a rosary to find my love.&amp;nbsp; I know that i will, but I'm so damn impatient.&amp;nbsp; I want to know who I'm going to spend the rest of my life with now.&amp;nbsp; I want the rest of my life to START now.&amp;nbsp; I want my love to be able to kick my ass every now and then in StarCraft.&amp;nbsp; I want to talk about how great Sephiroth is with my companion.&amp;nbsp; But, i'll probably die single or miss the one chance I get.&amp;nbsp; Damn.&amp;nbsp; I'm just a flawed person.&amp;nbsp; I expect so much.&amp;nbsp;    It's gotten better though.&amp;nbsp; Ican control my inital urge to think the cute girl that walks by me in the hall just happens to be my future wife.&amp;nbsp;    I've been here waiting for you...    Right here&amp;nbsp;on this old bench...    But i've been here so long waiting...    So long that I can't leave from here...    Let's sit down together...    And watch the sun set...    Together...      Until the end of my days...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Working outside is fun in theory... - 3/19/2004  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I bought Harvest Moon: A wonderful Life, the day it came out.&amp;nbsp; That being the seventeenth of March, 2004.&amp;nbsp; Nineteen days before the greatest of all movies comes out on DVD.&amp;nbsp;    Anyways, it's kind of ironic.&amp;nbsp; The game is where you as the player, go outside all day and work.&amp;nbsp; Which in real life I would hate until kingdom come, but this game genre is just so addicting.&amp;nbsp; Nothing is more fun than watching your chickens grow, or your crops come to eyes height.&amp;nbsp; Or trying to woo that special lady into marraige.&amp;nbsp; I'll go off on a tangent about that later.&amp;nbsp; I bought the game wednesday before work.&amp;nbsp; Worked, came home and played a video game about manual labor.&amp;nbsp; Went to bed at five playing teh damn game.&amp;nbsp; Woke up to a mother telling me to pull weeds.&amp;nbsp; It's fucking crazy.&amp;nbsp;    As for my review on the game.&amp;nbsp; It's nothing like the previous harvest moon games I've played.&amp;nbsp; In some aspects, its a lot easier, but also much harder than the previous HM models.&amp;nbsp; For example, there's no clearing out your field.&amp;nbsp; You basically inherit this farm your dad bought just before he died.&amp;nbsp; (Note: at one point in time, someone says, " your father died and was no longer able to take care of the farm "... Natsume is notorious for bad translation, its almost Zero Wing bad sometimes.)&amp;nbsp; You already have a field of grass prepared for you, and you get a horse and cow for free.&amp;nbsp; Picking up chicks is worlds easier compared to teh GBA version.&amp;nbsp; You basically show up to the front door of a girl's house with flowers and she throws herself at you.&amp;nbsp; (it helps being the only able body in the whole damn town :P).&amp;nbsp;    On the other hand, there are NO festivals, no days (monday tuesday, etc) and you cannot get married until the end of the first year.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, I proposed the end of spring, and wont hit it with my special lady until next spring.&amp;nbsp; wtf?&amp;nbsp; Also, when watering plants, there's no water can (to my knowledge) that waters an entire patch, plus, you need a laser guided bucket to hit the damn patch of seeds some times.&amp;nbsp; You pretty much aim your bucket with the joystick, and hope to God a faint breeze doesnt catch it and move it off target... its sensitive like nothign else.&amp;nbsp; Fun game though, I'll play harvest moon until the day I die.&amp;nbsp;    Off on my tangent.&amp;nbsp; Getting married in harvest moon is simple.&amp;nbsp; You wake up, pick flowers, give hot chick flowers, give girl (with visible beating heart) blue feather, and walk down aisle.&amp;nbsp; I wish it was that easy in real life.&amp;nbsp; But I'm afraid of going outside to pick flowers... there are bears outside.      As to the effect of juging weather...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I do this for Auir... - 4/9/2004  Its about damn time I started logging again.&amp;nbsp; hell.    I've been going to church a whole bunch.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be for confirmation classes (waste of time), bible study (not waste of time), or planning retreats and such, a heck awhole lot of my hours have gone in there.&amp;nbsp; And quite frankly, I'm not really good friends with anyone there.&amp;nbsp; At least, nowhere near as good as I am with my 'school clique'.&amp;nbsp;  So why do I go? &amp;nbsp;    What makes me continue on, even though my presence is not noticed by&amp;nbsp;my peers.&amp;nbsp; Maybe they don't understand me, or maybe they don't like the constant Matrix references I throw out.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps its the fact that I don't bring up my school achievements (mostly because it's a lackthereof).&amp;nbsp; I just don't fit in.&amp;nbsp; Just to put things in perspective, being in my youth group is like having your ex-girlfriend ask you who they should date.&amp;nbsp; I constantly hear the juniors planning all of these crazy adventures and movie nights.&amp;nbsp; Right in damn front of me.&amp;nbsp; I might catch their eye for a second or two, but I am almost totally unnoticed.&amp;nbsp;  Why do I go? &amp;nbsp;    I am a radical.&amp;nbsp; I believe in gay rights, I am a liberal Catholic.&amp;nbsp; The mere mention of my ideals sends many into seizure at my church.&amp;nbsp;  Why do I go? &amp;nbsp;    A lot of them are bastards.&amp;nbsp; If they aren't falling onto the streets, pale faced and complaining about the many burdens they assume, they are looking at their watches, in hopes that a bible study will pass by sooner.&amp;nbsp;  Why do I go?     Everyone there has missed the point.&amp;nbsp; They don't understand that they are there, not to hook up with chicks, nor to socialize.&amp;nbsp; They aren't supposed to be stopping by merely to spread the infection of their biggotry and hatred.&amp;nbsp; But they do these things.&amp;nbsp; Maybe that's why I don't fit in.&amp;nbsp;  Why do I go? &amp;nbsp;    I realize now why I go.&amp;nbsp; Why I persist on staffing these retreats, alongside what I consider to be a people out of place.&amp;nbsp; I do this, so that there is at least one voice among the crowds of hatefulness, trying desperatly to give forth the message that I feel needs to be delivered.&amp;nbsp; I'm not there to preach any particular gospel, nor to quote any of the Psalms.&amp;nbsp; Mostly because I know few, if any at all.&amp;nbsp; Love one another, do good always.&amp;nbsp;  But who listens?&amp;nbsp;     I go not for my own benefit, I don't mark down the 'community service hours'.&amp;nbsp; I believe that by 'checking in' your service hours, you defeat the purpose of serving.&amp;nbsp; I go there to do good, and for Matt.&amp;nbsp; Matt, I believe is the only reason I still attend POP youth group.&amp;nbsp; May God bless him and his family always.&amp;nbsp;      My life for Auir...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sup bitchez... - 4/9/2004  &nbsp;  Did ya'll like the totally improper use of the letter 'z' in the word bitches.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, onto my point of discussion today.&amp;nbsp;    Shout out to...&amp;nbsp;  EMILY!   The only girl who has, and probably ever will touch my dong... haha, that rhymes with Phong.&amp;nbsp; Fucking Phong, that sonofabitch should eat my dong.&amp;nbsp; haha, i said dong again.     Later Bitchez...      Coochy tag isn't for kids...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  To Kob 2... - 4/11/2004  The title is kind of a joke.&amp;nbsp; Jake reminded me of the entry I wrote when we were having another brawl.&amp;nbsp; We have those alot.&amp;nbsp; Not as much as nathan and I do, but still.&amp;nbsp; haha.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I thought the title was funny, so if you dont laugh at it, you have cancer.&amp;nbsp; I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.&amp;nbsp;    I'm playing FFIX right now.&amp;nbsp; It's pretty fun.&amp;nbsp; I like Zidane except for his tail, it reminds me of a penis, except its nothing like a penis.&amp;nbsp; But who's counting.    I wrote this entry for one reason.&amp;nbsp; The rest of that was garbage simply to fill your minds with.. well garbage.&amp;nbsp; So I hope yo'uve had your fill.&amp;nbsp; Now, onto the REAL reason I wrote this entry.    Jake, you are going to come to my house to give me the sex, Period.&amp;nbsp; Haha, i said period followed by the punctuational period.&amp;nbsp; Ironic?      Now it's time to play.&amp;nbsp; Yes, let's have some fun...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  You have got to let it all go... - 4/14/2004  Fear, doubt, disbelief.&amp;nbsp; Free your mind...    As those of you who know me... well, know.&amp;nbsp; I am a man of conformity, or at least under the belief that conformity is a healthy practice in some cases that provides humanity with acceptence and love with everyone (including cookies) need.&amp;nbsp; So as proposed by my church friend (yeah, the one jayci wants to kill, hopefully in jest), I will allow everyone to ask three, preferably serious, questions to tap into my psyche.&amp;nbsp; Thus allowing for the spread of information about my personal beliefs and stuff.&amp;nbsp; After asking these questions of me, open up a segment where questions are similarly asked of you.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion this will provide for a more open environement.&amp;nbsp; Hmm, my BSing ability is returning to me.&amp;nbsp; Time to power up...      Kaioken... raised to the fifth power...   &nbsp;  30 weeks down... - 4/14/2004  Looking back on my early assessment of my junior year in high school, found HERE&gt;&gt;&gt;  urlLink http://www.opendiary.com/entryview.asp?authorcode=A633966&amp;amp;entry=10087&amp;amp;mode=date &amp;nbsp;I feel it would be best to go back and recap on the way things are now.&amp;nbsp; Not so much pros and cons, more like, why i'm habitually pissed off.&amp;nbsp; And yes, as Jayci and I came to the conclusion today, I'm only 'not bitching', when i'm talking about the matrix.&amp;nbsp; Even then... its iffy.&amp;nbsp;    Debate 2 Period I:    The senior I once despised... is still a horrible person.&amp;nbsp; haha, gaylor.&amp;nbsp; the teacher I once enjoyed thoroughly... is now putting me through hell.&amp;nbsp; The bitch senior who explained how she's uberexperinced in debate... is now one of my best friends who i've adopted the woot woot of.&amp;nbsp; The only class I once had passion for... has died out because we got screwed out of an agreement the teacher made with us.      End result... taking debate 3 next year, God be with me.   Nazi... err, German 2 Period II:    I really can't stand that class.&amp;nbsp; It's gay.&amp;nbsp; And yes, that means my german class has sex with other foreign languages of hte same sex.&amp;nbsp; No, I looked at a worksheet yesterday and realized, I havn't learned more than 10 words that I can recite in german.&amp;nbsp; The two years were a complete waste for me.&amp;nbsp; meh, I should apply&amp;nbsp;myself more in school      End result... not taking a third year (of the same) foreign language.&amp;nbsp; (damn french)    Precal Period III:   Smart teacher, bad teacher.&amp;nbsp; Lemker is a genious.&amp;nbsp; But I simply cannot learn without Rand's help.&amp;nbsp; I NEED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.&amp;nbsp; Saying, "how do you get to this", completely skipping every step inbetween where i knew something, and started getting screwed up, DOESNT HELP AT ALL!!! in fact, it discourages me and makes me NOT want to do anything in class.&amp;nbsp; Actually turned in my homework today,&amp;nbsp;I smiled a bit.&amp;nbsp;     End result... bring it on calculus, I'm immune to failing now.    US History Period IV:   Good teacher, bad person.&amp;nbsp; I'm really tired of Fisher explaining how great she is, and by following in her path is similar to that of following a female version of Jesus.&amp;nbsp; Maybe i just hate hearing the same thing over and over again.&amp;nbsp; I learned alot though.&amp;nbsp; I can say that much, but it does irritate me when her wealth of knowledge does not extend much past the pages of tindall.&amp;nbsp; I must be looking for a deep thinker.    End result... Greg had a better experience with her I guess.&amp;nbsp; Least his grades did.    Physics Period V:   Smart teacher, bad teacher.&amp;nbsp; Once more, I believe that Klien sits on a vast cache of information.&amp;nbsp; His only handicapp is the inability to deliver this information to his students.&amp;nbsp; And being&amp;nbsp;a teacher, who's sole function on this earth is to relay such information, the handicapp is quite large.&amp;nbsp; Also, I dont really talk to anyone, so I sleep.&amp;nbsp; and that dumb idiot woman believes that by me sleeping, I am trying less than she is, despite the fact that if she actually attends more than 8 times a semester, she is talking about her decreped boyfriend.&amp;nbsp; Moral of the story is I WANT OUT!!!    End result... Phuck physics.    Health Period VI:   Yeah, coach rodgers is a funny guy.&amp;nbsp; Quite possibly a child molester (every girl sits on his desk... slightly upsetting).&amp;nbsp; Ironically enough, he reminds me of my father.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and every story he tells ends with a friend of his dying.&amp;nbsp; It's sad really.&amp;nbsp; But yeah, he's like a teaching version of my father.    End result... No complaints, I get to sleep when needed.    English Period VII:   Smart teacher, crazy teacher.&amp;nbsp; Wendell is so damn funny.&amp;nbsp; I'm totally going to come into her classes next year and be an idiot or something.&amp;nbsp; Just for the sake of hating her.&amp;nbsp; Haha, truthfully though, I think she's awesome.&amp;nbsp; Her method for grading papers, that being the 'if when i burn it with my mystical fire, and it turns red, its an A' is a little wierd, and I still dont care for the whole, 'poetry is open for interpretation unless it conflicts with that of my own', but oh well.    End result... Angry beavers is actually a show for children.     Phew, 6 more weeks...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Affirmation... - 4/15/2004  This was something I learned in Challenge.&amp;nbsp; Affirmation is when we, at the end of the retreat, go around and write down something we liked or how we were affected by each person in the small group.&amp;nbsp; It's so when they go home, they have something that makes them smile.&amp;nbsp; And recently, I feel I havn't met up to par with being a good friend.&amp;nbsp; So here goes, I will be listing off my friends in the order of which I came to befriend them as best I can remember.&amp;nbsp; Joking aside, no sarcasm, no hidden daggers.&amp;nbsp; And as you can see, noting me on this entry will be impossible.&amp;nbsp;    Glenn, You were my first friend in Texas.&amp;nbsp; I recall the first thing my brother and I asked you, many moons ago, when I could see your house from mine, "do you like nintendo".&amp;nbsp; You've always been a genuinely kind and frinedly person.    Johnny, Probably the first person who could have me burst into hysterics.&amp;nbsp; I've always appreciated your sense of humor, though I never could fathom where you get it.&amp;nbsp; It's amazing though, we've been friends for about 7 years now, and our topics of conversation aren't incredibally different.&amp;nbsp; I recall in Mrs. Wilson's class, when Glenn introduced us to each other.&amp;nbsp;    Bret, your Catholicism has helped me keep mine.&amp;nbsp; I strive to be as well read in my faith as you are.&amp;nbsp; It was you saying, "I can see you taking part in the Catholic Church", which led me to contemplate becoming a youth minister.&amp;nbsp; I can recall shaking your hand at the peak of enchanted rock, "you're bryan honeycutt aren't you?" you said.&amp;nbsp;    Sarah S, My God, you are the reason I kept going to church.&amp;nbsp; Your warm smile was the only thing I needed.&amp;nbsp; I can't claim to have found anyone who is as openly friendly and charismatic as you are.&amp;nbsp; You made me feel a part of the church, and I truly miss you.&amp;nbsp; I remember sitting on the coach, not quite a freshman yet when you asked me, "hi, what's your name, what school do you go to, and what's your favorite shampoo?"    Brendon, Like Sarah, you were keeping me on my feet, and going to church.&amp;nbsp; I can attribute all of my sexual ambiguity to you, and thank God for that.&amp;nbsp; You were the first guy i hugged (i'm not gay), and just a pleasure to be around during the jr. High lockin.&amp;nbsp; I can recall me taking off your hat and saying to you, "now i'm going to be your&amp;nbsp; mini-you".    Nathan, you are a dedicated person.&amp;nbsp; I truly enjoyed the many debates we woudl have from topics ranging from why FFVII is greater than FFX, to why the bombing of hiroshima was justified.&amp;nbsp; Its always been fun driving you around and giving you gray hairs.&amp;nbsp; I can recall sitting w/you and paul at lunch and you asking, "you're catholic right, so you don't belive in the big bang theory".a    Ben, I have more respect for you than anyone else.&amp;nbsp; You are the best debater I have ever had the opportunity to witness, bar none.&amp;nbsp; I have looked to you as a moral guide in more than one occasion, whether you know it or not.&amp;nbsp; You are one of the only people who can make me burst into hysterics nowadays.&amp;nbsp; I can recall the good ol' days in English where I'd turn to you and say, 'rarrraghahagra'.    Jake, Probably the only guy i've held the hand of.&amp;nbsp; I truly enjoy the time (though too few in occasions), when we walk around the mall or walmart and make people despise youth.&amp;nbsp; I am my most insane when I am around you, and have fun every second of it.&amp;nbsp; Our conversations about teh awesomeness of Van's wings are unparalleled.&amp;nbsp; I remeber the time, seventh grade locker room before we went out for practice, "hey, cooper, you're wearing your necklace", "oh yeah, thanks".&amp;nbsp; Though you were spitting posion at me then.&amp;nbsp;    Shannon, you taught me that not all smart people are hating and evil.&amp;nbsp; You are funny, smart and all that stuff.&amp;nbsp; I miss teh good old days, having you wake up to me still playing some stuipd online game.&amp;nbsp; Sigh, nostalgia is a great thing indeed.&amp;nbsp; I can recall walking down the highschool hallways during the fish orientation and you saying to me, "Geeze bryan, when'd you become smart"&amp;nbsp; (answer is and was 'I didn't')    Matt R, Wow.&amp;nbsp; That's really all I can say.&amp;nbsp; You have shown me so many doors and helped me to do things I didnt' think possible.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for having faith in me.&amp;nbsp; I've said this before and I shall again, you are the single greatest youth minister that has ever come into being, I could only hope to live in your shadow.&amp;nbsp; I can recall my first bible study, the one on chastity, "well, what if your girlfriend breaks up with you on your birthday?", I asked, "well, seems like you have a little personal experience with that!"&amp;nbsp;    Jayci, You're so funny.&amp;nbsp; The fact that you spent time stalking me was flattering.&amp;nbsp; I wish I didn't wait until your senior year to get to know you, but hey, we are getting married next year right?&amp;nbsp; I can recall picking up my phone after your first call (I was afraid to answer), and your message was, "yeah, this is my office phone, so don't call back on it, or&amp;nbsp;my daddy will growl"    Jones,&amp;nbsp;Yo'ure hilarious.&amp;nbsp; Sorry about those carrots.&amp;nbsp; And i still dont understand your relationship with pat, its like nathan and I, only less making out.&amp;nbsp; And yes, I did say less.&amp;nbsp; I can recall spitting carrots on you... and then doing it again.&amp;nbsp; Sorry.&amp;nbsp;    Samantha,&amp;nbsp;Though our time spent together has been brief, I can honostly say that you are my new ethical role model.&amp;nbsp; I am amazed by your presence.&amp;nbsp; I can say with some certainty, you are the only youth in PoP who genuinely knows why you are there, and not just that, but that by you live by your desire.&amp;nbsp; I can recall after reconciliation, standing on the other side of the big room's divider, asking you, "have you seen the matrix?"... followed by you sending me to tears by saying no.    Emel, yes, that is the combination of Emily and Mel.&amp;nbsp; I regard them as a singular being because I NEVER SEE THEM APART.&amp;nbsp; Emel is so funny, she makes me smile.&amp;nbsp; Plus, who doesnt want a coochy tag every day?&amp;nbsp; I can recall... getting my penis tagged.&amp;nbsp;    Indeed, I have been influenced and loved by so many others, but if I was to write down all of these, there would not be enough bandwidth in the entire Internet to hold them.&amp;nbsp; (reference to the end of the Gospel of John)      This is my way of thanking you...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (Jayci) Questions answered... - 4/15/2004  This is a rather humorous set of questions put forth by my friend, whom I so respectfully named Joobs.&amp;nbsp;      What is your stance on me seducing you next year?    I believe you'll be too busy meeting new people and having fun at college to remember me at all.&amp;nbsp; However, given the unlikely scenario you put much thought into my life, and the very likely event that i'm still single... heck, anything that gets me out of being a priest.&amp;nbsp; Haha.    What do you want to be when you grow up?    Is this under the unrealistic assumption that I do grow up?&amp;nbsp; I intend on staying active with the church in some way.&amp;nbsp; My inital fear with volunteering for youth group, is that I'll undoubtablly be a single, middle aged man with a crappy job hanging around little kids.&amp;nbsp; Child molester anyone?&amp;nbsp; Seriously though, my current course of action is to go to college, fall in love with some beautiful/gamer/debater chick, who provides me with 2 healthy males, David Gregory Honeycutt and Jacob Timothy Honeycutt.&amp;nbsp; After college, I become a youth minister of some sort, and if not become a decan get a job where I can provide for my family, and my gaming addiction.&amp;nbsp; Followed by retirement on my soon to be 1million dollar IRA plan (cant withdraw money till i'm 65 though) and live happily with my still beautiful gamer wife.       Why do you think D is being so harsh lately?   I suspect it is a combination of many things.&amp;nbsp; Firstly is the fact that her star debater has chosen to fail which prevents him from achieving all he can in debate.&amp;nbsp; Thus, she i being even more biased against ben's favor.&amp;nbsp; And for whatever reason, she is shining that favor on Gaylor.&amp;nbsp; Secondly is the fact that she has realized that for 4 years, your class has gotten away with murder, and she hasn't done a damn thing about it.&amp;nbsp; What she failed to contemplate was that Ben and I had been the hardest workers in her class, and recieved NOTHING for it.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, when she initiated her 3rd Reich technique this semester, Ben and I went from working and succeeding, to giving up totally, and... passing barely.&amp;nbsp; So her entire plan was for nothing, because Mauro and Gaylor still do nothing, and Ben and I now do nothing.&amp;nbsp; And the reason she's screwing us out of the original "do nothing contract" is because it is indeed us and not Gaylor's team.&amp;nbsp; I suspect Kassie would be kicking her feet up on the desk had ya'lls team won.&amp;nbsp; I reason this by Kassies excused tardy today, whereas mine were also repremanded with signing the book, and Ben's just the same.&amp;nbsp; She expects more from us, but I'm unwilling to live up to this under the present situation.      My wisdom comes at a price, and that price is free...      &amp;nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (Nathan) Questions answered... - 4/15/2004  Nathan actually followed the prompt... I think.&amp;nbsp; Serious questions.&amp;nbsp; Three in number.&amp;nbsp; Nuff said.&amp;nbsp;      How have your parents affected your personality?    Hmm, but for the box of condoms and open beer policy my father has provided me?&amp;nbsp; Or my mom's reckless use of the words 'slutty and nuts'?&amp;nbsp; I think&amp;nbsp;subconciously my parents have always kept me on a straight path per se.&amp;nbsp; I havn't done drugs or gotten wasted simply because I couldn't look them in the eyes if I did.&amp;nbsp; I couldn't call them from the police station and say, I just shot somebody.&amp;nbsp; Obviously many other factors went into me choosing not to do these things, but when I was younger, and still today, it all boiled down to my my parents being ashamed of me.&amp;nbsp; But now I realize it's impossible to be ashamed of perfection.&amp;nbsp; so there.      What one person has influenced your life&amp;nbsp;as a moral individual?&amp;nbsp;    Ben.&amp;nbsp; His constant rants and raves on abortion, drinking and premarital sex last year in history is really what got me thinking.&amp;nbsp; I have always had a 'moral base', but it was he and jake that really helped me define who I was as a moral entity.&amp;nbsp; Jake showed me the aspect of drinking as a disgusting thing, Ben showed it to me as a harmful thing.&amp;nbsp;      Which of these holds the most important to you and why: Religion, education or Americanism (previously explained)?   As explained to me, Americanism is 'the act of being american'.&amp;nbsp; I will start with what I find to be the least important.&amp;nbsp; I believe education is of little importance to me.&amp;nbsp; There is a vast difference between being educated and being wise.&amp;nbsp; I do not believe I am well educated at all.&amp;nbsp; My high school carrer has been a joke at best.&amp;nbsp; And admitably, I am to blame entirely for this.&amp;nbsp; But I consider myself to be wise.&amp;nbsp; And i weigh wisdom, or the ability to contemplate abstract concepts and do things that are out of the norm, far above the ability to memorize and spit out information which has little substance.&amp;nbsp; My brother I can attest, has both great wisdom, and is highly educated.&amp;nbsp;    Despite what it may seem, my life as a Catholic does not dictate who I am.&amp;nbsp; My life as a moral and Christian entity dictates who I am.&amp;nbsp; I chose to make Christian and moral two seperate adjectives because too often in this world is the hollow affirmation of Christ held synonomous with morality.&amp;nbsp; There are other alternatives to teh Catholic Church which I would not consider to drastic.&amp;nbsp; Lutheran, or Catholic-Lites, share many practices with the Catholic Church.&amp;nbsp; I remain at the Catholic church because I belive religion is supposed to be where you are most comfortable.&amp;nbsp; If you are afraid of going to your church, then go to a different one, they are in no short supply.&amp;nbsp; My beliefs are my own, and though I am a Catholic, I do not believe all Catholic beliefs.&amp;nbsp; I am just the same an American, but I do not follow all American beliefs either, because there is no "America belief", just as there is no "catholic belief".&amp;nbsp; In the absence of religion, I believe the general morality of this world would be slightly changed if at all.&amp;nbsp;    The reason I chose Americanism is simple.&amp;nbsp; Lutheranism is very similar to the Catholic Church, but there is NO second to America.&amp;nbsp; No where else in this world can I be assured of similar health care, education (which is but a luxury to me now), military protection, etc.&amp;nbsp; God bless America.      Too long, heck, I got bored writing it...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Meditation on marraige vs priesthood... - 4/15/2004  The thought of becoming a priest never really even registered in my mind.&amp;nbsp; I mean, from the time I was four, it was understood that I would fall in love with someone, get married and raise kids.&amp;nbsp; There was no, "listen to the voice of God, who may be calling you to the preisthood".&amp;nbsp; That kind of talk was heresy to my father.&amp;nbsp; And indeed, the thought of wearing black all day and not ever being in love with a physical person, was unreal.&amp;nbsp; And yet, I befriended many priests on my way, not questioning their devotion to the church.&amp;nbsp;    It all started on my day of Confirmation (which happens to be someone's birthday, but I can't recall for the life in me).&amp;nbsp; The bishop gives his homily, and asks, "When did Jesus give the church the sacrament of Confirmation". Pentacaust pops into my head.&amp;nbsp; But obviously i had no intention of answering.&amp;nbsp; Well, Dave, my sponser and Matt's brother nudged me and said, "pentacaust" after some girl said something like, "the birth of Christ" which made no sense at all.&amp;nbsp; So I raised my hand and said pentacaust.&amp;nbsp;    After the mass, Chris who had Matt for his sponser, Matt, Dave and I all got to eat with the bishop and priests.&amp;nbsp; This wasn't a result of me answering or anything, I knew about this far in advance.&amp;nbsp; Just the week before, Father Clint, who I knew before he went to study at rome many years ago, gave a homily on Vocations to the priesthood and vocations in general.&amp;nbsp; And during the homily (which contained a minute matrix&amp;nbsp; reference) and also during the lunch, I was bombarded with the thought, "what if I am called to be a priest", "what if my absolute and total failure in maintaining, much less obtaining a relationship is a sign".&amp;nbsp; i wouldn't believe it though.&amp;nbsp; I tried desperatly to throw these thoughts out of my mind.&amp;nbsp; But the more I tried to get away from this 'vocation', the more it began to haunt me.&amp;nbsp;    Maybe I am meant to be a preist.&amp;nbsp; But maybe not.&amp;nbsp; I personally believe I have a&amp;nbsp; vocation to the married life.&amp;nbsp; To raise my kids and be a good father.&amp;nbsp; And Samantha even said, "Bryan, I don't think God wants to keep you from what you desire so much".&amp;nbsp; Which I can understand, but still, I'm constantly afraid now.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to be a preist at all.&amp;nbsp; But all the stories about how priests did all this discernment and crap, scares the living hell out of me.&amp;nbsp; My friends, i can honostly say I'm afraid.&amp;nbsp; I only hope, that ten years from now, i can look back on this entry and laugh with my pregnant wife and say, "I was worried for nothing".&amp;nbsp; But... I... just think.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to look back ten years from now and say, "wow, my fears were confirmed, as I dawn my priestly robes".&amp;nbsp; God... please send me someone.&amp;nbsp; Life is a long road, I don't want to brave it alone.&amp;nbsp;      Please, oh baby, don't go...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ahh, a good prodding at DBZ... - 4/15/2004  I just randomly found this quote on some british forum.&amp;nbsp; I couldn't stop laughing.    "On the next episode of Dragonball Q, Supersaiyan 8 Gogetahan and Cellza 22 join forces to fight Maajin Jesus!"    and for some other anti DBZ quotes    "HAHAHA Kakarot, now I am a SUPERSAYIN!!!", "yeah so am I", "so am I", "so am I", "yeah, me too"    "Oh no, you're blowing up the city.&amp;nbsp; we need to go to some place that's completely desolate and really huge like a bajillion miles wide and would never exist in real life but hey its right over there"    "AH-HAHAHAHAHA, I will destroy you all with my super powerful hands and my............... super powerful attacks!"    "Hehehehe, I can't do anything cause i'm just some lousey human... eh he heh... who's bald"    "yeah, nothing bad's gonna happen today" "he heh, yeah cause i'm cool"      hey guys, let's have a barbeque...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just here for future reference... - 4/16/2004  I just wrote 7 or so entries a good twenty four hours ago.&amp;nbsp; now, as I look at the computer screen, my mind goes blank.&amp;nbsp; I can't gather my thoughts together.&amp;nbsp; Each key is heavier and heavier.&amp;nbsp; Typing has become a chore now.&amp;nbsp; But that's how it usually is, it takes a good something to inspire me.&amp;nbsp; Usually its anger.&amp;nbsp; I hated something like work, and came here to vent about it.&amp;nbsp; I liked to think my frustrations were at least somewhat humorous.&amp;nbsp; I realize my life is in shambles and I'm never to find my 'companion'.&amp;nbsp; That's when I write best.&amp;nbsp; But now, when so many things are on my mind, I can't focus.&amp;nbsp; My arms are tired.&amp;nbsp; I need to lay down.&amp;nbsp;      May God grant me strength...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (Clawman) Questions answered... - 4/17/2004  Ben asked me three questions... so I'm going to answer them.&amp;nbsp; yeah, I'm cool like that.&amp;nbsp;      When do you get in a serious mood and what does it take to put you there?   I dont like being serious.&amp;nbsp; The most serious I do get is when speaking publically.&amp;nbsp; Even then, I try to lighten the mood by being somewhat sarcastic or joking.&amp;nbsp; It is because (as explained to me by Matt), that I am afraid of being vulnerable, and my sarcasm is a defense mechanism.&amp;nbsp; The best example of this, is that whenever given a compliment, I try to tear myself down.&amp;nbsp; But returning to the question at hand.&amp;nbsp; Whenever I am 'performing' for a group of people, be it during a debate, speech (like my hossum talk), or just during a group discussion for bible study, I maintain a semi-serious tone and am capable of expressing my truest thoughts.&amp;nbsp; end result... I am sooo cute (hah, i forget where/ when i started saying that)      If you could have got to know one person earlier in your life than you did, who would it be?   No one.&amp;nbsp; I am a firm believer that my life would be much different and possibly worse if I was to change some seemingly insignificant thing like that.&amp;nbsp; I would not risk the current friendships and relationships I have now, they are far to dear in my heart to me.&amp;nbsp; I do not believe getting to know someone is a matter of when, but a matter of getting to know them.&amp;nbsp; I am honored and blessed to have such great friends, and thank God for having such great role models to look up to.&amp;nbsp; Desepite what many of you (my friends) may think, you have all made a drastic impact on my life, and I cannot truly express the depth of my gratitude.      Where do you want to live when you move out of your parent's house and why do you want to live there?   Well, directly after moving out, my locality is of little importance.&amp;nbsp; I believe I can be happy wherever I am so long as I am in good company.&amp;nbsp; However, looking forward many years, to my retirement, I would say I would most love to live in my family's hometown of Walla Walla, Washington (pronounced WARSHington by the natives there, family included).&amp;nbsp; It's a very peaceful town, with a very stagnant population and great environment (ignoring the many immagrants who are associated with gangs and other illegal activity).&amp;nbsp; Plus, there's this place called Iceberg, where they make the absolute most divine milkshakes EVER.&amp;nbsp; I'm talking, Peanut butter/chocolate.&amp;nbsp; It'd be like watching every Matrix fight scene simlutaneously while also witnessing Sephiroth of Final Fantasy VII.      Ben, take my advice or DIE...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (Samantha) Questions answered... - 4/18/2004  These are the answers to the questions posed by my good church friend, and yes, i regard all friends who attend my church as church friends      What do you want to major in and where?   Well.&amp;nbsp; I still want to major in business or business law.&amp;nbsp; I feel that having a degree in that general field will make jobbing relativly easy.&amp;nbsp; And I'd also like to minor in theology, simply because I aspire to be a youth minister like matt.&amp;nbsp; As for the where, I really dont know.&amp;nbsp; Personally I would like to go to Baylor, simply because I've got bear (baylor's mascot) blood running through my veins now, what with greg and his wife to be.&amp;nbsp; My second choices would either be university of Dallas which is allegedly a Catholic school, or the University of Saint Thomas in Houston.&amp;nbsp; Saint Thomas looks nice b/c it would be very close to where Greg will be living, and not too far from home.&amp;nbsp; Dallas, well, basically my parents dont want to pay for baylor.&amp;nbsp; Their justification (which is not without validity) is that my work ethic is not great enough to drop 15,000 dollars a semester.&amp;nbsp; Oh well.      Do you want to ask Miss Jackie Ann out? Why or why not?   I think so.&amp;nbsp; After all, I have been looking for a smart girl, and for someone to be interested in me shows great signs of intellegence. Haha, that's my fear of vulnerability kicking in once more.&amp;nbsp; But let me tackle this question as seriously as I can.&amp;nbsp; Most likely, this information is new to most all of my secular friends (non church friends).&amp;nbsp; Obviously I would like to ask her out though.&amp;nbsp; But not at the present moment.&amp;nbsp; I would greatly prefer to simply get to know her and understand what makes her tick and become her friend before i become her boyfriend.&amp;nbsp; Granted, this will be difficult being the impation person that I am, but I just believe this is the best path to take.&amp;nbsp; I can only hope that her patience&amp;nbsp; can stand as much as mine can.&amp;nbsp; However, I would greatly like to pursue the possibility of a relationship with Miss Jackie Ann.&amp;nbsp; Heck, if we do go out i might have to call her "goddess of cute", now wouldn't that be a riot?      What is the most important part of our Catholic faith? To you that is.   Hmm, my Catholic faith.&amp;nbsp; I have a multitude of complaints with Catholicism that I shall not address at this time.&amp;nbsp; And despite what I like to believe, I'm very ignorant to Catholic doctrine and Biblical theology.&amp;nbsp; I think the paramount aspect of my Catholic faith is my continuous search.&amp;nbsp; The fact that the Church openly acknowledges the many mysteries of our faith.&amp;nbsp; My personal search is mostly through meditation and prayer.&amp;nbsp; The Eucharist is an example of this.&amp;nbsp; I am fully aware, mentally, that the Eucharist is the spiritual embodiment of Christ.&amp;nbsp; I understand on the concious level that though it does not become actual flesh, and real blood, it contains the essence of Christ as it did at the last supper.&amp;nbsp; But on the spiritual and unconcious level, I cannot grasp it.&amp;nbsp; Many people come to ecstasy in adoration of the Holy communion, but it does nothing for me.&amp;nbsp; I do it out of routine.&amp;nbsp; Not to say I dont believe, just that it doesn't spiritually affect me.      I hope I'm right about Jackie, say a prayer for me please...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (Unknown) Questions Answered... - 4/19/2004  Some unsigned person left me a series of... unique questions, which I suppose I have to answer anyway.&amp;nbsp; Plus they're funny and involve homosexuality.&amp;nbsp; Haha, I'm actually quite straight.&amp;nbsp;      1.&amp;nbsp;If you were shipwrecked on an uninhabited island which two friends would you want to be there with you and why?    No one.&amp;nbsp; Christ, if I brought ANY of my school friends to a deserted Island, I'd die so much faster.&amp;nbsp; Just to nae a few and the reasons associated with them.   Nathan- He'd be too busy arguing w/ me why he is the leader and why I suck that we'd never forage for food or try set a search light fire.&amp;nbsp; Plus he hasn't got any specs.&amp;nbsp;    Jake- He'd probably 'sneak' his way into a bear den, and consequently get mauled to death, followed by an angry bear who wants real meat... yeah that's right, me.   Bret- He'd get bored and leave.&amp;nbsp; Haha, he never did beat final fantasy VII... God bless it.   Ben-&amp;nbsp;His time would be spent with shannon on the phone explaining to her why she's dumb&amp;nbsp;for letting him&amp;nbsp;go on a trip with me.&amp;nbsp;    Gus- Would flail&amp;nbsp;his arms around until he passed out on the sandy beach and&amp;nbsp;get swept&amp;nbsp;away.&amp;nbsp;    Calvin- Christ, I can't even summarize what a hindrance he'd be.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;    2. If you had to choose one of the five senses to lose which one would you choose and why?    The only sense you don't need to game.&amp;nbsp; Smell.&amp;nbsp; In fact, gamin would be much easier without the sense of smell, because you could go for extended periods of time w/o showering and not smell yourself.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, I need the sense of seeing so I can drive and look at attractive ladies (only one now i guess, haha).&amp;nbsp; I need to be able to feel because I'd be the one who accidently puts his hand on the stove and doesn't realize it until I could smell the burning flesh.&amp;nbsp; I need the sense of hearing b/c how would I hear Sephiroth's Choir w/o it (Coos over sephiroth).&amp;nbsp; And I need teh sense of taste, so I can taste the sweetness of victory in every single argument that nathan and I have (but that's just my opinion).&amp;nbsp; haha, i'm such a bastard.      3. If you were gay, out of all your guy friends, who would you choose to be your significant other and why?    Now, my initial belief was Jake, because he is after all, buff, witty AND good looking.&amp;nbsp; But in retrospect, I will without a doubt say nathan.&amp;nbsp; Because I will be a good housewife, and he will be a rich millionaire lawyer who takes care of me.&amp;nbsp; But hey, jake and I DID hold hands once.&amp;nbsp; It was okay, i didnt sense that much chemistry... or DID I???      I am indeed attracted to the oposite sex...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (Jackie) Questions answered... - 4/21/2004  Just so everyone knows.&amp;nbsp; I met Jackie at battle of the bands by chance.&amp;nbsp; She's a freshman at Cy Fair, currently the most beautiful woman in my life right now, and my girlfriend, female friend, I realy dont knwo right now.&amp;nbsp; But oh well, I've ascended to a level of cuteness that the concerns of mortals is only something I regard for humor.&amp;nbsp;      What are your feelings on what happened and do you hate me for it?   To explain what just happened.&amp;nbsp; I asked Jackie out last night (4/20/2004), and she said yes.&amp;nbsp; Today, she conversed w/ her friends and came to the conclusion (which I was pushing for in the begining mind you), to cool down and get to know each other better.&amp;nbsp; I havn't even known her for a week yet, haha.&amp;nbsp; But on to the question.&amp;nbsp; As I told you on the phone,&amp;nbsp; I've overjoyed you decided this.&amp;nbsp; It shows me that you care about the 'us' and possiblity of a future 'us' to postpone this to better understand each other.&amp;nbsp; By no means do I bear any harsh feelings.&amp;nbsp;      What can I do to keep YOU smiling?   Share in my affection for you.&amp;nbsp; Don't lie, don't think I won't understand or believe you.&amp;nbsp; Keep your promise to me.&amp;nbsp; Help me live a chasteful life.&amp;nbsp; Tell me if something bothers you.&amp;nbsp; Listen to me if something bothers me.&amp;nbsp; Understand I am always willing to lend an ear to you, so long as you care to talk.&amp;nbsp; Keep your promise to me.&amp;nbsp; But above all else, share in my affection for you.&amp;nbsp; I will do all of these things because I am affectionate towards you.&amp;nbsp; Be affectionate.&amp;nbsp;      If you found out you were going to die today, who and what would you spend your day with?   I think I've been asked this question before, and its quite possible I wrote an entry about it long, long ago.&amp;nbsp; The answer has not changed.&amp;nbsp; I would say, without a doubt, my brother.&amp;nbsp; We'd go up to my room, watch the matrix fight scenes, play Street Fighter (and get my butt whooped as always) maybe a little mario kart (and whoop his but as always).&amp;nbsp; Then I'd probably tell my family good bye, and walk of into the sunset, Xylothin in hand.&amp;nbsp; Sigh, I hope I dont get forgotten      Keep your promise...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My thoughts while listening to Navras... - 4/22/2004    "When you walk away,     You don't hear me say,     "please, Oh baby.&amp;nbsp; Don't Go"    It is for this reason and this reason alone that I've stopped, or attempted to stop telling people when I want to go out w/ someone.&amp;nbsp; Because by the time I can utter a single word about how great this other person is, the relationship has crumbled to pieces.&amp;nbsp;    So I took my friend to her house after school today because her ride had ditched her.&amp;nbsp; And her home just happened to be connected to 290.&amp;nbsp; So I figured that I might as well just drop by Jackie's and say hello.&amp;nbsp; Well, using my excellent navigational skills, I successfully made it to her house.&amp;nbsp; I said hi to her mom and brother, then we went out and just talked next to her pool for about an hour.&amp;nbsp; During the course of the conversation she sneaks in the sentence, "yeah, i'm&amp;nbsp; not very good at relationships".&amp;nbsp; So I pry a little bit and ask just what she means by this.&amp;nbsp;    She then, at length explains to me she is no longer interested in having a relationship after it has begun, essentially she likes 'being into someone', but not going out with somone.&amp;nbsp; That really upset me ya know?&amp;nbsp; And she then started asking me if she upset me and all this, and the truthful answer was and still is, no.&amp;nbsp; She didnt' upset me because that's just the way she is.&amp;nbsp; For whatever reason, she's wired like that, just as I am someone whos adamantly afraid of rejection and betrayal (not without reason in my opinion).&amp;nbsp; But I am still upset.&amp;nbsp; She told me she'd think about it, and how she still really likes me, as I really like her.&amp;nbsp; Despite her attempts at comforting me, I know in the end, after months of waiting and contemplation, she's going to call me, or look me in the eye and say, "I'm sorry, this just can't work.&amp;nbsp; It's just the way I am".&amp;nbsp; Not to say I havn't any hope.&amp;nbsp; I suspect there is some reason for me meeting her.&amp;nbsp; Too many things which God and I am exclusive to went into me meeting this girl, and I believe she is special.&amp;nbsp;    Seriously though, the fates have and always will conspire against me.&amp;nbsp; Everytime I raise my arms in praise and thanks to God, i am struck to the ground for noticing my joys and gifts.&amp;nbsp; Everytime I think I might share in a relationship with someone, I am quickly halted to the grim reality that I am indeed alone.&amp;nbsp;    I've prayed so long, so hard for a relationship.&amp;nbsp; For love.&amp;nbsp; I have waiting my entire life, but I wish for that wait to be over.&amp;nbsp; Hope has betrayed me far to many times though.&amp;nbsp;     I still think you are beautiful, and you have made me smile since I met you, and you have not escaped my thoughts yet.&amp;nbsp; When you read this, don't believe I have given up on you, I have only given up on hope.&amp;nbsp;      Ásato ma sád gamaya...    &amp;nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My thoughts at Laser Quest... - 4/24/2004  Yeah, I just got home and I'm wasted like there's no tomorow.&amp;nbsp; Heck.&amp;nbsp; But yeah, i wrote this so she could it before I woke up.    Do you know that feeling, where you are surrounded by so many people, but you are so hopelessly alone?&amp;nbsp; Do you know it would only take one&amp;nbsp;glimpse of her face, one breath of her hair, one touch, to make my solitude vanish.    For seven hours I was&amp;nbsp;alone at Laser Quest and for seven hours, all I could think about was Jackie miracuously coming through those doors.&amp;nbsp; I'd run to her and hold her.&amp;nbsp; Everyone else would disappear.&amp;nbsp; Just she and I.&amp;nbsp; No words would be spoken, b ut she would say all i needed to hear.&amp;nbsp; I am so alone.&amp;nbsp; So alone.&amp;nbsp; So... alone.      I don't want to be alone anymore...   &nbsp;  Yet another day... - 4/24/2004  I know jake hates these kinds of entries.&amp;nbsp; The kind that basically retell my day and such, but to make him happier, I will reference to something only he and I would get.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since I was pretty much awake for 24 hours&amp;nbsp; and running around during laser quest (when i wasn't vomiting), my body is... well:&amp;nbsp; "My body isn't doing what I tell it to"... Blourgh!&amp;nbsp; Well, now for my day, that being the twenty third of april, two thousand four.&amp;nbsp;    Typical day.&amp;nbsp; Woke up about ten minutes late.&amp;nbsp; Picked Trey up and went to school.&amp;nbsp; I think I only slept in German (after actually doing a worksheet) and Physics (after doing the TAKS prep)... oh, and health too... after doing a current event on why ugly people should be against the law.&amp;nbsp; Haha, it was about a face lift for your voice so you sound younger.&amp;nbsp; I read the headline and explained how ugly people should be required by law to get stuff like this.&amp;nbsp; It was all just a bunch of BS to get a 100 on the current event.&amp;nbsp; Didnt really feel like thinking too much.&amp;nbsp;    Took Trey home after a lengthy conversation about the physics of DBZ, yeah, we're nerds.&amp;nbsp; I think I might have called Jackie once or twice and spoke to her for a little bit.&amp;nbsp; I'm so tired right now I can barely remember anything.&amp;nbsp; Fell&amp;nbsp;asleep and woke up around 5:30 to finish cleaning my bathroom before I headed off to Ben's birthday extravaganza.&amp;nbsp;    On my way to the ATM machine I called Jones up to tell her to have fun and prom and don't drink.&amp;nbsp; And its prom right now, so she'd better not be drinking and such.&amp;nbsp; What was supposed to be a 30 second conversation turned into some 10 minutes of her asking me about jackie and stuff like that.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, my mom's gonna kill me b/c of the phone bill.&amp;nbsp;    So I get to EB games so I can pick up ben's birthday gift (Advance Wars 2) and there's a sign saying the 'management' will be back in 5 minutes.&amp;nbsp; After about 30 minutes of waiting in my car, that stupid asshole (whom all of my friends are obligated to hate with a passion) comes out, takes the sign down and sell me my game.&amp;nbsp; Probably asked me for a damndable warranty.&amp;nbsp; I hate him.&amp;nbsp;    We all get to bennigans at about 7:30.&amp;nbsp; Shannon was late b/c of volunteering crap.&amp;nbsp; And because bret wanted to drive with someone.&amp;nbsp; Beats me.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, those in attendance included myself obviously, ben to my surprise, shannon, Corey for some reason, Johnny, bret as mentioned previously and Gus.&amp;nbsp; Before being seated (which must have taken eight hours) we reminised on Humanities, bsing work and other good times.&amp;nbsp;    As for dinner, all i can recall was hearing something hilarious and projecting my half chewed food clear across the table.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, that was embarassing.&amp;nbsp; And also the employees singing happy birthday to ben.&amp;nbsp; (the song was conspired by me, I am evil).&amp;nbsp;    Oh yeah, let me back up so I can rant and rave in anger a little bit.&amp;nbsp; Jackie and her girlfriends were going out to Hido for Sarah-Beth's birthday.&amp;nbsp; There was a thirty minute or so window between EB games and bennigans that I would have been able to drop by and say hello.&amp;nbsp; So I call her but to my dismay, sarah beth answers the phone and tells me its girls night out, and given the obvious observation that I am indeed a guy, or so i like to believe, I was not invited for any part of it.&amp;nbsp; Now, I dont typically complain about stuipd things, but I reasoned that five minutes of me conversing with Jackie, who lives a stars age away from me, would not defile the entire night.&amp;nbsp; But I was wrong apparently.&amp;nbsp; I literally drove past Hido (from EB) whimpering.&amp;nbsp;    In order to prevent Ben from paying for dinner, I tried to get him to come to my car so I could give him the birthday gift.&amp;nbsp; I threw shannon a twenty because I hadnt any smaller change (bearing in mind my meal was no more than ten dollars) and told ehr to give me my change back after tabulating my share of tip and ben's meal.&amp;nbsp; Out of that twenty, I GOT BACK NOTHING!!!&amp;nbsp; I was a little Irate, but didnt want decided to hodl back my adamant rage.&amp;nbsp; We then met at Netzone for some hardcore gaming.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I said it.&amp;nbsp; We played Call of Duty for about an hour then Corey went home.&amp;nbsp; The rest of us left for Jamba Juice (having heard it was far superior to Smoothie King).&amp;nbsp; Meh, it was okay, nothing too special.&amp;nbsp;    We sat out by starbucks b/c it had closed and after chatting for a few moments, my party dissolved leaving me to make my journey to Laser Quest.&amp;nbsp; The first day of my two day epic was over.&amp;nbsp; Instead of finishing it right now, i'm going to eat food.&amp;nbsp;      To be concluded...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My name, is Neo... - 4/26/2004  It's about 1:13 am right now.&amp;nbsp; I woke up so I could write this entry, read for fisher's test as well as Wendell's.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to do my precal, but the chances of that are happening are quite fat indeed.&amp;nbsp; Manyways, on to the topic of conversation tonight.&amp;nbsp;    Let's just consider this the introduction to my night of laser Quest.&amp;nbsp; As I've said before, next year at PoP, I will be one of the leading youth by default.&amp;nbsp; Since I'm the only junior who isn't habitually lost and I can be understood at regular intervals.&amp;nbsp; The only other junior is someone whom I shall address as Smith, because he is indeed my opposite.&amp;nbsp;    Smith is indeed a very conservative Catholic, who hails from a conservative home.&amp;nbsp; I'm the most liberal Catholic in existance, and my mom is the only Catholic who bears the name Honeycutt that I can think of.&amp;nbsp; Therefore he is much better recieved by the Youth and Adults there because they are all at similar wave lengths.&amp;nbsp;    Smith is a "praise n' worship" hotshot, who activly leads it before bible study.&amp;nbsp; I despise praise n worship and dont understand the greatness associated with repeating the verse, "oh I love Jesus, he's super holy and good", fifty times.&amp;nbsp; Once more, this is another thing that the adults and youth come to ecstasy over, and still I don't understand PnW, but oh well.&amp;nbsp;    The Smith family's roots are deep seated all throughout PoP.&amp;nbsp; By the time the last of his siblings are out of PoP youth, I'll be cashing my social security checks.&amp;nbsp; My family on the other hand, is small to begin with, and my brother was... not a popular youth when he attended PoP from what I understand.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, the Smith name is looked upon with some reverance, so his legacy rite is far greater than my own.&amp;nbsp; Plus everywhere I turn there's a smith (haha, like in the movie ya know?)    Outwardly, and alone, Smith treats others with respect and kindness, but as soon as he either encounters his 'better friends', or simply turns his back, his fangs are revealed and he pretty much hates everybody.&amp;nbsp; I on the other hand attempt to make it as plain as potatoes whom I like and dislike.&amp;nbsp; If I hate you, chances are I probably dont know your name, and if I do, I just won't talk to you period.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I among others have felt betrayed by Smith at times.&amp;nbsp; Curse his name as those who wrought his horrible existence!&amp;nbsp;    Lastly is the fact that Smith is all bouncy, cheery and charismatic.&amp;nbsp; During bible study he says things to the effect of, "yo, Jesus is like, totally my super good pal".&amp;nbsp; Or other things that have little substance behind it and are made simply to either draw a crowd, or simply remind him of his beautiful voice.&amp;nbsp; I on the other hand, am a crabby and methodic individual, who sits back and answers some questions, or gives some commentary with a bit of thought behind it, not to hear the sound of my voice which I already know is lovely, but because i am a damn genius (or so I like to think).&amp;nbsp; haha, yeah, that's right, if brains were biceps i'd pretty much be in the same category.&amp;nbsp;    Do I dislike Smith because he's fluffly and bubbly unlike me?&amp;nbsp; No, I dislike him because he quickly turns his back on you so soon as someone of greater importance walks by.&amp;nbsp; He has what I gave up when I started coming to PoP youth my freshman year.&amp;nbsp; A need to impress people.&amp;nbsp; It is because of this I believe that Matt regards Smith with more affection.&amp;nbsp; That to an extent saddens me, but I also believe Matt respects me more, because I am not hollow like Smith is.&amp;nbsp; So I like to think anyway.&amp;nbsp;      It ends tonight...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My days blur together... - 4/26/2004  I just finished my "my name is neo..." entry, so I put my neo sunglasses on, yeah, you know the ones.&amp;nbsp; I FEEL HOT!&amp;nbsp;    Thus is the conclusion of my two day trek.&amp;nbsp; Well, really all I'm going to do is relay the events that took place from the time I left Starbucks till i left laser quest.&amp;nbsp; Don't expect anything too fancy, remember, I'm not jesus... yet.&amp;nbsp;    So I bid Gus and Johnny farewell, and set forth to laser Quest.&amp;nbsp; Though it was not far away, I can never put enough doubt in my navigational abilities.&amp;nbsp; And much to my predition, I pull into the wrong entrance and have to circle around a parkling lot and back road to get near Laser Quest.&amp;nbsp; Did I mention I can't navigate?&amp;nbsp;    As I left Starbucks, I had called Jackie because I missed her at Hido.&amp;nbsp; Stuipd Sb, haha, j/k.&amp;nbsp; Apparently I had woken her up, but that only compensates for the three times she's called and woken me up.&amp;nbsp; Given the fact I'm asleep most all teh time, its not too hard though.&amp;nbsp;    I arrive at the entrance of LQ thirty minutes before the thing was predicted to start.&amp;nbsp; There was already a congregation of more PoP people whom I didn't care for that much.&amp;nbsp; Others I was able to enjoy the presence of for about ten minutes.&amp;nbsp; Now, there are some people I actually enjoy conversing with, Jacob Ramereiz to name just one... yeah, he's pretty&amp;nbsp; much the only one.&amp;nbsp; But much to my dismay, he had brought some friends from his school (which the name of it escapes me for a moment).&amp;nbsp; So not only am I stuck at a PoP function, where my only good friend is Matt, who is a fan of mingling, but the only person (except for matt), whom I can hold conversation with is w/ others.&amp;nbsp; So, I was damn alone, wishing I could call Jackie and ask her to come to LQ and keep me company.&amp;nbsp;    The first round, I was doing pretty crappy until halfway through the game, then it just went downhill from there.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I had been complaining about a tummy ache since I entered the doors.&amp;nbsp; Well, to keep the details at a minimum, my Jamba Juice didn't sit will with me, in fact, you might say I vomited in a corner.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, it wasn't too disgusting, I guess the fruitness was a benefit, but that doesn't eliminate the factor that it had been in my digestive track for about 40 good minutes.&amp;nbsp; So I'm looking for a way to hide it, but I soon realized that it was my moral obligation to bring it to Matt's, and later the employee's attention.&amp;nbsp; (hell, I"m sure they were glad to find that little bit out).&amp;nbsp; So I start asking this one girl to go find matt, and soon as she turns around, Matt comes flying through with a volley of laser blasts which didn't help the situation too well.&amp;nbsp; Matt was pretty funny playing.&amp;nbsp; he was swift like... well wind, which was my name.&amp;nbsp; After I got his attention...    "Yeah, matt, remember how I told you I had some Jamba Juice earlier?"    "You threw up didnt you?"    "um... well, actually... yes."    I was so emdamnbaressed.&amp;nbsp; I must have apologized fifty times over.&amp;nbsp; What sucked the most wasn't the throwing up, people do that all the time.&amp;nbsp; It was when matt and I were searching around for an exit and those sonsofbitches kept shooting us.&amp;nbsp; I mean we're walking, Gun in holster, and they shot us.&amp;nbsp; I hate people, I'd do away with them all if&amp;nbsp; I could.&amp;nbsp; Ya know, those Listerine Pocketpaks probably give you tounge cancer.&amp;nbsp; While we're on the subject.&amp;nbsp; Truthfully though, I wanted to leave after that first game.&amp;nbsp; But I had paid 20 hard earned rib tickler dollars to get in, and I'll be damned before I let that bitch Sylvia get the best of me!&amp;nbsp;    So while the second game (which consisted of the second group of PoP people) was going on, I was attempting to recooperate&amp;nbsp;and reading the bible.&amp;nbsp; Matt comes in and asks how I am and starts a mini bible study with me.&amp;nbsp; Who came to inturrupt to explain just how great he is?&amp;nbsp; None other than my great friend and colleague, Smith.&amp;nbsp; I mean, let's just ignore the fact that I was having a serious conversation with matt, I mean, Smith's need to explain how ugly and stupid he is outweighs my own.&amp;nbsp; Shortly after infecting Matt, Smith and he departed my presence, leaving me to be lonely again and wish jackie was there.&amp;nbsp; Damn, that was a sad series of events.&amp;nbsp;    The second game was more entertaining than the last.&amp;nbsp; I measure my LQ games now by the amount of vomit produced, the second game had none.&amp;nbsp; I was happy.&amp;nbsp; Plus, during the second half of the game, I came accross Lindsay East, who wanted to get a really bad score and lose that game.&amp;nbsp; We were very compatible, since my aim was to do very well and win that game.&amp;nbsp; So I dragged her corpse around shooting her every ten seconds, and shooting others (with her gun at times), yeah, dual wield capability, I felt Hot, not neo hot, but still hot.&amp;nbsp; I got third place and she got second to third, worked for me.&amp;nbsp;    By the last game, i was so damn tired I could care less what happend.&amp;nbsp; i think I had a gun.&amp;nbsp; Then I went home, wrote the "My thoughts at Laser Quest entry..." and fell asleep around 7:00 am.&amp;nbsp; It was damn fun, excluding the vomiting, lonliness and other crappy factors that made up the evening.&amp;nbsp; So basically I had fun for about an hour and a half, which was my time spent shooting people.&amp;nbsp; I'm hella tired right now.&amp;nbsp;      Wish I could prove I love you, but does that mean I have to walk on water...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  If I could have any fabulous power... - 4/26/2004  &nbsp;  Okay, so I'm talking to Jayci who totally DOESN'T want to kill Jackie.&amp;nbsp; And I learned what my true supernatural desire is.&amp;nbsp; We're talking about vomiting and hwo it sucks, and I said it would be cool if you could vomit money.&amp;nbsp; But it would be covered in bile and gross.&amp;nbsp; She then references to the fact that money does in fact dry.&amp;nbsp; My response is something to the effect of:    "So does looooove, baby" (said in deep black voice while soul music begins playing)    So there you have it, my ultra super power would be to have my voice become a sexy black man's voice (I'm thinking like teh Koolaide dude... only blacker) when talking to women, and during the conversation, soul music begins to play out of no where.&amp;nbsp; How awesome would that be?&amp;nbsp; Here is a completely realistic situation if I was to obtain this superhuman feat.&amp;nbsp;    Sir Bryan:&amp;nbsp; "heeeeeeey baby, I'm addicted to YOUR love" (deep sexy black man voice, while something barry white is in the background)    Hot woman:&amp;nbsp; "OOOOOH!&amp;nbsp; that sexy voice makes me even more attracted to you than I already was, and that sexy music from which I don't know the origin is getting me in 'tha mood'".&amp;nbsp; (begins drooling)    Sir Bryan:&amp;nbsp; "that's right, i'm in 'tha mood' too baby" (sexy black voice is still in effect)    Hot Woman:&amp;nbsp; "THA MOOD FOR SOME HARDCORE GAMING!!!"&amp;nbsp;    Yeah, that's right... that's like the hottest fantasy I can possibly fathom.&amp;nbsp; The only thing is, I have enough trouble beating hte hordes of women who are lusting at me now, so with the sexy black voice, I'll need armed guards just to hold the masses at bay.&amp;nbsp; *sigh*, such is the burden for being the most awesome human ever made by God's hands.&amp;nbsp; That's right, I said it, I am AWESOME!&amp;nbsp; haha, and terribly modest.&amp;nbsp;      That's gaaaaaaaaaaaay...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ben makes more sense than Nathan... - 4/27/2004  After setting forth the question, "Give me something random to complain about", (which now that I think about is actually a demand, not a question), I chose to listen to Ben over nathan.&amp;nbsp; nathan's idea was to complian about my small penis, which i still attest is bigger than Jake's.&amp;nbsp; Hah, he'll never live that down.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and tonight Jackie enquired whether or not Jake and I are gay together.&amp;nbsp; That made me laugh, of course we are... not, are not.&amp;nbsp;    Ben on the other hand gave me 3 good topics which I shall now piss and moan about.&amp;nbsp;      TARGET:   So I finished my TAKS test before most people in my room evolved to the point where they used pencils.&amp;nbsp; After a good 2 hour nap, I awoke to a slight krotchal vibration.&amp;nbsp; That would be target calling.&amp;nbsp; Apparently my background check hasn't gone in.&amp;nbsp; I really wanted to just say, "DO YOU THINK I'M&amp;nbsp;A DRUG HEAD?".&amp;nbsp; But I chose not to.&amp;nbsp; This doesn't make sense to me though, Rand turned in his application and pee cup a day after I did, and has been working for a week.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, Ben turned in his application and pee cup 2 weeks after I and already has a schedule.&amp;nbsp; WTF mate?&amp;nbsp;    Another reason for complaint are the stupid Orientation videos I was subjigated to.&amp;nbsp; It's like i was in the HJ being told to worship hitler and hate jews.&amp;nbsp; 2 things which I&amp;nbsp;do not do anymore... or ever in the past.&amp;nbsp; They were al fluffy and gay and I felt like my manhood was being stripped from me subconciously.&amp;nbsp; One of the demonstrations was to help 'buckle up infants in the shopping cart'.&amp;nbsp; Basically you have a child molesting 50 year old approach a shopper and attempt to buckle them up.&amp;nbsp; Here's what I'd do if I was the parent:    Creepy Diddler (dad's term for molester): *looks at infant* Say bucko, would you mind buckling up for me?    Me:&amp;nbsp; What in the hell?&amp;nbsp; Who are you?&amp;nbsp; Get away from my kid.&amp;nbsp; RAPE!!! SECURITY!!!&amp;nbsp; *grabs closest implement of destruction*&amp;nbsp; Take this you dirty Sonofab***h!!!&amp;nbsp; *Wacks diddler in face with stick*&amp;nbsp;    Security comes and witnesses dead employee    Guard:&amp;nbsp; Um, sir what happened?    Me: Uh... he had a gun, and touched my child with his penis... uh, yeah.    Guard:&amp;nbsp; Okay, here's ten million dollars to keep you from talking.    I wish all my stories ended with me getting lots of money.      TAKS:   MOTHER OF GOD!&amp;nbsp; If I could set the TAKS building on fire, I most certainly would.&amp;nbsp; It makes no sense to me at all to raise the difficultly of the stupid standardized test, but then lower the standards for passing.&amp;nbsp; And not only that, but I had to go through a insanely dumb space training program to 'learn how to take the TAKS test'.&amp;nbsp; Which is no different than the damndable TAAS test.&amp;nbsp; If I was he-man, i would (and seriously, this happened in one of hte older episodes), Dig my hands into the earth, and hurdle whatever chunkd of earth the "TAKS building" is attached to into orbit.&amp;nbsp; (seriously, he basically just threw a power plant into outer space, Heman is a hoss).&amp;nbsp;    But since my only super power is my sexy voice...    Guard approaches    Guard:&amp;nbsp; What the hell are you doing, this is a well secured TAKS area... you filth aren't allowed in    Me (in sexy black voice):&amp;nbsp; Oooh yeah, I'm thinking you need to look over there for some loooovin'. *points away from self*&amp;nbsp; Guard looks away.&amp;nbsp; *kicks guard in krotch and proceeds to do this to every guard in building*    Slightly attractive, but middle aged TAKS woman leader person:&amp;nbsp; How did you get past the guards?    Me (sexy voice still active):&amp;nbsp; Let's just say I...&amp;nbsp;say, you're one&amp;nbsp;foxy lady.&amp;nbsp; how about you set this building on fire, and wecan&amp;nbsp;go back to my place... OOOH YEAH!!! SWEETLOVIN'.&amp;nbsp;    *woman sets building on fire, followed by me kicking her in krotch and running off into sunset*      JOHN KERRY:   He's a stupid liberal, abortion supporting Catholic. Damn dirty catholics... wait NO!      Get ready for my mad grrr...      &amp;nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Dark City Treno... - 5/5/2004  Very rarely am I inspired to write.&amp;nbsp; Usually it's when I'm mad and need something to complain about.&amp;nbsp; Sadly enough, whenever I feel like total crap and want to kill myself, Examples being Quiznos and rib tickler, everyone has a jolly good laugh.&amp;nbsp; Maybe my misfortune is hilarious, I dont know. But that is not the topic at hand.&amp;nbsp;    It's about 1:30 am, I'm close to finishing up my English CC final (which I am damn proud of as of now).&amp;nbsp; I've been thinking of a way to express my feelings towards/about Jackie.&amp;nbsp; I've referenced to her in several entries, whereas her last 5 or 6 have practially been exclusivly geared towards me.&amp;nbsp; Haha, i'm so lucky.&amp;nbsp;    Love.&amp;nbsp; No, I couldn't possibly make such a claim so soon into knowing her.&amp;nbsp; I once thought I could, but I soon realized how childish and arrogant that would be.&amp;nbsp; I love many people, but I will have my 'Love' resereved for but one person in this world, who I may not even know yet.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, she is on my mind when I wake up, when I go to sleep, when I take my tests, when I pray.&amp;nbsp; To use a&amp;nbsp;matrix quote to describe her presence in my mind:      "You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.",&amp;nbsp; Morpheous    I felt really crappy when I couldn't take her to bible study today.&amp;nbsp; We go to different schools so I rarely get to see her.&amp;nbsp; For her birthday (may 9th), i'm taking her out this saturday, and I know the word, "uberromanticest-date" has been thrown around alot lately, but I can safely say this will indeed be the uberromanticest-date ever.&amp;nbsp; Haha, that was a simpsons reference.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, she still has NO idea what we're doing... and to a lesser extent teh same hold trues for me.&amp;nbsp; Meh, Oh well.&amp;nbsp; Just felt like writing this down so she knows how i feel.&amp;nbsp; Farewell my friends.&amp;nbsp;     Time to finish my english...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Before I die... - 5/5/2004  I was reading over a note jake left me a while back, and it made me think of what I'd do before I died... BAsically this is my last day on earth, and the cops have basically said I can do whatever the heck i want.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I'm cool like that.&amp;nbsp;    So I start off my day to a nice bowl of Apple Jacks, get showered, typical routine.&amp;nbsp; Here is where my day kicks off    I go to my local wal mart, and purchase a trench coat and a gun with lots of bullets.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, you can buy guns at walmart now.&amp;nbsp; Jake can tag along if he wants, basically most of my day will include me shooting stuff with my gun and saying cool stuff like, "You're dead...", "let's get the hell out of here", and of course, my all time favorite, "let's go".    I'd then pick Smith up, and drive to somewhere where we have a nice city block free, and its raining of course.&amp;nbsp; jake, who is still tagging along mind you, has a stereo with "Neodammurung" in playing really loudly.&amp;nbsp; And if there's no lightning he'll have ot make thunder sounds too.&amp;nbsp; Jake's a good guy, I like him enough.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I walk up to Smith and say, "it ends tonight".&amp;nbsp; We start running at each other in the rain preparing to get in a big kung fu fight.&amp;nbsp; But before he reaches me I pull out my gun and wail on him.&amp;nbsp; Haha, I play dirty.&amp;nbsp;    So then I go to Jackie's.&amp;nbsp; Jake could still be with me... hell if I know.&amp;nbsp; We then 'drive off into the sunset'... Hmm, towards, OH YEAH!&amp;nbsp; For whatever reason, Smith is actually quite alive and in the last 2 hours came to the control of a big crime syndicate.&amp;nbsp; Well, I leave jackie in my car, tell her i'm 'going out for some gum'.&amp;nbsp; I walk into the crime syndicate and systematically blow everything up.&amp;nbsp; Smith is at the top waiting with a sword for some reason,&amp;nbsp; yeah, i blow that up too and shoot him again.&amp;nbsp; I stumble down because I let some bullets hit me I guess.&amp;nbsp; Federal agents are standing outside waiting for me with guns and stuff, yeah, about to kill me.&amp;nbsp; I lift up my hand and before collapsing and dying say...      Bang...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Don't be a dentist drill... - 5/6/2004  So today in history class, the year almost done winding down.&amp;nbsp; My final test is tomorow (which I am well prepared for).&amp;nbsp; Fisher decided to leave our class with but one last sermon containing the greatness of her infinite knowledge of this realm.&amp;nbsp; The topic, "dont be a dentist drill".&amp;nbsp; It basically said, "don't complain to people a lot because you have no idea what circumstances surround their outside life".&amp;nbsp; She obviously used the example of bugging a teacher about getting grades.&amp;nbsp; I mean after all, the teacher may have cancer, a cheating spouse, or maybe they spent an entire weekend in devotion to others.&amp;nbsp; I think the sermon was infact very true, I dont know the personal life of my teachers and sometimes my friends, and in many cases, I either dont want to know or dont care.&amp;nbsp;    Good message, wrong person to deliver this message.&amp;nbsp; Fisher, in my personal opinion, has two eyes, one is fake, and only sees what goes on inside the walls of her classroom.&amp;nbsp; the other one is the gossipy eye, which can only see the dirt that others surround themselves in.&amp;nbsp; So unless you do very well in her class, or just happen to have the lastest scoop on who got drunk/or pregnant the weekend prior, you are disliked.&amp;nbsp; Ben and I are perfect examples of this.&amp;nbsp; Fisher doesn't have the damndest clue what any of us, especially I do with my life.&amp;nbsp;    Enter February Challenge.&amp;nbsp; I delievered my Prayer talk, 30ish minutes if my prediction is correct, pretty indamntense.&amp;nbsp; I was dead bug that weekend, maybe got 8 good hours of sleep.&amp;nbsp; I was doing good for others I'd like ot think, I may not have had any converts in my small group this time, but I pretend i made a difference.&amp;nbsp; The monday following challenge, Fisher slaps some boring and moronic packet on our desks (probably had to do with feminism or some other useless peice of history, haha, j/k).&amp;nbsp;    Before I go any further, I would like to comment that this infact an unfabricated story, this is true as can be.&amp;nbsp; So I begin to nod off and lay my head on my desk knowing full well Fisher allows for everyone to come in after school and complete their packets.&amp;nbsp; While I am attempting to sleep, some drunkard DIRECTLY in front of me is LOUDLY conversing about his sexcapades and intoxicating weekend.&amp;nbsp; Fisher looks directly at me and goes, "bryan, since you have chosen to not do your packet today, I will not allow you to come after school to work on it, period."&amp;nbsp; Let's just ignore the fact that I probably accomplished more on that packet than the drunkard in front of me.&amp;nbsp; Those minor details are of little importance.&amp;nbsp; So I show up after school to attempt my packet, I was slightly more fresh that time... Fisher screams at me to get out, but on my way out the door, I notice the drunkard from before is dilligantly working on his packet.&amp;nbsp; Injusitice anyone?&amp;nbsp;    Am I mad because my weekend was spent doing something more... ethical than the drunkard's?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; Am I mad because Fisher most likely attends church simply for the satisfaction of refuting the word of God given her feminine omnipotence?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; (but i think she's so damn full of herself its amazing she doesnt float away).&amp;nbsp; I am mad as HELL because Fisher NEVER practices what she preaches.&amp;nbsp; She is a GREAT teacher whom I've learned a hella lot from, but a BAD person.&amp;nbsp; It's a damn surprise that woman got married, what how high her horse is and her adamant hatred for men.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and she supports abortion.&amp;nbsp;      I dont bitch or moan, I rake muck...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  Melodies of life part I... - 5/6/2004    Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark,For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart.To weave by picking up the pieces that remain.Melodies of Life - Love's lost refrain.   I do not consider myself an attractive person.&amp;nbsp; All that 'lord of cute' rhetoric is mostly just compensation.&amp;nbsp; I believe I would become enraged and kill if I was forced to spend long periods of time with myself.&amp;nbsp; I can be an ass sometimes, if that irregularly.&amp;nbsp;    I am not a 'ladies man'. I've had 4 relationships during the entirty of my life, probably accumulating to two months of being in a relationship.&amp;nbsp; I've prayed more than most to be with someone.&amp;nbsp; Heck, I've probably put forth four rosaries (most cherished form of prayer) to try and find inspiration or something.&amp;nbsp; Patience, that's all i come up with.&amp;nbsp;    One week or so this girl contacts me.&amp;nbsp; I had wanted to start a relationship with her in the past, but she basically cut off all contact with me and was more of a socialite than i was to begin with.&amp;nbsp; So out of the blue she wants me to go out with her.&amp;nbsp; At this point in time, I suspected nothing would hurt, I suppose that was just one of my weak moments in ethics.&amp;nbsp; So I agreed to the date.&amp;nbsp; It was supposed to be right before battle of the bands.&amp;nbsp; My shift didnt start until 7pm so I figured I could sit and chat with her for a while.&amp;nbsp;    You could say it was wednesday before that inspiration struck me.&amp;nbsp; I was getting into this for the wrong reasons.&amp;nbsp; Thursday I explained how I'd have to cancel so I could go to church earlier.&amp;nbsp; This was not a lie, it was an escape you could say.&amp;nbsp; I guess you could say i'm trying to be a better person.&amp;nbsp;    I took a nap after school friday.&amp;nbsp; Meant to wake up around five.&amp;nbsp; Woke up around 6:30.&amp;nbsp; Sped&amp;nbsp;down to church, paid my ten dollars to volunteer.&amp;nbsp; Never did quite understand that.&amp;nbsp; I go to check out where I'm working, and then search for someone to socialize with.&amp;nbsp; Since I have so few friends at PoP, that tends to be difficult.&amp;nbsp; First person I see is Sam and her posse of girls.&amp;nbsp; I ask her about the Matrix which I had recently shown to her, and then proceed to ask if any of her friends had seen it.&amp;nbsp; One of her friends jumps from the bench and nearly tackles me screaming, "I HAVE!!!".&amp;nbsp; So we sat down and conversed about it for a while, Sam took off somewhere.&amp;nbsp; She told me her name, I didnt really remember.&amp;nbsp; Cute girl though, coulda sworn she was a junior.&amp;nbsp;    Afterwords, I leave to go deliver a flashlight to the entrance.&amp;nbsp; It was getting pretty dark.&amp;nbsp; I saw Em and Stephanie there, good friends, so we chatted about this and that for a while.&amp;nbsp; My pants started to vibrate, it was chris.&amp;nbsp; Not much of a surprise.&amp;nbsp; he calls alot.&amp;nbsp; So I pick up and he says, "where are&amp;nbsp;you, we need to talk"... we need to talk alot apparently.&amp;nbsp; So he comes, snatches me from the entrance and I ask what the topic of conversation is.&amp;nbsp; "man, she totally likes you!".&amp;nbsp; Wha, who?&amp;nbsp; "Uh... samantha's friend". Oh... who?&amp;nbsp; "Iduno, I think&amp;nbsp; her name is Jennie or something, Heck, I thought she was our age".&amp;nbsp; Well okay, lets go see her.&amp;nbsp;    So Chris and I frockle our way over to that Jennie girl, I got detured a little bit, but we reached her eventually.&amp;nbsp; Turns out her name's Jackie.&amp;nbsp; Coulda fooled me.&amp;nbsp; So I start talking to her, and within about 20 seconds she has my cell phone, and putting her number into it.&amp;nbsp; Maybe that's how I learned her name.&amp;nbsp; So this Jen... Jackie girl is making small talk with Chris and i.&amp;nbsp; I think she must have said uber like three times, I thought that was pretty funny.&amp;nbsp; I explain my adamant love for my Atari PoP shirt, and gaming.. and basically everything that isn't cool in this world.&amp;nbsp; Did I explain I'm not a ladies man?&amp;nbsp; At some point I put my number in her phone, she then tells me that, "i'll never ever call her" or something like that.&amp;nbsp;    Well, the very fact that this cute girl is obviously chasing after me was interesting, so I reply, "heck, I'll call you as soon as I pull out of the parking lot".&amp;nbsp; I dont think she believed me.&amp;nbsp;    Battle of the bands came to&amp;nbsp;a close, so Sam, Jackie and the rest of hte posse came to bear witness to the greatness of my crappy car.&amp;nbsp; She sat on the hood in some sort of temptress style.&amp;nbsp; I think that's where Jake jumped on and effectivly scratched off half my car's paint.&amp;nbsp; Jackie and I step out of the crowd to converse about things for a brief period.&amp;nbsp; We sit on the curb and she asks me, "what'd everyone tell you".&amp;nbsp; Well, that you have a thing for me I guess. "oh, well Im pretty forward, so yeah... i'm into you".&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I suppose I am as well, but I personally would like to take things slowly (goes into boring schpeal).&amp;nbsp; "yeah, I agree, so are you going to call me?"&amp;nbsp; I said I would.&amp;nbsp;    Then I saw her and Sam's posse off, went to clean up and went to my car.&amp;nbsp; Well, I almost wee'd myself when I discovered a lack of keys in my pocket.&amp;nbsp; I'm jumping up and down, near swearing when Mr. Franz goes, "hey, are these yours?"&amp;nbsp; Christ, THANK YOU SOO MUCH!!!&amp;nbsp; where'd you find them&amp;nbsp;"oh, over on the curb".&amp;nbsp; damn...    So I get in my car, and drive off onto 249.&amp;nbsp; I called her and got hervoice mail orsomething.&amp;nbsp; Why do people doubt me so much?&amp;nbsp; So her name's Jackie...      To be continued...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Melodies of life part II... - 5/7/2004    Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark,For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart.To weave by picking up the pieces that remain.Melodies of Life - Love's lost refrain.    Jackie hmm.&amp;nbsp; Well I go home and log on to AIM, a rare event. Ha.&amp;nbsp; I was talking to Sam and Jackie for a little bit.&amp;nbsp; I think we made plans for me to take her to her Bible study tuesday night.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I picked Sam's brain about Jackie.&amp;nbsp; Ya know, what's her ethical base, what crowd circles she's in.&amp;nbsp; That stuff.&amp;nbsp; Apparently during the course of the night, I was refered to as, "The God of cute", and "The hottest thing ever".&amp;nbsp; So I figure any girl who thinks that about me has to be a amazingly brilliant.&amp;nbsp; Ha.&amp;nbsp; My mom probably told me to get offand sleep.&amp;nbsp; I dont think I did.&amp;nbsp; I went to bed eventually.   I called her during that weekend to talk about dumb things.&amp;nbsp; Nothing of any real value, just to talk to her I guess.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to go out, Tuesday I figured.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to do it in person.&amp;nbsp; Got a map to her house, found out I had to commute on 290.&amp;nbsp; Now, to me, 290 is like the Matrix Reloaded freeway.&amp;nbsp; It basically means certain death for me.&amp;nbsp; The very fact that I got to her house unscathed I believe is the direct intervention of God.&amp;nbsp; No saints, no angels.&amp;nbsp; God personally came down to get me there.&amp;nbsp;    Apparently right after Battle of the Bands, she told her mom how she likes me, and how happy I make her.&amp;nbsp; That's cool, my mom didn't find out until having known her for 3 weeks.&amp;nbsp; So I get in her house, recieve a quick tour.&amp;nbsp; Nice house, big and pretty.&amp;nbsp; She had more shoes in her closet than I have in my entire house though.&amp;nbsp; I take her to her brother's baseball game so I could see her mom and younger brother.&amp;nbsp; Her brother is like an allstar athlete, big sports fan.&amp;nbsp; I guess she saw that in me too, what with my complete lack of physical talent and apathy towards sports.&amp;nbsp; Her mom was very sweet, I was pretty goofy.&amp;nbsp; I hoped I made a good impression.&amp;nbsp;    We make our way down 290 again (God still driving) and I had told her the weekend prior that I had a question for her.&amp;nbsp; So she'd kept bugging me about the question and all.&amp;nbsp; First thing I asked her is if she drank.&amp;nbsp; Said she did it once, a year ago.&amp;nbsp; I said, "i know you hate crying, but the one thing that would&amp;nbsp;bring me to tears would be you drinking".&amp;nbsp; I made her promise not to ever again.&amp;nbsp; She didnt like that, probably thought I didnt trust&amp;nbsp;her.&amp;nbsp; So then my question.&amp;nbsp; "will you go out with me".&amp;nbsp; Well of course she said yes, if you didnt know she would you're dumb.&amp;nbsp;    She explains how its hard for her though, she doesn't want her heart broken, she doesn't want me to be disloyal.&amp;nbsp; I look her straight in the eye and with all the sincerity in my body say, "never again will you have someone as loyal as me.&amp;nbsp; The mere thought of being dishonost, loyal or cheating is so painful to me I cannot even imagine it.&amp;nbsp; And I hope the same holds true for you".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I don't think&amp;nbsp;she believed me.&amp;nbsp;    We get to bible study, which I knew going in would not even compare to Matt's bible studies.&amp;nbsp; But I did it just as an excuse to go see her.&amp;nbsp; I laid next to her on a pillow the whole time. During praise 'n worship I tried to touch her hand, hold it maybe.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, that didn't work out so hot.&amp;nbsp; She kept leaning over saying, "what do you want?".&amp;nbsp; Hell, what was I supposed to say?&amp;nbsp; "PUT YOUR HAND IN MINE NOW!!!"&amp;nbsp; So&amp;nbsp;I drive her home. And give her a goodbye hug.&amp;nbsp; She might have said she had a great time.&amp;nbsp; Iduno, maybe.&amp;nbsp;    I suspect God got tired of driving me to her house.&amp;nbsp; So within two turns, I realized i had no idea where I was.&amp;nbsp; It was dark and I was in an unknown part of the world.&amp;nbsp; I called ben and Jayci to bitch and yell.&amp;nbsp; I probably swore more that 30 minutes of trying to get out of fairfield than I ever have... ever.&amp;nbsp; After that, I get back on 290 (hell's freeway) and fail to navigate on there as well.&amp;nbsp; I had to exit onto telge, and got lost on that road as well.&amp;nbsp; I got home around ten.&amp;nbsp; I ran upstairs and got online.&amp;nbsp; No jackie.&amp;nbsp; Oh well, I went to bed.&amp;nbsp;    I get a phonecall from her that wednesday.&amp;nbsp; Probably before bible study.&amp;nbsp; She tells me she wants to stop going out.&amp;nbsp; She wants to take things slowly and get to know me better.&amp;nbsp; Follows up by asking if i'm mad five thousand times over.&amp;nbsp; I thought it was sweet.&amp;nbsp; The first break up.&amp;nbsp;    That thursday, I was walking out to my car when this girl (who met me at rib tickler and wants me to ask her out... almost did) asked me for a ride home.&amp;nbsp; Her's had ditched her.&amp;nbsp; I must be physically incapable of not taking people home.&amp;nbsp; I think its a damn disease.&amp;nbsp; So I take her home, and I realize how close I am to 290.&amp;nbsp; So I drop her off and call jackie to inform her i'll be at her house in about ten minutes.&amp;nbsp; Unknown to me, she basically exploded in a firery rage trying to get 'prettied up' before I came over.&amp;nbsp; She looked fine.&amp;nbsp; Jackie and her mom thought my blue shirt that day was hot.&amp;nbsp; I liked the black turtle neck better.&amp;nbsp; She wants to set it on fire.&amp;nbsp;    We go sit by her pool and talk about cats, school and she asks me if im mad at her again.&amp;nbsp; Still pretty cute.&amp;nbsp; Then she comes out and says, "i'm bad at relationships".&amp;nbsp; Obviously I inquired why.&amp;nbsp; "I dont know, I just stop liking a guy after we go out, i'm not sure if I can be a good girlfriend.&amp;nbsp; dont hate me.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure why".&amp;nbsp; Well didnt that just put me in a shitty mood.&amp;nbsp; I did my best to put a smile on my face.&amp;nbsp; Nothing's like hearing, "as soon as we go out, I'll like you less".&amp;nbsp; I wonder if she noticed how distraught I was.&amp;nbsp; Maybe, she didn't believe I'd be loyal to her.&amp;nbsp;    While I'm driving home, I play "simple and clean" really loud.&amp;nbsp; in fact, i'm listening to it right now.&amp;nbsp; That's my favorite angsty/happy love song.&amp;nbsp; I tried to hold back my emotions.&amp;nbsp; It was easy waiting a few months before we go out, I couldn't possibly stand waiting a few months and then realizing she doesnt like me.&amp;nbsp; I think she likes me, I mean she thinks i'm attractive for some reason, and laughs at me on occasion.&amp;nbsp;    I got home and sat on my toilet listening to Navras, putting my mind in order, trying to figure out what the hell I'm doing wrong or what I should be doing.&amp;nbsp; So I wrote, "my thoughts while listening to Navras".&amp;nbsp; Shortly thereafter,&amp;nbsp;I went downstairs to eat, and watched TV with dad for a few hours, now that was a rare occasion.&amp;nbsp; I get upstairs to find I missed 3 or so phonecalls from Jackie, all basically saying how she's so sorry, crying and a bunch of other unhappy things.&amp;nbsp; Well I feel like shit again, this isn't my day.&amp;nbsp; I get online, her live journal says the same thing basically.&amp;nbsp; I called her cell phone, Christ I felt bad.&amp;nbsp; Cell phone was busy, i was hesitant to call her home phone, it was pretty late.&amp;nbsp; Her mom picks up, and says somethign like, "its okay jackie, shh, its okay".&amp;nbsp; She was crying in the background.&amp;nbsp; Did I mention the shit i was feeling like?&amp;nbsp;    Through the tears, she tried to explain how she doesn't want to lose me and how i make her feel happy.&amp;nbsp; Less shitty.&amp;nbsp; I must have said "Jackie... I'm sorry", five hundred times.&amp;nbsp; I know she didnt want me to say it, but I had to.&amp;nbsp; I felt like shit.&amp;nbsp; I tried explaining the intent of that entry.&amp;nbsp; Didnt work to well.&amp;nbsp; I told her I'd never intentionally do anything to hurt her.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure she believed that either.&amp;nbsp;    I made Jackie cry though.&amp;nbsp; My stomach felt it was going to curl up and explode.&amp;nbsp;     To be continued...    &amp;nbsp;  &nbsp;  Melodies of life part III... - 5/8/2004    Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark,For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart.To weave by picking up the pieces that remain.Melodies of Life - Love's lost refrain.   I'm not much of a reading fan.&amp;nbsp; Never have been nor will I.&amp;nbsp; So let's skip a few chapters of this novel I call my life.&amp;nbsp; Rand and I are in my car driving away from Jackie's, on our way to Starbucks to continue studying for the history exam.&amp;nbsp; She had called and left a voice message about halfway through the drive.&amp;nbsp; So I pick up my phone and listen Jackie in a rather solemn tone, "bryan, whenever you are alone, call me. we need to talk".&amp;nbsp;    Now, any guy wiht a head on their shoulders knows full well what that means.&amp;nbsp; So during the rest of the ride home, I did my best to provide the illusion to Rand that I was just fine.&amp;nbsp; I couldnt understand him as he asked the questions, i was so internally distraught.&amp;nbsp; I tell him to wait for me in starbucks as I call her.&amp;nbsp;    "Bryan, I still think we're moving to fast.&amp;nbsp; I want to get to know you better".&amp;nbsp; Aren't those just words that put you in a good mood?&amp;nbsp; She still wanted to go out with me for her birthday and red carpet affair though.&amp;nbsp; So I suspected and hoped that there was some flicker of chance left.&amp;nbsp; Didn't I resolve to abandon hope long ago?&amp;nbsp;    I drove up to her house listening to Melodies of Life.&amp;nbsp; I had intended to get her two roses tonight.&amp;nbsp; Glad I didn't.&amp;nbsp; I walk in, give her mom a hug, then Jackie.&amp;nbsp; As we step out the door, I wave good bye to her mom and Jackie says, "Bryan, we need to talk".&amp;nbsp; Mokay, I figured we would, wouldnt drive off into the sunset silent anyway.&amp;nbsp; So I open the car door for her and drive off.&amp;nbsp;    "Im sorry bryan.&amp;nbsp; I lied to you, I dont want a boyfriend right now.&amp;nbsp; All I want is a friend.&amp;nbsp; It's not anyone else.&amp;nbsp; Don't be mad at me".&amp;nbsp; Bull fucking shit.&amp;nbsp; She told me within a few blocks of her house.&amp;nbsp; It took every ounce of willpower left in my frail existence to not turn my car around and drop her off at her doorstep.&amp;nbsp; I pull into AMC 24, and get two tickets for Law of Attraction (13 dollars).&amp;nbsp; Good movie, ironically it dealt with working hard and fighting for relationships.&amp;nbsp; Must not have sunk in.&amp;nbsp; No matter.&amp;nbsp;    I drive her home directly after the&amp;nbsp; movie.&amp;nbsp; I intended to have dinner with her, but I did what I could to get out of that.&amp;nbsp; Didn't feel like paying for dinner, or waiting to get home any longer.&amp;nbsp; I did my best to talk to her.&amp;nbsp; I spoke nothing but rhetoric to her, firstly so my head wouldnt explode with rage, and secondly so she wouldnt feel as bad as I wanted to make her feel.&amp;nbsp; Make her feel as shitty as I did for three days, waiting to find out her answer.&amp;nbsp;    So do I feel cheated for spending a quarter tank of increasingly expensive gas, and 13 dollars on a movie, so I could obtain information that would have better recieved over a 2 minute phone conversation?&amp;nbsp; Yes I do.&amp;nbsp; Am I wildly upset and furious?&amp;nbsp; Yes.&amp;nbsp; Jackie said all she wants is just a friend, but quite frankly, I'd just be another one of her many guy friends.&amp;nbsp; And if she tried to attatched some emotional crap to our 'friendship' than it would cease to be a friendship, and thus become&amp;nbsp;a a relationship, but that is in fact not waht she wants.&amp;nbsp; She tells me she didnt think i'd want her to be unhappy in the relationship, or lie for that matter.&amp;nbsp; Yet, almost immediatly thereafter she told me she doesn't want me to be angry with her.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So should I then lie and say I'm quite alright with her decieving me?&amp;nbsp; Should I lie to her so she is happy?&amp;nbsp;      "Prick us do we not bleed, tickle us do we not laugh, wrong us do we not revenge".&amp;nbsp;    I am angry that she broke up with me.&amp;nbsp; I was upset when I made her cry the first time, but if she reads this, and understands my true pain and anger and then cries, it is no longer my burden.&amp;nbsp; Law of attraction was about fighting for love, not giving up.&amp;nbsp; I extended myself as far as I could, lept every hurdle, climed every mountain, she did nothing.&amp;nbsp; So no, I shall not cry with her this time, this time I did all that I could, and that it seems, was simply not enough.&amp;nbsp;    So I bid this entry, and chapter of my life farewell, Im off to do the only thing that can brighten my mood.&amp;nbsp; I'm off to game.&amp;nbsp;      In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me?Was it fate that brought us close and now leaves me behind?     And he walks off into the day's sunset, alone...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Movie preview this! (exposes middle finger)... - 5/8/2004  I swear, if there is one especially crappy thing about going to movies, it's not the insane prices, its not paying for a girl who plays on her cell phone the whole time, or someone who broke up with you ten minutes before.&amp;nbsp; Its not even the idiots who are talking and laughing throughout the entire movie (oh wait, that's me).&amp;nbsp; It's those damn previews.&amp;nbsp;    I remember a day long ago when movie previews were no more than ten seconds long and had the most ambiguous trailers.&amp;nbsp; You'd be lucky if they even mentioned the title or leading actors in previews long ago.&amp;nbsp; But now, they basically spell out the plot, from begining to damn end in about five minutes.&amp;nbsp; Not only does it reveal the most action intense scenes, but they so heavily narrate the movie, you might as well download the trailer and be done with it.&amp;nbsp; here's an example of the way it used to be, compared to the way it is now using the Matrix.&amp;nbsp;    *you see the matrix code rush down the screen and then a five second shot of some white guy shooting somebody, face not exposed*    Narrator: On March 31st, you will experience action...

So there you have it, movie trailers now adays should be shot and thrown into an unquenchable fire.&amp;nbsp;      On the next episode of DragonBall Z...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Liberi Fatali... - 5/11/2004  I'd like to believe I've conducted my search as honostly and purely as I can.&amp;nbsp; I have not devoted myself to a lustful relationship, nor have I conspired a relationship merely out of a physical aspect.&amp;nbsp; I suppose I am too mature for my own good to say that all I want is that special girl i can hold in my arms, until the sun sets.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm just too damn desperate.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps I'm just kidding myself, entertaining even the smallest thought that Jackie may actually develop and realize what I mean to her, and her to me.&amp;nbsp; Jake was quick to insult, but his current girlfriend has not always made the most mature decisions, nor have any of us.&amp;nbsp; We are human and make mistakes.&amp;nbsp; I say this without insulting Jake, or raising my sword to defend Jackie.&amp;nbsp; Merely to put each in their place.&amp;nbsp;    I have a friend whom I once believed paralleled me on my search.&amp;nbsp; "i'm just looking for someone to share my love with".&amp;nbsp; If words could describe men, than that statement would suffice for him.&amp;nbsp; But nay, his words, though similar to my own, were not honost.&amp;nbsp; He looks not for a relationship as I do, but for a pretty face.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A puppy to look at and pet.&amp;nbsp; I on the other hand want a girl who I can look in the eyes of and just be happy to be with her, and her with me.&amp;nbsp; Someone who's hand always finds mine, and knows when I'm not in the best of spirits.&amp;nbsp;    My brother did not meet his fiance' until he was well into college. So it seem somewhat silly to be outraged by my constant misses.&amp;nbsp; Patience.&amp;nbsp; No longer will I pray for the deliverence of my beautiful dame, because I know she will come.&amp;nbsp; But I will and must pray that I can withold my integrity and honor so I can wait for her, and say with a truthful heart that I did in fact wait.&amp;nbsp; Dating is for dumping, as Matt, whom I love, has once and again said.&amp;nbsp; Farwell my friends, I must be off, for the trip is long, and I have wasted so much time waiting for it to come to me.&amp;nbsp;      I don't want to be alone anymore...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Dance of Curse... - 5/18/2004  I gave you my heart.&amp;nbsp; When that wasn't enough, I extended my hand.&amp;nbsp; Still you wanted more.&amp;nbsp; Well you had your two chances.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I for damn sure wont' be holding my heart in hand for you.&amp;nbsp; And don't expect me to be watiing at the bus stop for you, it's raining, and I gave you my umbrella too.&amp;nbsp; I was wrong to think you were mature enough to think you could reserve some room in your hollow heart for me.&amp;nbsp; Turns out there's only room for every guy on this cold rock but me.&amp;nbsp; This whole damn thing had to go sour.&amp;nbsp;    You're so full of contradiction.&amp;nbsp;    You assure me I have no reason to be jealous, but hook up with some guy you just met.&amp;nbsp;    You assure me I have no reason to be jealous, but I can't talk to anything with a fucking vagina without you getting mad.&amp;nbsp;    You tell me you do in fact have feelings for me, but fail to mention that doesnt make me special at all.&amp;nbsp;    You tell me you do in fact have feelings for me, but we're just friends.&amp;nbsp;    You say we're more than friends, but only friends.&amp;nbsp;    You say we're more than friends, but I guess Rob's just a friend too.&amp;nbsp;    "don't get mad at me for not knowing what to do about you Bryan", you cry.&amp;nbsp; That being the case, I've overstayed my welcome.&amp;nbsp; I had my fifteen minutes with you, now I yield your affection to the next guy in line.&amp;nbsp; I'm just glad the wait isn't too long.&amp;nbsp;    And don't you dare tell me that you miss me.&amp;nbsp; Don't dare say you'd die if I stopped talking to you, because you still draw breath.&amp;nbsp; And you dont' miss me enough to stay single.&amp;nbsp; Quite frankly, you don't have a damn clue what you want.&amp;nbsp; Don't give me a matter-a-factly when the only fact is that I dont matter.&amp;nbsp;    I did'nt 'give up'.&amp;nbsp; I gave in.&amp;nbsp; All my friends told me you were posion, I didn't believe them, I didn't believe you made me your 'yo-yo'.&amp;nbsp; I didn't want to admit to my parents it was over, because I didn't believe it.&amp;nbsp;    I made you promise you wouldn't drink so long as we were going out.&amp;nbsp; Let a promise keep you from what you want to do.&amp;nbsp; It's null and void, no more.&amp;nbsp; Drink your saddness away, you'll only be crying it back out.&amp;nbsp; Live your own life.&amp;nbsp; You didn't want just 'one man in your life'.&amp;nbsp; So find company with every cock bearing man in this world.&amp;nbsp; Every single one, everyone but me.&amp;nbsp;      And he continues his journey, Xylothin in hand...   &amp;nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Endless Waltz... - 5/19/2004  With each passing year, the excitement of a birthday, the anticipation, fades away.&amp;nbsp; Maybe my life is just becoming one big routine, eventually to be halted by the phenomenon called death.&amp;nbsp; The same holds true for Christmas.&amp;nbsp; Santa either died, or I'm just growing up.&amp;nbsp; I had a shitty birthday.&amp;nbsp;    Friday May 14th, 2004 2:30 PM CST:    After one of my final days of my shortlived junior year, I made my way to Target so I could switch schedules with Rand.&amp;nbsp; He apparently had some band thing on my birthday, so I got the opportunity to work for him.&amp;nbsp; "come in at 4:00 pm" they said.&amp;nbsp; (Well okay, that gives me enough time to sleep in and what not).&amp;nbsp; I leave, get home and dawn the suit I got for Christmas, I looked damn pimp.&amp;nbsp; Figured I should head over to the Hilton Hotel early and help set up the "Red Carpet Affair" because I failed to make this gay poster thing.&amp;nbsp; Got there around 4:30,&amp;nbsp;only person dressed up.&amp;nbsp; I helped put a few things together, not much else.&amp;nbsp;    RCA was basically a talent show/dance/awards ceremony.&amp;nbsp; Originally I had intended to take Jackie to this thing.&amp;nbsp; Well, I also originally had intended to go out with this women for more than a week.&amp;nbsp; Apparently I made up some bullshit lie like I was working that day so we couldnt go.&amp;nbsp; (she still wanted to go AFTER breaking up with me, how bout dem apples?).&amp;nbsp; Well I had a free ticket so Vanessa picked it up.&amp;nbsp; She rode with Chris.&amp;nbsp;    The whole deal was entertaining enough.&amp;nbsp; Everyone started dancing to rap, so I exited temporarily.&amp;nbsp; I sat down in a chair outside the reserved room and stared into the night sky.&amp;nbsp; it was about 8:30 or 9.&amp;nbsp; I got to have one of my all too infrequent moments of self contemplation.&amp;nbsp; They are always very calming.&amp;nbsp; It's basically just stepping out of your body and analyzing why you are the way you are.&amp;nbsp; What makes me tick.&amp;nbsp; I think I'm a good person.&amp;nbsp; i'd like to think I'm a work in progress, someone who wants to better himself.&amp;nbsp; I also came into that sense of doubt that's ever lingering in my mind.&amp;nbsp; I wish I was more charsimatic.&amp;nbsp; I have some big shoes to fill next year in PoP, but also some holes to fill in.&amp;nbsp; I suppose my main thought was trying to not be exclusive and hateful like our current senior regime is.&amp;nbsp; It's half trickled down to the juniors, but the sophmores are just great.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully I can extinguish that flame next year.&amp;nbsp;    RCA came to a close, and still feeling as though I had not contributed anything to it, offered to help take it down for Matt and the rest of the crew.&amp;nbsp; I did more manual labor that night than I ever intend to ever again.&amp;nbsp; I hauled more than 5X my weight, not saying that much, but still.&amp;nbsp; It was about midnight and I decided to help take everything from the Hilton hotel back to church.&amp;nbsp; By this time I was the only youth left, it was just Matt, Mr. Jones (AWESOME GUY) Mr. Carpenter (meh, he's an aggie) and me.&amp;nbsp; Just as we finished putting hte last few things in the youth room, I looked at my cell phone and said to myself "well crap, I'm 17 now".&amp;nbsp; No one noticed, no happy birthday.&amp;nbsp; I was a little upset.&amp;nbsp;    Saturday May 15th, 2003 12:20pm CST:&amp;nbsp;    I'm freaking tired,&amp;nbsp; my arms hurt, and I hear my phone vibrating.&amp;nbsp; Oh look, its my favorite place of employment, Target.&amp;nbsp; "yes, well, we need you to come in&amp;nbsp;around 1:00pm for more training".&amp;nbsp; Thanks for the heads up.&amp;nbsp; I make my way downstairs for breakfast, sulking and angry.&amp;nbsp; Mom didnt know I was going to work early until i was out the door.&amp;nbsp; No matter.&amp;nbsp; Greg had called and said he couldnt come down for my birthday since I was working.&amp;nbsp; I was a little upset.&amp;nbsp; When I got to work, Tiffane' had called to wish me a happy birthday.&amp;nbsp; "Well, I just called to say happy birthday, I'll bet you're having a lot of fun right now".&amp;nbsp; Ha, I laughed so hard when I heard her voicemail.&amp;nbsp; Nate and Chuck dropped by Target around 7 to give me my Bday present.&amp;nbsp; Then they fucked with my cart.&amp;nbsp; i was a little pissed off.&amp;nbsp; Chuck was squeezing his nipple.&amp;nbsp; that was gross, yet slightly humorous.&amp;nbsp; So i freaking worked, for 9 hours on my birthday.&amp;nbsp; And outside of my immediate family, 5 people remembered.&amp;nbsp; Damn horrible day.&amp;nbsp;    Well, as Jake once said, "A long enough timeline kills anything".&amp;nbsp; That seems very relevent, what me talking about aging and all.&amp;nbsp; meh, I guess you really only age if you are forgotten.&amp;nbsp;      Enough timeline can defeat all things, even life...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why get up... - 5/26/2004    Why keep fighting?   For a long time now I have tried to become a chasteful and moral individual.&amp;nbsp; I have done my best to abstain from lust, drinking and other temptations which I know to be wrong.&amp;nbsp; What good has this noble sacrifice gotten me?&amp;nbsp; 'It's really attractive to have stayed a virgin this long, Bryan' Jayci tells me.&amp;nbsp; Wow, look how many unnattractive people there are in this world then.&amp;nbsp; And look at how few there will be when I tie the knot.&amp;nbsp; "Don't you ever just want to go out and have fun.&amp;nbsp; Lose control?"    Yes.&amp;nbsp; At times my morale and resolve is low.&amp;nbsp; At times I want to shed my ethics and simply 'live for the moment'.&amp;nbsp; But nay, I refuse to believe that doing something so selfish is worthwhile.&amp;nbsp; Yet, in a world where that is but the norm, what good is it?&amp;nbsp; I ask for justification of my own actions.&amp;nbsp; Someone explain to me why I dont go out and have fun like the rest.&amp;nbsp; Why do I not do these things when I am not a role model.&amp;nbsp; When my actions are not regarded highly in any form or fashion.&amp;nbsp; Why carry this cross, that so many others have abandoned?&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm wrong.&amp;nbsp; Maybe going out, becoming intoxicated and making out with some person you just met is holy and moral.&amp;nbsp;    Maybe everything I've ever lived my life for is but a deception.&amp;nbsp; Maybe Love is just some insipid invention.&amp;nbsp; Some febel construct of a weak human intelect.&amp;nbsp;    But maybe I'm right.&amp;nbsp; I just want to know why I am, and what worth it is to be right.&amp;nbsp; What good is a Paladin when his castle crumbles around him?&amp;nbsp; What good is an ethical person when ethics cease to be?      Do you believe you're fighting for something...   &nbsp;  Waltz for Venus... - 5/26/2004  I sit here at my computer gazing at His Dark Materials.&amp;nbsp; A Trilogy I recently purchased at the inspiration of my friends Jake and Nathan.&amp;nbsp; I can recall, last year Jake having just finished reading it, explaining what a great trilogy it is, how it has a fantastic love story.&amp;nbsp; Once more I gaze at the books, and above the title it clearly displays the books' genre.&amp;nbsp; 'Fantasy'.    It's all, just a dream.&amp;nbsp;    Love, that ever elusive Unicorn.&amp;nbsp; Just over the horizon.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it is just a fantasy.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps this journey has been nothing more than an Odyssey without an Ithaka.&amp;nbsp; So I sit here, staring blankly at my computer screen, words appearing at my very will.&amp;nbsp; Only words.&amp;nbsp;    Not everyone gets married.&amp;nbsp; Not everyone finds love.&amp;nbsp; Few I suppose do.&amp;nbsp; How lucky they must be, do they even realize it?&amp;nbsp;    Again I see people who are constantly in a relationship, rarely with the same person.&amp;nbsp; Does that mean anything?&amp;nbsp; Is that love, does that make them happy?&amp;nbsp; It wouldn't make me happy, that much is true.&amp;nbsp; Sure, the void would be filled, but with each passing girlfriend.&amp;nbsp; With each passing love, that void would only swell.      See you space cowboy...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Today at work (Nesbits today), I realized just how much I hate my last name.  Honeycutt.  It's hard not to make fun of that name.  My friends all have cool names.  Cooper, Thompson, Hartman, etc.  The only insult for cooper is poopers cooper, which was uttered by Alice McDonald, only because everything she says needs to be accompanied by one.  Because all she says is s**t basically.   So this big black lady goes, 'hey bryan... uh, honeycomb?  Uh, honeysomething?'.  I hate myself.  And i'm putting up all these clothes that belong to people with freaking awesome last names.  I'd give an arm and a leg to have names like some people have: Valore, Machines, Terranova.  Freaking awesome names.     I am forced to live in perpetual angst and self hate...
