       Greetings!  I’m looking forward to meeting all of you on Tuesday, June 1 for our first night of class.  I wanted to advise you of two announcements before starting, to make they do not catch you by surprise:  1) Please make sure that you have the Grabe & Grabe text with the additional “Window to the World” chapter at the end of the book. This is a required section for a writing assignment. In the past, National has indiscriminately ordered the edition without this chapter for EDT 608 students.   2) You may already be aware that this course was originally scheduled as a M/W course. For this reason, I arranged a Wednesday night field trip for us to KOCE-TV on June 16 (a Wednesday) from 6-9pm for a presentation with Hall Davidson, Director of Educational Services. I may not be able to reschedule this presentation with such short notice. Please respond via email as soon as you receive this email if making it to this field trip on a Wednesday night (in place of the June 17th regular course meeting) would present a hardship for you.     I’m excited to begin working with you as we discover resources, tools and skills to enhance teaching and learning with technology together.  See you Tuesday!

       A few of you have approached me about other extra-credit activities.   Because I'm a softie at heart, I will relent.   While not officially sanctioned by NU, I will allow those of you who answer  all three  short essay questions instead of 2 of the 3 to be eligible for an additional 3 points (that's the equivalent of an additional 30% on the Final Exam - quite generous, I think!). Depending on the quality of the answer, you could get 0, 1, 2 or 3 points in bonus.  Here are the rules: 1) You CANNOT work on this during the presentations tomorrow. 2) You must have this turned in to me via email (no hard copies in my box) by noon Tuesday, June 29.  3) If you are an insomniac and somehow succeed in completing this before 8am tomorrow, you may give me a hard copy then. 4) If you resort to any sort of plagiarism in this short essay, I will give you a zero for  all three  short essay questions.  No questions asked.  No room for argument. 5) Please identify this as EXTRA CREDIT in the subject line of the email for easy identification. 6) Circle your initials on the sign-in sheet tomorrow to let me know tomorrow that you will be attempting this.   Good luck.  Three points can make the difference between a B+ and an A-.  Mike
