      its neetz bday... and im so glad that i didnt f4get about it, I wudn't have EVER 4given myself if i'd 4gotten about how important this day is to Neetu... had rang her up at 12:30am IST, but 3re was no sign of them alive... so i left a message [SMS], 'Happy Birthday Neet! guess you slept, i'll call you 2mmorow'.  so like i promised, i rang her up in the morning 6:30am my time and wished her, the girl hasn't changed a bit, the very same hyper ol' neet i remember of!.. it was nice talkin to her after a very long time.... She was tellin me about the one week at college, ragging and stuff she is all pissed wid college already... heh heh!  One of those long gone feelings... reviving back into you! its beautiful!   i guess people should be apart more often, its only then you value the importance of their presence... but no i don't take people for granted...

      Mom's dad passed off the other day.. Friday, early in the morning 1:30am IST. Not that i am sentimental over it, but hey! is 3re actually a need to flash the news about the death? i mean they are frantically ringing up everyone abt the Man's demise, apart 4rm ringing even publishing the fact in the News Paper.... i swear, the whole 'Rest in Peace' concept is to pieces when this is the deed behind life..   Death is inevitable for all and each 1 of us are heading for it, so its prety obvious that one of us is about 'Kick the Bucket' sooner or later, no matter how important that person is to you or not.....   i still don't get the need 4 the media hype...

      I discovered this remarkable ‘Record of thoughts’ - journel, a couple of months back, was never motivated to start one at that state of time but now the rate at which there is a ‘barge in’ of thoughts, events and clash of ego I guess its high time I loosin up and let myself known to atleast a bunch of you readers caz this saturation at which I’ve placed myself has astonishingly made me insane…  Thanks a zillion Avi!.
