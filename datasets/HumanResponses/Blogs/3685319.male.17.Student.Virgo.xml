       MOOD:  TIRED ;| MUISC:  AFI - DAYS OF THE PHOENIX   What's up people?!  Well, today was a very VERY long day!  It was my first day back at work and they seemed to have a feild day at giving me a hard time with things.  It wasn't cool!  I mean all damn day they had joy in giving me a hard time.  It's just not a cool thing at all!  I hope that tommarow will be a better day.  It's only a matter of time before things are going to get better.    "Everything has a begining has an end."  Last night we had a rain storm that was REALLY bad.  I mean it flooded streets that in my entire life, I have never seen flood in El Paso.  It was really bad.    "If for only one minute can one be lost in a single drop of rain."  On the other side of things, Paul has yet to pay me.  That's not a good thing!  I need that money.  I could of spent the time at work, yet, I took the week off to rest.  IT SUCKS!!  The first of the month is coming and I have two dollars to my name.  That's not cool at all.  I just have a lot of shit on my mind.  I need to vent!    I spend the time to write becuase I find some kind of reasoning to what I say.  It's kind of a hard thing to understand but it works for me.  I think it's because I actually have a chance to sit back and look at my life from a different point of view.  well, today, I went to Comp USA with Maria and looked at a few things that we might want for the APT, but we have no money to buy them.  We can still dream right?    Anyways, my plans for my Monte are slowly coming along.  I think it might take a year or two, but I still want my dream.  She's going to run a eight!  I know it!  On the other hand, the Civic that I just bought, is a long way off from being paid for.  Yet, I still don't have any rights to the damn car.  That pisses me off too.  I can't touch the damn thing.  I can't put my 500 dollar system in it, an alarm..., nothing and yet I'm paying for it!  Can you beleave that?  I'm really tired right now ...  I need to get some rest, but I can't find the time or even the energy to rest.  It's a sad fact that you need energy to rest.  Well, with me that's how it is.    Anyways, I'll chat with you guys later ...  John      apt06.29.04_09-00pm

      Well, let me tell ya ..  today was a pretty cool day.  It started off with the normal "what-are-we-going-to-eat-dicusion," but all in all it was pretty cool.  We went out to the local resturant called, The Clock.  It's one of my favorite places to eat.  You can get mostly anything you would want to eat in the morning.  ;)  After that we came home and showered and played some video games. (lol)  What else do you do on a Saturday, right?!  After that we decied to go see a movie (Harry Potter).  It started at 5:00pm, so we didn't get out of the movies till about 8:300pm.  Anyways, I want to post some pics ...  hope you enjoy them!    This is the way the aptartment looks right now ...  (10:25pm)    My Girl Friend, Maria ...  She's Fuckin Awesome!  Welp, I chat with ya tommarow ...  buh bye

      Well, I guess this is kind of a joke, but my previous post stated that I had just went to see a movie, right?  Well, I went to go see the new Harry Potter movie.  It's a really interesting movie.  I really think that the Harry Potter series is not only for children, but also for an adult crowd, as well.  It's a really cool movie!    I give it a 4 1/2 stars out of 5.   Go see it!  It's worth the money!

      Well, today we went to the movies.  It's was pretty cool.  I really miss the fact that I can't seem to take my girlfriend out on a date.  I mean, we're either doing something or with friends.  It's starting to get to me.

The good news is that I'm now teaching the CNA class at my mother's school.&nbsp; I have to get up at 4:00AM, but still I really do enjoy teaching.&nbsp; There's always something that can be taugh between student and teacher.&nbsp; It's just a weird wacked thing that I've learned.  Some of the bad news, is that Maria can't work up at the school anymore.&nbsp; That sucks!&nbsp; I'm really not going into detail with that, but ...&nbsp; it just sucks big donkey dick!  Right now, I waiting for Maria to come home.&nbsp; She went with her mother to go out to eat and to see a movie.&nbsp; It's cool how she can still have mother and daughter time after what had happend.&nbsp; I still feel a little weird about her mother ...&nbsp; It's a long story ...&nbsp; I might explain later ...

      Well, i've have alot of things ahead of me this month.  My brother and mother, which are both my bosses, are leaving on a trip.  It's not cool!  I mean, they get to go have fun and I have to stay at work!  Well, I guess it's not that bad.  I am getting paid more this month.  I'm working my ass off for it, but still ...  It's worth it!  Well, a few night's back I saw The Village.  It was a pretty interesting movie.  I recommend it to anyone who really feels like the world needs a change.  It has one hell of twist for an ending.  Go check it out!  As for things back at home ...  not so good!  Maria's grandfather passed away this morning.  I just hope I can support her as much as I can.  My heart goes out for your grandfather!
