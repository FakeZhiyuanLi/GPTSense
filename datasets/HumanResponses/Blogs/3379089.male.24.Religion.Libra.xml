						   I had to go to the doctor this morning to get my blood taken, for cholesterol.  My mother suggested that I get a check-up before I get married.  When the nurse knew I was about to get married, she told me that her husband would call me "another sucker."  Another man, much older, once told me that "Marriage is where friendship ends and hell begins."  Thanks for the encouragement!  They make it sound like you have to play for the LA Clippers the rest of your life.  Here is a quote from another blooger on http://www.thesearching.blogspot.com.  Entry April 1st.  "True confession of the need for Christ--true recognition of his identity--is not an action. I think it is a reaction; I think it is fruit of something much deeper. The life of Christ offers much more than language could ever encapsulate or misconstrue."  He has some really keen insights, so check him out.  He has a point about the life of Christ offers much more than language could ever encapsulate.  The  information  we have about the Bible and Jesus is not  just  facts, although some would argue.  It needs to be in ward -formation.  Reading the stories of God should transform the way in which we life, see, think and breathe.  Hope then becomes not just an answer, but the fabric of our journeys.  Oh by the way, I'm still trying to let my life be transformed and not be an answer-man.

						   I've already been up for almost 4 hours now and still, everyone in my house is sleeping.  WAKE UP!  I had to go to the dentist today and get whats called a "flipper."  This device is a retainer with one tooth on it.  For those of you who don't know me, I am in the process of having a tooth implant on my front right tooth.  With this "flipper" I can take it out any time I want to and freak the mess out of some folks.  Let's just pray it stays in during the wedding and honeymoon.  Might have to buy some of that miracle Fixadent cream: "Just Fixadent and forget it."  If you all have time, click on the website below:  www.thehungersite.com  You can click a button that supposedly feeds people in starving areas of the world.  Let's be a blessing to others.  Live joyfully today friends.

						   Hi.  I'm Clark and I'm a blogger.  Yikes!  To know all the implications of that is scary, I guess.  So after much deliberation and thinking, actually I just had to defeat the laziness plague, I am adding my thoughts and ideas to the blogger community that resides in the time space continuum.  I hope I can stick with this, but I make no promises.  Anywho, thanks and enjoy.  Oh, about the title of my page...it has been taken from a song....who sings it and what song is it?

						   If you haven't noticed, I changed my title page's name to "No Alarms and No Suprises, Please."  Radiohead sings this song on their   OK Computer   album.  I like this song because it accsensuates their entire album by concerning itself with a busy and comfortable human heart that is full of waste as a landfill and is happy to settle for the quiet life, the poisonous fumes and a life of   no alarms and no surprises please.    It seems that at the end of the day a pretty house and a pretty garden and no suprises are the desires of the day.  It is almost as if we are handed a sentence unaware, then hating the stale walls of our prison, and finally getting used to them as the only way it can be.  As Red, Andy Dufrain's cell-mate in the movie   Shawshank Redemption   said, "At first you hate these walls, then you accept them, and eventually you become dependent on them."    I pray that we don't allow life to trap us into its monotonous haze.  That we don't ask for any alarms or suprises.  Let us not make our life, our country a hotel civilization obsessed with comfort and convenience and contentment.

						   I'm watching Good Morning America and they had a segment about girls getting breast augmentation for their high school graduation.  The main debate was over self-esteem and that for women, their breast size is how they value themselves.  Has our society been so foolish to think that our identity is on magazine covers and music videos?  Actually...Yes.  I can't think that if one gets surgery, is that an automatic self-esteem booster.  I mean, isn't our esteem a lot deeper than our body parts?  I must be honest, it is easy to get caught up in the idea of shaping my image to what is viewed as "in" or "popular."  And we know that in every human is a need to be accepted.  So as the great thinker Henri Nouwen questioned: "Could you live with only God's acceptance in this world?  Is God's love enough to you?"  Detriot Pistons, well done.

						   So last night, Jenn and I started our weekly menu for dinner.  We sat down and came up with a meal for each night of the week.  After that we went shopping for the right ingredients.  Well last night we were going to have this Chicken Veggie-Casserole.  I decided I was going to cook it while Jenn was going to write thank you notes for the wedding gifts.  I just have to say, this casserole was going to be off the chain.  I spent an hour chopping, slicing, cutting, cooking, and mixing.  We finished preparing and placed it in the oven in one of those PYREX dishware containers.  While we waited I started cleaning the dishes.  About five minutes later we heard a loud sound coming from the oven.  It was the PYREX.  It had exploded and all our casserole was on the bottom of the oven.  Needless to say, we were saddened.  So we went to CrackerBarrel because we had a gift card there.  The moral of this story is Proverbs 15:17  "Better is a dinner of vegetables where love is, than a fatted ox and hatred with it."  Well put Solomon.  It seems the Supreme Court ruled the "under God" to remain in the Pledge.  But it couldn't rule if it was separating church and state because the man who was defending his 10 year old daughter was only his step-daughter, or something.  Do you guys really care these days?  I mean, yes our country was an escape land that people fled to to get away from the Catholic church (exaggeration of course), and yes many churches were established with the mentality of "well if I don't like your church, I can start my own" (a theme that is arising in our day as well).  And yes I am glad that we are free nation, but we are hardly "one nation under God."  More like "one nation under capitalism or materialism."  Sorry to rant and rave about this but I'm just having a hard time with America and God that association.  Especially when you go to church and they sing "America" or "God Bless America" or when they have the American flag in the building.  Why are we so set on not having any symbols or signs that represent our faith because we are afraid of it being Orthodox or Catholic, but we can have symbols and signs that represent our corrupt and wealthy nation.  Don't get me wrong, I love our troops and pray for them and our government, but I also am challenged to love the Iraq community and pray for them as well.  And so who really is our enemy?  Is it Bin-Laden's crew?  Is it Congress?  Is it the athletes who whine about not getting 20 million a year while children in Africa starve to death?  Is it the American dream?  Your thoughts?

						   Hello again friends.  Sorry for the wait.  I have been busy, you know the regular getting married, moving out, honeymoon, etc.    If you haven't seen The Royal Tenenbaums, rent it this week.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Jenn and I watched it Saturday night and I just love the story and the soundtrack to this film.  Wes Anderson is a cinematic genius in my opinion.  It is a wonderful story of a broken and failed family and the redemption they see from their father's last attempt to save the Tenenbaums.  OK, so yes this movie is rated R, but I don't hold myself to just non-R rated movies.  We can learn a lot from this storytellers in our world today.  Anyway, it depicts a beautiful tale of betrayal, bitterness, and failure that is resurrected in the end by Royal's heroic effort.    Also, I read the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.  Great story.  It moved well and the suspense is riveting.  It flows in an excellent manner while still informing the reader of important facts and lessons.  I don't believe the story, but it is good entertainment.

						   "No one is more foolish than one who forces the meaning of the Scriptures or finds fault with them so as to demonstrate his own knowledge - or, rather, his own ignorance.  What kind of knowledge can result from adapting the meaning of the Scriptures to suit one's own likes and from daring to alter their words?  The true sage is one who regards the text as authoritative and discovers, through the wisdom of the Spirit, the hidden mysteries to which the divine Scriptures bear witness."  - Peter of Damaskos

						   I haven't read any of Brennan Manning's books, but he has a book that is out in July called The Wisdom of Tenderness, How God's   Fierce Mercy   will transform you.  I don't know about you, but I'm not sure I really understand mercy.  I mean, yeah, I know the word and what it means, but I don't grasp and live in mercy.  As I was driving to work this morning, I thought about God's forgiveness and how I just keep it to a prayer for "I'm sorry God.  I'll never do this again."  But is that what God wants us to get out of forgiveness?  And what about that wording "fierce mercy?"  Meditate on mercy and enlighten me friends.

						   "The spiritual life begins with the acceptance of our wounded self.  Whatever is denied cannot be healed."                              - Brennan Manning  Wrap that around your minds for a minute.  On another heavy note, my good friend and mentor Mike Stroud is leaving MTSU and headed out to the beautiful land of Beavers and Ducks (Oregon).  He has spent 20 years in campus ministry, most at MTSU and has been a delight to that program.  He portrays a selflessness that is rare among men and a passion that ignites those around him.  So Mike, we salute you and your work here.  May God bring numerous blessing to your family and your work in Oregon.  Learn to fly-fish while your there.  Aint nothing like grilled Halibut.

						   Well I started my new job at Cokesbury Publishing.  Today was super slow.  My trainee partner Joan, never showed up today so they had me doing "busy work" all day.  I should have asked to do a word search or something.  The people that work in that area are very nice so that is cool but I have to drive an hour to work each day. Yuck.   Last night, my wife and I started to read Nehemiah together.  I enjoy O.T. stories of faithful men and women.  Nehemiah just has a great heart, first to pray in intervention for his people and their sin.  The hard thing is, he prayed not for them, but for "us."  I find it really hard to look at my own sin when I know of others that are drowning in it.  Humility.  Something I'm learning about.  Oh yeah, read Wild at Heart, even if you are a women.  Awesome stuff.

						   Could resting be seen as a spiritual discipline?  My co-worker at work was raised Seventh Day Adventist and she was telling me about their Sabbath (Friday sun down to Saturday sun down).  Not only did they go to church on Saturday morning, they rested from beginning to end.  And when they weren't at church they were hanging out with the family feasting on God's word.  [Interesting how the Hebrews began their day at sundown.  It would be a good reminder to us working folk to view our day like that so we can start fresh when we return home from work and see our family.]  It made me think about how much time I just "hang out with God."  Am I resting in His presence?  So friends, are we serious about resting with God?  Or do we serve the idol of busyness?  Moreover, do we use the busyness to please God?  "Look God, I'm involved.  I go to Bible study four nights a week and church on Sunday morning, night and Wednesday night."  Activities, Activities, Activities.  Now I'm not talking about slothfulness or laziness, but soaking up the grace of our King by just being there with Him.  Making scared space in our souls for Him to enter and commune with us.  So for the holiday weekend, enjoy friends and family.  Let us rest and enjoy life and the beautiful creation that surrounds us.  May we rest and breathe deep God's blessings.

						   Here's a thought:  How much of the Christian doctrine is based on   death  , especially   Christ's death  ?  My guess would be, ALOT.  My belief says that Jesus died, whether on Good Friday or not.  While this is important to my belief structure, this is only half the picture.  If Jesus was still in the ground, my faith is all well and good, but there is no hope after I die, no goal in this life to strive for, not just heaven but to make an eternal difference in my world.  So as a Christian, I belief that he rose from death, to defeat the boundaries of the grave and the unseen forces of evil.  So why aren't we focusing on Jesus' victory more?  Like communion.  We can meditate on Christ's death all 8 minutes of the Lord's Supper, and sure we can reflect on how crappy we are, how we sinned that past week and how guilty we feel for placing him on Calvary, BUT shouldn't we also see the signficants of his rising?  (A parallel thought: did we place Jesus up there or God?)  This should be celebrated in baptism too. A celebration when one decides to die (sad) to self but be raised (happy) anew.  Maybe this is why so many of our brothers and sisters are living without vigor or excellence.  We've pounded a theology of "death" in our heads that we don't have any push to live an excellent life, abundant and fully alive.  Is this spiritual suicide to anyone else?

						   Here are some wise words from Agur.  Pray them today, and everyday.    Two things I ask of you; do not deny them to me before I die. Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that I need.  -Proverbs 30:7-8  I finished the book of Proverbs and realized how much Solomon talks about helping out the needy and poor.  Isn't that worship too?  We can feel great about a great devo and the singing, and the great preaching or teaching from a Sunday morning.  But what are we doing to worship our Maker outside the church?  Since working with Cokesbury, a United Methodist Publishing House, I can tell they are very sincere about serving the needy communities.  And that my friends is a godly characteristic.  So why aren't we doing it?  "Well, Clark, we go on mission trips to help those under privileged."  Thats great.  But aren't we substituting the real people we serve for our own agenda?  Aren't we using them to get our "spiritual highs and our "God-feelings" back?  We don't say it like that, but its true.  "They" are our spiritual projects to show us how fortunate we are and how blessed we are and how I will never be the same again when I go back home.  3 weeks later, back to the same lifestyle.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for overseas mission trips and short term "campaigns," but serving others, especially the poor must be a way of mind.  Thoughts?

						   It's almost been a year since I've read "A New Kind of Christian."  And it still has shaken my soul with the pondering thoughts Brian McLaren has addressed.  Because of his creative writing, it has made me really think about salvation, along with other important conversations.  Is salvation something we "get" and then consider the option of joining God in His grand mission?  Or is salvation something we experience while joining God in His grand mission?  Is the real issue being "saved" or "crossing a line" or signing on to a new set of beliefs?  Or is it following Jesus, joining him in his adventure and mission of saving the world and expressing God's love.  If a person isn't moving ahead on that journey, then no matter how many aisle he walks down and cards he fills out and "sinner's prayer" he says, is that person in any meaningful way experiencing salvation?  Is it any of our business who goes to hell?

						   Way to go Coach K for staying with Duke.  I don't care if you like him or hate him (most of you probably hate Duke) but he loves the game of college ball too much to give it up for Hollywood and the thugs that play in the NBA.  While I applaud him, I am sadden by the loss of Steve Nash to Phoenix.  Cuban, what are you thinking?  Get rid of Walker.  He's fat, slow and jacks up the threes.  Oh the sorrow in Mav-land.  At least we got Dirk.  I'm off to Pensacola for an interview this weekend.  Pray for my wife and I as we travel and meet the family at Gateway.

						   I had to pick up a tux yesterday for a wedding I'm in this weekend Robert Gill and Emily Clifford.&nbsp; When I was trying on my tux, I couldn't believe that I had been in there myself almost a month and half ago for my own wedding.&nbsp; Life sure goes fast.&nbsp; Jennifer and I still wait for a call from the Gateway church to see what their decision will be.&nbsp; We also got a call from a church in West Arkansas about campus work.&nbsp; It's hard to know where to go but we know to let God work out the details.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The command "Be ye perfect" is not idealistic gas.&nbsp; Nor is it a command to do the impossible.&nbsp; He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that command.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - C.S.

						   Dallas Willard states that God has   pity   on us.  He remembers what we are made of and remembers that we are dust.  He says this during his chapter on the Lord's Prayer (section on 'Don't Punish Us for Things We Do Wrong:'    "The word   pity   makes us wince, as   mercy   does not.  Our current language has robbed   mercy   of its deep traditional meaning, which is practically the same as   pity  .  To pity someone now is to feel sorry for them, and that is regatded as demeaning, wheras to have mercy now is thought to be slightly noble - just 'give em a break.'  It is pure egotism to say 'I'm not a sinner, I just need a break.'  No, I need more than a break.  I need pity because of who I am.  If my pride is untouched when I pray for forgiveness, I have not prayed for forgiveness.  I don't even understand it."

						   Since the Wilco record came out, that's all I've been listening to.  Yesterday, I finally took it out and put in some good ol' Rich Mullins.  How much more great and inspired music this man would have made if he was still alive.  I really enjoy his sincerity in his lyrics and his voice.  Andrew Peterson is another guy who I think resembles Rich in ways.  Andrew's lyrics dive deep into the heart of a man's soul and paint pictures that are incredibly vivid.  On the "secular" side (dern titles), I still can't abandon Jeff Tweedy of Wilco.  Sure I'm a huge fan and have been since the Uncle Tupelo days, but he writes with such emotion.  Especially in this new album where he seeks an identity (I'm an echo, I'm a wheel, I'm an ocean, etc.).  Check out these and other great artist by supporting your local record store.

						   On my way to work, I listen to these guys named Rick and Bubba.  I gave up listening to preaching cause it would either make me mad or it was too early in the morning to be thinking deeply.  They were talking about making paper airplanes in school.  Well, I was a horrible airplane maker back in the day.  I couldn't compete with the aviators of my day.  Alas, my day arrived about two years ago when I was working at an extended care program at a local school.  We couldn't go outside because it was raining so we had lots of scrap paper laying around for the kids to draw and color on.  Then one kid came up to me and asked me to help him make an airplane.  "This is my time to shine," I thought. "Redemption."  Soon enough all the kids were begging me to make these jets of paper.  Then I even went as far as making a stunt plane.  After that day I retired from this craft never to pick it up again.    How was your paper airplane skills?

						   During my interview this weekend, I was asked a great question, that I ask you all.  What is the hardest lesson you've learned through your greatest trial?  My answer was about how I learned to accept God's mystery in my life.  My brother-in-law died during his and my sister's 4th year of marriage (no kids).  Mark and Shelley were helping some friends from church move, when Mark had a massive heart attack.  My sister was right by his side.  He was 26, healthy and loved to serve others in the spirit of Jesus.  This was about 4 years ago.  I still have no idea why this had to happen.  I guess I never will.  And that's o.k.  God is mysterious.  The way He works and moves and lives with us is, personally, odd to me.  Not the way I'd do things, but good thing I'm not the Potter.

						     I thought this was hilarious.&nbsp; I was never a big fan of Shaq Diesel (maybe cause I cannot stand the Lakers).&nbsp; But he is one funny guy.&nbsp; He had his first press conference in Miami since being signed to the Heat yesterday.&nbsp; Here are some quotes from the press conference.   I just bought a house on the beach, and my wife loves for me to walk on the beach naked.&nbsp; So if take pictures of me naked walking on the beach, you have to give me 15% of what you sell to the Inquirer.    Pat Riley told me to do one thing when I came here, and that is to take care of business.&nbsp; And that is what I'm going to do.&nbsp; To take care of business...period.&nbsp;   P-U-R-E-U-D.&nbsp; Period.

						   What if saving the church is a self-defeating mission?&nbsp; Is the church preoccupied with her own existance?&nbsp; Will the church have to rethink far more than just their cosmetics?&nbsp; These are some questions posed by Brian McLaren in Leadership Magazine.&nbsp; Check it out:    urlLink http://www.christianitytoday.com/leaders/newsletter/2004/cln40629.html     We would intend to make disciples and let converts "happen" rather than intending to make converts and letting disciples "happen."&nbsp; One cannot build discipleship to Jesus by doding serious issues or not doing jsutice to honest doubts about him and his teachings.&nbsp; If we cannot break through to a new vision of faith and discipleship, the real significance and power of the gospel of the kingdom of God can never come into its own. &nbsp;      Dallas Willard, "Divine Conspiracy"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						     There is a widespread notion that just pasisng through death transforms human character.&nbsp; Discipleship is not needed.&nbsp; Just believe enough to "make it."&nbsp; What if death only forever fixes us as the kind of person we are at death?&nbsp; What would one  do  in heaven with a debauched character or a hate-filled heart?&nbsp; I often wonder how happy and useful some of the fearful, bitter, lust-ridden, hate-filled Christian I have seen involved in church or family or neighborhood or political battles would be if they were forced to live forever in the unrestrained fullness of the reality of God and with multitudes of beings really like him.  &nbsp; Dallas Willard "The Divine Conspiracy"    &nbsp;

						   It's early.&nbsp; Every time I wake up, I think, "Surely 5:50 is too early to be getting out of bed."&nbsp; But I must arrive to work on time.&nbsp; Somedays I wish for public transit from the Boro to Nashville.&nbsp; Other days I enjoy being by myself in the car, not talking to anyone.&nbsp;   Last night, I met up with two of my good friends.&nbsp; We had a great time of sharing, laughing, praying, listening.&nbsp; I really enjoy their companionship and company.&nbsp; And then Tuesday night, my wife and I had one of my close friends over to eat with us.&nbsp; She cooked all the meal and him and I cleaned up afterwards.&nbsp; And this past Sunday night at a reception for Mike Stroud, several of the people I knew in college were back to celebrate and remember the good times.&nbsp; It's funny because I used to be so fired up about leaving the Boro and doing my own thing, but now if my wife and I have to leave, I'll be sad to say the least.&nbsp; It has made me be thankful for friends, especially those that&nbsp;I have a special connection with.&nbsp; Former roommates, old Bible study group members, the guys in "Safety Dance," flag football teammates.&nbsp; I have been blessed to have some awesome men in my life that have encouraged me, supported me, prayed with me, strengthened me, and loved me for who I am.&nbsp; Nothing more, nothing less.&nbsp; I hope that wherever we end up, doing whatever it is, I pray that we can continue to be this support and encouragement to each other, as well as create new relationships and dear friends.&nbsp; So to all of you who have been an influence, a friend, an amigo, a guide, a voice....thanks.

						   We refer to the Bible as a member of our community of faith - an essential member that must be listened to on all matters on which it speaks.&nbsp; This approach is meant to strengthen rather than diminish the Bible's authority.&nbsp; When we read the Bible in our community, we attempt to fully engage ourselves in it and in the God who inspired its creation.&nbsp; We work to listen to the community of faith that has produced us and the God who dwells in us.&nbsp; We focus our efforts on trying to figure out if our lives could be relevant to the story of God, not if the Bible can be relevant to our lives.&nbsp; We can only do this when we allow the information gleaned from the stories of the Bible to couple with our experiences, hopes, and ideas.&nbsp; Our trust in the Bible does not depend on information that "proves" the Bible to be credible.&nbsp; We believe the Bible because our hopes, ideas, experiences, and community of faith allow and require us to believe.

						   "Christianity is not a religion, but a relationship."&nbsp; I'm sure&nbsp;most of you have heard this statement, especially if you&nbsp;share the Christian faith.&nbsp; This tidy definition helped make faith more than a meaningless ritual.&nbsp; For some, it created an avenue out of the cold halls of legalism and "rule keeping."&nbsp; While I still believe in the "relational"&nbsp;aspects of my walk with God, I wonder if my faith had any public usefulness to others.&nbsp; We are taught to make time with God, one-on-one, to be very self-indulgent in the way we treat our faith.&nbsp; But how useful is my life in bringing about the things of the Kingdom of God?&nbsp; What does it mean to live a life, to have a faith that is good to the entire world?&nbsp; Why do I follow Jesus?&nbsp; Is it because I can punch my "reservation" ticket to the eternal banquet?&nbsp; Is it because I have someone (God)&nbsp;who watches out for my safety, and when I do find myself in a bind, that someone (God) will help me and deliver me from that peril?&nbsp;   Do you see the issue here?&nbsp; Our faith can become so "me" oriented.&nbsp; What's the use to the world if our faith is such that it only will apply to "me"?&nbsp; I hope I can become someone who is can see past my concern with my own salvation and practice  useful  faith in our context and our world.

						   My head has been wading through some deep foggy area lately.&nbsp; The more and more I read and ask God for guidance, it seems as though I'm finding myself with more questions than answers.&nbsp; Maybe this is my modern mindset being "deconstructed" by postmodern philosophy, only to "emerge" as a "reconstructed" belief system.&nbsp;   So let's begin shall we.&nbsp; I have a lot of down time at work, so I read lots of other blogs as well as sites such as theOooze.com, ginkworld, emergentvillage, etc.&nbsp; These sites and blogs have really been a blessing for me because they make me think.&nbsp; I am so excited to see people engage in conversation about our world, our faith, our theology.&nbsp; Maybe I should sit down and write out what I believe and why.&nbsp; I love to read as well.&nbsp; I'm on Doug Pagitt's (Solomon's Porch) book  Reimagining Spiritual Formation .&nbsp; His theology is very stirring because it matches that of his church.&nbsp; He and the community there in Minnesota are being intention about being a community that strives to live out their theology.&nbsp; Here is a great quote from the book:    We are called to live in awareness of the legacy we leave for those who come after us.    Amen!&nbsp; The thing about Doug is, he will tell you "Don't copy us, because what we do is not a model of what you need to do."&nbsp; His point is that his book does not provide a quick solution to community in 10 easy to read chapters.&nbsp; No, God is doing something very different in the SP community, just like He is doing in Jacob's Well in Kansas.&nbsp; We should be very wary of not following the current trends or whats cool or hip.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; We should ask, "What context are we in and how is God using our context to call us into authenticity."&nbsp; Church along with Christianity is not some product to be marketed, sold and consumed.&nbsp; Questions like "So who are we targeting? What demographic market are you going after?"&nbsp; These questions should make us quiver with disgust.&nbsp; Unfortunately much more energy has gone into discovering the best use of marketing techniques for the church than reflecting on what happens to the gospel when it becomes a product of an ever-desiring culture looking for "value-added" faith as the final rung of the self-actualization ladder.&nbsp;   All that to say that I have no idea what I would do if I ever find a place that will accept my weakness and foolishness to work in ministry.&nbsp; First thought is to use all of these "cool" "hip" "artistic" avenues to draw people in to your community.&nbsp; And yes, I am all about seeing people come face-to-face with the Creator in worship, but just because I have stations, or follow the Christian calendar, or have couches with abstract painting on the wall, that doesn't mean that community is going to happen.&nbsp; Like Abraham in Genesis 12, God  will show us the land .&nbsp; He didn't show Abraham before he left Ur.&nbsp;&nbsp;God just said, "Ggo, take the journey.&nbsp; You'll have questions and battles but if you didn't you wouldn't trust me.&nbsp; I WILL show you, just not yet."&nbsp; So as it is with us, moving into&nbsp;a journey that holds much at stake but the outcome is uncertain.&nbsp; We really don't know where we will be, what we will be transformed into, but only if we follow God's guidance in our own context.&nbsp; Let ministers, pastors, leaders, churches, men and women ask, "What does God want us to be?&nbsp; What is His calling for us to become?&nbsp; And let us be bold on our journey as we venture into unknown territory.&nbsp;   God, strengthen our hands and feet for the journey ahead.&nbsp; Holy Spirit, guide us with your presence and prayers.&nbsp; Jesus, may we be morphed into you essence. Amen.

						   Last night my wife and I played our new favorite game, Trivial Pursuit (anniversary addition). I am 2 for 2 while winning last night on the pivotal question of which King in a deck of cards doesn't have a mustache. I guessed and said the right answer...King of Hearts.  My wife is amazing at the TV questions, which I am horrible but I tear it up in the Music category. Anywho, that's besides the point, I answered a questioned last night that said:  This artist's song was sampled to created the massive music hit "U Can't Touch This" by M.C. Hammer?  Answer: Rick James.  Well it didn't mean that much to me at that time except another roll at the dice. But as most of you have probably heard today, Rick James whose hit "Super Freak" in 1981 was an instant classic, died today of natural cases. Sure his career declined after some drug charges, convicted of assaulting two women in separate incidents, served a two-year jail sentence and deteriorating health problems, but this man could funk with the best of them. So to all of the Rick James fans out there lets have a moment of silence for the late great funk singer.  heeeeheeeeheee HHHEEEEYYYY!!!!

						   I spent some time today reading about Quincy Carter's quick departure from the Cowboys. Four days ago he was the starting quarterback for Dallas and lead them into the playoffs. Now he is unemployed. Why? Speculations say that he used illegal substances and failed a recent drug test given by the Cowboys. He has already failed the league's test and has been in rehab since he started in the NFL three years ago, and as critics say, this problem has followed Carter since his glory days at the University of Georgia. Whether he did use cocaine or marijuana is debatable, but Jerry Jones and Coach Parcells dished out some heavy and decisive punishment.  I'm glad to see teams take action like this. Am I a fan of the Cowboys? No. But I do respect their decision to be a team that will not tolerate behavior displayed by Carter. Kids look up to these players, they are role models. And why should they get special treatment? The answer is, they shouldn't. Steve McNair recently had his DUI case thrown out of court. Why, I can't say. But I hope that the justice system didn't dismiss it because he his a premier football player and a key society figure here in Nashville. And this whole Kobe case....  I just wish we would stop giving these athletes a break from crimes that people commit everyday. My wife used to be a probation officer and she would come in contact with drug users, DUI fellons, and society's dysfuncitonal. So why should these people be thrown in jail, put on probation and given fines and not our "role model" star figures?

						   In the story of Jeremiah, God wants to illustrate a point to his people by using a metaphor of an earthenware jug. God asks Jeremiah to take this piece of pottery and break it in front of his audience. Obviously the jug shatters into millions of pieces illustrating that God will break this people and this city (Jerusalem). Interestingly enough, Jeremiah's audience includes the leaders of the temple as well as the city (senior priests and elders of the people).  My parallel is this: Are we, as pastor or members of our community, broken? It seems as though our culture (especially the South) urges us to hide our faults and put up a front that says "Everything is fine and great with me." I truly believe that this "hidden brokenness" is what evades true community, whether that be in our families, peer groups, work places or religious establishments. And community is hindered especially when the "leaders" of these groups is the one that promotes this facade.  In regarding this position, Euguene Peterson says that this brokenness is not to be avoided. It is our culture that places this "success" on pastors, whether that is growing a church or having the right techniques to do so. Peterson says the catch is:  all the stories of spiritual leadership that we have in our scriptures are failures.  Just look at Isaiah and how God asks him to preach to the Israelites for his whole life, but he won't see any effect on what he does. That is failure in our culture's eyes. We have to be ready for failure in their eyes. If not, then we are seduced by culture to being "religious." And once we have been that broken clay jar, then we can allow God to reshape a mosaic that includes ourselves but also our fellow brothers and sisters.

						   Lesslie Newbrigin states that the greatest heresy in monotheism (Christianity, Judaism, Islam) is cherishing clause A ("I will make you a great nation,  I will bless you ") of the Abrahamic call while forgetting, suppressing, or ignoring clause B ("so that  you will be a blessing "). It seems as though we who have been called by God who have decided to follow Jesus must live this out everyday. Yes we are blessed, but lets turn that blessing around and use it for good.  I was blessed by my Dad yesterday as we talked on the phone. He celebrated another birthday this past Sunday with his mom and wife. My Dad has blessed my life by showing his humanity to me. Last year we took a road trip up to Oregon and it was great. We shared about our beliefs, he gave me some wise advice about marriage, we laughed, we listened, it was one of the best experiences I think I'll ever have with my Dad. I hope and dream of more times that will come in the future. Thanks Dad for being a blessing, not just to me, but to your family, your friends and every person you have ever worked along side. Hooray for Dads!

						   Last night, my wife and I along with our "newly married" small group helped build a fence for our church, Stones River. It was great to hold those power drills and feel the strengthen in my long fingers. After three hours of drilling, measuring, mowing, raking, and cleaning, we had a "professional" looking fence and yard. After we finished, John King (pastor) told us the future plans for the church building and the newly acquired house (next door) that now has a new fence. What was encouraging was his take of using the "future" church building for the community. He said, "How many churches sit throughout the week...empty?"  John is right. We can build some of the most 'state-of-the-art' technological and designer savvy church buildings. But is it just to accommodate those who are apart of the "Christian club?" And hear me out, I'm not just talking about weddings and potlucks. I'm speaking about using our buildings for a cause that extends beyond our belief system; using our space to serve the community whether those that use it belief the same as I might (again let's speak about different beliefs and not just different denominations). Our buildings should serve more like the Y rather than a medieval castle. In fact, I'm not sure I really like the hospital metaphor either (The "sick," "weak," and "hurt" come in seeking counsel and aid from the "wise," "strong," and "educated").  What would you choose to do with a church building in order to serve the community?

						   What a weekend! Moving is not fun. Period! Jennifer and I moved into a bigger apartment in the same complex so we didn't have to rent a truck or take a carvan across town. Many thanks to those who showed up to help out, especially those with big muscles. Sure we broke our entertainment center but we had fun doing it. Uuuugggghhh.  Today I started a new book called "The Gospel according to The Simpsons" by Mark I. Pinsky. Tony Campolo wrote the foreword to this interesting little piece of literature. Campolo states that Homer treats God as a sort of parachute where he hopes he never has to use, but he wants God to be there just in case. When deep trouble comes Homer's way, he turns to God and begs for miracles, but when they do happen, Homer is not a man of more deeper moral convictions or faith. God to Homer is more of a magic formula that you are able to  manipulate  spiritual forces so that the supplicant gets what he or she wants. Campolo points out that many people in churches today treat God the same way. How many of us have ever thought that if you didn't end your prayers by saying - "In Jesus' name" - you wouldn't get the desired results you sought? Instead of treating prayer like magic, we should  surrender  to the spiritual forces so that those forces (i.e. God) can do through him or her what those forces desire.
