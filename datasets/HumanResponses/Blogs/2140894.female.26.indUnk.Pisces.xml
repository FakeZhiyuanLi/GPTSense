        (yahoo)  The 2004 Tour de France will always be remembered as the tour where Lance Armstrong won his sixth tour. Ullrich's performance, Basso's, even Andreas Klöden's shocking second place, will all be afterthoughts. Virenque's seven KOM wins will be relegated to a footnote. All because Armstrong won his sixth tour in 2004. If he wins seven? Six will still be remembered in all the glory and fanfare.  Of course there were other stories. The unknown Frenchman, the young Thomas Voeckler. The boy who may be the next big thing for France. The Fassa Bortolo team that won without Petacchi. Cofidis' much needed stages wins. Jakob Piil and Jens Voigt in all of those breaks. The ever-changing green jersey competition. The fighting for the white jersey. These things will be remembered, but none so much as Lance's sixth tour victory.   ---  As for the 20th stage? The first part of it was pretty much like all other 20th stages. The only real difference was Dominia's Simeoni who decided to attack at least three times throughout the day. None of them were effective, for one reason or another. But other than that, the race to the Champs-Elysées was less than exciting.   The real racing began as the peloton started onto the Champs-Elysées. The pace started to speed up and a few breaks went off the front, but none of them were successful. At least until a group of about ten men, including Thomas Voeckler and Axel Merckx, gained what eventually ended up being a 40 second lead. They lead for most of the circuits, until Jan Ullrich and T-Mobile took over the pace making. But the break kept fighting capture, and then Juan Antonio Flecha jumped off the front. His attacked was the last straw for the peloton and they were captured. Eventually Flecha was too, right before the line.   The race for the green jersey was magnificent. The first sprint was won by Robbie McEwen, the second by Thor Hushovd. The final sprint to the line was at least sixteen sprinters long and, in the end, it was the young Belgian, Tom Boonen, who powered himself to the win. In a few years, maybe even next year, he'll be a real contender for the green jersey.     (cbs sportsline)  Boonen was part of the 'revolution' of young riders at this tour. From Fabian Cancellara taking the prologue and the first yellow jersey to Thomas Voeckler riding for 10 days in yellow to the 23 year old Russian, Vladimir Karpets, who not only earned the white jersey, but ended up 13th in the final general classification, to all of the young riders making it through those 23 days. This tour has given the cycling world something to look forward to.   The 'old men' are still around. 37 year old Scott Sutherland (Alessio-Bianchi) was in the Champs-Elysées 10-man break and Lance's team mate, 38 year old Viatcheslav Ekimov, finished his 14th tour. But this tour was all about then young guys. Aside from Lance's victory, the most inspiring story is that of 25 year old Thomas Voeckler. I know I've waxed poetic about him, but he deserves it. He proved us all wrong, he proved that a little known French cyclist and his team without a strong leader, could dominate, in one way or another, the peloton. Sure, he didn't make it to Paris in yellow -- but then again, he didn't need to. At least, not this year.  This tour was exciting in it's own way. Sure, last year's was closer, but this year had a lot more tension. Lots of crashes, lots of stories and lots of records breaking or almost breaking. If Zabel had won, he would have held the record for the most green jerseys. But, in the end, it turned out that everyone who came in wearing one for the four jerseys completed the race with them.    (cbs sportsline)  Robbie McEwen managed to keep his green jersey, in spite of all of the competition. Lance, of course, is in yellow. Record breaking Richard now has seven KOM wins to his name. And the new boy on the block, Karpets, took the jersey from Voeckler in spectacular fashion.   It was fun writing about the tour these 23 days. I can't wait until next year to write all over again. Perhaps one of these days, I'll be in France and reporting from the 'front lines.' But until then, I'll be watching on my TV.  As for next year? Lots of questions remain unanswered. Will Ullrich finally have the team he needs? Will Basso improve his time trialling skills enough to compete on every stage? Will the tour be dominated, as it nearly was this year, by the young guns? Will Voeckler be the next tour winner for France? Will Virenque retire or try for eight? And, of course, the real question. Will Lance be back for a seventh win?  Who knows, but next year promises to be just as exciting.     (cbs sportsline)

      One more stage left.    (cbs sportsline)  It was certainly more exciting than yesterday's stage. The weather started off poorly, but unlike last year the weather completely cleared for the top half of the classification. What happened? Well, barring disaster, Lance will be riding into Paris in yellow. He'll be breaking that record. But enough of that talk, he said in an interview with Craig from OLN that there's still one stage left. My guess? He'll be fine. But you never know.  As for the stage, well, there were a lot of impressive rides today, many of them from the Americans. Although the rest of the USPS team, as well as Jens Voight, Vladimir Karpets, Andreas Klöden, Ivan Basso, and Jan Ullrich (among others), were amazing.  The top 15 looked like this:      1 Lance Armstrong (USA) US Postal p/b Berry Floor                    1.06.49    2 Jan Ullrich (Ger) T-Mobile Team                                        1.01    3 Andreas Klöden (Ger) T-Mobile Team                                     1.27    4 Floyd Landis (USA) US Postal p/b Berry Floor                           2.25    5 Bobby Julich (USA) Team CSC                                            2.48    6 Ivan Basso (Ita) Team CSC                                              2.50    7 Jens Voigt (Ger) Team CSC                                              3.19    8 Vladimir Karpets (Rus) Illes Balears - Banesto                         3.33    9 Jose Luis Rubiera (Spa) US Postal p/b Berry Floor                     3.40    10 Jose Azevedo (Por) US Postal p/b Berry Floor                          3.49    11 George Hincapie (USA) US Postal p/b Berry Floor                       3.56    12 Levi Leipheimer (USA) Rabobank                                        4.06    13 Santos Gonzalez (Spa) Phonak Hearing Systems                          4.17    14 Aitor Gonzalez Jimenez (Spa) Fassa Bortolo                            4.33    15 José I.Gutierrez Palacios (Spa) Illes Balears - Banesto               4.53    Although USPS had a high number of riders in the top 15, they're still 2 minutes and four seconds behind T-Mobile for the team classification. I suppose since Jan won't make it onto the podium in third, the team win will have to do. Oddly enough, the same thing happened to Tyler Hamilton last year. He was fourth behind Vino and CSC won the team classification. I wonder how common that is.   As I said before, there was some amazing riding. Although Christian Vandevelde (Liberty Seguros), didn't make the top 15 (he was 24) he started the American "take over" of the time trial. But, aside from Lance, the two most impressive rides of the day were by Bobby Julich and Floyd Landis, who appears to have the potential to go win stages, maybe even next year. Bobby was the first man that broke the one hour and ten minute mark. And then Floyd flew through the course and blew away all of Julich's times. For a brief moment I thought Floyd might have a chance to come in second or third.    (gettyimages)  But, of course, the four strongest men of the race still had to finish. And Lance, Jan and, surprisingly, Andreas sent Landis down to fourth. Which, all things considered, is still excellent.   Speaking of the top four, Ivan Basso's time trialling skills were much improved, even compared to earlier in the tour. I think he should have been praised for coming in as high as he did. I thought (and secretly hoped -- as I wanted Jan on that podium) that he was going to lose a lot more time. Instead, he just slipped (by a few seconds) into third. I have to admit I was rooting for Lance to catch him, but in the end it didn't happen.  As for the man who is now in second? Andreas Klöden continues to impress me, as well as live up to the national champion jersey on his back. He is being heralded as the new leader for T-Mobile, but (as I said in the previous entry) that's something I'll talk about later. His ride today, though, was just beautiful.     (cbs sportsline)  Near the end of the stage, I thought (as did Phil and Paul) that Klodi was going to overtake Jan. He didn't, which is probably good for both of them, but it was close. 26 seconds between Jan and Klodi. I had no idea he was that good of a time trialist. But it was obvious he'd set his sights on second and he wasn't going to stop until he got it. And somehow he did. Although he is six minutes and thirty eight seconds behind Lance, he's only twenty one seconds in front of Basso. It was some ride that Klöden did today.   Richard Virenque came in at a respectable 36th and will ride to France tomorrow with his seventh (record breaking) KOM jersey. As for the green jersey? We'll see where that leaves us tomorrow. I'm pretty sure Robbie with take it, but you never know. The race is tight. Thor could surprise us all.   And what does that leave us with? The sad story of former race leader (and French darling) Thomas Voeckler and the white jersey. He had 45 seconds to lose and he did, in dramatic and heart wrenching fashion. His two closes rivals, Sandy Casar and Vladimir Karpets, beat him to the line in spectacular fashion. Casar came in six minutes and four seconds behind Lance, Karpets was three minutes and thirty three seconds behind Lance. Thomas came in nine minutes and forty one seconds behind Lance. It's not fair at all, but Karpets certainly deserves that jersey.   As for Thomas? There's always next year, for yellow anyway. And I'll be there (at least metaphorically), cheering him on.

      Today's stage was possibly the least interesting stage of the tour. I was a really bad fan and only paid half attention, I don't plan to repeat that tomorrow or Sunday. But today? I don't know.         (yahoo)  There was a break that eventually ended up almost 12 minutes ahead of the peloton. For a brief moment, before OLN's coverage began, Lance Armstrong and Filippo Simeoni (Domina Vacanze) bridged the gap to the break for reasons that I don't quite understand as I'm not sure of the complete story (more can be found at  urlLink cyclingnews ) and then sat up and waiting for the peloton. We saw tape of the two catching up with the gap, but that was about it. Apparently one of the riders in the break asked Lance to drop back, and he said he would, only if Simeoni (who is suing Lance) did. And eventually they were captured.  That was, of course, the most exciting thing until the final sprint for green jersey points. The scenery was nice, but the stage didn't really catch my interest, except for a few times. Of the boys in the break, only Sébastien Joly (Crédit Agricole                                    )and Marc Lotz (Rabobank) caught my interest. And, of course, neither of them won. Instead, Juan Miguel Mercado (Quick Step-Davitamon) beat out the more experienced José V. Garcia Acosta (Illes Balears - Banesto) for the stage win. Acosta just got caught in a bad position and Mercado moved at just the right time. He sat on Acosta's wheel and then launched himself. It was a somewhat exciting win.    (yahoo)  I'm not sure how many wins Quick Step has now, but it's at least three. Tom Boonen won, then Richard and now Mercado.   About six minutes later, Sandy Casar attempted an attack off the front of the peloton. He wanted to gain time for the white jersey on both Thomas Voeckler and Vladimir Karpets (Illes Balears - Banesto). It was an excellent attempt, but Karpets' team put pressure on the front of the peloton and brought Casar back after a few minutes. Then the sprinters' teams took over and there was a short race to the finish.     (yahoo)  I was screaming for Zabel, of course. But once I saw he'd gotten himself boxed out, I was yelling for Hondo, Stuey, and Hushovd. Thor did, in fact, take the highest sprint points. But he was followed by Robbie, Hondo, Stuey, Carlos Dacruz (FDJ) and Zabel. Unless something horrible happens to Robbie, his teammates will probably protect him well enough on Sunday that he'll ride away with the jersey. But the numbers are close enough that it will be exciting.   Robbie:  238  Thor: 227 Zabel: 221 O'Grady: 215 Hondo: 201  Thomas still has his 45 second lead for the white jersey, but anything can happen tomorrow. My fear is that Karpets is going to wipe Thomas off the charts during the time trial. But we'll just have to wait and see. And, of course, Lance is still in yellow. And, barring disaster, I believe he'll remain in yellow tomorrow and wear it into Paris. As for second and third? It'll be Jan and Klodi, I just don't know which order.   It is time for the time trial yet? I'm so ready.    (yahoo)

      Three more stages left.   I was reluctant to post right away for three reasons.   One: There usually aren't a lot of good pictures so soon.  Two: My emotions were running high and my personal bias would have shown through a lot stronger that I would have liked.  Three: I was (and still am, for the most part) completely exhausted. Yes, I woke up at six am to watch live cycling. Granted, it didn't start until 6:30, but that's another story.   Anyway, I'm finally ready to tackle this stage.     (yahoo)  My personal bias was/is related to Andreas Klöden ('Klodi'). I don't know why, but as soon as the final group was thinned to Landis, Armstrong, Ullrich, Basso and Klöden; I knew that Andreas was going to do something. I actually pegged him for the stage win, and I really thought he had it. Then again, I thought Carlos had it, too. And, even earlier, I thought either Gibo or Richard was going to get it (or even Christophe if I was lucky). Turns out I was wrong on all counts.   It was really disheartening and I was kind of annoyed with Lance, but I've since overcome it.  People have been calling Lance selfish and I am not sure what my feelings are. Sure, he just won four stages, but Jan Ullrich himself said that "Lance is too strong" ( urlLink BBC Sport ). Again, I have to confess that I really wanted Andreas Klöden to win. I'm not sure why (thought I've provided  urlLink April  with a bit of fun -- she's been calling me a traitor the past two days), but I think it has something to do with my irritation with Jan Ullrich (although that's changed -- something I'll probably address in  urlLink Wannabe  at some point in the near future). Also, part of it was the whole 'he's finally going to be able to prove himself' idea. But, in the end, it was Lance who pounded out the win.  Not to say that I wasn't impressed. Or that I would have been happy of Landis (or even Ullrich, really) had won the stage. Just not Lance. I almost feel bad saying -- especially since I think the final time trial will determine the winner of the tour (not as tense as last year, but it'll be something not to miss) that. But it's true, I would rather have seen someone else win the stage. Anyway. There were several men of the day, including Gilberto Simoni and Christophe Moreau (and Richard, but I'll talk about him later), but the man who impressed me was Floyd Landis.   In the past week, Jose 'Ace' Azevedo has been the man at the front of the peloton. He's been the guy driving the pace, keeping up with Lance until the end. Today? It was none other than Floyd Landis. I have never seen him ride so well, and it was my impression that neither had anyone else (with the exception of Lance and the other Posties, of course). Before Andreas made his move, we (my family and I) were all rooting for Landis. It would have been amazing if he'd won, and I'm still a little upset about that as well. I know Lance wanted him to win.    (yahoo)  But he didn't. Though it was incredibly nice of Lance to dedicate his win to Floyd, and the rest of the team. They deserve the phrase.   This morning I loved OLN. Why? Right at 6:30 am I got to see cycling. Live cycling, none of the Bob and Al show for at least 20 minutes. And not only that, but it was the first mountain. And then? I got to watch the amazing wonder that is Richard Virenque. The man is amazing. He and Christophe bridged an almost six minute gap to get to the leading group. And, although Simoni tried hard and shook up the break, there was no stopping Virenque.   I have to say that when people ride with Virenque, they do amazing things. Watching Virenque, Simoni and Christophe riding up those mountains was like watching art in action. It was also interesting to compare the styles of those three to non-climber Rolf Aldag. The three climbers were sleek and smooth, graceful even. But Aldag? Not so much. He was struggling and you could see it in the way he rode. I was impressed, though, that he stayed with them for so long. But, in the end, they proved stronger and the mountains did him in. It wasn't enough to help Team CSC in the overall classification, but I hope that changes tomorrow. Since I predict T-Mobile will get two podium places.   Back to Virenque for a moment. One of his most impressive feats of the day was being able to ride up the Col de la Madeleine and fight the points out with Simoni. I am a tiny bit sad he didn't win them, but he's pretty much wrapped up the KOM, so it's all good.     (yahoo)  And last, the saddest note of the day. Thomas Voeckler was only just able to hang onto his white jersey. The Russian Vladimir Karpets (Illes Balears - Banesto) is 45 seconds down from Thomas. Sandy Casar is a minute 56 down. I'll keep my fingers crossed, but tomorrow's not necessarily easy either. Though certainly not as hard as today's stage. It was nice to see that Thomas didn't get dropped too far back. And the scene between Casar and Virenque sharing a water bottle was nice. But, oh Thomas, I want you to hang onto that jersey.    (yahoo)

        (yahoo)  That picture illustrates what might end up being the defining moment of the 2004 Tour de France. Lance, after starting two minutes behind Ivan Basso, flies past him. He climbs that mountain, all 10 miles of it, in just under 40 minutes. The man is insane. And if anyone is going to win six, Lance seems like the guy to do it.  Not that I'm counting out the others. Basso is only down 3.48, Klöden - 5.03, and Ullrich dropped down to 7.55. So you never know, tomorrow, after all, does bring more mountains. I have to say the rider of the day, after Lance of course, was Jan. He never looked like he was riding well, he looked, as Basso did, like he was laboring up that hill. But those time checks obviously told a different story. He, too, was flying up those mountains. And it landed him in a quite respectable second for the stage.  But, the real surprise of this tour (besides the French darling, Voeckler) was Andreas Klöden. For those of you not watching OLN, every time Andreas shows up on the TV, Phil or Paul mention how he did so well when he was younger (he's not that old, born in '75) and how he's just never done well. They always seem shocked to see him.     (getty)  Me? I think the jersey he's wearing must mean  something .  Overall, the stage was exciting. I managed to tape all four hours of it for  urlLink April  and then had it shipped next day (via USPS). It was that good. And exciting. Although I was kind of annoying by the sporadic coverage of the riders. It seemed as if we were only watching five or six riders for long periods of time. And the only time we got to see a lot of the others was when they were crossing the line. Now, I know it's hard to show everyone, but this seemed to be a little strained to me. Oh well, maybe it'll improve next year.   I do agree with Lance, though. The stage seemed dangerous. I know he (Lance) suggested that some German fans were making the trip up hard for him, but I didn't really see that. Granted, we didn't see all Lance the whole way up. But it wouldn't surprise me. Lots of drunk and loud fans. I was worried someone would get hurt, but thankfully that didn't happen. Even the sprinters (including both Thor and Robbie) made it across the line. Robbie even had the energy to do his trademark wheelie. It was amusing. But I'm still rooting for Erik.   My favorites? Mostly didn't fair so well. Matt came in dead last -- well, not completely. Only after Davide Bramati and Aart Vierhouten didn't make the time cut. Sylvain was 25th - which was good, but as CN said, he looks exhausted. Richard came in 38, which was good, but not great. He didn't even look winded when he crossed the line. Probably saving himself for tomorrow. And as for that boy in white? He came in 88th. Struggling and pushing and getting one of the loudest cheers.     (getty)  Here's hoping he can keep the white jersey. He's 3.33 ahead of Vladimir Karpets and 4.24 ahead of Sandy Casar. I hope he can find the last bit a strength to fight his way through the mountains tomorrow. I want him on that podium in Paris.   Can Lance do it? Or, has he done it already? I know lots of people (Phil included) have suggested (or outright stated) that it's over. That Lance has taken the sixth and the next few stages are but a mere formality until Sunday. I don't know. I think he's probably won his sixth, but I'm not being preemptive. There's still a long way left to go and another time trial. I think that Lance got the boost he needed and the USPS camp can sleep easier tonight, but I don't think the race is over yet.   I'll give you my final predictions, and I have two.  1. Lance 2. Andreas/Jan 3. Jan/Andreas  It all depends on the time trial.  1. Lance 2. Jan 3. Ivan  This one is less likely, as Basso doesn't appear to have the strongest time trialling skills, especially compared to Lance. Either way, I'm happy with Lance on top and Jan second. But we'll just have to wait and see.     (getty)

      I am not bitter, I promise. Just a little sad. I know, maybe I was disillusioned, but I really wanted, as Phil said, to see Thomas start last for the TT tomorrow. But it was not to be. Instead, he finished a full nine minutes and 30 seconds behind stage and new race leader, Lance Armstrong. Thomas somehow hung onto the white jersey, even though Sandy Casar crossed the line ahead of him. That boy never gives up. I hope we see him in white all the way to France. He is by far the best "rookie" on this year's tour.     (getty)  Maybe next year, Thomas.   The stage itself. Well, I called it. Even if he didn't make up much time, he started to climb up the classifications. Who, you might ask? Why, Jan Ullrich.  urlLink Yesterday  in my rest day recap, I suggested that T-Mobile might be playing us. And I was right. Everything appeared to be set up for Andreas, but really? It was for Jan. And, get this, I actually feel bad he didn't do better. Although, he needs to learn how to descend a mountain better. I was worried, at least twice, that he was going to go off and down.   I really hoped Richard was going to get his second stage win. But Jan, man, once he got going, there wasn't much anyone could do. I think that's partly why Thomas lost the jersey. The pace was tremendous and most of the peloton was struggling to keep up, most were just barely hanging on. I am most impressed, though, by Levi, Jens, Carlos and Andreas. Andreas not as much, because we've seen what he can do. And Carlos did some great rides last year. But Jens and Levi? After all those breaks, I still can't believe how much energy Jens had to help out USPS chase Ullrich and his mini-break down. And Levi. I keep hoping he'll do better. He was the other person I wanted to win the stage.   But, alas, it was not meant to be. Lance played it safe, although he managed to scare Phil and Paul when he dropped to the back of the leading break near the end of the stage. I figured he was there for a reason, and he was. Just waiting until the right moment. And then he just shot by Basso. It even impressed my father, who doesn't like cycling. As much as I wanted Thomas to win, it was fun to watch Lance. The man is just amazing.   Tomorrow. Almost as bright and early as Saturday, but not quite. I'm excited, but I think the OLN staff is even more excited. They've already put their "Alpe d'Huez TT" commercials out in full force. It's kind of scary, really. It should be interesting, especially if the weather's bad. I hope that Thomas has the ride of his life and stays in white. And Lance? Now that he's in yellow, I want him to stay.   As for the green jersey? I'm not evil, really, but if Lotto's worried that  Alpe d'Huez  might take out Robbie, then who am I too complain about that? Stuey, Thor or Erik for green. And, of course, Baden for Paris - "Mission Paris" as the FDJers are calling it.   I think this picture sums up the day. I wish it was Thomas in yellow.    (yahoo)

        (yahoo)  My top ten (since I really did ten last week as well) list:  1. Thomas Voeckler Oh, come on, like you totally didn't see that one coming. He was first on the previous  urlLink rest day  as well. Why? The kid (even though he's just about a year younger than I am) is amazing. He never quits. Watching him climb those mountains -- especially on Saturday, was amazing. Inspiring as well. Even Richard Virenque agreed, he said something to the effect of Thomas 'putting ants in their [French cyclist's] pants.' He's proving to be a strong rider. And, of course, now Thomas (and Sylvain) are going to the Olympics. What a way to round a good year.  And, of the record,  I  knew who Thomas was before this tour.  2. Brioches La Boulangère Again, not really a surprise. They're called the 'baker boys' for obvious reasons, but really? They're just damned impressive. Over the past week and a half or so they've been working harder than any team out there -- even USPS at some points. They know how to drive the peloton. And they know how to support Thomas. Especially (and I know I wax way too poetic about him, forgive me) Sylvain Chavanel. He is Thomas' right hand man, and he is almost  always  there. And if you look at the results for those two mountain stages? Sylvain comes in right around Thomas' time (either before or just after). Why? Because he's right there, helping. I said it before (and if someone can find out where I read it, I'd really appreciate a link) and I'll say it again, Sylvain said he'd give everything to keep Thomas in yellow -- and he is. The whole team is. It's a pleasure to watch.  3. Ivan Basso Phil (or Paul) said that Lance and Ivan are some sort of friends. And Ivan, like so many others in the peloton, is wearing a yellow bracelet. His mother apparently has cancer, so that win? Must have been so amazing for her. Like Thomas, Ivan is young (26) and really just coming into his own. Part of why he's so high up is because of his DS, Bjarne Riis. I swear that man works miracles. Just look at Bobby Julich (well, not now -- poor guy and his wrist). And now, Ivan. Taking full advantage of his talent. I know why so many riders flock to CSC. Working for Bjarne seems to be really rewarding. Part of me thinks Tyler never should have left. But anyway, back to Ivan. It was really fun to watch Lance and Ivan fight out both wins. I don't know if Lance gave Ivan that stage win or not, nor do I care. It doesn't matter. It was fantastic to see someone else up there, pushing right up next to Lance. I hope Ivan can take second on the podium (that is, if Thomas can't keep himself in yellow).  4. Lance Armstrong I don't know if you've heard of him ... Doping scandal aside, this man is amazing. Just watching him (and USPS) pushing up those mountains blows my mind. And it makes me smile to think that people kept saying "Lance is so far down, he'll never make up that time" and then he flies back up the classification in just two days. I know, not surprising to most cycling fans, but still fun to watch.   5. Breakaways. Every single one. Even if they don't make it, don't play it just right, or if they win the stage. Regardless, they're usually a pleasure to watch. It's always fun when they do win. Like Phil says, when they've been out for that long -- you feel they deserve to win. And it's always sad when they all can't win the stage. Some of the best sprint-finishes have been in breaks. But I must confess that my favorite break was the one with Virenque. He took charge and dropped poor Axel and then won the stage. My kind of break.  ---  6. Tyler Hamilton All I really have is 'poor Tyler.' Those photos of his back hurt to look at. Sometimes I wonder if he'd been better off with CSC still, but we'll never know. I'm so sad he had to abandon. I was hoping he'd make it all the way through. Next time, as I think I said before, Tyler needs to fall  before  the tour. Maybe next year, Tyler.  7. Iban Mayo Those Euskaltel riders like to ride in the mountains, it's too bad we didn't get to see it. One of the most heartbreaking scenes as Iban when he wanted to quit. And then, when his teammates, fans and riders from other teams pushed him along? One of the most amazing sights ever (just like when people were helping Thomas up the mountains). As April said to me, one day they'll have their tour. Just not this year.   8. Jan Ullrich and T-Mobile Obviously Vino was a huge loss, as was leaving Cadel off. I don't know what's wrong with Jan -- perhaps nothing. After all (again as April said), he's only down by about  seven minutes. It's not the end of the world. Sure, Andreas is doing well, but whose to say this isn't just a ploy? Get everyone thinking that Andreas is team leader and then, when they're not paying attention, Jan will come creeping back up the classification. Don't count that boy out just yet.   9. FDJeux.com Some many problems with the team. Lost form, losing riders, sickness and, well, Bernhard has a problem with his bottom. At least Sandy's doing semi-well. I'm still (as I bet they are, too) hoping Baden'll pull out a win. Paris it is, I guess. It's hard to watch and think about last year. They did so well (even though Matt didn't make it past stage 11) and Baden won the green. And this year? Not their year. I'm crossing my fingers, though. At least Matt's still riding.  10. Everyone who has abandoned so far. From Sven to Haimar (Zubeldia) to Jakob (Piil). Nothing's harder, I guess, than abandoning (or not staring). Of course, Sven's was the hardest, emotionally. He broke down by the side of the road. Sebastian Hinault and Rene's were the hardest to actually watch. Major crashes always are. I wish everyone speedy recoveries.    The good, the bad and the painful. I am looking forward to the last week of tour. Then I'll pack up my room and move out. I'm heading to an apartment without OLN, such a travesty. I think I've accepted my fate of missing la Vuelta. Hopefully I'll have OLN in time for the Giro next year. I've enjoyed my cycling watching and don't intend to be without for that long.

        (yahoo)  For the first time I'm actually bitter that OLN doesn't cover the whole stage. Most of the time I'm just grateful that I can watch it at all. But today's stage? I hear the best part was the first two hours. Of which we so absolutely nothing of. Not even (that I can really recall) the little flashback things that they use when someone crashes. Nothing! Not that I minded watching the last two or so hours, but still.   Lots of Thomas and Sylvain. I like to see the boys having a good time on the stage. And it was nice that there wasn't a lot of pressure. The break that finally worked was interesting to watch, but I really would have liked to see the earlier attempts -- and not just because Matt was in one of them. But OLN decided, for whatever reason, that we didn't need to see it. So we watched what seemed like five minutes of  then ten minutes of commercials. Eventually, near the end of the stage, the amount of time they spent showing the race seemed longer than the commercial break.   Sad day for me, though. I'd picked either Christophe Mengin or Peter Wrolich to win. But for some reason, once Aitor Gonzalez got away, the Euskaltel riders seemed to stop helping the remaining 7 members of the break try to catch up to Gonzalez. In the end, he had too much of a lead out for Mengin and Nicolas Jalabert. Jalabert came in second, even though Mengin gave it a good go to the line. Very good riding in the break, but I'm still surprised that Gonzalez won. Perhaps the Euskaltel riders stopped working on purpose, or maybe they were just exhausted from keeping Mayo in the stage yesterday. Regardless, Gonzalez road well for the win.    (yahoo)  And then we had to wait thirteen minutes for the peloton to catch up. Six of those minutes were spent watching commercials. Then about two minutes of racing, more commercials, then the final sprint. Way to go, OLN (when I said I was done complaining about them? I may have lied.). Anyway. I was pulling for O'Grady or Zabel (or even Hushovd or Hondo). That Robbie McEwen, though. He just comes out of nowhere and takes the win.   The sprint was exciting. Especially the beginning of it, because no one was quite sure what was going to happen. Robbie had a great lead out, then Stuey had one. Thor was pushing himself up, as was Hondo. And I still think it looks like Hondo beat them both to the line, but it seems I'm wrong (not surprisingly).    (yahoo)  All in all it was an uneventful (compares to both the mountains and the first two weeks) stage. Good for Armstrong, Basso, and, of course, Thomas. Rest day tomorrow. And then the Alps.   > What do I think will happen?  Jan will try his comeback, Lance will take yellow and Thomas will do well in white.  > What do I want to happen?  Thomas, Thomas and Thomas.   We'll have to wait and see. Enjoy the jersey, Thomas. You deserve it.    (yahoo)

      No more pretense, I was all out cheering for Thomas. I know he can't hear me, in fact my TV can't even hear me, but that didn't stop me. I am totally biased, I wanted Thomas to keep that jersey. I probably would have been upset if he hadn't. My story of the day is Thomas and, of course, Sylvain. There are others and I'll talk about them, but first, Thomas and BLB.     (yahoo)  He deserved it. 22 seconds isn't a lot and he probably won't keep it in the Alps, but you never know. I'm not about to stop cheering and, flat/windy stage or not, I can't wait for tomorrow. Thomas worked so hard and part of me I kept thinking "this is it" while waiting for him to crack completely, but he never did. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew he could do it, I had faith. And, well, he did.   I woke up at ten to seven am this morning to watch this stage on OLN. And for someone who (for a variety of reasons) doesn't usually get up until nine or ten, that should tell you how much I love this sport. I didn't turn on my computer until about one pm, so I had no idea Sylvain was in the break. It was a really great surprise. I was really sad when he started to crack in the break -- for two reasons.   One: I wanted him to win the stage and take more mountains points.  Two: If he's out of energy, how is he supposed to help Thomas?  Well, I was wrong on both counts. He didn't win the stage, but he did everything he could to help Thomas. And it worked. He spent a lot of time after the break taking care of Thomas, mostly letting him draft. But still, it was amazing. I'm so proud of both of them -- and so glad I got to watch it. And those last four minutes and 42 seconds were agonizing. But when he (and we) finally figured out that he was going to keep that jersey (if only by 22 seconds) it was all worth it. I just don't really have the words. I'm so completely involved in the tour this year. Even more than last year, when I got all worked up about Lance and Tyler.   Speaking of Lance and Tyler.  For me, this day was fabulous. The only way it could have been better is if Sylvain (or Thomas) had won the stage. But hey, sometimes I can be realistic. And we all know that I would be happy with either Thomas or Lance winning. So watching Lance take Basso almost to the line was exciting and fun. The crowds though, man. They are always something else, makes the stage even more stressful to watch. But, yes, such a great day for me.  Not so much for my friends, April and Katie, though. April's boy, Fabian Wegmann, abandoned and then Tyler Hamilton -- Katie's favorite -- did as well. My favorites? All still there. It's not fair, but then again neither is life.   I don't know exactly what happened to Fabian. April mentioned that he was having breathing problems. I imagine he's not the only one, poor boy. I hope he gets better soon. As for Tyler? I feel horrible for him. I was shocked, but someone mentioned that earlier in the stage Tyler was riding and holding his lower back. And then when someone working for OLN (I think) interviewed him, he said that he couldn't ride well because he couldn't really use his lower back. He also said that he had never once thought of abandoning, but once someone mentioned it, he realized (and I'm paraphrasing big time) there wasn't really any way he could go on. I mean, how do you ride without your lower back? Honestly.    (yahoo)  Cyclingnews pointed out that "Somewhat ironically, Hamilton's abandonment coincided with the day that the Tyler Hamilton Foundation arranged for movie theaters across the USA to screen today's stage live." If it wasn't so sad, it'd be funny. Ahh, Tyler. You should have crashed harder before the tour. Toughened yourself up.   Other things? Matt came in (with the autobus) 42 minutes later. He's now 2.02.03 behind Thomas. At least FDJ's not the worst team and Sandy Casar is doing okay. He was 21st in the stage -- the kid is good. Iban Mayo. After Tyler's abandon, that was probably the most heartbreaking thing to watch. He was off his bike, ready to quit, and they talked him back onto it. They being teammates, DS, and fans. Then, as riders streamed past him, they'd put hands on his back to push him along. I agree with Phil when he says that it's more mental with Mayo than physical. He wanted to do so well and everything has just gone wrong. Speaking of things going wrong, poor Roberto Heras. Crashed and lost even more time. What a way to be a team leader, sometimes the pressure is just too tough.  Good things? That Ivan Basso is damn impressive, as is T-Mobile's potential new leader, Andreas Klöden. As long as Klöden keeps staying up front, the more I believe he earned that National Champion jersey. Other impressives? Gerolsteiner's Georg Totschnig, who is now in 6th, 6 minutes and .02 seconds behind Thomas. And, after Thomas, one of the most impressive rides of the day was done by Christophe Moreau (Crédit Agricole). He had that flat on the mountain (I think it was the Plateau de Beille, actually) and had to change tires with a man on his team. The tire didn't seem to fit right so they spent about 30 seconds (probably -- it did seem like longer, though) adjusting his bike. And what'd he do? Road himself into eighth, 2.51 behind Lance.   Of course, Thomas will remain the most impressive to me. He just doesn't quit. But a lot of credit has to go to BLB for taking really good care of him. Walter and Sylvain have spent themselves on him and I'm sure they'll keep doing it.   Teams. Whoever said (either Paul or Phil) that Lance had the best team in the tour was right. They've got it figured out and you can't even tell that they lost Roberto. Jose is amazing. He just cranks the pace -- turns the screws -- and the rest of the peloton -- what's left of it -- just collapses. Except for Ivan Basso. But today? Lance was having none of that. He said he couldn't shake Basso, and it certainly looked like it, even though Basso seemed to be suffering a lot. But then again, it was the Plateau de Beille.   I was happy when Lance finally blew away (not that it was that far away) from Basso for the win. I was thinking "it's about time!" And then I started watching the seconds tick by. Fingers crossed. Waiting for Thomas. And he came through, much to my delight.   So, Thomas is still in yellow -- for at least one more stage. And Lance won the day. I wonder what's in store for next week. I'm excited.    (yahoo)

      Almost every article you'll read this afternoon/evening will state that the man of the hour is Lance Armstrong. Some will even include the stage winner, Ivan Basso. But I am not one of those people. I'll admit that this stage was extremely exciting to watch and I expected Lance to pull out all the stops and take the win. Of course, I wasn't really surprised when he didn't. After all, today was all about gaining time.  People will also be saying that stage twelve was when the 'real tour' started. And, in a way, I agree. But not because USPS, in the end, couldn't pull Lance over the top. Not because Ullrich, Hamilton, and Mayo were all but dropped. Not because Ivan Basso beat Lance for the win. And not because Lance gained five minutes -- although that's probably the most realistic reason I can agree with.   What, you might ask, have I learned from this stage? Well, lots of things and most of them have to do with racing in the rain, cameras and helicopters, and how to break apart a peloton. But, what I learned, what ended up being most important to  me  was the fact that I learned who I'd really like to see win. And, much to my suprise, it wasn't Lance. But, watching Thomas Voeckler struggle up that mounting, I was yelling like the Basque fans, for him. "Go Thomas!" and "Allez Thomas!" were a few of the cheers that my TV (and my parents) had to endure. I was also yelling at Sylvain Chavanel for not helping Thomas (but, it turns out that wasn't the case. Sylvain finished -- though about a minute back from him -- next after Thomas. He was there.). I learned that while I think it would be cool for Lance to win, Thomas -- the little French boy who came out of nowhere -- is the one I want.    Now, I know that's not probable, and I'm almost certain he won't be in yellow after tomorrow's stage. But it didn't stop me from caring more about him than Lance. It didn't stop me from wanting to know where he was, even though everyone else was watching Lance and Ivan. Even while I was cheering for Lance (because, if not Thomas, then Lance) I was worried about Thomas.   What I learned from today is what kind of fan I am. Something I've known, but occasionally forget. I get lost in the all the hype of Lance on OLN ("only lance network") and forget that I'm the type of fan who goes for the underdogs (with a few exceptions -- Richard Virenque being one of them as well as, tennis-wise, Andy Roddick -- I still don't understand that one). And while many people believe Lance is the underdog, I do not. He is the clear favorite and I believe he'll win. But that doesn't mean I have to constantly root for him. I was all about Vino earlier. Anyway, I'm completely off my point. Today's stage proved to me that I take cycling personally, that I love this sport, and that, when it comes right down to it, I know where I stand. I want Thomas to win. I want to keep that jersey. To keep going. It's part underdog and part the fact that he's just working so hard.    So. The men of the day for me? Richard Virenque and Thomas Voeckler. Why Richard? It's easy. Even though he attacked a few times, he, too, was dropped. He ended up in a small group with Thomas. What did he do? Attack? No. He talked to Thomas, he spent a lot of time -- more than he needed, more than he was ever obligated to do -- helping Thomas. He tried hard not to let Thomas lose too much time. And that, right there, that impressed me.      (getty)   Ok. I feel better. Now, for the rest of the stage. No big crashes, but man, the weather was shocking. It was really sunny, then Phil and Paul started talking about thunderstorms and about 10 minutes later  bam  the tiny breakaway of four were covered in rain. And, before we realized it, so was the peloton (and, of course, the autobus -- chugging along). As I said before, this is what people like to call the 'real tour's' beginning. But I have to confess that I've really enjoyed the past fourteens days, especially stages 5 through  11  12 where Thomas Voeckler has worn that yellow jersey. Not that today's stage wasn't exciting or that Ivan Basso wasn't riding like a man possessed, because he was.      (lycos)   And I was quite impressed with him (and Lance, but not so much USPS). I was happy he won. As for Mr. Armstrong? I think he'd rather win the stage to put on yellow (which I believe he'll attempt to do tomorrow) than just win the stage. He would have wasted energy on a win without gaining even more time if he'd tried to take down Basso. So things went.    Oh, Jan. I don't know what Andreas Kloden was thinking. Maybe he got the go ahead. Maybe he was trying to pull Lance back. Maybe he decided to screw Jan over. Or maybe Jan's playing us all. I don't know what to think. And I should probably end this, as it's about to storm here and I don't want my computer to get fried (alas, the storm came before I had a chance to post and then I left town). So a final parting thought and picture, then I'm out.   At the end of the day? It stacks up like this:      General classification after stage 12    1 Thomas Voeckler (Fra) Brioches La Boulangère  51.51.07    2 Lance Armstrong (USA) US Postal p/b Berry Floor  5.24    3 Sandy Casar (Fra) Fdjeux.com  5.50    4 Richard Virenque (Fra) Quick Step-Davitamon  6.20    5 Andreas Klöden (Ger) T-Mobile Team  6.33     And that boy? That darling BLB boy. He's still in yellow. Good luck, Thomas. I'm rooting for you.

      Before I talk about this stage, three things.   Hey  urlLink CN , remember  urlLink this  post of mine? Thomas Voeckler is 25, not  urlLink 24  (look for "Voeckler gets by").   The other two. I mentioned Matthias Kessler of T-Mobile and Sebastien Hinault of Credit Agricole yesterday, and I wanted to follow up. CN posts the medical communique in the evening (EST) after each stage. Here are their notes for Matthias and Sebastien.  >  Sébastien Hinault (Crédit Agricole) - Brief loss of consciousness after crash at km 180. Sustained back injury and was taken to the emergency room in Saint-Flour for examination. X-rays revealed a fracture of the fifth vertebrae without neurological complications. He will remain under observation in hospital.   >  Matthias Kessler (T-Mobile) - Injured back after crash at km 172, taken to Saint-Flour hospital after finishing stage for further examination. X-rays revealed a fracture of the ninth rib on the left side and a bruised lung.   Although Matthias finished the stage yesterday (I still have no idea how he managed it), he obviously couldn't start today. The other "causality" of the day? Magnus Backstedt of Alessio-Bianchi. He abandoned a little over half-way through the stage. It wasn't long, just on the hot side. He hadn't been doing too well since his unsuccessful day in the break (the same break that brought such good fortune for Stuey and Thomas). Now, onto the rest of the stage.   A three-man break again. Phil and Paul and I were all wrong about this one.  Phil and I, I believe, both picked Flecha (who as at it again, he must be taking lessons from Jakob Piil and Jens Voight) while Paul (I think) picked Martinez. Flecha attacked Martinez while the third member of the break, Moncoutie (from the bedraggled Cofidis team), seemed to be barely hanging on. Martinez jumped on Flecha's wheel and they settled in. No sooner was Flecha's attack under control, when Moncoutie came out of 'nowhere' and road right by them. He didn't stop, opening up a 30 second gap that eventually ended at just over two minutes when the two Spanish riders crossed the line.   Yet another great day for the French. And for Cofidis, who so desperately need all the good news they can get. It was a really great move by Moncoutie and it caught all of us by surprise.     (lycos)  There were more mountains today, but nothing like what starts tomorrow (everything is a half hour earlier for those of us watching OLN). Even so, Richard got more points and Fabian Wegmann (check out my friend April's  urlLink fansite  for Wegmann), who won the green mountains jersey in the Giro D'Italia this year, put his name on the board.   Voeckler didn't appear to suffer as much as yesterday, and the cows (pictures anyone?) that briefly divided and disrupted the peloton provided much needed entertainment for the cyclists.     (lycos)  BLB had another great day on the front. They pushed the pace when they needed to and kept it in check the rest of the time. There wasn't too much running the peloton into the ground today. Although I don't expect that to last once USPS (color me optimistic) gains control.   Will Thomas keep the jersey tomorrow? It's a good question, I think he might be able to. I certainly hope he does. And if he does? He might keep it even longer. The big worry, though, is that when he finally does (that is -- if he does) run out of steam, it'll be a big fall. Which makes sense, because he's been riding under the weight of the jersey, and if he cracked, that's a lot of pressure on the shoulders of that 25-year-old boy. I'm holding out for a few more days of Thomas in yellow. Then? My guess is that Lance will take over. But I'm not counting Mayo out just yet, or Tyler and Jan, of course.   Tomorrow should be even more interesting, entertaining and fun. I look forward to stage 12. Oh, and one last thing. A year ago on Stage 11, Matt Wilson didn't make the time cut. This year? 164th. Good job Matt!    2004 Tour de France Prologue. (gettyimages)

      Happy Bastille Day! And I'm finally back on track.   Today's stage? It was fabulous. I didn't sleep through the pre-race (although I managed to get mad at Al again, but I can't remember why. I think it had to do with him implying, yet again, that the first few stages of cycling weren't very interesting. Phil called him on it. Thanks, Phil -- saves me from having to send my letter.). It was fun to see Richard Virenque, who has become a favorite of mine, taking those first few climbs (and, eventually, all of them). And then he, and the great Eddy Merckx's son Axel, were pushing up the mountains. I guess they'd talked about what they were going to do ( urlLink cyclingnews ) but Richard just went for the win and tired poor Axel out.   As bad as I feel that Axel didn't get up to fight for the stage, I'm really happy Richard won. I want him to win the KOM jersey and break the record. Hell, I wouldn't mind Erik winning the green for the seventh time, as long as Lance can win the yellow for the sixth (unless Baden can some how come out of nowhere ...). But now I'm totally off topic. Anyway. It was great that a Frenchman won the stage today.     (yahoo.com)  Not everything was great today. T-Mobile's Matthias Kessler had a horrible crash, but somehow managed to complete the race. He was 168th. Liberty Seguros' Angel Vicioso Arcos retired, it was sad to watch. He was barely even riding and I turned to my mother and said "he should just abandon" in a joking voice and then he did. I felt somewhat bad. But he'd fallen a few too many times. I hope he makes the team next year. Poor Roberto, though, losing a rider just when he'll need it the most. I don't know what happened to Saeco's Mirko Celestino, nor did I see Credit Agricole's Sebastien Hinault crash. But I did see the aftermath of Hinault (Kessler and Hinault were involved in a descent crash, but I don't think it was with each other).   For about five minutes no one, not even the race radio, knew who had fallen. I was worried it was a BLB rider or Mattias again. Obviously it wasn't, but that didn't stop the worry. Poor Sebastien was lying in a ditch (similar to a Fassa Bortolo rider -- Marco Velo I believe it was -- who crashed early on). His bike was not in good shape and neither was he. Eventually the race doctors got him onto a stretcher. Cyclingnews reports that "Kessler had cracked a rib while Hinault had a fractured vertebrae."     (yahoo.com)  Sad day all around.   For me, the most impressive (ignoring Richard's 200+ km break and win) part of the day was watching Thomas Voeckler. I know, I probably praise him too often, but I can't help it. He's only about a year younger than I am and he's just doing some great stuff. He made the break with the likes of Lance, Jan and Tyler. And a lot of his team did too (like Sylvain, who spent a bit of time at the back of that leading peloton helping Thomas out), which was great. But the highlight was watching him attack for time bonuses at the end of the stage. He didn't get them, but he came in fifth, right in front of Lance.   After the stage, Frankie interviewed him for OLN. And, in his lovely English, he was quite humble. He thanked his team for doing so well, but he had this slight bittersweet tone in his voice. Either Phil or Paul remarked that he was probably saying good-bye to the jersey in that interview. It was sad, because I was hoping he'd have it for at least one more day. I'm not holding my breath, but I'm not giving up hope, either.   He's done incredibly well so far, it'd be a shame if he lost it before the Pyrenees.     (gettyimages)

      So, Robbie won. Yeah, I'm not really happy about that. I know I should be, since I'm a big Aussie supporter. But I was rooting for, well, anyone that's not Robbie. Mostly Baden. Well, up until he was caught, I was cheering for the Euskaltel rider who'd never won anything. But, alas, he's still never won anything. And that Robbie, just coming out of nowhere. I slept through the pre-race yesterday so I didn't know that Phil and Paul had tipped him as the winner of the stage.   For a moment I'd thought either Steuy or Thor had won, but upon watching the replay (numerous times) and then seeing the photo finish, it was clear that Robbie had just powered his way to win. I don't know how he does it -- and apparently a lot of people don't like it, including Quick.Step-Davitamon and Credit Agricole. According to  urlLink cyclingnews , Quick.Step's DS Serge Parsani said "Work doesn't pay. McEwen got a nice present really. Don't work and still win, that's what you should do." I have no comment, really, except that Robbie takes wins when he can and know show to take advantage of other teams. He's a good rider, I just don't like it when he wins. Go Baden.    (yahoo.com)  One of the things I noticed was that the Euskaltel rider accidently got in Tom's way as the sprinters finally caught up with him. And thus Tom wasn't able to contend and his frustration was so obvious. It was disheartening to see him work so hard only to fall short. But I guess when you're a sprinter, that happens a lot. I'm just glad he's got a stage win. But really, how frustrating.  I thought the stage was exciting. I was shocked by the crash near the end (and by Jaan's abandoning, but such is the way of an 'old' tour rider, especially a sprinter) of the stage. I mean, how could you miss the little roundabout thing? The poor rider wasn't paying attention, I guess -- probably waiting until the last minute to decide which direction to go. Poor Kurt, it seems that all he does is fall (and get caught in breaks). Hopefully he'll be able to start (and he did). The rider just ran right into Kurt as both of them crashed and flipped over their bikes.   Good things. Thomas finished the race still in yellow and there was only one really big crash. I guess it's sad when you're happy about having just  one  big crash.   Tomorrow should be interesting. We'll find out what both Thomas and BLB are made of. As well as how the "big guns," as Al calls them, are doing. Mountains, yay! Not to say that I haven't loved the flat stages, because I have. Exciting all around for me.     (yahoo.com)

      In lieu of a post about Stage Nine (I'm still a little bummed about the results, so I'll sit on it a bit longer), I'll make up for my lack of posting yesterday.   Ten days of the tour and so far I've found it to be exciting, worrisome and irritating. There are things that tick me off, but I'm not going to go there. I'm sure there will continue to be annoying things and I'll will probably keep complaining about them. But this entry? I'm going to talk about the things that make me happy.   The Top Five:  1. Thomas Voeckler The 25-year-old French National Champion has won my heart. He didn't expect the jersey, he's fallen for it (so beautifully, I might add) and he's still a little surprised each time he puts it on. As if he doesn't quite believe it's real. That first day, after the amazing break, you could just see how unbelievable it was. He's even quoted as saying that the jersey "just fell into his lap." And, even more impressive, is the fact that his team -- even though they don't have a contract for next year -- has backed him up the whole way. They've done their stint at the front and continue to do it. I'm proud of them.  2. Matthew Wilson How could I not mention him? After all, he is my favorite rider. The first few days after the prologue were tough. He spent a lot of time helping Brad, even tough, in the end, Brad just couldn't go on. Nothing says teamwork like spending your days at the back of the race helping out your teammates. Then, after spending himself helping Brad, he manages to get up front in at least two of the past four stages. He's been pushing the speed and doing a great lead out for Baden. His positive and optimistic attitude is catching. One of these days, Baden's just going to beat them all.   3. Thor and Tom. I have to say that they are two of the strongest sprinters out there. Both had caught my eye long before the tour started, but it's been nice to see them both win stages. Especially Tom. I know he badly wanted to win in Belgium and I was sad that he didn't that chance. But it's nice to see the team still working for him, leading him out until they have to start helping Richard.   As for Thor? What a go for the boy from Norway. I was proud when he got the yellow jersey, and then green. And now that he's won a stage? So impressive. I hope he keeps giving Stuey and Robbie a run for their money. A good day for the champion of Norway.  4. Fassa Bortolo As much as I wanted Petacchi to win one stage, I'm almost glad he's gone. Though I'm not happy that he might not make the Olympics, but that's for later. It gives these young boys a chance to kick it into high gear. But, how lucky for his teammates that they've been able to pull out these wins. Most impressive performances from Fabian and Pippo. There was a great picture at  urlLink cyclingnews  of both boys together. Making FB proud. It would have been nice if Flecha and Kirchen had been able to hold their own for the wins, but it was not meant to be. Such is life.   5. USPS and Phonak Again giving a new meaning to team (although in my eyes, no one is as much a team as the FDJ Aussies). Both teams have come through when it counted. Both during the team time trial. USPS during the crashes and the cobbles. And, of course, Phonak through the crashes and all of their bike problems. I wish Tyler and Lance and their teams the best of luck. I hope Lance makes it to six and that Tyler doesn't fall off again. Oh yeah, and Tyler is so winning a mountain stage this year.   And that's all, except for the runners up. 6. CSC - Jens, Jakob and the team time trial.  7. Sandy Casar - the boy never gives up. He's giving hope to FDJ. I hope he keeps that white jersey. 8. Rene, Sven, Sam, and all the other crash victims - My heart goes out to them. As for Rene? It turns out he has internal injuries as well. I hope he gets better soon.  9. Paolo (and hopefully Richard) - The KOM jersey looks good on him. I hope it goes seamlessly to Richard. Seven, baby! 10. Paul and Phil - For putting up with all that crap from Al. And for entertaining me endlessly. Oh yeah, and for overusing the word 'undulation.' They must have said it at least 10 times on today's stage.   Well, that's all. I'm sure I'll have an even longer list during the next rest day. And sometime tonight I'll post my reaction to stage nine.

      I've been putting this off all day. I like Thor, I really do, I just didn't want him to win today. I wanted Baden to win, but, more than that, I really wanted the break to work and for Ronny to win. It's about time Gerolsteiner got some good news, then FDJ. So, the capture of the break put me in this grumpy mood.     (yahoo.com)  And Al. Oh, Al. I swore to myself I wouldn't complain about OLN's coverage again. But I lied. I'm sorry, but after the race ended and Paul and Phil went to talk to Bob and Al, the lack of respect for the majority of the cyclists displayed by Al really irritated me. I couldn't believe that he just wanted to talk about Lance and company -- even when people were talking about other things. And how he brought up all that shit about how this first week was really boring. I know I wasn't the only one offended because both Paul and Phil were talking over each other telling him it was exciting. So, this is my open letter to Al.  ---  Dear Al,   I know you'll never read this, but I need to tell you something. There are a lot of us out there who are watching the tour OLN. Some of us have favorite cyclists. And, even though I know you find this hard to believe, our favorite riders aren't always major contenders. In fact there are some people in the states who aren't even cheering for Lance.  Now, I want Lance to win, but I just think you should know that those of us whose favorite riders aren't Lance or [insert other 'contenders' here] have (in spite of all the Lance-centric coverage) enjoyed this first week of the tour. I, for one, while dismayed at the lack of coverage of one of my favorites (Sylvain Chavanel) was happy to be able to see my favorite rider (Matthew Wilson) racing.   Next time, just remember that not every one wants to know where Lance is every second of every day. There are other riders. And it's those cyclists I'd like to know about. I know there are a lot. But really, you have three weeks of cycling. I'm sure you could fit those stories in.   Please don't stop covering cycling, OLN.  Thank you, Sarah  ---  I feel much better now. Moving along. Thor. He won, he was wearing a yellow bracelet. The end. Okay, not really.     (yahoo.com)  I was cheering Kim on, even though Fassa has a lot of wins already. But, I have to tell you, it was kind of fun to watch Thor just fly (kind of like Tom, really) past Kim. And when we got to see the aerial view? There was no way (and Thor actually said) that anyone was going to catch him. When I was actually watching the final sprint (if you could call it that), I was sure Thor had thrown his hands up way too early. The angle (watching as if they're riding toward me) made it look like Kim was a lot closer than he really was.   I am glad he hung on for second though. And I'm also glad that there weren't too many crashes. Although, poor Samuel Dumoulin (AG2r). It was like watching Sven all over again.     (yahoo.com)  IT was this crash at the back (not the one with Cofidis, I don't think. It might have been, but I think that was the second. Though the Cofidis riders always seem to be involved.) and all we really saw was Samuel sitting in the middle of the road and a Liberty Seguros rider off to the side. The Serguros rider got back onto his bike, but Samuel took a really long time, and we followed him as he tried to get going again. It took him an additional 10 minutes, but he finally made it. According to  urlLink cyclingnews , he has a "serious contusion on left elbow" and "will undergo further examination." I hope he gets better tomorrow.   Not all of the stage was bad, although for a bit it looked like Jakob Piil was gunning for the yellow. But BLB put in a huge effort and kept the chase up. I hope they can make it through the mountains, because Sylvain (who, as I've already established, is a favorite of mine) is reportedly still having problems -- possibly with his back. It makes me sad. I suppose that's also why this stage put me in a bad mood (and the lack of Matt). Sometimes I'm just really picky. I've been good up until today, never really getting bummed when my boys didn't win. But, man. Maybe it's good that tomorrow is the rest day.   It's one day Thomas won't have to fight for his jersey. I hope he keeps it until the mountains. At least it's good to see that he enjoys it.     (yahoo.com)

      For those of us (by us I mean me) who like flat stages (in addition to everything else) and breakaways, today was another great day. I have to confess that the highlight was watching Matt, after getting stuck in the wrong half of a peloton split, rejoin and then get back up front to work for Baden. If only there had been an actual sprint. Not that 16th is bad for Baden, but still. I was hoping (though I'd picked Erik Zabel for the day, little did I know ...).   The lack of major crashes was good, except it hurt to watch Sven Montgomery. I don't really know what happened, except that it sounded like Sven and a Cofidis (can't they stay out of trouble?) rider crashed. We (the OLN audience) got to watch poor Sven be examined (his collarbone, of course) then get back on his bike, ride for less than a minute, and then wave his hand for the team car. He pulled off the road in tears, unable to continue. It was (to overuse my favorite word) heartbreaking. He's started the tour four times and never finished. Rene and Sven seem to have such bad luck in the tour. Although maybe it's just stage races for Sven, as I believe he also crashed out of the Giro this year.  Well. The rest of the race was fun to watch. I liked CSC cranking the peloton and splitting it with help from the wind. The second break contained (besides Matt, of course) the green jersey, Stuart O'Grady, and I was worried that Stuey wasn't going to make it. But Cofidis and Credit Agricole, with a little help from Saeco (I still can't believe Gibo didn't quit, but that's for another entry.) pulled the peloton back together. And therefore Stuey had enough time over Robbie to keep the green.     (gettyimages)  I didn't get to see a lot of the early breaks, which is frustrating because I think two FDJ (including Bernhard) attempted. But it was still fun to watch Dekker and Marichal go at it. Although, I wasn't really rooting for the breakaways, not even for Fabian Cancellara's, and I like him a lot. But, eventually, one of the breaks stuck. And there, almost out of nowhere, came Filippo "Pippo" Pozzato. I thought Iker Flores was going to take it (and was all bummed because my mom really likes Euskaltel - Euskadi), but there was no stopping Pippo.     (yahoo)  Before I go on, I'd like to point out that Pippo is wearing a yellow bracelet. Mine should be coming in the mail soon, and you all (if you don't already have them) should  urlLink buy some . When I get mine, I'll write up why I have one. But yes,  urlLink Livestrong .   Anyway. It was a good finish, not at all dangerous, which made me really happy. I think if the final break had been riding a bit more conservatively, there would have been more risks taken by the peloton to catch them and might have resulted in some crashes. But the weather was good and the peloton, while not organized, it was controlled. Speaking of organized. A lot of the sprinters' teams did a good job, just not enough. CA and FDJ in particular. I noticed Fassa up there too, which made me miss Petacchi even more.   Happy note of the day? Even though he struggled a bit on the short (really short) mountains during the stage, Thomas kept his jersey. I hope he keeps it for a while longer.     (yahoo)  PS. Would it be too much to ask for an FDJ stage win? Please?

      Good racing, good breakaway, though not good enough. Brioches did a fine job of protecting Thomas and chasing after the breakaway. I was happy that, in the end, Thomas came away in yellow again.     (lycos.com)  Most of the stage was made up of BLB putting the hammer down and the breakaway trying to be stronger than the peloton. They managed a high of maybe almost 5 minutes, but eventually they were caught. Although, by that time, BLB had secured Thomas in yellow of the next day and were sitting back. The sprinters teams, man. They totally took over.   It was fun to watch the breakaway try to keep away. From six down to four, and they were jumping all over each other's wheels. I would have liked to see FDJ's Carlos Dacruz come away with the win, but the peloton was having none of it. One winning flat-stage breakaway seemed to be enough. And poor Juan Antonio Flecha. He did the same thing last year, though I believe it was on a mountain stage, and ran away with the win. It was not to be, this year. He, too, was eventually caught.   Gerolsteiner, Lotto, Quickstep, FDJ, and others were putting a lot of pressure on the front of the peloton and Flecha's 50 second gap was eventually overcome. In the end, it was a great day for most of the sprinters. Steuy almost came away with his second win, but Tom Boonen just ran away with it.     (gettyimages)  Sad notes of the day. Cipo and Petacchi both didn't start. Rumor has it that this is it for Cipo. As for Petacchi? He had a hard crash yesterday:   "I'm really sorry I can't continue," he said. "It's a big disappointment to me, and basically it's because I just cannot raise my arm. Last year I came here and I was in worse condition but I managed to be a protagonist in the Tour. Now I'll just have to see what happens."   And then, argh. With about 10km left, I was going to tell my mother that I'm glad there hadn't been many crashes (just one at the beginning when Lance fell) but I didn't say anything, I didn't want to jinx it. In the end, though, it didn't matter. The race was almost over when suddenly there were a handful of sprinters (thankfully Baden and Hondo were among them) and no one else. The cameras panned back and there was a massive pile-up. When we finally got to see the replay, it reminded me of the footage of the crash on Stage One last year. Oddly enough, it happened right under the 1km to go, so everyone got the same time. But still.   And the cause of the crash? Most likely the peloton pressing too hard and the poor Gerolsteiner boy (who crashed hard in last year's tour as well), Rene Haselbacher. They have him finishing the race in 179th, but I assume he never really made it. I have no idea how he'd have been able to walk.   From cyclingnews:  Gerolsteiner sprinter Rene Haselbacher crashed hard into the left side of the barriers, smashing his left leg and chest and head at 60km/h. Haselbacher was taken to Angers Hospital after the stage, where a medical exam revealed a broken nose and three broken ribs.     (lycos.com)  And now I'm caught up and looking forward to tomorrow's stage. I really hope Baden can pull out some wins. Matt's no longer working for Brad, so he'll be able to be the lead-out man. And Baden only needs to win a few stages to catch up to Stuey (in green now, as Robbie crashed and didn't make it to the sprint). Allez FDJ!

      As if the weather could get any worse ... Rain for most of the day and crashes everywhere.     (lycos.com)  Most people didn't find the stage exciting, even many of the OLN crew. But I did. I think that it's because I watch cycling for cycling (among other things). I just like watching them ride down the road. It's probably why I need to be able to watch the race from the end of each stage, instead of out on the road. I like to see the whole thing (not that French TV does that great a job -- I'd blame OLN, but it's not their video, just a feed). But I didn't mind so much today, because, among other things, I like Brioches La Boulangere and, of course, FDJeux.com a lot and since Sandy and Thomas were part of the break (see above picture), it was exciting to be able to watch them.  Ahh, the break. They worked hard. They already had a 15-minute advantage by the time OLN's coverage started, so it was fun to watch them get down to something that would have been reasonable to catch, and then escape again.  And, oh, the crashes. So many. I was shocked and worried. People just kept falling and falling. And, even at the end, just when you thought everything would work out, BAM and down they all went. So painful. Phil and Paul said that it was probably like riding across sheets of ice. Poor Robbie went down as well, but still managed to hang onto the points classification for just one day.  Among the sad events, Maryan Hary just couldn't make it before the time. He was following Brad McGee at the back of the peloton for part of the race. Which leads me to the other heart breaking event, poor Brad. He finally gave up. Back injury and, probably, semi-bad form just did him in and he abandoned. So sad, and so bad for the morale of the team. He said, on his  urlLink site  that  I never imagined I would ever quit the tour. Finishing the tour is like breathing......you just do it. Yet here I am, on my way home after 5 stages. . Makes me sad. I'll miss Brad.  But, not all was lost. Sandy Casar was in that long breakaway and is third overall, which is quite nice. And, oh, the story of the day, though. The lovely Thomas Voeckler. His wildest dreams came true, along with a great day for France. The young (25-year old) Frenchman did wonders and managed to get a 10 minute gap over our race leader, Lance. I'm so proud of Thomas. French National Champion and now wearing the yellow jersey. I hope he keeps it until the mountains.    (lycos.com)

      The team time trial. It was exciting and completely not what I expected. The rainy conditions contributed to what I thought would be a relatively normal (if there is such a thing) day of team time trailing. But, alas, that was not to be.   For me, the highlights of the day were CSC, Phonak, and, of course, USPS. Most people pick Phonak and USPS as being the best. But CSC came through more than any other team. We knew that Phonak was strong, that Tyler could drag them on. And USPS? They wanted to win. But CSC? They fell and regrouped so many times that I thought it was all over. But somehow they crossed the line in 4th and ended up in 5th. And, to me, that's the most impressive.   I know people have said "well, they didn't end up first, did they?" And really, all I've got is that they probably didn't even expect to end up that high. T-Mobile got screwed, which was just fine with me. I was completely proud of BLB for not crashing as well as of Tyler's team. Crossing the line with only five riders was extraordinary.  And as for USPS? Wow. They fly. The pictures of poor Benjamin in tears, though, were heart breaking. I'm glad he wasn't eliminated, though.   But, oh, the worst was my boys. My poor FDJ. They were last (EDIT: Turns out they were just trying to survive and not get eliminated). It was sad to watch them, and then horrible to see them get passed by Robert Heras' Liberty Seguros team. My poor boys obviously didn't get it together. Let's hope things improve.    (from cyclingworld.dk)

      I did not get to see this stage live. I was on the road, on my way home from Ohio. And, sadly, after I discovered that Baden hadn't won -- I didn't pay much attention to the stage.   Except, of course, for the cobbles.   They were something else. But that crash, right before the cobbles? Not at all something I expected. Poor Iban Mayo. He fell and never regained those four minutes. Not that I really cared, but it's always frustrating and sad to see a top contender go down. Although, I'm not so sure how good his form was, considering he's just come off a huge win. But now we won't really know. And that, I suppose, is just too bad.  Yet another day filled with proof of how good USPS really is at taking care of their own. Eki and George got Lance through without any problems. Although, personally? I would have liked to be in the break -- the two riders didn't have to worry about crashing (and there were some minor cobble-related crashes, including poor Baden. Is nothing going right for FDJ?) into anyone but each other.   Eventually they were caught and there was a sprint at the end, but oh, man. The break in the peloton put a lot of people behind. Baden was stuck at the back of the second break and never got back up to contend for the stage win.   As for the sprint? Robbie just comes out of nowhere. He almost won, but once again Jean-Patrick Nazon goes in for the win. But Robbie has the yellow jersey, finally getting his place in history. Even though I'm not that fond of Robbie, I do like the Aussies, and so it's nice to see them at or near the top.  Now if only FDJ can get their acts together tomorrow ...

      Another long stage. More Matt, mostly up helping Baden (I think). I am curious as to where he ended up (EDIT: 15th). I was wrong about yesterday, apparently Nick Gates finished five minutes behind the time cut and couldn't start today (due to a crash, as well). So Brad and Matt weren't completely last. And it seems I am confused with the number of riders, someone just said the peloton has shrunk to 178 riders (EDIT: Not true. The day started with 187 and ended with 186 as Gian Matteo Fagnini of Dominia didn't finish).   Today was surprisingly crash-filled. That poor broken Dominia rider (see edit above). And then, right in the middle of the final sprint, Jimmy Casper (Cofidis) and  Kurt-Asle Arvesen (CSC) had such a painful crash. I'm happy that both of them finished. Hopefully they'll both start tomorrow.  What impressed me the most (besides watching April's Seb Lang (Gerolsteiner) pushing in the break) was Thor and the CA team. He crashed and still managed to get up to the front to get just enough time bonus in the sprint to take both the green and yellow jerseys. He looked so happy and he should be. I totally didn't think he'd make it. Speaking of the sprint, I (unlike Paul and Phil) predicted Petacchi for the stage. And it almost happened, but those CA boys just pushed up there. And then Robbie, coming out of nowhere to win. Impressive, even if I kept shouting for Baden. One of these days I am ready for Baden in green.  What I want to know, though, is what's up with Brad. I'll just have to wait about 16 hours, less if I'm lucky. Then I'll probably write about it (EDIT: It took longer for me to find out about his back, as most of the articles I read and the commentators didn't know until Wednesday).   I've mentioned it before, but I can't explain how much it surprised me. The large number of crashes in the stage. No one on OLN really addressed it, so these are just my wild guesses (side note: I think I just saw Matt in the rerun. Sad that he is the easiest to spot. Matt and Thor (and later, Thomas Voeckler) actually). I believe that the good weather caused some of the crashes: overconfident riders. And because of that, some nervousness.   One more complaint about OLN (a common theme, I think). Not enough updates on the speed of the peloton and breakaways. Lots of time distances, names (in breaks) and kms to go, though. Oh well, I'll be home soon enough for my "full" coverage.

      I can't go without mentioning all the unintentional Matt (Wilson) coverage. I am saddened because Brad looked like shit (and Phil, I believe, even described Brad as being broken). But, so much Matt! I know I'm horrible, really. But I enjoy seeing my favorite cyclist on national TV.  The word of the day is  not  Lance (okay -- it is OLN-wise, but not me-wise), but instead, it's "ouch." Tyler, Mario, Bernhard and others. All the different peloton breaks were really interesting to watch. Granted, though, at the end there were only two: the main peloton and Brad and Matt. This is the first time I've seen a tour from the beginning. Before last year, I'd only watched highlights. And then, last year, I started watching on Stage 12.  I do have some complaints about OLN's coverage. With tennis, even ESPN can tell you all the completed matches. But OLN? Apparently they find no need to tell me where all the riders are after each stage. The only way I knew Matt was 181st was because they showed a little (two lines) summary of him while he was helping Brad. Although I know that Matt is probably 187th of 188. And, sadly, Brad is 188th (EDIT: I learned when I finally got home, that Matt was actually 186th and Brad 187th, because poor Nick Gates didn't make the cut.)  Although my TV watching has been split between the Wimbledon finals (Gah. Roger. I wanted Andy to win) and the stage, I fully enjoyed and appreciated the rain-filled racing.   Also, if Al complains one more time about the lack of Lance coverage, I'm going to write an email (EDIT: Oddly enough, he never did). I wish they would show a little more respect for the other 187 riders.   Enough complaining. I truly enjoyed the final sprint. I must admit that I kind of expected Petacchi to win, but it was almost clear that the Fassa Bortolo train was not completely in control and thus didn't allow enough of a leadout for Petacchi.  (Quotes: The virus of cycling - Al. Ride to live, live to ride - Bob)  Other things I liked? The Thor-Tom-Fabian points fight. Jaan Kirsipuu (if only because his name is so much fun to say out loud). All the Matt (sorry Brad). Getting to see April's boys: Hondo and Baden. Fighting-Erik (don't give up, Erik!) Robbie losing (I am evil, I know). And, well, the rain. I'm a sucker for bad weather. I totally enjoy the excitement. Though, after Benhard's crash, I spent a lot of time praying that Matt wouldn't crash.

      Notes from the couch: 1. OLN still covers too much Lance. 2. Fabian Cancellara - was he also at the Giro? 3. Who, besides Mick, crashed? 4. Mario's kit = o.O 5. Thor! Brad!  Right, so OLN's coverage is not complete. At least not what I've seen, though I missed the very end of the live coverage. I watched just enough to see the adorable Fabian put on that yellow jersey.  Things I liked: The actual weather in Belgium -- well, most of it. Being able to see a lot of cyclists I don't normally get to see. The whole prologue (minus the crashes).  Things I disliked: Not enough information about the other riders. Too much Lance. The crashes. And sick-Brad.  I am not sure how I'm going to write this diary. So this entry is full of different styles. I'll probably try several before I finally get comfortable. ---  - Jan: I am always surprised by how many people both respect and dislike him. I suppose I, too, am guilty of this. Thought I am more annoyed with him than most. He did ride well, though. As did Tyler.  - Sylvain: 30 seconds of Sylvain (Chavanel) is not enough. He's French, you'd think they'd want to show more of him.  - Tyler: I wish he'd done better, really. I mean he did well, but ...  - Lance: People keep saying how Lance didn't expect to win the prologue, etc. But watching him cross that line two seconds behind Fabian, it was easy to tell how unhappy he was. I have faith, though, that Lance will come through. So close and so frustrated, though.   - Fabian: I have to admit that seeing Fabian cry and put on that yellow jersey was totally worth Lance coming in second.   Overall it was a good day. I'd really wanted Brad to win, but obviously something was wrong. I hope he figures himself out soon.

       urlLink Wannabe Bike Girl  is a blog about cycling, not just the Tour de France. Wannabe Bike Girl's TdF Diary is just that, a diary about my experiences watching the greatest race in cycling on OLN. Or, as my dad called it "the Wimbledon of cycling."   Essentially, this is just a place where I can rant, compliment and otherwise fangirl after each stage of the tour. I am five stages behind, but hopefully within the next two days, I'll have caught up.   For those of you who want to avoid tour spoilers, avoid this site until after you've watched the stages.

      The Giro is over and that makes me sad, though it also reminds me that I have other things to do. Like, oh, get a job. But, seriously, if I could do something with cycling for a living? I'd be happy. So happy.  Anyway. I should talk about the stage. No live!Giro for me and I actually had to tape the stage coverage because my sister and I went out to see  The Day After Tomorrow  (lots of fun). But I watched it when I got back and, oh, I do love Petacchi. One of the best things was watching him stop peddling before he crossed the line. He looked back, that one look, and then he knew he had it. It was so much fun to watch. And it was replayed so many times. I think the best views were when you could actually see how fast he was going, how he just flew off the front of the pack. That man is something else.  And now it's over. Gibo lost (I'd like to be sad about it, but...). Damiano won. Fabian won, and if I wasn't so lazy, I could look up the other guy. But I'm feeling lazy. I'm mostly pleased about Fabian and Petacchi. It was fun to watch (most) of the Giro. It just reaffirmed my love for cycling. Fed the obsession, kept it going.  I suppose I have more, but my mind is all over the place. This damn cold has clogged my ears and my concentration is mostly nonexistent. I think I'm supposed to talk about the TdF next. Ahh, yes. My picks.   Well, this is complicated. I pretty much want Vino to win. Something like Vino, Jan, Brad or Vino, Tyler, Brad. Now, I wouldn't be disappointed if Lance won (and, when the tour finally rolls around, I might even be cheering for him, who knows?), but I'm more of a Vino kind of fangirl than Lance. Maybe it's the blond hair and good looks, maybe it's the underdog style of his, or maybe it's fact that he did so much last year with so little help from his team. Whatever it is, Vino is my tour pick for 2004.   And I guess that sums it up for me, for now at least.

      The title of this post doesn't explain anything, I know. Well, it does to me, but that's not really the point. What the title means is what cycling means, or, rather, part of why I love it so much.   I've been sick recently (sick enough to manage only part of a big trance-filled weekend ... My $70 VIP tickets did not, in fact, go to waste. I did get to watch Armin spin. But that's a post for another blog, or something. I'll just push my other obsessions out of here for now.) and so I've managed to miss live coverage on both Thursday (when I slept through most of it) and Friday (out of town). I woke up in time to read the live coverage (somehow I missed that the official  urlLink Giro site  (English version) has live video) on  urlLink cyclingnews , so I knew what was going to happen before  urlLink OLN 's coverage started (not that I don't love OLN, because I adore them. I want to work for them, please. Um. Right, back to point).  So, at four (I was at the store at 3:30) I turned on OLN and settled into bed to watch. Well, even though I knew Gibo hadn't won the stage and Fabian had (thankfully!) managed to win the Maglia verde, it was pretty exciting to watch. The crowds totally blew my mind. I had no idea how close they were to the riders (like Gibo and Damiano). It reminded me, of course, of the TdF. In more ways than one, actually. And the Vuelta, although that was because I managed to miss the live video feed on the Vuelta site as well. But the excitement was similar to the last day when I, being the loyal Baden!girl that I am, followed along at cyclingnews and listed to Bob, Phil, and Paul on OLN and then watched the final stage later in the afternoon.  It was just really fun to watch the race, even though I knew who won. It was really interesting to see all the Italian fans yelling and screaming and getting in the way of both the motor bikes and the cyclists. Scary stuff. But, oh, I'd love to be up there some day.  As for the stage itself? I spent a lot of it hoping Damiano could keep the Maglia rosa without taking away Fabian's Maglia verde. My friend and I spent much of the last parts of the stage trying to figure out how many points Damiano needed and who was in front of him. In the end, though, it worked out perfectly. Although not for Gibo. Three seconds and he would have been second. And then there was all the stuff he said to Damiano the previous day, although Paul or Phil mentioned that he apologized.   I can't imagine that Damiano will stay with Saeco for long, though. Too many top riders on one team and you'll end up like T-Mobile. A team that I love, but a team that pisses me off. I suppose I should explain that, later, though.   Regardless. Tomorrow is all about Petacchi. Although I'm pretty sure I wouldn't complain if, oh, one of the Gerol!boys managed a win. Or even that Brad McGee guy. Right. Nine wins would be amazing, though. I suppose I can't go too wrong tomorrow.

      I've been avoiding posting here. I have so much to talk about and not nearly enough time. Okay, really, once I got behind, I just let it build up. But here I am. Among the many changes I've made, posting my opinions more often is one of them.   Today's opinion is one that really has no feet in reality. And then, at the end, an observation about my favorite team, or lack thereof.  As most of you (are there any of you? do I even care enough? I don't know) probably saw, Brad McGee and the rest of the FDJ team were  urlLink charged a 20-second race penalty  for towing Brad and Matt.   Now, I haven't been a fan of cycling for that long, but one thing that I do know is that Brad McGee isn't one to mince words. He proved that to me the first time I visited his site. But he did it again with his article about doping: " urlLink Looks like we got another 80s Man . "  Now, what I want to know -- as both a fan of cycling and FDJ, is what is going on? Why would Brad lie? To me (it to a lot of people, I assume) it seems if he was guilty, he'd admit it. After all, Gayant admitted he towed Matt (poor boy). But why Brad? He knows he'd surely be caught (and he wasn't the first one), plus, he's trying to prove that he can stay in the top on his own.   Or maybe I just don't like the idea of a cycling boy I love being treated in such a way.  And aren't there tapes? I'm sure the Italian coverage has the incident on tape. But then again, this isn't football, where you can go back and review calls. Although I know sometimes they do it at the finish, like when Robbie McEwen have a few points and some time removed. So maybe they could go clear it up.   But what do I know? I'm just a fan.   And speaking of being a fan. That brings me to the second part of this post. Favorite teams. I used to say that FDJ was my favorite team, but I discovered (with a little help from my friends) that I was wrong. Just like with my favorite cyclists, things changed. For a while it was USPS, then CSC, then FDJ. But, in reality, I don't have a favorite team.   I have favorite riders. I have favorite riders on FDJ, T-Mobile, CSC, QSD, BLB, Gerolsteiner, AG2r, and others. Not to mention the GS II and III teams (Lamonta and Acqua & Sapone for example). I guess that when it comes to team sports, my true loyalties lie with the Ohio State Buckeyes (college American football), the Cleveland Indians (baseball) and the Cleveland Browns (NFL). Although, I'm usually one to root for FDJ.   It's those Australians, really. And Thomas and Phil. And Bernhard. And I could go on, but I won't. Because, my favorite team? All the teams.

      Judging from my location (Michigan) you'd assume that I'd be happy with the results of Stage Nine. Well, you'd be wrong. I'm happy for Freddy (though sad about the other Fredy -- whose crash we saw on tape. Poor guy. At least it appears that he's not too severely injured.), but he is riding for Acqua & Sapone-Caffe Mokambo, which is Gerhard Trampusch's team.   I'm not sure I want to have that rant quite yet (although I did learn a few things about who A&S are working for -- were working for), so I'll save it. Instead I'll talk about my cycling priorities.   As an American, I fell victim to what I've decided to call 'Lance-Syndrome.' What is it? The ability to ignore all other American, much less non-American, riders and think that the Tour de France is the only race. So, the first time I watched the tour, I fell for Lance and USPS. It was easy, since it's US coverage. I didn't like Ullrich (I still don't, but that's yet another topic to be covered) or Vino (oh, how things have changed). I wanted Lance to win.   And then I discovered Tyler. So now it was Lance and Tyler. But as the tour progressed, there were these other riders. Mostly Baden Cooke and David Millar. I've moved on from David, but Baden led me to other things -- other teams and riders. Just to get things straight, I do have a favorite rider (and since I love lists, I'll make on in a second). But none of my top riders are American. And, excluding football and baseball, of my top three remaining sports (cycling, golf, and tennis) two out of three favorites? Aren't American (tennis is the exception, where I am, predictably, a fan of Andy Roddick).   So, what makes an American girl fall in love with European and Australian cyclists?   I wish I knew. Although I suppose a lot of it is superficial. But even deeper than that, there's something about the boys (and yes, I call them boys) that I adore. Their kits, the way they ride. The fact that they don't all speak English. And maybe a lot of it has to do with the fact that they  aren't  American.   I know this post is mostly about me, rather than the stage or the sport. But it helps me to get this stuff out. No tour predictions, well, at least not yet. Anyway.    The Favorites (and yes, the first four are in order)   Matthew Wilson (AUS) Sylvain Chavanel (FRA) Christian Werner (GER) Jurgen Van Goolen (BEL) Frank Høj (DEN) Anthony Geslin (FRA) Gerhard Trampush (AUT) Baden Cooke (AUS) Alexandre Vinokourov (KAZ) Andreas Welsch (GER)  Sure, there are others who I adore, but those are my top favorites. I suppose, eventually I have to make a list of the rest of my favorites, but this is it for now.

      Stage Eight of the Giro D'Italia is over, I know who won (Petacchi, of course) and I'm pleased. But I must confess that, though I don't actually like Cipo, I am sad that this might have been his last race. And that's completely uncharacteristic of me. There are at least five sprinters (oh, so you want names? Just wait.) who I adore more than Cipo.   But I still find it upsetting that he might be leaving. I was trying to figure out why, earlier. And I think that, since I've become enamored with cycling (and I can even tell you the date, if you like), Cipo is the man everyone talks about. Which might be why I shied away from him (and, of course, for very superficial reasons). But then again, there are those five others.   So, perhaps it's just sadness that a big name (like when Johan Museeuw retired just recently) is leaving the peloton. Or maybe I'm just sentimental. Either way, it's sad.  Now, that list.    Sarah's Top Five Sprinters (in no particular order):  Cooke Petacchi Boonen Zabel Foerster*   Next time? I have this rant about Acqua & Sapone-Caffe Mokambo not (visibly) working for Gerhard Trampush. And, oh, there's so much more I could talk about. Like T-Mobile and why I don't care if Lance wins six. But I'll stop for now.   * Robert. As in rides for Gerol.

      Contrary to the subject, this isn't about death. Thought sometimes I feel like I should talk about Pantani's death (or just death in general and society), but not today. I've mentioned before that some of my favorite riders (Vino and Robert Foerster) have crashed recently. This morning, I discovered that yet another of my favorites had an accident. In this case, though, it wasn't during a race.    The following is from  urlLink cyclingnews .   Van Goolen injured Quick.Step-Davitamon's Jurgen Van Goolen was injured while training on his bike Saturday morning. Van Goolen was struck by a motorist who failed to yield, crossing the rider's path and knocking him to the ground. Van Goolen lost consciousness after hitting his head and also suffered injuries to his hands and legs.  Van Goolen remained under observation in the hospital after the accident.   (As a follow-up, on his  urlLink official site , it's been posted that he is out of the hospital and doing okay.)  It was a reminder of how fragile we, as humans really are. But also, how much I take cycling and cyclists for granted. I don't ride on a regular basis (yet) and what races I do get to see are on OLN, so my involvement is, at best, detached from a variety of distances. And it's always stressful to read about (or see, as during the Giro this year) crashes. But when it happens to favorites of mine, it's even more upsetting (and, sometimes, off-putting).   I don't really know what the point of this entry was, maybe just a way for me to, using some sort of written medium, remind myself not to take anything for granted.   I love this sport too much to just not mention things.    Music: DJ MRT (For TAW) - (TranceAirWaves)

      I haven't posted about doping yet and I don't know if I will. Most likely, but we'll just have to wait and see. On to other things, though.  In the comments to the  urlLink entry about Vino  I linked to a CN article  urlLink explaining  why Cadel isn't racing  at the tour this year. Now, my favorite ride is Matt Wilson (who, coincidentally, is going to the tour, along with his FDJ compatriots Brad McGee and Baden Cooke) so I have a soft spot for Aussies. All of the articles I read sort of led me and the rest of the cycling world (and, as it appears, Cadel himself) to believe that he would be at the tour. So, it came as quite a surprise when  urlLink T-Mobile  released their tour team and he was conspicuously absent. My first reaction was, obviously, disbelief. But, upon learning the real  urlLink reason , I grew skeptical.   Now, I honestly have no idea if that's some BS reason to try to explain to the rest of us why they left him off, or if they really do believe they're protecting him. He hasn't fallen yet, which is better than last year. Why not let him go? I have a host of theories, none of which are probably true. But my friend  urlLink April  came up with a better one than any of mine (one of which was the idea that maybe Jan just didn't want Cadel on the team). She suggested that perhaps Cadel and Vino would have been working together for Jan, and thus, without Vino, the whole team would have to be restructured, and that would explain why Cadel was dropped. And I think she's probably right. But I just don't understand why they'd drop him when he's in good form.   Who knows? After all, we both could be wrong. Maybe they really think they're protecting him (though, they'd just have to stop him from racing to  really  protect him).   And, as I told Pam in comments on the  urlLink Matt fansite , let's hope he makes the Olympics team. Otherwise, what a waste of good form.  Either way, I'm going to be rooting for Lance (as tired of him as I may be).

      Is it just me? Am I the only one who doesn't want more coverage of Lance -- or Tyler, Floyd, Freddy, or Levi? Am I the only one who wants more coverage of cycling in general. Of the cyclists I like, not just Americans.   I suppose I should rephrase that. Am I the only  American  who is tired of OLN's coverage of Lance? Okay, I know I'm not. And I know six is a lot and I know that I love my gift-USPS bright yellow t-shirt. But I'm tired of 24/7 Lance. I want variation. I want to hear about other people. Actually, I'm tired of Jan as well. Maybe I've grown too cynical already. But cycling is more than just the tour. It's more than just one race, granted the race last three weeks, but still. It's not the only three week race.   I think I've been holding this in much too long. But someone on  urlLink livejournal  posted a mini-rant about Lance and OLN and it started me thinking. I know I'm rooting for Lance since Vino got hurt and dropped from the tour. But somehow it doesn't feel right. He's not the underdog, he's expected to win. Except that he's not. No one else has done it. But all of this hype. It's overdone. I worry that the hype will be too much and he, like Phil Mickelson and Smarty Jones, like England in Euro 2004, like Coria at the French Open, will just crash out. Perhaps not with a literal crash, but something that will let us (us being Americans? the cycling world? I don't know) down. That will break our hearts. And there will be no broken!Tyler to pull us along. No teamless!Vino to cheer for.   Maybe it'll be Tyler, this time in one piece. Maybe it'll be Roberto or Iban. Or maybe Jan will surprise us all, since his top-heavy team has collapsed (no Cadel, no Vino. please don't get me started on Cadel).   Or maybe I'm wrong. After all, Andy did win the US Open last year. Roger won Wimbledon last year and the Australian Open this year. Juan Carlos won the French Open last year. All were hyped. So maybe Lance will win. Maybe six is his magic number and the Postal team will happily turn into the Discovery Channel team and everyone will be pleased (we're not talking about doping, this post anyway).  But what if he fails? What if he doesn't make it to six? Will he retire? My friend Katie and I used to speculate what would happen. We assumed that, if Lance won, he'd stick with Postal for another year, maybe two. And then, when he retired, Postal would end. And if he lost? He'd retire, again with the dissolving of the Postal team. But now, with the new sponsor, can he retire? If he loses, will he retire? Do I even care?   That last question is the hardest. And I don't know if I care. There are cyclists that I care more about than Lance. But, I suppose, I do want him to win six. I just feel bad rooting against Tyler. But six is six. And next year it'll be harder on me. Vino or Brad. Who knows. But that's next year.

      So may things to talk about, and I'm not going to address most of them. I'll make a list, eventually. But for now, we'll stick two things. By now, the new of Vino's  urlLink crash  and subsequent  urlLink withdrawal  from the 2004 TdF has spread. Today, another of 'my' boys crashed, German Robert Foerster  urlLink abandoned  after a shoulder injury (no word on how serious it is) -- his teammate, Markus Zberg was also seriously injured.   This is not an entry about injuries, I'm not dumb. I know how dangerous cycling is. But I'm not about to pretend I'm not upset. I adore Robert, so that makes me quite sad. But Vino? He was my tour pick.   I know, I know. I'm supposed to pick -- if I'm rooting for T-Mobile -- Jan. But, honestly? I've never liked Jan. Okay, so that's not true. Up until last July I'd never heard of him and even then I didn't not like him, I just wanted him to lose so that Lance could win. But, you know, he started to grow on me. Until (10 Million Euros and a name change later) he went back to his old team.  The team, which my new favorite boy, Vino (and, of course, Erik) rides for. The newly-named T-Mobile. And boy was I pissed. Erik was leader (no more -- at least, not for really big races) and Vino would no longer have his chance at the tour this year. But I didn't falter, I was still all gung-ho Vino '04 (I've had to revise, and now am sticking to Vino '05!).  But I was worried.   Last year, Vino did a lot without a team to back him up. And when Erik won points a few years ago, he did it without a leadout man. Now both men would have to (in most cases, but especially in Vino's) work for Jan. Not something I wanted to see happy to my tour pick.   Maybe I'm selfish, but it just really made me angry. What right did Jan have, coming back to the team he up and left two years earlier? And not only did he make Telekom rename their team, his old team? He completely abandoned them, and they fell apart. I have no sympathy for Jan (although I must confess it's nice to see him doing so well at the Tour de Suisse).   And now Vino's completely out of the tour. So where does that leave me? The loyal Vino!fan?   Well, not rooting for Jan, that's for sure. I was torn between Lance and Tyler. While I'd like to see Tyler win, six would be nice for Lance. And since circumstances have eliminated the man I really wanted to win, I've been  reduced  compelled  to root for Lance. But, honestly, by the tour rolled around, I might have fallen for all the hype and been cheering for him anyway.   So. My podium?   1. Lance 2. Tyler 3. [open]   I have options for third. Jan is okay, Brad would be a dream. Gibo? Perhaps one of the CSC boys. Roberto Heras? Although he's a KOM man, as well.   Sprints? Baden Cooke all the way. Although Robbie, Petacchi, and Stuey will be giving him a run. I'm still picking Baden. How could I not?  Next up? Probably something about the new (and probably crappy) book about Lance and doping (cause I believe that, right).

      I was going to rant about the TdF or T-Mobile, or maybe even BLB and allergies, among other things. But no. Not anymore. I just read the following at  urlLink cyclingnews  and I am just seething.    US champion injured   Multiple US champion Curtis Tolson and the founder of Papa John's pizza chain, John Schnatter, were hospitalised after an accident on Wednesday evening in Louisville, KY, USA. The accident happened when a biology textbook was thrown at the pair from an oncoming pickup truck, reported the Associated Press. Tolson suffered abrasions and possibly a broken collarbone or dislocated shoulder, while Schnatter had abrasions and possible head or back injuries. A third rider who was with them, Tracy Huber, avoided the crash.  Louisville police are investigating the incident as a felony assault. So far, no arrests have been made and there are no suspects.   ---  What is it about this country? Do we have no respect for people? It just pisses me off to no end that people would do such a thing to people on bikes. I used to believe that maybe it was just a fluke, that Americans weren't always so disrepectful toward cyclists. But obviously I was wrong (need I remind you of Clear Channel's advertisements endorsing drivers who wish to run cyclists off the road?).   I am just at a loss. Please, if you drive, respect cyclists. They aren't allowed on sidewalks in most areas and, far too often, cities don't create lanes or bike paths. I am lucky enough to live in a small town (for now) that has enough bike paths (I never thought I'd be grateful to live in Michigan -- not that I ride enough, yet). But, please. A little respect won't hurt.

      This is not the first time I've come across people upset by OLN's coverage. Usually the people I talk to are pissed off because OLN covered too much Lance. That group, of course, includes me. But this time the situation is reversed. I first encountered it on one of cycling communities on  urlLink livejournal  and now (via  urlLink tdfblog ) it seems that a lot of places and people are irritated as well.   What's the problem? People, Americans mostly, are upset that OLN didn't show Lance cross the line at the end of Stage 20 this past Sunday.  My reaction, of course, was to say something like "the sprint was exciting and I'm much rather be watching the sprint then watching Lance cross the line." I then went on to explain that when stage 20 started, we already knew that Lance was going to win and there was no point to showing him cross the line. Plus, the sprint was incredibly exciting and important for the green jersey competition. Also, we should be watching the replays -- why should they change the format (successful format) on the last stage? Just like all previous stages, the only time we ever saw Lance cross the line live was when he won the stage.   I have to confess that I understand why people might get upset, but I don't get why it's such a big deal. Neither does the author of  urlLink TDFblog . Which is why I'm writing this post. I was just going to comment, but it ended up way too long.  Being upset about the lack of Lance crossing the line just doesn't make sense to me. It's like me getting upset because I didn't get to see Matt cross the line live every time -- even though he was almost always at least 10 minutes behind on many of the stages. Sure, it'd be nice to see it, but there were other things (more important things), such as racing, going on. I can honestly say it didn't even cross my mind that we didn't get to see Lance cross the line. I think that's partly because there are cyclists who I like better than Lance, but also because we already knew he won. And why should OLN waste time covering that? Instead we saw the replay of the sprint and then we saw interviews and the trophy presentations. Which, in my opinion, are more important.   But people, even the CEO of OLN, are upset. AP (via  urlLink ESPN )  urlLink reports  that the CEO (Gavin Harvey) said  "I think it was a missed opportunity," he said . Sure it was, but for what? For showing the anti-climatic crossing of the line? To cut away from the real racing of the day? I don't understand what was missed.   But I supposed that most of those 1.37 million viewers watching on Sunday wanted to see Lance and not the actual race.   But, the best thing I took away from that article was what Harvey said about the future of cycling on OLN:  "We are the home of professional cycling on television," he said. "We love the fact that Lance has brought so many eyeballs and attention to the sport of cycling. But it's not just Lance."  It gives me hope that we will keep watching cycling on OLN. I'm not really prepared to give that up without a fight. It's nice to know that OLN isn't fully dependent on Lance for content -- just mostly.  But does it really matter? As long as I get my cycling, I'll grit my teeth through all the (excessive) Lance-coverage.    Music: The Diane Rehm Show

        (cbs sportsline)  The promised post.   Above is German National Champion Andreas Klöden. He's six minutes and thirty eight seconds behind Lance Armstrong and twenty one seconds ahead of Ivan Basso. His place on the podium is second. He was not the leader of T-Mobile, that was Jan Ullrich. But he has developed into something else. Something more than anyone, except perhaps Klöden himself, ever expected. He certainly took the rest of the cycling world -- and his own team -- by surprise.  It's almost funny, because I predicted -- as soon as it was announced that Ullrich was going back to Team Telekom (as it was known then) -- that Ullrich would be beaten by his own team. Of course, my assumptions were based on the inclusion of Cadel Evans and Alexandre Vinokourov on the tour team. As it turned out, Vino crashed and torn the ligaments in his right shoulder. Cadel Evans was left off the team for reasons beyond my understanding (I don't really believe it was 'for his own protection' or so that he could prepare for the Olympics, since he was left off of that team as well). Also missing from the team (due to injury) was former Giro d'Italia winner Paolo Savoldelli - another powerful man whose was supposed to be helping Ullrich. By the start of the tour, the team was composed of most unspectacular people, hopefully those who could support Ullrich in the mountains, flats, and team time trial. What happened was quite unexpected.   Ullrich cracked for whatever reason (perhaps not enough training, perhaps weight problems, perhaps he peaked too soon and it took him too long to get his form back) and his teammate -- Andreas Klöden, instead of helping, sort of took over. Now, Klöden did a lot for Ullrich. He did his domestique duties quite well, until the mountains. He was ahead of Ullrich, but they hadn't reached the mountains yet. And even into the beginnings of the Pyrenees, Klöden rode up with Ullrich and Lance. Then, on Stage ten, Klöden came in second -- five minutes and nineteen seconds behind Virenque. The result was not even considered that important, except as a passing mention of Klöden's improving form.   Stage eleven was mostly uneventful for Klöden, he attacked, but ended up 20th, behind the big sprinters. Then, seemingly out of nowhere and as his team leader was cracking, Klöden followed Basso and Lance up to the top of La Mongie. Instead of pacing Ullrich to keep up, Klöden crossed the line in third, 20 seconds behind Basso and Lance. This catapulted Klöden up the classifications, and even further above Ullrich. Eventually they all gained more time. Ullrich slowly caught up to Klöden, but never quite had enough to pass him. In the end, Klöden was just too strong.  Now,  urlLink April  believes that since Ullrich didn't make the podium, he'll probably seek out a new team -- or Klöden will go somewhere else. Personally, I believe the latter. I think Klöden won't be riding for T-Mobile next year. Why? Because, although he spent a lot of time helping Ullrich, it was clear he wanted to win the tour. The different between T-Mobile and USPS was teamwork. I believe Jose Azevedo could win the tour, and may someday, but he dedicated himself to helping Lance. And what happened? He's fifth overall and Lance is on his way to six. Klöden, it seems, wasn't satisfied with his team leader's performance and decided to take advantage of the great form he was riding into. And it paid off.  But he didn't do what the team wanted and Ullrich suffered. The fact that he focused on his own ambitions instead of his team's, and because he almost caught Ullrich on the time trial today, I believe that he'll be seeking a new team next year. It's obvious that he's turned his career around, at least for now. I think we can expect big things from Klöden -- the rest of this year and next as well.  As for Ullrich? He's still got a few more tours in him. And I firmly believe he'll be riding in T-Mobile colors for at least one more year. Maybe next year they'll pick the right domestiques. It's quite possible that this year will have made him mad enough to focus him into winning in 2005. Regardless, next year will prove to be just as exciting.

      According to  urlLink procycling , the cause of Iban Mayo's poor performance in the Pyrenees? "[A] stress-induced mental block." It was what everyone had guessed, and today, well, it took it's final toll for the tour. Mayo didn't start the stage, along with Jakob Piil, who left yesterday.   CN and  Reuters  reported that Euskaltel team manager Miguel Madariaga said "We knew he wouldn't finish the stage today, so we decided it was better for him not to start." It's hard to tell if Mayo even had any say in the decision, but I'm betting he did. So, is it better not to start than to abandon? Either way you're not finishing the race, one way just saves embarrassment.  ---  Yesterday I mentioned that Matthew White was on the Australian Olympic team and I was worried that he wouldn't be able to make the team. Well, CN apparently has started reading my mind, because they reported that Matt is up and riding again.    Matthew White (Cofidis), who crashed before the prologue in Liege and didn't take the start of the Tour, is now on the mend after breaking his right collarbone. White also suffered facial wounds and had to get four stitches to his eyebrow. However, he has resumed training on the road and is expected to start racing again at the end of July in preparation for the Olympic Games in Athens.  ( urlLink cyclingnews )  ---  Although Richard Virenque didn't win today's stage (no amount of my shouting could change that, sadly), his win on Bastille Day and invitation to the Olympics might have changed his mind about retiring.  urlLink procycling  reports that Virenque might extend his QSD contract. Personally, I'd like to see him try for an eighth(yes, I think he'll win seven without any problems) KOM jersey and then retire. A nice round number that will take years to overcome. Or maybe I just like records.   ---  Quote of the day:    "I gave it everything today," the young Frenchman said at the finish. "As things got harder, there was nothing I could do &#150; Armstrong was too strong. But I don&#146;t feel disappointed about losing the yellow jersey," continued Voeckler. "I held it a long time, and I was happy to be wearing it. I have no regrets &#150; it&#146;s been a positive experience for me."  ( urlLink procycling )   And now he's after the white jersey. I hope he keeps it.   ---  Tomorrow:  The  urlLink Sachsen Tour International  starts.   PS. OLN? Ivan Basso is 26. He'll be 27 in November. 11.26.77 to be exact.

      Olympic teams: Baden, Brad and Mark are all going. Sylvain and Thomas (and Richard!) are going. Lance is not, but Levi is. Matt (White) - status unknown. I hope he's healed enough (he should be). I hope Tyler's healed enough as well. I hope NBC covers cycling on the channels I get (those I don't get being Telemundo and NBCHD). Thomas Dekker (a favorite of  urlLink April 's) beat out Erik Dekker (they aren't related) for the Dutch TT at the Olympics -- although Erik is riding the road race. It should be a lot of fun.  Doping: Man, it never stops. I suppose it will never really spot, anyway. Sean Eadie's considering legal action. ASO and Lance aren't speaking. Hinault "is not impressed with Greg LeMond's insinuations that Lance Armstrong has achieved his five Tour victories with a little help" ( urlLink cyclingnews ). What next? I don't know, but I suppose it does keep people on their toes.  Articles: There is just something inspiring and hopeful about cyclingnews' story " urlLink A victory of another kind for Euskaltel-Euskadi ." Some teams still have that something, even when they're down and out. And it's especially nice to be able to understand -- at least to the extent that  he  understands -- what's going on with Iban Mayo.  Amusement: As always, the  urlLink Daily Peloton  provides some good (and entertaining) reading. Tick translated  urlLink Nobody Loves Me  by Ploner. It's an amusing take on the tour jerseys.   Eventually I'll have real content back -- probably when the tour is over. Until then, you just get this random collection of things. The TdF diary has my coherent set of opinions.   Oh, and by the way? Thomas Voeckler is still 25. Even  urlLink Le Tour  agrees.     Music: Kenneth Thomas - Live at Club Bleu with DJ Tiesto - 06.24.04 (Trancepshere)

      I feel like the saga of Jan Ullrich's 2004 tour should be called 'oh, the places you won't go.' My little take off on the Dr. Seuss book,  urlLink Oh,   the Places You'll Go! , not that that wasn't at all obvious. It just seems that the only place he's going is backward in time, so to speak. He just keeps losing time, yet going up in the classification. It's all beyond me. I think he looks pretty bad, but he's still riding strong. I'm not the only one who wonders what's wrong either. The  procycling  article,  urlLink T-Mobile perplexed by Ullrich , has quotes from T-Mobile manager, Walter Godefroot. He essentially says that he has no idea what's going on with Ullrich.   He [Ullrich] hasn't really talked to the rest of the team. They'd hoped that today's stage (13) would have been good. But while it was better than yesterday, it wasn't at all what they'd expected. What do I think? The dramatic weight loss he experienced (during the Tour de Suisse? Correct me if I'm wrong, please.) took a negative toll on his body.   Non-tour talk.  So. My boys that aren't racing the tour? Most of them will be racing at the Sachsen-Tour International.  urlLink Cycling startlists  has the complete  urlLink startlist  (PDF) for the race. Included (of "my" boys) are Christian Werner (T-Mobile), Frank Hoj (CSC), Mads Kaggestad (Crédit Agriole), and Björn Glasner, David Kopp, and Phillip Mamos (Lamonta). The Saschesen-Tour is from July 21-25th ( urlLink official site ).  According to  urlLink Cycling startlists , both Jurgen van Goolen and Alexandre Vinokourov will be back racing at the  urlLink Tour de la Région Wallonne . Cadel Evans, who I believe should be at the tour right now -- and part of the reason Jan's not doing that well, will be racing.  	Philippe Gilbert of FDJ will be there as well. The race is July 26-30th ( urlLink official site ).  It'll be nice to have other racing to follow as well. Not that I'm tired of the tour (I'm not, because I love to watch live cycling -- even if it's only on my TV). But I miss following my other favorites.

      I know I complain about the hype surrounding Lance. But I'm about to succumb, in a way, to it. So, in the  urlLink diary  I talk a lot about Thomas Voeckler and not so much about Lance. I've confessed that I want Thomas to go all the way, but that I don't think he's going to do it (this year). I've also stated that I would be just as happy if Lance were to win six (record breaking and all that). I can't predict if I'd be sad if he lost, but I'm betting I would be.   I'm a pretty loyal fan, once I get settled. And I've never spent much time thinking about if Lance -- or any of my favorite athletes -- doped. And, honestly, I don't really want to know. Maybe if they changed the rules around (let everyone dope -- it's their own life -- or tested every three months [neither of those ideas are mine, they're  urlLink April 's and I've come to agree with her]) I'd feel differently. But right now, I don't want to know. I didn't want to know that David did, or that Baden might have (I still believe that Baden didn't).  But that's not the point of this. The point is that reporters (and others) like to go after people. I know David's case was different. There was actual doping evidence (I believe) of former Cofidis riders doping and then, eventually, he came forward. But most of this stuff has been in the past (even David's, really), until now with Lance (and the riders that tested positive before and during the tour). What I'm really writing about is Lance.   I've read both books, I believe that he didn't -- doesn't. But who am I to know? No one. I'm just a cycling fan in the middle of Michigan. The only person who really knows is Lance and he says he didn't. He's only failed one test and that was several years ago. Who are we to go against his word? And if it turns out later that he was, how do we know that everyone isn't using stuff? We don't know. And I'm beginning to think that it's just a witch hunt. Maybe the French press don't want Lance to win. Maybe they really do believe he's doping. Maybe the UCI and ASO think they're making a difference by cracking down on people.   I don't know. And I don't really care. They can keep doing what they want and people will keep riding. And, honestly, people will keep doping. That's just the way things go. You don't feel your good enough, you take something and you might do better. If that doesn't work? You try something else.  urlLink April  spent a lot of time talking about this when David confessed. When I was telling her how devastated I'd be if Matt said he was taking something. But I've, for the most part, gotten over that. I might feel betrayed, but people come back. Just look at Richard Virenque. It's not the end of the world.  As for Greg LeMond's comments? Part of me thinks he knows something, part of me thinks he's just making trouble, and most of me thinks he's bitter. He used to be the named in US cycling (and, really, I think he is in a lot of circles) but no one is like Lance. There's no real superstar. And that's what Lance is. Not just here, but in other countries as well. And in the states? If you know nothing about cycling, you know Lance. He's "that guy with cancer who rides the bike." Hell, that's all I knew about him (and that he had a book with a cool title) just over a year ago.   Oh, how things change.   But whatever the motive is, people will keep searching for scapegoats. They'll keep doping. And they'll keep racing. That's just the way things work. I wish we could just get over it and be thankful that people have stopped riding drunk.

         The yellow bracelets/bands finally came in the mail today. If you don't have one, you should  urlLink buy them  for yourself and others. That being said, I'm going to take a moment to explain why I am wearing one.  ---  I wear yellow because my grandfather died of cancer. Because my grandmother survived breast cancer.

I wear yellow because someday we will be cancer. I wear yellow because I  live strong.  "Yellow wakes me up in the morning. Yellow gets me on the bike every day.

      I was going to post this last night, but the UCI site crashed Firefox. And then I thought I'd post it this morning, but I sort of slept through the Pre-Race show (when I do my usual early morning updates). So here it is.  I do a lot of reading of online cycling news sites. They have pretty good coverage, with a wide variety of views, among other things. But something they all have in common is the inability to state, correctly and consistently, what Thomas Voeckler's age is.   I have read that he's 23, 24 or 25. Which, obviously, means he's between the ages of 23-25. You'd think that someone would have looked this up, but, alas, it appears most people haven't. Some sites even have conflicting articles, where his age is listed differently every time.   So I've decided to clear this up once and for all. After all, he is wearing the yellow jersey.  So? What is his age? Well, I first went to the  urlLink UCI website . And, after finally getting it to work in Opera, I navigated until I found the listing of riders on  urlLink Brioches La Boulangere .    FRA19790622 VOECKLER Thomas   Not that I don't trust the UCI, but I figured I'd better get another source. So I went to the official  urlLink BLB  website. I headed over to their bio section on  urlLink Thomas  and what did I find?    22 juin 1979   After some quick (and easy -- he's a year and a few months younger than I am) math, I determined that the actual age of Thomas Voeckler is 25 years.   Nice to know, isn't it? I thought so. Good luck on Stage 10 tomorrow, Thomas!   Music: Jason Mraz - Water

      On this rest day -- well, not really, because this stuff happened (well the tour-related stuff) yesterday and the day before -- people are whining -- well, mostly speaking their minds rather publicly. It's not nearly as amusing as  urlLink Simoni , though. Actually, it's kind of odd.   First there's Mark French's family. Now, I don't blame them -- after all their son (cousin, nephew) is only 19. But I'm not sure their  urlLink letters  will help his case any (scroll down to "French saga rumbles on"). The poor kid (if his story is to be believed, I've read conflicting views on this) confessed and has tried to take a lot of people down with him. No one is sure how much of it is true, but still. Except maybe all of the evidence in the open will clear things up? I'm tired of it, although I contradict my own statement by the fact that I keep writing about it. I'm not sure what I think. On one had I feel bad for Mark -- like I feel bad for David, etc -- but on the other hand, he (they) did dope. It's not that I can't feel bad for them, it's that I don't know what the punishment should be -- though I believe French has been banned from a lot of stuff for life.  Or maybe they should just make doping legal and let everyone take their own risks and, potentially, get sick and/or die. I don't know.  Right. I think I lost my train of thought. People on AIM are distracting me. Next up, clash of the  titans  sprinters: Robbie v. Rene.  I'll sum up: Rene crashed. Robbie blames Rene, and says Rene did the same thing last year (to both Robbie and Baden). Robbie falls and is hurt (Baden is fine). Rene is (seriously) hurt, Robbie yells at him. Rene gets pissed. Robbie is pissed. They fight. Oh, wait. I made that last bit up. Lots of nasty words exchanged. I wish people would just get over it and move on, but it seem neither  urlLink Robbie or Rene  can.    And we don't really know what happened. The amateur video footage shows the aftermath of Rene's crash. Bob claimed that it couldn't have been Rene's fault because he crashed into the barriers after he feel (or something similar -- correct me if I'm wrong). Rene says it's not his fault -- that his handlebars snapped in two and he was flung off of his bike and into the barrier. Robbie says that Rene was riding to fast and his the barrier, Floyd Landis pretty much says the same thing and "don't sprint for 35th place."   I hope everyone feels better now that they got that out.   Maybe Robbie's just bitter that he didn't get the green jersey that day. But I don't know. The video doesn't really show. Mostly it's the big gap between Flecha and the riders in front of him because he was going slow, then the peloton is slowing down because Rene crashed. Then the camera pans over and there are two (I think) Saeco riders that ride/crash over Rene, but we don't really see what happened to Rene, except that there's no one around him until those Saeco riders -- a few seconds later. So, we don't really know. I would bet that most of the riders don't, either.  I have to say, though, that the most impressive thing was watching Thomas ride through the crash and not fall. The yellow jersey just slipped right through -- lucky for him. I was worried.   Crashes are upsetting and there seem to be more than last year. But, according most things I've heard and read, this happens every few years. I don't know if they should change the rules like  urlLink Bjarne Riis  wants or if they should just let it be. Who knows. Certainly not me.  EDIT: Because, you know, it's kind of like a train wreck.

      Among the many sports I like, the Olympic Games tends to be near the top every two years (winter or summer, I'm not that picky). But, for me, things have changed a bit. Even though Matt's not racing for Australia (although I don't know if they're going to replace Matt White or if four weeks is enough time for him to recover from the broken collarbone), Baden, Mark (Renshaw) and Brad are racing. So, most likely, I'll be an Aussie!fangirl. Not that I'm not rooting for the US, because I will be.   But it seems Lance has decided that he doesn't want to go to the Olympics (although Phil and Paul are certain he's going to change his mind, especially if his form is still good after the tour). An article posted at  urlLink TDF Blog  is titled  urlLink Armstrong's Athens avoidance to annoy audience?  and brings up the idea that we won't get more than a few seconds worth of cycling coverage.   Well, I don't hold out much hope, but NBC owns a lot of stations and it seems most of them will be covering the Olympics. Now, in previous years we got a few different sports, but mostly stuff that most people would care about. But, things seem to be different this year. Why? I don't know. But at the  urlLink NBC Olympics  site, they claim they're doing "unprecedented 24-hours-per-day broadcast." So what does that mean? That we'll hopefully be able to see everything we want to see, like, oh, cycling.   The 24-hour broadcast info can be found  urlLink here . They don't have a schedule for the games yet (probably because there isn't one), but there it is. Probably not as good as when my parents lived in Upstate New York and watched Canadian coverage of the Olympics in Canada, but hopefully close. I really want to see cycling.  And I should go watch the rest of the stage, now.   Music: Stage Eight on OLN

      So, poor Rene wasn't the complete cause of the pile-up with 1km to go. Although Gibo did run him over. Possibly why he has three (9th, 10th, and 11th) broken ribs. But it was the speed of the peloton chasing after Juan Antonio Flecha and slow riders (I'm pretty sure it was Gibo running over Rene and people trying not to hit them) that caused the crash. OLN's (rather unexciting) pre-race show just showed a slow-motion replay. After talking to the completely adorable Tom Boonen.   Other things. Baden write in his  urlLink Stage Five  diary that "my morale is low but my ambitions are still high." What I want to know is how this is really affecting the whole team. This being the loss of Brad. So far three FDJeuxers (Bernhard, Sandy and Carlos) have gone in breakaways and I'm sure there'll be more. Well, I hope there will be more. The team really needs to figure out how to get it together. Some of us think that Baden's not completely out of the running for the green jersey. Although Baden himself thinks that  urlLink he's out of contention . Which is sad, but hey, you never know. He needs to start winning, though.  Commercials. I know that I'm not the only one who finds those damn cyclysm commercials annoying. And I don't know, but OLN really seems to need a better set of commercials because these are getting old. Although I complete love (as it  is  my favorite commercial ever, followed closely by the British Airways one that was shown during Wimbledon this year) the  urlLink See Lance Ride  Nike commercial. I also like the Posties delivering mail, but is it just me or are there only two or three actual USPS riders in the commercial? And, of course, I like the commercials with Bob Roll pretending to be in last year's tour (except for the tacked on Lance bit). But mostly I'm ready for some new ones.  7 minutes! I'm ready for race coverage already.   Pre-Race note: Bob. What the hell? "Woman's prerogative and drafting are related? ..."  I'm glad you find it funny because I'm confused.

      I'm the kind of girl who gets obsessions. Sure, I've done the whole actor thing. Movies, bands, books, everything.  I loved Leonardo DiCaprio in high school, Dave Matthews Band throughout college. I've been through  Lord of the Rings  and  Harry Potter , among others. But the one constant has been sports. I've always loved sports, I tried to play (t-ball, softball, soccer, gymnastics) but it hurt my feet (I had bunions -- I had surgery to remove them in 2002) so I never got very far. But I became a very good fan, mostly of baseball, basketball and football.   I've held onto both baseball and football, but basketball never really held my interest. I grew up loving teams from Ohio (pro - Cleveland and college - Ohio State) because my father did (and still does). When I went to college, I was in marching band and went to all the home football games (and one or two away ones) and my dorm room was right off the practice field for soccer. Sports has never been far from my life.  And that brings me back to this sport, cycling.   There are others I like, baseball and football of course. But also tennis and golf (with a few others mixed in). But nothing, not one thing, compares to my love for cycling. It is an obsession for me. And while that might freak people out, it's just part of who I am. I am not extremely OCD (or the Matt site would be updated as soon as the full results were posted, and it never is). But I love cycling, more than most things. I like say that I love cycling more than everything else, except maybe Armin van Buuren, but I know I'm wrong.   Armin is a close second to cycling (probably followed by the music of Jason Mraz and Sondre Lerche, then college football). But cycling is by far the one thing in my life that I stop doing stuff for. It is what I want to spend my life doing.   Throughout high school and college, I've always struggled with what I wanted to do with my life. While other kids wanted to teach or work in the business world, I would make up stuff just so people would stop asking me. Nothing ever really grabbed me (and that's part of why I'm still unemployed right now) until I found cycling. And it wasn't even until I started that Matt site that I realized that cycling was it. It was the thing I'd been looking for.   And so I made it my goal that I wanted to write about it. But, as I'm prone to do, I let a lot of people down along the way. I made them promises and broke them, said I'd email people and then didn't. But I started writing, with this blog. Nothing big and nothing on a regular basis. And then the tour happened again (as it's prone to do) and that's when I figured out that I had to do something.   And finally, after nearly six months of wishing it, I have.   I suppose the real point of this is that I sometimes forget that there are other people in the world who love cycling. I forget that I'm not the only person out there. And when I'm reminded, it takes me a while to get over myself. To realize how wonderful it is that I'm not the only one, after all. And it takes me time to realize that sharing is okay. That it's fine that other people have the same favorite cyclists as I. That it's okay that people have different opinions than I do. That it's all right if someone wants Jan or Tyler to win, while I'm dissing Lance and, at the same time, hoping he wins. I forget that I can't and shouldn't have it my way. And when I remember that, everything is okay. Everything makes sense.   And, I guess what I'm really trying to say is that, to me, I am cycling. It is an obsession, but it's turned into my life. When I talk about myself, the first thing I say is that I love cycling, that I want to spend the rest of my life writing about it, watching it, whatever. I want to be immersed in it. It's almost been a year since I first watched tour. Since the 'cycling bug' bit me. And I've come so far. I'm not there yet, but I will be. Cycling is my life and that's just how I want it. It's who I've become. And that makes me happy.   Music: Lance Nike Ad MP3

      1. Benjamin Noval.  Didn't make it across the line with the rest of Postal, in fact, when he did cross the line (thankfully before the cut) he was in tears. What happened? Well, OLN just showed us (because sometimes their devotion to USPS pays off). The team, including Lance, did their best to comfort Noval. It was pretty impressive. Just more evidence that cycling is a team sport.  Not that I ever doubted it. Just look at FDJ, especially the Aussies.  2. Jesus Manzano. Well, it turns out I was right. The following is from  urlLink cyclingnews .   Manzano pops up  Amore e Vita rider Jesus Manzano is alive and well, according to Europa Press. Manzano, whose team manager expressed concern about his whereabouts on Tuesday after the former Kelme rider had not been in touch with the team for some time, said the only problem he was having was that he'd been a bit downcast recently as a result of the intense media pressure he'd been under.  Manzano blew up a storm of controversy earlier this year when he alleged he had been subjected to institutionalized doping practices while at Kelme.  He said he'd fled reporters who had been at his house every day looking for interviews, and was concentrating on getting treatment for the knee problem that has prevented him from riding this year. However, he was not optimistic that the treatment would allow him to return to competition, though he did expect to return to a "normal life."  As for the visit to a clinic which his team manager believed was for treatment for depression, Manzano said the cause was actually a rather happier one - his girlfriend Marina is pregnant.   He ran, like I figured. In a way I feel sorry for him (especially after the stories of Pantani), but he brought this upon himself, so the sympathy is muted.   3. Thomas Dekker - otherwise known as young gun at the Olympics.  One of April's favorites is the Rabobank T3 rider Thomas Dekker (I am partial to Bas Giling myself). He won the elite men time trial at the Dutch National Championships about a week and a half ago.  urlLink Cyclingnews  reported that he beat out "his more experienced elder namesake Erik Dekker." It just makes me happy when the young guys ride so well that they can get picked.   As for the Olympics? I'm not sure who I'm rooting for, since Matt (Wilson) wasn't chosen. Although Brad, Mark and Baden all were. But who knows, since Matt White fell before the tour and ended up with a broken collarbone. Maybe I'll, gasp, root for the US. Who knows? I just hope that NBC (with all it's affiliate stations) chooses to show cycling. Not just the time trial and the road race, I'd like track, too. We'll see. It certainly won't be like the Salt Lake City Olympics.   It's almost time for the stage, then I'll get to finishing up that diary page. I've got so much tour opinions to share.

      The team time trial was not what I expected. Not necessarily the teams themselves (except where the hell is FDJ -- oh. 21st. Or, you know, last.) but all the crashes. Anyway, this is not at all what I wanted to write about.   In the diary entries, of which I am behind by two stages and weblog-less for the moment, I talked about poor Brad. Well, I just finally got around to reading his diary entries at  urlLink his site  and he's apparently hurt himself doing some  urlLink heavy lifting . Which might explain yesterday and today's stage results for FDJ (don't worry Matt, I'm not giving up hope). But it's really disheartening to read how much Brad wanted to be in yellow and then find out how much crap has happened.   Other things. I feel bad for David Millar, all this doping stuff he got himself into has just  urlLink knocked him down . I expect Cofidis will kick him off, if they haven't already. It's too bad, disappointing too. Maybe he'll be able to overcome all of this. At least I hope he can.  I want to write the headline "Key Cyclist in Doping Scandal Missing," but it seems  urlLink Procycling  went for the more standard headline, less exciting as it were:  urlLink Fears for whereabouts of Manzano . In a very loose and non-doping sense, it makes me think of  Les Triplettes de Belleville  (someday I'll own that movie). But, honestly, I hope nothing serious has happened. Not that I should speculate, but maybe he just got tired and ran off. Although the following is kind of worrisome:   "The only other vague piece of information Fanini revealed about Manzano's recent movements was that the former Kelme rider had called Amore e Vita directeur sportif Roberto Pelliconi in tears after leaving a Spanish hospital where he had apparently been told he would never be able to cycle competitively again. Describing Manzano's mood as "depressed", Fanini explained: "He disappeared then without leaving any trace of where he was going."   I don't even know why I care, after all the stir he's caused. It's just kind of sad to watch cyclists slide downhill so far. Like Mark French and, in a way, Pantani. Although we'll never really know if Pantani doped while riding. It's all so sad.   As are the deaths overshadowed by doping recently. Just as a small reminder: Jean Graczyk, Charly Grosskost and Stive Vermaut all died near the end of June. Stive was only 28, though retired from cycling. Robbie dedicated his stage win to the memory of Stive, a former teammate of his. Graczyk died at 71. Grosskost, 60, was hit by a car while riding.   Just a quiet moment of reflection, we are all human after all.   Music: DJ Percision live on Tranceairwaves

      I did, in fact, get to watch the first three stages of the tour while I was away (as well as the Wimbledon finals, but I'm not talking about that). --- I have a lot of things I want to say, catch up on. One of these things is a TdF diary of my own that I need to work on. But that's all for later. What I want to talk about today is the fact that this is, to me, totally different from last year.  Granted, I didn't start watching the tour until Stage 12, but by that time the team that would be my favorite by the end of 2003 (FDJ) had already done so well (although they'd lost Matt) by then. With Baden having worn the green and the white jerseys and Brad was in yellow (though only temporarily). And this year? Not so much.   Although both Matt (on his  urlLink official site ) and Baden (in his  urlLink bike.com  diary) have mentioned that things will improve, it still makes me sad. Most of the Australians have had problems this tour. Which shouldn't surprise me so much, because that's how the tour goes. But, perhaps, Tyler spoiled me by doing so well last year after his crash. Or maybe I'm just lacking in faith right now. Well, maybe faith isn't the right word, because I'm still convinced they'll all come through.   But, how else is it different for me? So many big names on the front, both overall and in the sprints. By the time I figured out what I wanted to pay attention to, Cipo hadn't been invited and Petacchi had dropped out so it was, really, just Baden and Robbie. I didn't know anyone else, really. Now I'm familiar with all the sprinters (and I, along with  urlLink April  are fans of Thor and Tom (along with Baden and Petacchi, among others) and so it's a lot more intense.   As for overall? It was great to see Fabian in yellow, the same with Thor. But yesteday's stage over the cobbles really blew my mind. Not really because of the cobbles, as I'd watched Paris-Roubaix this year, but just how hard USPS pushed and then the crashes. Just surprising, really.   I'm just happy I've settled on Lance for my overall. The rest can fall wherever, although I wouldn't complain if Tyler came in second this year.  There's team time trailing on my TV so I'm off to watch that.    Music: 2004 Tour de France on OLN

      As the tour is starting and Wimbledon is ending, I am leaving town. I will, hopefully, be watching at least the first two stages live.   I'll definitely be writing more throughout the tour.    Music: NPR - Morning Edition

      Update on the David Millar story.  According to  urlLink Procycling , he hasn't been stripped of the world champion jersey -- yet. That's only something the UCI can do. Also, they printed the "full statement from British Cycling," which includes the following list of sanctions.  * A two-year suspension from competition from 5 August 2004 until 4 August 2006 * A fine of 2,000 Swiss francs. * Disqualification from the 2003 World Elite Time Trial Championship * Disqualification from the 2003 Dauphine Libéré Stage Race * Disqualification from the 2001 Tour of Spain. And, "David Millar has no right of appeal to British Cycling, but may appeal to the Court for Arbitration in Sport."   It's not just two years, it's two years plus a bunch of stuff.

      Does David Millar deserve more than two years? Should he have been banned from cycling forever? Or maybe just for a few months? After all, Virenque lied and everyone knew he was lying, yet he was only banned for eight months.   Millar's case, along with that of Cofidis, are perhaps the most high-profile in recent years. There was a fear that because Millar was so well-known and well-liked by other cyclists, he would be used to set an example. The British Cycling Federation, among others, obviously felt that two years would suffice. We will probably never know the exact details, but maybe they decided that his confession, along with the stripping of his world title and firing from Cofidis were punishment enough. Or maybe the subsequent interviews (see links below) where he finally told his story to the public, gave him a softer side.   Two years is a long time. He'll miss (including this year) a total of three world championship races, three tours, three Vueltas, and the Olympics. But maybe his banning will have a positive effect. Even though it's two years, he can still change the way young riders think about doping. Because he is so well-known, people will listen to him.  "I made mistakes and am ready to learn. I'd like to explain the dangers to young riders." ( urlLink bbc )  Then again, two years isn't so long. He's a fit rider, and just because he's not racing doesn't mean he can't ride his bike. If he's lucky, someone (perhaps even the team that offered him a contract already) will still be willing to take him. He'll train and show the world that he can come back. Two years from now, he'll be back racing. And then, perhaps four years from now, he'll be preparing for the Olympics again.   Maybe what cycling needs is proof that punishment works. Millar's been fired from his team, had his title stripped, and lost his chance for gold. He's been to the bottom, he's there now. And he's telling the world what it's like. Maybe this time people will finally pay attention.  >  urlLink The wrong gear  ( urlLink Guardian Unlimited ) >  urlLink Millar's tale of woe is made all the sadder by his natural talent  ( urlLink Guardian Unlimited )   Music: John Digweed - MMII (RaveTrax.com)

      I try hard to be objective. I try to keep my personal bias tucked away -- at least, I like to think I do. And then I find myself getting all worked up about one of my favorites (Sylvain Chavanel and his potential transfer to QSD, Phonak or Discovery) and wonder whatever happened to my desire to be unbiased. I get into an argument with a friend over why Sylvain shouldn't go to Discovery and then I start to wonder. Am I really thinking about why Sylvain shouldn't go or my own desire for him not to go?  It's a distinction that I find hard to make sometimes. I have always, and will always, have favorites. Cyclists (golfers, tennis players, baseball players, football players -- American) that I like more than the rest. To me, they deserve better. They should win more races/stages; their teams should work for them and not the other way around. I don't necessarily realize that I'm feeling instead of actually coming up with anything intelligent to say.   Probably the biggest example (aside from the Sylvain situation) relates to T-Mobile, back when they were Telekom. Quite soon after the '03 tour, Jan Ullrich announced he was going back to Telekom. I was incensed. How dare he invade Vino's team, take the captain duties from Zabel, and so on. It was only later that I formed other opinions, based on facts and not on emotions.  I was pissed off because I like Alexandre Vinokourov and Erik Zabel, I didn’t want Ullrich ruining their tour chances. About a year later, I still believe that Ullrich shouldn't have returned to T-Mobile, but my reasons are different. He left his former team, Bianchi, in ruins. A lot of money was spent on Ullrich, yet he didn't give T-Mobile what they wanted -- a tour win or a second place on the podium. The team, as I'd predicted, was top heavy. Of course, neither Vino nor Zabel were the cause.   The point, though, is that I am prone to think with my heart. I always look to see where my boys are placed and only after, who won the race. I'm trying to change, but it's harder than I expected. Why? Because I care. Not that other people who write about cycling don't care, it's just that the way I care is so much deeper than just a superficial love.  There are some sports where it's okay for me to care deeply, because I have no need to be objective. Golf is probably the most obvious example. I adore certain golfers (Freddy Jacobson, Aaron Baddeley, and Bill Haas for example) and when they don't do well, I don't necessarily pay close attention to the rest of the tournaments. But with cycling, I cannot afford that luxury. If I want to write about cycling, I need to be objective. I need to see beyond my favorites. I need to be able to separate myself from the people and concentrate on the sport.  Unless someone knows how I can incorporate my bias into my writing and make it work for me.  Until then, I'll fume to myself about my specific trade rumors and transfers. There are, after all, other riders besides Sylvain Chavanel.   Music: Niklas Harding pres.
