      Assuming that only people I know will ever read this, I might just as well skip this section- but I like talking about myself way too much to leave it!  &nbsp; My name's 'Simone'- I have recently been told by some French fellow that it's a terribly old-fashioned name in France and I should at least be 80 to get away with it, but&nbsp;my Dad liked it so I am named for an assortmend of long-dead French ladies like "Simone de Beauvoir" etc. Incidentally my Dad's like&nbsp;for France didn't stop there, so he also named me 'Cecille' and 'Dominique'.  &nbsp; I was born on the 9th of November 1979 in Wuppertal, Germany&nbsp;at 8.20 am. It was the last time in my life I got up early to do something!  &nbsp; Two months later my parents moved to Ommersheim, Germany, which is in&nbsp;the Saarland. The Saar area briefly became more or less famous after the Great War but ever since has remained in obscurity- I intend to change that! Not that I am particularly patriotic but I like the idea that my being alone will help the place where I spent 18 years of&nbsp;my life to some sort of fame.  &nbsp; Like pretty much all children from that area I went to school (wow!), nothing strange there! But aged 18 my life changed rather drastically when I moved straight from my parents' house to London where I remained for the next four years, doing an assortment of&nbsp;more or less useful courses and degrees at the London School of Economics (LSE).  &nbsp; I now have a BA in Law and Anthropology, an MSc in Nationalism and Ethnicity and am doing my PhD in Anthropology. Mind you, in Brighton these days! However, part of the reason why I'm writing this- no, it's not only because I like talking about myself- is that I have to move to Frankfurt a.M. in Germany come October to do my fieldwork.  &nbsp; My research centres upon national identity and post-national citizenship amongst young Korean women in Germany. Why? Easy- my Mom (aka The Mother of all Philosophers) is Korean and I've always found&nbsp;the Korean German&nbsp;connection interesting - and yes, I like talking about myself!  &nbsp; Mom or the Mother of all Philosophers hasn't given me any strange names but a lot of useful advice on life, the universe and everything. A much-loved and quoted classic is her early-morning phonecall to me one fine day to tell me that I should do sports in order to remain flexible. Why? Her reasoning was that I wouldn't stay single forever and therefore would need to be 'bendable' again at one point or another.&nbsp; I never&nbsp;could quite bring myself to ask her what exactly she envisaged me doing and maintain that I do not want to know!  &nbsp; What else does one need to know to understand any of these ramblings?  &nbsp; I think that's pretty much it. All else will either be self-explanatory or explained at appropriate points within the narrative! &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I mean, it's not like anyone is particularly interested in what I have to say or observe about life, since most of it rather directly relates to my own life, but why not? At least it'll give my flatmate yet another opportunity to call me a 'geek' and doing this is a bit like going on Ricki Lake anyway- baring my soul to the entire disinterested world.  &nbsp;  Granted, I reckon the world would be interested, if I started shouting randomly at people as though I were in Jerry Springer, participating in one of those ludicrously complicated stories in which one's mother has stolen one's boyfriend who then turns out to be gay and has an affair with your younger brother after having impregnated your younger sister, who by the way is not your sister but the baby you had when you were thirteen and that your mother graciously took on as her own to spare you from the shame... grand and then you go on Jerry Springer to reveal it to the world!  &nbsp;  Yes, I do think that if I wrote stuff like this here, I could arouse a certain albeit perverted interest in my life. But since I neither have a younger sister nor a younger brother, nor any intention of ending up on Jerry Springer telling the rest of the world that I'm a 'whole lotta woman, girlfriend' I'll desist and instead bore all those who chance upon this with what they never wanted to know!  &nbsp;  Part of this exercise is to keep a&nbsp;'fieldwork diary' in which I follow Cressida's footsteps, whom I should have mailed ages ago but failed to do because of several reasons.  Fieldwork? Ah, yes, some of those who may chance upon this may be labouring under the impression that as an anthropologist, doing fieldwork involves sitting around in a mud hut somewhere in the highlands of Papua New Guinea during the monsoon season, wishing one were back home, but as for me, it doesn't.  &nbsp;  Doing my fieldwork in Germany, that doesn't apply and I know, I know, some may&nbsp;say that I'm doing nothing but going back home. But&nbsp;easy as it sounds, it doesn't work quite that way. Here's a bit of biography for everyone to get the picture: Having grown up in a remote village in Germany&nbsp;(out of the door into the cow-s**t) I left home immediately after leaving school to move to London, to go to university.&nbsp;Five years later, having never lived in Germany as an adult and therefore knowing full well what to do to get a phone connection in England&nbsp;etc, I suddenly find that I have no clue as to how living in Germany works.  &nbsp;  Take a simple thing for example: Litter! How many of you have seriously ever spent days on end trying to figure out&nbsp;what to do with one's&nbsp;trash and then, despairing because the&nbsp;system of dividing it up is so complicated, resolved to drive the 20 minutes to France to dispose of it there?&nbsp;  I get a lot of stick for such things from my compatriots who all fail to understand that a) things weren't so complicated when I left, b)&nbsp;things are a little different in England and c) it may sound crap but it's number one in Germany.  &nbsp;  The latter at least relieved&nbsp;me from years of trying to defend my compatriots against accusations&nbsp;&nbsp;such as that David Hasslehoff is still a force to be reckoned with in the German music industry. Yes, I say, yes, he is! And finally I have solved the puzzle surrounding my inexplicably bad taste in music- it's not my fault, it's part of my culture and upbringing, and I have a whole nation standing behind me sharing the same bad taste!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      After three weeks in Germany, which I still call 'home' even though it has become strangely alien to me, I am once more back in Brighton and somewhat relieved to tell the truth. Mainly I reckon because I am once more reunited with Gwendolyn, who is none other than my faithful bike!  I'm supposed to be writing my research outline now so all the hard work of finding a place and getting affiliation with the university of Frankfurt will pay off, but anyone looking out of the window can see why I'm not doing any work. It's nice and sunny and the beach is calling out to me!  Anyhow, I am glad to be back in Brighton or - and no one who has ever heard me complain will believe that- I am glad to be back in the UK. The reason for that is very simple indeed- Germany surprised me by how foreign and strange it had become. Okay, not really 'strange', but just strange enough to make me feel alien. Things like dividing up litter before throwing it away, weighing your own veg before paying for it and the general rudeness of shop-assistants and random people in the street, made me feel more than a little alienated. In short, I am not entirely sure about moving back since getting a culture-shock seems way too silly for me to get when in actual fact I have lived for 18 years in that country. And still the UK felt like 'home' when I came back and realized how glad I was to be back in a country where I know my way around.   Everyone laughed at me, when I said that I have difficulties with German mannerisms, claiming that they weren't that different from English ones. Well, I believed all those saying that and nevertheless found myself in situations that required appropriate answers that I simply didn't have anymore. Example: Sitting in a beergarden, I lit up a cigarette. The smoke from my fag slowly wafted towards a girl sitting close by. Obviously a militant non-smoker of the sort that gives you evil looks whilst probably imagining you slowly rotting and screaming for help, she cleared her throat and barked at me: "Oi, you! Can you put that fag somewhere else?"  No 'please', no 'thank you', while I, getting flustered answered: "Of course, I am ever so sorry that I didn't notice- sorry!" Obviously not the appropriate answer. The look she gave me was more than puzzled, while I was getting annoyed over the fact that she had been so rude and I had clearly not given then right answer which possibly might have been: "If you don't like it go somewhere else, now p*** off!" Chances are that everyone else noticing that exchange probably thought I was licking her arse, which is a highly annoying thing to think!  In any case, that is just one example why I'm glad to be back in the UK, even though I'm not all that glad to have to write my dissertation now and pack up my room as soon as possible afterwards then. In fact, I don't want to go to Germany. I mean, it's a nice place and I have lovely friends there, but it feels alien and weird and only now do I realize why everyone always says that Germans are a) rude and b) don't have a sense of humour. About the latter- well, yes, I am a cynic, but am I bitter? I don't think so...
