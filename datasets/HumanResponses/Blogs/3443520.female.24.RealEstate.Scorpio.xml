      Well... only 12 hours left of this lovely facility.... thank God!!  I am off to Mexico tomorrow night, I am soooooo stoked on that :-)  I haven't had this much time off a year so it will be nice and relaxing.  I am not really stressing on the job thing, there is really no use in worrying about it too much until I get back.  Besides, I am sure I will have an offer that I want to take within a week.  The pay was good here but there are just some things in life that are more important than money (s/a being treated with respect!!) I am super tired, I was up late because I went to Scott's last night... then I woke up early and went running.  For those of you who don't agree with MY decision (remember this is my life)... I honestly don't care.  I am old enough to decide for myself what I want to do and honestly... I don't want to date right now.  I am really over the whole freaking scene and I am used to the situation with him, I am comfortable with him, and I guess I have just accepted things for what they are. This is my take on the whole dating situation right now, for all of those that are "concerned" about the fact that I "hate" men.  I will get over it ok?  I honestly don't hate them... I really like them and that's the problem.  I always get all into these guys and nothing ever comes out of it... it all turns out to be a big, huge, waste of my time and I am sick of it. I haven't been "completely single" this long since I was about 18 and this is all very refreshing for me right now. I am working out, I eat healthier, I don't drink, I don't have mood swings all the freaking time and I honestly believe I can attribute most of this to the fact that I am not into dating right now.  So there!  Anyways, enough about all that... when I get back from Mexico I need to start eating a little better.  I have been working out on a reg basis for two months now (yay me).  I do feel good, and I know obviously I am in better shape cardio wise and all that junk, but I haven't lost much weight... and that's because I just eat too damn much.  I eat healthy and stuff, usually, but just a lot of healthy food :-)  Well, not A LOT, just a normal amount I guess.. but you need to eat less to lose (duh) So that's the plan.  I am going to start this program that I created for myself on June 5 and stick with it for three months. I know I will notice a difference.  So I will write out my little plan because doing stuff like that motivates me.... Basically, as some of you know, I have been reading diet books and nutrition crap since I was 16 or so, I know A LOT... I just never really followed much of it.  I have to do some minor refreshing because I forgot some of what I've learned... but anyways... as usual I am going off.  This is for me though, and just because I have it posted for all to see doesn't mean I am here to entertain :-)  I am going to wake up every morning (Tues-Sun) and run 3-6 miles.  I am still working on my running program, so I will post that later.  It's not as simple as "run 5 miles"...cuz, like I said before, I am going to start running in 5K's, and I want to be fast.  Therefore, some days will be speed workouts, some will be steady state, tempo, endurance, etc.   Three nights a week, I will do a second cardio-type workout, and of those three... I am 1-2 will be crosstraining.   The remaining three nights, I will do weights, alternating with upper and lower bod workouts.  Abs every day.    As for nutrition... somewhere in-between "high protein" and "Body for Life" by Bill Phillips... 5 meals a day. My first one will be after my morning workout, then every three hours after that.  I am going to fit them all in before 7pm.   For my first two meals, one serving of protein and one serving of "good" carbs.  Third/Fourth meals, one serving of protein and one serving of veggies, fifth meal, one serving of protein.  All in all thats about 200-300 calories for each meal... which totals about 1000-1500 a day which is good.  1200 is basically the customary intake num for weight loss... so I will try to get that in.   Well enough about this I gotta go LATERS!!!

      Well, this is pretty ironic... I am posting for the first time at my soon-to-be ex-job :-)  My last day is Wednesday, so I don't have much going on.  In fact, there is never much going on here, which is part of the reason why I am leaving.... I need more of a challenge.  I am not sure what I am going to end up doing... I am going to Mexico for a week and I probably won't think about it until I get back.  What's the use?  I sent out my resume to a bunch of places, and I have gotten a few calls and e-mails back... but I don't really "feel it" on any of them.  For instance, one place sent me an 8pg interview sheet... with all kinds of annoying questions on it.  Honestly, it probably wouldn't take very long to type out a bunch of BS and e-mail it back to them... and hell, I am really good at BS literature (aka College!)... but I don't want to work for a co that would want a freaking 8pg interview for such a stupid position anyways.  I was thinking of applying at McDonalds, but I am not sure on that one... I mean the last thing I want to deal with is some stupid-ass 300 lb 18 year old with massive acne yelling at me because I gave him a 1/4 pounder instead of a Big Mac.  Fast food is freakin nasty... I will eat Rubios and stuff but McDonalds?? SICK... why would you want to eat that crap?  Their hamburgers have this greenish tint to them and they warm their food under freaking light bulbs.. sick.  Their ice cream is ok, so is that yogurt thing with fruit and granola.    Ok I am talking about McDonalds toooo much.  Hmmm it's 400 and I have another 2.5 hours to go before I am out of this wonderful facility. I would just type for the rest of my shift but that might look a little weird..  Anyway.  Hmmm, thinking thinking.  After work I think I am going to go home and run 3-4 miles and maybe do some light abs.  I ran twice yesterday so I don't wannna overdo it... but I also need to get more workouts in so I can do good in the 5K I am running in in July.  I haven't raced in like 10 years, so this should be interesting... but I decided that running will be my new hobby.  Other things bore me or they are expensive and it's free to run... :-)   Well this is a really pointless post so I am gonna go... maybe I will start writing more personal things as time progresses but for now I am just staying really conversational...  laters

      well it's been awhile since i last wrote  not much is new... went out with mike again on thursday.  i like him... but i am still not sure which direction i want to take with him.  all in good time i guess.  its his birthday today so i have to call him, i am trying to play the game but i guess this is the exception. i also met chris on friday night, he was nice.. we just went and got pizza and drank some beers... then went to the movies.  i am not attracted to him though, but he is a nice guy.  i am sure thats why i am not attracted..... haha.   other than that, i was supposed to meet the other chris on sunday but i was tired and he is just sooo shy.  its actually pretty cute, we will meet eventually i'm sure... i am not in a rush to go out and meet anyone right now so i guess it doesnt matter. mitch wanted to hang out on sunday night but i was soooo tired from being out late on saturday, so i flaked as usual.  i might head out there sometime this week.. maybe wednesday or something like that saturday night was fun, went out with rebecca jill and crystal to some bar..  i met a really cute guy, but he is only 23.  he is almost 24 though so i guess it's ok.  we'll see if he calls sunday night i studied for my GMATs because i have to take them in a month and i am horrible at math!! i think i am just going to start studying on my lunch breaks and after work.  i should do ok if i study like that for the next month or so... just gotta be on top if it i am really confused in terms of guys right now.  i think its fun just to date for now... i am pretty much focused on grad school right now so i dont think i want to get into anything serious, but i guess you never know. i dont know, i am starting to think i might never get married.  i mean whats the point of it honestly?  being single is just better because you cant get hurt and there is no drama.  i am not really jaded on love but i just think that humans weren't meant to be with only one person.  maybe i will have an open marriage if i get married.  i mean, hubby will probably cheat anyway... so why should i make him promise not to?? might as well just tell him he can so that way... i will be expecting it!  just as long as there are no emotions involved. bla bla this is annoying. i am sitting here at work and all i can think about are stupid guys. i have issues..

      Couldn't come up with anything creative for the subject line on that one.  Anyway, I don't have much time to write because I am going out with Mike.  I am not really in the mood.. I dunno.  It's not that I don't wanna date, I do but I HATE the first few dates!! They are soooo  annoying!!! Oh well Anyway... not much is new here.  Same old shit.  I am really in good spirits these days... it's strange.  Hmmm I dont want relationship I just want bang bang bang

      Well, I haven't been writing in this lately because I have been sooooo freaking busy!!!  I honestly haven't even had much time to sleep, much less type on stupid blogger :-) Anyway... this last week has been hectic.  I started temping at this new place, it's ok, as usual... I am bored and it's not challenging me whatsoever, so I am just going to finish my three week assignment and move on with my lovely little life.  I just need to find something I actually enjoy doing versus something I just do to make money.  All in good time I suppose.  Other than that, there has just been a lot of drama.. wears me out sometimes.  Paul passed away yesterday.  It just kinda trips me out because we are the SAME AGE and I had a crush on him for years when I was like 14... and I dunno, it's just odd.  I really feel for his immediate family and EVERYONE right now.  It just sucks.  Then it seems like all of my friends are having drama in their relationships and it just makes me want to push guys away even MORE than I already doooooo!!! Honestly, this weekend with Scott, Stephanie, Rebecca, and EVERYONE... it doesn't bother me at all when they talk about it... but it makes me SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO anti relationships!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I honestly change my mind about this like every single day.  One day I hate men and I don't want anything with anyone, then I think... well maybe just dating, then it's maybe I want a relationship... then it goes back to hating agian!!  I don't freaking understand myself.  I don't even have the time right now to be caring about this shit.  I need to study for my fucking GMATs and I just want to concentrate on running and training and work and NOOO RELATIONSHIPS!!! I love my "friend" life right now.. can't complain.  I just don't wanna date.  I went out last night with Ryan.  I am so not feeling it anymore. He is a nice guy, pretty good personality, def a cutie, and he is pretty intelligent.  HOWEVER he is just sooo fuckin superficial, it drives me nuts!  I don't wanna talk shit but I just don't like that, it's a big turn off so I am not going to seee him anymore.  There is no use, and I am not just gonna use him or whatever so I am over it.    Other than that, I am also over Jason, he parties too much and I am supposed to go out with Mike this week so we shall see.  I just pretty much know what kinda guy I like and usually within 1-2 dates I know if I want to continue or not.  I just haven't met anyone NEW that I find interesting since I met Mark last fucking August... and it's not like I haven't been trying.  I have been out with or talked to about 10 guys since him and it's just freakin hard.  I am not picky at all I guess I am kinda specific!  Soooo yeah since Mark and before that Scott and before that... umm I guess I kinda liked John but I was drinking sooo much back then so I don't really remember being sober enough to think about it in much detail.  Oh well, I am not concerned about it really, everyone else talks about how "Jennie won't date" more than I do.. and I am sooo sick of it!!  I just wanna run!!  I want to train for that marathon and just concentrate on something I can actually fucking control.  So this is the little plan I developed. I have another 5K on July third.  Then... I think I am running in another on the 24th of July.  In August there is a 5mile run... so that is about 8k, September a 10k, October the Long Beach 1/2 marathon and March is the LA marathon.  I dont know though lots of people say the La marathon sucks... so I might run one in San Diego or something if its between feb-march.  we shall see but I am going to run one dammit and noone will stop me!!  speaking of running i should get that done now ,, im out!

      Well I am pretty much over being unemployed.  It's only been a week, and really if you include the vacaion pay they cut me at the end...it's only been about 3 days, but it's BORING!!!!!  I honestly don't know how people can stand to go weeks...months...without a job!  What do you peope do all day if you aren't working?!?!  Anyway, I am startng this assignment on Tuesday, it's only for three weeks, but at least I won't have to go into my savings to pay my bills this month :)  I am still not sure what I want to do.  I am thinking something in realestate, and my fortune cookie today mentioned real-estate, so maybe it's a sign!! Haven't been doing much today, went to Trader Joes and got some groceries, went to the gym, and that was about it.  I thinking I should go workout again, gotta love it!  I had a really good workout last night, mostly cardio but I was felt soooo good when I was running on my treadmill! Lets see... so my dad really needs to start taking care of him self.  He just go a body scan done and he's not healthy.  Pisses me off because he could do something to fix it all...but he is just laughing about it, like it is some kind of joke or something like that!!  It's soooo not funny.  Honestly, I want my dad to be alive if/when I get married and have kids... frankly that is not gonna happen anytime SOON so he better get his shit together because I will serioulsy be bitter toward him if he doesn't.  There is no reason for it, and it's not even really a weight issues, it's a health issue dammit. I guess I just don't understand.   But I have things to do so im off

      So.. yes I did flake on tonight but I honestly do not feel attractive right now....soooo it wouldnt have gone well anyways. Well, enough about that... NEWS FLASH Jess and Sean are back together, she is so cute.  She was going on and on about it last night and I can tell she really loves him.  I dunno though, I am not big on the whole idea of "all you need is love".   This is mainly due to the fact that love is an emotion, an emotion that blinds you and turns some of us into the most moronic individuals on the universe.  It makes you deillusional and vulerable and all kinds of other fun and exciting stuff that hinders your ability to see things for the way they really are.  Besides, love is an emotion, and saying all that the only thing you need for a relationship to work is love is just not freaking logical.  Wife beaters claim that they love their wives, but do you actually believe that their relationship should work?!?! People who cheat on eachother claim that they love eachother, but obviously... their relationships aren't working because ... well duh.  I don't know, I just think you need more than love alone to make a relationship work... I am not gonna get into the details of it all, but that's just how I feel

      Well I went to the gym yesterday, had a pretty decent workout.  I honestly thought I would be out of shape because of Mexico... but I think I actually got in better shape out there!!  I did workout there, but I was kinda hungover when I was working out, also, it was like 100 degrees at 7am, and it was kinda shitty running on the uneven gravel crap.  I dunno I ran on the treadmill and its a little easier to run on that little guy than it is on the streets :-) I did the eliptical machine for 25 minutes and that was boring me... I was sweating but it was boring me... So I decided to run on the treadmill.... ran my first mile in about 845 and then for the second one I ran slow at a 10 min pace for 400m then an 8min pace for 400m and did a repeat of that cooled down for a bit then did some abs..    I am supposed to go on a date tonight but I really dont want to because I got way way too much sun and I think I look like an oompa loompa and I have a sore on my lip, dont what the guy to think I have herpes or anything like that... but I dunno.  Maybe when he calls I will just tell him its cool but that my lip hurts and I dont want him to think that.. but I dunno, then he might think I am a little crazy... maybe I will just go inconito and never talk to him again, lol god I cant believe I still do that...   Anyway, ok whatever I will go.  Who cares honestly, he knows I went to Mex and if he is gonna be weird about that then I dont want to hang out with him anyways!   So there.    Still searching for jobs, might consider this place in Pomona, a little far but they have good benefits and good advancement opps and what not.  We shall see.  Other than that, nothin much going on.... went to breakfast with Jess this morning, got caught up on the laundry, need to organize my room because its pissin me off...   Thats it.  I gotta go workout!!

      Well... I got back from Mexico this afternoon.  GOOD TIMES!!!  I went down to San Felipe for our annual Memorial Day weekend vacation, and I had a blast.  It was actually pretty mellow down there considering Jenny, Krissy, Tris, Taryn, Emily, and Jeff were all gone.  I hung out with Sash the entire time, and a little bit with Jess and Katie.  All and all it was pretty fun.  Jess and I were fighting the entire time... so that was kinda shitty, but we've been a little too close for comfort in recent months so I guess it was due.  I just get frustrated with her sometimes... I know she is only 20 but STILL!!!  I was drunk... a lot there, which was long overdue as well.  I hadn't been drinking either so it was about time I caught up again.  All I have to say is that we all need to remember that there IS in fact water in margaritas.  Sometimes we get a little silly and a little drunk and order blended margaritas in Mexico... forgetting that they don't have much of a policy on clean water down there.... and well you can let your little minds wander from there. My dad calls me an alchy after I drink 2 beers... that gets annoying.  First off, if I were an alchy I wouldnt be drinking beer, and second since when does having two drinks when you are on VACATION justify alcoholism... silly kid. My freaking nose is peeling and its pissing me off... Jennie the red nosed ummm well I cant really think of a noun to fill in there but if you think of one let me know.  Ok I am talking about the most retarded stuff.. I have been on vaca for too long.    So I thought a lot this trip and I made a lot of goals for myself and what not..  I wrote them all down and everything.   I will accomplish yes I will... I thought about school and work and love and my family (whom I love) haha... and just a bunch of other things as well.  I am trying to evaluate myself now because I am a little lost these days.  I have admitted that I am obviously having a quarter life crisis... obviously with my job jumping and crap like that. I am just confused.. I guess thats part of my age though.  Before I left I wrote Scott this really long ass e-mail..  I dont really remember verbatim what I wrote in it... just that I loved him and things like that.  I deleted it so I wouldn't unsend it, so I don't really remember the details of it all, but it felt good.  I haven't been honest with him about my feelings, even though I think they are pretty obvious, but I just needed him to know.... for whatever reason.  I am sure someone thinks I make sense.  Basically, I am moving on from him because he wont commit to me, and thats what I want.  So its all well and good, doesn't really hurt all that much  because I came to terms with the reality of it all a while ago, but I guess that was just my final little letting go move.  It's weird though because I can handle the friendship thing him... we were never really serious or anything so it's really going to be easy to make that transition.  Random.  Mitch just called me.  He is funny but I am not attracted to him in the least.  His message is probably the same as usual... "Hey its Mitch... you arent going to call me back so I wont even say that... but hope you are doing good and you should actually pick up your phone etc".... haha I never really pick up my phone... I have to be in the mood to talk, thats why I have more missed and dialed calls than received calls.  I just never feel like talkin when it rings... maybe 2 min later, but never really that moment.  Unless it was Scott lol which makes me a lil pathetic but whatevs... no more!  I dont know... I was thinking about it and I kinda want someone, well not someone but something like I had with Todd.  It was way back when but we were just chill with eachother, so I want that in a guy but with the lovey feelings I have for Scott but with some of the personality aspects of Mark and maybe Marks looks too.  Although everyone thought Todd was soooo hot bla bla but he was just ok to me.  I dunno.. no more discussions on guys.  I think I am gonna end this now... adios
