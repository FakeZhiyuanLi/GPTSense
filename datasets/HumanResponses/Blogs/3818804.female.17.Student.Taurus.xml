      Wow! This morning I got breakfast! My mother made pancakes, eggs, and hot links! Yipee! I did my happy dance after that...Then it was off to my uncle's house for a barbeque. Little did I know that in just thinking it was only my uncles house and decided to dress nappily, there were boys there...Oops! Oh well, they'll be seeing plenty of me on other days when I'm sexy as hell...lolz ;) And of course I went to go see FIREWORKS!!! It's so cool, every year we go over to these people's house and lay on the lawn and watch fireworks as the come toward our faces...or at least that what it seems like. It's very cool. I watched in awe while getting attacked at the stomach by Brandon...my adorable and sometimes annoying baby cousin. We also bought the "TNT package" for 50 friggin' dollars!! ahhh! But they had these sparkler things or whatever, and it was like a strobe light. Well, the point of my story is that my dad and I started doing the robot. lolz... We had an audience too of like 30 people...good times good times. Hardy har har. When we got home, of course, we had a snack because we're fat like that...lolz. FOOD IS GREAT! So here I am...bored off my arse. I think I'm going to breakfast tomorrow with Sam and Jenn. Yummay! Till later toots!  P.S. Alex is taking me out on July 6th partially because that's when he can legally drive others and partially because i told him he is...and he's my bitch. ;) lolz..J/k I love ya! XOXO

      Today was one of those days where I got ticked off for little things...For example:  I had just gotten out of the shower when my dog started scratching the door. She was doing this to tell me it was time for dinner. However, I was not nearly dressed to walk across the house, so I opened the door and asked my mother "Can someone please feed the dogs?" She asked me why I didn't and I told her I had just gotten out of the shower. Then she mumbled something I didn't hear because I was shutting the door. She was just sitting there watching t.v. I mean you can't just get up and walk your fat arse ten steps for the dogs. A chore that takes like a minute to do...  WHATEVER!  That was only like one of the ten things that pissed me off.  Today was my sisters 20th birthday. Sam was here this weekend of course, just like everyother weekend. They went to ride horses at Huntington Beach and then they or rather Sam went boogie boarding. Then after they came home we all went out for dinner, The whole familia. We got some serious grub on. yea yea. yummay! When we were going to order our food the waitress lady asked my mom if my sister and I were her daughters and then she said that I didn't look like her daughter (my mothers) and etc. etc. I thought it was so nice of her to say that I didn't look like my mom's daughter. I just thought it was so nice how a stranger could make you feel so warm inside with her stupid comments.  I'm going to the beach tomorrow. Newport baby! Come with me, call me up ;)  You learn something new everyday...Today I learned that the rocks leading out to the beach is called a jetty.  P.S. Get up offa that floor, Shake it, you'll feel betta'. Get up offa that floor, you gotta release that press-sha!

      That seemed to be my word of choice today....I got cuts, bruises, and scrapes. I also was&nbsp; being clumsy today. More than usual, it was annoying.   Today Jenn was being very sexual, more than I have ever seen her get. lolz. It was hill-jarious! First off I went to the fridge to see if we had any meat to eat because I need to loose some weight and I want to diet. lolz....Yea, so anyways I was like "We need more meat" And then Jenn said something....I don't quite remember but she said it in a way that made it seem like she was talking about penises. She was like....You can get some big&nbsp;meat or something like that and I started laughing so hard. And then we started painting these wood blocks we pre-drilled holes and my job was to take the dowels (skinny sticks) and put them trough the hole so the wood could dry. Well after she finished painting them I tried to put the dowels in the hole and I missed and I had to try for like a while...and she said "That's why you're not a boy" LOLZ... I was crackin' up so bad.   I had a Burger King Chicken Ceasar Salad....It was gooood and diet friendly.   P.S. Take me out to Raging Waters or Six Flags Or the beach..I love you! lol...I'll give you a cookie

I get darker and darker everyday and I try not to, I mean&nbsp;I wear so much sunblock and I try to stay out of the sun as much as&nbsp; I can because I don't want to be too black for my senior pictures....But it's to freakin'' late bitches!!! Darn it...   I worked this morning for a while and then got pissed and stopped. I cleaned up and headed to TARGET....Target is my home&nbsp; boy.&nbsp; I love it there, but yep I got some essentials because my dad is too lazy to go do the shopping like he's supposed to. I got this lotion from Suave its like Vanilla and Roasted marshmallows...yum. Smells edible ;)   After Target I went to my uncle's house for a bit where&nbsp;I got hit in the face... or rather bitch slapped by my two year old cousin...lolz and then my other cousin got mad at me and dug his nails in me and BROKE SKIN!!! You little shit head.   I then came home and worked somemore and sweated somemore...and can't forget! Got bossed around somemore and took it like a woman&nbsp; if I may add...   It's so hot!!! I want to go to Raging Waters, Six Flags, and the beach so if you want to take me, call me up bitches...lolz :D j/k I love you...but I really do want to go!   P.S.

      I just ate Panda Express and it was kind of good and kind of nasty all at the same time... Have you ever eaten something and then when you were done you ask yourself "What the hell is this shite I just ate?" Because I ask myself that sometimes. lolz. When I was opening a soysauce packet it&nbsp;popped in my face... &nbsp;  I worked hard today in the hot hot sun...I also turned black as black can be, I am now officially darker than Jenn.  &nbsp;  I was going to go to Knott's Berry Farm on Wednesday, but it's way too hot for that shite. I want to go to Raging Waters...I haven't been there in like ten years...BUT I really really really want to go to Six Flags!!  &nbsp;  Not much to say...so, until next time love  &nbsp;  P.S. Take me out biatches

      Well, today had to be the worst and a fairly good day I've ever experienced. Let's start it off with the morning. I woke up at 8:30, or rather I got abruptly awoken by my father's yelling. "Get up it's time to work!" I wake up my back hurts and I don't know what going on and I get yelled at....It's so nice to have a nice wake up call. "You're useless" "Why didn't you wake up when we told you to?" "We don't need you go away" "You&nbsp;make everything so inconvenient"&nbsp;Those are just some of the nicest comments I've ever heard...I bite the bullet and take the brunt of the bull. Once again my thoughts are put in void and I take the harsh words and try not to cry. So I got to work without "pay" and sweated every second of it. It was so freakin' hot. However, all I have to say to this is I was only 15 minutes late and they act like I missed the whole gravy train.  &nbsp;  My mother said she had been wanting to go to Macy's for the past couple of days an so she decides to go today. She says "Me and Jennifer will go to Macy's. Julia will stay home" It's cool whatever make a big deal out of nothing and rub it in my face. As if I don't feel like an outsider in the family anyways just make me feel more uncomfortable. Like I said before, you think you know, but you have no idea. Our family looks all happy go lucky but it's not...just like lots of other families. And after the ranting and raving about my inconvenience to the family they act like nothing happened and we're all cool with each other. I FUCKIN' HATE THAT!  &nbsp;  On a happier note their happy go lucky vibes pay off. I got to go to Macy's...lolz. I also got a new phone! A camera one! lol...I was happy and then of course someone has to ruin it. We get in the car and my mother gives the speech she gives all the time after we get something. "You guys have to work hard yadda yadda esp. you Julia"  wtf?   WHATEVER!     &nbsp;   *sigh*  There are so many incidents and so many thought that come to mind that I couldn't possibly type the amount of pain that I have when she talks about how useless I am. It actually hurts, inside, in my heart.  &nbsp;  Anyways....I sound like a sad child...I just have my days as we all do I suppose...  &nbsp;  P.S. I got a camera phone!!  &nbsp;  P.S.S. I hate my family sometimes and wish&nbsp;I could run away for a day, can I run to you?&nbsp;

      Where do I begin? My night was so eventful it was unbelievably funny. First, I went to go see THE VILLAGE by the Shamalama guy. I was supposed to go see it with Karen and Anna, but then Tiffany, Desi, Evinne (sp?) and her boyfriend Chris came along. Me, Karen and Anna liked it, it has a good twist. They didn't like it because they didn't understand it. lolz...But I liked it, you should go see it. I crapped my pants...Just because of the suspense. But whatever I liked it. So after the movies when we were leaving it was Me, Karen, Anna, and Tiffany and we were walking to the car and these guys in this car started like following us while we were walking and they were like "hey baby" and shit like that and we couldn't see but we just ignored them. Then they drove off saying "It's because we're Mexican huh?" And so I yelled back "They're Mexican too you dumbass." But whatever, that was the first time I got hit on like that...Weird. lol, but nonetheless was funny.  After the movies we decided to go to McDonald's because we were starving. So we went to one and we ate in and then the night started to get interesting. We went in and the two guys working the counters looked like they were ten....But anyways it was kind of funny. While we were eating Tiff and Anna spotted something and they had a look of shock on their faces so I turned around to see. And THERE WAS A MAN WITH A COLLARED SHIRT IN A BRIGHT BLUE SPEEDO WITH KNEE HIGH SOCKS.... LOLZ.. Karen was sitting next to me and I was like "Look in the reflection, Look in the reflection!!!" And she was like :0 It was so funny. When Tiff and I went looking for him while "getting refills" We heard this guy say "Man, I think I lost my appetite." I got a picture of him on my phone! But um he was far away....I think that's a good thing. hahaha. Then while leaving I elbowed some guy...oops! And then when leaving the place there group of guys were looking at us and I was like "Get in the car before we get raped!" It was Anna's idea to go to that certain McDonald's and I will never trust her again!!! lolz..  Told ya it's never dull with those gals....I had a good time.  Oh ya know what? I really like Alicia Keys... I think she's really Classy. yeap, anyways..  What has recently been on my mind... :D Wellllll... I had a good day except for when David told me that he had to leave for a week.... :( it's only been like a day and I miss talking to him....lolz.. I think I understand when people who have b/f or g/f's feel when they make a big deal about a week when their lover is gone....He isn't my lover, just to set the record straight. lol. Just miss talking to him is all since we talk like everyday.  OOOOhhhhhhh!!! Let me tell you this! lol...  Side note: I think I laugh too much...  Back to my story, David had a dream about me! lolz... Tells you how much he thinks about me ;) I will spare you the details because it's none of your business. But yea, he's a cool guy....He makes me laugh A LOT. And everyone knows how much I love to laugh and make people laugh....That and food. So if I find out he cooks I don't know what I'll do! Hardy har har. Yea....  Ok I think I've written enough....  P.S. My uterus stopped hurting!! yay.

      Lolz. My dad said that....And my sister and I thought it was hill-jarious because it made him sound like he was the hulk or somethhing. We laughed for a while....I think it's a girl thing.  My fish, Derek, has Tail Rot for the past month or so now. Since he was only like 12 cents I didn't want to but stuff for him and I thought he was going to die like.....a month ago. lolz. BUT the tough somma bitch is still alive and swimming with no fins whatsoever. lolz...It's kind of sad but yea. I wanted to freeze him because that's the most human way, but my pops wont let me...so I guess he will have to suffer the hell in his tank. I'm sorry Derek I love you man!  Today or tonite rather, I'm going to the movies with Karen, Anna, and myself to see THE VILLAGE. ooooohhhhhh. Scary.....ahhhhhh. By Night M. Shyamalan...ramam lama lama ding dong. Yea so I hope it'll be decent, I haven't been to the movies in a LONG time....I think the last time I went I saw "Day without a mexican" But yuh. Jenn wanted to go to the movies but when she heard we was seein' THE VILLAGE she didn't want to go. Me here. I'm a scary movie gal and she ain't. So yeps...  Oh on Sunday I'm going to hang with my chicas Anna and Tiffany. Uhhh...lolz. I don't know what we're doing but it'll be fun we never seem to have a dull moment. ya ya.  I think I like a guy...  P.S.

      I had a good time today guys...  I went swimming at Denay's house with Karen and Anna tambien. We had fun and Anna gave me cool nail polish that changes colors in the sun. It was tizzight. Yeap. Then we swam, dove, and slid into and around the pool. Karen and Anna left and then Denay and I went out. We went to drop of some film at Costco and then we went to Mcdonald's for some grub. I got a parfeit! yum. then she dropped me off at mi casa.   While lounging around poolside we happened to conjur up old memories....it was fun. Like ***** looking like she's lactating and pissed her pants. It was perty funny. And the TJ Maxx lady...yeap. Good times good times...It was cool to go out with Denay too. We don't really hang out one on one so it was cool to talk to her and open that friendship up.   Tomorrow I go to the beach...beaches!!! lolz...

      This morning while picking up poop from the backyard I started walking towards the trash cans and I got caught in a GIANT SPIDER WEB. OMG you guys, It scared the shite out of me!!! There are two kinds of webs the ones that are really easy to break and the ones that are made of like super duper harder web stuff and aren't as easy to break. Well I got caught up in the hard one and when I looked up there was a giant brown spider like two inches from my face....That's when&nbsp;I freaked out and started screaming and flailing my arms in the air like an imbicile. BUT no one came to my rescue they were just laughing, you punks. I could of died. But yea I was really scared that it would get on me and eat me from the inside....lolz, ok maybe not that but I was scared.   Yesterday I took&nbsp; my senior pictures...I realized why I don't like going to take pictures...The picture takers are always so non-friendly. But anywhos that took all of like ten minutes and I was kind of blind from the flashing lights but whatever. We got the hellz out of there. I saw Jennay in there all beauty-fied and thanks Kat for doing my hair.   Today I get to see my chicals...and get my tan on without caring about tan lines because of stupid pictures. Not like I need one considering I am already black.   yea...till later babes   P.S. I want to go to Six Flags, Raging Waters, and the beach...and anywhere else you'd like to take me ;)

      Did I tell you that&nbsp;I broke one of my contacts (I have hard contacts) and I went to order a new one and its been about a week that I have been contactless and I'm slowly going blind...&nbsp; I know that when I put it on it's going to hurt like a mofo...   We got the Ashlee Simpson cd yesterday from wally mart...My guilty pleasure I suppose, My name is Julia and yes I like Ashlee Simpson...don't help me...lol. She's alright. She has this song called "Lala" She says "You make me wanna LALA, in the kitchen, on the floor, I'll be your french maid, where I'll meet you at the door..." It's funny, but yuh...   I went for my interview yesterday at TJ's and&nbsp;I believe it went well. Everyone seemed nice and smily but of course we have to be...but we had laughs, I think I left a good impression. I also talked to this lady that works there and she kept on saying " Oh, you're in..." lolz...She was cool. Wish me luck, I hope I get it guys!!!   I have senior pictures today...whoop dee doo daaa. That'll take all of like 10 minutes. Tomorrow I'm going to Denay's house to swim with my chicals that I haven't seen in a long while... yay!! Then on thursday I'm going to the beach...yay!!&nbsp;I finally get to wear my bathing suit without worrying about my tan lines for pictures!! yay! lolz...   Ohhh! yea, while a burger king yesterday in the drive through I saw two cops bustin this guy, I thin khe had some drugs or something....There were two guy sitting in the back of the cop cars and they were searching their car...it was cool.   My heart is conflicted.... It gets in the way....so does my brain....lolz   P.S. I miss fishing....

      Why do you tell me things I don't want to know about?&nbsp;I will leave it at that.... *sigh*   But let me tell you about something funny that I forgot to put in last time I was blogging...I was talking to a friend and I don't really remember the subject was but we started talking about natural sugars. And I said "like fruit?" He goes "Yea, for some reason Pizza was the first thing that came to mind." Whoa! Pizza...no natural sugar there pal...   Back to my ranting..It's ok because there are plenty of fish in the sea of men......guys......boys. Whatever, you know what I mean. But I need to find someone to save me from myself..lolz. I've been listening to love songs and it kills me...but it's ok. He will come...Like everone tells me, but when he does...I'm going to kick his ass and ask why the hell he took so fuckin' long!!! I think it's also because&nbsp;I don't get comfortable with people easily. People make me nervous, especially if I like you. I suppose I could push you away with that...but I've only felt really comfortable with one person...and that obviously wouldn't work because it was wrong to begin with.   Side Note: I loved being totally comfortable with him...it was a great feeling not caring about the way you looked or acted because you knew he accepted you either way, that and he was equally retarded...lolz  anyways, so yea, I get like this sometimes...I think it comes in waves. Sometimes I could really care less and then there are times when I really do want someone. I'm a dork.   Anywhos I got a call back from TJ Maxx and I am set up for an interview on Monday at 3:00. Yay! Wish me luck, loves! I was supposed to go shopping for clothes today, but I didn't and that didn't make me too happy. I need to look good for my interview. ;)   Oh yea! Today I woke up at 7:30 and started working and my uncle came over to help put up the patio cover thing.&nbsp;Sam stayed later as well, He was supposed to go home this morning, but he stayed to help my dad...how sweet. But yea, it was kind of funny because my uncle and Sam were sitting on the top of the&nbsp;patio&nbsp;thing and they were just chillin' like 12 feet in the air...We had monkeys..glad it was them working instead of me :D   Till later toots!   P.S. I'm not so happy anymore....

It was fun...I had like a billion customers. Yea, I like my job.  After that Jenn wanted to swim so Her and I went to Anna's again and Jenn went swimming since I was kind of tired....I ate ice cream....lol. Then we went home and Anna came with Me, Jenn and Sam to Papa Mio's for dinner. We went to Brea Mall to find some pants for me...That didn't work out b/c there is no way in hell I'm paying $42 or $38 dollars for pants...hellz no. Not when I know I can get them for like $24. But anyways Anna is taking me to get some tomorrow morning since I don't work till 2:30. Yuh....  P.S. How come you don't call me like you say you would.......

      Today I had to get my work permit, so I went to school at 8 something and got an application, drove to Tj's and got my boss' signature and then drove back to school and got my permit printed out. So I got there at around 9 ish and I went to the "lounge" and there were like 11 people in there and I got stuck with the older people. One table had 4 people, kids, that were hired and the other table had three people on their mid-20's. So they made me sit there. I found out that I was the youngest one there! Everyone introduced themselves like I'm a junior at Cal State Fullerton, I'm a freshman at USC, or crap like that and I was like.."Um, I'm Julia and I'm going to be a senior at Walnut High" lolz....we all started laughing. Yea and then Three LONG  hours started with listening to policies and dress code and filling out papers and such.  Then I ate at like 1 for the first time that day. I had a salad from Burger King...It really is good. But then I got hungry at like 3. I don't think I ate though. Then I went to Anna's to swim with my sister and Anna of course. Then we went to Jack in the box where it smelled like ASS. Then we went to Old Navy, Mervyn's, Marshalls....and any other store that was in the strip mall. lolz, but mission accomplished i got some clothes for my job.  David said he'd call so I hope he does.  P.S. I have to go to work at 8 manana....

      Damn you...I like you so much and you just act like it's nothing. You don't want to talk to me or call me and you always leave. Why can't you just talk to me and tell me your thoughts because sometimes i think you want to continue and then time I think you want to stop. The search for the LALA doesn't end till you say so. I'm here and you can take it or leave it just make up your mind.  P.S. I worked today and got to see the security cameras and I need clothes....

      Where to begin? First off my stomach hurts...(chuckle) owie...no chuckling.  I had a pretty good day yesterday....until yea...anyways, Anna picked me up at 12 and we then picked up Tiffany. We wanted to spend some time with her because, today, Monday, She is going to UCLA and we won't see her for a while. It's not that far, I know but still. We went to Robeekas (Robeks) and then to Rubio's. I got a Mahalo Mango and that is all. Then we visited some friends that live across the way from Tiff. Then we helped her pack and then She took like TEN HOURS to get ready, but then we went to Art's house to Take one car and we went to Bennihannas and the rest is history.  Oh yes, David called me while at Tiff's house and indeed hung up on me. Apparently I am too concieted for him. Sorry if that's the way I came off as, but I am not. And then later when I talked to him he told me that I didn't seem excited that he called. And OH MAN I was! lol, just ask the girls if I was not smiling and jumping up and down like a fool and that was just after hearing he got home early, then he called....Whoa! lolz. But he doesn' t think we should talk like that anymore. Okaaaay.... Would you like to honestly know what I think? Here we go... I know he likes me and likes me enough to think about me a lot and to have a dream about me. Which is good because I like him too and I think about him a lot as well. It just bothers me how He gets upset at me for things and I'm like "what?!?!  :0  " One second he'll be like I've been thinking about you a lot then the next it's like uhhh I don't want to "make you fall for me" When something bothers him about me he just hangs up. What the hell?! Why don't you tell me instead of hanging up? I think it would help a lot. Don't get me wrong, I am not one to say I suppose, I don't express my feelings well when it comes to boys. I think it's because I don't have a positive image of myself, but that's a whole other story. But for the love of Allah, stop leaving like that because it makes me get all upset and I'm like..."Arg!" (chuckles) And I can't talk to you about why your upset at me so I don't know how to fix it or whatever. I have a million questions that got erased by sleep. I would of loved to ask to him but he left and I couldn't so... Whatever...lolz. I'll talk to him tonite.  Oh yea, my job... I have to tell them I want to leave on August 5th till the 10th and if it will cost me my job...I guess Las Vegas here I don't come! whoopie...I was soooo looking forward to getting away...  P.S. I have to go to work this morning, great way to start the day off....

      Today I was supposed to meet Joel...( Jole lolz ) But It was Tiffany's last day with us so Anna decided not to meet with him today. Instead, Anna, Me, Tiffany, Art, and Kevin went to Bennihannas...It was ok. I don't like it there very much but it's ok. I spend like a bunch of money for okay food...er..just don't take me there on a date. lol. But we had a nice chef and such so it was alright. Then tiff, Art, and Kevin were like...not talking to us very  much they had their own thing goin on....that kind of sucked but whatever.  Then I cam ehome to find a sink full or dishes and trash overflowing. So I washed all the dishes and took the trash out...blah. But yea I'm good just waiting for someone to talk to....  David called me today...We talked for like ten minutes or something like that but he came home early! yay! I went online on my phone while at Tiffany's house and saw like 5 messages and sure enough they were from him! lol. and I was reading them and jumping around...LOL...I was excited...I don't know why but I was... Yea but after we were about to hang up and he sort of hung up on me or something....I don't know.....lol, it was wierd. oh well  P.S. Meh...Bennihannas not so good after all...  P.S.S.

It's ok he's on the job. But it was nice to hear from him. He's  a sweetie.  Today I'm going to Anna's and we're going to meet this guy or guys. This guy has got a thing for her and Tiff and I are going with her and I thin khe's bringing his friend or friends....Don't really know...Doesn't really matter to me. But yea...  My mom saved these seeds and she wanted to plant them and left them on the counter and told me not to throw them away and so I didn't. And I forgot to tell my sister the same and she threw them away. lolz...totally my fault. I KNOW! but my mom made me dig through the trash....not the trash like from the kitchen but the trash like the ones you bring to the street!!! What the freakin' hellz yo! but I found them.  P.S.

      Not really, but ok....lol. I got my first pay check today!! yippee.... Oh yea and I worked today too but I wasn't supposed to but it's ok because that's more money for me. Oh yea, and the two stories of the day are these: One- A young gentleman, one of my customers, got stopped for trying to steal? I actually don't know but all I know is that he got stopped. And it was kind of cool to see the undercover detectives at work and kind of scary. I got frazzled. Two- some 30 year old man hit on me...EW.  My feet hurt and so does my back. I also hate inconsiderate customers.... I'M HUNGRY  P.S. My head is spinnin' but my heart is in the right way, sometimes it has to have itself little earthquake.....

      Just got home from lunch at "Daphne's Greek Cafe" with Mitchell. It was good. I liked it. Ya, during lunch this couple walked in and this chick was off the hook. lol. not in a good way!!! It was so funny, I almost choked. After lunch we walked around to the shops and such and ended up going to Brea mall. Checked out the puppies and looked at some clothes. And here I am passing time till work.  Feeling for the time being: I can only be myself, I'm sorry if that's hell for you, I guess you're lookin' for someone else...  And damnit HE NEVER LEAVES MY HEAD. WHY DO I THINK ABOUT HIM SO MUCH? ITS DISCUSTING!!!  P.S. Take me to the beach...
