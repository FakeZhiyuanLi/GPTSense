         What do I do now? :-/  It looks like my diet and excersise buddy soesn't want to be apart of it. :-( Oh well, she's going through a lot now.  Stupid Mikey!!!!  Of course you had to ask me to homecoming.  Of course I would say no.  I thought we had this talk before!  I think of you as like my brother!  NOTHING MORE!  Now Janise doesn't even want to go to homecoming anymore.  Because you said maybe and not yes... and you asked me!  Why is it so hard for you to get over me? :-(  I don't want to be mean but thats just gross!!! :-P  Mikey I love you with all my heart... but its a different kind of love.  We have fights, I can tell you anything and everything, I understand your problems, but it all sums up to being long lost twins. :-/  I could never love you like that.  Atleast I could never dream of it at this point.           Any advise from any readers? :-P  Still looking for someone to go with... *hint*hint*  :-* lol                    XOXO

            W ell, So far this summer has been really odd, but eventful.  I went to Illinois, as usual :-) and accually got to go to a Chicago Bears practice!  I got 12 autographs, not including the mascott, Staley.  I got more autographs than anyone in my family, when I need to, I get agro! :-D ;-)  We sat in front of the true bleacher bums... for once, I felt at home. :-D           On the way home from *DA Bears* practice a huge storm hit us.  Tremendous down poor, insane thunder and lightning, and on top of that 70 mph winds.  It was the best storm I have witnessed that I can remember.  (when I was 2 I was in hurricane andrews, wish I could remember it)  Of course, it had to be ruined but my sister and aunt screaming at the top of their lungs things like, "I can't do this, I can't do this." and "Mom, I see a Tornadoe, OMG were gonna die.  I'm so scared!"  I felt like strangling them both. I screamed back, Corrine, Your gonna do this wether you like it or not, and Emily, SHUT UP!!!!! ITS NOT A TORNADOE!!  I ended up just blocking them out and waatched the storm.  It was AMAIZING!!!!!!!  Lightning accually hit the car a few times and wesaw one bolt of lighting the kind of dissapeared looking like fire.  I was in aww.  My Grandmother (We HAVE to call her MIMI) couldn't see an inch in front of her face so we went to T.G.I. Friday's and got some free food!  Long story but we still payed for alot of it in tips.         We also went to the museum of scince and industry.  It was the best!  I starred in a movie there too.  I'll have to find the link so you guys can see my "professional" acting! :-P             Other than that I cant wait for school, I can't believe I just said that.  I kinda had a summer fling with someone but I think its over. O well, High School, here I come.  I know, Corney.... gotta fix it. :-P      Love you all!!!! :-*
