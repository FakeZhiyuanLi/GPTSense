      Hi  I am in Galway right now staying with a friend in the caravan she lives in. &nbsp;I just arrived last night, but I have gone on a city tour and have already seen quite a bit. &nbsp;James Joyce's wife's house has been made into a museum here, so I want to see that. &nbsp;It was absolutely pouring rain here this morning and I was walking to the bus and this huge truck drove past me and absolutely soaked me with puddle water! &nbsp;I am drying up quite nicely now, so it is better now. &nbsp;It was totally like something you see on t.v. It was so funny! &nbsp;I am not sure how long I will stay here, but I should start heading to Belfast soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend&nbsp;was totally right in thinking that I had totally overplanned what I was going to do! &nbsp;Oh well, as long as I use a few days of my Brit rail pass I will be happy and as long as I do get to London!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you are all doing well and that it is not raining at home. &nbsp;I can't wait to see you all!!!!

      Hello all!   I have just done the world's most touristy thing ever, but I loved it. &nbsp;I went to Blarney castle and kissed the Blarney stone. &nbsp;There was quite a drop below you, but they do hold onto you! &nbsp;It was crazy! &nbsp;I am now in Cork and will stay here tonight and then possibly go to Killarney tommorow.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have a few more minutes on the computer so I am going to have to quit writing soon! &nbsp;I hope that you all are doing well and everything is going well.   Love  Natalie

      Hello Everyone!  I am now in Kilkenny and having a wonderful time! &nbsp; &nbsp;I spent a day inGlasgow and hung out with a Mexican girl and went to the Museum of modern art etc. No deep fried Mars bars to be found I am afraid, Must go to Aberdeen! &nbsp;I spent a few days in Dublin! &nbsp;Dublin is a wonderful city, not quite on the scale of London, I have to say, but still very high up there! I am really enjoying my time! &nbsp;I was quite tired the first day, but I did go on a tour of Dublin and went around a bit. &nbsp;The next day I saw Dublin castle and the book of Kells at Trinity College and then I went to this Dublin experience thing, but fell asleep as I was so tired. &nbsp;I met a nice Kiwi girl and a cute Aussie boy, so I hung out with them until I left Dublin. &nbsp;I wetn on a ghost tour of Dublin with this guy from Seattle that I met. &nbsp;It was so super fun!&nbsp;&nbsp;I then went to the Guiness factory and drank a pint! Then we went to a pub. &nbsp;I left on the train to come to Kilkenny. &nbsp;I went on a tour of the castle and the city and then I missed my train, so now I am here tonight and hopefully on my way to either Waterford or Cork and Blarney tommorow depending on the bus/train etc. &nbsp;The Irish accents are wicked and up for competition with the English, I tell you!&nbsp;&nbsp;They are playing Pulp in the shop I am in now!&nbsp;&nbsp; £££ &nbsp;I can't figue out how to type the Euro sign, but here is the pound for you!!! ££££  Yours, Natalie

      I am still in Calgary and won't be leaving for over a week but there are  still many fun things to do before then.  First of all there is Stampede and  all that it entails.  Then there's getting together with friends and then my  birthday.  Then I will be going!  I will not be back for three weeks.

      I'm going on a trip to Ireland and as much of the UK as possible.  I don't have much planned yet so you will just have to wait and see how it goes.
