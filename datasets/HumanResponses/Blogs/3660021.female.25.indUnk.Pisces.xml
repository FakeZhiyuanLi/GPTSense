						   how many out there are gifted children turned spectacular failures? and how does one continue once it becomes crashingly apparent that one is worse than mediocre at everything our society values?  people would likely say, get psychiatric help to "regain self esteem".  echoing the author jonathan franzen's distaste for our psychotropic (yet self-righteous drug-warring) society of drones, i think psychiatric help is largely just a cash cow and a recruiting zone for dangerous psychiatric drug trials. yet even if it weren't, i would have no need for psychiatric help. why? because i like myself fine...its everyone and everything else about mainstream society i loathe.   i am a good and kind person. i have never intentionally hurt any creature in my entire life. given my hermit like nature, i have most likely not even hurt anyone at all, emotionally or physically. i am strangely satisfied with certain aspects of myself, such as my looks, sense of style, brains, and taste in music, film, etc. perhaps the best part of my life is my cosmic twin/lover/partner/soulmate/ whom i will call "m". m and i have been together for a very, very long time. most people's emotionally and sexually monogamous relationships do not work out for a variety of reasons. but i have always known that if i ever found 'the one', i'd just know it. it is the one part of my life that has worked out, and thank God for that.   thanks to rather wealthy and education-obsessed parents, i have gotten by the last half decade or so flitting around from one university to another. both my parents are physicians, which means they constantly scare people with their tireless talk of bodily decay. early on i wanted to be a veterinarian more than anything due to my special bond and love for animals. This all went out the window when i realized how much i disliked science classes, even in high school.   i have never been able to keep a 'shit job' of the sort most college students get. i am not good at interacting with people, pretending to be friendly, and sucking ass to various bosses. i am also quiet and shy to a fault. just the idea of making an appointment with the dentist can throw me into a terror. yet i always managed to get decent grades as an english major in college, so i decided to go to a ph.d english program in an alien and very cold area of the country. english was my choice because tests throw me into a terror, but writing papers do not. little did i know that being a ph.d means interacting with people who are as socially retarded as i am, but also quite cruel, unkind, and cold. it also meant counseling students constantly, and spending hours engaging in very uninteresting and irrelevant "research". as a high school student i never hated my teachers, just felt an unbelievable amount of pity for them. their chalk stained clothes, wrinkles, lipsticked coffee mugs. so depressing. plus, they get paid crap. i saw the same future for myself and balked. so i walked out. my parents begged me to at least get an MA, but i couldn't deal with anymore.   the only option left was law school. this seemed anathema to those who knew me well. i am a dreamy, stare-into-space person. i also am an artist, painting mostly. i hate arguments and try to steer clear of politics at all costs. the only issue i feel strongly about, not surprisingly, is privacy. yet law, of all careers, seemed to be the most lucrative for the least time spent "climbing the ladder". i'm not looking to be a millionaire, but nor do i want to slave away at something i hate for very little money. the idea of the american dream is laughable to me. the only way you can obtain it is if you win the lottery, are a genius at sports and also are male, or are very smart or very lucky in the field of business. There is also a narrow list of entertainers who have combined luck with appealing to the crappy tastes of most Americans. The only people i believe who don't fall into these categories and have six figure salaries are certain doctors. but as i said, i am not a science person. even social science was not for me in college.   off to law school i went, a first tier law school no doubt, in the same crappy, ice cold area of the country i had escaped when i ditched the ph.d program. my fellow students, in their cookie cutter patterns, repulsed me. the amount they ignored health, happiness, and sanity in favor of studying, ass-kissing, and corporate ladder scaling disgusted me too. there were also a few pretentious, officious, left wing 'save the world' types. walking stereotypes all, the right and left. i watched the smartest people (as well as myself)--the few thoughtful, philosophical, interesting souls with whom i had befriended on a casual level--do absolutely mediocre the first semester. as did i, holding steady with a B- average, evading academic probation. i had heard horror stories from a few of them, and two of my best friends there dropped out after enduring the humiliation of their peers and the constant surveilance techniques of academic probation.   one of my friends was a stanford graduate. i befriended her because, like myself, she loathed the east and felt marrooned. a lot of people disliked her because she said such brilliant, cogent, and yet emotionally compelling things in class. apparently, in law school, one CANNOT speak from personal experience--that is debasing the objective superiority of The Law--and she did this. Apparently people thought she was going to do extremely well, and resented her for it. i admire the dignity with which she came back to school after she found out her grades--she got two D's and the rest C+!! Now, you'd think all of those who hated her for her assumed success would now be kind? Of course not--they kept away from her as if failure was contagious. She left law school because she couldn't take doing so poorly. She cried every day and began to drink heavily (all law students drink heavily, but we're talking about a bottle of Absolut by her bed for her morning drink). She went back to the Bay Area and is now temping, something i loathe and refuse to do ever again. It's very strange talking to her. Law school literally ruined her life. I am compassionate and want to show her so much of that, yet don't want her thinking i 'pity' her. how can i pity her? we're in the same boat now (as you will see as i continue with my story): two people whose brains do not fit in to the narrow mold of our culture's notions of 'smart' 'career' and 'successful'. the only difference is she had wanted to be a lawyer her whole life, while i just wanted a job that would enable me to live very nicely. we both were 'gifted children', we both were expected to do 'great things'. neither one of us will. yet she is so much more devastated by that than i am.  i have learned that the most successful quality a person like myself can have in this society is detatchment. detatchment from other people (minus one's true love), from success, from achievement, from caring about everything. i have moments of these and they feel wonderful, this light floaty feeling that all the hoopla my classmates are engaging in is idiotic, such as this bitch girl in my law school whom i loathe with all of my heart. she is incredibly unattractive in all ways--looks, personality, speech. she is a total follower, one of those who cannot be "popular" because of her lack of mall chick style and constant mouthing off in front of males about obscure cases and statutes. she had the nerve to call up my friend, smarting from her D's and academic probation, and whine about how miserable she was because ALL she got was a B+ and two A-'s. I wanted to kill her.   so at these moments, i think, "debbie", you bitch, you will never be happy. all of your rapid-fire arguing and professor ass-licking will not earn you any kind of peace of mind. because peace of mind is all i am searching for now. i have reconciled to the fact that i will be yet one more person living an unsuccessful life of quiet desperation, that i am not destined for great things or even a "career" of which to speak.   by the end of the year, i went to class each day, studied, etc. but did not bust my ass as i had first semester. what was the point? well, i guess the point was that busting my ass earned me the thorougly mediocre grades i had received the previous semester. not busting my ass earned me what i got this semester: two D's, a C-, and a B-. now the academic surveilance is on my ass, the meetings with the dean where i must kiss ass to avoid being dismissed from a school i loathe. to walk like a ghost through the halls hating everyone i see while i know that i am the last of the original four to remain there. my other two good friends have since dropped out. i am alone, and i am about to be kicked out.   i have no ambition, no drive, no desire, nothing except the ability to enjoy life when i am not defined by my grades, achievements, or job title. yet given the climate of american society, i am not given that ability. most people have no hobbies. their life is work, the television, shopping, their spouse (whom they usually do not love) and their children (into whom they pour all of their thwarted desires). if i didn't have to 'have a career', if i didn't have to deny every aspect of my personality, brain, and happiness in order to make money and have to do this for 8 to 10 hours a day for the next forty years of my life, i would be a very happy person. i have no external need for validation from this world. i do not care what others think of me. but in this world you are FORCED to care about what others think of you: because if you DON't, you don't have a job and then you starve.   the only thing i could succeed at is living a life of leisure--that and volunteer work; the only job i have been able to hold donw.
