						   I've started e-mailing a guy I've meet over the internet.  His picture's really cute and he says in his profile that he's into fantasy.  I put 'Buttercup seeks her Westley' as my headline to see if people get it and he did! He realised it was from the Princess Bride so you never know, things could happen. Tommy has been really flirty with me.  I was on poker and was in the middle of a coughing fit when he heard me.  He asked if I was OK and I said I had a bad chest at the moment.  He said Doesn't look bad to me.  But that's just TommyI guess.

						   That guy from the other night has had his membership taken away from him!  Martin said that he'd been a pest for a while now and that was the last straw.  I think that makes it 3 I've managed to have barred! Was talking to the new waitress Amanda and when I told her that He dumped me she was like Oh well, you can do much better than him.  And yep I can.

						   Was in work tonight and talking to Debs and Shiraaz about my interview.  He was there as well.  We were just talking about friends when He chipped in 'well most of my mates are in Plymouth, that's why I go there so often.'  I swear I had to bite my tongue to stop myself saying 'Well why don't you make all of us happy and fuck off back there then.'  I really wish I had. Had a bit of a surreal night actually.  I had a piss head punter tell me to get my tits out.  Naturally I complained.  It turns out that he's a brit living in Thailand over here for his daughters wedding and I think that says just about everything that you need to know about him.  The really weird thing was Tommy.  First off he asked if he could rub against me, but then that's just Tommy.  Then later on he told me I was looking beautiful.  I was like, um ok.  I know not to take him seriously because he's a coked up flirt but its nice to hear, especially from someone I do have a little crush on. Felt so horny yesterday.  Am seriously considering giving Matt a call for some no-strings sex.  I know that he'd be well up for it and I'd rather call him than meet some random guy.

						   Have come up with a new theory about people.  Admittedly it's one I came up with while rather pissed but still I think it holds up.  If you ask a person which they prefer cats or dogs they will tell you one or the other.  Each animal represents different character traits that that person values.  A cat person will say they prefer them because they're independent, they don't need anyone to look after them and care about no-one.  These traits are what a cat person looks for in other people. Now a dog person will say they prefer them because they're affectionate and loving.  Unlike cats they need people around them and crave company.  Likewise they'll look for people who are those things. Now cat people and dog people are on a basic level incompatable.  They look for completly different things in a relationship and want different things out of them. So the most important thing you ask someone you fancy isn't 'what sign are you' but rather 'cats or dogs'.  Be prepared for the answer and you'll save yourself alot of heart ache in the future.  Or at least that's my plan from now on!

						   Just had a job interview today.  It's as a PA/Editors Assistant in Croydon which is a lot closer to Wimbledon than the casino and as its a day job means no night bus and no working weekends!  I don't know if I've got it, I properbly haven't, I mean I have no experience working in an office.  Also the company seems to consist of just two blokes sitting in an office and me doing whatever they don't want to.  Oh well, it's got to be better than what I'm doing at the moment, at least I'll be away from Him and the thought of Him and his New Girlfriend.  One of the guys who interviewed me was really cute.  I know I can't think like that, I mean if it's a bad idea shagging a guy you work with when you work with other a hundred people, how bad is it to get off with your boss when there's only you and one other in the office?  Unthinkable. It's bad being at home by myself.  This is when I miss Him the most, when I'm alone and start getting bored.  But I realise now that part of this is loneliness and not wanting Him back.  It really is a case of wanting anyone and He's the person I think about.  The problem is that I need to get out more, not just after my dayshift but on my days off as well.  Oh well am on holiday from Sunday night and am going home to see my family.  At least then I'll have people around me.  Plus Stacey will be back tomorrow so I'll have her for company and the dog as well. I really hope I get the job.

						   Was in the pub tonight with my mate John and other people and it occured to me that i do really fancy him.  The only problem is that he's been with his mrs Lisa for nearly three years.  they've been together since i met them two years ago and before that in glasgow.  She gave up being a lesbian for him so i know what they mean to each other.  i also know that they are having problems at the moment.  they lost twins recently and since then Lisa has been depressed.  Today she asked me if i knew any cure for depression, but like i told her i lived with a depressive mother for years and have no idea what its all about.  I mean like any one I go through my low patches but i get through them.  Part of me can't help thinking that i would like them to split up.  I know its wrong of me to think it but i would definately shag John given half a chance. When i mentioned in the pub that He had a new girlfriend in Plymouth everyone pissed themselves.  When i think about it he isn't even an average looking bloke, i mean he isn't ugly but lets face it, he's not far off.  Have got a job interview tomorrow.  Am nervous but at the same time looking forward to it. I really want to move out of casino's .  I'm sick to it.  In fact I'm already planning my leaving.  I just hope that when i do Les will be able to come.  I think he's one of the best blokes I've ever met and will be really annoyed if he didn't come to my leaving.  So will have to have at least two.  One for the people who have weekends off, like les and Jo and one for my group who have mid-week off.  It may sound greedy but there are so many people I'd like to say good-bye to.  that's if I get the job of course.

						   can't wait until tomorrow.  me and some mates are having a big girlie night out and i am more than ready for it.  think we'll proberbly end up in a club in covent garden.  any place as long as its not Hombres.  Have banned myself from there, the last two times i went i ended up getting back together with Him. the only problem is that He's on dayshift with me tomorrow and usually who ever is working on dayshift will be in the pub.  I really don't want to have Him there tomorrow night, He's the last person i feel like socialising with at the moment.  especially seeing that i might pull!

						   I first time I fell in love I fell hard. I’ve never been a person to do things by half and this was no different. I really didn’t expect it, certainly didn’t want it and had no idea how to cope with it. Especially after he dumped me. We’d been friends for a while until one drunken night at a mates birthday bash we go off with each other. He told me how he’d fancied me for ages and really liked me and while part of me was reluctant to go out with him, feeling that we were better off as friends rather than lovers, in the end I was persuaded to give it a go. I still can’t figure out what it is about him that makes me be unable to get him out of my head. It’s not even like I really fancy him that much. He’s too tall, I’m only 5 foot 3 whereas he’s over 6 foot tall, he’s way too skinny and even though he isn’t even 30 is well on his way to baldness. He’s got gappy teeth and smokes. And yet I can’t forget about him, can’t seem to move on. Part of the problem is the fact that we work together. Not smart to screw the crew I know but these things happen. I should have learned my lesson after the last one but then girls never do, do we? He was a bad one, a psychotic, alcoholic Irish shit who started threatening my family when I stopped answering his calls. After him it took me a long time to trust a man again and look what happened when I did. The next one dumps me for a girl he used to work with. To me that’s worse that dumping me a person he’s just met. It makes me think that I was just a convenience, just a substitute for this other girl and that he was just using me because he couldn’t have her. I know this properly isn’t the case but I can’t help but feel that. I put my heart on the line for him and he squashed it, cast it aside at the first opportunity. Maybe that’s part of the problem, I give myself up too easily, allow myself to be hurt. I know it sounds old fashioned but I’ve never got my head around the concept of sex being something just for fun, to me it’s something to be shared between two people who care about each other and to treat it in any other way cheapens it. I don’t think I ask for much out of a relationship, just to meet someone who’ll cuddle me and hug me, who’ll make me feel special and loved. So far I haven’t found that and I’m starting to doubt that I will. To tell you the truth I’m beginning to wonder if the pains worth it so far I’ve given and I’ve given and all I’ve got in return is shat on from a great height. the real problem is that i have to work with him every day. it's hard and i hate it. because i work in a casino everyone knows my business, knows exactly what happened between us and how much i was hurt. part of me really wants him back and yet another part wishes it had never happened. he was my friend before he was my lover and i miss that. i miss him
