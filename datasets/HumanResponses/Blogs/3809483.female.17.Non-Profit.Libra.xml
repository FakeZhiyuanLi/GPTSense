CLARK!!!!.....lol....anyway...later rush off to meet chewy, went to eat Yoshi...and i gave most of my allowance to that food......=x no more left...engaged with him in a unique conversation.....found out something which makes me think more of this relationship =p....i dunno why, maybe its becos of what he said...hit me in the head....and i'm still thinking what to do.....didn;t feel like talking to him on Mon....so didn;t call him , but he called and i had no choice.....oh yea...i forgot to metioned this, i think he has something for V, cos he knows soooo Much abt her....they should both be together eh...not me....lol.....see these are some facts that make me reconsider....some bloody hacker from Gb changed my Game ID.....i am so mad.....and some friends whom i thought are friends deleted me from the buddylist......i guess i know how true they are.....anyway, studied Phy yesterday, YES! i finally made progress.....i'm going to try my best continue!  So tue......was fine....i had two free periods but was sub with some other periods, nothign interesting happen today....talk to my buddy Chrisy, love her, such a cute ger =)...rush backf rom school....i can;t wait to leave this piece of c***, but hopfully with good results....i really regretted =( so guys better study before u end up like me =x.
