      I thought if I list out everything that's buzzing around my head it might help!  Then again, there's so much I doubt I'll ever manage it....  "If learning involves the use of ICT, it's e-learning" (Dfes UK)  Can the desired learning outcomes drive the technology?  Or will the 'imposed' technology drive the learning?  Thinking out of the box?  Blue sky thinking?  I think it's hard to imagine outcomes until you see what the technology can do.  But the technology should spark off ideas that include, "can it do this as well?", questions.   What is best practice?  What works and what dosen't?  How do we implement the changes?  Teachers  Things to consider: Training, not too much too soon.  I think the best idea is to introduce one new piece of software at a time for a department, but it never seems to work out this way.  There's always the desire to get everything at once, especially if there's money to spend!  How is the technology being used? Can we teach in different ways? Enhanced lessons (doing things that without the ICT would not be possible)?  Can we afford the time (in years!) to develop Schemes of work and evaluate teaching?  What about the stress technology brings to some staff?  Hardware/Software  Data projectors (with AV? DVD/VHS, amps, speakers), docucams, electronic whiteboards (slates, voting), computers in a desk, NETOP Schools, touch sensitive plasma screens, PC's vrs Laptops (lease?), wireless, 24/7 schools, website design/maintainance, assessment, MIS, PDA's, ILS's, resources on line, digital camera's and video, file sizes, backups, a robust and fast network (outsorce technical support? HP, IBM, or in house?), blogging!  Well, there's plenty to think about.  I'm at an e-learning conference tomorrow lead by specialist colleges in Bolton.  I keep hoping I'll attend something that will suddenly cause the light to shine and dawn to break making everything clear!

      e-learning is the new goverment solution to all their problems and meeting their educational needs.  But what's it all about?  As you begin to look closely, you soon realise that there is quite a lot of spin invloved and all the talk is about renaming already idenified systems.  But isn't the 'e' a wonderful thing?  e-confidence, e-school, e-parent, e-bygum!  Find a word and put 'e' infront of it deparment within the dfes is working overtime at the moment and knocking out more 'buzz' words then ever before.  But there is a serious side and as someone who truely believes that teaching and learning has been and will be transformed by the enhancing use of ICT, this blog is about my journey in finding out more.  I am going to attempt to cut through the words to the meat (or soya for any veggies out there) and find ways to move my school, teachers, students and parents on.  Will I avoid the pitfalls?  Can I find a way to transplant a new helpful personality onto my network manager?  All this and more on my next posting!
