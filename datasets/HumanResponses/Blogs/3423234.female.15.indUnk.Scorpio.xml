      As much as I despise the mall with a passion, I owed one of my friends a visit since I unintentionally ditched her the last time I went there.  Hooray for karma.      Well, after spending quite some time in that dump meandering through the crowded, idiot-infested hallways, my friend decided to browse through the Hallmark Store.  After all, Mother’s Day was quickly approaching and children everywhere were feeling the universal need to kiss some parental ass.  So, pretending to be motherless for the night, I decided that if I didn’t sit my lazy ass down soon, I would overexert myself and die.       Not long after looking around for a place to rest, I saw a bench with my name on it.  Actually, it said, ‘fuck u bitch’ on it, but that’s pretty damn close.  With this, I eagerly plopped down and started to engage in one of my favorite cynical pleasures: people watching.       Unfortunately, before I began to take part in the great amusement of labeling people and patronizing their worthless lives in my overactive head, some jackass decided that it was obligatory for him to sit down next to me.  He was decrepit, balding, and smelled of cheese doused in cheap cologne.  For a brief moment, I thought about taking the old bat's cane and thrusting it mercilessly down his throat, but decided against it; he wasn’t worth going to hell over.  Anyway, another man about the same age, around 75 or so, accompanied him.  They might have been partners; I’m not entirely sure.   I did know for a fact, however, that not only was this man intent on killing my own personal space, he was also willing to do the same to the one aspect of happiness I had left—lack of conversation.      “Don’t worry; I don’t bite.”  he stated matter-of-factly with a smirk, taking notice to my blatant discomfort.     My thoughts:  That’s what rapists say.      However, as usual, I did not say what was on mind, but instead managed to squeak out an uneasy “oh, hi.”  The greedy bastard in me was extremely unhappy to be sharing such a fine bench with possible child molesters, but I was too lazy to get up and find another one with the same great view of the typical Whitehall scum.       “This is my friend, Joe.” he introduced in a pseudo-polite manner.  In response to this, I managed another “hi.”  Following this was a long pause, which, I might add, was blissful.     “You know, you should smile more often,"   Cheez Whiz suggested. "You're a pretty girl.”     Okay, why the fuck is this hippie talking to me?  I pondered.     “Why do you say that?”  I inquired, feigning interest.      The old coot then went into this long, boring explanation about some shit that I wasn’t giving my full attention to.  I think this banter had something to do with the muscles in your face and how frowning gives you wrinkles, or something equally asinine to that extent.        What a superficial bastard.   I thought.       I don't think this saggy-skinned douche had any right give me advice since he was no Mr. America himself with his poor complexion, huge nose, and coffee-stained teeth…but who am I to judge?  Wait, what am I saying?   Judging is awesome.       So, what’s my point in telling you this tale?        I’m sick of strangers striking up a conversation with me.  What makes them think that I give a damn about whatever it is that they have to prattle on about?  Inconsiderate fucks like this just ruin my entire day. What’s even better is that they then have the audacity to ask how my day is going, as if their incessant babbling is making it any less terrible.  If you don’t honestly give a damn about my day, then why waste your breath by asking?  And speaking of stupid questions, I especially hate it when complete strangers ask me for the goddamn time.  If you want to know the time, do the logical thing and wear a watch; otherwise, leave me the hell alone.   Yet another type of stranger that pisses me off is the type of fool who passes you while you’re walking through a hallway or down a street.  Doesn’t it just grate on your nerves how they smile at you just because you’re there?  You don’t have to acknowledge my mere existence. Wipe off the cheesy fake grin, and get the hell on with your pathetic life.  Enough with the bullshit.      Why are these aforementioned gestures considered examples of common courtesy?  If anything, one would find them to be rude and annoying as hell.  These people are just little unnecessary nuisances interrupting my already shitty day.       Think I’m cold and antisocial?  You might just be right.

       After browsing through Xanga’s vast collection of shitty BlogRings, I’ve decided to fabricate a few of my own, which people could actually be damn proud of joining for a change.  Enough of those “ANARCHY IS A WAY OF LIFE!!!1” and “DIS IS FO DA GHETTO PEOPLES” BlogRings, it’s high time we put these associations to a distinct purpose:  mocking and abominating all things that are, in my correct opinion, asinine.     Down Wit Ebonics:  Speaking English the way it was meant to be spoken is not a difficult task.  I don’t care what your personal reasons are for speaking in this patronizing fashion; you sound like an uneducated moron.  Some advice: open your mouth a tiny bit more and formulate words correctly, you lazy-ass bastard, or don’t speak at all.  Well, at least not with me.  If you agree that we should make all Ebonics-speaking people learn proper English, join this damn BlogRing.     Get those fucking maroon and gold pom-poms out of my face: This is my “Anti Whitehall High” BlogRing.  I think it’s about time for one of these because, to be frank and simple-minded, our school sucks ass.  Out of the 1,200 students who attend this shoddy institute, I can almost tolerate ten of them.  The keyword there is almost.  How can a person have school spirit if their school is among the poorest and drug infested in the state?  The truth is Whitehall would rather spend money on the sporting events for the steroid-taking jocks than on beneficial electives and a decent curriculum.  In fact, I was planning to tear our school apart in an upcoming rant of mine, so I won’t go into any major details. However, if you say ‘fuck Whitehall,’ feel free to join this BlogRing.     I don’t laugh because you’re different; I laugh because you’re a fucking freak: Dedicated to anyone who loathes those pierced, tattooed, spiky-haired assholes who listen to inane bands such as Good Charlotte and Blink 182, this BlogRing is a coalition against all of those who claim to be different by dressing solely in black and wearing chains, buttons, and colorful plastic jewelry.  If you ever had the urge to tear the lip ring right off of an aforementioned imbecile, this BlogRing is for you.     Pass the Pasta, Porky: Like to eat cake?  Particularly fond of stuffing your face with buttery muffins directly in front of those obnoxious Atkins dieters just to watch them squirm like a priest in a kindergarten classroom?  Sick of those fat, carb-counting fuckers?  I sure as hell am.  In fact, I absolutely hate those Atkins ninnies who are convinced that eating bacon and burgers will transform them into some sort of a sex god, when all they’re doing is turning themselves into walking heart attacks.  Be a proud carb-eater, and join this BlogRing.     So, there you have ‘em, children--my four BlogRings.  I undoubtedly would have thought up some more, but thanks to the wonderful people at Xanga, they only allow four BlogRings per person.  The bastards.      Until next time, readers.

      Okay, time to offend about half of the teenage population with one simple sentence:       You are not in love with your boyfriend/girlfriend/sex object.     It utterly disgusts me how most people claim they are “in love” with their so-called significant other.  The next moron who expresses said declaration will be graciously rewarded with an all expense paid trip through a window of a three story building.  Make that a closed window.  I can’t take these misguided children any longer.       Featured below is my stereotypical example of an ordinary teenage love.  (Yes, I imagine these characters talking in the same fashion in which they write--uneducated.)     (Scene – An “off da hook” party.)     Jock-type guy (a.k.a. Jackass):  Hey, gurl, wuts ur name?  (Casually rolls up sleeve in order to reveal his enlarged bicep.)     Cheerleader-type prep (a.k.a. Thick Headed Bimbo):  *Insert trendy, annoying name here*      Jackass:  Kewl.  You’re mad hott, wanna be mah gurlfriend?      Thick Headed Bimbo:  (Twirls hair.)   I dunno…are u on the football team?     Jackass:  Ya, I’m the quarterback; everyone loves me!     Thick Headed Bimbo:  Great!  Let me just reapply mah lipstick, and then we can go fuck in the bushes!     Jackass:  Sweet!     Aw, how adorable, it’s mating season for the intellectually inept.  Now excuse me while I blow shit out of my nose.     Sadly enough, most relationships are based on superficial qualities such as the above example.  What good is it to be involved with someone if your only motives include elevating your social status, getting laid, or proving a point?  With that previous inquiry, let me pose another one upon you so-called lovers:       What are you really in love with?     My best guess to the answer of this question is that most people are merely in love with the idea of being in love.  They desire to experience this emotion so much that they end up feeling only what they want to feel, and don’t realize that being in a relationship with someone doesn’t necessarily equate love.  Truthfully, love is frequently mistaken for infatuation or lust, which, therefore, makes the expression ‘I love you’ a blatantly false claim.       So, kiddies, don’t spout off some ignorant shit just because that’s what another person wants to hear.  Simply said, just keep your damn mouth shut if you don’t mean what you say.   You should know better.  Also, study the difference between infatuation and love.   I’ll aid in this learning experience by defining the two words for you:     Infatuation:  A foolish, unreasoning, or extravagant passion or attraction.     Love:    To have a deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude towards a person.     If you possess at least the slightest bit of comprehension skills you should be able to differentiate between the two.  Therefore, now that you’ve been enlightened as to the difference, you no longer have an excuse for confusing those terms.       Before I wrap up this rant of mine, and before you all spam my site and write me lame, immature e-mails that label me as a “DUM FUCK WIT NO LIFE” and a “MAD UGLY CUNT,” I would like to point out that I’m not saying that it’s impossible to fall in love with someone during your teenage years.  However, it’s fairly improbable if you’ve only been drooling over some idiot from afar or have been together with someone for a month or so.  You kids already proved that you don’t know love is, so stop making yourself look like more of a fool, let alone a liar.      I still hate teenagers.

      Why is it that every time our immature class is forced into the auditorium for some bullshit assembly, I end up sitting next to some asshole with nauseating body odor?  It makes me sick.       Literally.       I can’t even pretend to concentrate, let alone sleep with this putrid odor lurking around in the atmosphere.  My whole time during these tedious presentations is always spent burying my head in my hand; frantically trying to gasp for some clean air, as the few unfortunate surrounding others do all that they possibly can to control their poor stomachs. My heart truly goes out to them, I might add (except a certain few, that is, they can all rot in hell right next to that whore Kirsten Dunst).       Furthermore, how much money do I have to pay this filthy pig to take a fucking shower?  Showering a mere three times a weak certainly does not cut it. Use deodorant, at least, you slob; I’ll even buy the damn thing for you.  However, I’ll only do so if you promise to get out of my range of smell…permanently. And if you refuse to leave my presence, I’ll be compelled to ruthlessly burn your foul body with a significant amount of incense (the strawberry kind; it smells respectable).  That way, we’ll take care of both problems, namely, no more smell, and no more grimy asshole.       Simply put, I loathe people who don't bathe on a regular basis.

      It’s peculiar.  Today, three undeserving people of my time asked me the same ignorant question:     “Is there anything in this world that you do like?”     Honestly, I have never given this question much, if any, thought at all until now, but I’m sure there has to be something I enjoy in this fierce, hellish world of ours.  On to the list!        Things I May Actually Tolerate (in no particular order):     1.  Food.                            As bizarre as it may sound, food is an absolute passion of mine. Besides providing you with imperative nutrients, which keep your ass alive, food also serves many more subtle functions such as comfort, stress release, and, above all, a delightful taste that leaves with a pleasing warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  The only drawback is the possibility of unwanted weight gain.  However, since I have already stated that food is comforting, only consuming more of it will make you feel better about the pounds you’re unwillingly packing on.  Thus, food can solve all of your problems.       2.  Anime, Jpop/Jrock, and other nonsensical crap hailing from Japan.                             I suppose I just have a natural affinity to this junk. I have yet to understand the reason, but it just seems to put me a lighthearted mood.  Subliminal messages, I presume.      3.  Ranting.     This may very well contradict the original question, but I enjoy ranting about things and expressing my usually biased opinions to other equally biased people.  It helps me vent my pent-up anger and hatred about society and people in general.  A good argument or ranting once in a while can be considered quite a healthy hobby actually.     4.  T.V./Computer.                 What’s a better activity than sitting on your fat ass while wasting yourself in front of a screen?  These little luxuries go a long way.  They provide entertainment, relaxation, and, in the computer’s case, an easy method of communication and harassment involving total strangers.  A wonderful invention, indeed.      5.  Laura.                 What list would be complete without perhaps my favorite person?  Without Laura, I would literally plummet myself off of a bridge into the massive pit of speeding traffic below.  She shares all of my same views, ideals, and opinions on just about everything imaginable.   I’m trying not to make this sound cheesy because we both hate that crap, so it is probably in my best interest to stop going on about her now.         So, there you have it, pubescent boys and girls.  I do happen to like some things.  So you can safely conclude that I do have a soul after all.  And they call me a heartless bitch from hell…

      My face is pale, my hair is barely brushed, and I am voluntarily dressed like a slob with absolutely no fashion sense whatsoever.  All in all, I basically look like hell.  But this isn’t any different from how I look any other day.       I just don’t see the need to primp myself.  Why should I take roughly an hour out of my hectic morning to style my hair, put on a nice, clean-looking outfit, slap some pore-clogging makeup upon my ugly face, and embellish myself with annoying, expensive jewelry?  I’m only going to school.  And, believe me, there is absolutely no one there to impress (unless you happen to like idiotic, whiny, teenage brats with no personality).       Furthermore, how can people honestly believe that makeup looks exceptionally gorgeous? Sure, it may prove to appear presentable worn in very small quantities, but how often do you see it worn in said way?  I most commonly observe people wearing excessive amounts of mascara and blush, lipstick that is either too dark or too light, and eye shadow consisting of sickly colors such as blue, purple, or black.  This isn’t a “style.”  This is looking like a damn circus clown.    Weird colors on one’s face shouldn’t attract people. At most, it should make others want to run away and hide.  People, do our stomachs all a favor, and just leave your faces alone.  If you look ugly without makeup on, chances are, you’ll look equally ugly with it on.  Stop trying to mask your hideousness because, trust me, it will never, ever work.  Ogre.        Aside from makeup, clothing styles are another issue.  I am utterly disgusted with you skinny bitches wearing excruciatingly tight clothes.  How can you possibly breath comfortably?  Also, I’m absolutely positive that I should not be able to count someone’s ribs through their clothing.  I know you’re sickly skinny; you don’t have to prove it to me. With that said, take off your kid sister’s shirt, and put on one that actually fits, you idiot.  As repetitive as this question may be, who are trying to impress? -- some unintelligent pervert in the back of your Spanish class?  Is it your little preppy friends?  My advice to these fools:  Stop trying to be a teen slut, and grow up at least a little bit. Also, stop letting people run your lives by making your decisions for you.      Imbeciles.     This obsession with appearance can be blamed on the parents, the media, or the individuals themselves.  Undoubtedly, in my opinion, the media is to blame.  They attempt to convince everyone that dressing, looking, and acting a certain way is the only method of being accepted in our society.  They persuade you to believe that being 110 pounds and a size one is ideal.  They want you to put makeup on your drab faces with the intent of heightening your physical appearance; they strive to make you desire soft, silky hair and straight, white teeth.  They want to make you feel inferior in every possible way.     And they do a damn good job.       Yes, every day they manage to sucker some self-absorbed sap into their superficial way of thinking.  How?  Because we live in a society full of weak-minded idiots.  People see something, and they want it.  Not because said object is a necessity, mind you.  People just want to be “mad cool,” and they will do anything to achieve that, no matter what the cost.      However, there is absolutely no use in trying to look like a Barbie™.  If people only like you due to the fact that you have a pretty face and flawless body, they don’t necessarily like you for who you genuinely are.  And that’s a damn shame because we know that people like this have so much intelligence going for them.  (Sarcastic pause.)     Anyway, if you like proving to the world that you’re an egotistical, self-serving moron by wearing this shit, I’m not going to try to convince you otherwise.  You most likely wouldn’t be able to comprehend my point of view, anyway.  If only you would put as much time into your studies as you do into perfecting your appearance, maybe we could actually have an intelligent, worthwhile conversation.      That's a strong emphasis on “maybe.”

      People are fucking disgusting.      Today, after an entirely too long gym class, I hurried into the locker room only to unfortunately come across the nauseating site of a used tampon carelessly flung onto the wet floor beside the water fountain.  Let’s not forget that the trashcan was only a mere four feet away.  I guess walking a few extra steps for sanitary’s sake would take too much time and effort, wouldn’t it?     Not even I can compete with that vast amount of utter laziness.         And Speaking of revolting habits regarding menstruation…     urlLink        Isn’t this painting lovely?   I’m not being sarcastic, here.   I really think this is a beautiful painting that deserves a lot of credit.   However, paint is not exactly the material used to complete this potential masterpiece.  The main ingredient:         Menstrual blood.       Now let’s take the time to pause, reflect, and just say, “eww…”     Eww.     It does make you think, though.  In fact, a plethora of unanswered questions frantically stew in my mind:     -Why?!     -Was she in such a shortage of tampons and/or other sanitary, feminine products that she had to use her canvas?     -How the hell did she collect all of that blood?     -Why not just use paint?  She’d obviously make some money off of them if she did so.  Seems logical to me.     -Why menstrual blood?  I think the slitting of the wrists would be much more practical.     -Once again, why blood at all?     -…Why did I refer to six questions as a plethora?        Some of these questions can be answered with only one word:       Feminism.     Feminists annoy the hell out of me.  Why don’t they just shut the hell up and keep their lousy womanhood to themselves instead of exposing it to the world as if the public really gives a damn?       No one does.       In fact, I believe these feminists are wasting their time in trying to prove that women should be held in as high regard as men are.  Not that I believe men should be held in higher regard, mind you.  I believe all humans are equally detestable no matter what their sex happens to be.  And, sorry, but different races, body types, sexes, or styles will never be accepted equally in our conceited, superficial society.  Stop protesting the inevitable.      So, basically, these feminist idiots couldn’t make a difference in society to save their meaningless lives.     To sum up, feminists are morons, menstrual paintings are stupid and pointless, and…always remember to throw your goddamn tampons in the garbage.

      Who the fuck brings a three-year-old child to an "R" rated movie?  Well, some idiot comfortably seated behind us stuffing his pudgy, irresponsible face with popcorn did.   And what a devilish little brat this kid was!  At one point, he (or she...I couldn't tell; it was dark) got up from where it was sitting and started running around as if the place were goddamn circus.  Not that that's the child's fault, I might add.  He shouldn't even have been dragged there in the first place. Parents these days...  Anyway, about twenty minutes ago, I just returned home after seeing The Passion of the Christ with my wonderfully eccentric comrade, Laura.  God, words cannot even begin to describe how powerful this  movie is.  You'd have to be Satan himself to not shed a tear during this awesome film.  We all left the theater dumbfounded, speechless, and uncontrollably shaking.  Mel Gibson definitely achieved groundbreaking superiority with this one.  But, like I said, words simply can't describe.  You have to see this film for yourself, and I highly recommend that you all do.  Maybe it will shine a light on your dull-as-dirt lives.

      I’ve had this Xanga for about a month now, and I’ve been getting some feedback on it from a lot of different people (some of which I don’t even know).  The repetitiveness gets quiet annoying after a while, so I’ve decided to reply to all of your common questions and comments right here in hopes that you will all shut up unless you have something specific and/or meaningful to say about it.     The Good:     “Sarah, your site is so funny.  I love it so much that I even put it in my favorites.”     Well, to put it bluntly, you have terrible taste.   I’m happy you like it, but my site sucks.  It’s neither funny nor entertaining, and I don’t see why you waste your time reading it.  Go do your homework or something; you’ve proven yourself to be in need of some knowledge.     “You’re a good writer.”     Hah.  I have the writing skills of a twelve-year-old on acid.  Don’t compliment my horribly mediocre, amateurish writing.  You obviously don’t know what you’re talking about.     “That’s a nice picture.  You’re pretty.”     First of all, you’re wrong.  I’m ugly.  In fact, I’m so ugly that I even disgust myself.  That’s how hideous I am.  And I don’t even care what I look like.    Second, you’re not supposed to be commenting on my picture.  It’s only there because I don’t know what else to put in its place. If that’s your deciding factor on whether to read my shit or not, leave right now.  If anything, that picture should scare you away.        The Bad:     “Your site sucks.”     Did I hold a gun to your thick head and make you read every single word of it, kiddo?   No?  So, don’t complain.     “You’re obviously some crazy, depressed, schizo bitch.”     I will admit that I do have my pet peeves.  I will also admit that I’m not the happiest or nicest of people, but that doesn’t make me a crazy schizo.  Bitch, maybe.  You’re the type of person that makes me the way I am, so either deal with it, or don’t read it.     “You need to get laid.”     (I shit you not.  Someone actually said this to me.)    If you’re trying to piss me off, you’ve said the right thing.  Just because I wrote some garbage about people being idiots means that I need to get laid? Yes, that will relieve all of my pent-up frustration…    Furthermore, I’m younger than some of you think.  (Yes, I lie about my age all the time.) Therefore, it’s safe to conclude that I’m not having sex.  Even though a lot idiotic people my age do, you should still know that I’m not a fucking whore.  I hate whores, goddamn it.  Also, you’re the one who brought up the subject of getting laid, so I think the person who needs to get laid is you, my friend.          The Random:     “When are you going to update again? Are you slacking off?”     What the fuck?  …OF COURSE I’m slacking off.  You should know me by now.  Also, don’t tell me when to update my site. I’ll do it whenever I goddamn feel like it.  I’m not always in the mood to write.  I wish I were, and I constantly tell myself to update, but if I post when I’m not in the mood, you’ll get a shitty entry.  Interesting entry, or shitty entry...  It’s your decision.      “You’re an animal abuser.”     No shit. I’m so happy you can read.   Just because I wrote about how I abused my disgusting dog once, doesn’t mean I do it every day.  In fact, it was only that one time.  It’s not like I come home from school, immediately pick up my dog, punt him across the house, and stand there like an idiot drooling and laughing while he’s pleading for mercy.    I would never.     “I think you’re a racist.”     Well, you know what I think?  I think you may be on to something, there…  No, but really, I’m not exactly a racist.        “Those last few entries weren’t really funny.”     Thank you for that blue-ribbon advice, O guru of rants.  I think you’ve given me a newfound inspiration.        Jackasses.

      It was only a few short weeks ago when I was hurriedly walking through the prep-infested, intelligence lacking, overpriced shopping lair of doom when, out of the corner of my eye, I thought I spotted two men tightly grasping each other’s hands as they turned in to The Gap.     “Maybe I’m seeing things.   Hopefully, I’m seeing things.”     I immediately did a double take, and haplessly concluded that, indeed, these two misguided men were among the fagot population.       You’ve probably gathered this by now, but let me just come right out and say it for all of the retards out there that can’t draw a conclusion:     I don’t like gay people.     And with that said:      I fucking detest gay marriages.     But before I go into the gay marriage episode, let me start by giving my opinion on why homosexuals annoy the hell out of me.     They bother me for many reasons, but it’s not the fact that they’re attracted to the same sex; I know that they can’t help the way their mentally diseased mind processes.  Yes, I believe that homosexuals suffer from an illness, rather than it being just a sexual choice.  I feel that the same sex shouldn’t be an option, let alone a preference.  The human body was designed to have a hormonal balance for the purpose of attraction to the opposite sex.  Therefore, you must have an imbalance if you’re not attracted in such a way.  With that conclusion drawn, I think we should administer some sort of medication and/or psychological therapy to these people to make them function like humans were intended to.  This also explains why people “turn” homosexual.  You don’t just wake up one day and decide to live your life that way.  Something must have gone wrong in their heads, eh?     Simply put, it’s just not natural.  I don’t want to bring the Bible and God into this, but it’s inevitable.  I’m sure you’ve already heard the cliché:     God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.      It’s true, though.  If God intended people to be gay, he wouldn’t have made two sexes.  There are also numerous verses in the Bible depicting the immorality of it.  (Leviticus 18:22, among many others.).        This leads me to the subject of gay marriages.  Like my friend Laura stated, marriage is a sacrament of HOLY matrimony.  We’ve already established that it’s a sin; so why the fuck would you label yourself as a hypocrite in that way?       Interesting honeymoon that would be.       *Shudder*   Fucking disturbing…     Like I said though, they can’t help it.  To each their own…       (Note:  If you’re a fucking atheist, don’t even waste your breath or time by arguing this.  I don’t need moral advice from someone too stupid to not believe in anything.)     But, by far, the worst of these people would have to be the bisexuals.  These freaks CHOOSE to fuck people of the same sex, and they claim it’s acceptable because everyone is a little bisexual, after all.     What a load of bullshit.       I never once was attracted to another female.  With that, observing that a girl is pretty does not make me attracted to them, as some people seem to think.  It’s the same for a male (since I’m a female); I can say that a guy is good-looking without being attracted to him.  So, not everyone is a little “both ways.”       Idiots.     To wrap it all up, I don’t mind homosexuals because they just can’t help it. However, if they wanted to change, they could(and should).  I just find it to be utterly immoral and repulsing.  As for gay marriages, it’s completely unnecessary.  And, I find bisexuals fucking stupid morons who find it entertaining and “cute” to play with people of the same sex (most common in immoral, immature girls).  I’m not saying homosexuals are bad people – they’re not.  I just don’t respect their morals and beliefs.

       It’s 3:37 a.m.     Tonight is one of those I-can’t-sleep-no-matter-how-hard-I-try nights and I’m rather pissed, to say the least.      It all started out fairly normal, though.  I strolled upstairs around 9ish as I heard my dad calling, “sleep well” to me from a few steps below.       “Yeah…” I thought to myself sarcastically, “With my luck, I’ll be tormented with the unpleasantness of insomnia tonight.”  I made my merry way into my small, blue room, and, as usual, immediately stepped onto the chair by my desk in order to reach my lazy, indolent cat, which was comfortably nestled in the sheets of my loft bed.  I picked him up, threw him down gently to the floor, hopped down, and continued to close the door behind him.  That damn cat sure as hell would not puke in my room tonight.  I walked to the other side of my room, turned off my lamp, and climbed the ladder up and into my bed.  I hid myself under the covers and turned on some, in my opinion, relaxing music to drift off to.  I rested my heavy head happily on my cozy pillow with the contentment in knowing that I would be able to shut myself out from the cruel world for a small collection of hours.  With that, I closed my eyes and surrendered myself to the unconsciousness falling over me.      Well, almost.  My mind abruptly awoke due to the incessant tapping of an unknown source.  At first, I thought the easiest option would be just to ignore it.  However, the monotonous tapping noise failed to cease.      Tap…tap…tap…     Understandably slightly agitated by this nuisance, I placed my headphones dutifully on my ears in hopes to drown out the tapping.  No luck.  Even with them on, I could still hear it faintly.  I turned up the volume.  Ah, the tapping sound seemingly disappeared. After about three peaceful songs or so with my Sarah McLachlan CD, the battery on the piece of crap player decided to perish, forcing me, once again, to listen to that goddamn tapping noise.     Tap...tap...tap...     Even more enraged, I whispered in a half scream as to not wake anyone:     “What the FUCK is that?!”     Forcefully, I turned myself around, quickly climbed down a few stairs of my ladder, and jumped down the rest of the way down onto the brown, thin carpet below.  I then began to search my room for the root of the annoyance.  I was determined.      Now, if you have ever seen my room, you know it isn’t exactly very large.  It can even be compared to the size of fucking prison cell.  Hell, it is a fucking prison cell, but it was my fucking prison cell, and that’s all that matters.  Anyway, looking through this room was like searching for homosexual in a gay bar.  Easy.  So, obviously, it didn’t take me very long.   Unfortunately, to my surprise, I couldn’t find what was causing the tapping, and I was definitely not going to search the whole entire house just to find it.       Defeated, I slumped into my chair, and began scribbling some nonsense on the blank piece of paper in front of me.  After that got boring, I decided to write down the enthralling experience of the insomnia, which is tonight, and turn it into an update for you bastards to laugh at.       It is now 4:41, and I still haven’t a clue as to what the tapping is.  However, I do know that it’s easier to stay up the rest of the night than to fall asleep for about an hour and wake back up.  So, staying awake seems to be my only logical option.   On that note, I think I’ll go waste myself in front of the T.V. while you’re, most likely, blissfully asleep in your warm, comfortable beds.      I am hating all of you right now.

      Them Twinkies got your ass gettin' fat fat Them cookies got your ass gettin' fat fat That paint got your ass gettin' fat fat Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat fat  In the gym I see your ass up on the stair master But you got it on level 2, bitch go a little faster Look girl I ain't gon lie, I'll tell you how I feel They should hand cuff your big ass to the treadmill You wanna work out now, cause you know its gettin' hot And your big ass fin to pop all up out the halter top Find the right chick, wearing some tight shit, and it's on See your ass wearing some tight shit, we like "She wrong"     -50 Cent        I don’t know whether I should laugh at this stupidity, cry, or shoot myself in the head due to it.  Actually, I’m slightly leaning towards the latter, but that’s not really the point I’m trying to convey.  The point is:     This sick bastard is actually thinking of running for mayor in his Connecticut hometown.     He’d have my vote.     Why would anyone ever even consider electing a man who is known for being materialistic, perverted, superficial, and violent for any government position?  Does this guy even know what a mayor is or does?  Further, if his hometown is as ghetto and fucked up as he claims it to be in his “songs,” what makes him think that he can do a better job than any willing intelligent person in improving it?  He was part of the problem in the first place by being a fucking crack dealer.  The only thing he can possibly contribute to the city would be more strip joints, porno shops, and, of course, free crack and bling bling for all. What an inspiration to those citizens, the dissolute man is.       And I don’t know about you, but I would never trust a man who couldn’t speak a full sentence without using the word “bitch” at least one time in it. Or is just unable to speak a full sentence, for that matter.  There are other adjectives out there, fuckface. You might be able to comprehend that if you picked up a book other than The Complete Collection of America’s Most Wanted Criminals once in a while. Don’t worry, though; you’ll be in there one day.

      Why do people unceasingly insist on chatting with me while I’m absorbed in something else as if I care what they have to say?  Sorry, but I don’t.  I really, really don’t.      I’m not your goddamn therapist, people.   I don’t care how riveting your day was; I don’t care what horrible oddity happened to you, and I sure as hell don’t care how it made you feel.  Save it for Oprah, sucker, I’m far too insensitive and busy to take your insipid thoughts and feelings into consideration, especially while I’m doing something in my free, personal time.       According to me, quietness is one of those rare pleasures that one should cherish immensely.  For instance, if you observe that I am sitting alone, either lost in my own thoughts or doing some seemingly pointless task, don’t assume that I am lonely and looking for someone to rescue me by striking up some witty, remarkable conversation because I, in no way, do.  In fact, I find you to be extremely rude, annoying, and a terrible waste of oxygen.  Save it for someone who actually cares.     Oh, wait.  No one does.       In closing, just shut the fuck up when I’m obviously doing something unless you want me close your lips for you via staple gun.

      Words cannot fully express how much I hate Valentine’s Day.  Not because I’m single, mind you, it’s because of the sappiness and, of course, the blatant idiocy involved with it.       First off, Valentine’s Day shouldn’t even be considered as a valid holiday.  The story of St. Valentine has absolutely nothing to do with the common distribution of millions of dozens of expensive roses, the devouring of fattening, yet enticing chocolate, or the act of falling in love with some lonely, horny, pathetic sap because he showered you with said gifts.  Let’s cut the crap right now.   The purpose of this “holiday” is to honor the Catholic Saint, Saint Valentine.  Did you catch that “C” word in there, readers?  Catholic.  Therefore, it is a CATHOLIC holiday, and should be only be celebrated by such people.       However, this is just not the case.  Those Greeting Card bastards at Hallmark were contemplating this unfortunate turnaround for quite some time.  Yeah, I’ll bet they were sitting there in their expensive plush chairs, using their cunning marketing skills, and wondering to themselves:       Now, how can we turn this apparent pointless day completely around in order to sucker everyone out there into buying our shit products?       And with that thought, Valentine’s Day was born, and people have been going gaga over it ever since.         Aside from this day being completely blown out of proportion, it gives people an excuse to act all lovey-dovey towards one another.  Are these fools trying to make me puke?  Because I will, and, believe me, I won’t hesitate to do it directly on them, either.  That’ll teach ‘em not to display their pathetic acts of affection in a public place.  No one wants to see that shit, especially the many ones out there who are lonely and single.  And that brings me to my next point.  Why did they make a day just for couples?  Couples should celebrate their love every day, not just on February 14. They totally disregarded every person without a significant other.  To put it simply, they make a hell of a lot of people feel like crap because they are greedy jackasses.      To conclude, Valentine’s Day is just a work of fiction created in order to squeeze some money out of you thickheaded, foolish individuals who just happen to be in love.   I hope you choke on your $20.00 box of candy, asshole.

       Here’s a random, completely-out-of-my-ass topic for you:     Nudists.        Now that I have your undivided attention, I think these freaks are fucking stupid.    What pisses me off in particular is how they claim that the practice of wearing absolutely nothing is  “liberating” and “natural.”  Well, here’s some news:  It isn’t.  Just think about it for a second.  Did you see Jesus bearing it all?  No, of course not.  One of the first things people were concerned about back then was inventing some sort of method of covering themselves.  You know why?  Because not doing so is essentially just as idiotic as tattooing “rape me” onto your hollow, brainwashed forehead is.  Clothes were invented as a method of keeping warm, dry, and clean.  So…why take them off?  I hope these jackasses catch pneumonia and die a slow, horrible death.  Either that, or we should just commit all of them because being this thickheaded is an absolute rarity, don’t you think?  You have to be extremely stupid to practice this form of idiocy.  Even good ol’ “Dubya” can manage to keep his clothes on.  Seriously, what is wrong with these people?   Most “naturists” are old, fat; ugly people with back hair and warts the size of Texas, which, I believe, is not something to show off about. These fools can’t comprehend that no one wants to see their nasty, horny asses. Well, at least I don’t.  So, put it back in your pants, cover up, and stop acting like some retard on crack, you sick, disturbed fuck.

       Am I the only one who thinks this, or is anyone else getting really sick and tired of this Black History Month garbage?   Now, before you go running off to tell everyone what a horrible, self-righteous, racist pig I am, let me finish justifying my point, you sick bastards.      Why is it fair for a whole entire month to be dedicated just to black people, and not whites?   Is it because blacks are the minority?  Or do you think it’s because we ‘owe it to them?’  Hell, no.  It’s because doing so would be considered racist.  Haven’t they ever thought that this special month signifying black pride may very well offend some white people?  Of course not. They don’t believe in racism towards the majority. Furthermore, let’s not forget to mention the fact that most blacks wouldn’t even be free here, in America, without white people.   And another thing, I don’t see a whole month dedicated to the Asians or Middle Easterners in this country.  There’s not even one for the Native Americans!  I think they deserve a month far more than any other race, don’t you?  They were here first, after all.  I believe it’s the least we owe them for taking their land and turning this country into the capitalist pile of shit, which it is today.  I, personally, don’t find the African Americans more special than any other race, and, thus, do not see the need for a month dedicated in such a way.       While we’re on the topic of racism and various races, I have to say that I find racism against whites much more common than in that towards minorities.   I couldn’t even tell you how many times I’ve walked down the hall during school, and overheard comments between people of secondary races that consist of many biased remarks such as, “stupid white girl,” among others.  However, all hell would break loose if someone even did so much as whisper a racist comment in reference to a minority.  Just turn on your T.V., for example.  Have you ever seen a black comedian on any stand-up comedy show?  Well, basically, the gist of their act is to mock and poke fun at white people.  I’m not saying ALL of them do this, mind you, but some of the ones I’ve seen, do.  First of all, this act gets really tedious after a while. Can’t they think of anything more original? If you’re going to call yourself a comedian, get some new material, fool.   And second, it’s obviously hypocritical of them.  Why can they treat us like shit (even in a playful manner), but then become absolutely insane, not to mention sometimes violent, when one makes even the slightest observation towards them?   If they have a problem with whites so much, they should go back to their own country, and stop polluting ours by acting like a bigot.      (I would like to take the time mention that I’m not saying it’s okay for whites to act like this. It’s absolutely not.  Another thing, I, in no way, believe all minorities behave or act in the ways like above mentioned.  I, in fact, couldn’t care less what the color of your skin was or where you came from.  Dye yourself purple, for all I care.  Hitch a ride from Mars.  I don’t hold anything against people because of their nationality.  Well, I’m sure you understand the point I’m trying to make, here.)

      Oh, how I love waking up to the uninvited sound of my cat puking in the morning.  Seriously, I have to wake up to this shit an easy 3-4 times a week, and I’ll tell you:  It’s fucking disgusting. Just merely being awoken pisses me off, let alone having to wake up and clean a pile of guts off the floor.  And that’s just the beginning of the joy associated with these little fuckers.       Have I ever told you the heartwarming story of how I abused my cute, little piss-filled dog?   It’s a rather splendid tale:                 One bright, January morning, I was awoken to the sound of my mother’s voice telling me glorious news.  The Whitehall-Coplay School District was canceled.  Ah, music to my ears. With a newfound contentment, I drifted happily back to sleep.  The next time I awoke was about 11:00 a.m.  Pissed off because it was morning and I was still tired, I dragged my heavy, half asleep body down the stairs and into my kitchen.  A surprise waited for me there.  Not just any surprise, mind you.  It was the ghastly surprise of an oil spill-sized puddle of piss on the kitchen floor.  This is definitely not my favorite chore to start my day out with.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed my dog (Sammy) sitting innocently on the oval-shaped green mat placed underneath my sink.  I immediately put two and two together:       Puddle of piss (which I had to clean up) + Dog =…One really dead dog.     Knowing this, I gave my dog a good, sound kick.  The little shit growled at me.   In response to this, I kicked him again, even harder this time.  He started to growl some more.  Mumbling some obscenities to myself, my anger level steadily increased. In a fit of somewhat unnecessary rage, I chased him around the house while beating him triumphantly along the way with a sick mixture of my laughter and anger-filled screams.   Well…I’ll spare you the other details.  Let’s just say that this pint-sized demon is still afraid of me.   The best part is, Sammy wasn’t actually the one who recklessly urinated on my mother’s floor.  It was my other ill-behaved mutt, Lady.   Well, since Sam did nothing wrong, that labels me as an animal abuser.  Not that that bothers me, mind you.  I still maintain that the little bastard had it coming.         Pets are definitely more of a hassle then they’re worth.  For one, they’re extremely expensive.  The astounding costs of vet bills, food, toys, and other necessities really add up.  Sorry, but I’d rather use that money to purchase a swimming pool so I can drown myself.  It’s better than putting up with that unfavorable nonsense pets bring.   Second, there’s so much time involved with them.  I’m a selfish person; I don’t want to waste my free time caring for something that someone else would be eagerly willing to do.  Another thing, as I have previously stated, they’re repulsing.  If I wanted a drooling, puking, pissing, shitting annoyance, I’d have a kid.  However, I’m fine with a clean, quiet, pet-free home environment, thank you. Don’t try to convince me otherwise.       Don’t get me wrong; I don’t hate animals.  In fact, I completely adore some of them.  Some of them are so damn cute that I want to squeeze them until their eyes pop out of their tiny little heads.   But that’s only because I don’t have to take them home.  It’s all right; I’d rather leave all the unwanted responsibility to you.

      Let’s talk driving age, shall we?  Personally, I think it should be raised.   I’m not saying this just because of my hypocritical hatred towards teens; I really do believe these adolescents today are way too immature to handle being behind the wheel, let alone possessing the responsibility for their own lives and, possibly, someone else’s.  Face it, the average, idiotic 16-year-old spends the majority of his or her free time partying and/or screwing off.  Irresponsible fucks like this really irritate me.  I hate hearing about how they go out, do drugs, and get drunk every damn weekend.   I hear this all the time from numerous people.  What’s even better is how they claim they “had a good time.”   Yeah, there’s nothing more fun than poisoning yourself.  And here’s an idea:  Why don’t we increase the “fun” by getting into a car and colliding it with another vehicle at exceptionally high speeds?   We’re really thinking now.     In addition to the drug use commonly associated with teens, rage issues are also a present problem.  I know because I could be considered one of them.  People just piss me off very easily, as you have probably observed by now.   However, I’ve learned to control it, for the most part.  I need to because I, unlike many others, realize the danger involved.  Being in a car is neither a game nor a toy, but a serious matter. I think a wise thing to do would be to administer some sort of psychological test on people before they become a holder of a driver’s license.  I’m serious; we don’t need psychotic freaks in society, let alone operating a potentially harmful vehicle.      Teens are seriously fucked up nowadays.  I would say that I loathe them even more than the incessantly whiny child.  And these are the future leaders of our country?   Yet another very comforting thought.

      Ah, the Superbowl.  It’s not just a typical Sunday in my house – it’s a full-fledged holiday.   It’s a time when families all across America gather dutifully around the television.  It’s a time for placing bets, partaking in fistfights, and experiencing the rewarding satisfaction of being able to sleep at night knowing of your team's  winnings.  Frankly, it’s a time that makes me want to vomit up my dinner.      I, for one, think this whole thing is quite ridiculous.  In fact, as I sit here, I’m unfortunately hearing the persistent clamor of poor souls who get worked up over this purposeless game.  No, that’s not a misprint …it’s a GAME. A stupid one, I might add.  I suppose I could understand the excitement if you have a shitload of money riding on it.  However, that’s a blatantly foolish thing to do.     Also, I can’t comprehend why people go out of their way to cheer on a bunch of disgustingly overpaid jocks.  These assholes have a big enough ego as it is.   You don’t (and shouldn’t) have to support them.  Face it, most of these football players aren’t even the slightest bit intelligent (come on, they’re playing a game for their living).  They most likely got a free ride through college (getting their asses kissed along the way, of course), made shit grades, got paid an enormous sum of money for kicking a ball around, and yet receive a great amount of praise from millions of people nationwide.  These aren’t idols; they’re steroid taking, half-witted fools who don’t contribute anything to the world except the encouragement of their undesirable morals.  This isn't reason to party.

      One thing that pisses me off far beyond anything else is when people purposely spell things wrong.  I hate it when people IM me and say shit like:    "Yo, wat up?"    They also will replace words such as "the" or "this," with stupid shit like "da" and "dis."    What the fuck is that?   You can't type two extra keystrokes?  Are you that lazy?  Not even I am that lazy!  Christ.  And saying "What's up?" is just as annoying because 95% of the time people respond with 'nothing,' anyway.  Another thing, it seems that just because people are talking via IM, they neglect to use correct grammar and punctuation.  Now, if I'm really in a rush and busy with multiple things, I probably won't punctuate things properly.  However, I usually do make an honest effort to.  If you want me to think that you have at least an ounce of inteligence, you will apply basic English grammar skills to your sentences, and type them into your IM box.  A sentence begins with a capital letter, and ends with a period.  It really is simple being it 4th grade knowledge and common sense.   So, in conclusion, don't IM me if you talk with ghetto lingo, or if you're just plain stupid.  I shouldn't have to learn another language to read your IM's.

      Bathroom Reading:  Books That Make Me Want to Take a Shit:     -Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone  -Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  -Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  -Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  -Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix     Ever since 1999, avid readers of all ages have flocked to the Harry Potter series like it was their second Bible.  Except for myself, that is.  I, unlike thousands of others, can see past the spell-casting, talking-animal idiocy.     Yes, it’s true; out of all the books in this overrated series, I only read thirty-two pages of the first volume before my eyes started to bleed from the stupidity.  What a complete waste of time; seventeen minutes of my life right down the fucking toilet.  In fact, consuming dog shit probably would have been time better spent.  What boggles my mind is that people actually enjoy reading this stuff in its entirety.  600+ pages dripping in wizards and bratty children for what?  A whole weekend wasted, not to mention a forest.     I’m sure you all have one burning question on your mind:  How can I hate this well-loved series if I didn’t even read the books?     Well, aside from kicking puppies, spitting on babies, and being an all-around bitch, I get my kicks from judging a book by its cover.  And Lord, what stupid covers they are.  I don’t know about you, but some ugly, faggot-faced, prepubescent child on the front of any book sporting thick glasses and a wand doesn’t attract my slightest attention.  Bottom line:  The Harry Potter franchise blows because I said it does.  And I’m always right.      One sound reason to hate this aforementioned franchise is the fact that I can’t go anywhere without having Harry Potter propaganda shoved down my fucking throat.  Did you know that at any given point you are about fifty feet away from something flaunting the Harry Potter name?  It’s true; you can find Harry Potter on almost anything these days.  For instance, you have your Harry Potter books, Harry Potter movies, Harry Potter video games, Harry Potter calendars, Harry Potter watches, Harry Potter notebooks, Harry Potter pens, Harry Potter bed sheets, and even your Harry Potter BOXERS.  Hell, Harry Potter geeks would probably wipe their sweaty asses with Harry Potter toilet paper if they had the opportunity.  And let’s face it, these rabid Harry Potter fools are around every corner, and it’s all because of that greedy, money-hungry whore, J.K. Rowling.          Look at that old hag smiling her smug grin.  I bet she sleeps pretty damn well at night on her comfortable, one-of-a-kind $10,000 bed knowing how much money she’s making every second from her so-called “literature” poisoning the clay-like minds of children all over the world.  What’s even better is that this overly creative bitch claims that she never intended for the franchise to be this popular.  That’s the biggest crock of bullshit I’ve ever heard.  If she never wanted Harry Potter to achieve this much fame, she wouldn’t have gotten her books published, let alone approved the marketing of the millions of Harry Potter items.  “I don’t care about the money” my ass.  Greedy skank.     Have you already been inflicted with the chronic obsession with everything Harry Potter?  Need help with restoring those damaged brain cells?  Don’t worry, kiddo; it’s not too late.  Every time you feel the urge to pick up a Harry Potter book just opt for an entertaining Stephen King novel instead; it’s less sugar-coated and much more educational.  Why would you want to read about some magical faggot when you can read about death and destruction to all of mankind?     There’s no argument; Harry Potter is utterly pointless.

      I have a rant on morbidly obese people in the works, but until I get around to finishing it, I’ve decided to update this Xanga o' mine with a second list of things I tolerate, a list of fifty bands that suck, and a rare, one-of-a-kind picture of myself wearing a skirt.  Hopefully this crap will keep you occupied for the time being.  I know you’re enthused.     Now, back by popular demand, more things I like and/or find amusing:     Bank robberies   Cannibalism  Children crying   Cynicism   Death  Drug abuse  Endangered animals becoming extinct   Forest fires  Hate crimes  Lost puppies  Natural disasters  Nuclear war  Old people falling  Pregnant women smoking   Racism  Rape  Sarcasm School shootings   Slaughtering animals for food  Starvation  STD’s  Suicide  Tyranny  Violence     Hah!  I revel in such occurrences...erm, I mean, those things are just abhorrent.       Anyway, it’s time for some more things that piss me off.  Today’s edition:  bands that blow.      50 Shitty Bands in the Mainstream:     A Flock of Seagulls   AFI   Alien Ant Farm   All American Rejects  Barenaked Ladies  Blink 182  Bon Jovi  Bowling For Soup  Brand New   Cradle of Filth   Dashboard Confessional   Dave Matthews Band  Everclear  Good Charlotte  Grateful Dead  Green Day   Hanson   Hatebreed  Hoobastank  Insane Clown Posse  Jimmy Eat World   Korn  Less Than Jake  Limp Bizkit   Maroon 5  New Found Glory  No Doubt  Oasis   Offspring  Papa Roach  P.O.D.  Puddle of Mud   Rage Against the Machine  Savage Garden   Simple Plan   Slipknot  Smash Mouth  Something Corporate   Sublime   Sugarcult   Sum 41  System of a Down   Taking Back Sunday   Thrice   Thursday  U2   The Verve  The Wallflowers  Weezer  Yellowcard     The best of us can agree that music can’t possibly get any more intolerable than that of the above fifty.  In fact, some of these bands are included on this list merely because their names are either stupid and/or spelled idiotically.  For instance, since when was yellow card and bare-naked spelled as one word?  And what the fuck is a Hoobastank?  U2?  Come on!  Spare me your “hip” jargon, and act as if you received at least a high school education.  Oh wait…      What about the rest of the bands featured on the above list? Well, they’re on said list simply because they’re obnoxious, just like the assholes that listen to them.  Most of the aforementioned bands are nothing more than a quartet of whiny, angst-filled teenagers who can’t play their instruments or carry a tune for shit.  If you own any CD's by the above "artists," do yourself a favor and throw them away.  Better yet, grease them up with a generous amount of kerosene and toss them mercilessly into a fire, which you should feel free to roast some marshmallows over.  Burning useless items is always fun, but burning piles of junk AND eating makes it that much better.       Lastly, as promised, I posted a picture of myself dressed up like a preppy bitch.  Feel free to laugh--I find it to be quite funny myself.  I also included a kick-ass picture of my shaggy dog.  He’s even more hideous than I am.

      My dream job:  Telemarketer.  Before you begin to reprimand me for flushing my life down the shitter, just think about it for a minute.  What better way is there to earn a living than by annoying the hell out of people while simultaneously helping humanity with the handy items you're going to sell?  The first and foremost aspect of telemarketing success is achieved by calling your potential customers at the most inopportune time. Usually the hours between twelve and five a.m. will suffice.  The key thing here is to not hang up the phone. Let it ring a little.  The more you let it ring, the more agitated and indignant your customer will become.  When said customer finally picks up the phone, weary-eyed and groggy, proceed to greet them with an overzealous "Hey, Buddy!" or something similar.  After your obnoxious greeting, offer them...nay, make them buy one of your patented items.  Here's a list of the kickass offers I'm going to sell:  The Homicidal Maniac Gift Set:  With this kit, you acquire three lethal items for the price of one.  Package includes machete, semi-automatic pistol, and a noose.  With this gift set and some practice, you too can become one of America's most wanted criminals. Mace Deluxe Deal:  Upon purchasing this great gift idea, you will   receive two items bearing the "mace" title.  Item number one is the morningstar mace, made popular back in medieval times.    This item is great for hurrying along old ladies who walk slowly down the street or for beating dissolute children who won't shut their unruly faces.The second item you receive is the popular tear gas spray known as MACE.   This is ideal for use on pretentious vegetarians and people who make annoying sounds with their gum. Poison Paradise Package:  Has someone stolen your car recently, stood you up, or perhaps looked at you the wrong way?  Give them what's coming to them. Just slip one of the following chemicals into their food, beverage, or onto their toothbrush for some sweet revenge.  This package contains potassium cyanide, arsenic, and botulin toxin, among other chemicals that have been tested on animals. Creative Criminal Kit:  Do you believe that the ever-so popular guns, knives, and poisons have become trite over the years?  Want to evoke death in an innovative way?  If so, this offer is for you.  With patented items such as the electric showerhead, exploding dildo, and the combusting contact lens, you can truly make torture enjoyable again. If your customer refuses to purchase one of the aforementioned awesome packages, kill them.  So, what do you think?  Should I become a telemarketer?  Write me.

      The people who read my Xanga are the most ignorant people I've ever had the misfortune of communicating with.  Of course this does not apply to everyone, but if you stumbled upon my page, took it seriously, and were offended, chances are you're one of said people. I shouldn't have to explain the definition of satire to those of you who believe everything one writes. Furthermore, and since you dumbasses are too imbecilic to infer my point, that's all I have to say on the subject.   In other news, I’ve decided that the following men are the most ingenious people alive.  If you're a feminist, I would like to point out that there are no ingenious women. These are not my opinions, but facts.    This is Maddox, and his balls are HUGE.  Perhaps the manliest man that ever walked this Earth, Maddox is correct about everything.  His caustic wit and remarkable ability to insult anyone and everyone never ceases to amaze me.  He will kick your pathetic ass any day and undoubtedly die laughing afterwards.   If you don’t who this is, never speak to me again.  Come to think of it, never speak to me again even if you do know this god--I hate talking to people.  Anyway, most people know him as Dennis Leary, but I’ve dubbed him as The King of all Assholes.  This man is angry and one of the most cynical, in-your-face bastards around.  We love him for it.    Last, but certainly not least, is my superhero, Stephen Lynch.  This man is funny as fuck with a voice to match.  He may look innocent, but his songs are known for pushing humor over the edge with subject matter that would astound even the most immodest of people.  Buy his CD’s or burn in hell.

      Don't you hate TV shows where the main premise is basically some asshole trying to get laid?  Well, on the specific show I was watching a few nights ago, an asshole teenager was trying to complete said task by offering his whore girlfriend a single red rose as a cheap, pseudo romantic birthday gift. Aw.  What was even more pathetic than the uninspired present was the fact that the skanky bitch was actually delighted to receive it.  The episode came to a close when we found out that the kid's uncreative attempt to woo his girlfriend worked, and they both engaged in some nasty, prepubescent action that night.  Are people this gullible these days?  Everyone knows that flowers are the universal I-didn't-know-what-to-get-you gift. And, I'm right on this one, only inconsiderate bastards force a flower upon someone.  Let me be so kind as to elaborate.  First of all, flowers are a leading cause of allergies.  In turn, before you buy someone a flower, be aware that you're also inadvertently bestowing nasal congestion, watery eyes, and a sinus headache upon said person.  Congratulations, asshole, you and your dirty plant have taken complete apathy and disregard to a whole new level. But let's not forget to mention how flowers have a habit of attracting bees and other charming insects.  You know, unwanted pests go right up there on my list of desired possessions right next to a Kirsten Dunst movie. Speaking of Kirsten Dunst (if you haven't caught the trend by now), I hate her.  Furthermore, flowers don't only come with their own little nuisances, but they also require time, effort (everything besides sleeping requires at least some effort; effort blows), and the tender loving care that an insensitive person, such as me, does not have.  Why should I have to get off my ass every other day in order to water the damn thing when I could be doing something productive such as watching TV instead?  Why do I have to open my blinds to let in some radiation for the piece of shit even though I detest sunlight?   And why the hell should I have to make sacrifices for something that doesn't even show me an ounce of appreciation in return?  I'd rather watch it wither away.  But first, I'm going to shove it up your ass for bringing this burden upon me.  Also, no matter what anyway says, no matter how hard you try to convince me otherwise...flowers are ugly.    It's a blossom on a green stick--nothing more, and nothing worthwhile.  If you want to get me anything on a stick, make it edible.   Look at that.  Meat on a fucking stick.  Could it get any better?   I think not.  So what have we learned here?  For one, flowers are worthless (you can't even eat them).  And, the bottom line:   Don't buy me a flower unless you want a bullet in your balls.

      Statistics claim that 85% of Americans sing in the shower.  After doing the math, the aforementioned fact approximates to 249,800,326 people nationwide who can't keep their fat mouths shut--even while bathing.  If you're one of those pussies who sing in the shower, allow me to personally rip out your throat and shove it up your pretentious ass right now.  I don't know what it is about running water and nudity that compels people to break into song like Liza Minelli, but it's annoying as hell.  Is it so hard to wash your filthy body without the obnoxious sound effects?  Here's a hint:  People can hear you; shut the fuck up.  Come to think of it, what compels people to sing at all?  What do they have to sing about, and why are they so goddamn happy?   I've seen their kind--I know they're miserable just like the rest of us; they're just too damn scared to admit it.  They're not fooling anyone with their off key songs and distorted melodies.  How can you stop the incessant commotion?  Easy. Inject the desired singer with a generous amount of streptococcus bacteria.  Their vocal cords will begin to swell immensely, thus resulting in the cessation of all vocal activity.  In some cases, if you're lucky, the patient will die from the infection, therefore rendering them permanently incapable of inflicting further annoyance upon you. That'll teach the inconsiderate bastard to keep quiet.   Don't sing...ever.

      Okay, I’m immensely sick and tired of these little emo pieces of shit running around with their heads half way up their deserved-to-be-beaten asses.  There’s nothing I want more right now than to hose said people down with turpentine, staple gun their necks (and testicles, if present) to a telephone poll and ruthlessly burn their pathetic bodies to a crisp.  If there’s anything left over after the aforementioned burning, I will host a dinner party at my house.  You bring the champagne.  Just in case you have no life outside of Star Trek or masturbating to mental images of the thirty-five-year-old prostitute next door, an emo kid is a pseudo-intellectual, and is also usually self-diagnosed as depressed. Further, you may have an emo motherfucker on your hands if they normally wear layers of peculiar black clothing, heaps of dark makeup, and thick-framed black glasses solely because it’s the trendy thing to do. I’m sure everyone is familiar with at least one emo brat, or as I like to call them, immature egotistical pussies.  Yeah, we all know them.  They’re the jackasses who walk slowly in the hallway for the sole purpose of looking as if they’re deep in thought; they’re the freaks with remarkably decorative safety pins attached to everything. You may also recognize them as the spiky-headed fools sitting in the back of your math class, writing nonsensical poetry.  Poetry sucks, by the way.  Only whiny retards attempting to convey some sort of clichéd message about love or other made-up bullshit such as that call themselves a poet.  I think these so-called poets should stop beating around the bush. If you have something you want to say, get to the fucking point and say it. We don’t need any more stale metaphors or superfluous references to death from some angst-ridden teenager.   Another hobby commonly associated with an immature egotistical pussy is the art of cutting.  You see, injuring yourself is marvelous because…it solves absolutely nothing.  People who make incisions in their own skin just do it for the attention.  How would I know?  Because I see said attention whores flaunting their gashes and scars all the time.  “Oh, yeah, I took a razor to my arm yesterday.  Hehe, isn’t it cute?  It’s the shape of a rose because only deep and mysterious people, like me, carve roses into their skin.”  No one cares. Next time you intentionally knife yourself, be sure to do it properly.   Cut a major vein, slash an artery or two; just do away with yourself already.  That is, if you’re not too much of a pussy.  Emo teenagers are filled with more bullshit than a box of Kraft Easy Mac.  They’re all talk.  Nine tenths of them aren’t really even depressed.  Yes, contrary to popular belief, sitting in your room all night while listening to Dashboard Confessional and complaining about how your pathetic life sucks does not make you depressed; it just makes you look idiotic and whiny.  Common things an immature egotistical pussy whines about:  “I hate my life.”  No shit.  No one is satisfied with his or her life.  Don’t bitch about how hard your life is until you actually have something of importance to bitch about.  I know a lot of people who have been through utter hell and yet they don’t wallow in their own self-pity half as much as emo fools do.  Believe me, the world won’t stop spinning because your boyfriend broke up with you or your mommy won’t let you go to that Good Charlotte concert. Get over yourself.    “No one understands me.”  What is there to understand?  Nothing goes on inside that brainwashed head of yours.  Even if you did possess some form of intelligence, chances are, no one would give a fuck anyway.  No one wants to understand you because you’re boring and, frankly, a waste of time.  If you’re going to spout off moronic bullshit such as ‘no one understands me,’ you may as well just hang your lonely, misunderstood self, you know, since you pretend to like suicide so much.    What drives emo teenagers into this pseudo fit of depression other than this being society’s latest fad?  I honestly believe it’s due to their lack of intelligence.  I’ve never seen a self-proclaimed emo child prove to be an exceptional student.  Because of this and their inability to excel at sports, emo children feel the need to fall into a stereotype because they’re too indolent to find out who they really are.   I doubt it makes a difference who they really are, though.  Immature egotistical pussies are most likely worthless.  I hope they all commit suicide.  The bastards.

      (Note:   The following article was written by Brian Krall, and has been posted with his permission.  I rewrote some of the sections and drastically edited others, but full credit goes to Brian; all of the ideas and opinions expressed are solely his.  If you would like to see the original article in full, feel free to contact me.)  “Summer”  It’s the end of the school year and we are all happy and shit.  Now we can run off, get drunk, and get killed!  Or even worse, get arrested.      Right.  One thing that I hate about the end of school and onset of summer is yearbooks.  I really hate yearbooks.  Do I really want to remember any of these fuckers?  Of course not.  They could all overdose and get a few STD’s; I wouldn’t give a damn.  I also don’t understand why people write a novel in each other’s yearbooks.  You’re going to see the dumb ass all summer, get drunk, and smoke with them, so why the life story?  I hate when people ask me to sign their yearbook.  Why do you want to remember me?  My purpose in life is to disappear into the crowd and be forgotten by everyone.  I pity the next person who asks me to sign the damn piece of shit.  I might gouge their eyes out with the pen and then beat them with the horrendous object until their intestines are visible.  Then I will eat them (the intestines, not the person) like spaghetti.  It is amazing how much people will write in a yearbook, but when it comes to English essays, they write no more than two sentences.  It’s not like anyone is going to flip back through his or her yearbook and read your prattle anyway.  They don’t give a damn, and I sure as hell don’t either.  I don’t understand humanity’s obsession with summer.    Why is it so great?   All I do during the summer is read eight thousand and a half books for school next year, while many foolish others waste their time by going swimming and doing other pointless shit such as that.  Speaking of swimming, I really hate pools.  In my opinion a swimming pool is a gigantic toilet.  There is no telling how many little fuckers shit in that thing a day.  And not to mention urinate; there is no way to detect that except the water temperature.   By the time the pool closes I doubt that anyone would call it water anymore.   And aside from the little brats letting out their bodily fluids in the water, there are the jackasses who think that they can start a water polo game in the middle of the pool for no reason.  And then the lifeguards (who are only there for the money and attention from the opposite sex; the money is probably to buy condoms) usually join in.  Then when they finally stop, they all find girls and practically have sex.  In the pool, no less. Great, now we have shit, piss, and semen floating around.  Why anyone would want to waste his or her time at the pool is beyond me.  They could do better things with their time, like get into a car accident and die, thus helping humanity as a whole.  Summer is just a time where the most irresponsible of teenagers get drunk and drive around playing fucking loud music in their pieces of shit on wheels, all “supped up” by some jackass named Funkmaster Flex.  What kind of dumb ass actually watches crap like that anyway?  Speaking of television, there is absolutely nothing decent to watch during the summer.  Fools all over my TV.   For instance, you have talking yellow sponges running around with spatulas, and half-assed purple dinosaurs (undoubtedly played by America’s favorite children’s entertainer, Michael Jackson) spouting off inane garbage about loving everyone.  Bullshit.  What are they teaching kids these days?  No wonder kids are so fucked up.  Not only are children’s shows corrupting minds, but, by far, the worst are the reality shows.  Like I really need to waste my time by watching some stupid bitch without a high school diploma try to win the husband of her dreams.  I’d rather see a show about the crumbling aftermath of said marriage.  I also don’t want to see a show about some fucker who couldn’t sing if his or her pathetic life depended on it.  The only good thing about those “talent” shows is when the English faggot makes them cry.  Fuck this crap; we need more shit on T.V. where people blow up.    Aside from television shows, commercials haven not taken a turn for the better either.  Trust me, no one cares how many similes you can use to describe how white Momma can make whites.  I certainly find the commercial where the soda talks like some gangster annoying.  But the one that is most annoying is that damn government commercial that they put on just so that the US citizens don’t look like the fattest shits on Earth.  You know the one.  The Verb “It’s What You Do.”  No shit.  I don’t need a goddamn English class, here.   Family get-togethers are just as bad.  It’s just a bunch of old hags sitting around, listening to shit music like “The Electric Slide” or “The YMCA.”  I really don’t want to endorse a song about five fags going to a health club together.  Oh yeah, and I’m surprised at how many people I know who couldn’t spell YMCA.  That’s actually the easy part, and then all the old coots come to up to you and introduce themselves as if you give a damn how the fuck they’re related to you.  I’ve never seen you before; go away.   One came up to me and said, “Oh, you are getting so big.  What are you…thirteen now?”   “No, I’m fifteen,” I mumbled.   “Oh, fourteen.  You’re so old.”  Old hag, get a hearing aid.   I have no clue who the hell any of these people are.  I just want to be left alone. Although things could be worse, what if I actually did know who they were and had to see them all the time.  That would be hell.  I also hate when your fucking family drags you along to carnivals and amusement parks.  First of all, I like your average thrill ride and roller coaster as much as the next sap, but what I don’t like is the people there.  Carnivals are the stupidest things ever.  The best ride there are the dumb ass penguins that spin in a rather small circle.  Then I just stand in a three-hour line to go on another two-minute ride and do it all over again.  Games at carnivals suck too. I don’t get my kicks from throwing beat up baseballs at milk cans in hopes to win some crappy stuffed bear that I’ll end up burning anyway.   What a waste of money.   However, amusement parks are different.  They are bigger, the people who work there are usually not fat asses wearing t-shirts two sizes too small with beer stains on them, and they are not as local, which means that there is a better chance of not seeing any of the fuckers I avoid every day at school. There are still too many people, though.  It’s like going to the mall except you can’t by any fun video games where you get to blow people’s heads off.  And usually I don’t go tot the mall with the intent of riding a roller coaster until I puke. Puking is the best part of any amusement park.  Just when I feel sick, I look for the stupidest looking janitor, walk up to him and let it go all over him.  It works best when you eat a hot dog or two, or three, or four beforehand.   Summer blows.

      Woo, it?s time for some Xanga Mail. Sense the enthusiasm. These are all genuine, quite amusing e-mails that I have received from random people. My response is below each message, not in italics.   E-mail #1. Subject: you.   i know you are most likely too cool to read things not in html, but you should definitely read fahrenheit 451, or reread it. In the beginning you are totally clarisse but instead of optimistic pessimistic. That book totally backs you up, Or foreshadows that it is going to. It seems to be stating that retards believe in the not thinking about things too hard, like i do. And in conclusion, read the book, unless you are too hip, which I don't doubt.p.s. I also decided, solely on my own, completely arbitrarily, that you secretly wish you were incrowd.     I'm too cool for everything, fuck-o. Especially that book. It?s the most unrealistic piece of shit ever written. Why would I want to waste my time and money on something that I don't give a damn about? I have better things to do with my time, like shove a knife up someone's ass.And, you're right; I want to be part of the "in" crowd. You see right through me. I've always wanted to dress in tight, slutty outfits and fuck every self-obsessed jackass on the football team. I want to wear makeup, worry about my hair, and paint my nails so they match my $80 shoes. I wish I had a girly, high-pitched voice. I want to go to wild parties, get drunk, and smoke up with my fellow jocks and preps. That's the cool thing to do, after all. And I'd be DAMNED if I actually got good grades and paid attention during class.  Ho-ho, I'm too good for an education.Don?t make idiotic observations about me.Bitch.   Email #2. No subject.      you are an over-analyzer. It's a fact. Im sure you pride yourself on that.   Indeed.   But you are just making yourself butter and confused. You read that right, butter.   The only thing I?m confused about is how having an opinion makes me butter. Maybe you?re the confused one.   If you ever succed in analyzing everything, write Bible 2 ans send me a copy   You're right; I should start a cult.  I'll sucker everyone into joining and then lead said people to suicide.  Everyone dies except for the cool people, and you're not one of them.   I doubt it will ever happen though, it's like finishing the internet, or solving pi.   Wait, you helped me figure out a goal for myself and now you crush my dreams? Fuck you, backstabbing bitch.   The Indians already got dibs on pi though, as well as mental large number multiplication and writing really little.   That is the most irrelevant piece of information I have ever read.   eh.   My thoughts exactly.   E-mail #3. Subject: fu   ew bitch, your xanga sucks. you think your better then everyone...well ur not!! all those ppl you talk about?your just jelous   First of all, my Xanga kicks all kinds of ass. Second, I don?t THINK I?m better than everyone; I AM better than everyone, especially ignorant shits like you   .mo one cares what u think so shut the hell up, bitch   You obviously care what I think since you?re wasting five minutes of your time by sending me this grammatically incorrect e-mail. At least I do productive shit online instead of e-mailing strangers. I hope you acquire a stalker.  Morons.

      I lied when I said that I was going to write about my take on the obese population for my next rant.  Maybe next week.   This week’s gripe: movie theaters.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I like going to the movies.  I like the arcades in the lobbies; I love the kick-ass surround sound in the auditoriums. And I especially enjoy the aspect of eating unhealthy food for two hours while staring blankly at an enormous screen.  I suppose it’s just the people and related idiocies that persistently piss me off.  To find out if a mere two hours of potential entertainment is worth the inevitable torture associated with it, I compiled a list of the pros and cons that you’ll mostly likely encounter from the time you leave your house until the time the ending credits roll.  I know you’re eager to find out if you’ve been wasting all of your time and money over the years.  Con #1:  The drive.  First of all, there isn’t a movie theater in Whitehall anymore, so if you’re from the area and want to see a movie, you have to drive all the way to Allentown, past the airport.  I don’t drive, but I see where this poses a problem for the driver, especially since gas prices have escalated severely over the past few weeks. What even makes this trip all the merrier is the fact that the people in Allentown cruise down the road as if gangs of illegal immigrants are gunning them down with gusto.  Or at least this is what I’m told.   Furthermore, since, like I stated above, movie theaters are scarce in this part of the state, your specific theater is always packed to full capacity, which makes your chances of finding a decent parking space slim to none.  Hell, finding any parking space takes around ten minutes, and if you’re already late because of the jackasses on the road, you have the pleasure of resorting to walking—an arduous task because of your excessive laziness.   Con #2:  Waiting in line for tickets that are usually sold out.   Finally, when you arrive at the theater you somehow manage to find a parking space within a mile away from the front doors.  You may have injured a few pedestrians during the process of parking, but you have more important things to do than call for an ambulance right now; a few ruptured skulls can wait.   You have to buy a ticket before they’re all sold out, and you’ve already come this far to turn back now.  Especially in this certain crowded theater, the line to purchase a ticket is pretty lengthy, to put it bluntly.  I might add that your odds of getting a ticket, assuming that you arrived late due to the aforementioned time-consuming experiences, are poor.  What you need (besides the presence of intelligent life) is a plan.  Luckily, you’re quite the cunning one, and you distract the gullible fools in front of you by exclaiming that you work for the government and just got official word that an Iraqi terrorist group is concocting a sinister plan to obliterate the entire state of Pennsylvania. Panic ensues while you slip to the front of the line and snag a remaining ticket.   Undecided pro or con:  The snack line.  You get out of one line just to enter another—the snack line.  Now, you usually don’t mind waiting in this line as much because you know you’ll get to stuff your face in a mere few minutes.  Usually.  But today, because you’re so lucky, you end up selecting the line with a couple of obese gluttons in front of you.  One of these gluttons orders a large popcorn with extra butter, two soft pretzels with cheese, a box of gummy worms, a bag of M&M’s, a box of chocolate-covered peanuts, a package of Twizzlers, and a diet coke.  But that’s not all; this fat fuck’s equally overweight girlfriend would also like to consume a hot dog, a large soda, and an order of nachos with extra cheese.  The ravenous bastards.   Struggling to remember the disturbingly large order, the scrawny cashier rushes over to the back counter obtain the food while trying not to screw it up like he usually does.  After a few trips back and forth between counters, the pig ahead of you carefully looks over the food placed in front of him and nods his jiggling head in approval.  Finally your turn is almost up.  Or so you think.   The cashier rings up the couple’s order when the fat bastard nervously stops flipping his pudgy fingers through his small stack of bills.  Since Porky’s total comes to well over 40 dollars, this fat-ass doesn’t have enough money to pay the once patient cashier, who now looks on at his customers with disdain.  The piggish couple just stands there blankly, unsure of what to do, when the cashier maintains a semblance of calm and politely recommends that they put something back, in order to compensate for the bill.  Fatty shoots a nasty look at the cashier, swears to himself, and stares over his food while simultaneously breaking into a sweat and stressing over what to trade in.  Seeing that the popcorn, hot dog, and nachos have already been served with extra condiments just the way they prefer, Fat-ass reluctantly decides to surrender over a few of his boxes of candy.  Finally, after paying for his meal, the pig doleful trudges away from the line with his pudgy girlfriend waddling not far behind, both tightly holder their mountain of food (sans candy) for dear life.  Luckily those idiots in front of you rendered enough time for you to ponder over what you want to order.  Because of this, you receive your food quickly.  The balance of stupid people and delicious food makes waiting in the snack line a neutral movie-going experience, that is, neither a pro nor a con.  Con #3:  Finding a seat in the theater.  With food in hand, you head over to the guy in the wheelchair who rips tickets for a living even though he’s most likely on disability and doesn’t need a job because we’re paying for his dysfunctional ass to sit around all day and eat burgers from McDonald’s while watching re-runs of Friends.  However, you always approach this ugly man with a winning fake smile just to give him the false assumption that he’s an important member of society. He smiles a toothless grin back at you, and directs you towards your desired theater as if you’re blind and can’t read the obnoxious flashing signs hanging over your head.   You realize that you hate crippled people, and walk away feeling like the jackass that you are.  Oh well.  Because of the selfish cripple’s precise directions, you find your way to the door of your specific theater, and are greeted by the balding, perverted janitor who is holding it open for everyone while he subtly gazes at the slut’s half bare ass in front of you.   You pass him as quickly as possible and, as you enter the theater, are bombarded by a sea of people laughing and giggling and playing grab-ass with one another.  You don’t need a genius to tell you that the place reeks of idiocy, but you remind yourself that you paid $7.25 to see a movie, and damn it, see a movie is what you’re going to do, no matter how painful the experience may be.     You look around and consider your options of who to sit by.  There aren’t many seats available now because of the constant delays that your inconsiderate species have caused thus far.  Gazing into the audience, you see an open seat in the very front of the theater by a large man who probably reeks of body odor. Upon realizing that you are not yet that desperate for a seat, you spot another vacant chair; this one is in the middle of the 7th row next to a weary, middle-aged mother and her two demon spawn, both of which are whining for more popcorn and incessantly asking for the time.  Deciding that you’d rather choke on your popcorn before parking your ass next to those little shits, you make one last attempt to find a somewhat decent seat.  For the first time today, you’re in luck; you see another vacant seat.  This one is located in the back row right next to two uncivilized college kids who are too busy making out and feeling each other up to realize that people are becoming appalled and rushing away from them. More room for you. You decide that sitting by these two people are your best option because they will most likely be too preoccupied with each other to say anything during the movie, and you deserve the silence after the unfortunate events you have already gone through today.   Con #4 and Pro #1: The movie.  The lights dim.  People dutifully replace murmuring with shoving handfuls of food into their gaping mouths.  Following dancing refreshments and a pitch for donations to a local charity, the movie kicks off with a sign that reads:  Please Turn off all Cell Phones and Pagers.  Ironically, just as the opening credits start to roll, a cell phone rings, and the owner of said cell phone interrupts the start of the movie by shouting at his now ex-girlfriend on the other end of the line because she was apparently cheating on him with his brother while he was away taking a vacation in Hawaii, which his boss undoubtedly paid for since Mr. I-Have-a-Cell-Phone has been kissing ass for a good ten years.  People moan in disgust, including you, while this jackass rightfully insults his former whore of the week over the phone. You realize that all you can do is wait for the usher who is idly standing in a corner to kindly escort the cell phone motherfucker outside.  He does so, and the theater is at peace once again.  Now comes what you’ve been waiting for. Depending on which movie you carefully selected to go see, it can obviously be good, bad, or somewhat decent.  Today, because, once again, you’re just oh-so lucky, the movie you spent your hard-earned cash on is as awful as the sight of a newborn child.   Sure, it’s only thirteen minutes into the thing, but just the sight of that Jennifer Aniston bitch and all of those other spoiled, overpaid fucks is enough to compel you to run out of the theater via the fire exit and hurl yourself into speeding traffic.    So what’s a bored person in a movie theater to do?  Answer: Throw shit at people. (This is pro #1.) Remember those two bratty children?  SWISH.  Gum in their hair.  Spot some ghetto fool right in front of you?   THUD.  It’s raining cheese-covered pretzel bits on his black ass.   Ha, not so tough now are you, gangster bitch?  Hey, sitting here and not watching the movie isn’t so bad after all.  In fact, it’s pretty damn amusing.  So do you think the bad outweighs the good?   I don’t know, you decide for yourself. Personally, I think the cost of seeing a movie is utterly ridiculous when you can rent that same movie for almost half the price.  Plus, you would be in the comfort and privacy of your own home; there aren’t nearly as many stupid people there.  In contrast, perhaps the joys of tormenting people and making fun of them endlessly are worth it.  Nah, you can do that at the mall for free.  Never mind, movies blow.   Don’t waste your money.

      Don’t put busy backgrounds on your site; they’re obnoxious and they make the text nearly impossible to decipher.  I'm not saying that every background is unacceptable, but if it interferes with one's reading capability, chances are that it should go. For example, I came across a Xanga the other day with a black-and-white picture of that pretty-boy bastard Orlando Bloom set as the background.  Not only did this picture hurt my eyes, but what also made them burn was the tiny black text, which the genius site owner didn’t bother to change.  Did you catch that litte bit of information?  Black on black.  I didn’t think anyone could possibly be this ignorant, but I guess that’s what I get for looking on the bright side of things.  My point:  don’t make your readers strain their eyes just so they can read your self-centered bullshit.  You should know better.
