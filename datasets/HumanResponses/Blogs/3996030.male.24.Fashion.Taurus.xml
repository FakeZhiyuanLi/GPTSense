      History of Wagga Wagga    In December 1829, the early colonists first sighted the land on which the flourishing City of Wagga Wagga now stands. The persons thus privileged consisted of Captain Charles Sturt, 39th Regiment, stationed in Sydney; Mr. George Macleay and six others. This party passed over the site of future Wagga Wagga on its expedition of discovery down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Settlement swiftly followed.   Wagga Wagga was proclaimed a town in 1849 and in the same year surveyor Thomas Townshend marked out the town. In the 1860s the population totaled approximately 700, but by 1881 it had increased to 3,975. In 1879 the railway line was extended south of the river.   The name of the City is derived from the language of the Wiradjuri tribe, which was the biggest aboriginal tribe in New South Wales, embracing the Riverina area.   "Wagga", "Wahga" or Wahgam" in aboriginal dialect means "crow". The repetition of a word was the method of expressing the plural or emphasis, thus Wagga Wagga means "crows" or "the place where crows assemble in large numbers". The Murrumbidgee River which runs through the City also derived its name from the aboriginal language and means "plenty water" or "big water".   Wagga Wagga is 518km by rail from Sydney and 432km from Melbourne on the main Southern line. It is 185.6m above sea level and situated on the Sturt Highway, which joins the Hume Highway 48km to the east. It is the junction of the Sturt Highway and the Trunk road known as the "Olympic Way", which enables travellers by road to proceed to and from Sydney via Cootamundra, Cowra, Bathurst and The Blue Mountains area, instead of travelling via the Hume Highway.   The City, incorporated as a Borough in 1870 and proclaimed a City in 1946, has an area of 488,600 hectares, and at the 30th June, 1998, and estimated population of 58,000.   On 1st January, 1981, the existing City of Wagga Wagga became amalgamated with the adjoining Shires of Kyeamba and Mitchell.     there is also that wagga wagga a history book which im sure that the library will have a copy of - i'm not sure if we are wanting to include wagga in the mural but its better to have some information than not have any at all    &nbsp;  &nbsp;- jess

      Each of the 3 skylights could feature a definitive&nbsp;aspect of each sister city.  eg. Nordlingen's definitive rooftops. It could use a combination of the perspectives of the image and the actual skylight.  -Lisa

      I (Ange)&nbsp;found this... It has some interesting, but brief&nbsp;stuff.   Kunming is a famous city with a long  history . The region of Kunming is thought to have been inhabited for about 30,000 years. Zhuangqiao established the Dian kingdom on the eastern bank of Lake Dian 2000 years ago. The town of Tuodong on the northern bank of Lake Dian was built at the early period of the Tang Dynasty (618AD-907AD). Since the Yuan Dynasty (1206AD-1368AD), Kunming has been the capital of Yunnan Province. Now 25 ethnic Groups are living in Kunming, including the Han, Yi, Miao, Bai, Zhuang, Dai, Naxi, Hani, and Lisu.      Historic relics and tourist attractions  are the Dizang Temple, the old Yunnan Army School, the golden hall of the Taihe Palace, the Green lake, the Yuantong Temple, Xishan Park, Lake Dian, the Daguan Building, the Black Dragon Pond, and the Qiongzhu Temple.   Well-known  traditional food  includes preserved rutabaga with roses, rice flour noodles, moon cakes with hams inside, hams, and pot-cooked chickens.      Local specialties  are Yunnan white medicine powder, Yunnan tobacco, and ivory sculptures.    urlLink http://www.orientaltravel.com.hk/culture/Kunming.htm

      Well, I've [somehow] been made joint Technical Director of this project. I, personally, think it's going to be somewhat difficult to come up with ideas and suggestions for&nbsp;materials we could use when no decisions have been made regarding the format of the mural. Are we going for panels? A continuous artwork? What?    I'm asking for suggestions. If you want to suggest materials or just an idea for the whole piece, comment on this post. I'll be forever in your debt. Or something.  - Bec

       As Ive told some of you guys already, I know someone who&nbsp;went to Kunming at the end of last year. He took photos while he was there, and I was thinking they&nbsp;might come in handy for our mural, seeing as there will be no copyright issues to deal with.    Just a thought...       From Ange.         &nbsp;

      These are excerpts from a speech given by Kevin Wales- Former mayor of Wagga Wagga.     "Wagga Wagga City Council currently has three Sister Cities.&nbsp; Leavenworth, USA, which was developed in 1962, Nordlingen, Germany and Kunming in China developed in 1988.&nbsp; It is very fair of me to say that the Kunming, China Sister City is by far the most progressive.&nbsp; The Leavenworth, USA relationship is really only used for visits by our Miss Wagga Wagga and Community Princess every two years, whilst the Nordlingen, Germany relationship does entertain several visits by Council and community groups, whereas our Miss Wagga Wagga and Community Princess are hosted in Nordligen every alternate year to Leavenworth."

      The initiative for the Sister City Program is attributed to the Dwight Eisenhower, who was the US President from 1953 to 1961.&nbsp; His statement is quoted as follows:       The Sister City Program is an important resource to the negotiations of governments in letting people themselves give expression to their common desire for friendship, goodwill and co-operation for a better world for all.      The initial objectives of the program focused on the development of durable networks of communications between cities of the world for the principal purpose of  reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and conflict among nations. &nbsp; In this sense, the program could be viewed as foreign relations at the local level.   To be quite blunt; the whole Sister Cities idea was mainly to try and stop people from being so suspicious of American interests and profits from "aid and trade" after and during the war. Basically; the Americans gave a hell of a lot of funds to Western Europe for the specific purpose of rebuilding; however, there was a catch that W. Europe had to give a detailed report on what it was spent on. Turns out W. Europe spent over 70% of this money on American manufactured goods. The Soviet Union was suspicious, (and well they should be)&nbsp;&nbsp;and then&nbsp;formed a separate plan for the economic recovery of  Eastern  Europe and this was associated with the policy of isolation for which Winston Churchill coined the well-known expression: “ the iron curtain”. Thus, when Eisenhower became the US President in 1953, “trade and aid” was not a popular phrase.&nbsp;   The Sister City Program, which began in 1956, was not designed as a substitute for the Marshall Plan, but it was nevertheless hoped that such a network would recover some of the loss in goodwill that was associated with the tied aid.   For more specific information on this, visit:  urlLink http://http://www.accci.com.au/sister.htm#program    The initial objectives remain as the foundation for many, if not most, Sister City agreements today.&nbsp; These agreements are formalised when two communities from different nations join together to develop a  “friendly and meaningful”  relationship.&nbsp; The central element is the exchange of people, ideas, culture, education and technology.  In recent years, “trade” has become effectively de-linked with “aid”, and most Sister City agreements contain explicit provisions for trade and economic co-operation.&nbsp;   This was posted by Allicia. Please excuse any cynicism within the text.

      This concerns the state of Yunnan, of which Kunming is the capital. I guess it's a continuing thing.......    The logo for the '99 international Horticultural Exposition features a green flower, which symbolizes all forms of life in the world, held in the likeness of a hand. This lively, and highly imaginative combination of flower and hand is evocative of the harmonious relationship between man and nature, and gives apt expression to the theme of the exposition: " Man and Nature - Matching into the 21st Century ".            The snub-nosed golden monkey, a rare species that can be found only in Yunnan, runs towards us with a bouquet of flowers in hand. This mascot, its personified image rendered in vivacious colour and captivating liveliness, is an epitome of the hospitality of the people of Yunnan who are ready to greet friends from every nook and cranny of the world.          -Lisa

      Hey dudes, i have created a couple of 3D images of the Sister City walk on a 'home design' program i have at home; it is very basic but is to scale i.e 46M x 2.6M.  The brown column you see standing in the middle of the floor at the entrance to the walk is a 1.83cm representation of a person.  You can check out my model by going to: multimedia/sistercity project/images/andrews 3d.  Note: The images used for the panels are the default images of the program and the layout of the panels is rough but you should get the idea.  My idea is to divide the wall into 4 sections and display each city as a collection of smaller panels(eg. 1M x 1M,  .5M x 1M, .5M x 1.5M) these smaller panels would surround a framed map of the city.  If we allow a .5M space down from the ceiling and up from the floor we have 1.6M of wall height to work with.  Each frame would be chromed metal with a perspex (plastic glass) sheild, the backing panels could be 'Masonite' a durable and readily available wood fibreboard.  Also apart from the digital folders i have created for you to store your info i have created 'paper' folders for all the tangable print outs, i have spent a some time sifting through the printed material to organise it and found many double-ups, i would like to suggest that you leave the printing to me and everyone just save your info to your respective multimedia folders where i can peruse whats there and only print what we need, thanks to all, everyone seems to be getting right into it and coming up with really great stuff i think this project will be a huge success and something for all of us to be proud of.  Regards, Andrew.
