      i had some weird dream the other night that me and romi were going to some church so she could tell some sermon. when we got there i had to go get my bike over a hill and clean the oil out of the driveway and when i came back she was making out with some random dude in a car. the pastor came out and kept telling me i had to get her out of the car so she could do her sermon at 6, but it was already 8. the pastor was someone that reminded me of wilford brimley.  you know, there are times when you think your dreams could be de ja vu, or mean something, or be telling you about the future, and there are other times when they're just totally bizarre and have no meaning whatsoever.

      okay, the night before last i had a dream that my inner guide was a chameleon and i was following him everywhere and he was telling me lots of things about my life that were so obvious that i was just in amazement that i didn't notice them before. then last night i had a bizarre dream that i can't remember, which totally pisses me off. every time i sleep at this house i have some freakish dreams, i think because there are lots of spirits here. i've never had as many weird dreams anywhere else than at this house.

      i had a dream the other night that nick chopped all his hair off, which is really weird coz he hasn't cut his hair since he was itty bitty. so i was like "DUDE nick! you cut all your hair off!" and he was like "so. you have zits all over your face." and i looked in the mirror and i did. like bad bad. but i didn't care, and i just kept telling nick he chopped all his hair off and why and ohmigod and why didn't he seem to care as much and all that. but all he cared about was how much i had broken out, which really pissed me off.

      the other night i had a dream that my wrists were bleeding, but they weren't cut. i kept yelling at everyone to help me because i was going to die with my wrists bleeding so much, but nobody would because they just kept saying i didn't need help if my wrists weren't actually cut. i was like "DUDE! but they're bleeding! i'm gonna die!" and everyone just walked away from me.  i know there's some meaning behind "being cut off at the wrists" and then being abandoned, but i'm not quite sure what.

      wow, i haven't written in here in a while. not because i haven't had any dreams lately, but because i forgot about this log. last night, i had a dream that i woke up, and i was calling for my cat, and it was nowhere to be found, and i went outside to look for it, and there was a note on my door saying that the apartment manager would charge me 35 dollars a day out of my bank account until i paid my $250 pet deposit, or i would never see my cat again. so now i'm really scared that my cat will get taken away. either that, or i'll have to pay a lot of money to get it back.

      me, lisa, jason? and kelli? i think, were all working at tommy's and we got hella busy, and i went in the back room and everyone was staring at me. i was like, "have any of you been waited on?" and they were all, no. so i was like, "who's first?" and they just stared at me, so i was like, "fuckit. we'll take you because you're only one person and everyone else is in groups." so i got everyone menus and started to get this one guy's order, and then his friend showed up so i got his. then i went over to another table to get their order and they couldn't decide what they wanted and were taking forever, and more people were coming in, and one guy came in and said he had a party of 20 that wanted to come in and eat, so i kept looking at the group waiting and the table i was waiting on, and i was just like, "FUCK!" really loud. everyone looked at me, and i was like, "sorry." then i took their order. then i went up to get some food and i started yelling at lisa and she freaked out on me and started going into labor from the stress. so i had kelly call an ambulance or something for her and she went to the hospital, but then my dream cut out like I was going to the hospital with her, and we rear ended monica lewinsky getting out of a jaguar, and she said she was going to sue us for all we had.. then we were walking around in the hospital and somehow we got lost, and we went to some class about monkeys or something. then i apologized for being a bitch at tommy's but also said that if there were four people on the floor and it was packed we could have easily handled it had we been cut into sections, but since we were all over the place, we couldn't remember where all of our tables were and that's where we fucked up. she said it was cool and then she went into labor more and went to go have her baby, and i went back to tommy's. otis? what's his name? the bus driver from the simpsons picked me up from tommy's in a limo, except it was like an old limo.. like a rolls royce from the 1970s. anyways i was going downtown to stay at some shitty hotel or a hostel or something, and he drove me like a block away and stopped and started to call a cab. and i was all, "can i leave some of my stuff in your limo?" and he didn't want me to so i started putting lots of stuff in a bag so it would be easier to carry. i put two tiny bouncy balls in there, some kind of small doll with long blonde pigtails, my sketchbook, and a few other things. i overheard him trying to set up some kind of drug deal with the guy that was coming to pick us up in the cab, but i wasn't paying attention. then i woke up because my cat knocked over ten boxes.

      i've had crazy dreams ever since i started dating matt. so many that i can't even remember half of them when i wake up, and they're so detailed that i don't have time to write them all down before i go to work in the morning. i need to keep up with this, because in the past two months i've had more de ja vu's than i've probably had my whole life.

      scary fucking dream about an hour ago: i'm at matt's(which is obviously not matt's now) place and it's like a dreamhouse. we're walking all throughout the house. it's one level, but it's got like three steps that go down into a living room from the bedroom on the right, steps that go back up to the left of the living room that lead into a kitchen, behind the living room there's a pool room, with a heated indoor pool, and behind that there's some kind of indoor PLACE that he keeps all his wild animals. horses, boars, all different exotic things. he's taking me on a tour and it's at night and he doesn't want to turn any of the lights on, just use a flashlight. so i keep tripping on stuff and telling him i don't know my way around the place like he does and i wish he would turn on a light but he tells me it's not safe. we start to go back to the bedroom and i see someone dressed all in black breaking in about 100 feet away from us. i grab matt and we stop in our tracks and i tell him there's a burglar and to run. we run the opposite direction, towards some back doors, and thankfully matt has a system that if any door is broken into there are a series of doors that will open up to guide your way out for a number of seconds and then lock again. he stays right outside of his place so he can sneak back in and call someone, and that's fine coz i know he'll be safe. i kept running till i got to this place with all these people waiting in line. there are some kind of tellers behind glass windows and i start yelling "help, help!" and one of the tellers tells me to wait because they're checking to see where the burglar is right now in my house. so i'm standing there waiting for him to tell me what to do, and this evil motherfucker comes up to me and says something like, "thought you could get away so easily, huh?" and it's the same guy. i start backing up and he comes at me with scissors. they're really really sharp and he starts cutting my hands. this goes on for a few minutes, each time he's getting out some sharp object and trying to cut my veins. someone catches both of us and tries to keep us at a distance while they're escorting us to a safe place where they can lock him up and keep me safe, but he keeps trying to get at me. at one point we're both supposed to go through some kind of metal detector thing and there are two right next to eachother and we go through them and he jumps over his side and starts going at me again. the guards are all trying to get him off. i woke up after that. and it freaked me the FUCK out.

      i had some freaky weird dreams this weekend. one that i can remember, so i'll go with that one. it was like i was in a video game, so i'll describe it like i'm going to create it, because eventually, someone's going to make something exactly like this. it's kind of like one of those choose your own adventure books, but you travel around this world, and you can pick which direction you're going in, north, east, south or west. i started going east, and i began the game by getting training on how to pack a travel backpack. depending on what you pack, you can run faster (if you pack light), or fight harder (if you pack lots of weapons, but this makes you run slower, because you're weighed down more, obviously). i chose to pack light, and i wandered into a small town with friendly villagers. they gave me a place to stay and i bought and sold what i needed while i explored the area. i made a nice room and one day they came in and told me they were being attacked by the not so nice neighboring village. they basically told me that this would be the last time i'd see this place, because they were attacking it so much that it wasn't going to last very long, so everyone was packing as much as they could carry and getting the hell out of there. what i had to do was pack what i could, and use my training in packing to decide if i was going to need to run fast or pack heavy, and if an enemy came too close, i had to hide myself and the closest villager somewhere that they couldn't find us until they moved on. usually it was under a bed. if they got too close, it was up to me to get discovered and then fight them.  after that i had to choose between either running into the desert where there would be harder monsters to fight or to go through the amazon river, where i might run into some pretty big snakes and alligators and other fearsome things, but wouldn't be found by any monsters or bounty hunters. i chose the river, and hurried through waist-deep waters where i had to fight a few anacondas but i had a good sized knife with me that luckily wasn't too heavy, which is why i picked to pack it to begin with, so i got out alive. after that i could choose to either travel farther east into asia or i could choose to go south to african plains. of course, it wasn't asia or african plains where i'd be headed, because this was a completely different planet in a completely different universe that i was on. but you get the point. the whole idea is really great, and i know they have stuff out there like this already, but this was way more complicated than anything i've ever seen, and way more choices as well. you could ditch all your possessions and start anew, or keep getting a heavier rucksack but owning more things. or you could choose to build a house some place and find post offices in different towns to send some of your items to your home for whatever currency they used. which meant you had all different kinds of currencies, with different exchange rates and everything. you could go one place and end up paying appx. one dollar to send an assload of stuff to your home across the world, or you could pay $50 grand to send one thing, all depending on where you were. which meant if you wanted to save money, you'd have to either carry a lot of items until you reached the cheapest destination, or sell things for cash until you got there. you also made certain aquaintances along the way, some of which were enemies, and some were friends. you could write to them to keep in touch, and sometimes they would send you things with their cards back, sometimes money, sometimes just picture postcards of what was going on wherever they were. and you could do the same thing. you could take pictures of wherever you were and send it to them or back home to cherish when you got back. the goal of the game was to travel to as many places as possible before you ended up back home. if you ended up back home, everything would reset and you would have to travel to every place you've already visited to have any recollection of it whatsoever.  if you had enemies all over the place, you wouldn't be able to visit certain places without having a bounty out on you, because everyone wanted you dead in that certain place. which means you could still go there, but you'd have to sneak around, and you wouldn't be able to talk with many people because you'd be easily recognizable to everyone. there's a black market in each town, where you can get mods on just about anything you own, if you were toting around a donkey you could give it a rocket booster pack so it could go faster. if you were carrying a gun you found from a dead body you could buy it a new silencer.  also, different parts of the world you could get different training. if you went to asia you could train to be a ninja. america would teach you politics, and so on and so on. if this were the world we know, that is. think about the endless possibilities. think about the endless expansion packs. think about the endless marketing. i could sell this idea to someone easily. don't you even think about taking it.

      this is the second or third time i've had this dream, and each time i've either woken up on my own or been woken up by a phone call or something else at the perfect time. i'm being chased by dinosaurs, but it's not just me, it's hundreds of people. like a school. but older than high schoolers, but not quite as old as me. maybe 19, 20, 21. and there's my teachers from high school trying to guide everyone away from the dinosaurs, trying to calm the chaos. it's the same chase scene every time, where we run from place to place hoping that the dinosaurs won't find us, only to be told they're heading straight for us, but then we don't run. we wait, hoping that if we're perfectly still, they'll just pass on by. but they never do. they'll sniff around at a select few, then shriek the most horrid noise i've ever heard, then munch down on a coupla kids before everyone runs and hides somewhere else.  it's always the same story, but always in a different setting. this time we were in a huge museum, or something like that, like an aquarium. we could see the dinosaurs' shadows from three rooms away every time they passed by an ocean exhibit. we got news from someone that they were heading our way, and each time this happens, it's always through a door that i just happen to be standing right next to. everyone turns and looks at the door, then they all turn and look at me, just knowing that i'll be the next victim. and then i wake up. fucking dinosaurs, i wish i knew what this meant.

      i was in some kind of sci-fi worl, in a building that was very high, and i was on the top floor. we were all getting into elevators, and someone started shooting at everyone, so i ran into an elevator and as it was closing i saw my boyfriend in another elevator desperately crying. so i ran out of that one and into his. i asked him what was wrong, he said he would die if he didn't get some kind of tea or chai or melon ball. some kind of food ball that was used for remedies. the elevator went very slow and nobody in the elevator had one. as soon as it stopped i ran out and started screaming for a ball, a tai chi ball or melon ball and this one girl had a tea pill, she said that would work just as good, so she ran over and i put it in his mouth just as he died. i woke up hoping he would wake up but very, very sad, like it would be a miracle if he did.

      i had the craziest fucking dream last night. i woke up and was walking around in my trailer, and my boyfriend said, "that's a lot of piercings." i looked down and i had my whole chest pierced. 4 rings around each of my nipples and a line of studs going straight across my chest in between my breasts. i said something like, "when did i do this?" he said, "last night, you don't remember?" apparently i was drunk last night and all i could remember was going to bed. then lindsey, a customer that comes into work all the time, came up to me and i said, "do you remember where i went last night?" and he said the last time he saw me i was walking to the tattoo shop. so i sat and thought about it for a while, and i couldn't remember for the life of me how i paid for this, when or where i did it, or how i got there. but i started looking at it and i figured it was pretty cool, and if i wanted to i could always take it out. but then i started thinking about how bad it would look with my new bikini swimsuit that i bought, and i realized if i just took out a couple of the rings i could pull it off without anyone noticing it.  it didn't hurt, it looked completely healed, and it felt fine when i messed with it. it's so weird, because i would never get anything like that done in real life, nor live in a trailer, nor get so drunk that i wouldn't remember something like that. much less wake up the next day and it would be completely healed. what is a dream trying to say when you do something so insane to your outer body and don't have a problem with it?

      hyperdictionary's definition of having tornadoes in a dream is: Seeing a tornado in your dream, suggests that you are experiencing some extreme emotional outbursts and temper tantrums. Is there a situation or relationship in your life that may be potentially destructive? Dreaming that you are in a tornado means that you are feeling overwhelmed and out of control. You will be met with a series of disappointments for the next week or so. Your plans will be filled with complications. Seeing several tornadoes in your dream, represent people around you who are prone to violent outbursts and shifting mood swings. It may also symbolize a volatile situation or relationship.   last night i dreamt that my friends and family were all about to be hit by a tornado. i saw it coming, this massive expanse of a thing. twisting and twirling and eating up the sky. first i got everyone that i could out of harm's way, and when i ran outside there was another one coming straight for me. i started looking for the nearest safest building, and it was a huge gym. like in a school. i went in and there were TONS of people on the bleachers, all staring at my dad and some woman huddled in a corner. i ran over to them and told them to stay here, and then told everyone else to take cover under the bleachers because there was a huge tornado headed our way. of course noone believed me until they heard the roar from a distance. everyone was trying to get into the gym, and there i was, standing in the middle of it all, waiting for it to happen.  and then i woke up.
