      This is my first ever journal, and so have decided to keep it very secret, and only advertising my innermost fantasies on the Liberal Party website, which very few people ever go to.  I'm going to try and update this thing occasionally, but if I'm away for a long period of time, it probably means I'm on top secret missions for my Johnnie, or Tony, whom I work for. Either that, or I'm watching Absolutely Fabulous and listening to my new Kylie CDs.  Coming up to the elections though, I'll try and post a little more.  So here is a brief list of my likes and dislikes:  Like: Liberal Party of Australia, John Howard, George W. Bush, Tony Abbott, Philip Ruddock, Peter Costello, Wedge Politics, USA, Globalisation, GATS, Free Trade Agreements, the World Trade Organisation, Britney Spears, Ru Paul  Dislike: Everyone not in the Liberal Party, um.  I hope you like reading my journal as much as like creating regressive social policy.

      Peter Costello is such a super trouper (like the ABBA song - my fave is Dancing Queen). He's announced that cool 'family package' of his. The Baby Bonus is such a cool system. It gives $5000 to any new mother. (Note: all women should be mothers, that way they'd be stuck in the home and leave men's work to men.)  It's all part of our grand plan to make sure that all the children in Australia are white, and that we have lots of children. It's a great long term plan. Peter Costello is so super duper, he should have a statue built. I'm not sure who the statue would be of, but a statue would be cool.  We're focusing on country areas, to get their populations up, and hopefully, by the time they're 15, they'll already have received $20,000 from the government. Then they can work. Of course, they'd also work during those pregnancies, but that's all good. We support the women in our society.  Peter Costello is so cool, but not as cool as my Johnnie. He's a cool bloke. Plus, he's so sexy, in a heterosexual, sort of non-sexual masculine sorta way.  Amanda Vanstone said the first intelligent thing all year when she said we should get all the ethnic children and not pay $5000 and ship them off to Nauru - cause it's part of Australia, and then have them make cheap shoes and t-shirts for us to buy. Think of how it will boost the economy! They can even urinate in cans and we can add sweetener and sell it as Coke!  Tony was really happy too, because it meant that people wouldn't use condoms and that's the Catholic way. He's so cool. I wish I had his looks. What a go-er, also in a non-homosexual way.

      It's so cool that I work for Tony Abbott. He's just decided to try and ban the over-the-counter contraceptive pill. What a stroke of genius. It will mean all those over-promiscuous skanks that live in the country and inner city will be forced to stop having sex (ha!) or have copious amonuts of children.  Children are marvellous things in that they cause all those spastics, formerly known as mothers, to buy lots of stuff, making our economy stronger. And by our economy, I mean America's. Tony sure knows how to make money. And I've been learning off him, but I don't think I've quite got it yet - I found this great wall in Darlinghurst, and some guy offered me $200 in exchange for 'services'! So I shined his shoes and asked for the money, but he got all angry and poo-pooey at me and stormed off! I don't know what went wrong.  Anyway, it's a deliriously great plan by Tony. He's my hero. Actually, he's not, that goes to my Johnnie, but Tony comes a close second.   If only we could mass-produce babies, on a daily basis, and force them onto mothers who would be forced to buy them stuff. Imagine all the money! Money that I wouldn't see of course, but it goes toward the greater good. And by greater good, I mean America.

      I was just watching Big Brother 4, cause it's all like so cool and all like so true and stuff, like how my Johnnie and Dubya spy on people, using ASIO and how I spy on people when I'm using the public toilets...  Anyway, so I was watching Big Brother, I wanted Bree to win, cause she is really super-sexy, and I wish I had that metal thing in my lips too. But that doofus Trevor won! What is up with that? I mean, for one, he was so boring, and was all like in the house 'I'm Trevor, I have big hair and no personality. Blah!' I mean, has Australia gone crazy? I think the worst part was that he wasn't white though. I mean, sure, he came here when he was all like 3 or something, but why didn't the White Australia policy get rid of him? Why are we, all like giving this guy $1 million of our dollars? What a spaz. I think Johnnie should launch a federal inquiry into this. I mean, everyone so knew that he was the token ethnic guy, like how there were those token gay people in the other series. But they never won! You know why? 'Cause Australia respects it's family values.   If Big Brother was run by my Johnnie and the Liberal Party of Australia, we would have had a house full of white, alpha, heterosexual males. 'Cause that is so like the way it should be, yeah? Of course, we'd let the women in the clean up after the boys, but they'd be evicted straight away. And if one of the women were Asian or something, we'd evict them off the island. Like in Survivor (I can't wait for that to come on again.)  That dumpy Amanda Vanstone couldn't get off the couch to thwart Trevor. What a retard. She should speak to Fergie or something and lose all her fat. But she has some cool glasses.  I think my Johnnie should be in Big Brother 5. That way he'll be even more popular than he already is.

      I wish those stupid der-brains, Labor, would shut up already and realise that there are so WMDs in Iraq. I mean, how dumb do you have to be to not realise that they had the weapons? Otherwise, I mean, really, why did we invade Iraq? It so wasn’t because of oil. I mean, we already have oil, so what’s the point?  If anyone is a Weapon of Mass Destruction, besides Amanda Vanstone, it would be that der-brain Mark Latham. His stupidity has single-handedly been the driving force behind all the der-brains around the world. Well, him and that dorkus malorkus Bob Brown. Bob Brown is a total WMD cause he’s gay. I mean, if we dropped him on Iraq, the whole place would be full of rainbow flags and stupid gay people and a few tree hugging hippies. That’s even worse than Saddam Hussein. I mean, at least he had class. He also had a beret, which is a lot cooler than that dorky Akubra hat Bob Brown wears.  Those WMDs will so be found in Iraq, the real ones I mean, and they’ll be in some hidden bunker or something, along with a whole bunch of Iraqis wearing nothing and watching Western porn films. It’s so dirty, those dirty Arabs watching our beautiful Arian women. It’s almost as dirty as this fisting movie I saw at Club X.  What a bunch of spazzos. They should all get face-lifts so they don’t look as spastic anymore. They should try and look like my Johnnie. Then they’d all be sexy beasts.

      All those silly plebs, known as society, have finally woken up and smelt the coffee and realised that Private Schools are so much cooler than Public Schools. They have cool, sexy uniforms and cool, sexy people. They also have really big playing fields which are funded by the Liberal Government, and god knows, you can't have a cool school without big playing fields. Locker Rooms are also really cool.  Public Schools have no values at all. They don't let us teach religion there and when I say religion, I mean Christanity - we don't want anyone teaching that muslim towelhead religion.   People should have a choice when it comes to their values. Like those gays - they had a choice to become gay, and will ultimately be spat on for their choice. Which is good. They should be spat on, as should women, at least if I had my way. My Johnnie agrees with me, but would never say it publicly, unfortunately. Theose Taliban Towelheads had the right idea in one respect, anyway.  We should bring back the cane, I say. I loved the cane when I was at school, and sure, it may have some BDSM involved, and while that's bad, I think it's cool. The cane sure beat some discipline into those brats. Especially female, muslim brats.  You know, while I got a UAI of 99.7 and went to Rooty Hill High School, a public school, everyone should be forced to go to Kings, or Shore, or Knox - all schools that regualarly fail to get anyone in the top 1%, but they have values, and that's what matters.

      My Johnnie is such a super cool dude. He got up and said all those 'countries' in the Pacific are in 'our patch'. It's so true though, all those smelly islanders are part of the USA. When I say USA I mean the United States of Australia, of course.  I think it's time those dumbheads handed over their sovereignity to us properly, then we can run their countries properly. We'll industrialise them, cut wages, cut funding from everything except defense and then open up their land to multitudes of property developers. That's how a real country operates. And if anyone dissents to it, we've send in the riot police and break their kneecaps. Of course, once they have their kneecaps broken, they'll have an under funded medical system to send them home and they'll die of internal bleeding within the next few days. But that's what free speech is all about really.  My Johnnie is an undeniable genius. According to Jeannete, he's also a love goddess. Not that I care...  Let's hope those dirty savages join us. So in a few years, we can lock them up in internment camps and send them off to Indonesia - which we'll take over in a few years as well.

      Mark Latham has proved yet again that he's a dirty bisexual. He's all like 'I hate gay people' one moment, which gets me hot, and then he's all like 'I'm not supporting the Free Trade Agreement because it means I look worse than John Howard.' What a spazmo. He should get a lobotomy, he'd be so much smarter and on par with my Johnnie.   What that dorkus malorkus doesn't see is that Free Trade is really really really narly. I mean, with Free Trade, I can get all sorts of things for cheaper, like my drugs which are always on offer at Parliament in Canberra, my porn which is always on offer at Parliament in Canberra and my rentals, which thanks to the recent free trade agreement in Singapore are already cheaper, young, virile and ripe for the picking. Even Peter Hollingworth says so, although he'd never admit to that publicly.  Free Trade is so cool. Who cares if those bogan farmers lose out? They don't live in the city, and only the National Party will lose out, and who cares about them 'cause they're all like stupid poo-poo heads. John Anderson is such a dildo. I mean, sure in the long run, we'll be worse off, but the short-term goals and politics of my Johnnie haven't led us astray so far, so why should they now?

      It's funny. I was just reading how that bisexual Mark Latham first heard about super sexy Tony Abbott. He was on the John at Sydney University. He must have been shitting himself!  It reminds me of how I first heard about my Johnnie. I was on the John in the Carslaw Building at Sydney University, and I read some flattering graffiti about my Johnnie. Someone obviously had discovered his girth and labelled him a 'dickhead'. It's very true.  How I'd like to be sitting on the John some more.

      I reckon that bloody Mark Latham is a bisexual. He can never make up his stupid mind.   Like last week, he was all like 'oooh, Gay Marriage is so good' and now he's all like 'well, Gay Marriage isn't cool enough for me. Meh.'   He's such a poo-brain for sending that stuck up bitch Roxon to that Marriage Forum today. What's with having a Shadow Attorney-General named Roxon, that's all like that Roxanne song, which is all like red-light prostitution and stuff. Like, real leaders should have names like John and George and Earnest.   He's just a big old copycat who wants to be as cool and popular as my Johnnie, but he'll never be half as strong, manly, brawny or sexy...  Johnnie never changes his mind - he's a real true blue bloke. Like when he said he didn't want a GST. He so did not want a GST. Er, anyway.  Not like that dirty bisexual Mark Latham who's a fence sitter, it's so like un-American.   Dubya is pretty cool too, but I don't like it how my Johnnie calls him up all the time. It's so mean.  Latham could be cool too - he should just join up with us like that Nelson dude. He sticks to his guns too, like when he said I'll never be a member of the Liberal Party. What a trooper.

      My Johnnie is on the phone to that doofus-brain George Dubya again. He thinks he's so special, but in reality, Dubya is a spazmazoid. I mean, he doesn't even have sexy eyebrows. Or cool glasses. What a reject.  Tony wants me to take out the trash. He's such a meanie. I mean, sure Amanda  Vanstone is dumpy, but she's got some good politics, not like that der-brain Latham. Although, he has got cool glasses..  This senate review into gay marriage is such a rort. I mean, it's not as if we don't know Latham poo-for-brains isn't going to agree to it anyway. What a dork.  Johnnie said the funniest thing to Dubya right now, he was all like 'Hey, I'm Bob Brown! I'm the Leader of the Greens! I have no politics! I'm stupid poo-poo-head. I want to be Prime Minister, but I'm not bald and I don't apply turtle wax to my scalp every day, so it's not going to happen. Nah Nah Nah!'  My Johhnie is so hilarious. I wish I could get closer to him to see how he... thinks.
