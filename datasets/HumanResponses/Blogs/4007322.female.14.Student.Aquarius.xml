      Ok today wasn't a bad day.&nbsp;I got up like normal and ate breakfast. I just sat around until about 2 because my dad was getting off of work and we were going to have a cook out. So at 3 the people from Louisiana came over for the cook out. All the kids swam while the adults talked and cooked. We then ate at like 5, and I was so hungry. We all talked and just had a lot of laughs, and then we swam again. I dried off with and Ashton and me rode the golfcart around the yard. I did these doughnuts around the yard, and then Ashton did one and the golfcart about flipped. Very scary but fun!! Then it was time for everyone to leave and I then asked if Ashton could stay. I didn't even need to ask everyone just said yeah whatever. So I drove Ashton to her pop's house and she got some clothes and then I drove back over to my house. And after watching Viva La Bam and listening to music here i am writing on the Blog. So that was my fun filled day!!

       Ok today was fun. I got up at like 10 and then shannon called.&nbsp;She wanted to come over so i said ok. Mom had to go to the store and seeing as i can't drive i decided to go with her and then go get shannon. Shannon came over around noon. We ate a pizza and watched Head of State. After eating and watching the movie we decided to swim. So we swam for a long time and then laid out in the sun. I think we got a little burnt. We then came in and i took my shower while she talked on the internet. We had to be at a basketball game at 6 and Shannon finally got off of the internet at like 5:15. We ended up being late. Only to be shot down by Niki because my friend from Lousiana is in town and she didn't like her style. O well. My grandma was going to pick us up but she was late. So we just sat outside. Shannon's boyfriend even left us sitting outside the gym. When grandma came we were hungry and wanted to go harass Shannon's brother at work so we went to were he works, but he had the night off. We then went to Wendy's and ended up eating in the car. Fun. We took Shannon home and now I am here writing in my blog. How much fun.
