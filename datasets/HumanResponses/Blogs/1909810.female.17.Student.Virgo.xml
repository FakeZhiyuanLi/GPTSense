      My hummus is gone.  I have a pounding headache.  My math test was incredibly wonderful, I'm so happy.(seriously)  I need to finish my book.  Chemistry sucks.  It's only monday.  I want to go to Tuscon.  I don't want to take the PSATs...or any test for that matter.  I'm tired.  I seem to complain a lot.  What should I do?

      Today is Saturday.  I went to Macy's this morning while my car's oil was being changed.  I finished a painting I had been working on for quite some time, it's not that it took me a long time to do the actual painting, but I painted most of it and then it took me forever to finally paint the rest, I'm satisfied with it :)    and my cat is sitting on top of my monitor right now, she's so cute but one of her paws is like...extremely swollen right now, I think she got stung or bit or something while playing outside, but it doesn't seem to bother her. Wow..I don't know why I like my cat so much, she's odd, and sometimes has the qualities of a dog. You know when you scratch a dog in the right spot their leg gets thumping? I started scratching under her chin and she started doing that..it made me laugh. and now her front half is hanging over the monitor and she's falling asleep.... ah...she's great.

      2 more classes until my day of school is over. I hate math, I hate coming back from lunch to walk in to a class of 39 students in a tiny classroom with windows the size of...well I don't know what size they are of but they are fricken small windows(smaller than any of my other clases)...listening to a teacher go on in monotone about math terms I have yet to learn because I have not once gotten through a day of math with out spacing out. Wow.   I'm getting out of my French class, there is no fricken way I can stay in that class. My mother is going to help me, maybe take a correspondence class with a tutor and just not have a fourth period. High school is hell.  But ahh..the weekend is almost here, and quickly it will be gone again, but I can always look forward to another.

      Silly little crushes...while they can be fun at times, can also be really dissapointing.  I took the military's test today. I think I'll join.  uhh...what?

      Wow, peace project just puts me in such a better mood! I went there today feeling all lonely and depressed and such, and after we started doing stuff I was happier :) we had to pair up for an activity thing and it's nice not having to be the one that is forced to say "I don't have a partner"...that may sound corny...but it's nice. And also small groups have formed, just because that happens in large groups of people, and it's nice to be in a group although I don't talk much. And speaking of not speaking much, I am determined to fix that somewhat, hopefully, at least a  little . I'll try (even though I say that  all  the time).  Whatever.   School makes me sad. Grades are awful things. I think I'll be giving up my 4.0 this year, except that I'm taking AP classes so that might help, but I might have to force myself to say good bye to my straight A's.  Maybe that will be a good thing for me. Maybe I can release some of this unneeded anxiety that I have and just say screw it. I need to remind myself that colleges don't just look for grades but for involvement in things, and I'm involved...somewhat. Anyways, goals for me:  (1)Get over myself and stop being shy. (2)Get rid of the anxiety that seems to be having a large affect on my moods.

      I had a lot of built up energy tonight and ended up releasing it by yelling at my mom about the things I am pissed about. Obviously one of those things was school, mainly a specific class, then about just random crap that really made no sense because I was...ranting about...stuff that made no sense...? I ranted about how I feel powerless in a lot of things, there are plenty of things in this world that need...fixing, but how does one go about trying to fix these problems? Like I said...I just feel powerless, and slightly ignorant because I know little things about big situations, if that makes sense, I don't know the whole story. Whatever, I just hope I end up doing something that will make an impact, and I realize I can't just say "oh well I hope..ladeeda" I have to actually make it happen...but yeah, maybe once I'm out of high school I'll have a better view of things. In my science fiction class we have to create a nonhuman society, and describe their way of life, describe how they look, etc... and I like it because it's kind of like creating your own utopia. Everything can be...better.  see..I bet this made very little sense, I don't know what I'm saying.

      Aren't I special for making this pretty? I did it all by myself...cuz I'm super...or umm...not really.  I didn't do it  all  by myself, I found the black and white image online(obviously I didn't create that) and colored it with my lovely paint shop pro. But it's unique now, kind of, Alice in Wonderland is nice. Sometime soon I'll make this page a little more colorful, and now that I've wasted my time...I really should get to my homework, I have a shit load of it tonight and I'm just procrastinating...

      It's quite cold right now, or maybe it's just me, but that makes it so much nicer to crawl into bed and get under the covers. After somewhat of a hellish week has passed I'm ok. It probably wasn't all that bad I just made it seem horrible with elaborating my mind in melancholy details.  Saturday was fun, well...over half of the day was enjoyable. p.e.a.c.e is fun and being around some of the people there seems to cheer me up. After spending about 4 hours with them on saturday I went out to dinner with a friend and her sister, and then rented a movie which I expected to watch with her but ended up only watching it with her sister. But what can I say? Spending an hour on the phone with a boyfriend is much more enjoyable then watching a movie with me, and then going upstairs and "accidentally" falling asleep seems to be more amusing also. And for today, I slept, and read, and did some of my homework, and read, and slept, and put a butterfly on a t-shirt, and that's about it.  And now that I've gotten through this  exhausting  day I must drag myself up the steps and go to sleep before I fall asleep while I'm typing...

      Well, I almost burnt my house down today.  I singed a wall, broke a bunch of glass, and ruined one of my favorite cds...boy do I feel goooood.  It's kind of odd..i'm usually complaining that my mom makes me feel stupid and irresponsible...i guess this just proves that I am. Yay for me.  It seems as though some people tend to be around more when they need someone to talk to...and I'm always here to listen, but when I need listening it always seems as though they've gone away, but that's ok...i'll just strike up a conversation with myself.

      I had a better day today :) I donno..I just woke up and could tell the day was going to be more tolerable.  I'm weird. The only class that I truly dislike is math, it's so boring, I listen to the first sentence or two Mr. Jury says..and then I go off thinking about something else, then I catch the answer of a problem he had been doing and have no idea how he got there. But that's ok, I'm not going to get myself worried about that right now (even though there is a quiz tomorrow...whoops).  I really like peace project, the people there seem much more...open minded i guess, more accepting.  There is only one person in the whole group of 30 or so that truly gets on my nerves, but I won't make  too  much of it.  But she sits there playing with her...cowboy hat, or her iPod  or whatever else she happens to have that's EXTREMELY distracting while others are talking about how we need to listen to each other and respect everyone, and then she gets very annoyed if she's talking and someone isn't completely paying attention..she'll repeat a word over and over until everyone is listening and then go on with her story. But that's ok, nothing big.  But other than that I'm looking forward to peace this year, I only wish I had joined sooner...*sigh*...but anyways, the people are fun and nice, i like acting, and i like the message we are trying to get out and the things we need to get people aware of.

      My mother can be bothersome at times.  She makes these comments that make me feel like this materialistic selfish bitch...yeah, and I don't feel good today, physically and mentally.   I hate how our society characterizes success as making a lot of money, I find it sad to live in a world where money seems to be the only thing that matters...gotta get through high school and college so you can make some money, and that's it.  The education doesn't matter, just as long as you have those degrees and titles..then you're worthy enough to make money and be successful. maybe I could just run away to a deserted island and live in peace. I feel useless right now, and dumb in some of my classes. ugh, i'm just in a bad mood...i hate this feeling though, i wish it would just go away...but it always seems to come back sooner or later. And there's nothing really causing it, so I try to come up with things and excuses of why i feel this way, so I can tell myself that its ok to feel like this, that I have a right to be depressed...but I don't.  peace project was enjoyable.  I think I have an anxiety disorder.  I need help.  I'm fucked up.

      I spent some of my afternoon sorting leaves with Mrs. Flaccus.  They smelt good.  And now that I have my computer back my main site will be up and running soon and then I'll decide what to do with this, though I'll probably keep it. I'm so happy

      I can't say my weekend was filled with much excitement.  It was an extremely nice day outside today but sadly I didn't do much to fill up my time, I hung up our hammock between our two trees in our backyard and read my book which was nice, and then of course I fell asleep.  Rehearsals start tomorrow, I have a feeling this will all feel like a waste of my time, but I should make the best of it and stop my complaining seeing that it's not much to complain about.  I wish I could get over my excessive shyness, it's not just with people I've recently met..it's with  everyone  and it can be quite bothersome, especially when there's something I want to say but that I can never get myself to say and then I'm stuck pondering about things alone rather than talking to a friend. Hey...that was one long sentence. uh.  When I was younger I was never shy, up through the 6th grade I think.  During that time I talked a little too much, probably to a point where people wanted to slap me across the face and tell me to shut the fuck up. And then middle school happened, it stripped me of my sanity and here I am today stuck with myself and no one to talk to. Well...there are  some  people to talk to, but of course I limit myself and my words so as not to say too much..because being shy can do that to you...

      I bought some stuff for myself today.  I think I probably spent too much money, but sometimes you just need to spend a little on yourself...that doesn't really make sense considering most of my money is spent on myself, but I think most of my money goes to movie tickets, food, and other little things like that which I usually don't think about.  I bought myself a CD, Dilate :) I've been wanting that for an extremely long time but for some reason have never bought it.  So now I have 15 of Ani's CDs. Obsessed? Me? Never.  And I bought a new bag for school, it's the best bag in the world. Seriously.  From Anima's...so it smells nice too.   I'm painting a picture, I'd say I'm almost done, but it's still missing something and I have yet to decide what that is.  I'm slightly proud of it but I'm sure soon enough I'll wake up, look at it, and decide it's ugly.   I was planning on reading in Wheeler park today...but for some reason that didn't happen...whoops.  I really need to read my book.  Tomorrow.    I'm exciting...

      "Boredom is the failure of imagination."  A musician/writer/story teller said that at my school today.  It slightly saddens me because I often find myself to be bored.  I guess that's my fault but I've promised myself that from now on if I ever find myself in a bored state I will try to do something about it rather than just complain.  I'm not saying all I did was complain in the past, but many times I often gave up with trying to figure out something to do. Anyways...  My kitten was a girl, then a boy, and now it's a girl again.  It seems to me that vets sometimes don't know what they are doing. So now it's a girl with a boy name, but that's alright, I don't mind.  I don't understand some people.  I can understand people my age not really being interested in politics and not be keeping up with everything that goes on...that's pretty much an average teenager. In my class yesterday we were talking about the terrorist attacks (seeing that it was sept. 11) and world issues like that and someone said that he hated seeing bombings and things like that going on in other countries on the news because they don't affect him, they aren't going on in our country, so why should he care, they need to take it off the news! I then asked him if he only cared about our country and if he thought that the rest of the world didn't matter, he replied with a snotty "yeah pretty much".  What a dumb ass thing to say.  It just made me mad that he has this idea that the rest of the world doesn't affect us...  Overall my day was better than yesterday, no crying :) I have these weird spazztic emotional periods... but I'm still pissed off about the play, I don't know why I just can't get over it.  I know it's a really bad thing to think but I want Brittany to mess up...and I don't mean to think like that, I don't even  like  thinking like that, I just can't help it.  She can be extremely ditzy at times and some days you just can't get her to do anything because she won't calm down...and on those days we won't get ANYTHING accomplished because she has practically the biggest role...I reeeally need to get over this.  ok...this had no organization whatsoever...  when I get my computer back I'll make this page much more attractive :)

      Hey look it's a post.  I miss my website, and I think it helps my mental state to get some of my feelings out, which I have yet to do with an  actual  person so writing to the internet and those who take time to read this(..uh) will have to do.  I may decide this will be a permanate home for my blog..seeing that some people know my web address and it might be best that they not see it, even though it's non-existant there right now. Anyways.  I go through the same every year, some years it's worse than others, I fall into this gross ugly hole of depression, and I can say it is not in the least bit fun.  Many would say I need help, I had gone quite a long time with out hurting myself...but I did today, I was crying...quite a bit...but then I just stopped, so it was a temporary release of my...whatever it was, which probably isn't the most healthy way to do that, but it worked, and I'm ok for now and I'm gonna stop...see...done.  I hate highschool...I really do. I have this deep passion towards hating it.  I was slightly looking forward to the play this fall...that sometimes makes me feel good..but that's usually because I can get the role I want, but I didn't.  After I was already feeling stupid and worthless I went to check the cast list and Brittany had gotten the part...that really upset me.  The day before she had said to me "She'll probably cast me as Ruth...", well Ruth was the character I was set on getting.  When I went to check the list Brittany was sitting on the floor and I looked and then for some reason she felt the need to keep repeating, "I told you! I told you so!! Didn't I tell you!?" I just kind of nodded and turned away and she said "Aww Sarah don't be mad." I just wanted to tell her to fuck off. But I didn't.   I'm hoping P.E.A.C.E. Project will get me feeling better.  So far I am liking some of the people involved and it's fun, I'll just have to get over my extreme shyness so I can actually say something rather than just sitting alone. Wow..I sound like a winner...I'm gonna go to bed.

      I really appreciate when people go out of their way to throw eggs at my car.  People are such asses. That's what I have to say.  And while cleaning it off I noticed a crack in my car that wasn't there before. Hmm. So I think I'll be cleaning my car tomorrow, I still have "FHS" on the back...yeah, it's been there for about 3 weeks.  I'm so lazy when it comes to cleaning my car...I usually don't care.  But now I do, because it looks extremely trashy, like...gross trashy.  Egg smells bad too *barf* at least I thought it was the egg...it sure smelt weird.    I tried some tea today...I must say I wasn't too impressed, but my mom said, "I'll have to get you some better tea sometime" Anyways, I'm tired, and I get to sleep in tomorrow.  I like that idea. Good night. ZzZzZ

      I didn't know Kalamazoo was a real place.  Then I asked my mother for reassurance and apparently I have relatives there. Odd.   Another good day, but I have to say it wasn't as "woo hoo" as yesterday. But I laughed a lot, and it feels good to laugh to the point where you can't stop.(of course you  eventually  stop, so you really can stop...but you know what I mean)  I don't have to go to any of my classes tomorrow!! Woo Hoo yay for me! Go AP chem magic show! It's really dumb, but it's fun. Hopefully we won't screw it up too much for the little children. And we won't burn them to death or anything...we have so many piromaniacs in that class.   well uh, yeah.

      Ah, good days are always lovely.  Having someone appreciate what you do is always nice, "That alone is a reason to get up in the morning!" A girl said that to me today. I made someone happy. I love that.  I've decided to be a more cheerful person, and I've got no reason not to be.  I know it may take some time but I can handle that.  I realized today no one likes to be around depressing people, and it's not a fair thing to bring everyone else down :P I sound corny and cheesy but I don't care, it's always OK to do that sometimes.  Things are only going to be as good as I make them, and I don't always want to look back on my highschool experience as a shitty black hole of self pity.  That does not mean I'm going to be increasing my school spirit, just increasing my outlook on life a bit.  I realize everyone has their bad days, and even if I do succeed at becoming a little more positive I'll have my bad days too...but I'm just sick of having that feeling  every  day.  I don't think I need medication, I can do it by myself (for the most part).  Woo..exciting...enough of that.  Anyways, I do have things to complain about, and it's always good not to keep those things bottled up :P Being attracted to a boy-crazy girl is no good, it sucks. But what can I say, I've never been in a position where a relationship would work, but I'm not going to worry too much about that right now, I have time.   I'm quite proud of a drawing I did at school today, it was originally on lined paper so I edited it a bit with my computer knowledge so it's not best of quality...but I like it, she has no face, and that thing coming out of her head is an ear :P she's holding out a peace sign if you don't get it...and if you think it's ugly...oh well..because I don't really need anyone raining on my parade right now :)  >>  urlLink click for image

      I made it back home safely. I had fun :) it was a good weekend.  Running through big cornfields and such, exciting stuff.   Unfortunately I feel like shit right now. I got back feeling OK but I feel shaky and cold and it feels as though there were a pencil shoved in my throat. Lovely.  I liked skipping school today, but now I have myself worried that I won't be able to catch up tomorrow, which is silly but what can I say?

      I'm preparing myself to drive to Tuscon alone, kind of nervous, but I think I'm a little less nervous than my mother.  Hopefully I'll be able to find my brothers appartment, it shouldn't be too bad.    My cat was just giving me the scariest look. It's sitting on top of the screen with its paws hanging off the edge and was staring straight at me with one i completely open and the other only half way. I think I've become obsessed with this little creature. She got stuck on the roof today...I had to rescue her, and yesterday she was stuck in a tree. Poor thing.  I got out my violin today and managed to tune it...I was surprised.  I am teaching myself a Yellowcard song, it's a band that has a violin in it. Yay. I like playing.  I should have never given it up, damn me and my...stupidity.  I am getting tired, and seeing that I will be driving tomorrow I should sleep. Good Night.

      AP Chem is a fucking hard class. Holy shit.  I'm always lost, I just sit in the back with Leslie and Sarah as we laugh at ourselves because it makes no sense...and it doesn't help that Mrs. Flaccus gives this look of dissapointment when we don't understand something..i don't know what it is...it's just this...look, kind of makes me feel dumb, but I've been feeling dumb most of the year so yay for me.  It's odd..one of the classes I like the most I'm getting a B in,I don't know how that happened. This week is homecoming...Hurrah! uh...no.  I was going to Biff's after the PSAT on saturday with Leslie and NAU was getting ready to start the parade...ahh...it just made me worry that college is just going to be another high school, and I don't think I could handle that.  I   really  don't want to go to school on thursday, it's going to be dumb. Extremely short classes a pep assembly(YES!!) and a parade..woo hoo. I have so much school spirit...I need to be a cheerleader.

      uhh...so I took the PSAT this morning. Wow, the math part was really really really easy, there were questions like "if x=2 and y=4 what is x+y?" well..maybe not  that  simple but pretty close. The verbal part..uh...well lets just say it would be helpful if I expanded my vocabulary. I am sleeping in tomorrow...I'm tired, and I could sleep now I guess...but then the morning would come to soon and I don't want it to be sunday.  Every sunday I have this lingering feeling that school is approaching the next day and for me...well that's never a good thought.  It's kind of sad.  Both of my best friends have lost their virginity and I still haven't had a first kiss.  Seems kind of silly and immature to be thinking of this, i feel like a dork, but what can I say my mind wanders.  Ever have to moments where you feel like you couldn't possibly be more of a dork even if you tried??  With dumb immature thoughts and you just wanna smack yourself? yeah...I feel like that sometimes...a lot of the time...most of the time.

      I found myself wanting to go to the football game against Flag High tonight...is that bad? I haven't been to a game since I think Homecoming my freshman year. But of course I didn't have anyone to go with(seeing that my friend is a cheerleader and would be cheering obviously) and no way in hell was I going alone.  I had an exciting day of school today. I still have an A in my AP chem class...barely.  I got a B on my french test, then went home by myself for lunch again, then designed some shirts in math class, that's what i do in math, math is dumb. We had no rehearsal today, holy shit what are we doing? We aren't going to be ready if people keep not coming. What can ya do though? I've  missed 1 rehearsal and that was because I had to go to phoenix for an information thing.  And I don't know what it is with people ignoring me lately.  I was talking to my friend and she asked me a question and while I was in the middle of explaining it she turned and walked away without saying ANYTHING because she saw her boyfriend...she could of at least said something like "hold on a sec" or "oh there's drew I gotta go..." but no..she just walks away while I was in the middle of a sentence. Yay.   My cat was in a tree today.

      Go see Thirteen, it's an extremely good movie. Very intense though.  I cried(but then again I always cry so it isn't much of a surprise). I saw it with peace today.  I really enjoyed it.   But I was ignored today, and I have never been so...obviously ignored as I was today. It was strange. Oh but it made me feel good don't worry.  We were trying to figure out rides from theatrikos to the mall because some people didn't have a ride, someone said they had room for like...4 and I said I had room for 3, and the person with room for 4 got 3 to go with her and then someone was asking for a ride and I said right to her face I had room and she kind of just paused..and then turned around asking for a ride from someone. Hmm...it's nice when you can't even fit in with peace members, that's alright though, my goal shouldn't be to 'fit in' with people, I guess I don't...mind being a loner.  AP chem is a fucking hard class...and Mrs. Flaccus taught us something we needed to know for a lab  after  we turned it in. It was like 'oh ok thanks a lot' so I bet I failed that, woo. That's alright though, I tried.

      I haven't been very happy lately(and if you've been reading this you've probably figured that out).  I have never been stressing out about school as much as I am right now.  I can't get myself to let go of my perfect A's, and I have been thinking about this for quite some time, trying to organize my thoughts and feelings.  I've created this idea that if I don't get accepted to those 'top' schools, if I don't get in the top percentage of my class, and if I don't achieve an excellent score on my college entrance exams then I'll amount to nothing and I won't get anywhere in life or succeed. But at the same time I don't even think I have enough motivation to work as hard as I would need to be working to keep those A's and have a complete understanding of the material.  I've become one of those people who expects to be at the top without having to do the work, and I guess I've gotten away with that for a while because I've gotten away with slacking off a lot, I think I slack off more than people realize, and like a great percentage of people in this world I am a horrible procrastinator.  I've come to realize that nothing will really matter unless I have at least some happiness inside of me, so this stressing out thing is doing me no good.  I think I need to stop my procrastinating and get things done when they need to be done. That way I can work hard, understand more of the material, and do well in school, and if I don't get excellent grades after that I'll feel good anyways because I'll know I tried hard and I'll have earned the grade I received. Or I can just keep working the way I am and just try to get rid of the anxiety that is completely unnecessary...well uh, we'll just have to see how that turns out. But I've decided I'm going to try and focus on the brighter things in my day rather than keeping a hold of the shitty things.  What I really need to do is find some enjoyment in my days, because I'm never going to like anything I'm doing if I'm not happy, and as Erica told me, you can be happy anywhere you are. I think i've just wrapped myself up in this college thing too much.  Well...off to do my homework, maybe, I'll do it in a little while, no need to do it right away :)

      I'm lonely. And not really that 'I want to be in a relationship' type lonely, more of a 'I don't have anyone I can relate to anymore' type lonely, and that's not always fun, but i'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this at times, so I think I'll survive.  I have a headache, it really hurts, I am going to take some aspirin or something...because it's making me dizzy. I would really like to just not do my homework, but that would probably be a bad choice on my part and I would get stressed, actually it would just add on to the stress that I already have.  We pissed off my french teacher today, well I didn't do a whole lot of talking so I don't think I played too much into doing that. He's very upset that we have complained to the principal about the class and we were trying to explain to him today that we haven't really grasped anything in the class yet, and that's probably because he's taught very little. We have a test on wednesday, and I haven't learned anything in the class yet. Sad really.  I tried so hard to get out of that class but I couldn't so I'll be waiting for this semester to be over, well I'm already waiting for this year(and next year) to be over, so it just adds to my impatience.   I really want to give up on Northwestern.  Jesus.  My mother's making me cry, gahh, well it's not really her fault, she's just bringing me to reality I guess. I'm not going to be able to take a whole 3(and 4) years of french..i just can't do it.  And according to my mom that will help determine I won't be getting into Northwestern. I don't want to take another year of math, i don't  have  to of course but without it I won't even be able to  apply  to NW.  Now I don't know what to do, I need advice.  I don't want to be around my family members right now either...  I just had the most awkward moment.  I was allowing my mother to read an reply to an argument on homosexuality that was on a message board...and I forgot I mentioned I was bi in my response, and she was like "oh really?", not in a bad tone, and I was just like "uhhh..." it was weird. Now she'll prance off and tell my father and her relatives, because she always feels the need to tell her sister and mother EVERYTHING that goes on between us...grr. That's a bit annoying.  And to end on a happy note,  I'm writing a story, and I'm excited.  It's for my science fiction class, but I'm gonna make it good :) because I have some good ideas for it, and yeah...so maybe..just maybe, if you are privaledged enough you'll be able to read it...because I know you're just  dieing  to...

      I found this quite funny:  urlLink 300 proofs of Gods existance(click)  There's so many of them though, so it's quite hard to read them all at once, but if you do decide to read it, make sure you read 202 and 207...those are funny :)  and no, I wouldn't really call myself an atheist...I am not Catholic/Christian, I would say I'm more undecided than anything else, but that was very funny to me. Maybe I'm just weird.  Spitalfield is good...I like their music. But that's me. I'm pretty tired, I think I'm gonna go to bed soon...

      Every other person and their mother is on anti-depressants..seriously. Oh but I'm not, and I've yet to decide if that's a good thing or not.  I like peace project...I really do, it's something that I can do apart from school and it's theraputic(sp?) in a way. I just have to learn to make friends with some of these people...and it's not that I don't like them, there's actually a couple of them I extremely admire and would LOVE to actually be friends with(there's quite a difference between 'friends' and 'peace project aquaintances'...is that how you spell it? I can't spell anything today..i don't know what it is..) but like always I'm to shy and I've drawn myself away from people for too long...I seem to ramble about this a lot, i'm just so angry with myself...   I have the most odd mood changes.

      I love tagging along with my friends and their boyfriends...I find so much joy in that. uh. I don't always mind hanging out with them of course, but sometimes it can get a little old and awkward.   Leslie and I watched The Lion King today, good times.  It was so much nicer when we were little and obsessed with that movie, we'd go outside and play with our tiny plastic animals and make houses out of leaves and pine needles, but yeah, we don't do that anymore.  That used to keep us entertained for hours.  Fun stuff.

      Ok, well it's past 11, and for me on a school night that's quite late. I am trying to do this stupid little worksheet for my english book so I can take the test/write the essay in class tomorrow and I'm having a bit of trouble so I'm just sitting here staring at the paper.  I hate thinking about what the theme(or themes...) of a book is, our english teacher has taught us that it must be in an if/then type of statement, and no where else have I seen that. And for every single essay or book that we've read so far that we've talked about the theme has been " If  you fight for what you believe in you'll gain freedom and respect"...every single one, no joke.  It gets a little old, and I'm trying to come up with a theme for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and I realize it's about rebellion against authority, and repression, and freedom and all that exciting stuff. But I can't think of a sentece to put down on this shitty little piece of paper that I am tempted to shred into tiny pieces right now, gahh! I like English, but I think I'm too dumb for it. Chemistry too, I am understanding nothing in that class. Oh and math! I am really excited about finishing up a test tomorrow because I know the material...I've complained about school enough, I should stop. But I don't think I have ever hated school this much in my life. Maybe I'm just exhausted...  I need a hug.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY ERICA!  I did have some fun this morning, I got to eat breakfast at Macy's, the freshman and sophmores had to take a test so we were on a snow day schedule, after eating breakfast with Leslie and Sarah we took the disposable camera that was in my trunk and we had a lot of fun...unexplainable. I need to get them developed...and maybe...just maybe you will all be privaledged enough to see some posted on here :)  that was the fun part of my day. And fuck do I hate my part in the play! It seriously sucks..i have this hatred towards brittany now because she got the part I wanted and I don't want to sound all conceited..because I'm not, but I know I could do it SO much better than she could and she pisses me off and she won't stop being...stupid. It's just like calm down for 5 fucking minutes so we can actually get something DONE in the short rehearsal time that we have especially now that we've lost 3 weeks of rehearsal..but whatever, I'll get over it, it just would have been nice to have that part because I could have fun with it and I'm not having much fun with anything else.   I think i'm going insane.

      I wasn't myself today.  It was odd.  I didn't really... do  anything.  I've been realizing lately that I don't ever do anything.  I feel like I'm just here.  I routinely go to school, take classes with out having any reason to why I am taking them.  I guess it's because I want to go to college.  When I get there I will probably still be in this funk of "what the hell am I doing here?" and end up drifting through college with no idea of what I want to do with myself.  I'll end up as some old lady still trying to figure out what I want to do, then realize how old I am and that I've somehow managed do go through life doing absolutely nothing.  This is all I do.  My current job in the world is to wonder what I am doing and what I'm going to be doing.  That is it.  I don't  do  anything else.  I sit at home when I'm not at school passing time by doing nothing, really, I can't even recall doing anything worth mentioning.  I go to movies but is that anything special, not really.  And then I find myself thinking like I'm thinking right now and I scare myself.  I am a crazy person.   Well, I did play Risk today, and that's enjoyable. Mwahahaha, take over the world, master and commander :)  anyways...maybe I'm just tired.

      Thanksgiving was...different.  We ate food and all that good stuff but I'm still waiting for it to actually feel like Thanksgiving, but sadly, now that I look at the clock, it is no longer Thanksgiving so I guess I'll have to wait until next year.  Ah well.

      I have 4 tests tomorrow. FOUR! God damn. A test in english, AP chem, pre calc and us history. Fun stuff I must say, I don't think I've ever been so excited to go to school before. I failed my last AP chem test...and I'm so scared for this one, I studied a lot though but it probably won't do any fucking good. Ah well. I can't wait until Tessmer is my teacher again...hopefully he can get some of the information to stay in my head. Lately it seems like everything I know just kind of...falls out.  I don't think there's any room left up there.  At least there's no school the rest of the week after tomorrow...I don't think I would be able to handle that.  Orange juice is quite tasty.

      My aunt died last night.  I found out this morning.  It's weird to see my mom cry.  I didn't know what to say to her.  Her and my dad are leaving tuesday for Illinois, I decided not to go with them.  But my brother will be up Wednesday so that's alright.  My dads parents were going to come for thanksgiving, along with some aunts, uncles and cousins from his side, and now they won't be coming and I don't know what I'm doing.  Thanksgiving will be kind of odd, considering my mom won't be cooking for us this year.  Oh well though.    I really should be working on my homework.  That would probably be best.

      Congatulations to me.  I had fun.  A lot of fun.  And I actually allowed at least  some  words to come out of my mouth.  We had a cast/crew party at James house.  We ate food.  It was good.  And watched a movie and just hung around, I found myself to be enjoying something and considering the state my mind has been in lately it was such a good feeling I am only sad it's over.  Ah well everything has to end at some point.    I have so much shit to do tomorrow though.  That makes me worried, I am sitting here worrying about tomorrow.  Holy shit. I'm just tired.  It's not that late, 1:30...but I am usually in bed sleeping soundly by now but I just got home.  I need to go wash my face and go to sleep...I am having trouble holding my head up right now...  zZzZzZzZz

      Opening night went surprisingly well. Yay for our little freshman! haha...I get to say that now. I'm such a dork. I still feel like a freshman...  Schmidt came! yay, he still doesn't have my pictures for me...I'm getting quite impatient.  Amber did a wonderful job, holy shit...she amazes me.  The lights were shit though...really bad, whatever. And Brittany is pretty much...a bitch but hey thats ok.  I'm just rambling.  I donno.  I think I did well on my math quiz today...but I thought that before and woah did it turn out to be a bad day for me.  My brother is here this weekend, but he won't be coming to the show...which makes me a little dissapointed but oh well right? I'm having fun. I am. And that's nice for me :) although I am a little sick, I only went to 5th and 6th hour today which was lovely.  I have so much homework for this weekend I dont know what to do with myself, ah well. I'm not gonna stress about it.  I don't want to feel stressed anymore.  It's really not pleasant.  I have all day sunday to do it.  So that's what I'll do sunday, homework, and tonight and tomorrow I won't worry about it at all.  But see, I have to say these things over and over to myself before I really start taking my own thoughts seriously.     Amber's not gonna go to the one act competition, I'm kind of dissapointed, but I am happy for her that she's in Godspell at theatrikos, that should be fun for her.  Hopefully she'll do the spring play or I'll never be in a show with her again and I'll just have to start crying, I hate when people leave!  people ALWAYS leave, I'm always the last...stuck behind, by myself. That's one thing that I won't be looking forward to for my senior year.  I don't want to be the oldest, I don't like it.  I like being the younger one :) I know...I'm a freak. But that's me.  Well...I'm off...

      Well I failed another test, well...more a quiz really, but shit! What's happening to me?  Being the dumb sensitive fuck face that I am I started crying after I found out my score(which was right before the bell rang at the end of 5th hour) and I headed off to 6th our with tears streaming down my face because the test just pushed me over the edge and I cried about all the dumb things going on in my head right now and my teacher sent me to the counselor. Fuck. That was dumb.  I didn't get to talk to  my  counselor because she was at a meeting, so I talked to another woman who was very...well...I'll just say it was EXTREMELY difficult to say anything to her.  So I'm sitting in her office explaining only a part of why I was crying, and what she told me I had already heard a million times from my mother before so I just knodded in agreement with everything she said and was sent back to class with a note.  I sat in my seat stairing at my desk trying as hard as I could not to cry until school got out.  Fun fucking day for me.  And now I'm sitting here staring at this dumb ass computer trying to figure out why I'm writing any of this and beginning to cry again.  I'm a little upset.  I didn't do my AP chem homework...shit.  I don't know what I'm doing anymore.   oh and yay, I got to go to the doctors office today.  I keep getting this weird sore/infection in the back of my mouth, for a while we thought it might be my molars but then we thought otherwise.  I went to the doctor today and she had no idea what it was and then my doctor called the dentist  and he said if she didn't know he wouldn't know so I'm going to a specialist on Tuesday...I might even get to have a biopsy(sp?) done. Score. I'm going to bed.  Maybe I just need some sleep.

      Wow, tech week this week. haha, that makes me laugh, no not really, we suck.  It's shit, literally.  Understandably everyone feels nervous and such before opening night, feels that we aren't ready, and sure...that's normal, but we've never been THIS unprepared before.  Not even half the cast has lines memorized.  We have no lighting yet. Our lighting might just turn out to be just on and off.  Set isn't completely done.  We open friday, newspaper guy is coming wednesday, and the teachers are invited to the thursday performance.  Super.    I'm in a really bad mood, but it's not just the play.  I feel I should keep my emotions to myself for if I rant now I may later find myself regretting having let anyone read them at all.  I find letting other people into my own emotional problems only makes things worse for myself.  Though it may feel good at first, later I feel guilty for dumping all my personal shit on them, why should anyone else have to deal with my problems? And I don't need to feel guilty, and I don't want to pity myself, I already hate myself enough for that.  It's stupid to pity myself and I have no real reason to, though my mind sometimes suggests otherwise.  I'm done.

      I'm quite dissapointed.  I started reading The Hobbit for my science fiction class(uhh...science fiction, what?) and I was...not very impressed.  So many people have made the whole Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit books seem SO INCREDIBLY wonderful, but sadly I was bored by the first chapter...I fell asleep reading it, I am only hoping it will improve for it is so hard to remember what you've read if you get bored and stop actually  reading  the story.  Maybe it's just me. I donno.  It rained all day today.  I love the rain, but this rain was rather unpleasant.  It was just too cold to be sopping wet, and I wasn't left with the wonderful smell...I wonder where it went.  I love Finding Nemo, it makes me happy. Ellen Degeneres...De...D..whatever, does an awesome job with Dory's voice, it's amazing.  Escapé!  I hate going into AP chem everyday, I dread walking into that classroom.  I still can't get over the fact that I actually  failed  a test. Oh but I got a math test back today and I got an A, i was happy, I even got a "super" sticker...yay.  First A on a test in math this year. Woo. Anyway...I must get back to reading...

      Peace project was so much fun today.  I laughed so hard, to the point of my jaw hurting, it was great.  I needed that.  And I think I'm finally over my 13 year old little girl crush on Nash.  He's hilarious and I love him, but I've realized I'm done with the whole obsessive...wierd...thing.   We open in about a week, and most of the cast isn't even off book. That's kind of scary.  Oh well though, what can ya do?  After finishing a painting from last week I started a new one that's looking pretty nifty, I'm quite proud, but it's unfinished, and I don't know when I'll be able to finish it...it was inspired by my current self dissapointment that I had ever quite playing the violin.   and uhh...  my cat chases cars.

      My aunt is going to die soon.  I know it shouldn't be coming as a surprise to me. But it is.  She's had cancer for quite some time...I can't even remember seeing her when she hasn't had it.  My family members had always said things like "she's not feeling to well..." or "she most likely won't be making it to the wedding..." or any other major event. But she did.  She always got better.  I don't think it's like that this time.  And even though there really isn't a way to prevent breast cancer(that's how it started) I must blame the doctors for her condition.  My mother said she had tried to tell her doctors she felt something odd, asked them to look at her and they said they detected nothing.  Nothing .  How could they detect nothing when she could figure it out by herself!? I think she got a couple other opinions too...they gave her the same shoulder shrug and sent her on her way to die.  Then when it became even more noticable to her she went into see a doctor again(a different one) and of course, they found cancer, in a very developed stage.  Cancer is treatable.  If they had gotten to her sooner would she be healthier?   I need to be writing her an email right now.  But the words aren't coming to me. What should I say "Oh it was wonderful to know you! I had such a great time!"  I don't know.  I haven't yet decided if I'll attend her funeral when it comes.  I don't think I will.  I don't want to remember illinois as a sad gloomy place to gather, and I don't have any real relationship with my uncle, and a funeral really isn't for the one who has died, it's for the family members. Gather, grieve, say goodbye, etc.  Do I really need to participate in that? I feel odd. I've never had anyone I really know die.  It's kind of a shock....  Ok, I don't feel I want to talk about this subject anymore.  AP chem test today. Holy fuck. That is all I have to say about that.  Math is going better. Hurray for me and listening in class! I got an A on my last quiz!! That's my first A on a quiz/test this year in that class! High 5 to me.  I saw Beyong Borders last Sunday. I love Angelina Jolie...but it was a depressing movie.  Well yeah.   Oh and Mrs. Holland has a cute frog.  "You can't fix shit if you suck!" - Amethyst.  I thought that was a nice quote.

      I really should be getting to bed soon...that way I'll be rested for a day of...nothing.  I really should  do  something with my time tomorrow.  Well it's not like I didn't do anything today, but I feel like I am a very boring person, I probably am.  No one is ever willing to tell you things like that, and that might be good...that could be a little  too  honest.  It would be quite surprising, to hear someone come out with something completely honest.  Not that people aren't honest...but everyone always holds back at the very least one thing they think about you...whether it's good  or  bad.  I'm a dork.  I am finally getting back to reading Dude, Where's My Country.  After reading a little more than a quarter of it I had to take a break in order to finish some other books that needed to be completed for assignments.  It's quite funny, he's a funny guy.  I've been meaning to see Rodger & Me, but I haven't gotten around to it...I forget, because well...I do that sometimes, a lot of the time.  It's almost Christmas...but I must say it feels nothing like it.  Maybe because of the lack of snow. I feel kind of odd...considering that christmas is all about the celebration of the birth of christ...and yet my beliefs have changed.  What is it for now? But I will have to attend mass anyways...because we do every year...and it's just something I have to do(parentals...) I hate Christmas Eve mass.  It's extremely crowded because all the people that show up are those that pretend they are good catholics when really this is probably the only time they ever  really  think of their beliefs...they would feel guilty if they didn't go because it's what Christmas is supposed to be about...religion...not gifts. So they show up to sing songs and pretend like they are listening to the priest while in their heads they are thinking of what they will be doing when they get home.  Have they forgotten anything? Are all the presents wrapped? They come Christmas Eve rather than Christmas because it would be inconvenient to go Christmas day...they have to open presents and getting ready that early isn't really an option, it would be much more enjoyable if they didn't have to go to church on christmas. Well...at least that's my thought of the majority of the people that show up Christmas eve...that's the one day of the year they attend.  I'm done.   I'm going to go sleep.

      Whenever my mother and I argue it's over the silliest things and afterwards I just can't understand how it even started.  Making my bed...that really shouldn't be that big of a deal, but while she's on one end of the argument only thinking about the bed that is upstairs with the covers thrown on the floor I am thinking about how much more of a deal she makes it seem while my brother is home, and then he of course takes her side by sliding in his little jokes or comments or whatever you want to call them, which pisses me off even more.  I don't really care if I make my bed or not...it's just a damn bed, and usually she minds...but when my brother's here she has to make it a point that if I don't make my bed I'll probably be going to hell(well...she doesn't say that exactly...but she sure makes it seem like it).  Silly arguments...

      i felt like i was talking to a brick wall tonight.  My brother came home, and I was eating dinner with my family, and I was talking quite a bit...and only recieving these blank stares in return, then after dinner in the living room with my brother and my dad I received the same looks and sure, they talked to me a little...but it always seemed like they had this "when is the bitch going to shut up" kind of tone to their voice...and maybe I was being a bitch...i donno...it didn't seem like I had an attitude...but I had a lot to say and it felt like everyone wanted to tell me to shut the fuck up...and it was like....gahh it pissed me off. Or maybe it was just that I didn't have anything interesting to say...am I really  that  boring?  Yes Sarah...yes yes you are. GAH! I should just stop talking completely...that would be fun...anyways my mom did the same thing yesterday...i was trying to talk about something i thought was funny and i was reading something to her, and i maybe had about 3 sentences left and she goes "alright that's enough" and walks away. What the fuck is that about!? They don't understand why sometimes i don't feel like talking and when i actually for once want to share something they don't give a shit! I'm just angry...lately I've been feeling a bit...ignored I guess you could say, by friends and family alike. Maybe I'm making all of this up in my head.  Could be.  I'm just pissed right now.  Another thing, i love my brother and all..but when he comes home from school...my mother! GOD! I'm sure I'm probably exaggerating some of it in my head, but she acts like he's this amazing wonderful being worthy of everything...I donno...I just feel...less important when he's around maybe? I can't describe it.  I feel like so much more of a bitch to my mother when he's here...that's what she makes me feel like...or...the way her actions when he's here make me feel like. Something like that?  Maybe it's just I like her better when he's not here. Oh well, what the fuck, I'm just going to sit here drinking my rasberry hot chocolate and reassure myself I am making this all up.  I'm convinced I'm a psycho...

      49 our of 50 on my chem test. Wow, I'm just the most smartest girl in the world.  Thumbs up for me, I raised my grade a whole 1.1%. I promise I'll stop talking about my grades all the time, I've just been so fixated on GPA's for the last couple years, I can't get myself to stop...it doesn't work.    We might change the play we are doing for the one act, or we'll just have to tell people to come to rehearsals *sigh* this happens every time and it pisses me off.  But she should have picked an actual one act in the first place...so she wouldn't have to cut out so many fucking parts, that also makes me angry.  But whatever.  There's this one that I would like to do, I don't remember what it's called, but it's a mother, father and a daughter, and it's funny, and I would like to do it but I'm not the person that gets to decide these things.  But if she did i would have a huge part, haha i'm a loser but sometimes I think she doesn't think I can pull things off, which surprises me considering me I'm [i]one[/i] of the only ones that is completely dedicated when we do playsHopefully she doesn't just call it off completely, it's fun going to phoenix for competition, although I only went once and all I did was the lights...or really just push a button, but it was fun.  I wish Amber wasn't doing Godspell at theatrikos, then she would be able to do the one act also, and that would be great fun :D buut oh well, I'll deffinately go see her perform.

      I am pretty confident about the AP chem test I took today, tomorrow my day will either be ruined in 3rd hour or it will become extremely happy.  It's kind of sad that one test decides my mood for the rest of the day.  Although I have been generally happier the last couple of days which is a plus, go me.  I'm excited for the break,  I really need a break from school.  And an aunt is coming the day after christmas, I'm EXTREMELY excited for that.  I really should be studying for an english test, and finishing my book, but eh, whatever.  We have a tree.  It's shorter than usual, but it's a nice tree.   I'm not exciting.

      The peace retreat was really fun. I am extremely tired though, 4:00 is not a bedtime I am accustomed to.  It kinda sucks because we won't have peace until after christmas break now, and I like being there, I have people to talk to :) and it's nice.  Although I haven't become extremely close to a lot of the people there, there are some who I have. And Barb wants to have coffee with me :) yay, that's always nice, she's good to talk to.  I've taken a couple of really long naps today, but I am still tired, my parents went and got a tree, it is not decorated yet.  I have to study for a chemistry test this weekend, I'm so screwed, it's just so fucking hard I should have never taken that damn class. Grrr. And I have to finish a book for a book review in english, and I have to finish the hobbit, because I never finished it and we were supposed to.  I have to do a shit load of math, god damn it! oh well, i get to go shopping for the adopt a family people tomorrow, we've already bought them 4 bikes(they are only children so it didn't cost all that much) I'm excited, these kids have nothing.  We wanted a family of 4, we got a family of 5 kids.  We expected them to want toys and clothes, and they did...but they also wanted bikes and a nintendo and such, and we can't exactly afford all of that so I am not asking for anything this year, I would be happier if they got what they wanted rather than me just get a few material items that I don't even need.

      I went hiking today, down to fossil creek, it was fun, the hike back up is a little hard, but I did it and it felt really good afterwards.  It was so much nicer than sitting in classrooms all day. Yeah, that's about it...woo...I love peace project, Amethyst and I are working on a rape recovery scene, I typed up an idea for the dialogue, i'm so proud :)  and maybe if you want to read it i'll let you, I'm so proud, I'm not a good writer...but I love what i've just written.  Today was wonderful.  But I have to return to school tomorrow eh. Ah well...because I am in a good mood.  Go hiking, and then go to peace...it will cheer you up a bit.

      I just saw the most hilarious play I have ever seen, which might not be much considering I haven't seen all that many, but it was funny.  You may have heard of it, or you may have not, but it was well done by NAU students and I must applaud them.  The Bald Soprano. If you ever get a chance, see it and hopefully whoever performs it does it justice. If you'd like to read it I've found a link:  urlLink The Bald Soprano (it should be exactly as written...i am hoping it is a link that provides the full script, i have not the time to read it now) very funny, I seriously almost peed my pants, tee hee.

      Ani is coming out with a new album! Isn't that exciting? I am only hoping I  am not dissapointed...considering some comments I have read from other Ani fans were not very flattering. If my internet connection was more reliable I could be listening to a few of the new songs...buuut it's not so I'll have to wait.  My day was filled with nothing.  But I'm going to go watch some one act plays pretty soon, i guess that's something.

      I started watching something on TV, but I couldn't make myself keep watching.  It was really painful.  To sit and watch young children sitting on the dirt floor saying "We don't have a good life.  Our life is terrible" and know that I have every material possession I could possibly want right now.  To sit there and watch children crying because they don't have a mother anymore and their father is dying for the same reason.  Listening to them talk about how they have no money in a one room hut while trying to light a fire.  It makes me feel selfish.  People shouldn't have to live like that,  children  shouldn't have to live like that.

      A second post for the day? Sure why not.  My mood has been uplifted.  School today? Not bad.  I must say I'm quite pleased with Tessmer's teaching abilities.  It is an amazing feeling to actually be doing chemistry homework and  know  what I'm doing, or know what kind of answer I am looking for.  It all just clicked in my head.  Sitting through French is not so bad, I have Joe with me, and we have quite a laugh together.  I've been going to lunch with friends lately, and I don't feel so alone.  Speaking of which I am going to lunch with Amber tomorrow which I am quite excited for.  After lunch comes a long period of math, but for entertainment my friends and I pass notes back and forth with drawings of silly interperative dancers on them and make dumb but humorous Valentines for each other(I really don't think you should ask...).  Then peace came.  It was excellent.  I had quite a fun time, it was only rehearsal...and I'm not in the upcoming performance seeing that I'm a new member, but it was funny and I actually had a conversation *gasp!* What was that? A conversation?!  Yes that's what I said, I engaged in human interaction.  I think I'd like to congratulate myself and give me a pat on the back.  I've decided to try and not be the loser that I've become and come out of the shell that I've created for myself.  Taking babysteps of course, and trying not to edit every single thought until I've decided not to speak at all.  I feel really inspired at the moment, and I am only hoping I can hold on to this feeling for more than rest of tonight.

      So I cleaned all the shit out of my car today.  Pretty exciting.  I found a wealth of writing utensils, mostly pens, but I found a lot.  My trunk still has lovely items in it though.  A roll of paper towels for emergencies, a blanket if I get cold, an ice scraper if it snows, a flashlight if I can't see, a yearbook if I get nostalgic, a prop from a play in case...i dont know, a rhetoric folder if I forget how to speak, Clue if I get bored, some CD cases for...CDs...? And I think that's it, that's all I remember but whatever.  Well...I'm off to p.e.a.c.e.

      I really don't know what to say.  I've been feeling disconnected/overly shy these past few days.  It really sucks...I start thinking of what to say...and then tell myself it's pointless or stupid and work up all these dumb thoughts and get myself all nervous.  I'm such a freak, that is really what I am.  I don't know what to do about this silly problem of mine, I really don't.  I make myself angry, but then again my mother makes me angry and school makes me angry.  Am I angered to easily?  I think I'm dramatizing...nothing.  I'm taking a problem that doesn't exist and creating it and just making myself feel confused.  Someone just needs to smack me and I wake up from my little world and feel normal.    Anyways, enough of...whatever that was.  If you haven't seen Thirteen you should go rent it.  It's EXTREMELY good, I have it now :)  It's about a girl whose life pretty much just goes to shit overnight.  Well...I really don't feel like explaining it, go pick it up and read the back of it...or something.  But it's really good,  it's up there next to my favorite, Girl Interrupted.  Nice demented movies about people who aren't doing so well upstairs.  woo...i just need to go to bed. Good night.

      A lovely package arrived on the doorstep today.  I ripped it open with much anticipation, and then I saw them.  I reached in and pulled them out of their neatly set position.  I have purple high-top Converse.  :)   Finals are OVER.  I got a B on my math final, isn't that FANTASTIC! I'm almost positive I have straight A's again.  I think I did quite well on my English final.  My stress is released, for the moment.  A three-day weekend, no studying to worry about, no homework, nothing.  My mother? Driving me crazy.  After my lovely stress release she talks of how amazed she is for a moment and then brings up Northwestern.  Now, I have really decided not to get my hopes up for this school, a lot of the admission is left up to luck with its 14,000 applicants.  But she insists that I will get in as long as I can get a 1450 on my SATs...ha...good one.  She then procedes to ask me if I was sure that I didn't want to take a fourth year of French,  4 ?? I can barely handle 3.  I'm sure this question will be brought up a few more times before signing up for classes next year.  Anyways, we are going to Illinois for spring break, we just booked our airline tickets.  We're going to visit the 4 schools I am applying to there: DePaul, Loyola, U of I, and Northwestern(if I remember to I'll take picture of the campus...it's gorgeous).  To get into Northwestern you have to go to an interview...how shitty is that! I can barely talk to people I know...I have a long time before I start applying, I really shouldn't stress myself.  See? See what I've done, I was just talking of how my stress is gone, my finals are over and my grades are good.  I of course had to drag myself back into the stressfulness that is me.    Well, I'm going to sleep in tomorrow.  Really sleep in.

      I often times find myself without much reason for the things I do, and then I hear my mother's nagging voice at the back of my head.  I can't figure out if I'm doing it for me or for her.  Maybe I'm just really stressed out right now and dissapointed at some test scores I recieved today.  I don't want to earn good grades for her, score well on the SAT's for her, go to college for her, lose weight for her, play an instrument for  her...gah.  Or maybe I'm just thinking too much right now and I really am doing it for me and it's just hard to get where I want to be.  I'm just sick of it all, I want to be done with highschool.  Gopher Sounds didn't have Ani's CD today. Grr

      I hate those dreams where you're put in wonderful situations that would be lovely to actually experience.  After waking up it's just a disappointment.  I'm sure I've written about this before,or maybe I just thought about it, but I had a nice dream last night that seemed quite realistic at the time.  The night before I had a horrible dream.  My house was my house, but it looked a little different, older, and Flagstaff was quite humid.  We had orange trees in our backyard and little ledges that hung over bedroom windows.  Well the orange trees were infested with bugs, well everything was really, slimy ones, and under each ledge over the windows were black birds with extremely scary eyes and there was shit all over the piece of wood they were perched on.  The bugs really freaked me out, they were all over my bedroom, and finally a big slimy spider thing was on my face and I couldn't get it off and I woke up to realize the plastic band of my headphones had slid down over my face and the wire was wrapped around my head, I had fallen asleep listening to music.  Speaking of music, Ani's CD is almost here.  Yay, I'm going right after school on tuesday to get it.  Eh, that reminds me.  We have finals this coming week.  Shit.  I freak out before finals, along with most everyone, but it's really not a good feeling knowing that your grade depends on ONE shitty test.  I'll be studying most of tomorrow and monday, yay, exciting.   I guess I'll be suffering through french for another semester.  When your choice is taking a 3rd english or staying in french, and the thought that the colleges you want to attend won't accept you if you only have 2.5 credits of a foreign language is pounded into your head, you're kind of just forced into it.  That was a long sentence...hmm.  I shouldn't complain though.  In peace last tuesday I became quite annoyed.  A girl began expressing a peev of hers, she didn't like that some people complained about stupid things.  Some examples: when people complain of having to mop with dirty water, well some people don't have a floor to mop.  People complaining about school, some people can't go to school.  Things like that, it all crosses our minds at at least one point in our lives.  Two seconds later this girl starts complaining about having to get a petition signed so she could get credit for her classes because of the number of absences she had, well...some people can't go to school.  I donno, she just...she never shuts up, and she gets annoyed when people don't concentrate completely on her when she's talking and when others talk she pays no attention what so ever.  I have no reason to be writing this...I guess I have nothing better to say.  It's a saturday night and I'm sitting at my house staring at  a computer screen.  How lovely.

      I just finished a painting of mine :)  I like painting, although the results are never that great, but it's fun, and I'm somewhat proud of my work.  I only have one more day before school starts again.  Isn't that depressing? why yes, yes it is.  I have to finish a paper and do some extra credit tomorrow, which is unfortunate but I did procrastinate...so I have only myself to blame.  Hopefully I'll find something exciting to fill my time with tomorrow.

      Well I'm in the musical.  I don't have a part that has a solo, which is a good thing.  Let's just say my audition was a joke and I don't think I need to go into that right now.  I'm Marcie, she's the one with black hair and glasses and calls Peppermint Patty "sir" all the time.  Pretty exciting.  I'm really nervous for the peace performance this wednesday, I'm going to fuck it up royally.

      Woo, got the cast list.  I get to perform at the Sinagua performance, which is supposed to be old members, I don't know why she cast me...but Amber's in it, and that's exciting.  She's an "honorary assistant" so she isn't acting this year but told Kristi she'd be in this performance.  I'm also performing march 9th...or 10th, I think it's the 10th, for the public performance.  I'm kinda, or extremely I should say, nervous.  I have 2 weeks before the sinagua performance.  I don't have ANYTHING memorized and we only have 2 rehearsals before we perform.  2 rehearsals in 2 weeks...that's kind of odd.  So I'm just gonna go freak myself out about how many lines I don't know and stress myself out about letting everyone else down. Woo.  I need to sleep.

      I love The Bean Trees.  I have heard about it for a while now, and know people who have read it, but no one ever cared to mention how awesome of a book it is! I love it, I am reading it for English right now, and it's good.  I've decided that if I ever have a child, her name is going to be Turtle.   We get the cast list for Peace tomorrow, I'm excited, a little nervous, but excited.   And I think Barb liked the rape recovery scene that I wrote, it just needs to be expanded a bit.  I gave her the peace website address so she can look at it and decide if it would be cool for peace to have a website.  Yeah, not too exciting, but considering it's the only lame hobby I have... I have no idea how I was planning on ending that sentence.  Hmm.    I have a test tomorrow, didn't study, but I'm not too worried about it. Well...I'm going to go watch the lovely local news now.

      Sad attempt...I know, but it means something to  me  and I guess that's what counts (oh and realize the alignment is a little weird because of the small space it's in):  I stop to think      & take a leap into what I can't remember endless nights of being provoked by silence the still breeze kissing my cheek and grasping my broken reflection only thinking of ways to hurt myself  I stop to think      & take a leap into what I can remember sitting nervously on a potentially comfortable couch waiting for questions only to give a nod for an answer and finally realizing I don't need the questions and walk out the door for the last time  I stop to think      but then take a step forward and realize I don't have to stop

      Snow day today.  That was fabulous! Being able to sleep until 10:15 was really nice.  It's much more enjoyable to eat Cream of Wheat @ 10:30 rather than 7:00.  I took a shower and got into some pajamas.  A very lazy but amuzing day.   Peace was cancelled though, i was a little sad about that, it seemed kind of silly, by 4:00 the roads weren't bad. Oh well, there's always tomorrow.  My friend and her boyfriend...sheesh.  They are a cute couple and all but sometimes it's like...just get over yourselves.  If I'm ever over at her house and her boyfriend calls she can spend HOURS on the phone with him while I sit in her comfy chair in her room doing nothing (I stormed out once...i think she felt bad...) but if I EVER call her while she's with him 5 seconds into the phone call she quickly says "I have to go" and hangs up.  She's blown me off because of him...and I'm just tired of them.  I'm not being the jealous type or anything...but it would be nice if she at least acknowledged my presence when she's with him...or if she wouldn't blow me off without telling me until  I  call  her .  Oh well, I guess she's just the kind of person who puts boyfriends before friends.  Anyways, fairywings.net has a new layout :D and I'm working on a site for peace...although I might decide it's dumb and not finish it.  I haven't made up my mind yet.  I need to go study...I procrastinate too often...

      I really like Norah Jones' song "Sunrise".   I got her new cd, and i am liking it. and this teeth whitening crap tastes like shit... It was a snow day today.  It was nice.  I cleaned my room, took a shower, went to lunch with my mother, got this cd, went to my guitar lesson and then went out to dinner with my parentals.  it was really nice outside today, the sun was shining all day (after the snow storm last night/early morning) but I was supposed to give blood today, hopefully they won't push it to next friday, because i'm leaving for chicago next friday, gonna look at schools :D  yay. um, i think that's all I have to say for now.

      Hmm. School sucks. I really hate it.  It makes me feel horrible.  Should I really be feeling such intense negative emotions over a bad grade?  Well whether or not I should be, I am.  And I'm not enjoying it.  I'm just not in a very good emotional state right now, and I haven't been for the past couple of days.  I need to stop eating these chocolate chips...

      Well, I feel better.  I just need to calm down and tell myself i'm ok.  I'm ok.  I have  horrible mood swings...they can be a bit scary :P  Anyways, I apologize for my...whines.  And the only thing I really have to complain about are the damn stringed instruments.  Seriously...if you don't know where the notes are...look back to elementary school and place stickers where your fingers go.  No one will be mad.  Just play the right note or I'll rip your face off. Or something. Yeah, most of the rest of it is looking alright.  we have no rehearsals left though. Yay.  and the AP english test is on monday.  FOUR HOURS LONG. Wow. ok, I need to sleep or something.

      Gah, I went to rehearsal frustrated expecting to become unfrustrated, because I love it.  I ended up leaving more frustrated than I was when i arrived.  Fuck.  I can't write.  I am a horrible writer.  I wrote this essay, and it's just plain gross.  Good thing it's worth a shitload of points and it's due tomorrow.  Score.  I can't dance.  I suck at the dances.  I can't sing, and I really can't act.  I don't understand AP chem or precalc, i hate french, and my shakespeare class sucks ass.  What am I doing? I really couldn't tell ya.

      The AP tests are coming up shortly.  Good thing I had my mother buy me a AP chem study book.  Did i study? Maybe...twice...at the most.  Haha.  I'm not too worried about the english one.  My analytical skills are...improving? I don't know, maybe it's just me pretending that I can read.    The musical is this week.  The band improved  slightly  since friday.  At points they make me want to shoot myself.  Is that a bad thing?  I don't want it to be over.  I'm such a loser when it comes to the end of things.  I have such a hard time letting go, well...mostly with people.  It seems in most cases they disappear or we just drift apart.  I hate that.  Amber's leaving.  What am I gonna do next year? I hate always being the one left behind?  Well, I'm probably not the only one, but my mind insists on telling me that I am, which makes me feel even more alone.  If I were graduating this year I'd be a much happier person.  I would know where I was going and wouldn't have to worry about studying for SATs and ACTs and grades would be a little less bothersome.  All I use this thing for is rants...so by now, if you happen to read this, you should realize most everything I say will be a little on the negative side.   *sigh* I feel a little alone at the moment.    My parents are leaving after my performance on friday for tuscon, yay! I love the house to myself.  I think my mother's a bit worried about me killing myself, well...maybe not that extreme, but I think she's worried i'm going to slash my arms up.  I had an awkward moment with her last weekend, after seeing the recent "incidents" on my arm she insisted on talking to me, which i guess is what you can expect from any parent.  But I get the feeling that she thinks she knows exactly what it feels like because she's a therapist, but that doesn't entitle her to really understanding what it's like.  Gah, but that's over, the awkwardness has passed, and I'm ok.  I need to go to bed.  My mind is starting to get crazy and I'm going to fall over if I don't get some sleep.

      I got a B on my progress report..... I really need to be smacked across the face and told to get over myself.  Yesterday Amber told me Mrs. Groves might not be coming back next year, she was on the RIFF list..whatever that is.  Some stupid District thing.  Anyways, that practically ruined my day.  Theatre is my highschool life, sometimes it helps get me through my day, if I didn't have it next year I don't know what I'd do, plus I'd miss Mrs. Groves herself...anyways,there was a lot of crying and such, but today she got a letter saying she can come back next year! :D woo.  It made my day.  I'm going to the book festival breakfast thing on saturday with Amber.  That should be fun.  Charlie Brown is coming along good, I'm having a lot of fun :)  I really don't have anything important to say.  I'm procrastinating, which is probably a bad idea considering I have a study session later tonight.  My cat is lying on my shoulders, she's still awesome.  I have an ap chem test tomorrow.  Shitty. Anyways, I'm going to stop with my boring...talk...and leave.

      I'm learning how to play "Buildings and Bridges" by Ani :D weee.    My mother and I had an...argument(?) last night, I don't really know what it was.  But I was crying, and it was no fun.  I can't remember the last time I told her "I Love You" other than on all the mother's days when I feel obligated to, is that a bad thing?  She's not a bad person.  I don't know how to talk to her.  I can't figure out if it's me making myself feel like I'm not good enough or if she's played a part in that.  I'm probably making all this up in my head, I'm a crazy girl.  I hate school.

      arg, I feel so bummed for Amber.  It's not fair to work so hard for so long to finally get the one thing you wanted and have money ruin it for you!  She got accepted at the theater school at Emerson in Boston, approx. 800 audition and 25 get accepted...and she was one of them.  I wish I had a money tree in my backyard *sigh*  I hate thinking about colleges now.  I'm tired of it, and I'm only a junior.  I'm sick of hating myself for ever letting a grade drop to a B (I currently have a B+ in math, and usually have a B most of the semester but somehow it always ends up an A) I'm just tired of it all... it's gotten to the point where I can't remember if I want to go to school for me...or for my mother.  I donno.  When I have finally become pretty good friends with a nice guy and start to have a crush on a boy (which hasn't happened since Nash...teehee) one of my best friends has to tell me that she really likes him...gahh. I know...stupid high school teenage girly crushes...but these relationship things? I am just so totally clueless.  It's a nice feeling knowing that both my best friends had sex this year and I haven't even had a first kiss...haha...i know, that's no reason to want a first kiss, and I don't want to get desperate or anything.  I'm a patient girl.  I can wait....

That's nice, I still have this weekend and next at the golf course, and I have to work this monday which REALLY pisses me off...but..oh..well, i'll start probably on tues at my new one.  I'm getting my hair cut and colored again today, that's nice.  I really don't have anything exciting or important to say, and nothing really to rant about other than not wanting to go to work tomorrow. I'm a boring person.

      Listening to my mother address my father about an issue between them...I don't know.  It drives me crazy.  I could never be married to her.  It sounds like a therapy session but rather than the therapist being on the outside, she's on the inside so she's upset while asking my father about reasons for things, her tone of voice though, I can't even explain it.  Maybe this is normal married couple conversation...if it is...I don't think I wanna get married. She drives me crazy.  I'm just gonna stop, and try to not listen to their conversation at the moment.  bleeehhhhhh

      It's over now.  I don't like not having rehearsal after school.  I feel...out of place.  And Amber's leaving.  That sucks.  ah well...nothing lasts forever right?  The AP english test is all over and done with.  Haha...I think I did really bad.  My last essay was so horrible, after the first 2 i just couldn't think anymore and wrote a bunch of shit that didn't make sense.  We got to choose our own topic for the persuasive essay...I chose gay marriage, and I think I did pretty well, we'll see. I need to go take a nap. I'm tired.

      Well...I guess I could say I'm a senior now.  Nothing really exciting about that, but one more year of high school to go through and I'm done (aww Erica 'member when I was just a silly freshman...) I don't like being the oldest though...I donno, just not my thing, and being in theatre without anyone from a higher class than me is weird to think about. But oh well ya know? Summer time :D no school...school sucks...but I dont have to think about it. And I'm pretty sure I got all A's and one B...go Sarah...you can handle it.

      I'm wondering if failing half of my math final (we have the other half tomorrow) was a way of something trying to tell me "Let it go"...that was actually in my horoscope the day I got my score(weird eh?). I don't think I've ever done that bad in anything. But I really should just let it go. Do you have any idea what that will do to my grade? A C probably. Ha..and I was worried about getting a B. I cried a lot on Friday...just couldn't make it stop. My mom told me that it was OK, and that it's not ruining my chance to go out of state (sure...Northwestern is probably out of the question but I've been leaning more towards Portland now anyway). Oh well, I just need to get over the fact that I thew away being the 4th in my class. That's ok. Education shouldn't be about being better than anyone else. I just don't want to stay in Arizona. I don't know. I think I'm over it, well...I'm still dissapointed, but I can't do anything about it now.

      Today was nice.&nbsp; I didn't do all that much but I wasn't a lazy ass the whole day.&nbsp; I woke up, watched Judging Amy (I love that show...I'm a dork), cleaned the permanent marker off of my brother's car (people are such ass holes...), wrote some comments about Frankenstein in my "reading journal" (it's for school), started another book called The Shipping News, haven't gotten far enough into it to determine if I will like it or not,&nbsp; went to Bookman's, Target, and the movie theatre to buy a ticket for tonight and went on a walk with my brother and my two lovely dogs (I love them to death).&nbsp; My parents left for the weekend and my brother is currently cooking dinner :D and later I am going to a movie with Amber. Yay! I haven't seen her in so long and she's leaving for college in the middle of August.&nbsp; We are going to see The Village, I wish&nbsp;I hadn't read the review for it...it was really bad, but I really don't trust those things because I often disagree, it's a matter of taste and opinion really, but sometimes the movies  are  just pure crap and no one can deny it.&nbsp; Ah well, we'll see.  School starts August 23...I had kind of expected it to be a week later or so, they moved the date up...those bastards!&nbsp; *sigh* back to highschool, at least I'll be a senior.&nbsp; One more year.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll be able to handle it.&nbsp; I'm so worried about college applications.&nbsp; Am I ever going to write the essays? I have to get Northwestern's done by november 1st for early decision, and i know that's quite a few months away, but I have to take into consideration everything else I'll be doing.&nbsp; There are a few things I'll be looking forward to though, nothing to do with academics :P&nbsp; first of all the plays, for the fall play we are doing A Piece of My Heart, i think that's what it's called, about vietnam nurses, I'm excited, and because we had auditions last year because we were planning on doing it I already have my part, she'll probably have to hold auditions again for newcoming freshman and due to the fact that some people left.&nbsp; And also P.E.A.C.E. project :D yay, I'm so excited for that (for those of you who dont know it stands for Prevention, Education, and Creative Expression, it's a theater group against domestic violence and such)&nbsp; the crappy thing is that some really cool people graduated, so they won't be in it, and I don't do too well with new people, but maybe it will be different this year since I'm all drugged up now. (social anxiety and depression...) Anyways, I'm gonna go eat some foood, I'm hungry.  (and wow...now that you've read all that your IQ has actually decreased...I know, I have nothing intelligent to say, I just ramble on about shit that doesn't matter, but that's ok, because this blog is mine and I can say whatever the hell i want...so poo.)

When I'm this tired I don't really know what I'm saying.  I miss so many people right now.&nbsp; All my lovely new friends from CSLC, my TL, my cousins, lovely Ms. Alaska,&nbsp;and more,&nbsp;i hate it.&nbsp; There's not a whole lot I can do about it though.&nbsp; My chai tea has become cold. well...lukewarm really.&nbsp; I have to start my application essays tomorrow.&nbsp; Bleck.&nbsp; I am not looking forward to this college application process.&nbsp; I dont have any clue where I want to go (other than northwestern which i wont get in to, and even if i did i couldn't pay for it).&nbsp;&nbsp;I get so frustrated over this whole thing.&nbsp; *sigh* blablablsakfdjslkjdfalakjs sorry. I'm tired, frustrated, and...I'm gonna stop writing to spare you all of my endless complaining, when i really dont have anything to complain about. Good night.

      What the premade blog layout? I know, dissapointing, but I can't access my image files right now because of technical difficulties, so this will have to do (it's actually quite nice) I was planning on changing the layout soon anyways, but that will just have to wait until I get my domain up and running again.  Anyways, D.C.? Incredible.&nbsp; Sure, there were moments I didn't enjoy,&nbsp;and a few things I would have changed, but for the most part it was wonderful.&nbsp; I met so many incredible people and made friends pretty quickly, especially considering the fact that I'm not the best with social interactions.&nbsp; My TL was awesome, I'm gonna miss her. And some of the speakers were really good, others...well...yeah. I really enjoyed the simulation, it got heated at times, and I liked it. I could go on and on about different moments being inspiring, cool people, fun sites and such, but I am really not in the mood..I just pretty much came to fix my blog. I'll write more later I promise :D

      I'm leaving this friday.  I was nervous, but I'm not anymore, at least not now that is.  The only thing I am hoping for is to not be surrounding by republicans who feel the need to pound their ideas into my head, of course I love hearing other's opinions, but there is a difference between informing and pounding.  I'm realling enjoying summer.  I'm happy. Life is good.  If only we could keep the people we love around us all the time.  But sadly, that is not the case.  My cousins left today, and I miss them so much already it hurts.  The younger one is a sophmore, the older one just graduated and will be attending college in Delaware (that is how you spell it right?).  I won't be seeing them for at least another year.  How is that fair?  We took them to Sedona, stayed overnight and hiked (unfortunately no camping during their trip). Ate dinner downtown, I went with my older cousin to get her nose pierced (her mother freaked out). And we all went to the Grand Candy, stayed in a lodge, and hiked. Well anyways, I miss them.  I need to get reading, I have 4 books left before school.  Not too bad, I just get lazy with the writing about them in a journal thing.  I'm not looking forward to reading Frankenstein, so I figured I'd read that next, get it over with.  I loved The Joy Luck Club, on my list of favorites now. Well anyways, I will start Frankenstein tomorrow and hopefully I won't despise it, we'll see.  My mom said we might be able to go on a river trip in the canyon after I return, I dont know how solid that plan is, but I'd be so excited if we could go.  Next summer, or the first summer I come back from college, I am hoping to go hiking and camping with my brother in the canyon, that would be fun.  When we were there the other day, a family was hiking up, i think there were 3 children...4 maybe, and they had hiked rim to rim, they were on their 5th day finishing their trip.  The little girl looked tired, but I think she enjoyed herself.  They were all motivated themselves to do the last mile so they could enjoy ice cream. (the little girl was very excited about that part)  What really confused me were the people hiking down in pants and about half a bottle of water...seems silly to me.  Some had flip flops on, (ha. they weren't going very far)  Anyways, we didn't go that far down, but it was fun and beautiful.  I get to sleep in my own bed tonight (haven't since the 7th) but it was worth sleeping on the couch to see my cousins.  I want to find a way to visit them, why do these things have to be so difficult, and why does new jersey have to be about a billion miles away.  Anyways, I better get ready for bed. Good night.

      I cried while reading a book today. That's a very very rare thing. If you haven't read The Things They Carried I recommend it. I haven't finished it yet, but it's really good. I'm gonna post the part that made me cry, just incase you haven't read it, because you need to. It really shows what war does to people:  Later, higher in the mountains, we came across a baby VC water buffalo. What it was doing there I don't know-no farms or paddies-but we chased it down and got a rope around it and led it along to a deserted village where we set up for the night. After supper Rat Kiley went over and stroked its nose. He opened up a can of C rations, pork and beans, but the baby buffalo wasn't interested. Rat shrugged. He stepped back and shot it through the right fron knee.  The animal did not make a sound.  It went down hard, then got up again, and Rat took careful aim and shot off an ear.  He shot it in the hindquarters and in the little hump at its back.  He shot it twice in the flanks. It wasn't to kill; it was to hurt.  He put the rifle muzzle up against the mouth and shot the mouth away.  Nobody said much.  The who platoon stood there watching, feeling all kinds of things, but there wasn't a great deal of pity for the baby water buffalo.  Curt Lemon was dead.  Rat Kiley had lost his best friend in the word.  Later in the week he would write a long personal letter to the guy's sister, who would not write back, but for now it was a question of pain.  He shot off the tail.  He shot away chunks of meat below the ribs.  All around us there was the smell of smoke and filth and deep greenery, and the evening was humid and very hot.  Rat went to automatic.  He shot randomly, almost casually, quick little spurts in the belly and butt.  Then he reloaded, squatted down, and shot it in the left front knee.  Againt the animal fell hard and tried to get up, but this time it couldn't quite make it.  It wobbled and went down sideways.  Rat shot it in the nose.  He bent forward and whispered something, as if talking to a pet, then he shot it in the throat.  All the while the baby buffalo was silent, or almost silent, just a light bubbling sound where the nose had been.  It lay very still.  Nothing moved except the eyes, which were enormous, the pupils shiny black and dumb. Rat Kiley was crying.  He tried to say something, but then cradled his rifle and went off by himself. The rest of us stood in a ragged circle around the baby buffalo.  For a time no one spoke.  We had witnessed something essential, something brand-new and profound, a piece of the world so startling there was not yet a name for it. Somebody kicked the baby buffalo. It was still alive, though just barely, just in the eyes. "Amazing," Dave Jensen said. "My whole life, I never seen anything like it." "Never?" "Not hardly. Not once." Kiowa and Mitchell Sanders picked up the baby buffalo.  They hauled it across the open square, hoisted it up, and dumped it in the village well. Afterward, we sat waiting for Rat to get himself together. "Amazing," Dave Jensen kept saying. "A new wrinkle. I never seen it before." Mitchell Sanders took out his yo-yo.  "Well, that's Nam," he said. "Garden of Evil. Over here, man, every sin's real fresh and original."   well...comments would be nice...

      I haven't yet gotten into the mindset of being a senior.  Sure I've filled out a little bit of an application, but not much.  I still feel like a dorky freshman or sophmore. And I know it's going to be a much bigger deal being a college freshman, but I've just been thinking about how this is my last year, and it's a huge relief in some ways, but it also makes me a little sad.  I've been friends with people for a really long time now, and thinking about how this is the last year that I'll be with them is kind of sad. But there are a lot of things that I won't miss.  Such as...well...everything I guess...other than a few select friends.  But I am looking forward to the silly senior things like the senior slide show, the graduation ceremony itself, sending out graduation invitations, senior pictures, I know it's silly and doesn't really matter, but I've had to just watch it for the past 3 years and now it's finally my turn :)   Ok I'm going to stop being stupid and shut up.    I need to read, still have 2 books for ap english and some writing to do about them, that's not too bad, but I'm a procrastinator and only have until the 23rd. But I've finished The Joy Luck Club, Frankenstein, and The Shipping News. I must say The Joy Luck Club and The Shipping News were incredible, I really really really enjoyed them, and as for Frankenstein, well there's some really cool ideas in the book and all, but it was just...boring I guess. I think it was the lack of connection with the characters, that's my favorite part of reading, I get so connected to characters that I am sad when a book ends because I don't get to read about the rest of the person's life. With Frankenstein I couldn't connect at all, the narrator was just annoying as hell and wouldn't stop complaining about how miserable he was and what a huge mistake he made...I didn't feel bad when his wife was murdered, he was stupid enough to not see it coming and it was just...bleh. But I think I'm going to like The Things They Carried, I've only gotten 3 or 4 chapters into it, and it's looking up so far :D anyways...I should go read now

Wasn't too difficult but it took me a little bit of time to figure it out. Anyways. Ani. What is there to say? There are not enough words in the english language to describe how incredibly wonderful she is. The show last night...wow. She played some really awesome new songs that I can't wait to buy on her next CD...(wonder when that will be coming out..?) She also played a handful of my favorite songs. Some of them include: Your Next Bold Move Anticipate Everest Shameless As Is If He Tries Anything Dilate (awesome :D) Swandive Phase Rain Check and two poems: Platform and Grand Canyon  Pretty awesome choices no? I bought her "vote dammit" t-shirt ( urlLink clickety ), the first in her series of bootleg CDs :D it's really awesome, an Andrew Bird CD (he was the opening act, I thought he was pretty awesome), some magnets for my lovely Erica (one says "Babe Magnets" :D) and Leslie bought a shirt (well I bought it but she's paying me back...she didn't have cash at the time) She got the "Folking you up" one. Yay, and I was also given a free CD, with a bunch of the RBR artists on it. So yeah, it was fun. Awesome. I had a GREAT time, and I wish she would play here more often...
