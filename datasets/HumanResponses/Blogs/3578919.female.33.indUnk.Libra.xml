      Ok, so I have read ALOT of other peoples blogs and as of yet I think 3 people (friends of course) have read mine.  I am going to start looking into places I can post my link so that I can get complete strangers to read my ramblings!!  Why would I want complete strangers to read any of my daily nonsense....Good question. I think because I want to feel connected to the rest of the world.  I want to feel as if my life has relevance. I want to feel like I am NOT in the background.  Its so easy to feel like you are fading away, becoming more invisible everyday.  I want to have something that is mine that I can either share with the planet or no one at all.  I would LOVE to have feedback about my blog, how great to start a dialogue with other bloggers or just passers by!!!  So if you happen to come across this site, please, stop read, leave a comment.  Even if you just want to tell me all about how you feel about being in the background (most of us real people feel like we are in the background)that's great.  I'm not trying to be a superstar....I am just trying to feel like I am really here.

      It's rained most of the day today so everything feels a little gray.  Trying to figure out what to write everyday is hard and it's only day two.  I want to be all those things that any writer wants to be, witty, funny, clever, engaging.  But somehow I forget all of the  witty, funny, clever, engaging things before I ever get to the keyboard.  So I guess I am just stuck with "what happened today" a.k.a. "What I did on my summer vacation"...I am sure anyone who has ever been to grade school can remember that paper.  So here goes...I woke up late, several times actually.  The alarm is set for 6:20 I am lucky to make it out of bed by 7 most mornings.  Today I was not lucky, I woke up/got out of bed at 7:40am....Got ready in a flash and drove behind every slow driver in town.  I went to work....Ok, I won't bore you with any of the details lets just say I survived the day to take the one hour drive home and pick up Mary.  We chatted about her day, she walked around a lot and played with the dog.  Oh and her papa and caca (I will explain that one later) bought her a new baby bed and they put that together, that would be the highlight of her day.  Made it home....The trip took a little over an hour and here we are at home.  Had some left overs for dinner and invited the neighbor over to play.  So, this is what I did today.  Maybe more later tonight....The night is young and so is my child, that means a 9pm bedtime and more time for me to sit at the computer.  Until then...Enjoy primetime TV.

      Well, hopefully this will be my first blog.  I've tried this once already and it didn't post sooooo lets see if this will work!!  I'm Ellen I am 33 and I live in the Midwest with my 3 year daughter Mary.  I want to be many things, but what I am is Mary's mom.  Now I know it would be easy to read this and think I am a very negative person.  I am not.  I am actually a very cheery, upbeat person that loves to laugh at just about everything (MOST of the time).   I am however, very, very realistic.  I know that to be a good mom there are going to be things I have to give up.  Like a job with a non-profit agency that is starting a program in India and they need an Admin...Hey!  I'm an Admin!  And I want to help and I LOVE the cause AND...oh wait.  I can't exactly take Mary to India now can I.  Really, lets think about this....you go from being worried to bad schools to a nearly 3rd world country where you are not sure if YOU can drink the water much less your toddler.  Oh Yeah one other thing.  I am a single mother but my daughter has a wonderful father that loves her, so I can't exactly pick up and move ANYWHERE.  Ok, no India or even Indiana for that matter I am here.  Until she is grown (however old that is).  So, my goal is to find things that fit in with my schedule with Mary that are right here where I live!  And I have started.  I am the president of our Neighborhood watch group.  I represent a couple of hundred people, never mind the fact that only 30 or so of them show up, I still represent then all.  And we are getting things done too so that helps.  It's really hard work, people don't always want to change things even for the better.  You really have to work at it.  Ok, well this is enough for now, maybe later tonight I will write more.
