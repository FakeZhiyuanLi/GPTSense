       I question myself on a daily basis. I never feel sure about much. I can recall only a few times in my life that I  knew  that what I was doing was right. To go through life feeling so uneasy about myself is like constantly being short of breath.  I knew it was right to keep Chiara. I know now that it is right for this baby growing inside me to be with another couple. The part that confuses me is why did it feel right to keep one child and now it feels right to let someone else be parents to this child? Breathe.  Some days I actually feel up and my outlook is less dreary. Then I lay in bed at night and it all creeps back...my questions, my fears, how I got here in the first place. My limbs become tense, and ache. My breath, again, escapes me. On god nights I fall asleep and do not dream. On good nights I believe that in the end it will all be worth the anxiety and the pain. On good nights I can catch my breath.  Breathe...Chiara...Breathe...

       Have you ever thought about all of the other possibilities out there?  Is life so full of distractions for so many people that we don't even see the opportunities we have before us?  Or do we see them and just ignore that they may actually be good ideas?  It seems like we limit ourselves before we even give ourselves a chance.  I see all the stuff life has put on me, all the things that are/were other people's faults and kept me from being or doing what I need or want.  I've just started to realize that some of those reasons are true but that I have kept myself down more than anything or anyone.  This makes me really uncomfortable and somewhat alarmed.  I've been fighting the world for so long and its unfairness that I've lost sight of myself.  How I act or react fucks me up more than I'd like to admit sometimes.  There is a lot of sweetness too.  I have a lot of great memories of life and that hasn't been tainted.  I guess it wasn't luck that made those good things happen.  I think good stuff comes out of bad situations that were handled well or when a risk was taken...when I let myself be vulnerable or just let down my guard in some way.  Life is so frustrating...I want to be financially independent but if I want to succeed in the long run I gotta suck it up that I got a shitty car, no money no social life and live with mom and dad.  Having Chiara is no doubt amazing, but I am torn between being a mom, a student, being "single", and needing to work.  I have already been given two absolutely amazing little girls...  They are my reminders that when I accept my responsibilities and take a risk once in a while, life's rewards are definitely worth all the other shit.

       I'm such a dipshit sometimes. Last night I went out with my sister and her boyfriend. We all had fun, but I had one too many drinks. I wasn't blasted out of my gourd, but I wasn't in any shape to drive. Anyway, we get back to the house and I proceed to call my...I guess you can call him friend or a friend with benefits. Whatever. Well I call him and we get into this big discussion about our relationship and how the distance is keeping us from being more than friends, blah, blah, blah. Well he says something that sets me off. Don't ask me what cuz I don't remember, but what I do recall, albeit somewhat fuzzy, I basically made an ass out of myself. Now, Mike doesn't realize how drunk I was. The conversation, from what I recollect and from what I have been able to glean from subsequent conversations, was not a disaster. More came out than either one of us was ready to deal with or wanted to deal with for that matter. But shit was laid out there and I hate that I don't really know what exactly was said. That pisses me off. I hate when I do that, but I don't seem to stop. I don't drink nearly as much as I did in my college days and I have been better about having diarrhea of the mouth when I have too many Jack and Cokes. I just want to have a better handle on my emotions and how and when to express them. I make things more complicated in every relationship I have ever been in with stupid stuff like this. I don't need alcohol to get myself on the dance floor so why am I completely honest only when I'm inebriated? Sober, I say what I think myself or the other person wants to hear. In the end I'm only being dishonest with myself and I screw up good healthy relationships. I know all of this in my head but I can't seem to convey it all the time. The really weird part is that when I don't tell half-truths or play a game of semantics things are better and the stress is not there to keep up that facade. So an intelligent person would see this and say "Gee, I should do this all the time". But noooooo, I have to be an idiot and fuck shit up. I want to cure this disease soon. I don't want my little girl to have to grow up guessing if what Mommy said is really true and if she should trust me. God, how do you expect any adolescent to listen to you and obey you if they know you are a crock of shit?! Chiara came along at a good time. She has accelerated my personal growth process in these last 3 years. Damn, if it wasn't for her, I'd be a more of a mess than I am now. I've heard that children can be the best teachers. Think about it for a second. An infant can teach you more about the joy or pure, unadulterated love than any other relationship can. They have just come from God himself. They are the closest we will ever get to experiencing the love God has for us in this world. Maybe that's why I melt when I hold a newborn. Maybe that's why my world slows and the dust settles leaving what is important clearly visible.

       Everyone has basic needs and we all know what they are right? Well one would hope so, but unfortunately, either many have missed that class or they are so selfish and wrapped up in their own world that they can't respect that  some one else may  have needs too. For example. My almost 3 year old daughter can't seem to fathom that Mommy needs to have cave time. So I can do whatever it is that I want that can't be done (without losing my sanity) while entertaining her wants and needs. How dare she be so oblivious to others! I try to create boundaries for her and myself, but noooo...she tramples all over them to grab onto my leg or rip up bills or throw random objects. Why can't she just say "Mommy, can you pay some attention to me?" so I can respond by saying "Sure, kiddo, give me 10 min. to finish the bills and we'll have fun." Why is that so hard? Why can't this be done?  WHY?!?!?!  I'll tell you why ..... Because she is not yet 3 ! I have to remember that her physical capabilities are developed way more beyond then her reasoning skills. When you have a child who at 2.5 already knows how to set the table better than many adults and figures out that if you pull out the dresser drawers in a staggered pattern they make steps up the the things you thought were out of reach. She amazes me on a daily basis and drives me up a wall on an hourly basis. What's the age of reason again? 7? Please, God, help me get through these next 4 years  without  losing my mind or doing something I regret to my little cherub. In the mean time, while she is napping, I am going to shower! Without worrying if she's climbed up the shelves in the closet to help mommy clean the sofa cushions with the soft scrub with bleach. Yipee!

       Right now I feel cranky and depressed. Cranky because I've been inattentive to my 3 yr. old, procrastinating, and I haven't done my usual exercise routing since Wednesday. I have a lot on my plate so I am feeling overwhelmed but I'm not helping myself out or anything by being a blob. Right now I should be writing my 3 essays for my admissions interview to CCMT and writing my resume. I have been "working" on them for 2.5 weeks. Its not that they are that hard its just I have this phobia about writing anything structural. Like if I follow the format for a proper essay I have to live within those confines. It makes me feel uneasy and panicky. What if I can't say what I need to in the right way? Or what are the right words? How do these 300 words convey who I am or encompass everything I have learned? Maybe I feel like this because I have yet to discover or define who I am. I am still searching. (I hope there are many others out there still asking questions and trying to look at things in many ways.) Its frustrating being 25 and still not know who I am. I know pretty much what I am. I am just wondering how some people can sit down and compose an essay in 30 min. and hit print and be fine with it. To me, that's an amazing gift. Is it because they have incredible inner piece? They are content with who they are in the present? Do they just not give a shit? Am I being incredibly over analytical? I'm gonna go with number 4. So I am a bit wacked out about this. Well I am off to go to mass. Yes I said mass, as in church, as in God, praying and the like. But, that is a topic for another entry...

       Thats just it.  Reality is.  It can be a relief or a slap in the face.  It can support your ideas and feelings or make it painfully obvious that you are wrong.  Its all what you realize.  Real eyes.  Real lies.  I have, unfortunately, lied to myself too often about some things that I have or have not done.  Some of the borders between "what is" and "what I wish it was" are getting too fuzzy.  This is my attempt to lay it all out there and look at it on black and white...carve the line that separates what I am from what I think others and myself should view me as.  I hope I am ready.  Breathe....
