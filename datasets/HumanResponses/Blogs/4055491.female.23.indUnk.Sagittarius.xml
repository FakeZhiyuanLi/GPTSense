      Hi, it me again!!. Knock!, knock..?! Did I get yr attention? Today I had a topic for u to ponder..(Older ppl to reminisce the gd old days?) n discuss.. Wat changes had made in life.yrs!! I meant. It maybe the place that u used to love (now dun cos someone decided to change, thinking it is a great idea), or situations u been b4, relationship (bgr, yr buddies?...enemies??.. yr childish acts??!!!) I had agreed alot of changes were made, ehh…me old already liao..start to rem the olden times..hehahhah lived in teban for all my life, hey..Used to study tat Pandan Pri. (Heard nw facing shortage of student intake?) Deserve it rite...nowadays parents kaisu, wan a gd sch..Who wan a near sch... Not like olden days...cos parents hardly care whether the kids can make to univer..Jt for the sake of convenient..(The sch jt had to work hard in improving student grades than revanotin the image of the sch ;P) tat time there is even a lady who help to carry the signboard for crossing the road to one of the entrance of the sch..Later it tranform..decide to use cheap labour telling students to stand at traffic post, pressing the button plus the teacher standing hovering there... I remember goin to PAP kindergarten...teachers are so fierce..Scolding..scold scold..slap yr hands with ruler (even pri sch do tat) pass by the "quiet" ghost NPP..."no business"..So rural..Wonder how they pass time..slp?...anywhere saw them once in "action"; rescue a dumb cat (who one day decide to climb up a high tree, later get “jelly-legs" in jumping down)..Hehhahh Lantern festive, I remember usually the older kids will burn lantern/ play candles, fireworks n crackers (used to play till some stupid kids want to hurt themselves then kena ban!! together with chewing gums) n the swings in playground...the old slide with the wax all around after a day of celebrating of "burning" lantern festival. Speaking of tis, nowadays still got ppl go to the lone Chinese garden to c the so-called beautiful lantern (they decide to go for fees during festival if not usually free to go) Swimming pool at my place “Teban”??...Sigh...lousy facilities at first got canteen later dun have n become down n out..ppl go for fancy rides lah..last time I used 2 to go to do some errands down by afew blocks, blk32..now changes so much although it seem to have “mre, better” facilities but nvr like wat it used to be lively…mre like a ghost town. no crowds anymore…not every new thing must be gd…last time we used to enjoy the gd food there, then came the renovation…things changed even the hawkers gone..replace by some new hawkers who seem to be in their first tender yrs..even some shops still stay but nvr did the crowds went back liao Children reali got wild n futile imagination …Hahha I did rem c n hear abt the story of the rope in sch(buries near the entrance of the sch), daring students will go n try to pull (like tug n war) but no use, it refuse to budge, ..Rumors the someone hang at tat tree (cos at tat time ppl believe the trees with heavy shades may had spirits hang around..Sigh..Who believe?)Even toilets at the 3rd storey are complained of ghost hunting…dun know if it is true cos ttat time we used to have class-by-class doin the maintenance of sch grounds.. ..I rem the old times when pri 5 students got to have camping in sch grounds..We get to slp in the lousy classrooms n stage..awfully freeze at dawn cos our tents get wet. We get excited to spend the nite, talking to wee hrs..Then grumble when we had to jog the reservoir at early morn for morn exercise (6am?) kena teachers say we deserve it (hey the teachers get to slp in air-con lib leh) ;P we get to drink a watered down Milo by our teachers (like water plus the Milo smell onli not even the taste!!) n curry (one had to stir n stir to c if there is any ingredients..guess..Not much budget leh)...even got hse practice...P.E lesson..either the gers get to change in the classrooms or toilet) Sch times are fun..Those days..we play than now kids study alot like swallow the whole dic.(sg smartest kid)..recess seems to be more worth in sch day to us than lessons. we play throughout the time instead of stuffing ourselves. (kids nw favor fastfood..then come the "fatty" tuff club..last time where got these.."funny weird "programs)..ttat time if u r selected, ppl give u all kind of looks leh with nicks "piggy" boi/ ger..make them embassed (no one wan to go leh, in end, skip class n the club is unsuccessful:alittle "members” who didnt turn up) . of cos now...the numbers enlarged leh..by so much..from the most loving ahlmas(who I seen) serving their “precious” grandchild drumsticks everyday without failing to the kids nw hogging the fast food restaurants (with alittle mre money, a so-called self-conscience of hygenic..all of sudden sg becomes a “heaty” place tat ppl need aircon to surive..??"since when hawkers serve the poisonous food, as if fast food dun..?as if the hawkers ppl dun care abt image??..rem when times any rumor of virus get in food, the fast food restaurants r the first to ensure ppl, n slash the price..b4 u can light a match..of cos..hawkers cant to do..(in first place they sell cheaper meh..if slash like fast food...they survive wat?)!!..idiotic!!  of cos there is times when hawkers decide to do it when economics is down ($1 chicken rice etc..NW even got economic beehoon; breakfast) (Playing marbles, zero-point, hopscotch..five stones are the games we play during lunchtime) even " eraser" games (flipping of erasers)hehah...ppl buy the whole box(cost abt 10cents each) c who get the most eraser in the end..bookshop is our fav place.."alot of new n cool things" no…ehh…NW..ppl play computer games..Internet(name it. the kids will show u all..point to u, or even show off which equipments they have nowadays” to fight against the boredom of lives n endless tuition plus sch work”) playstation PS…NT just ttat..must be PS2..or u will be poorly said to be not in fashion..or Xbox.!!. capcom games are kidish they say..poor graphics..c the final fantasy u will know…if u dun know any of them. they will categorize u as history. Receiver?…old-fashioned…Hey, man ..they will say y not get an mp3 player (like creative newest “child” tat can stores a few thousands of songs like museum)..nowadays...kids tend to be stuck at hm more playing pc games than ever going out to have a nice gd game n have a sweet sweat. internet is popluar..so do the dangers it posed…porno graphics are so easily accessed so do ppl get interested in hacking…cool..having fun..(to c a MNC breakdowns / get interrupts in their daily routine), making our parents in turn become more protective fierce eagles hovering over n around n around us. commit suicide not a big deal anymore..seem to be an easy way when ppl overcome with stress. I noticed there are newspapers reporting teenagers get stuck with huge heavy phone bills, coned by ads…getting to know mre frnds n popluar..usually are guys leh..hehhaha..not tat I say they(guys)r stupid. but u seldom c gers clocking this amount by this kind of ads…one of my guy frnd told me that there is two different lines for the different sexes. like if u r a ger, u get to call by tis nums. U will eventually speak to the guys..around..this applies to bois…mm…but some dun charge gers cos it a business tactics jt like pubs having ladies’ nite to attract guys to come. it is the same..all I had to say is cool ideas…wonder how my guy frnd spend, but luckily he not hooked to get himself in debts..;)tat all I had said, folks..how abt u? say yr views leh..J sorri if u get sleepily abt such a lengthy one piece of topics..:P
