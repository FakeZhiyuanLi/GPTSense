      Moving on from a stagnant place in life is a exceptional mark of maturity.  And moving on with grace and confidence is sexy as all hell, for life is nothing but a series of brilliant and disorderly dealings that confuse and disturb even those with the best sense of self.  To transcend from monotony is to realize self-worth.  Sticking it out does not correlate to one's resolve to succeed.  OK, maybe in a high school wrestling match, but not in life -  especially not in love  - when there's a world of incredible choice that exists.  And it does exist.  Getting outside the boundaries of the world you've defined, by choice or by force, is an  amazing kick in the ass. It's transformative, it builds confidence, and it provides a call to action.  And at some point in time, laughter will emerge through the tears, and you'll know that your personal revolution has begun.

      The first time I engaged in the delicacy of this terribly misunderstood product of the sea was at my best friend's wedding in the Hampton's (for the full effect, "Hampton's" is to be read in a Thurston Howell III voice).  The term "When in Rome..." had never beeen so applicable, so I indulged.  Now, I'm not going to compare it to discovering how sex feels for the first time, that's far too cliche and, frankly, a gross assimilation since we're talking oysters.  However, for me, it was an epicurean epiphany, so much so, the waitstaff recognized the need to set-up a shell bucket solely for me to discard the shells of my gluttonous rampage.  To this day, the bride remains mildly bent out of shape that I had consumed 5% of their total wedding budget.    What is wild is how perfect the reference to the connoisseur's delight provides such an accurate depiction of the state of my romantic affairs.  I know, I know, we're talking oysters, but bare with me.  See, I don't fall in lust or love easily, but when I do, I fall hard.  Good news is, I've become so accustomed to unrequited love that I've learned how to bounce off the surface of the shell.  Call me a victim of bad timing, introspection, or temporary low self-esteem.  All three provide an equal explanation for my day-late-dollar-short timing to the "buffet table", yet none of them provide much reassurance that the famine will be ending anytime soon.  Fan-fuckin-tastic.  Oh, I've faced the issue head on, trust me. There have been times when I battled for the oyster, plead my case with the oyster, and even passed over some quality oysters in the hopes of something better that never came my way.  In the end, every worthwhile oyster has passed me by and I've got a collection of shells that would embarass even the best beachcomber.  It's just me, my shells, and the sauce while I hold out hope for a pearl.
