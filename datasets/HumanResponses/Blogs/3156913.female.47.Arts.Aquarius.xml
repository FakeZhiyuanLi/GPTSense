      The house is full of loud noise, people doing several things at once and here I sit with a set of earphones and my portable cd player. The music is "Celtic Devotion" by Oliver Schroer. It is good to hear so much noise in this house again. All three of my children under one roof for the moment. I smile. I am  blessed beyond words. Soon enough the house will be quiet again. One son will drive off tomorrow back to his home in Quincy, Calif. The kid brother and my youngest will take themselves off to do what needs doing so their work week will start off right or be relaxing with a video game. The hubby will be snoozing in his chair and I will be puttering around doing household chores, seeing to email or hopefully writing. My daughter will be cleaning house after her two whirlwinds aka children. For the moment, this moment, I bask in the noise that is beyond the office where this computer sits. I did a good job. I brought up three wonderful children, gave them a sense of belonging and of right and wrong. I gave my kid brother the support and love he so much needed when the bottom of his world fell out one night 16 years ago and I had to come home and tell a 16 year old boy his mother was not coming home ever again. All our lives changed that night, certainly not for the better, but we're all stronger and those of us who aren't... I hope that by now they have found themselves.   The night is clear and warm, the stars are bright, the music is soft in my ears and I could dance under the heavens..perhaps I will before I turn to my slumber and my dreams...   On this eve of Beltane I wish you all Hope, Renewal and Promise...  May music dance through your soul... May Laughter and Love be the shining star the guides you Through this sometimes weary world.... Blessed Be...  And My Honored Knight... Come dance with me...

      The Day has slipped through my fingers like water. I got an early enough start on work. My mother-in-law called to see how we were. We talked for ages. I then called another couple we are rather fond of to check on them. They just got home from a visit to England. Oh yes, let me not forget to mention the usual various calls from my daughter who seems to think she must call me every single time the status of their apartment hunting changes. By the time I glanced at the clock in the livingroom I figured I had a few moments to myself before my hair appointment. I sauntered into the office and sat down at my desk, glanced at the monitor, swore, dashed out, scooped up my purse as I went and beat it down the dirt road to hopefully make it to the hair dresser's. I did and for once she wasn't running behind schedule.   Let me pause here a minute and backtrack. I have come to the conclusion, one, I not only live in a zoo, but two, I live in the twilight zone. There is not one clock in this house that runs on the exact same time, right down to the cellphones, all 3 of them. You can go from room to room, from vcr to vcr and you won't find the same time anywhere. By the way, I have one in the masterbath that's stuck on 12:30. I think a new battery is in order. I'll put it on the " Honey Do " list. There is a reason for each of these clocks being at the time they are on... I won't list them, trust me, let me spare your conscious mind. Besides, I don't want you to get sucked into this twilight zone... it's almost like a weasel getting sucked into a jet engine. Would you believe I have been after the hubby to change the clock in the office. By the time he got around to it, Daylight Savings Time had rolled around again. I don't wear a watch, despise them. I will consent to wear one if I have to be on a time schedule with appointments pending.   At the moment, I find myself with a few moments to jot down this blog while getting into Yahoo Groups to authorize a message or two for posting to Camelot's email list. I may even drop a line or two in myself. Then it's off to that movie I've missed out on so far. Nope, we didn't go last night. I was just too tired and my stomach was killing me, nerves is my guess. Tums are a wonder drug. So, third time is the charm, right GQS? ~grin~ The movie is Mel Gibson's latest, " Passion of the Christ ". My hubby is Catholic so he is curious, as I am. I am not Catholic however, I am Wiccan. My spiritual take has always been, 'all roads lead to the Divine'. I am more curious from a writer's viewpoint to see what has everyone talking so. I am also curious as to the graphic content I am hearing so much about. Late dinner afterward.   I get my grandbabies tomorrow, so my day is accounted for. My granddaughter is 7 and my grandson is 3. When we went to Vegas, I bought my grandson a broad sword and shield. I also bought a set for the granddaughter out of self defense. We'll see how it turns out tomorrow. The toys, needless to say, are going home with them.  On Saturday I am off to the Renaissance & Celtic Faire for the day. The weather is suppose to be grand as well. Another full day of knights and ladies, jousts, plays and good food. I am looking forward to it. Maybe I'll find that elusive Muse!!  Intertwined in all this is work and more work. My cup runneth over and is flooding the floor. I just hope I don't slip in it.... Oh! And my granddaughter and South Park is another blog for another day... ~eye roll~

      It's been one of those days. Today should have been a Monday. Everybody's calling, wanting a piece of me. There's work on my desk that's a small molehill. My contractors are demanding, my vendors are whining and I want off the friggin' merry-go-round, thankyouverymuch.  Yesterday my husband and my youngest son got into it and I shouldn't be surprised, they were due. it's like clock work, about every six months. In turn, my hubby decided to snap at me as well. Surprisingly, I didn't blow my own headbolt. I don't mind the arguments, I just don't care for the sarcasm. I don't need it. Call it a shut down for my own survival. I let him rant and cuss and stomp off. He took himself off to the back forty to mow the long grass, might as well be constructive in his temper tantrum, hm? The youngest got into his car and went driving. He's not stupid, I'm not worried. He just needed to get out and away before he did or said something disrespectful. Needless to say the young man came home, the hubby came into the house, they made it good. I got after the youngest, nicely...isn't he lucky? The hubby apologised for getting angry and messing up our dinner and movie date for the evening with a promise we'll do it tonight. Right now, I don't care. I'm numb. I haven't a creative bone in my body. I'm plugged into my cd player and listening to Martina McBride's Greatest Hits. I need something.... I just don't know what.   On another front, I just read GQS', my twin-soul-sister, latest blog entry. She made me smile. I'm glad it worked out. She found validation and it will all work out for the best. I could have told her that...wait.. ~grin~ I think I did.   All in all, my life is good. Sometimes, I feel like something is missing.. I could list what I think that is.. what I know it is.. what will it serve? We can't have everything our little ole hearts desire, not without a price and at this point in my life, the price for that bit of self satisfaction is not worth the rest of my life. Right now, I'd just settle for a bit of inspiration for my various muses...what I can't have in reality, I can find satisfaction in and through my imagination...   I need to find some time for roleplay in channel. I have a commitment there. It's just that I fall asleep so early lately and get up even earlier or my sleep is broken up with this or that. Something is making me restless and I need to deal with it. In other words, I need to get a grip, but how do you get a grip when your handle on life just broke? ~grin~

      Personally, I don't think I am the stereotype mother-in-law, then again, that's my opinion. I have only one son-in-law and thank the heavens it's enough. Basically, he's a good person. I call him Fertilizer Boy and shall hence forth be referred to as " FB". Why do I call him FB you might ask. I'll tell you. Since my daughter married him, there are times I have wanted to bury him in my rose bushes and use him for fertilizer. My mantra where he is concerned seems to be, " He's young. He'll grow up. We're all a product of our enviroment. There's still a chance". Of course, there is the fact that my daughter has to sleep with him (Gee, I sound like my mother about now) and I don't. She set her sights on him from high school. Several years and one daughter later, she married him. Like I said, he's a good person. He loves my granddaughter as if she was his own flesh and blood. He does look after the kids, my daughter has CFS and a host of other illnesses. In her own words, she's a poster child for medical problems. She's trying to learn to live with it, he's trying to live with it and I'm trying to stay out of it. Now and then though, I want to go "POW" straight to the moon. Oh, let me add here, my daughter is not blameless in all this and she does get an earful from me when I do need to say something.   Example: They live from check to check and scrape by. He went back to school on the GI bill and on his VA disability. Sometime over Thanksgiving, his brother (the one home from Iraq) gave him $1,000.00 to spend on himself. We don't know what the exact conversation was that took place between the brothers, but it ended up with FB getting a check for $1000.00. He didn't mention it to my daughter. She found the check when his wallet fell out of his pants and came open. Long story short, he bought himself a laptop AND borrowed an extra $300.00 from a friend to get it. The friend is suppose to get his money back via some rebates FB has coming to him. FB has wanted this laptop, he didn't really need it. Who needs a laptop really when you come right down to it? My daughter wanted him to have one but told him it had to wait until they could afford it. So much for that. Oh, did I mention that after she found out about the check, FB told her she couldn't tell me about it or his dad? Why? Because if they got into a financial emergency, I wouldn't help them out if I knew about it. Damn skippy. At least he kinda knows me.  Needless to say, my daughter advised FB that if and when my granddaughter's sperm donor ever coughed up child support, he wasn't seeing any of it, period...well at least a $1000.00 of it. She recently got some money from the county in relation to collections. True to her word, he didn't see any of it. He isn't happy. He also isn't happy that she didn't tell him when she got the checks. She reminded him that he didn't tell her about his check. Stalemate.   Example 2: When they lived here with us, he was a slob. They had to move out. They moved in with his parents. She was deemed the slob and could do no right. They got into fight one night and his father got in her face and yelled at her to shut up. FB let him. Then FB took their son and locked themselves into his parents room and wouldn't let her take their son with her when she came over to my house for the next night or two. When I came for her, his father made it abundantly clear that she wasn't taking the boy anywhere. It was a good thing I was on his property. His mother proceeded to tell me what an awful slob my daughter was and how my daughter spent money like it was water and was ruining her son financially. Not exacftly those words, but it meant the same thing. Needless to say, I told her what I experienced with their son and then we left, minus the baby, called the sheriff dept and found out her options. Like always, they worked things out, especially when he figured out that he was not going to get custody of his son. They always manage to work it out.   Example 3: FB is flunking a couple of hard college classes. Who's fault is it? His wife's. She always has him doing things. Well yeah. However in her defense, she tells him over and over to let her know that he has homework and she will make sure he has the time alone to get it done. Recently she found out that he could be doing extra credit to help pass. He's known it for awhile now. He hasn't done it yet. Why? Her fault. She has him doing things. He's known for many days, if not weeks now. No excuse. He rather play on the Playstation.   He can be an irritating little chit in a friendly sort of way. He buys me gnomes for my garden. I think gnomes are cliche. I accept them in the spirit they are given, with humor and friendship. He helps buy cards or presents for me and his input is pretty good. He loves his children and takes care of them as much, if not more, than their own mother does sometimes because of her illnesses. He stands by my daughter even though she tries his patience and his nerves.  My daughter is no angel. She can't even begin to claim sainthood. She could keep house better. She could do alot of things better when she's feeling up to par. She knows it too. There are more examples but I won't even go into them. Why is she still with him? She sees the good things. She sees the possibilities. I applaud her and I listen when she needs an ear to chew on. This is her life to work out, not mine. I've been there, gotten the t-shirt and shredded the damn thing, moved on.   As for me, I like my sanity, what little I have left. I stay out of it. I don't even offer advise. Most times when I think about FB, I still want that shovel.

      ....or was it intentional? I've noticed there are a lot of little things Mom forgot to tell me about and now that I am a mother myself, I'm beginning to think it was intentional. I think it's all part of that "just you wait" mentality. It's all part of the Mother's Curse, I believe. I'm referring to children in case I've lost anyone. Things like...   My daughter has a family of her own now and since she moved back up into the same town as I am, she calls everyday. Okay, let's be honest here, she calls many times a day. Sometimes I wonder why she called at all at certain times. When she doesn't call, I worry. Something surely has to be wrong, right? Now if I could just get her down to one or two phone calls a day   Maybe that's why I take vacations and only leave the room info with my kid brother and I turn off my cellphone.   My oldest son is also married, celebrates his first anniversary next month. He is one of the sweetest young men I know. He's thoughtful, kind, respectful and clumsy. If there is any way for an accident to happen, he'll find it. I usually get a phone call from him to say hi and find how are things are and then casually tries to slip in the latest accident of his. I use to worry about his happiness, but since he met his new wife, that is no longer an issue. I have no concerns where she/they are concerned. I don't get calls often from him. He is doing all the things a young person needs to do to get his new life on a good path and I don't mind that.   My youngest son seems to finally be getting his life together. He got out of a bad relationship about a year or so ago, moved back home and finally got his old job back. He's more mature and responsible these days. He's still a loving pain in the arse. I find ways to get even. I live to get even. He finds ways to irritate, lives for it, so things balance out.   The reason I went through all of that was to show they do have lives of their own, that keep them busy so why is it their timing sucks? Is it inbred in their DNA? I noticed it from the time their awareness kicked in... the " time to mess with Mommy" awareness. You know.. those times like... no one needs me until I head off to the bathroom because nature demands it type of thing or when I think I've finally carved out that time for a private relaxing bubblebath I've always wanted and EVERY-friggin-one needs a moment of your time just as you sink into that warm water piled high with bubbles.   I lived with the blissful ignorance that ONE day all that would stop. They would grow up, move out, get a life, a husband, a girlfriend, a wife and leave me in peace to have that bubblebath or just some quiet time to relax. Mom, in her sly " just you wait" silence, merely grinned inside. She knew, dammit, what I have finally come to realize, IT NEVER ENDS. Well, not until I shed these mortal clothes for another chapter beyond this world of reality and that just plain sucks. There are things here I want to enjoy...alone.   I catch myself muttering to myself, " If I knew then what I know now, I'd never have had kids. "   Yeah, right. Lust...love... it's all blind. You live in the moment and in a period of weakness, at some point, you decide to seal your fate and have..children. Life is never the same again. Life as you once knew it is never the same again. I've decided that I was a Marine in a former life... I've learned to adapt, overcome, improvise. Semper Fi.   And I am doomed... because I wouldn't change a damn thing. When I want privacy and peace, I'm now in a position to run away from home.... hey.. maybe we do regress to our childhood.. maybe it's my turn now to give them a taste of what they've given me all these years....   On second thought... I'll just send them the Mother's Curse. Let their children deal out my justice, after all, it will at least be, oh, shall we say, three-fold?

      I'm home and thankful to be so. Since I have been journalling the trip to Las Vegas, I guess it is only fitting that I finish it out, so here we go....  We decided to travel up Nevada for the trip home instead of reversing our path back up Calif. Truthfully, the hubby didn't want to chance crossing the Mohave and getting another ticket. Aside from that aspect, we wanted to see how that route was for the planned trip next year. The route was nice. To some it would seem boring but I found it less stressful....until we hit an area where there were high winds and sand storms. We were scooting right along when we came up behind a flatbed 18 wheeler hauling a M1 Brady tank, probaby on its way to Fallon. Did I mention the road is just a two-way? At any rate, the way ahead was clear, so hubby makes to pass. Halfway around the 18 wheeler, out of the sandstorm, with no headlights on, looms a white 18 wheeler, coming straight for us. At that moment, I truly believed I had met Death. There was no way I could see of us avoiding a collison of some sort, with us coming out of it, not at all. Somehow, and I am convinced of this, through Divine Grace, my mother's spirit, the expertise of my ex-deputy sheriff hubby and as much help as those 2 truckers could have provided under the conditions, I am alive today to be able to sit here and type this.   In retrospect, facing Death was not like seeing my whole life flash before my eyes. That little window of a scene moved in slow motion until the moment we actually moved past the tank's 18 wheeler and back into our rightful lane, then everything seemed to catch up to speed and returned my consciousness back to the fast pace it had left for just those few moments in time.   This leasson, whatever it might have been for me or my hubby or the tank 18 wheeler's driver, I KNOW there was one in it for that driver of the white 18 wheeler... drive through a sandstorm with your lights on..you never know whose life you could save. I hope he got it. I know that if the hubby had seen even a hint of headlights coming from the south bound lane, he would never have attempted to pass.   When we got home and I related the incident to my kid brother, he said something to me that has given me something else to think about when I have a moment to spare. He said, " Did you ever give thought to why it was a white 18 wheeler? Of all the colors there are, what were the odds of this one being white? " I don't believe in coincidence. Everything always happens for a reason, even if we don't grasp it and maybe never will. In my lifetime of travel on the road (and believe me there has been plenty) the number of white 18 wheelers I have seen, I could count on one hand and have leftovers. Go figure.   All and all, despite the tribulations, we had a good time. It was nice. It was enjoyable. I look forward to my return trip next year. Tuesday, we simply relaxed, did nothing, became mushrooms, sleeping when we wanted to, eating when our body demanded it..and Life.. including trials... is worth living.

      oh my..oh my.. oh my...we just got back from seeing the Tournament of Kings at the Excalibur Hotel here in Vegas. I got us front row tickets. Now, dinner was running late because they were short staffed. By the time I started to eat, I had a mouthful of cornish hen when young... well muscle toned men entered the arena in nothing more than black tights and well, basically a thong... thought I was gonna choke.   It was something my soul sis forgot to mention, thankyouverymuch. Other than that, we kicked up the noise and encouraged the others in our section.   All in all, we didn't do anything super special for our anniversay, but we spent it together and it's a nice gentle, loving atmosphere we're currently sharing... so, I'm out of here. More from the grove tomorrow

      Ever had one of those days when just one itty bitty thing goes wrong and it's all a downward spiral from there? Where shall I start?  I went to bed Saturday morning after I sent my last entry. I even went to sleep. The alarm clock went off a few minutes later. The hubby was not ready to get up yet. We got up and moving by 6am. What time we left the homestead is a whole different ball of wax. The hubby couldn't find his wallet. We finally found it and got out of Dodge about an hour later. Got halfway there and I called home. Yep, just as I thought, hubby forgot to pack my make-up case. Now, some might be thinking, why didn't I just do it. We do things a certain way... he packs the truck. I stay out of his way. At any rate, oh well to the make-up case.   Somewhere along one of the highways we were on, there was a horrific accident. One 18-wheeler and one compact car. I'm not sure what happened exactly, but I do know no one in that compact could have survived.   The Mohave Desert is quite larger than I figured. It's also flat. Hubby got a speeding ticket. Cop said he clocked hubby doing 95 in a 65. That would be quite correct. Good thing we found his wallet. Btw, did I mention, I was not leaving home without the wallet. Good thing too. He hasn't gotten a ticket in 7 years. Hot damn, Momma gets a new outfit equivalent to the price of one speeding ticket. He barely managed to avoid any more. Needless to say, we checked in around 8:00-8:30pm. We had to go out and buy a few things and pick up something to eat. By 11:00pm, I took an ibuprofen, 600mg and crashed.   I woke up this morning in time to watch the sun come up then dozed on the couch until about noon. That was nice for a change. We headed over to the Excalibur to pick up our tickets for " The Tournament of Kings" tomorrow night. We also roamed around and bought a few things to take back. We bought the grandkids swords and shields. Yea, verily, I say unto you, their mother is going to loved me for it...NOT. Then we took the tram over to the Luxor and roamed around there. Hubby has convinced me to to do the 3D thing of the Haunted House and maybe even the ride there, kinda like the Star Wars ride in theatre they have at Disneyland, at the Luxor tomorrow. He wants to do the 3D thing of NASCAR. I told him to go ahead, I'd puke if I did it with him.   We saw Penn and Teller tonight at the Rio. It was cool. Although I didn't like the part of putting the cute bunny in the wood chipper. Yes, I know it didn't really happen. It's always the short quiet ones that have a warped mind. Gotta love it.  Other than not managing to get into 2 car accidents, we're doing good and relaxing. We'll definitely come back. This time share was a good investment.

      Apparently I am not going to be allowed to sleep until we're on the road today. If our calculations are right, if I know my hubby, we'll be in Vegas in 8 hours commencing at 6am, that also includes a small stop to top off the gas tank. It will have to do. Once awake, the hubby has to drive. He may even drive the whole trip. We don't have anything planned for tonight so he can rest his back in the whirlpool tub once we check in.   So, why am I not asleep this early? My toothache. I think an internet friend of mine is on the right track. Since the tooth in question has had a root canal and I am guilty of crunching ice, mainly on that side, I think I overly stressed it. It wasn't hurting during the day but after a late dinner(and yes, E, I ate on the opposite side) and a hastily thrown together suitcase, I settled down to sleep and no such luck.   I am not going to let something as small as a toothache keep me from enjoying the next four days in Vegas. I am not a gambler and for this trip, not much for sight-seeing either. These next four days are for de-stressing, vegging and hopefully being creative before I am launched into our new working season. I am all right with that. The past three months have been stressful in making ends meet. Hm. Maybe I am not putting that right. It has been stressful worrying about the next month. Yet, some part part of me has always had faith that the Lady's Grace would be there. She hasn't let me down yet. Oh, I've had to work at it, nothing comes without a price, but.... I think the worst of it is over, at least financially. I do not care for roller coaster rides. I do not care for the " ant and grasshopper " analogy. So, this year, I make sure it doesn't happen again. The business shows signs of doing quite well this year and if I can incorporate the word " organization" into my hubby's vocab, I may even get to keep my sanity... wait... I forgot about the children... ok... how about a small piece of my sanity then? That sounds reasonable.   This early in the morning, all kinds of thoughts meander through my gray matter. Yes, I now have possession of " The Cell ". That's another blog for another day. Suffice it to say, I have a twin soul sister, Griffen QuickSilver, who lives miles away from me, several states away and yet, we have a hard time knowing where one stops and the other begins. We share much between us and with a few other ladies. Ahhh, now there's another topic for another blog, this relationship I have with some ladies. I am constantly amazed by it. I just have never had girlfriends I could count on, even if they are miles and miles away.   Ever had thoughts you wanted to put to paper and said to yourself, " Oh, it'll keep until later ", until later arrives and *poof* they no longer exist and you mentally kick yourself for not writing them down sooner? Well, that's me. So, hopefully, this journal will pick up some of those thoughts and if anyone gleans something from it, huzzah! If not, well, in and out. Do not repeat.   Hmmm, seems Morpheus is knocking, but you know something? His timing sucks. The alarm clock is going to go off in about 15 minutes, talk about a quickie if I consent.... then again.. maybe 15 minutes is better than nothing....   Laters gators!

      I sent my hubby off a little bit ago to carry out his Honor Guard duty at the Civic Center. He's looking quite handsome in his uniform. Yes, he cleans up quite nicely, thank you. Today, he does not just represent one branch of service, today he represents all veterans, those who gave their lives and those who are still here.   I read an article in yesterday's paper how the Dept of Veterans Affairs has one of the biggest budgets in our country today. I could go get the exact figures and quote them to you, but that is not my focus today. I also have read where veteran hospitals are being shut down around the country and others are being built. There are articles about the lack of prompt health care or even no health care for certain things. There was also a portion in the paper yesterday about a politician who questions if we, the people, should be caring for all the veterans' problems that aren't service connected. Can someone explain THAT one to me? How can anything not be service connected or service related? We're talking about an individual here, one body with parts. One thing always effects something else in the long run. My answer to this politician is, yes, we should be caring for our veterans, period. They offered up their lives, they went into combat, saw things, did things we can only imagine and some we can't. Many of them came home, forever changed and some never came home at all.   Here, in Shasta County there was a big stink about making a veterans cemetery, a cemetery for Lady's sake. All these people wanted was someplace to bury their loved ones' remains with the honor, dignity and acknowledgment they deserved and all the politicians wanted to do was argue over who the hell was going to pay for it. It took veterans, widows of veterans and other loved ones going to Sacramento and lining the Capital steps with urns and representative caskets to get these politicians off their crabbing and actually do something. Why? Don't talk to me of money. Yes, it's a necessary evil, but we all wouldn't be worrying about money if these veterans hadn't done their job. Maybe some of those politicians should take a pay cut to show their respect for service people who made it possible for them to sit up there at Capital Hill and crab about how to run our state, spend our money or make it possible for them to live comfortably in their neat, expensive houses and drive their SUVs or have that expense account so they can smooze some guy into voting their way.   Btw, we got our cemetery and with the federal monies promised, but not without compromise. At least now those widows will have someplace of honor to inter their loved ones remains instead of the urns sitting on their mantles at home.   For those who are griping about what a lousy President we have, including those who even now wear the uniform, at least give a moment of thanks for those who have gone before you and made it possible for you to gripe today. Say thank you for those who now work to ensure that we never have to live in fear of random acts of violence that has such vagrant disregard for human innocence and life. While you are at it, say a prayer that we never have to live with the threat that such terrorism as we experienced with 9/11 will never touch our shores again.    Human life is precious and war is a vicious evil necessity. I wish it weren't so, but until human nature evolves, there will always be someone with a great arrogance and a sadistic nature. There will also be the shining glory of courage, the belief that if freedom and peace can not be kept with talks, resolutions and respect, that there will be people out there always willing to defend and fight to the death if necessary to maintain and secure the gift of prosperity and freedom for all.   For those of you who have gone before, I thank you. I owe you more than I can ever repay. Because of you, I have children and grandchildren who have wonderful lives, children who have never feared speaking their minds or have the opportunity to become what they dream of. You made it possible for me to have my dreams. You laid down your life for me and mine that we might prosper in a land that is free.   For those of you who are now, May the Lady's Grace shine upon you and keep you safely so that you may return to your loved ones and bear the torch so all those who sacrificed so much will not be forgotten. Thank you for your dedication, willingness to serve and your faith in the very principles that this country is built upon. Thank you for believing in the necessity. Thank you for showing compassion.   One day there will be a time when arrogance and greed will be subdued before it can even come to any kind of dark fruition so that humanity will never have to bear scars. Until then, I thank the Lady that there are those who are willing to brave the shadows and secure the Light.

      Have you ever wondered what happened to someone from your past? It doesn't happen to me very often, more like once in a blue moon. I am not one to look backwards.  He was a MSG in the Army, stationed at Schofield Barracks, Field Artillery. I had never met a man like him before or since. As far as I can gather, he still lives in Virginia.  I was working for a prominent non-profit on Schofield back then. I still live here, in Northern Calif, where I told him I was going upon leaving the island.   Our story doesn't matter except for me to say that I hope he has found some happiness, some peace in his life. He meant a great deal to me back then and he will always mean a great deal to me. He gave me back a part of myself that I thought I would never recover. He gave me back faith and belief in myself. If things had been different, our lives would have been different. They don't grow men like him on trees and my Momma didn't raise a fool. However, that is all moot. Both of us at the time were going through so much turmoil and hurt. There was no other way for things to turn out other than the way they did. I know I was responsible for some of that turmoil in his life and I wish I could apologise for it, but I can't. I will not put myself in any way, shape or form, in his life again. It is better to let sleeping dogs lie. We're both different people today, I'm sure.  If I had but one wish to give, it would be that L.A. is happy. Some part of me wants to know that for a fact, because he gave me so much, much more than he could ever possibly know. I guess I'll just have wish it upon a star.

      If Jim Croce can ask for time in a bottle, I want to ask for some 7 year old energy in one. How do they do it? They get up early and don't slow down until it's time for bed, even then it's one last hurrah, a bedtime story.   I had such high hopes for today. Did I accomplish any of them? Nope. What did I do instead? I humored a little seven year old girl. We played, we baked (pineapple upside down cake from scratch), we sent email to each other, we watched the antics of Mr. Bear, Penguin and the Taco Bell Dog and had giggling fits. We colored pictures, I cut bangs and french braided hair. No doubt before she goes home sometime tomorrow I'll be sporting a colorful new look all under the guise of a makeover. Maybe I can apply as understudy for the Drew Carey Show. Mimi won't hold a candle to me. My little makeup artist is rather good at makeup actually. She should be, grandma use to design makeup charts and apply it for stage productions. She just likes to believe she shocks me and I let her.  My writing partner is an angel. I totally ignored him today when I had mentioned I hoped to be able to play. He's also the reason for the shared giggles and for that I could kiss him. A cyberhug will have to do.   Maybe today didn't go exactly as I had hoped, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. One of these days I won't be around to do these things any more and Mr. Bear, Penguin and Taco Bell Dog won't be either but somewhere will be a little lady who fondly remembers her Meh-Meh and how they baked pineapple upside down cake together, how a glass got accidently broken and no one got yelled at, how peanut better on a spoon tasted so good and how the simple antics of a sweet man she never met except through a computer monitor and a few stuffed animals brightened her day.   Good Night Mr. Bear. Stay away from that keyboard and sweet dreams.   Good Night, Sir Knight. Thank You from all of my heart.

      ( It isn't midnight, but hey, it's close enough)Today was filled with work, so I can play more this weekend, and today was filled with time for the grandbabies. The Grandson likes the plastic golf clubs grandma and grandpa bought (we're more commonly known as Meh-Meh and Papa. I got Meh-Meh because Pookie couldn't say Grandma and Meh-Meh came out, it stuck). The only near thing was yours truly dodging a swinging golf club. Hell yes, I yelled, that boy has a wicked swing.  If there were any tornado warnings tonight, rest easy, the darn thing landed in my livingroom.  I did have some deep thoughts rummaging around in my gray matter, even if it isn't my day for the Cell. That's okay though, I get an extra day...muhahaha.. I get the 31st and the 1st. Odd days, gotta love 'em. Okay back to the deep thoughts before I crash.   I have very few women friends. I have never been comfortable around women. The best I can remember was when I was a little girl, even then, I was a tomboy. Maybe it was because my father wanted a boy first and he got 'em last. He raised me like a boy. Maybe it was because my mom, whom I adore, never felt comfortable with displays of affection. Whatever the reason, the bottom line is I have very few close women friends and even fewer that I feel comfortable around being simply unadorned me.  The women I do call friends, I love dearly. They are funny, intelligent, insightful and just simply beautiful.   I can tell the seas are rough for one of my friends and I'd like nothing better than to talk to her about it but I'm not going to. It's not a matter of letting her off the hook per se, but rather the knowledge that I've been there, done that and learned something invaluable of myself. I want her to find it too. There is no one anywhere that can change her situation but her. All her friends can talk to her until they're blue in the face and in the end, the decisions, the choices, are hers and hers alone.  Life is about choices, good, bad or indifferent and in the end, it's also about tolerance. To the greater degree, we commandeer our own ship.  If I don't like something on tv, I turn the channel or turn it off. If I don't like something I read in email, I delete it. Life really is simple. Don't tell me it's complicated, it's not. Excuses make it complicated. Fear makes it complicated. Each of us has to decide for ourselves what we will tolerate and put up with and what we won't. If I am putting up with something that's making me bitch, then I better shut-up and quit whining because I decided to accept things that way. Life isn't easy. If it were easy, what would be its worth?  Over the course of 17 years I tolerated a lot. I made the excuses...I played the martyr.. I played the woeful drama queen... until I found myself backed into a painful corner and what does an animal do when it's backed into a corner? It finally has to fight its way out. It wasn't pleasant, it wasn't pretty and it damn well was scary as hell. I learned that I could be on my own and appreciate being alone. I worried about how to feed my family, keep clothes on their backs and how the hell I was going to fix the roof, but you know what? I managed it all and more importantly, after a time, I didn't hurt inside any more..not like that.. No woman and I mean NO WOMAN should go through that kind of emotional and mental pain. It wasn't physical. Sometimes I wish it had been, that would have been easier to deal with... slap a band-aid on it and suck it up. I knew how to do that..but to set about finding out who I was and what I was made of, that was a whole other kettle of fish.   Do I have sympathy for my friend? Maybe just a little. My heart hurts with hers. In the end, it's about each of us. This is an individual journey and we only get one shot at this certain journey. We either learn to accept and live with the people in our lives the way they are or we try to find compromises we both are willing to make or we move on. Bottom Line.  Friends are wonderful. They love us despite our faults. They listen to us bitch. They cry with us, they laugh with us, they reassure us. They are there when we need them for support and laughter and more importantly, for a reality check. They give us everything and let us get away with nothing. Truth hurts. Reality hurts. Love hurts. And all three Heal.

      She's back. I got my baby girl back this morning. She's a bit on the reserved side and skittish. She's afraid we're going to take her back there again. They gave her a pain patch and because she is such a mellow, good dog they weren't sure if it was the after effects of surgery or the patch that made her so quiet. The doc rather err on the side of caution. They also had someone with her all night to keep a watch on her.   You know, it seems like a lot of trouble to go through for an animal, not to mention the expense, at least, at one time I would have thought so. At one time there was no way I could afford that kind of care. My children are grown, they have money of their own so I can do this and besides which, these are my babies. They are like another set of kids to raise. Their capacity to love is so deep and true and selfless. Okay, so I have to make sure they get their goodies, but that's such a small thing to want in return for what they give us.   I took a wee nap finally and no, I didn't get any sleep last night. Ask my hubby, if you can understand him through his yawns. Poor baby.   EEP! I would write more but I better get off this thing. The sky above has opened up and I hear thunder.

      My youngest just turned 20 this past April. Good kid. Really. He has his quirks. He hates having his routine, in anything, broken. It unnerves him and I know it, that's why I try to soften the edges when I can. Getting him through my divorce after 20 years, moving to new place, out in the sticks no less and eventually finding someone new to share my life with has not been easy for him. He's done good for the most part. There were rocky sailings and eventually adjustments, but like I said, he's a good kid. Give him some space and time and he comes around. The other thing he doesn't like, typical if you ask me, is that when he wants to do something and Mom puts a stick in his tricycle wheel.   For instance, the other day I was taking a shower and he wanted to go hang with his friend after work. I have no problem with that. He doesn't pay rent or for anything else at the moment but paying us back for buying his car and making the necessary repairs. He's been doing that. He's almost got it paid off too. I am proud of him for showing responsibility. I think it has finally sunk in that he continues to have a few chores around the house to perform simply because he still does live here. Well, when chores get in the way of what he wants, he gets sulky. He knocked on my bathroom door and told me he wanted to go out with his friend. When I asked about his chores, I got lip and attitude. Okay, by now this young man is the third in line. Doesn't he realize I've heard it all before? I am not moved. Basically it went like this:  " Mom? I'm going out for awhile, okay?" " Okay. Did you do your chores already?"  " No, I'll do them when I get back. " (yeah right, we've played that game before) " No. Do them NOW. You're going to tell me you're too tired when you get back."  " Mom!" (insert long whine here as my name is drawn out) " Do it! " ( more low mutterings that my 'mom ears' hear even with the shower on) " Mom, you just want to control me all the time or something. "  " I'll buy you a dog collar for Christmas."   Silence followed by a wake of slightly stomping feet.  The chores got done.  His friends aren't sure what to make of me. The boyo quite fondly calls me a bitch. You must understand, it is not done in a nasty tone of voice or meant disrespectfully because if it were, all of my five foot one and half inch frame would be at his six foot frame and up in his face. He's been there, done that and doesn't like the t-shirt. I'll tell you why I don't mind it either.   I am a bitch. I earned that title fair and square and I take pride in it. Ask anyone.  Just ask my kids. ~grin~

      Well, the mid-week hump started off fairly well. My writing partner is about. He got some sleep and was chit chatting this morning. That is always most welcomed. I also so looked forward to getting my baby girl, Cheyenne, back. Well, we were told we could go pick her up at 4pm today. ~sigh~ I just got a phone call. They want to keep her until morning. It seems like she is still in a bit more of a groggy state than they feel comfortable releasing her in. So, they asked if they can hold her until tomorrow morning. What choice do I have? Her health is of importance here. They did reassure me she is doing fine, just groggy. I am not surprised, not only did they have to hunt for the foxtail but they did the chip insertion and spaded her as well. ~pout~ I will not be completely relaxed until I have her home. At any rate, Skip has to run out so I asked him to stop by and check on her. I also want to know if they found a foxtail.  My granddaughter is a hoot. My daughter and family have been living in a small 2-bedroom apartment, anything larger is so expensive around here. That was about all they could afford after FB got out of the Army. He got out shortly after the 9/11 disaster. So, everything went to hell in a handbasket as we all well know. This all means that the granddaughter, whom hence forth shall be known by Pookie, and the grandson (3 yr old) have been having to share a room. Well they are moving by the first of July into a ground three bedroom..huzzah. So, back to my point, if you can imagine how having two children share a room, a small one, both quite different from the other and being a boy and a girl. ~chuckle~ One day her mother was in another room, but had her 'mother ears' on. She heard Pookie whisper to her brother, who was being a pest, " Wait until I get my hands on you. " My daughter yells my granddaughter's name and in response Pookie yells back ever so innocently, " Yes, Momma? " Hehehehe. She didn't realize Mom heard every word until Momma gave her a lecture on threatening her brother.   Hubby just called from the vet hospital. He wasn't able to see Cheyenne because of an emergency with another dog, but was reassured that our girl was resting comfortably and being thoroughly spoiled by the staff and eating it up too. Tomorrow morning after 9 am. Looks like another long night. ~sigh~  Next subject: What to make for dinner

      Well, we took the puppies in, one got shots and my wee girl is staying in until tomorrow. The vet is not sure if she has a foxtail down her nostril or has sneezed it out but the concern is it lodging in her throat or being stuck in her nose. So, they'll put her to sleep and scope it. Now normally, I would not be so worried, but we lost our golden retriever after he underwent surgery at the same place. This vet hospital is very good and it's not a matter of my faith in them, but my fear. They are also, while she is under, going to spade her and insert a micro chip. She was such a good girl today, even the vet was amazed how well she sat still, most dogs don't. She is so petite, gentle and good. I'll just be happier once we get her back.   My concentration is shot, dammit. I also missed catching my writing partner online as well. I was sleeping. I'm just batting a thousand today. I think I'll call it a night and see if I can catch up on my sleep.   On a different note before I go... I must remember not to take my youngest's word for a good place to eat. I took my daughter there today for lunch. It wasn't a bad place really, just, kinda, blah...the food that is. The place itself is kinda cool, covered in veterans' memorabilia.. lots of history there.   So, journal.. it's one of those nights for me where I just call it a night, tomorrow's another day. Sleep well, people... until the morrow.

      Okay, here's the plan, start off small and work my way up. Think it'll work? I figure if I can get myself to blog at least once a day, maybe, just maybe, I'll get myself back into the habit of writing everyday. I know that writing is different, it feels awkward when I push myself but after a few false starts, I usually can turn out something decent. It may not be perfect, it may seem ~blech~ to me, but it usually isn't as bad as I think.   In the meantime, Good Morning, People! It's a lovely day here on my side of the world. Of course, I may just be loopy. I've been up since 3am. One of my babies (the shelties) has got one of those nasty little fox tails up her nose, I think. Those things worry me because they burrow in. I've seen what they can do between the toes of a dog and they will actually travel up the bloodstream or so I am told. She seems to be okay this morning, but a call to the vet is in order and a trip as well.   I'm out of here. I need to pick up the daughter for our two week ritual of getting our nails done and lunch.   Back later!

      It was great being in Camelot tonight. There was a knighting ceremony. The Hall was filled with people, warmth, laughter, a good time as well as having a solemn reminder of what Camelot stands for and what we hold most dear. I don't want to go into depth on any one thing tonight. The hour grows late and I haven't even eaten yet and I believe the rumbling I hear is a protest from my stomach. I will say this though, Camelot has been bogged down of late with darkness, high stress, frustration, high maintenance and even maybe arrogance. The channel is not arrogant but some of its residents are. It has been a memememe scenario. Look at me, I can solve anything you put in front of me. Look at me, I have all the answers, I can do anything. There is a certain lack of depth, a shortage of trails that show how a character grows as realistically as possible. Instead of all pulling together to save Camelot, there have been individual bids, in some cases, desperate bids, to pull her together and they have dismally failed.   Tonight.... tonight.. I saw Camelot as she once was, as I would like to see her again. A place where light and laughter rein... a place where, when adversity hits, all pull together to see her through. It should never fall upon any one individual's shoulders to hold her walls together. The duty lies within each of us that makes Camelot home.   Tonight, trestle tables were laden with foodstuffs and drink. There were flirtations, conversations, eating and making generally merry. We need pages to be pages, squires to be squires, knights to be knights. We need to see Nobles and Ladies, dragons and animals, common folk and fae folk.   To pull Camelot back from the mist she is quickly drifting into will take hard work, thankless work..there will be angry words spoken, disagreements..it will require faith and hope... much like I saw tonight...   Thank you good people of Camelot.. tonight I saw her glory once more..

      When I do watch tv one of the shows I never try to miss is, Extreme House Makeover. A crew of designers find a worthy person (or people) who so deserve to have their house made over. They send the occupants off for seven days somewhere with a cell phone and a laptop. Periodically, Ty calls or sends video conferencing to this people, who probably go into shock at seeing their home demolished or at least parts of it. Last night was no different. This show was about eight young people, siblings, who had lost their parents within two weeks of each other. The oldest two apparently had moved out on their own and when this happened, came home to take guardianship of their siblings. Without that sacrifice, the family more than likely would have been split up and sent to foster care. Their house was small for eight people, seven gals, one guy. By the time the Makeover team got done, there were eight bedrooms, a pool and a miniature golf course in the backyard. They gave these young people a fresh start on life. All the mementoes in the parents' bedroom were put into scrapbooks, some hung on a memory wall. There was a bathroom with seven sinks for the girls, 2 showers, a huge tub and two toilets. There was a bedroom and a private bath for the young man. I'm sure he was quite happy about that. Oh yes, and their mortgage was paid off too! The relief on their faces was heart wrenching and joyful to see.   I can't begin to detail the whole episode but it still stays with me today, moreso than any other episode I have thus far seen. It even makes me feel good to see the joy, the excitement and happiness on faces of people I don't even know. It's just the thought that out there, somewhere, are people who's lives are a little easier, a little happier and all because someone cares... even strangers.

      Yanno, I have a pet peeve(if you think there's only one ~snort~)....people who think it's not only their mission to educate us, but to save us. My biggest gripe at the moment? Obesity. I am by far so not the ideal stereotype woman. I am by far so not what is considered to be within the range of an ideal weight. There are many reasons I am this way, probably many bad habits picked up over the years. I am a product of my environment. I am a product of my genetic make-up. I am also a product of human injury and human experiences.  When I was much younger, I didn't care. Gravity hadn't gotten a hold on me and my mind simply didn't care. Nothing in this world comes without a price and it's one I am paying for now. Now I try to educate myself. I strive everyday to make some change in a routine that is as natural to me as breathing or sleeping. Some days, I do rather well, some are eh-eh and some are just a lost cause. Age, aging is a big help. I can't eat as I use to or what I use to, not without consequences and at my age, I am a big fan of comfort, that and I'm getting too old to ignore the consequences any longer.   I have no problem with people expounding the virtues of a more careful diet or what something is chock full of, what it can do to us if we keep using it or using it in large quanities.   What I have a problem with is people who have decided it is their life's goal to save us all. Who made you my keeper? Who died and made you my children's parent? Don't stuff your do's and do not's down my throat. Each person is responsible for their own health, their own decisions but at least, they are their own person in pursuit of their happiness. Does that little bit ring a bell? I think you'll find it in our constitution. There's this really cool thing called, freedom of choice. So it makes you wince to see some very heavy person walk down the street. What's it to you? Get a life, better yet, work on your own. There's your focus, a life of your own..go figure.   Your children don't have to be drinking that soda out of a soda machine at school. I got some news for you if you think removing them from the school is actually going to make the problem better. Better education and awareness can make them walk right past that machine, but removing their freedom of choice is only going to make them more determined to prove they are their own person. Hell, give them better eating choices and a better eating scenario at home. We really are a product of our environment.   Each of us controls how much fast food we eat or our young children eat. Give us the information, give us the facts, but don't start telling me what I should or should not be doing. Who made you my keeper?  I appreciate your concern, I do, really. I appreciate the vast volumes of information out there that can help me make intelligent and right choices for myself and my lifestyle. However, the next time you decide to save me from myself, don't. I am the captain of my own destiny and I like it that way.

      Usually around here (sometimes fondly referred to as 'The Zoo')Friday nights are quite laid back. I have the munchkins(grandkids)on Fridays. Our granddaughter usually gets to spend the night and goes home on Saturday. Our grandson gets to stay until about 8pm and then gets driven home. He's just a bit too much of handful for grandma to keep overnight yet not to mention my house is just too small right now. Plans are in the works for renovation. Tonight I don't have the kids. First off little Miss Thing got in trouble at school. She is currently suffering from end-of-the-school-year-itis. It's a syndrome that takes a perfectly sweet, good child and turns them into a brat. I don't have the boy child tonight either, Grandma is suffering from a migraine. Damn, I'm beginning to think I am due for a major overhaul, barring that, maybe they should just take me out and shove me in the compost pile and leave me there.  I got the hubby to take mercy on me and go buy some bbq tri-tip for dinner so I wouldn't have to cook. Tomorrow is an early morning(6am) because of the rodeo parade. I'm not going but I get up with the hubby, get the coffee on, get him out the door, etc.   My sleep is broken up, a lot on my mind, I suppose. I don't mind confessing I am worried about my writing partner.... not that I am going to lose him... just worried about him in general. We've been together for a few years now and that's saying something. He's also one of the sweetest, most dearest men I know. I worry. Hard on the heel of him is thoughts of Camelot. I just don't have the energy to go into it right now. Maybe I'll devote an entire entry to Camelot one day soon. Speaking of Camelot, I didn't get to formate those three parts I finished writing either. Maybe tomorrow morning. Right now I've got two mischievous pups sneaking off with the hubby's polishing cloths, clean and unused of course. Damn critters are sneaky and fast!  I have got to take stock of my life, realize what is important and set things to order and cut what is not, adrift. I need to make myself carve out time, a certain time, for writing. There's always some thing or someone who comes along and sidetracks me from it. I have to stop that. I would love to get a sequel to my(our) current published novel well on its way. Speaking of books, if you are reading this Mr.You-Know-Who, how are the archives coming along? Been working on them? Don't make me come over there and shake you out of that family tree. While Di is busy elsewhere, you can be making the most of this time to work on your manuscript. I will now scoot my soapbox back under my bed.   So, what am I going to do right this minute? After I send this? More than likely, I am going to gather up my cd player, a few cds, grab a glass of lemonade and sneak off to my bedroom. Hopefully, at some point tonight, I will emerge, log on into chat and spend some time role playing or if not, maybe whip out the laptop and put some of these dreams to words....  Now ask me what I really want... a roman bathtub, candlelight, mounds of bubbles in a scented bubblebath, a strong body to lean back against and two strong, big hands to rub these shoulders and the back of my neck until the 'world' retreats from my consciousness... hey, it could happen. ~grin~

      The hubby is a joiner. He will join this club or that club or organization... you get my drift. Innocent enough dontcha think? It could be. It's also a symptom of PTSD (Post Traumatic Syndrome). I have to keep eye on him yet allow him to have a fulfilling life. The line is not always clear. On the other hand, I am not much of a joiner. If I join something I plan to give it my spare time...and like... what spare time?!   Anywho... this weekend is Rodeo weekend. The marine corp league is entering a float for Saturday's parade. The hubby volunteered (yes, he does that alot too)some of our space to bring out the float so the crew can decorate it, which they did. Hubby is in the process of adding the final touches. Where do I come in? The hubby has to make two signs to hang on the float and he could not find any stencils for the letters he liked. Guess who volunteered to search her vast array of fonts, print up the words and is now sitting here outlining and cutting each of those little buggers out? Two sets! How did I get myself into this?   The other thing driving me crazy? All this last minute stuff and running around like a chicken with head's cut off....ARUUUUUUGH!  Okay... I did manage to do some writing today, about 3 parts worth. I just need to find some time to format it for the web page. Looks like that isn't going to be until tomorrow sometime..  Back to the alphabet ~growl~

      ..and trust me, it looks like a large hump to get over, already. We'll make it, that's for sure. The question is, how many aspirins will I consume before I get there? The PITA vendor is on a rampage again. I can't blame her. She's already paid the bills, she deserves her money. If I had it, I would give it to her up front and then worry about collecting it for us. It doesn't work that way. We're a very small company, very small. We have no overhead and given my husband's financial straits before we got together, a loan from someplace is out of the question. We usually don't have this much trouble. Our contractors need us and usually go out of their way to make sure we're taken care of. Bottom line to all this is, we're on it. We're doing what we can as soon as we can. I can offer nothing more except maybe to share my econo-size bottle of Excedrin.   The grandson is fine. They kept him for observation until 5pm last night. In the meantime my daughter managed to get the charcoal in him. ~shudder~ Save me from root beer and french fry incentives. Hey, it got him to take the charcoal, I am grateful.   Little brother came home for his day off down in Citrus Heights. He's a country boy through and through. He needed a home fix as he won't have another day off for about 9 days. The sister store to the one he works for is doing a remodel. They sent him down to help since his store is up for one next month I believe. He's about a 2 hour drive from here so it wasn't much of a hardship. He is working nights and doesn't have to be at work until 9pm tomorrow night. I know he'll be glad when this is over and he can claim his life back.   I'm not feeling too good, leftovers from the abscess tooth I bet, that and getting all the pain medication out of my system. ~blech~ I also have two little shelties to bathe today and it's suppose to thunderstorm again this evening. We're suppose to be going to Sacramento to see the hubby's oncologist on Friday, which means we leave here tomorrow, spend the night and then head back, but, we're going to see if he can be checked up on by his regular doctor here instead. The price of gas is through the roof.   Where's my compost blanket?

      be forewarned... my writing can not express at this moment just how livid I am feeling. About a half hour ago, I received a phone call from my daughter asking if I was going to be home and can I please go pick up my granddaughter from the bus stop as my daughter and FB have to take their youngest to the hospital. My daughter told me she would  explain later. I didn't bother to question her at the moment. I told her I would pick up my granddaughter. About 15 minutes ago, I got a call from my daughter, from the hospital. Apparently, FB was getting my daughter's medication for her(she was in the shower and it was one pill) and he set it down on a table or counter(I'm unclear exactly where the pill was set down)for just a minute and when he turned around, lo and behold, there stood my grandson and the pill was gone. When my daughter questioned the grandson(who is 3 yrs old)he just looked at Mom and said, " Sorry about your medicine, Mommy". My daughter was not taking any chances and they whisked the boy off the ER room, where he currently is. So far, the boy seems to be ok, but because they don't know if the lad took the pill or not, the hospital staff is going to pump charcoal into his stomach. I don't think the boy is going to voluntarily swallow it, do you? They may be keeping him overnight for observation.   My rant: I have TOLD and TOLD FB and daughter about 3 year old children. They are curious and quick little buggers. My daughter is usually very good about such things. FB is another matter altogether. Let me explain. FB will leave a sharp knife on the counter, within reach of young children. My daughter will come along and and get into FB's knickers about it. She'll put it safely up. FB's attitude? He'll only do it once. What she and I can't get through his thick head is, ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS ONCE! The type of injury that boy could suffer because of "only once", just the thought of it, pisses me off. Where does FB get such an attitude from? Remember me mentioning before that we are a product of our environment? Oh, you betcha, from his parents. FB's frame of mind is that the boy should know better, they have told him and told him, scolded him, punished him to leave such things alone. If the boy hurts himself, it's his own fault for not listening. Daughter and I have been trying to POUND into FB's head, you're dealing with a 3 year old toddler here. THEY DON'T KNOW BETTER! And even if they do, they forget. Besides which, if an ADULT had not left the damn thing out where a child could get to it, no one would get hurt.   Pills look like candy. Grandson, like most children I know, loves candy. Everything goes into his mouth lately. Recently, we thought the boy had swallowed a penny. False alarm that. However, they have been scolding him and watching him because all manner of things, even though he knows they don't belong there, are going into the boy's mouth. The boy is smart, he knows it's Mom's medicine. He's curious. He may have gotten too curious this time. FB is flipping out. Well hell yes, he should be. He is responsible for this. He is the one who set the damn pill down within reach of his son. Maybe his son wasn't there at the moment when FB got out the pill, but he was there soon after. Will FB learn from this? I bloody well hope so, but I am not holding my breath. Why? Because experience has shown that as soon as the crisis is over, FB will find a way in his own mind to blame everyone and anyone other than himself. I better not hear of it. I more than likely will go get my shovel and start digging.   So, I am soon leaving here to go get my granddaughter, whom I will take care of until FB comes to get her. I will remain civil and oh so quiet. Hopefully, that will speak volumes.   I'll update later.

      The last few days have centered around my mouth and the pain with an abscess under one of my teeth. Gratefully, I am now on the mend, but it was one hell of a trip. I haven't needed any type of medication since yesterday. However, what I have introduced into my system, is now working its way out. Working itself out isn't nearly as bad as dealing with the problem, but ugh! I hate feeling this bad. I've got things to do. Okay, so they're getting done slowly, a little here and a little there. I just hate it that my body does not bounce back as quickly as it use to. I think that's about the only thing I miss about youth.... wait... I could do without gravity too. No one told me gravity and getting older were best of friends.. come to think of it... it's not only gravity.. dayam.. there seems to be a whole orgy when I think about it. I'm glad they're having a blast, because I'm not. Still, growing old has it perks (and trust me none of those perks have anything to do with my body, more's the pity).   My knight in shining armour finds the time to send me email to open with my morning coffee. That leaves me all warm and fuzzy and sets a smile on my face.   I have friends and family....  Now... if only my body will behave itself....   I should be so lucky. ~blech~

      I admit it.. I'm addicted to crunching ice. Even as a little girl, I remember wrapping an ice cube in a paper towel and sprinkling it with salt before chopping it. Don't ask. To this day, I have no earthly idea why the salt. I just know that I make my dentist shudder and I can't tell you the number of lectures I've gotten because of it. Of course, if I had known that by my mid thirties that I needed to take a calcium supplement, I would have and my teeth would be a lot stronger today. The force behind a human jaw biting down is tremendous. I should keep it in mind.   About a month ago, just before we left for Vegas, I was chopping ice like crazy and somewhere during that time, I started to develop a toothache. I had oral surgery done on the tooth in question, namely a root canal. Over the Vegas weekend and in the ensuing week, my jaw started to feel better. Consequently, I started eating on that side again and viola, I'm right back where I started, maybe worse. On a pain level between one and ten, I'd say up until this morning, my pain level was a 9-10. Last night, I religiously took aspirin. This morning is the best I've felt in the last three or four days. My sleep could use improving, but I'll remedy that today. I do not want to go the dentist and have them pull this tooth and spend money I can ill afford AND money that can be better spent elsewhere than on my stupidity. So, if the worse is now over, I shall 1) have more patience with myself, 2) be more careful, 3) NO MORE ICE CRUNCHING. As for the third one, I'm addicted... I wonder if there is a 12 step program out there?  Everything has been put on hold because of this... my writing.. my role playing... business...housekeeping... Aruuuuugh! I'm under strict orders to behave today.. relax, get some sleep.. blah blah blah... I have work to do, things to do...although... mutiny at this point might get me into some deep doo-doo.   FB was going to come out yesterday to bring me some stuff my daughter had for my gums, stuff I forgot to pick up. With the way gas prices are these days, I said no. I'll manage. Bless his heart, he dropped it off at the house on his way to college. There are some days I just have to put my shovel away. I know he is tired. My daughter was in the ER late last night... she's fine or rather they couldn't find an explanation for the symptoms she was expressing. I still worry. Heart problems run in my family, especially my maternal side. Not a good thing. At this writing, all seems to be well. I pray it is so.   Collective thoughts are bouncing around in my head.. but said head hurts too much to make sense at the moment. Sooooo, I think I'll go do what the Captain ordered... at least for now.

      Everyday is Mothers' Day, it's just that sometimes..ok.. most times.. we don't get to have as nice a day as we do today. Some of us will get breakfast in bed... just think of it....a cup of coffee that has four tablespoons of coffee grounds in it because the kids are not allowed to use the coffeemaker and they wouldn't know how it is done anyway (this also goes for the Big Guy). There may be a bowl of cereal brimming to the rim, two pieces of bread, which have gone soggy by slopping milk from the cereal bowl and torn in places by the butter, a glass of orange juice which is now only half full because the rest of it is curdling the milk on the tray...and only a mother would not see the mess and eat her way through what is set before her then hug, kiss and thank those anxious eyes that are watching....   My children ordered and had delivered, yesterday, a butterfly teapot filled with flowers. I collect teapots. This one is absolutely gorgeous. The note that goes with it reads: " Mom, thank you for everything and your understanding. We love you!"   Affirmation... I love it.

      Over the last couple of months, no, make that, the last year, I have found it increasingly hard to role play in Camelot. Since my life changed, starting with my divorce, I have made it a point to be bluntly honest with myself. So, in this case, I asked myself... Why am I avoiding the roleplay and Camelot when both those things mean so much to me? Have I come up with any answers? I'm not sure yet. If I am blunt, one of the problems is a few certain people in the channel. Maybe they are judgment calls, personal judgment calls, but that's the way it is for me. I have found in the last couple of months I am not alone. The people who are driving me up the walls are driving others there too. There's got to be something to that. What's the solution for that one? Damned if I know at this point. What I am sure of is that these people or certain persons anyway, happen to be stifling the creativity of some. It is getting so bad that the whole atmosphere of the channel is suffering for it. I find it amazing how a channel on the cyberhighway can be so affected by the personalities of others and how that in turn affects the whole. Can't those in a position of power just eliminate the problem? For certs, however, would that merely be an abuse of power? Would it be mere vanity? The "thorns" I am sure are basically nice, good people but the bottom line is... they are PITAs (Pain In The Ass). It seems no matter how much an individual tries to talk to them, they just don't get it. No one wants to be responsible for hurting another's feelings, but dammit. Solution? I don't know. Short of getting rid of these people (by a general consensus and we'll all never agree on that I am sure), I don't have any answers except to stay clear. I don't have a problem facing or dealing with problem issues. Hell, I wouldn't have a problem in clearing the PITAs out, IF it were for the general good of the channel. However, while I may wield some power to be able to maintain the general rules for the channel, I do not have the authority to sweepingly go through it and clean it up. Come to that, who am I to make such decisions? The only solution may be to leave, which I would hate to do. I love Camelot and everything it stands for, unfortunately some there have turned the channel into an avoidance instead of a joy. I also know that there would be others to follow if I decided to leave, that was made clear to me last night. Right now, it's very tempting....  SO, where does Carl Sagan come into this? I received an email today with wallpaper for my desktop. It bore something he said and that is thus:   " Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were, but without it, we go nowhere. "   My imagination, my creativity, my Muse mean everything to me, without them, ~I~ am nowhere.

      Yes, today is turning out to be quite nice even though I was up all night reading The Da Vinci Code. It's a book I am enjoying quite a bit. Started it last night and I am almost done with it. I can see why it is on the Best Seller's List.   Later this afternoon the hubby and I are going to go over to visit friends of ours. They are an older couple who just got back from England and I can't wait to hear all about it. I always enjoy the time I spend with Jackie and Ken. They are a lovely, warm couple. I'm going over to help teach her how to use her re-write cd so she can make copies of pictures. She says she also has a million questions to ask me about the computer too. I guess this means I'll be working for my supper. ~smile~ I don't mind. The time passes so quickly when we are with them. She's making dinner and we're picking up dessert. Sounds like a plan.

      Celebrating May Day at the Ren Faire was very nice. It got a bit warm but a good time was had by all. I didn't spend money on medieval weapons this year, nothing spoke to me. I did find this wonderful windchime with blue bells and pentagrams. I just love the sound it makes. I just need to hang it now. It's been up in the 90's but it's cooling off today and for the week. This is what I was hoping for so I can get some work done outside. My herbs, in their pots on the front lanai are doing wonderfully, including my chocolate mint (that little dickens has been the bane of my life--it dies), I am surprised and well pleased. In order not to have a wild fire at my back fence again, we're creating a green belt around the property. Oh and speaking of property, I have new neighbors to the south. We'll no longer be the first house on the right. The nice thing is, they are building their house more toward the south east of their property so I don't think I'll feel crowded in like I do to the north side.   Work continues to be my master. This is not a complaint. The more bids we make on projects, the more bids we're likely to get a part of. That means money for our cruise this year. Didn't I mention the cruise? Last Decemeber we went on a 7-day cruise to the Sea of Cortez, Mexico. This year we are planning a 16 day cruise around the Hawaiian Islands. It is something I always wanted to do and it will also allow me to pay my respects to my maternal grandparents and my mother. Their ashes lie in the Puna Hongwanji on the Big Island.  On a less serious note, I want to buy a rice pot!!! Yes, I know they make them here on the mainland, but it isn't the same. I have orders for 3 of them ~grin~ These types of rice pots, that I haven't found anywhere but on the islands, steams rice to perfection and it can stay heated for a few hours. The one I brought with me from Oahu finally wore out and we eat alot of rice. It's the Japanese in  most  of us here.~grin~  FB: Oh yes, dear reader, did you think you would get off so lightly? I'm not about to spare you, my journal and hence, those of you who read it. We all remember who FB is, right? If not, check the archives. Okay, so let us dive into FB's world or the world according to my daughter.   Daughter dear has been diagnosed with CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) she has her good days and her bad. Lately, she's been having more bad than good. Now I can appreciate and understand FB's frustration as the  healthy  spouse. For the record, FB isn't all that healthy himself. He suffers from high blood pressure and allergies, which are bad here in the North State. He also suffers from a bad case of mememememe. Woe is me... why me... I'm-gonna-eat-some-worms-me. FB's greatest thorn is that family (as in us, his in-laws) don't offer to help out more. What it really boils down to is, why don't they offer to make my life easier? Believe me, I've taken a hard line with this one and FB in general. Daughter knows it and why. I could see my way clear to help out more IF FB made the effort to buckle down and do for himself and his without all the whining. Observation: FB would make a great Blues composer. Instead, FB rather blame everyone, especially his wife, for his woes and impending failures. FB is currently enrolled in college, working toward his degree in Business. FB is having a very hard time with Statistics and Economics. He seems to think he may be doing okay in Econ. He picks a fight with the daughter because he doesn't have enough time to study. He does have time to play his video game or help his father with dad's business. Believe me, I have nothing against him helping his dad, but that's another blog for another day and  dad  is a piece of work. Like I said, another blog for another day. FB is further suffering from frustration in trying to balance school, taking care of family and hearth (when it is necessary) and helping out his dad.   Like I said, I would have no problem in helping him out BUT (and there's always a but in there somewhere, isn't there?) FB would take advantage of it by assuming that the matter is taken care of and therefore, he doesn't have to make any kind of effort in that direction. Wrong assumption. One, FB has ticked me off in the past over stupid crap...two, I/we won't always be around to help out..and three, if he made the effort, knuckled down and drug himself out to do it himself, I would gladly help, but FB is basically lazy. He's admitted so much himself. Why put himself out over something he can get someone else to do for him?  I will say again, " We are a product of our enviroment." Guess where he got that attitude from? He has also told his wife that when he comes home from school and finds her lying on the couch, it reminds him of his mother (his mother has a host of medical problems, the forefront one being Wilson's Disease.) it's something he doesn't want to deal with. He doesn't want to understand his wife's medical condition, he doesn't want to have to assume all the responsibilities when it's time. I can't say I blame him, who does? But you know what? When you marry someone it's because you love them, because you want to spend your life with them, through sickness and health and for riches or proverty. It all doesn't matter because you love them. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, maybe there's a strength in me he just doesn't have, I don't know. I just know it's time for him to step up to the plate, quit being a whiner because there is no time for 'me' and do what he needs to do. That's what love is. You step up to the plate, you deal with whatever pitch comes your way and you don't whine or feel sorry for yourself. You just do what needs to be done because it does. FB makes me grind my teeth. My mantra is still: He will grow up, he is a good person, he really is.  I have no doubt about the love he has for his children. Sometimes, I even think he loves my daughter. He just wants to 'play house' his way and Life is knocking him around trying to get his attention. One of these days he'll find out that Life, reality, is alot harsher than those romantic vision goggles he still tries to look out of and one of these days, if he isn't careful, I'm gonna snap those things while they're still on his face...just like a rubberband. In the meantime, I'm going to go out and oil up my shovel...just in case.   Shift gears: Here I sit when I should be away from the chains of this computer if only for a little while. The day is beautiful with a nice breeze. Dang that hammock looks good. There's a spot of housework to be done, a bit of tinkering outside to do, oh, and look, my son the vidiot is home from work early. ~hehehe~ Hmmm... takeout pizza sounds good for dinner. I've decided. I'm closing the kitchen. Everyone cough up a couple of bucks.. who's making the pizza run anyway? What? No one wants to go? Fine. You all can starve. Personally, I have my glass of lemonade and my secret stash.. I'm not telling. It wouldn't be a secret anymore. My mother had at least two children with some sense.   You all take care. Have a wonderful day and if you are at the other end of the world where your day is winding down, enjoy your evening. Life is good.

      Oh my oh my oh my... yesterday. Sparks flew. I have come to the conclusion that either my hubby's memory retension is going to hell in a handbasket or he has immersed himself in so much of his extra stuff that things are slipping his mind. Needless to say, Troll and Sprout ducked and covered. Knowing me as well as they do, it was *poof* into the woodwork. I won't go into details, they aren't necessary, just suffice it to say that hubby and I got into it. In the eight years we have been together, we have never had a 'fight', they are more like spats. That is saying something.   We got the daughter, FB and the babies moved into their new place. We have to still go over there today to do some last minute stuff, like pick up some stuff that is going to the dump or coming over here. I shall, at a later date, devote a whole blog to FB's latest exploits. *eye roll*.   In the meantime my house looks like HELL! Between being laid up with this back problem (soft whispers again..shhh), helping with the move, nothing has gotten done. I live with three grown men and they all seem to have developed short-termed memory loss like, the dishwasher is empty, put your dirty stuff in it instead of the sink or uh, hello, the washing machine is empty, fill it. How about, there's the vacuum, is there anyone besides me that knows where the push button is to turn the dang thing on and it's really simply to  use, turn button to on, push, push, push, empty canister. I just don't understand. They can find the remotes, push buttons on it but they can't work the vacuum or the dishwasher? Someone please explain that one to me. No wonder I'm a mushroom. Two out of the three can cook, do laundry and clean. I know, I have three. I am beginning to believe Sprout is a lost cause. I have not given up on him however. My oldest son is 26 years old and he has learned to do more than eat out of a can. There is hope for Sprout yet. I know he can cook, inept as he may be at it, so long as it is something simple and he's really comfortable if there is a microwave handy. I know he can do laundry, all my kids were taught how. He just chooses to take the easy way out. He's lucky other people around here like to eat and that we also decide to feed him.  I've also come to the conclusion, there was STUFF mom forgot to fill me in on. I'm beginning to believe it was deliberate. That would have been right up Mom's alley.  Lady Bless, I miss her so.

      Well, perhaps not that bad. That little whisper before in regards to my back muscles cramping up? Forget it. Toss it out the window with the bath water. I am, however, not allowing it to slow me down until I have to. I have a new scent now. It's called, "Ben Gay". Monday is going to be interesting. The hubby is juggling his balls again. If he loses 'em, I refuse to accept responsibility.   Saw the kids' new apartment, smaller but functional. It amazes me that they get away with charging $850 a month for such an apartment. Something like that use to cost about $350-450 a month. I've lived in nicer for less than what she pays and in the same city too. Amazing.   Well the back is cramping up again. Relief was nice earlier. Time to go apply more of the old people cream. I am hoping to be able to sit and finish my writing tonight. Life should be so easy.

      I understand that normalcy is relative to whomever. Therefore this is my 'normalcy'.   Things are back to normal or at least pretty damn close. I am functional again. The knee still has a twinge but it's doable and the back (and here we whisper ever so softly) no longer has the choked up muscle. It felt great to sit at the computer today so much so I have accomplished some writing in the 2,000 word zone. Don't go looking for it yet. It's not posted to the web site as I am not done writing just yet. By tomorrow I hope to have the storyline all caught up. For anyone who doesn't know, I'm referring to the role-playing section of my personal web site.  We were suppose to help the kids move this weekend, yes they got the apartment approved and now have the keys, but guess what? Our truck's alternator has died. Burial services are scheduled for Monday morning bright and early to be followed by replacement. Nothing is sacred in this world, is it?  The Troll has been home for a week. That hasn't been so bad, at least he hasn't made me grow a new wart. That's the alternative to gray hair, don't you know. He did however, refer to me as old and that got him smacked with a plastic baseball bat. Troll is a big man and I had no idea big men could move so fast when chased by baseball bats. Speaking of Troll, his bearded dragon is on the lamb. No, not literally.. sheesh. Troll set his lizard out in a cage he didn't think the lizzy could slip out of. Surprise. From my best guess, the bearded dragon lizzy is somewhere under the house. Troll seems to think the lizard has slipped away and is long gone. The betting pool starts tomorrow. Either the lizard is under the house eating bugs and spiders and such and will one day emerge as a komoto dragon OR the cats will eventually drag out some lizzy bones to gnaw on. Now why doesn't anyone go under the house you might wonder? You would not send your worst enemy under there... okay.. wait... maybe your worst enemy only. We're not sure what is growing under there, what has previously died under there or ever heard that saying, " What the cat drug in?" Uh-huh. I rest my case.   The prego kitty who sleeps on the coffee table has not downloaded her kittens yet. We're still in limbo there. There's a family betting pool going on as to how many and where she'll drop 'em. You know, my family bets on the strangest things. They don't seem to have a life.  My hubby, the red-neck, and yes he admits to it, tried to use the old cables to charge the truck battery the other day. The negative side only had one rubber handle, the other one got lost somewhere. He tried to use it anyway and whined when he burnt his finger. He then went to Sprout's car and removed a roll of duct tape (makes you wonder why Sprout carries duct tape, doesn't it?) and proceeded to wrap the one end of the cable missing the rubber handle. Okay, will someone explain to me why he thinks that would do any good? HELLO! There's a reason why the cables have rubber handles. I had to walk away. His life insurance policy is good until Aug. 1st before we have redo it. This is the same man who just has to touch the hot wire to make sure it is working. One too many times, I swear. I also have to wonder if that's why his heart is still in good shape. There's this vintage cartoon called, " Pogo " (did you like how I handled that one? Vintage. I'm good.) and I swear to you all, the hubby was the role model for that little dude. He has a little black cloud over his head and he gets these electrical shocks. The hubby gets them so much, between you and I, I think he's beginning to like it.   normalcy..yep yep..it's back and me with it.

      The light dawned bright and promising early Sunday morning. It was Father's Day. Having pondered what could be done to celebrate it, something different from just going out to eat, the mushroom had a wonderful idea. After consulting with the Troll and the Sprout (henceforth the youngest child shall be nicknamed), who also thought it was a good idea and between them decided who would pay for what, it was decided we would all make a trip to the local caverns. Now the mushroom had lived in this grove for the most part of her life. She had ventured out to explore new things, but always came back to the Grove. Something she had never done was to completely explore her own backyard so the caverns seemed like a good idea.   The leisurely stroll down to the waterfront to board a party boat for a quick trip across the lake was very nice as was the boat ride itself. The climb up the ramp to the the bus would have been a bit easier if someone's grandchildren (not mine) had not slowed down and nearly stopped half way up. The mushroom was on a stride you see and slowing her down like that caused her to suck wind in a not so pleasant way. It was a precedent of things to come to the unsuspecting mushroom. The winding bus ride was enjoyable up the mountain. Of course, the mushroom didn't look down the scenic 80 foot drop to the lake level. This mushroom gets vertigo.   At the top of the mountain everyone disembarked into the visitors center where people took a moment to see the displays, use the restrooms, get a drink of water. Then the guide came, a pretty YOUNG thing named Lisa. She was entertaining and the mushroom was impressed as this was Lisa's third day on the job and all the things she had memorized from the handbook, in such a short time, was definitely impressive.  The easy part was entering the caverns. Lisa saved the more important issues for later, once you were hooked by the beauty inside. It wasn't her fault. She did offer to take those who felt they could not make the climb back to the visitors center. Of course, the mushroom is in no way going to admit that maybe the climb would be too rough for her. Hell no. Stubborn 'shroom. So, it was in the second chamber or was it the third that Lisa advised that the next stop would be after a steep climb of about 130 steps. We had already done 30 steps then 80. What's in a number? The mushroom made sure she was at the end of the group. There was no need to hold up the younger, more long-legged, less plump members of their group. Ach, no one can claim the mushroom is not a game 'shroom. She started up those steps like a real trooper. Half way up she had to stop because she was sucking wind or trying to, into her lungs. She ignored the burning sensation in her recently healed knee.   " Only a little more, " she would whisper to herself, sigh and trudge upward. At the next  room she would scurry to a bench and plop down, quietly inhaling oxygen as fast as her body could absorb it, knowing that the worse of the climb was over, forgetting that there were more steps to climb but not nearly as rough. Finally, she trooped into the cathedral room and gratefully found a bench. Sprout at this point nearly got thwapped with her purse because he was being a smart ass in referring to the mushroom's age and prowess.   The climb was worth every inch as the lights were turned on and showcased the walls and ceiling. Gorgeous, simply beautiful and the Lady was hiding this? What else is she hiding, I wonder? The mushroom watched two bats fly about as pictures were taken. Then there was the descent. Lady Bless. How could the 'shroom have forgotten that? What goes up, must come down. The climb up via sometimes narrow steps and narrow passageways (sometimes of which Troll had to turn sideways to get through and even then he scraped his shoulders) were nothing compared to the climb down or maybe it just seemed longer because by now the mushroom was fading fast.  Mental note here: One really should ingest something more than 2 cups of coffee before becoming so active.  Alas, alls well that ends well. Back at the visitors center, the Sprout sat on a post waiting, like a cat out for a morning sunning. The mushroom damn near knocked him off it for his sass. Unfortunately, Sprout is considerably younger and moves far more quickly then the fading 'shroom. That's all right. The boyo will get his. He knows how cunning the mushroom can be in her vengeance. She'll lie in wait. She is patient.   This morning's light found the mushroom locked in stiff muscles, a present from her great adventure. Moving is a chore and painful. Still well worth it. However, it is not a trip she plans to make again. If she wants to see the caverns again, she'll visit her scrapbook. The pictures will be worth a 1,000 words and you can take that to the bank.

      55,104.... it's a number, a large number. I tried to imagine it as marbles in glass jars. I couldn't, let alone imagine that many human beings.   It starts with a very small panel near the ground, made of black, inscribed with a few names in white. The next panel is a bit larger, not much and inscribed there are a few more names than were on the panel before it. It was a gentle slope, spiraling upward and at the apex of this slope were inscribed the most names, rows of them, side by side. All told there are 55,104. So many lives given, so many still unaccounted for. Lying in tribute along the base of these panels I saw bibles, messages slipped inside plastic baggies. Some held pictures of images of babies and people, dogs and parents. Some held pictures of the serviceman who's name is inscribed on a panel of The Wall. So young. So full of hope and dreams, that is what that photo captured yet as I stood there reading, I couldn't help but wonder what that serviceman felt over there, so far from home in a hostile environment so alien from anything he had ever known. Two things hit then: One, his name was on The Wall and he was now in a far better place and two, what of the men who came home? Some of them are called "The Living Dead". Their minds can not leave that place or the people. Some of them can not live in today's society and have retreated to the forests to live off their wits. Some of them wander the streets, muttering to themselves.   There is such profound silence as I walk along the seemingly neverending black panels. The silence echoes off The Wall or maybe, it resides in it. I watch the men who survived this war, men who returned and were hailed with taunts, anger and hatred for what they were sent to do, for what they did to survive, for things done that we safely here could not possibly begin to comprehend let alone understand, stop and hug each other, friend and stranger alike, for they are Brothers. I watched these men with tears in my eyes as they knelt or crouched in front of a panel and lovingly ran their fingertips against a name. There was a history there I could not hope to know but I could feel their loss.   One man crouched in front of a panel, taking his time, his finger continuously rubbing one name on the panel. This man was a plane captain and the name on the panel was that of his pilot, who never returned from his last mission. Apparently the plane captain and pilot had a minor falling out and the young plane captain said some harsh words that included wishing his pilot never came back. His pilot never did. The young plane captain never meant those heated words, wished them back almost immediately. To this day, those rash heated words, spoken by a young plane captain on a flight deck all those years ago, still haunt him today. That young plane captain went on to serve 3 tours in Vietnam and became a corpman assigned to the Marines. There are also memories of injured servicemen he could not save. I am sure somewhere there are men whose lives he did save, but these are not the memories that haunt him, only his own inadequacies. The memories do not come as often now, but they still linger in the back of his mind I am sure. He is hard on himself when he does think of them, it's all part of the guilt he feels for coming back alive.  That young plane captain was,is my husband.....  For all things there is a purpose. I don't have to remind him that he is alive to remember and to keep the memories of those precious sacrifices in the minds and hearts of all today. He is here today to help lay to rest, with honor and dignity, those of his brethren who have also lived beyond that time and now go on to better things.  Someone has to remember....  Someone has to remind us all that every person deserves to turn their face up to Freedom's Light and bask in it.  Someone has to remind us that Freedom comes with a high price and that there are those willing to give that price because their humanity is greater than their own fears.  55,104 servicemen gave to their country because it was asked of them.   I honor them and the tears I shed that day were not for the servicemen who are lined on those panels, they are beyond our reach and no longer need our help, but for the men who came home to live out their legacy.   And somewhere out there, is another pilot, related through marriage, who is still listed as MIA, shot down over Hanoi. One day, you will be accounted for. We have not forgotten.

      It has been a good weekend. Saturday we went to pay our respects to our fallen and missing heroes of the Vietnam Era. We went to the Traveling Wall. Today, Fathers' Day, Happy Father's Day to all the Dads out there, we went to Shasta Caverns. This mushroom is a stubborn one, when visiting the caverns one will walk up about 800 feet at the top and then of course one needs to walk back down. They did offer to take those who couldn't make it back down so they could wait in comfort. *snort* As some of you know, I had a knee injury about 3 years ago and reinjured it about a year after that. This past year is the first year it has truly mended without further damage *knock wood*. The gist of it is, I have overtaxed it today and now paying for it. I don't care. It was well worth the trip. It is possibly, oh hell, IT IS going to lay me up for a couple of days. Of course, I didn't even think about taking my cane or using my brace.  Errands to run on the morrow.. an early night today with my knee elevated and hopefully after being a good little 'shroom, I will be able to sit down and write my thoughts about this weekend.... then again, maybe not... the grandbabies will be here. Hm, Troll is on vacation this week. He's pretty good about riding herd on them because obviously I can't this week. Maybe I will get in some writing time if the knee will allow it.   I hope you all enjoyed the Summer Solstice.

      It does not appear to be an oncoming train! I am cautiously optimistic as I write this. The hubby went to a business workshop today and it was productive, very. In a nutshell:  1) Our business qualifies in a special category because most of what we order is special order items. This would make allowances for the materials to be ordered by us and sent directly from the factory. The person he talked with from the Sac. office is going to work with the hubby to fix this, to include hand walking it over to the appropriate office.  2) We have just found out today that as a DVBE we have the right to be classed as a DBE as well. This has been in place over a year and a half ago. That means we missed out on a whole season of work. So, the hubby will be working on that one too.  Hubby asked the State Rep that was there today about this whole matter since we just spent an ungodly amount of hours making sure they got all the paperwork they needed to clarify we still qualified as a DVBE Supplier, told we did and then this happens. Why? Apparently in recent months new DVBEs have been qualifying as a DVBE, people who should not have. This has set in motion a crack down of sorts. The snare, unfortunately, has also caught the innocent ones.   So, to straighten this all out may take a week or two. The hubby has to call down to Sacramento and set up an appointment, fill out some paperwork, gather some information and then get down to Sacramento. If all goes as promised, if all goes well, if the Universe will smile and the Lady's Grace shines, a weight will be lifted. It'll mean more work, but you won't hear me complain at all.   Keep a good thought, will you?

      *whoosh*.... that's how I feel at the moment. No great pearls of Wisdom, no expansive view point, no insight from the Mushroom tonight, come to think of it, not even meaningless chatter.   I believe I fell asleep a little after 8 pm and only just woke up about a half hour ago. I'm not sure if I am going to be awake for awhile or go back to sleep. Dishwasher is loaded, coffee pot made and set for tomorrow morning. It's still pretty warm outside. The compost pile has pretty much settled down for the night. I am looking forward to some alone time tomorrow morning. Everyone else is off to work or to a workshop. The weather is also suppose to be a bit cooler. I'll believe that when I can feel it.   I do have some random thoughts I want to address on some things I've read lately, but not tonight, at least, not at the moment.  Nothing witty or funny or clever to spout, so this little mushroom is just going to turn the lights out.....

      I swear, it's a male thing. Okay, so there are a lot of male things, but I'll preserve some for later blogs.  The male species suffers from short term memory loss when it comes to domestics. One minute you can remind them to put a used bowl in the sink and run water in it. Not even two hours later, they bring out another bowl and leave it on the counter for you to find. What? Did they lose their sense of direction as well? The sink is merely a hand span away, but the used dish didn't make it there, let alone get filled with water.   It's the same thing with Time. Most men I know wear watches. Now can someone explain to me how come a man can look at that watch all day long, make it to his meetings on time and heaven forbid he misses his lunch hour, yet, he calls you on the cellphone after work to let you know he is on the way home and two hours later he's still not there? Did Hansel forget where he laid the breadcrumbs for the homeward trip? Did the birds eat them? Or did he merely consume the bread himself? And please don't even try that line of, " I lost track of time. " There's a watch on your wrist, buddy. I know you look at it. If I lost track of time where dinner preparation was concerned, there would be a major sulk and I've got news for you, that pout is u-g-l-y.   I've heard it said men make good map makers. They're the only ones who understand the concept of one inch equaling a mile. So, why do they hate to stop and ask for directions when they know they are clearly lost? And how come it's all right if they badger the female in their life into doing it? To make matters worse, a little while later you get to hear all about how they knew where they were going all along.   Why are men so lost in a grocery store when you give them an explicitly written list? It's got every bit of information on it they could need. The only thing missing is a picture. They can locate the potato chip aisle like a homing pigeon however.   And you want to know the worst of it? No matter how hard you try, no matter what you do, your sons become the same way.   It's gotta be in the DNA I tell you.

      When it rains, it pours....  Daughter and FB's car is now sitting in the front of their house with what I can only guess is a broken water pump. I had to calm daughter down because she was ranting how they just got it out of the shop. She found it funny that this had happened so soon from having been in the shop and told nothing was wrong but a major tune-up was needed. I had to tell her that this was not something they could foresee. They have one of those older car models, no computer on deck. They can not afford to have this happen and unfortunately, we are not in any position to help them. The hubby went to go make sure it was the water pump, picked up FB and found out the car had been towed. Wonderful.He did get lucky, it only cost him $75.00 to get it out. That was $75.00 they could ill afford. Daughter ended up borrowing the money from her youngest brother. They still have the problem of fixing it. They don't have the money to do so themselves, not with the move coming up at the end of the month. FB is going to school. He has to attend school or get a job or they have no income. Their rent is paid via a state program. Bottom line, he'll have to find some way to get the money, buy another water pump and install it himself. Luckily for him his father-in-law has the tools he will need and the experience doing such things. It's still going to be a knuckle breaker for FB. Think that's all? FB is also on academic probation. He's grade point average falls short of 2.0. It's all his wife's fault. We won't go there.   Hubby and I have been brainstorming over this problem the state has handed us. It comes down to having a 'yard' for inventory. There are two options to that one, 1) rent the space from his ex-partner or 2) use some of our acreage for storage. We have about 4 acres to use. I'm letting hubby work that one out. As far as materials go, sounds like we may have something cooking in that area too. He has to go see the man later this week.   We found out that not only has this new change affected DVBEs but all businesses, DBEs, Women Owned, Minority Owned, etc. There are some people out there in the same boat. We're not so bad off as some of them are.   I still believe that there is no problem that can not be solved by a little hard work, ingenuity and Divine Grace. Ask me that again in about a month, will ya?  I don't know what the Cosmos is doing, maybe it's burping. I give y'all fair warning right now, buckle your safety belts, just in case...I think the ride is going to get a little bumpy.   The last few days have passed so quickly and the nights even faster. I feel like I have accomplished nothing. It's an unsettling feeling to say the least. No matter what I do, it still feels the same. This too shall pass. It isn't the first time I have felt this way. I'll ride it out. I get the feeling there is something I need to be doing. I just wish I could figure out what it is.   In other more mundane matters, the weather is heating up here in the Grove. It is now approaching the 100's. It's so dry this year. We didn't get the rainfall we really needed, which means working dang hard to make sure no fires come close. I've gotta get out there and get that green belt going around the house. We still have not had to install the air conditioning window units yet. The swamp cooler seems to be holding her own at the moment. Fortunately, I don't need o turn it on until mid-afternoon and it stays on until after midnight. All the bedrooms come equipped with ceiling fans so that also helps. Huge electric bills I can do without.   Well, I best see to putting out the lights in the hovel. I ended up falling asleep in my rocking chair and just waking up moments before I started this post. I've got some reading to catch up on in.   May Divine Grace settle upon your shoulders like a true friend, the promise of a new day bring a smile of hope to your new day and may you always remember that there is no problem that is insurmountable and there is always someone who cares...   Good Night.

      Let me start off by saying that this is not a whine. It is merely a chronicle of the latest happenings so that one of these days I can look back and say, " Hey that wasn't so bad. "   Where do I start? Business. The people in Sacramento whose job it is to run this state, have been amending legislation. They mean well, it benefits the Disabled Veterans, it truly does, but in practically, it has been creating more problems. In our case, it's going to mean redefining how we do business. We have spent this past week talking about it a little.  He has a plan, now we're waiting to see if it comes to fruition. If it doesn't, we're going to lose the business, plain and simple. I have a couple of things pending in the back of my mind that I need to research on the net.   Another avenue is for me to go back to work. In one aspect, this would be a good thing. I need three more quarters to be able to collect social security. I could collect the quarters via self enterprise, but we can't afford that. Working would definitely be the answer. On the other hand it would have a devastating affect on my hubby's self worth if I did. He has prided himself all these years that even though he is disabled, he has been able to provide for me even with some help from me. My youngest has also told me that I am not going back to work, bless his heart. Like the Troll said to me last night, " Things will work out. " I wouldn't mind doing web page designs but I am not proficient enough in this area for my comfort. I also don't think I have the mentality for it...clean, clear, concise and uncluttered. I'm too much of an artist, I think. I am not happy unless I am cluttering up things. *grin*  We also discussed whether or not we can be okay without the added income. I didn't gloss it over for him, for the next year and a half, it will be tight. I have been tighter than tight before, try stressing over whether or not you'll be able to keep a roof over your children's heads and food in their belly, that's tight. We'll be ok.   I love writing. It's the soul of me. GQS and I wrote a book of erotica, it's now published material and we got our first royalties check, all twenty-five dollars  and sixty four cents of it. Don't get me wrong, I am pleased as punch, but like I told the hubby the other day, don't count on me to make us rich any time soon. *chuckle*  This past week, I have been tied up in the funeral of Ronald Reagan. Yesterday when he finally came home to rest, was so...so... well, it reached out and grabbed me, especially Mrs. Nancy Reagan. She showed us the Grace of a First Lady, allowed us to see a woman who loved her husband devotedly, and showed us vulnerability. I pray that the Lady will continue to shower this lovely woman with Grace, give her strength and hope. For no matter what your opinion is of Mrs. Reagan, one thing can not be denied, that is her love and devotion to her husband.   In about two weeks I will be helping my daughter and her family move. I am so looking forward to that...um-hm, right. This should be only a mild headache, but I know my daughter. That is two weeks away though, today, I shall attempt to clear my mind with thoughtless work, like puttering around the house, inside and out. I don't have to think. I can just use my hands and it helps calm and center me.   One more thing, the cat is pregnant. All my animals, save one, are fixed. This was a rescue kitty my daughter begged me to take. She couldn't have it, so I did. What can I say? I'm a sucker for cats. When I first took her, I wasn't sure how old she was, too young to come into heat though. Somehow, time has flown by me. The hubby started to say the obvious thing, " How did that happ-"   Me: If you complete that sentence, I'm gonna smack you. YOU KNOW how that happened.  Him: *chuckle*   So, I have a preggers cat running around here. I need kittens like I need another hole in my head.   In the interim, I wonder what the price is on stock in aspirin?

      " Sissy! " The whisper snakes into my dreams on Monday morning at 9am. I whimpered and pushed it aside, but it would not be denied.  " Sissy! Get up! "   Nooooooooo. I don't wanna. I don't care what I promised. I hate shopping. I hate going to Wal Mart and Goddess knows where else the evil troll will drag me. I can always be assured when traveling with him, it's more than one store.   " Sissssssy! " Damn evil troll! A pillow is flung in the general direction of the bedroom door. I could hear his evil laugh as he disappeared. I flung back the covers and got out of bed. I just knew he was capable of getting a supersoaker, brother-in-law, not withstanding. Although, I would like to see what would happen if Troll Breath did use one of those things and got the hubby instead.   The Evil, nasty little troll even took me out to breakfast, like that was going to make me more amiable. But he KNEW... oh yes he did. He knew that a cup of coffee would go a long way to making me feel human and drag me back from the land of 'I-don't-wanna-return'. Evil, nasty, little troll. I love him. He's my kid brother and the only one of my siblings I lay claim to. He's a darling and a gentleman. He grew up in this house, it's his home. How did he get that nickname from me? We went to the bookstore one day and I swore I was not going to walk out of there with a new book, I had plenty. I did not count on him. He found a book called, " The Last Pendragon " by Walter Goodwater. A good read if you are curious how the author sees the times after King Arthur. He was 15 when he wrote the book. I enjoyed it. Back to the troll. He came around to where I was browsing books and handed it to me. I HAD to have it. I looked at him and called him the Evil little nasty troll. The name stuck and it's his new pet name from yours truly. He laughs.   You just never know what The Grove will turn up.

      I have had netscape uploaded for some time now. I decided to try it and see if I can get blogger to come up right for posting and it does, which tells me it's my IE settings. Now... if only I can figure out which ones aren't set. Then again, the way my luck is running of late, I'll just use Netscape for now until my patience returns.

      It all started with the purchase of the webcam and it went downhill from there. The webcam still won't finish installing, btw. Then I had to remove and reinstall my printer software, THAT FINALLY installed all the way. Now I think the Norton Internet Security thing is acting up because when I tried to get here, to create a new blog all the boxes are scrunched together. I tried access from another computer and it's fine so it's this one that's giving me fits. I daresay I'll get it fixed. I just have to figure it out. I AM NOT a techie.   The Vendor from Hell left a message on the answering machine earlier in the week. She wanted to know why his (the hubby's) wife insisted on short-changing the invoices. Call her. Pardon moi? I was livid and the hubby knew it. My job is to process checks and pay the bills. He does the invoices, posts the payments and all the assorted stuff related to making this business work. I did not appreciate her assuming that I was at fault here and neither did he. He called back the next day, she was out, but he made his displeasure known. I mailed the short-changed amount, all $43 and some odd change.  Think that's the end to my week? *snort* hardly. Yesterday we're informed by CALTRANS that according to the new amendments that we do not meet the criteria as a 'supplier' for CALTRANS. It all bases around the phrase, 'commercially useful'. At any rate, we've sort of come to a sort of standstill and I am not sure what lies ahead. I have some research to do and the hubby says he can meet the criteria within a week. We'll see.   I get the grandbabies today. It happens to be my daughter and FB's anniversary and I took the kids so they could go out.   OH yes! I forgot to mention a few moments ago, the evil little troll (I'll fill you in on who that is later) went to take a shower and had turned on the hot water. The faucet apparently popped off. He was lucky he got out of the shower without burning himself.   I really want to say that sentence, but I refuse to tempt the Universe to do anything more.  Someone pass me my compost blanket and my fuzzy slippers. *whimper*

      From somewhere deep in the Grove, in her little tiny patch of compost, the Shroom stirs. It's Sunday. She looks forward to her peaceful, quiet Sunday routine. She yawns, she stretches, scratches in the most absentminded manner then stumbles through her tiny little hovel to the front entrance, all the while avoiding object de` art, curtesy of the little furballs she keeps as pets.  The front door is opened minutely, just wide enough for a hand to slip through and snag up the morning paper. Oh, good, the day's supply of fodder for the compost pile has arrived. Another yawn erupts and the door is closed tightly to avoid any intrusion of the profusive sunlight that seems to be streaming everywhere outdoors.   Shuffling sounds resound through her tiny domain, pinpointed in the direction of the kitchen and the coffeepot, must have coffee for survival. Through squinted eyes the coffee finds it way into a mug, creamer is added and a hasty stir is given before she places the morning's delivery under her armpit, clamped there by extremely well defined muscles in that area, as she clutches her prize possession between two hands. There is more shuffling as her destination is the kitchen table.   A soft growl is heard as she bypasses the sleeping furball, who lifts his head at the sound, wondering yet again why his Mistress insists upon making this sound. Furballs are just not interested in coffee. The fuzzy head merely flops back to the floor with a sigh and a body rollover.   Coffee mug, filled with steaming goodness, is placed on the table, near at hand. The morning delivery is set beside it and the Shroom plops unladylike into an empty chair. This Shroom is not feeling anything resembling ladylike at the moment.   The newspaper is flipped opened and shuffled through, keeper... keeper... compost pile fodder.. an unsteady hand reaches for the mug, lifting it to her lips and the rich creamy darkness is sucked down as quickly as its heat will allow. Oh, the glory of it! The peace, the quiet...the only sound is the rustle of a turning page and the sucking noise of mana from a warm mug.   Then it happens. Without warning, without forethought, the sound of NASCAR racing BLARES throughout the tiny hovel via modern technology called, Surround Sound. Newsprint flies everywhere. The nectar of the Gods spill and the Shroom must now be scraped from the ceiling.

      Well, at the moment "The Zoo" is quiet. No one here but the resident zookeepers. Wanna bet it doesn't stay this peaceful? It's a sucker bet, don't take me up on it.   I've been up since nine, but didn't get to the computer with my first cup of coffee until about 11 or so. Found out that my writing partner was online and had furthered the storyline a bit, especially after he read what was done last night after he left. I jumped online to chat with him a bit. It never fails to amaze me how we dovetail so well when it comes to stories. Writing with him is such a pleasure. He left to go have lunch leaving me with a quarter cup of coffee and a spinning head. Damn, I just need to get all this stuff brewing in my gray matter onto electronic paper. THIS is always what happens, I have this need to write but then in the next second, a very close second, there are things here on the homefront that need attending to. I put the home stuff first and by the time I get back to the keyboard, my desire to write has gone *poof* dammit. I got to figure a way around that. There's always so much to be done around the homestead. I never get caught up where I can just do maintenance. There's also the other matter of a different type of genre writing I want to get to. I also need to do some creative graphic manipulation to go with it. ARUGH.   So, my decision? The hubby is currently watching something on TV. I shall take my second cup of coffee, hit the shower, stand under it until my mind quits twitching, get dressed see where we are in hubby's motivational state and take it from there. Somewhere, sometime today I shall get to the storyline update even if I have to stay offline to do so....maybe even entice the hubs into a Mexican lunch.. gee, I'm craving Mexican. I wonder why. *eye roll*   My whine: Too many things to do, not enough time and I ain't killing myself to get it all done either.

      The day has been fairly uneventful. I did get in some quality roleplay with a good friend who is a damn fine writer and roleplayer if you ask me. My writing partner, bless his heart, is still pulling early morning hours. I miss him, when he's ready, he'll be back into the action.   I find it a challenge to play my character to a wide range of emotions. She may be strong, knows her heart but she still has to have vulnerability. I have to stop and think before I act, even if it means I must have her react in a way I rather not. I am constantly asking the question, how would a woman deeply in love with her husband react to the situation at hand? She can rise above some emotions but she is not some super human being that conquers everything. Most of the time, my character flows from my fingertips. There are times however, that, I truly have to stop and think. There is much in her history that is not explained yet. I'm working on it... slowly.  I'm grinnng. The hubby just came home from his VFW meeting. They had a potluck and I made a dessert for him to take, 'Better Than Sex Cake'. When he told one of the ladies what he was bringing tonight she said, " What could be better than sex? " When he told me that, I grinned and replied, " Tell her chocolate, of course. " When he got home and showed me the empty pan, I laughed. I knew there would be nothing left. I asked him if the lady got a piece and he told me she did and gave her a couple of extra pieces to take home with her since her husband loved it. Nice to know they liked it so much. It's a big hit with the family too and easy to make, but I don't make it too often. Heaven forbid I should spoil them. ~grin~

      Actually, I've been up since about 6 am or so. A small sheltie who shall remain nameless ~ahem~ decided she needed to 'herd' a cat or two outside my bedroom window. When that wasn't good enough she crawled under the office to give chase and then couldn't get out again.   The phones are silent on this Thursday (shhhh..knock wood on that one) so I am going to try to take this opportunity to write and catch my character up in the current BlackHawke storyline.  Someone come clean house for me, please?

      I wouldn't exactly call it insomnia. I was tired and sleepy at a pretty decent hour. I went to bed, fell promptly asleep and now find myself awake in the early morning hours. I do this a lot and I usually don't get back to sleep until a couple of hours later. It's a dang good thing the hubby or I don't work for anyone else. I usually watch tv until I fall asleep again but that's half my problem I think. I get so into what's on, I don't go to sleep. This pattern has to change. So, here I am sitting at my desk, writing this while my cup of herbal tea cools enough to drink. It's a tea that promotes sleep and works rather well on me, when I remember to use it. Another trick of mine is to get up and do something, trick the brain into believing I'm active until it says time to go to bed, you moron. The hubby is a good soul, hard of hearing he may be, but the tv in the bedroom still keeps him awake. He's learned to sleep through it, but his sleep is broken up too and I'm sure he is not all that rested.   Think what you will, but something is going on in cosmos. I'm restless. Internally. I'm not exactly satisfied with everything. It feels like...same story, different day... and trust me on this, I don't think like that. I've felt like this before, so I know it will pass in time. I also know that it has nothing to do with not being happy with my life. Sometimes, it bothers the hell out of me to feel like some sort of cosmic conduit. Sometimes....it feels like.... waves of dissatisfaction, discontent, restlessness go in one side of me and comes out the other side more balanced and peaceful. I did not eat ANYthing weird before I went to bed and there's nothing in my tea, so don't go there.   Ahhh, the tea is kicking in or the brain is talking to the moron. Either way, sleep seems to be calling. Now, if I can only make it down to the hall and by the time I ease this old bod onto the bed again, fall alseep and stay that way until the heat of the morning drives me from the bedroom, I'll be doing good.   Good Night, Mr. Bear, wherever you are....

      Let's see... the kids got their new apartment, they move July 1st. Apparently they will have to downsize as the the new apartment is smaller then the one they're in now but each kid has their own rooms and those are pretty decent size. Daughter and I will be going through the apartment and figuring ways to be more organized and how to utilize space. The only problem I see with that is daughter only half listens to me and half carries it out. The best news of all is that Pookie doesn't have to change schools yet again. Huzzah.  We had to change our cruise date to October. The business is slowly starting up which usually means we work later and I can't justify leaving invoices and payments for 16 days. By Oct. We should be slowed down enough to cruise Hawaii.   The vendor from hell is appeased for the moment. We received payment by one of our slothy clients and this payment brings them up to date. Thank you Lady! The other client jumped ship as a sub-contractor so we filed a demand for payment from their bonding company. The bonding company sent back paperwork to file out and they will be in touch once they try to contact the client, good luck. We've been trying to contact the slothy client for a few months now, no response. Now if the Lady's Grace will stay with us long enough to collect from the bonding company, I may just avoid an ulcer yet. ~snort~ Like I see that written in the stars. I just want a smooth season, able to completely pay her off and then be able to say, " See ya. Thanks for the memories. " Okay, maybe not the memories. I could do well without them.   It hurts me to see any of my children hurting. My youngest got into an argument with one of his closet friends yesterday. #3 son came to see me in the office last night and we had a bit of heart to heart. Bottom line is they'll get over this, like all the other times. It just might take awhile. Both of them said things that were a bit on the angry and hurtful side. There is nothing I can do to make the hurt go away or fix the problem. It must have been pretty bad, he had tears in his eyes and that doesn't happen often. I think after our talk, he was feeling a bit better. At the very least, I hope he got a different perspective on it. I think half the problem is that his friend has no sense of direction. He can't hold down a job, he can't seem to finish school. He is wandering aimlessly out there. #3 son on the other hand, is a construction apprentice, works five days week and is contemplating going to college part time. The tables have turned and I think it unsettles his friend. He's a good kid, they both are. I have every faith they will make up down the road in a few weeks.   I find myself doing more and more editorial work in the business. The hubby is making costly mistakes and it isn't like you can go back and tell your clients, " Oops, sorry made a mistake here. Here's what you really owe. " They get kinda testy about that. Much of it is the hubby's medical problems. A lot of things are getting worse as he ages, but I knew that would happen and I accept my role in things. I just get a little more stressful is all. I love him and that comes with for better or worse. I just do what needs to be done.  My writing partner has me ever so curious as to how he'll work himself back into the action. I hate not knowing how things are going to go. I hate waiting for them to happen and yes, dammit, I love it.   The next sound heard is my forehead banging on my desktop.

      I am running on one cup of coffee currently and as those who know me best know, I am not even remotely functional as a society defined human being until after the second cup is consumed, but let's see if I can fake coherency.  There are two things I try desperately never to do with people I know, discuss politics or religion. I respect these people. I respect their right to their opinions and views. I do not want to get into a debate with them over such things. I am not out to change their outlook nor am I out to defend mine. Maybe that's a cop out, you know but I don't care. I've seen and felt what such discussions can cause. There are moments of discomfort, of awkwardness, of frustration. They never last, not with people who truly have meaning in you life, but still. Maybe these moments deepen a relationship, maybe they don't. One thing I am certain of is that they do make an impact. During such conversations between those I know, with myself present, I will remain uninvolved.  I will make this small squeak.  I highly dislike this time of year, election year. I dislike watching or listening to the conventions. Mr. Mushy will turn them on and I will walk out of the room. If we're in the bedroom, I make him turn the channel. He listens for the parties' platforms. He wants to be well informed. I applaud him for that. I just won't suffer through it.  I just want to know one thing. Why does it become a necessity to hold someone or ourselves up for comparison to make a point? Why is it necessary to make this comparison in order to help solidify that one person is better than the other. It's childish.  Look at me, my ball is brighter and better. Mommy! Tommy did this and Tommy didn't do that. Brandon promised!  I am sick of it. Say what you believe in, say what you hope to accomplish and stand true to the person you are.  Maybe that's only possible in Xanadu.

      WHAT WAS I THINKING???!!!  1) I'm a good mother. 2) Things needed done and no one else was going to do it. 3) I can do this. 4) I have some things that need seeing to. This should not be too bad. 5) I had a lapse of sanity.  I HATE shopping. I do. If I feel the need to go shopping it must be because I want to kill something and since society frowns on that sort of thing and I really do like using a toilet in private, I choose the next worse scenario, I shop. I am eternally grateful that this feeling only comes over me once in a great while.  I tried not to think about it, shopping, daughter, two kids, many places to go and things to buy. The day started out at 9 am. I had to take Mr. Mushy over to the Veterans' Hall. The Honor Guard is presenting the colors at tomorrow's dedication of " The Field of Dreams " a ballpark this town has been wanting for ages. Yes, I know, not all that original, eh? What do you expect from a small country town anyways? Anywho, the guys had to meet with the ones pulling that pony show and go out to the field for practice, etc, etc. No big deal. We are fluid and accepting. Here in the Grove, plans change all the time. Next I had to go round up my small pack of darlings, daughter and two kids. Daughter moves slower than molasses and at this point there is a debate in The Grove whether a snail or molasses is slower. In either case, neither of them hold a plug nickel to my daughter. When I finally get her out the door and the babies loaded we set off for town.  Seven hours. Yep, you heard right, I spent seven hours shopping. At some point I had to make a stop at a local store that caters to bed and bath stuff and buy a replacement coffee carafe. Mine slipped out of my hands earlier this morning and shattered on the kitchen floor as I was making morning coffee. As I straightened up from my stooped position of retrieving the replacement, I turned and what should my glazed, tired eyes spy? A BLENDER! I could have sworn that the trumpets I heard sound off in my head were as glorious as some would reconcile as blown on Judgment Day. Now why should this produce such a reaction? Troll has previously blown up every damn blender that comes into this house. I swear. Everytime he went to make something in it, he blew it up. The last one actually oozed smoke. I had vowed to NEVER, EVER buy another one. But this... I had to have it. I needed it. I wanted it... and dammit, I bought it! Can we say Hallelujah? I know we can..... HALLELUJAH!! A cold, 'girlie' drink when I get home, I thought.  If you get home, some small demon whispered through my mind in an evil twisted sort of snicker.  Banish that thought! I cast ye forth and never to return, evil demon. I gloriously, triumphantly paid for my coffee pot replacement and my new blender. I stepped out of that store almost a new woman, I tell you. There was once more a hopeful, small spring in my step. I gloried in the fact that the end was soon near and that I could look forward to an intimate evening with my blender.  One hour and a half, three stores later, I had returned to the place I had first set out. The children were ensconced in front of the tv with their gameboys. The daughter's purchases lined her kitchen floor and after a sound thank you ringing in my ears, I was FINALLY away. One last stop. I needed to retrieve Mr. Mushy from the Veterans' Hall. He had all but melted by this time and wanted to go home. I must have gotten to the other side of town in record time. I can't be sure, I didn't check the speedometer. I scooped up Mr. Mushy and told the truck, " Home!" It went.  When we arrived home, Mr. Mushy went in to get Sprout to help remove the day's purchases. There really wasn't all that much. Sprout came out and chided me.  " Why didn't you tell me you were going? " " Uh, because you were asleep. " " You could have woken me up. I always tell you when I'm going out. " " You wouldn't have remembered it anyway. " " So? "  He might have gotten the last word but he also got the last smack on the back of the head. I got lucky with that one. Sprout is getting faster or maybe I'm just getting slower.  My most prized purchase of the day is still a virgin, sitting in its box, waiting. I am too exhausted to pull it forth, set it up and fill it up.  They do shoot horses, don't they? Can I be next?

      Lady save me from twenty year olds! Sprout works 5 days a week, about 8 hours a day, give or take as the Boss decides. Working private construction is a bit more flexible than working for a larger company. He leaves early in the mornings and gets back around 4 or so. Usually he goes off to shower, grabs something to eat and hides in his room to relax and play online. Weekends he usually gets out of the house when I don't have something that urgently needs to be done and I need his help with. Well, his boss is taking a week off, vacation time. This means Sprout is getting his vacation time too. Understandably he wants to go somewhere, to visit his father in Reno, Nv or his brother in Quincy, Calif. whatever it might be. I don't know if he called his father. That usually is a lost cause. I know he called his brother who can't make it down to pick Sprout up. Sprout has his own car but it's an 88 Honda, seemingly in good shape with over 100,000 miles on her. Sprout wanted to drive his car to his brother's. That's about a 3 hour drive one way. I vetoed that. First off the roads are steep, hilly and twisty. Sprout doesn't have a whole lot of drive time under him. He's a good driver. What worries me is that car of his. We don't know what the previous owner did with it. It's old and those hills will take it's toll on that car. His cell phone will black out and in the middle of nowhere and I mean nowhere, how will he get help if he breaks down? It could be hours before anyone showed up. The road to Sprout's brother's is that remote, beautiful but remote. If he had a car like Troll's I would worry of course, but not nearly so badly. It just wasn't, isn't, a good idea. He's disappointed, I understand that. I understand his frustrations. That may be the only reason I didn't rip his tongue out of his head when he was yelling that I wanted to keep him home all the time and why couldn't he take HIS car.     Okay, I have a rule, a hard and fast one. I do not go 'round and 'round with my kids over something I said no to or something I don't agree with. I hear them out. I let them make their case and if I still feel rather strongly about it, it's over, that's all she wrote. The matter is closed. I am not going in circles with them so they can get their way. They didn't make their case the first time around. My mind is not changing if they revisit the issue. Nuh-uh, not happening. Did I mention I have the car covered for insurance? He can go. I can't take him and he just needs to find some other way of getting there that is safe and sane.     Now unbeknownst to me, Sprout had called his brother. I find out my oldest son thought that Sprout could drive if he took the 'easier' route. I mentioned the easier route above. I told oldest son, I did not need this. I can't take any more stress. I haven't detoxed from FB of last week. I haven't been able to getaway somewhere and just de-stress and regenerate. I need it. Badly. I am in near tears overflow as it is. It isn't going to take much to set me off. I don't know what oldest son told his little brother, but Sprout has been quiet. It's not altogether a peaceful quiet, but at this point in time, I'll take anything I can get.     Sprout knows better than to bring this issue up again. I pray he does, because if he is foolish I'll have to squish him and bury him next to FB's place of honor. He'd like that. Yeah, right.

      Perhaps, at least until the next time. I am under no illusion that there will not be next time. There always is. He did seem to be a little subdued before he left. His attitude upon his return is something yet to be seen. Let me relate to you all that happened.     We picked FB up at the apartment and met his father at the towing yard with about 10 minutes to spare before the yard closed. Hubby went inside with them because FB needed a licensed driver. I proceeded to hop into the driver's seat with every intent of meeting them back at the apartment. Did it go down that way? Pluuuuease. That would have been too easy. Hubby came out holding up a hand to stop me. I lower the window to find out that they can't get the car released. Why? SOMEbody had to go to the police station and get a red stamp on the release papers. Oh yes and pay the $130.00 recovery fee, then bring it back to the towing yard along with the registration tags and red stamped paper and they can get the car. Now FB doesn't have that kind of money. He stands around outside our truck, hoping we're going to offer to pay that since his daddy just paid out $155.00 for the impound. Hubby looks at FB and tells him he better speak with his dad and proceeds to roll up his window so we could talk. FB does an about face and does just that. Daddy dearest is not happy but is going to give FB the money. Since the towing yard closed in 10 minutes, they told us if we come back first thing in the morning, we won't charge the additional $25.00 for keeping the car. We ask if the car can be released to hubby since he is going to drive it. Nope. FB needs to be there to accept the car. Gee, FB is not happy. This means he isn't going to get down south as soon as he would like. But wait! Let's use   mother-in-law's (namely me) cellphone and call the tow yard to see if daughter can pick up the car since she is on the registration (have I mentioned that FB fought over putting her on it when they bought the car because she didn't drive. Why should her name be on it?). One phone call later and it's a go because daughter is on the registration. Now we have to take FB over to his dad's, pick up the cash and run all the way to the other side of town to the police station. They don't close until 6 pm. At least we can get the red stamp, right? Wrong. I park outside of the police dept. They go inside. Again, the needed the license driver present. However, there has to be a cop at the desk to process this. No cops, they're all on patrol. Next thing I see is Mr. Mushy having some sharp words with an exiting detective. Oh Lady Bless, that's all I need. You see, I know Mr. Mushy. There are times he just doesn't know when NOT to tweak someone's tail. I roll down the passenger window, lean over and point at him. The look in my eyes by this time, speaks more than mere volumes. Six pm rolls around and out they come, did they get it? Nope. They have to go over to the local DMV, pay the college parking ticket fine of $30.00., get the tags, then go back to the police station get the stamp and THEN we can pick up the car. So, all that's left is to take FB home. Now FB is talking like daughter can do all this tomorrow, by herself, dragging two kids along. I told him I didn't think so. Daughter and I had already had that conversation while they were inside the police station. There was no telling how long the wait was going to be in each place on the morrow and I sure as hell wasn't dragging those babies out in this heat. No, FB was going to have to handle this himself. We offered to cart him around.     I get a phone call later from FB. My "adopted" daughter Tiffany is going to take him to the bus station so I don't have go. Tiffany is one of those kids that got adopted by merely being a friend of the kids when they were all in high school. Ironically, I went to high school with her dad. Tiffy as we fondly call her, also offered to babysit the kids while we ran daughter around to get all this stuff done. Daughter let FB off the hook. So, early in the morning (wednesday) we headed straight for DMV and she was in and out in five minutes. Done. Next stop, Police Dept. They were in there all of 15 minutes, maybe. Done. Final stop, towing yard. That was completed in 5 maybe ten minutes. See what good karma will do for you? Trust me, when FB called, she told him that too. I found out after the fact, that FB was grumbling that we just didn't want to take the kids around with us to run all these errands (we're out to get him, don't you know). I know he was complaining because he thought he wasn't going to get to go down south. Lady forbid that he had to stay behind and actually clean up after his own mess. He surely didn't get the point of why I didn't want to haul those babies around in this heat. Self absorption. Remind me to stuff his Yule stocking with sponges this year. Well he's damn lucky his wife let him off the hook. Come to think of it, he sure was using his sucking up talent real well before he left. He was talking about a bus pass when he gets back. Yeah, he better mean it. He gets caught driving again and the cop made sure he understood, next time will be jail time and daughter can't bail him out and we aren't. Did we even get a thank you out of all this? Nary a word. Par for course.     Daughter has no less than 5 medical appointments next month that I or someone will have to drive her to. Are we going to make his life easier? *snort*.

      This one doesn't even rate grabbing a shovel. I swear, at the moment all I can do is sigh and shake my head.      Daughter just called, oh about, 19 minutes ago. " Is Dad home? Is he busy? Does someone have a vehicle available?" Now there's a clue if ever there was one.     FB decides he is going to go uptown to buy his bus ticket now so he doesn't have to worry about it at 2 am. Two blocks from the bus station, guess who gets pulled over by the local PD? Oh, you betcha by golly. What does he get pulled over for? He doesn't have his front license plate on the car. It fell off during or after the accident (that was his other ticket) Cop runs a make on the car. The registration(the one we paid for) is not complete. Why? Apparently FB got a parking ticket at the local junior college he is attending and never paid it. Did he not think it would get put into the data base or what? Next comes the check on FB's license. We all know what comes next, right? Say bye-bye car. Can we say, impound? I knew we could.     Hubby goes to get FB, who at least had the sense to pull the car seat out for the grandson. FB is at the bus station. FB is on phone with wife aka daughter. Wife advises FB he is not going anywhere until this matter is taken care of. FB has had the car impounded before. Hubby now has to run daughter over to the post office to pick up a package, bring her home and is now currently sitting in the local Veteran's Hall having a cold drink. I'm proud of him, he kept his cool, bit his tongue. He's earned that drink.     Here's how the situation is going to play out. FB had to call his father for the money to bail out the car. The money was not coming from anyone in this family. So, at about 4-4:30 pm PDT hubby and I will go pick up FB, meet FB's father (oh goodie) at the towing yard. FB's father will pay bill. Wait.. ready for this? FB wanted to drive his car home. Cheeeeeeeeuz. Does nothing sink into that boy's head? He was informed by his wife that no, he will not be driving that car. Hubby will drive it back to their house and park it. I will follow and pick up the hubby. Hubby looks at FB and tells him. " This is not your day. You don't need to be driving again. " When I spoke to hubby on the cell phone, hubby says to me, " That boy's karma is all messed up. " Gee, ya think? If I thought smacking FB up the side of the head with my shovel would knock some damn sense into him, I'd volunteer and gladly. I know it would be a futile exercise however. I will save my energy for something more important.     Oh yes... and FB wanted to know, with everything that has happened today, if I was still going to take him to the bus station?      Now, dear reader and friends... tell me, what do you think?

      Yesterday my daughter called and asked if she and the family could come over and hang out a bit since they were out this way before one of her medical appointments. It was hot out and I said fine. She wanted to check because she had FB with her. In other words she wanted to see just how ticked off at him I still was. I told her my initial irritation over this latest crap was over, which translates into I'm still irritated as hell with him but I don't feel like grabbing the shovel and burying him in with the rose bushes right this moment. They didn't stay long, long enough to get a bit cooled down, long enough for Pookie to play with the babies (who btw, have all opened their eyes and are starting to play around a bit. Maybe I'll get my drawer back soon), long enough for FB to feel comfortable enough to grab some oreos and a drink. *snort*. Plans are still on for me to dump him at the bus station Wednesday morning at 2 am. His brother will be picking him up after an eight hour bus ride and then off they go to Az for about a week and a half.     My writing focus has switched gears for the moment. I am hoping that such a switch will help bring my creative writing for Camelot back around. I buried myself so long into my love of medieval that I have ignored all the other genre of writing I like to indulge. Camelot is not to be forgotten nor ignored. I will continue to plod along as best I can with it, hoping something will begin to flow again. It seems I am not the only one. It appears like my writing partner also is having a rough time. Since a good deal of my inspiration comes from him, well there you go. Maybe it's been a case of "too much of a good thing"? I don't know. As I told my partner, it's a cycle and if we just tough it out, it will all come around. Then again, sometimes I just feel...lost and I can't find the damn compass. You'll find the link to the beginning offerings of one of those other forms of genre to the right of my blogs.     I'm not sure why I picked the name 'Erotic Moon'. I think because there is this seductiveness to the darker edge of creativity. It rolls around on my tongue like a damn good dark chocolate, sinful, sweet, forbidden, erotic. It's not an area I dwell in for too long, but it's needful. Like the moon, I have phases and I think to fully be me, I need to indulge in them from time to time.     Some part of me feels like I am running on empty again. I get this way from time to time. Someone comes along and refills me and I'm good enough to go all over. I am tired, exhausted in fact, mentally, not physically. I'm on empty emotional wise. For those of you that know me better than most, that know how it is with my personal life and more specifically my hubby, perhaps can understand what I am trying to say here. There are no complaints from me. I knew what I was getting into or had a fairly good idea of such when I started off down this path. It's hard on me from time to time and what sustains me in the long run is love. I'm as human as anyone else out there. From time to time I miss the part of me I gave up. From time to time I am just...empty and empty is not such a bad thing really. Sometimes we have to empty the container, clean it out, so that what pours back in is sparkling, clean and fortified.

      I woke about around 4 am this morning, as I often do these days and I am only now beginning to shake the feeling that came over me. It's not as heart wrenching as the one I had a few days before the 9/11 attack but I can't help but think something painful is going to happen. I can't even place whether it is something that is going to happen to me or mine or within the circle of people that have a part in my everyday life or if it something that is going to befall the world again. I just know it's the same feeling that came over me before. The part I hate the most is the not knowing. It's like watching a swinging axe over my head sway back and forth and I'm helpless to stop it. Indeed, I know it is something I can't stop. What is to come, if it is time to be, will be. Some things we can change, the feeling that rides hard with this one is that, there is no choice here. It is inevitable. Some things are. Of all the gifts I am blessed with, of all the gifts I am thankful for, this one is not. Why? Because from my standpoint, it is useless. What is its point if I can't use it for something constructive? To just be some sort of....monitor just seems.... so wrong.     There are so few sureties in my life. Things I just know will happen. I can't pin them down to a time frame, merely that they will come to be. I knew that Saddam would be captured. I know Osama will also pass from what power he wields. Perhaps to some, that isn't saying much. Those are things that are predictable. Perhaps. Things could have and still have the ability to go other ways. They just may. All I know for sure, deep in my gut, is that it will come to pass and it won't be years from now.     The greatest surety in my life and the one that sustains me, is that I am loved. I have accomplished something with my life, modest as it may be in the greater scheme of things. People spend hours, even years trying to figure out why they came into this world and what their purpose is. I know mine. It is to make a difference, no matter how minute that may seem in my eyes given my perception of the Great Design. Everything matters, everything causes a ripple. Right or wrong, each decision, each action, has consequences and or dividends. Something must be paid back and something pays forward. Each person comes into this world with something to give and something to learn.     I came into this world to love and be loved, to make a difference. I am.  I do.

      It's Friday. I know that means something to people who actually go out and work in the world. For me it marks another week completed and to take an evaluation to see how much of my sanity (what's left of it) has been retained, not to mention taking stock of my patience level as well. It's only 1pm pdt but for now my assessment is that I am beat. It is all I can do to merely wrap up what needs to be done for this week.     Daughter and FB: Today is FB's birthday. Dare I hope FB's head may have slipped just even a millisecond out of its current resting place? In some cultures the birthday person actually gives gifts away. I would be happy for this to be mine. He is a bit more subdued. He is grumbling a bit but at least holding the attitude in check. After all, he will be taking a bus down to meet his brother so they can go visit their oldest brother in Az. He needs to take the 2am bus out of town Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. Not a problem. I am still awake at that hour, I'd be more than happy to put his arse on the bus. *insert a VERY cheesy grin here*. I was going to give Daughter about $40.00 to take FB out to dinner. I do it for the kids and spouses. However, they had to borrow $70.00 yesterday to register their car. Daughter has been very good about not borrowing money and I have been very good about keeping our purse strings closed. This needed to be done or penalties of $2.00 a day would keep racking up and I know money is super tight for them given their recent move. Besides, my daughter works off the money by doing some office work for me.    FB's brother is not happy that his plans are not going his way, but he seems to be falling in with them. FB's father even agreed that my daughter had a good idea about giving FB bus fare instead of gas money. He said he was even going to suggest that himself. Well damn, my daughter actually has a good idea once in awhile. * eye roll* It use to bother her that his folks don't like her, but over the past years she has come to the conclusion that she can't do anything right where they are concerned and she will never be good enough for their son. She is past caring. However, since FB's mom is slowly dying because of Wilson's disease, my daughter does go over there to help out when there is a need. All she asks is that the responsibilities and needs of their (FB's and hers) family get met. She also refuses to allow her father-in-law to simply use them when he feels inconvenienced by his wife's illness or requirements. That in and of itself was battle and has left ill will between his parents in regards to her. To them, that's what family is for, to do whatever needs to be done. FB owes it to them. ARUGH! Now I have instilled into my daughter a sense of family, that yes, your elders deserve respect and help when it is needed but that also must be tempered by the needs of your own immediate family. Those responsibilities must come first unless the situation is so dire that seeing to your parents is paramount. There are things around here we could use help with but they are not so important to surmount the needs of her immediate family. It's all about priorities.     Business: I am ready to choke the living daylights out of the company from hell, the same one that belongs to the wench from hell. it has taken them 3 months to get us the bills of laden to prove the materials were delivered as promised. The hubby was working on the claims form to submit to the bonding company and found out that the bills of laden they sent over were for invoices that were ALREADY paid for. I am grinding my teeth as I write. He called them back and advised them of the situation and told them what bills of laden he needed. It makes me wonder how in sam hell they keep their files. We'll see how long it takes them to get these to us. I don't know what the statue of limitations is to file with the bonding company, but if it doesn't happen, the wench from hell has no one to blame but herself for it. I am keeping running notes of conversations between us over it.     On another note, we thought our status as suppliers was all set. Come to find out on Monday, the gentleman who told us we were set would be out all week and the other person who needed the verifying info couldn't get the verification of what we told her and of course, they haven't had a department meeting yet to share their findings. That meant we needed to reverify for this new bid that came across. No problem, I just changed the former letter sent to comply with this new project AND Mr Mushy sent down, via overnight FEDEX, a copy of schedule C from our tax return showing our inventory for 2003. We were advised that would make life easier. Let us hope so.     Today: Things are quiet. Let me not say that, even mentally, too loudly. It would be tempting the Universe which seems to be taking perverse pleasure in being a pain in the arse. The temps around here are up in the 104-105 degrees F and make me move about slower. By the time the afternoon gets here, I am wilting, mentally and physically. I am hoping that in the next day or two I can actually make time for some fun and relaxation. This would include roleplaying online and maybe some writing time. There is also the continuing renovating of the kitchen and some housework that needs attending.     For now, I am reveling in the simple peace that is currently surrounding me.

      Well the conclusion of this test hasn't changed over the years. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad that my personality has remained steadfast.    My results:       Your Type is            INFJ                  Introverted      Intutive      Feeling      Judging            Strength of the preferences %         44      33      22      22            The Counselor  urlLink  Idealists are abstract thought and speech, cooperative in reaching their goals, and directive and introverted in their interpersonal roles. Counselors focus on human potentials, think in terms of ethical values, and come easily to decisions. The small number of this type (little more than 2 percent) is regrettable, since Counselors have an unusually strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others and genuinely enjoy helping their companions. Although Counsleors tend to be private, sensitive people, and are not generally visible leaders, they nevertheless work quite intensely with those close to them, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes with their families, friends, and colleagues. This type has great depth of personality; they are themselves complicated, and can understand and deal with complex issues and people.    Counselors can be hard to get to know. They have an unusually rich inner life, but they are reserved and tend not to share their reactions except with those they trust. With their loved ones, certainly, Counselors are not reluctant to express their feelings, their face lighting up with the positive emotions, but darkening like a thunderhead with the negative. Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact. At the same time, friends who have known an Counselor for years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that they are inconsistent; Counselors value their integrity a great deal, but they have intricately woven, mysterious personalities which sometimes puzzle even them.    Counselors have strong empathic abilities and can become aware of another's emotions or intentions -- good or evil -- even before that person is conscious of them. This "mind-reading" can take the form of feeling the hidden distress or illnesses of others to an extent which is difficult for other types to comprehend. Even Counselors can seldom tell how they came to penetrate others' feelings so keenly. Furthermore, the Counselor is most likely of all the types to demonstrate an ability to understand psychic phenomena and to have visions of human events, past, present, or future. What is known as ESP may well be exceptional intuitive ability-in both its forms, projection and introjection. Such supernormal intuition is found frequently in the Counselor, and can extend to people, things, and often events, taking the form of visions, episodes of foreknowledge, premonitions, auditory and visual images of things to come, as well as uncanny communications with certain individuals at a distance.     You can take the urlLink  test  yourself.

      You know, I like the hovel. It's so peaceful and quiet around here most times. Yes, there are times when the phone rings at least 20 times and thanks to caller-id, I can pick and choose. I use this feature a lot. It's dark and calm in the grove and I like being a see-nothing, know-nothing mushroom. I'm getting to be an old 'shroom. I just want to sit here and rock in my chair, count my wrinkles and not deal with youthful drama.     So, noting that the situation can be as fluid as mercury, subject to change at a moment's notice, this is latest. FB couldn't get his ex-tutor to cover next week's appointment, but he had a plan. FB's brother has plans with his uncle for Monday and Tuesday so waiting to go south and then to Az after Tuesday was a no deal. What FB did come up with was this: He would stay behind, take daughter to appointment on Tuesday and then drive down to meet his brother. They would pick up brother's newly purchased vehicle and drive to Az. and be back on the 5th. They would drive back to the cousin's house and pick up their mom's jeep and FB's car and come back north.     There's only one little snag I can see with this plan. FB doesn't have a valid license to drive. It's been suspended due to his impatience which resulted in a minor car accident and his two speeding tickets, all of which was achieved either in the same month or the next. Also their car is a tin can waiting to fall apart. So, daughter and I came to the same conclusion to run past these two. If brother is willing to pay for FB's gas, roundtrip, why not just get FB a one way bus ticket down south and have family down there pick him up. It would save FB's brother some money. Then the guys can go from down south to Az. This also keeps FB from driving the heap of a car. Now daughter has warned FB, you are driving on a suspended license and if you get pulled over for speeding, the CHP are going to run a make on your license and they're more than likely gonna lock his arse up and impound the car. If the car breaks down, he's foo-barred. His brother is going to have to bail his arse out and then they are going to have to decide what to do about the car. The kids don't have the money and this family, none of us, are going to get him out of the jam, should he get into one. His response has been that since daughter doesn't want him driving the car down there then maybe he shouldn't be driving at all around town either, which is blatantly saying to her that he shouldn't be running her around town when the need arises. Daughter points out that one, FB is going to drive, period. There is no way he is going to take the bus and two, at least if the car breaks down in town someone is around, close by to make sure he gets home and the car gets towed should it break down. No come back for that one. Needless to say, FB is going to speak with his brother and see what brother says.     Oh yes, and FB wanted to know just how he was going to get to the bus station here in town. I advised that either Mr. Mushy or myself would be more than willing to put him on a bus going out of town. It certainly would be a pleasure to do so.

      I had it! Incoming LONG Rant. Save yourselves now and go elsewhere.     1) My daughter has a few health issues. Currently, she is having tests done so the health professionals can pinpoint the problem.   2) FB's brother is home on leave(30 days), courtesy of the U.S. Army. His unit has finally left Iraq.       FB's brother wants to buy his cousin's car and then go visit the oldest sibling and family in Az. FB and daughter talked about FB being able to do this. Well and fine. It was a week's worth of vacation time for FB. The problem is, daughter has appointments next week she can't miss. Daughter does not drive. Trust me, she has tried and she is an accident waiting to happen. She's just one of those people who can't do it, at least not now. There's a chance when she gets a little older she could do it. We'll see. In the meantime she has to depend on FB to take her everywhere. If FB can't do it (not won't do it), then we step in or a friend does. My daughter is very good about that. FB is having a cow because now he can't go with his brother. He has turned into a sullen little boy having a temper tantrum because we refuse to help out here. Family is suppose to help out. I have listened to this via my daughter for months and months now. She knows my position about this. I have held my tongue because I don't want him taking his damn temper out on her or that my babies become unsettled because daddy is having a hissy fit.     Today, the hubby and I went over there. FB didn't come home last night. Five will get you ten, he spent the night at his parents house. His brother is there, his parents are there and he will get the support he needs for his feelings and told how right he is and wrong we are or even how wrong my daughter is. Validation came on swift heels. When we got to their apartment, FB was home. She took a little longer to answer the door than I liked. Her eyes were also red from crying. I saw the writing on the wall and I knew they had gotten into it again. At first she stood in the partially opened doorway, door behind her when she answered. I wasn't having any of that. If FB was in there and hurt her, I was gonna shred him. We stood at the door for a few chatting and she leaned over to whisper that FB's brother couldn't understand why we wouldn't take her. So, I told her why, in a voice loud enough for FB to hear. Then hard on those heels was the thought, ' To hell with this. I've had it.' FB was going to hear this straight from me. I stepped up and inside and there he sat, in his chair looking like a sullen pouty little boy. I repeated myself in case he didn't hear me the first time. I flat out told him that we weren't going to do this because she was his responsibility. I wasn't going to do this for him so he could go off gallivanting with his brother. Family is there for support, not to fill in for him when his responsibilities interfered with what he wanted to do. If his mother was in the hospital and daughter needed to go somewhere, fine. We can handle that. But I would be damned if I was going to fill in just because he can't step up to the plate and handle his responsibilities. I didn't want to hear about how she won't drive, that is old news, a done deal so he needed to quit beating a dead horse, get over it and move on. He married her. She didn't ask to become sick but she is and there are no immediate cures for it(them). I am so sick and tired of having to come to the rescue because he won't step up and do what he needs to do. Maybe if he did, I wouldn't mind doing him a favor now and then. As it is, I 'clean up' after one of his tantrums because I am not going to let my daughter or my babies suffer because FB won't get his head out of his ass.     I flat out told them tonight they need to decide what the sam hell they are going to do. Either they are going to work this through or he just needs to leave. If he chooses to leave, she can't do anything about it. He made a choice and he will need to live with the consequences whatever they may be and there will be some. He is not going to run roughshod over my daughter to get custody of their son. He lost custody of his daughter by a previous marriage. He doesn't want that to happen with their son. He knows I will do whatever it takes to make sure she has damn good legal representation, if not the best this town has to offer. I am not out to see him get screwed over but I will not allow him to do it to her either. Don't get me wrong, she could have done far worse and he is basically a good person. He just needs to get his priorities straight and get his head out of his ass( did I mention that before?). I am so tired of hearing this, " When do I get time for me? " You don't. You got married, you had kids, what time? Time doesn't get to be your own until they all grow up and move out, even then your time isn't all yours, but you can damn sure control it better. They're both bad about this and trust me, I am on my daughter about things just as much. I am not blind where my children are concerned, any of them.     Needless to say, the whole time I was having my say to FB he spoke not a word. My daughter even told him, " Here she is. You tell her. You have a problem with her and her decisions, now is your chance to talk to her. She's right here. " Did he? No. Truthfully, I didn't think he would. He'll bully and bluster around my daughter, but he won't get into it with me, not after the first and only time he did it. Back then, when he was feeling froggy and almighty, he bit off more than he could chew and found me right back in his face. His father tried that with me. It didn't work for him either. I have a feeling that's why his parents don't care for me. They bluster real good until you come back at them. What have I always said? "You're a product of your environment. "     Of course FB's brother doesn't understand any of this. He's not married. He's younger than FB and by a few years and his last relationship was with a 16 year old high school girl he grew up with. Dynamics of a marriage are a whole lot different than just a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship. Apparently FB's brother told FB that if FB didn't come with him this time, brother wasn't ever going to ask FB to go anywhere ever again. In some small way, I feel sorry for FB. He's caught in the middle of this... family(sibling) and immediate family (wife and kids). He doesn't want to have to choose. To me, there isn't a choice to be made. His wife and kids come first, his responsibilities to them come first. He needs to grow some cajones and tell his brother that. FB just doesn't want to. Why? Because he really does want this trip away for a week, all expenses paid courtesy of little brother. Who wouldn't?     By the time we got home, settled in, the phone rang. It was daughter. FB had to go to college tonight. She told me she didn't know what I said sunk in with him, but FB was looking into who he could get to take care of this for him. If there was someone who could take her to her appointments and someone to watch the kids while daughter was being seen. He is thinking of his ex-tutor. They don't live too far away and the ex-tutor has a little girl about Pookie's age. Daughter isn't saying no, but she has some stipulations.She wants to meet the ex-tutor and the mother (who may be watching the my babies) and she wants them to meet the kids and visa versa. If the kids have a real problem with the ladies, it's a no go. FB tells daughter she's too overly protective. Daughter tells FB that's not so, she is cautious. She is not leaving her children in the hands of strangers. All it takes is one time and one time may be one time too many. So, we'll see.     Daughter is suppose to call me back later tonight after she talks with FB. My guess is FB is going to go spend the night at his parents' house again. I offered to take daughter to get milk for the babies and take her to get her disability paperwork tomorrow. FB, in his current mood, would grudgingly do it and make her and the babies miserable with his attitude or he would just not do it. I told daughter I expect him to handle it but I will do this if he won't. It's just one more thing he'll tick me off about. I'll do what needs to be done for the welfare of my daughter and her children. I know FB, his brother and his parents think I'm a bitch.     That's not A bitch but THE bitch and it's Ms. Bitch to them.

      Okay, now this is really starting to bug me. In the last four days, I've managed to evade two car accidents. On Friday afternoon, on the way home from Sacramento, I manage to avoid the car that wanted to eat Troll's bumper, the fire watchers, remember? Tonight I was on the return trip home from taking the grandson home and had just a few seconds reaction time to some punk kid with a lead foot on his gas pedal. He saw me too a few seconds later than he should have. Thank the Lady one of us was paying attention. So, I go by him, just motoring home ( in Troll's car again. Can you believe it?) and the punk is behind me, two other cars in front of me. Punk kid decides he just has to get in front of me so badly he crosses the solid do not pass yellow line, only to find himself having to pull up short why? Because there is oncoming traffic headed his way. He lays into his brakes hard. I had already seen the writing on the wall once I saw him pass me. I was already in slow gear. He slides in in front of me and about 5 yards in front of us he turns into one of those gas/convience stores. I swear he was not sane or logical. His foot was on the gas pedal when he made the turn. I just wanted the hell out of there since he was an accident waiting to happen. I was also saying a prayer of thanks that I had already delivered the grandson home to his folks. The Pookie is spending the night. I'm telling you, something is up in the Universe. I wonder if it has something to do with the dark moon we're experiencing.... GQS is in a funk... Lunacy has injured himself... and I'm avoiding accidents and trying like hell to decipher the undercurrents going on with the hubby. It's nothing I can lay a finger on exactly, but I can sense something there.     I just have two questions for the Universe......    Is anything ever going to make sense again? And, do I ever get to climb up this rope instead of hanging on by the knot on the end of it?    I probably should have asked about sanity somewhere in there too, but right at the moment, I'm not sure I know what that is.

      The morning light added to the gleam in 'shroom's eyes. Wearing a pair of safety goggles, armed in one hand with an electric screw driver and in the other with a palm sander, 'shroom bravely tackled the first of the kitchen cabinets. They would need to be all sanded before they can be repainted. Today would be the 2 cabinets next to the stove. There was much build up from over the past 30 years to get through. Shroom was not daunted. Armed with Mr. Mushy's power tools, she slid the safety glasses in place and got to work. It must go on the record that Mr. Mushy thinks highly of his power tools. However, before he disappeared for his afternoon appointment he did set 'shroom up with the sander and the electric screw driver. Troll had gone to work and Sprout was at the bank, cashing his last two pay checks. Muhahahahaha... alone! With power tools.     Now the shroom must admit to never having used power tools before. It is unclear if the reason was because she did not want to use them OR if Mr. Mushy just kept her away from his tools. Whatever the case, they were in her hands now. First, to remove the doors and their hardware. Easily enough done you'd think. However, shroom didn't count on one thing. She couldn't reach the screws in the hinges for the cabinet up above the counter, even on a two-step stepstool. Enter Sprout. Sprout generously handed over over a certain sum of money for continuous payment of past debts. Shroom thanked him and looked sufficiently ill-abled that Sprout took up the electric screwdriver and removed the cabinet doors that remained. Such a nice, loving lad. He even took the time to show 'shroom how to put sandpaper on the palm sander correctly.     At this time, 'shroom has gone through three full sheets of sandpaper and having placed an emergency call to to Mr. Mushy with a request for more sandpaper, she has managed to sand the cabinets and the doors. She is awaiting the return of Mr. Mushy so she can finish up the job before replacing the doors' hardware and replacing the doors. The plan is to sand all the cabinets and doors before starting on the next phase, painting.     Since they don't make cabinets such as these (without being terribly pricey), it was decided to recycle what can be recycled with a new paint job and new hardware. New cabinets will be obtained after the kitchen has been repaired and certain other aspects seen too first. Priorities.     'Shroom has come to the conclusion that she  LIKES  power tools. When they are in her hands, she has THE POWER. It's enough to make her dizzy or perhaps even faint.  Myyyyyy prrreciousssssss.    Power Tools... oh my.     The saga will continue.

      I know my memory's fading. I actually kept my mammogram appointment. I chose a seat next to a man and his wife in the waiting room. Both the chairs and conversations were so comfortable that before long I'd totally forgotten why I was there and asked the man. "So...what are you here for?" Talk about a showstopper. Dead silence just as "Nurse Ratchet" announced my name in her best baritone voice. I thought, "Great..a name to match the idiot." I rushed past the giggles and hurried after the angel of no mercy.   Rounding the corner, I was met with, "Hi! I'm Belinda!" This perky clipboard carrier smiled from ear to ear, tilted her head to one side and crooned, "Allll I need you to do is step into this room right hereee,strip to the waist, thennnn slip on this gown. Everything clearrrr?" I'm thinking, "Belinda...try decaf. This ain't rocket science." Belinda skipped away to prepare the chamber of horrors. Call me crazy, but I suspect a man invented this machine. It takes a perfectly healthy cup size of 36-B to a size 38-LONG in less than 60 seconds. Also, girls aren't made of sugar and spice and everything nice...it's Spandex. We can be stretched, pulled and twisted over a cold 4-inch piece of square glass and still pop back into shape.   With the right side finished, Belinda flipped me (literally) to the left and said, "Hmmmm. Can you stand on your tippy toes and lean in a tad so we can get everything?" Fine, I answered. I was freezing, bruised, and out of air, so why not use the remaining circulation in my legs and neck and finish me off? My body was in a holding pattern that defied gravity when we heard, then felt, zap! Complete darkness.  "What?" I yelled.  "Oh, maintenance is working. Bet they hit a snag."   Belinda headed for the door. "Excuse me! You're not leaving are you?" I shouted. Belinda kept going and said, "Oh, you fussy puppy....the door's wide open so you'll have the emergency hall lights. I'll be righttttt backkkk." Before I could shout "NO" she disappeared.   And that's exactly how Bubba and Earl, maintenance men extraordinaire, found me, half-naked and parts of me dangling from the Jaws of Life. After exchanging polite "Hi, how's it going" type greetings, Bubba (or possibly Earl) asked, to my utter disbelief, if I knew the power was off. Trying to disguise my hysteria, I replied with as much calmness as possible.  "Uh, yes...yes we did, thanks."  "You bet, take care," Bubba replied and waved good-bye as though we'd been standing in the line at the grocery store.   Two hours later, Belinda breezes in wearing a sheepish grin and making no attempt to suppress her amusement, she said. "Oh I am soooo sorry! The power came back on and I totally forgot about you! And silly me, I went to lunch. Are we upset?"   And that, Your Honour, is exactly how her head ended up between the clamps.....

      A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items  in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he  picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and  proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students  if the jar was full.   They agreed that it was.   So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the  jar was full.   They agreed it was.   The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the  jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once  more if the jar was full.   The students responded with an unanimous "yes."   The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the  table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling  the empty space between the sand.   The students laughed.   "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, " I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.   The golf balls are the important things-your God, family, your  children, your health, your friends, and your favorite passions.  Things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.   The pebbles are the other things that matter, like your job, your house, and your car.   The sand is everything else--the small stuff.   "If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no  room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you  spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have  room for the things that are important to you.   Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.   Play with your children.  Take time to get medical checkups.  Take your partner out to dinner.  Play another 18.   There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal.   Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter.   Set your priorities. The rest is just sand."   One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.   The professor smiled.   "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."

      It's five o'clock somewhere. I want a margarita.       Here we go:  Got up early and drove with the hubby to Sacramento for his appointment with Oncology. It's about a 2 1/2 hour drive one way. We get there about an hour and a half early because I find out Mr. Mushy thinks his appointment is an hour earlier than it is. I told him last night what time the appointment was and asked when he wanted to leave. Duh. That's okay though, it worked out. We had enough time to go have breakfast someplace together, something we don't get to do a lot. Got to his appointment on time, waited a half hour for a ten minute appointment. That's all it took. Doctor checked the labs, did a little poke, prod and listen. Mr. Mushy is fine. The doctor used the 'cured' word. I refuse to. I've had too much experience with cancer to do that. Cancer can slap you along the side of the head when you least expect it like a big old smelly fish. In three more years I'll let my guard down and in eight years, Lady willing, I'll finally believe it. Mr Mushy's liver is still doing some abnormal things, but his GP is watching it with the theory it's the meds. So, we don't have to make the trip to Sacramento again until Jan. 2005.     On the way home, I drove. *insert long string of cussing here* I'm watching the guy behind me who happens to be riding my bumper. Left lane is motoring along great. That's about to abruptly change. Everyone is putting on their brakes, myself included. The difference is, I have to steer off to the left side, onto the shoulder. Why? Because dorkness behind me, Mr. Bumper Man is headed for my bumper. I also don't want my front bumper to eat the back bumper of the guy in front of me. We're not driving " The Tank" (our truck) we borrowed Troll's little truck, car, suv, whatever it's classified as. Gas for Troll's vehicle down and back cost us only about $30.00. If we had taken "The Tank" it would have cost a little over $100.00 round trip. So you can see why I wanted to be very careful with Troll's car. He has insurance, but that's not the point. The point being that I would NEVER EVER hear the end of it. He loves me, but that's his baby. Back to the story, why did everyone slam on their brakes? Because everyone wanted to watch the CDF (Calif. Division of Forestry) put out a grass fire off to the right of the road. Come on people! This is California. We have fires all the time. It's not like this is something new. Let's try not to kill each other. What's a little grass burning with water covering it? Geez.     Sprout came home from work yesterday afternoon not good. What should have tipped me off was that he asked me for a glass of water while he headed straight for the bathroom. He said he was really thirsty. He works construction and has a good sized water jug. He went straight to bed, another thing not like him and it was only 5 pm. He got up when the phone rang. It was Sprout's boss checking up on him. Sprout came out late to eat and was in pain. Apparently he had this pain in his lower right groin region. My thought was his appendix. The poor lad was almost in tears. I offered to haul him down to the ER room last night. He wouldn't go. When I got up this morning I asked him how he felt. He said the pain was nearly gone, although before I left he was saying it was starting to hurt again. When I called later in the morning, Sprout had gone to work. I am still waiting on him to get home. There's been no word all day. Mama 'Shroom is a bit worried.     My thoughts are that since he ran out of water, he became dehydrated and cramped up, bad. He may have also gotten some heat exhaustion in there too. He was dang tired this morning despite all the sleep he got last night. Sleep is a great healer so that tells me something is not normal with Sprout. I don't think it's his appendix although I am watching that. As my daughter so graphically put it, Sprout was not ready to rip my eyes out of their sockets when I touched the sore area last night. Graphic isn't she? They all are. I'm not sure who they get that from, their father or myself. Although I was/am worried about Sprout, I could throttle the young man. I am trying to get some idea of what kind of pain. I am asking questions, same kind the doctor is going to ask (I pointed that out to Sprout too and his response was: I'll tell him the same thing). All Sprout is saying is, it hurts.  *eye roll*  okay, I got that. Is it a sharp pain like someone is jabbing needles into your flesh? Is it a dull throbbing pain? All I get is, " It hurts!" Well Duh.     Hopefully the kid will be home soon. I trust his boss. He's a neighbor as well and he knew Sprout wasn't up to par so he's going to keep his eye on the kid. Troll was home all day and there were no phone calls, so I am hoping all is well.      Lastly but not least:     CalTrans has given us the okay as a supplier. They investigated our process for supplying materials and our proof of being of commercial use. We got the green light. Of course, we had to trim some things from what we will be bidding on in the future. That's okay. So long as we remain in the game I am content. I'm not greedy. Money is nice, but slow and steady keeps me secure. This was the day before yesterday. Yesterday, we get another phone call from another CalTrans personage who verifies bids and she wanted the same info we had already provided before to someone else. So, the hubby came home today and called this personage and explained we had already been established as a legit supplier. She doesn't have the info. Apparently they are so overworked and haven't had the opportunity to have a depart. meeting to discuss all this and share info yet. What she required of us was due by the end of business today. With the phone call we now just need to check back with the other person who got the fax of info we sent over to make sure this other personage gets it. Confused? Welcome to our boat. Bottom line is she's going to check, we're going to follow up and everything should work out. From my mouth to the Lady's ear and may her Grace settle upon our shoulders. Monday.      Update-4:32pm:  Sprout just walked in the door. He feels fine and took a salt tablet today. He also had plenty of water. I think I can now crash and vegetate.

      My name is 'Shroom and I live in a compost pile. I likes it. Yesssss, I does. It's dark in here and if I don't open the bloody door, the drama doesn't come in. Gah! I'm too bloody old to keep dealing in drama. Back when I was so young I was a drama queen and I adored my reign. It was my time, but like all queens, at some point I had to retire. I kicked the crap into the closet, slammed the door. Every now and then I hear the commotion, but I just get out the nail gun and nail that damn door shut. Sometimes, I step out of the hovel, into The Grove and the damn stuff finds me. I usually go into my 'shroom stance. Oh come on now, you've all seen mushrooms growing, I know you have. That's THE STANCE and if I'm real quiet, drama darts by and I don't have to deal with it. 'Shrooms develop a tough skin as they get older.   Drama does not make me feel more alive, it wears me out. I find myself withdrawing every time I run into it or it runs into me. I acknowledge that youth needs drama. They can't help it. It's all part of that long haul. What I do have is the right not to have to bear witness to it. Do I hold it against anyone? No. I just have become more realistic and brutally truthful with myself about things and people. Sometimes, it makes me sound or seem callous. I don't mean it that way. I just don't cope well. Maybe I've become a cynic in my old age, but I look at drama and think to myself... what the hell was that in aid of and who does it serve? You can bet your bottom dollar I never thought of that when it was my turn as drama queen. No siree. But now it is my turn to wear the shoe on the other foot.. what goes around, comes around. I just hope I have a bit more patience with it. I never was a patient person.. it wasn't one of my virtues. I had it knocked into me by Life. Patience is not something you can teach. It's something you must learn.   Drama.. it's the other white meat... think I'll go look in the pantry and see what else there is.

      Maybe it's just dust bunnies, hm? Well, I'm certainly not getting rid of them. They keep me company.   Homefront: *knock wood* All is quiet for the moment. The new babies are starting to open their eyes and getting even more rolly-polly than ever. The shelties still don't know what to make of these tiny furballs, but Bubba (aka Cherokee) has taken to being their unofficial protector. He pokes his head into the drawer when they start crying and has taken to lying right beside the drawer. Now if I could just get him to quit barking at the wandering geese at 6am, I would be so happy.   Business front: All's quiet there too. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. According to the State's website, we still have our certification. There just isn't any news one way or the other. Phone calls have been placed but no return calls. Still no sign of our DBE cert either. I refuse to draw negativity, suffice it to say, it just sounds like the state.   As for Da 'Shroom... well, I'm not sure. Maybe it's planetary alignment.. maybe it's even GQS (we do share a braincell)... maybe it's just me... but there's this inner sense of restlessness, of questioning... of the scales not being harmoniously balanced and I am not sure why. Being realistic I know this mood will pass, being curious, I want to know where the hell it came from and why. I am not feeling dissatisfied. I don't feel useless. I don't feel like I haven't accomplished anything with my life because I know dang well I have. Part of me dislikes the daily routine, part of me wouldn't trade it for the world. It has occurred to me that maybe I need to get away from here for a day or two, reground myself as it were. By this time last year we had gotten away a few times. With business being slow, I rather play the ant to the grasshopper. Last year it was the grasshopper's turn. It's not like I don't have projects pending or in the works because I do. I just don't think that's what is ailing me at the moment. Well, I'm bound to figure it out, sooner or later, or the mood will change. It always does. I just need to lie low and let it wash over me. When stuff like this hits me, I start doing little everyday things, simple things and everything else works itself out.

      Where do I start? What a weekend. Friday's Reba McEntire concert was marvelous. She sings from the heart. She did a a song called, "Forever Love". I believe that's the title of it. The song went out to our military personnel. There were photos flashed up on the screen behind her. The final one that coincided with the end of the song was a picture of a cemetery, row upon row of simple, unadorned crosses, each flying a small US flag. I don't believe there was a dry eye in the place. The end of the concert was not to be the end, with the chanting of her name that grew louder and louder, Ms. McEntire returned to stage to do one last number. I must confess, it was my first ever concert. I just never had the opportunity to go before.   Sunday afternoon The Sprout, Troll and I went to see "Arthur". The hubby had to do some volunteer work at the Veterans Hall. If you haven't seen it yet, you better leave all your preconceived ideas of Arthur, Guinevere and Merlin behind. You won't get anything you're use to seeing or reading there. It not only puts a different spin on Arthur and his knights, but it seems to offer a much more realistic view. I will admit, as much as I liked it, I still like my romantic view of Arthur too. I think the story could have been more developed in regards to the characters and perhaps in regards to Camelot too. Although "Arthur" centered more around the man, his knights and his future queen than anything else. I don't think it will be a smashing blockbuster hit in the theatre, but I know I'll buy the dvd if and when it comes out.   Oh yes! One other thing. Switch gears here. Our other contractor paid off too. The wench from hell got her money over the weekend. That should keep her happy for, oh, at least a week. She'll be back to nagging us over the other account, the one that looks like the funds will come out of our own pocket since my hubby is the one who erred. Long story, don't want to go there. Luckily for us, it is not a fortune. Still, the amount is enough to make me grind my teeth over.   Because I took a sabbatical from the every day, ordinary routine this weekend, I have much to do to catch up. I caught up on my writing for the moment. I'm good to go until my writing partner tosses something out. Now if only I could quit falling asleep and missing him online. The mild weather we experienced last week is coming to an end. We're headed back up into the high 90's. Ugh. Not to worry, in a few months I'll be complaining about the cold. *chuckle*

      It's Thursday, already? I know for some people they are probably welcoming the thought that it's nearly the end of the work week. I remember those days. For me, since I work out of my home and the kids are grown, the days seem to blur. While the kids were in school I could keep track of the days and the calendar easier. There's no such thing as a short work week for me so, yeah, the week has flown by.   There is blessed relief in that the heat has abated somewhat. We're talking mid-90's to lower 90's here. It is a delightful welcome.   The hubby came home this morning from an appointment with his doctor. Everything is fine. His PSA count is within normal range. Thank the Lady for small blessings. Next Friday we go to see his oncologist. I am not expecting anything disturbing there. The hubby has not shown any signs that he had before the colon cancer was diagnosed. The blood test showed no change but they want to physically see him anyway. It's going to be a long day as we opted to drive down and drive back all in the same day.   Oh! And the wench from Hell will probably be comforted. We got a check from one of our clients today. Her check is ready and waiting to be mailed. Her company is not all that far from here, perhaps five to ten minutes from my daughter's house and she's about 15 minutes away from me. We could have chosen to take the check to her directly, but I am being adverse. When this season started, she wanted not only a two party check (made out to her company and ours), which was acceptable and a few companies prefer it, but she wanted the payment mailed directly to their office. No way, no how. We gave her the opportunity to bail out of having anything further to do with us, she saw the dollar signs instead, fine, her choice, but I'll be damned if she is going to lay down terms at this late date. There is no reason why the hubby should have to make a special trip to their office just to take them the check, unless she wants to pay for the gas? I hardly think so. Some part of my mind is whispering that when they get this check, probably tomorrow or Saturday, we're going to get a phone call because she is not going to be happy that it came to us at all. Tough cookies, sister. I am not going to allow her to manipulate us, hence my adversity. We expect another check from the other client, probably tomorrow.  Switch gears. The babies are still in my bottom drawer. I have removed my clothing. Sigh. The things I do for the animals around here sometimes. I must be getting old and soft in the head. I was just falling asleep last night and a couple of the babies started up crying. I grabbed a flashlight and went to check on them, hard on my heels was Cheyenne, my female sheltie. We both peered into the drawer and I surmised that the commotion was raised by the fact that one of them either got his milk jug stolen or he couldn't find one. I'm tired. I am not hunting around to find him one either, he can find his own. It's every kitten for themselves, bud..have at it. Cheyenne and I went back to bed. I have to feel for Serenity (mama cat) she is a perpetual milking machine that works on a 24/7 basis.   I think I've found some of the reason for my sleeplessness, a few pebbles in the road of marital bliss as it were. They are things I have to work through and finding some clarity here is not an easy thing. I guess it comes down to what is acceptable to me, what I can live with and what I can't. It's also facing answers of whether or not he can change, how does it all fit into his mental health and who does it damage more, him or I in regards to changes or no changes. It all sounds cryptic to you out there, I know. I am being deliberately vague. One always has to be constantly aware that this is a public journal and sometimes you can't just live in the fish bowl... sometimes, you have to go inside the house.   Plans for this weekend include: Going to the Reba McEntire concert tomorrow evening. Our oldest son and his wife will be there too. I am looking forward to spending some time with them and enjoying the concert. Tentative plans to see " Arthur " at the theatre on Sunday afternoon.

      The new babies are doing well, getting fat. The litter consists of, 2 blacks, 2 grays and two whites. They also break down into 3 males and 3 females. Btw, Sprout won the numbers pool.  The weather this week is suppose to cool down and today seems to be proving it. Yesterday it was 108 degrees F. Today was in the high 90's. It's suppose to cool off as the week progresses.   I haven't been sleeping well at nights, staying up until about 3 or 4 am. I manage to drift off, but I always seem to wake right back up. I don't know what is causing it, but I sure wish it would resolve itself. I also find myself waking up around 6am or so. Yes, I have deep shadows under my eyes, so attractive *snort*.   The wench from hell called yesterday, made my teeth grind. Mr. Mushroom (or Mushy as I fondly call him) called her right back. Hell, I don't know what her problem is. We told her we were looking to get paid this week. It was a long weekend and only the first working day of it. Sheesh. We also got on her about some bills of laden for a claim we need to file with a bonding company in regards to a construction company that bailed out. It's been three months now that we've been requesting it. She mumbled something about making some phone calls. We're talking $14,000.00 here. Hello! The good news is, the companies that owe us money (which we owe to the wench from hell) advised checks went out today. Okay, the check is in the mail... it had better be. I want this woman off our backs so we can stop doing business with her. Of course that isn't going to happen anytime soon, especially until we get this delinquent account off our hands.   I hope the weather does cool down. We have tickets to see Reba McEntire in concert Friday night. It's an outdoor concert, so I don't want to be sweating up a storm... hm, what to wear... yes, definitely clothes... something that keeps the pesty bugs at bay and is still cool.   That's all I can think of for right now from The Grove. I need a nap.

      At about 7:30 am the 'shroom was abruptly pulled from a deep sleep and a weird dream (so she was thankful) by a sound she has known forever. It was a distressed little cry. Leaning over, she shook Mr. Mushy awake and told him she needed his help. The distress call was ongoing and with a bit of thankful silence in the compost pile, she was able to locate the sound. It was coming from her bottom clothing dresser drawer, where she kept her pants and shorts. There lying on the folded clean clothing was the preggers kitty and after digging into the drawer, 'shroom located the newly born kitten that apparently had slid off the clothing and down into a crack between clothes and the drawer front.   Da `shroom sent Mr. Mushy out to get an old sheet in the garage, set there for just this occasion. In the meantime, 'shroom set about removing her clothing, speaking softly to the new mother, who was in the throes of delivering another baby. Swiftly as she could, she removed what clothing she could and laid out the old sheet.   Now Mr. Mushy has raised pedigree dogs for most of his life. He has even delivered a few foals in his time, but kitties are out of his forte. 'Shroom informed him that the new momma will take care of birthing and cleaning up all by herself. 'Shroom did watch over her though. The dogs were banished from the bedroom for the delivery. They were not pleased. They will get over it.   Miss Serenity, the hussy cat, now new mommy, has delivered 6 very hungry babies and the last two are pure white. That is unusual as Miss Serenity and who the household believe to be the daddy, are not white. Now `shroom excelled in genetics in school, so she knows very well how this all works and the possibilities. Right now, she shaking her head over the fact that the 'Zoo' has now grown by six. The idea of kitties and puppies (herding puppies no less) running all over this place is enough to give her the vapors.   And who won the betting pools? Gotta go look that one up. After the search for the aspirin is done.....

      Funny how one starts off in one direction and with nothing more than a phone call, it all changes. What started off as a lazy morning with no direction other than a shower, has turned into something sad.   I have an online friend, a lady I met online about, oh gosh, back when Prodigy had their bulletin boards. We have been friends ever since. I can not tell you how near and dear she is to me. Through the years she has always been there, always watching over me. She lives in Texas, she's nurse. She is one of the most caring, loving people I know. She's a writer and writes for one of the genres that I also write in. I finally got to meet this lovely woman almost a year ago. It was wonderful. She is wonderful, as I always knew she would be. She has been through her lot of ups and downs and we're both Aquarians so I think we understand each other better and often without words. Our differences are that she's a better person than I am or could ever hope to be and that's not just me waxing poetic either. It simply is.   Over the years, she has called me, just to say hello and that usually tells me she was thinking of me. She never expects anything in return. In truth, I would have called her back many times and either I got busy and it got too late or I can't remember her schedule. It's always her calling me and that always makes me feel bad.   Today, she called me. My phone in the bedroom wasn't working and by the time I rushed to the livingroom, she had hung up. When I heard the message on the answering machine, I knew something was up. She never asks me to call her back. I did. Immediately. Her father passed away this morning. She needed me to contact a mutual dear friend for her and it was a done deal. There's not much I wouldn't do for her.   She has my shoulder and my ear, anytime she needs it, no matter the time or day. I know she'll take me up on it if she needs to. Even if she doesn't need me, she knows I am here for her.   Losing a parent is unlike anything I have ever been through. I have seen my share, been through my share of deaths, but when it comes to a parent, it leaves you in a place of no comparison. So, today, I will light a candle for her, her dad, and her family. Today, my heart is somber and sore because she is hurting so and trying to be strong for everyone, including herself. I love her dearly and I wish I could heal her of this pain and know I can not, only Time can do that.   She is a strong woman, with strong and deep spiritual convictions. She understands Life and its cycles. She will come through this and she will be okay. But for right now, she is a daughter, mourning the loss of her dad.   May his crossing be a gentle, warm, loving one.  May she feel the love and strength those who care for her offer up for her use.  May the Lady comfort them all....

      It seems to be shaping up into an easy, quiet, vegetative day. The most energy I have expended so far was to wash the shelties. I have been mentally deciding if I should do some writing while I have the chance, but currently, I am role playing in Camelot.   Camelot... that brings to mind a few other things. The channel is a good one. We are not strict as most role playing channels, out of character chatter is acceptable so long as it does not become a nuisance while others are role playing. When events can lead to a large crowd or just merely a joyful time, everyone has a great time. It is damn near impossible and totally unreasonable to expect we can keep such times always happening. What I can't lay my finger on is in between times and why there isn't a constant flow of role play. One of the things that stands out is the lack of a general storyline for the channel. I also think some people are not sure about joining in on something for fear of putting their foot in wrong. That fear could easily be relieved by asking questions in private to the one who started the line before posting to the general public. Another problem is that most times, it falls to one or two individuals to start some sort of storyline. I still think that Camelot needs a core of writers, people who would draw up outlines of plots for the channel. Then it could be tossed out for others to join in. That way it would not fall to just one or two. There is always writers' block and burnout to consider, but I can not help but think a core of writers would help relieve that. This, a clique, does not make, but merely a base from which to draw from for the enrichment and furtherment of the channel. Others can be added to the core lot from time to time as needed. It may seem contrived, but I don't believe it would interfere with the free form style we endorse. It would not mean that this core of writers would have to constantly come up with some sort of plot for the channel. I would think it sufficient to divide the year up and come up with a few plots for the year. In the interim, others could work it into their own individual storylines or not, as they so choose. I do think the channel needs more than just a general guideline for behavior and channel rules. Individual storylines are always encouraged, but I think to draw the channel in, to make it feel 'whole', there is a need for something that would call for channel involvement.   Okay, I have officially gone brain dead, of course, someone could be cell sucking *ahem*

      Wow. It's Friday again. The week, to me, seems to have flown by. I notice that more and more the older I get. Time is flying by. Funny how it seems to take forever to turn twenty-one and then feels like it's in a stall somewhere around thirty something and by my mid-forties, *zoom*. Now, I have to say here, there still are weeks or even months that seem to dig their toes in the dirt and just drag on through, but those times seem to be getting less frequent.   The kids seem to be settling into their place. They're taking their time with the unpacking. The grandchildren seem to be acting up a bit, but then their routine has been interrupted. I have to caution the daughter so she doesn't try to velcro them to the wall.   The Grove, more fondly known as "The Zoo" is well. Other than the last two rough weeks of barking and growling at each other, we're headed into the Fourth of July weekend quite pleasantly. Now, you all know that is like quicksilver and can change on a whim. I am keeping my baseball bat within arm's length.  The Sprout has just come through a mild case of food poisoning. He must be feeling better, he's been giving me loving grief since he came home from work. Of course not having to sit on a pillow seems to help his winning dispostion *snort*.   Troll is anxiously awaiting for the arrival of tomorrow. Apparently his Distrtict Manager is headed up from Sacramento. Troll's General Manager seems to think he's getting the axe tomorrow, meaning the GM not Troll, btw. I do not feel sorry for the GM at all. Anything that happens to the GM, he brought on himself. It's been a long time coming. The GM has been getting away with so much crap it's unbelieveable. Where does Troll fit into all this? We haven't got the slightest clue. Troll is one of the Asst. Managers and the DM asked if Troll was going to be working tomorrow, which the answer was an affirmative. I guess we will have to wait until tomorrow to find out what goes down. No one knows when the DM is coming up either. The last thing Troll said to me before leaving for work today was, "If the DM shows up early (like 8am early) that will not be a good thing." Troll doesn't think his job is on the line at all, but with the DM in a bad mood all week, one just can't be too sure about anything.   The hubby had to step up to the plate and take over being Captain for the District Veterans Honor Guard, at least until they get everything straightened out. The former captain just upped and quit. I warned the hubby that if this new job stresses him out or affects his health in any way, it's over. Period.   As for me, the little mushroom, my days are intermingled with good and exhausted. I know I need to make some time for me alone. I can feel it. I am starting to feel more and more isolated and that isn't good. I have rolled with the punches these past few weeks and they have taken their toll. I'm just not sure how to go about what needs to be done or how to get from this point to the one I need to be at. Family is everything to me, but I need some seclusion, to regenerate. I also need to find some way to reconnect with a certain part of myself that I've seem to misplaced or lost.... that part... I am not so sure I'll find.....

      This blog probably won't be of much interest to anyone but myself. Writing it out helps put some things into perspective for me. This has to do with role playing online. I have two references here, one is Camelot, medieval role playing in times beyond King Arthur and the second being, Double Moon, an erotic role playing venue. While Double Moon has an online channel, it's seldom used. I think the time factor and real life have a way of crunching it, but we make up for it via our Yahoo Email Group.   I have to say that Double Moon (or DM for short) seems to run fairly well and easily. There is seldom any problem staying within the guidelines that my partner and I have set. When trouble does poke its little nose out, one of us, if not both, roll up a newspaper and smack it. Things settle back in. Over the years, behind the scenes, there have been some growlings, but out of the ears and eyes of us both. Word gets around, I usually find out things. I think the most satisfying thing for me is to provide such a safe and guarded playground for other of like mind to play in. Now and then, my partner and I drop in but we feel no obligation to do so. The list runs itself for the most part and is productive.  I just wish I could get a handle on Camelot's problem. I have been there long enough to qualify as an 'old timer'now, not as 'old' as some, but old enough. Camelot has been accused of having cliques. I can see where it appears that way, but I don't believe it to be true. Like minds attract. Some people are born idea people, some are support, some are action. In business management, we use what each person is good at to the best advantage of the company. I see the channel like that. Some people can create a great storyline, some are better at being supportive or feeding the storyline and some people can take an idea and kick it off the ground. In this case, it seems as if it all falls upon the same shoulders all the time. There also has to be those who keep things in line and focused so plots don't go off the deep end somewhere.   Maybe part of the problem is the lack of definite lines. Someone has to draw a line in the dirt and say, " This is the line. It doesn't get crossed. Period. " The lines are not open to negotiation or interpretation.  In a channel, such as Camelot, it was created by a single person's vision. One can not please all the people all the time. The internet is a broad and vast place. If someone doesn't see something in the same manner or fashion, there is no reason why they can't go off and create their own utopia. This one channel is representative of a single vision, shared by like minds, not minds that can step in and change it to their interpretation or even tweak it to make them comfortable. We have made concessions. We have blurred the lines. Now, there is confusion and chaos. To fix it would take a major overhaul and cause hurtful feelings among some because they have been allowed to play to their whim. Where does it stop? When some get fed up? Do we pick up our toys and disappear? Do we turn the channel over? Or do we stop the nonsense? Do we clean house and begin again? Yes, there is a point when we all have to learn to get along and play nicely together or at least remain civil and play through. When do we stop the actions of a person because they're driving others bonko? When do we say, listen, your character is out of control, reign it in or there's the door? When do we know we have a problem? When more than one person has the same complaint seems logical to me. When do the feelings of one person override the good of the channel? And who has the balls to do anything about it? Is anyone above all this? Yeah. I'd have to say so. Founders. It is their vision, their channel. If I need to get my little arse bent over someone's knee and whalloped for being out of line, so be it. I can't read minds. I can't know if I crossed a line unless someone tells me so. Then I have a choice to make, either I can tow the line or get out.   Because Camelot attracts many diiferent people, it takes a diligent, strong effort to keep Her on subject, in vision. Without that strength, there is chaos and loss of interest. The channel is not a democracy nor does it belong to everyone. It is a gentle dictatorship and belongs to those who founded it. If you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to take your own vision and start something anew.  Build it and someone may come... just leave our playground the way you found it.

      When my husband was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer two years ago, I felt like the rug had been jerked out from under me. My world became, at most, shaky. I went numb for a few days. I said all the right things, gave all the right encouragements, behaved in a 'normal' manner. Inside, I was scared. I didn't want to lose this man that had taken me a lifetime to find. I didn't want to lose the security I had come to know and appreciate. I didn't want the lives of my loved ones turned upside down yet again. The thought of what he and I would have to face, terrified me. I knew I couldn't lose it. I knew I had to be strong and be a constant reminder to him of the things worth fighting and living for and that together, no matter what the odds were to become, we would do it together.  In the course of our relationship there have been times I wanted to choke the living daylights out of him and I'm sure those times are not over yet. He is one of the most giving, loving, caring human beings I know in this world. He has his faults and his problems, so do I, yet we persevere. We've never truly had a 'fight'. We have growled at each other. We have watched the other blow a cork now and then but all in all, there is the love that binds us.  During times of stress, my children have been wonderful. They have pitched in and done what needed to be done so that I might devote my attention to the situation at hand. During these times those handful I call truly friends have been there for me to lean on, to draw strength from, to make me laugh and forget my worries at least for a moment or two. I am truly blessed.  In the last two years, as each test comes back positively, my world gets less shakier and I can feel that rug inching back under my feet again. Today went a long way to restoring those things as well. Today marked the beginning of the third year and his colonoscopy came back clear. The doctor told me that he doesn't believe the cancer will ever come back. I do thank him for that. Does that mean I will be less diligent in my observations of my husband's daily routines? No. Cancer is a rotting, canker sore that raises its ugly head whenever it damn well pleases and to hell with the people it brings pain to. Does it mean I will relax a little now, thank the Lady for the blessing bestowed upon me and enjoy more what is set before me each day? Yes. I can never dismiss cancer, because when it dismisses us, someone has left an aching gap in the life of another.  One day two years ago, cancer knocked on our door and we had no choice but to answer it. Today, it no longer lingers here, but I see its shadow out there. I'll be watching.

      Oh mercy, what day is this? Monday if my calendar isn't lying. Mercury in retrograde. Oh goody. That's sarcasm for those who don't perceive it. If this past weekend is any indication of the ride I need to see out, it's not a pith helmet I need and a deeper foxhole isn't going to help either. I'm leaning toward a stout rope with a big fatty knot on the end, one big enough to sit on and wait out this retrograde. *sigh*  Saturday. Most of the day I was truly a 'shroom, given my Friday, that would be understandable. Saturday evening and part of the early morning of Sunday, Mr. Mushy and I got into it. Needless to say, I did not find myself calm enough to sleep until around 5 am. Sunday dawned way too early for me and we were due over at daughter's house to take care of a few things for her, boxes to go into storage (oh yea, because FB will take forever to get around to it), curtains to hang (we won't go there) and to just spend a wee bit of time with the babies since they haven't gotten to come over until today that is. I had calmed down by Sunday morning, but upset was still my middle name, that is unusual since I seldom ever carry anything of that sort over to the next day. It would serve no purpose. Today is Monday and there is still a purpose, but not the emotion that was raised. You have seen me write the word 'drained' more times than I like. Yet, there is no other word that seems to fit how I feel at this moment. Still, tomorrow will come and I will do what needs to be done because it must be and some small part of my mind will whisper, "How much more?"  Someone very close to me once said, " You just need to be cuddled. "  I'll second that.
