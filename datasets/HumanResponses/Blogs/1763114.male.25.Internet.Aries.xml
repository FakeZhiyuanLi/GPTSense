      By the lovely seaside after having a nice swim, I put my phone into a rock pool of sea water. Drying it out over the weekend, Arrrrghhhh.   Lets all hope for the best...

      Aside from the fact that google is off my favorites list, orkut seems a little strange, I'm sure its fun, just like everything in life when there are lots of people hanging out but I'm gonna stay away for a number of reasons:  1. Unsolicitated mails from loads of people who know people who know you.  2. Who is this Orkut guy anyway, how come he lets us hang out in his place all the time for free? Maybe its cause of this; from orkuts terms of service: "   						By submitting, posting or displaying any Materials on or through the   							orkut.com  service, you automatically grant to us a worldwide,  						non-exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free, perpetual,  						irrevocable right to copy, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly  						perform and display such Materials."  3.  www.gmail-is-too-creepy.com/  4.  www.google-watch.org/   5.    Oscar Wilde: "  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful. To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it is simply a tragedy.  "         Thank you for the Invitation though.
