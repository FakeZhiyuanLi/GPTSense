Hee It's My 1st Time Seein' Valerie But Then Again She Had Seen Me On Photos And The Funny Part Is Tat She's The On Who Spotted Me First Instead!! Hahahaha And So We Chatted For Awhile Before We Bid Farewell To Her And Made Our Way Down To Bugis.. And So We've Reached.. Spent Around 30 Mins Walkin' Around In Search Of The Mysterious Thai Restaurant But In Vain!! LOLL It Jus Vanished !! We Wondered Wat Happened To It.. So We Walked Around More To Decide On Wat To Eat And Guess Wat.. She Spotted Jacelyn Tay !!! Hohohohoho Wat A Pair Of Sharp Eyes She's Got !! Expressive Too !! *I LIKEEEEEEEEEEE* Hehhehe And So Walked Into This Restaurant Named "MISS SAIGON" For Dinner.. Ordered A Plate Of Tester.. *Consists Of 5 Different Type Of Snacks They Offered* And A Bowl Of Beef Slice BeeHoon Soup And We Chatted On Her Child Days When Something Horrible Happened To Her.. A Very Bad Encounter.. *You Know Wat I'm Referin' Too* I Held Her Hands Tight Assurin' Her Tat Nothin' Will Ever Happen To Her When I'm Around.. We Smiled And The Food Arrives !!!! Hmmm Not A Very Huge Servin' For The Tester Plate *The Waiter Even Told Us It's Enuff For 3-4 Servings!! BULLLLLSH*T AHAHAHA* But I Must Say... Nice Chicken Wings They've Got.. And POH PIAS Too.. Errr Perhaps Not For The Vietnamese POH PIA 'Cos It Tasted Funny LOLLLL Not Recommended By The Both Of Us.. Hehehhe Gave Her My Chicken Wing 'Cos She Said It's Nice.. Hehehe How I Enjoy To See Her Eyes Brighten Up When I Said "Nooo Noo Nooo I Dun Wan It.. It's For You." Ehehehe Jus Like A Child.. How Adorable.. *I LOVE YOU!!! ;P* To Ease Trouble Sharin' I Transfer Some Of The Beef Slice BeeHoon Soup Into A Smaller Bowl For Her And Poured Out All Different Kinds Of Sauces Available.. Hehehe As Usual Gas Drinks Makes People Fat Only So We Only Had Plain Water.. Not A Bad Meal I Must Say.. Especially The Beef Slice BeeHoon Soup.. But The Tester Was Abit Of A Disappointment For It's Not Fillin' And As Tasty.. Foot The Bill And Left The Area Went Back To Bugis To Jalan Jalan As She Seldom Been To Bugis @ All.. So We Walked Around And Funny How Often Do We End Up @ The Lingerie Department.. *Evil Grin* LOLLL And So As Linda's 21st BD Is Commin' So We Might As Well Shop Around For A Present Yeah ?? And THONGS Were Made Into Consideration !!! LOLLL Walked Pass A Bridal Shop And Was Discussin' How Each Of Us Would Look Like In 'Em.. I Can Already Picture How Beautiful And Gorgeous She'll Be... I Always Believe Tat If You're Nice Lookin' You'll Look Great In Any Outfit And Sweetie You Totally Fit The Bill !!!!! Passby The Restaurants @ Level 2 And The Looks Of The Food Made Me Hungry Again.. LOLLLL Headed For MacDonald And Order A Large ICE Tea Together With The Promotional $2 Nuggets Hehehehehehe But She Insisted On Payin' !!! Sweetie You Know You've Got Only $5 A Day.. So If I Could Afford I'll Pay.. It's Okay.. You Can Use The Money For Your Own.. :((((( We Crapped And Joked In The Mac And It Lasted All The Way Even When We're On The MRT Headin' Back To Tampines.. Hehehehe I Can Tell She's Really Havin' A Great Time Laffin' As Her Laughter Was Non Stop !! Hahhaah We Were The Attention Of The Whole Cabin..

      July 10th 2003.. It's Her Exam Today.. Stayed Up The Entire Night With Her Yesterday.. Was Her Anti Stress Depressant.. There Were Times When I Really Can't Take It Anymore.. As In The Z.z.z..z.z.zz Monster Tried To Grab Me To Bed.. But I Won The WAR !! Ahahahahaha.. Was Too Worried For Her Too.. Such Little Sleep.. I Dunno If She Could Take It.. Anyway.. Gave A Wake Up Call @ 540am And 615am Hehehe As Her Dad Was Givin' Her A Lift To School.. Was Bloggin' Bout Our Day Out On The 7th Of July So I Slept @ Around 7am.. PErhaps I Was Too Tired... I Only Managed To Crawl Out My Bed @ 1045.. Was SHOCKED @ How Little Time I've LEft !!! Took A Quick Shower And Off I Go !!! Took A Cab Down As I Was Afraid To Be Late.. 'Cos I'm Meetin' Her @ 12noon. Reached Her School Earlier Then I Expected.. But It Was Only When I'm In The Toilet Then I Realized Tat I've Not Gotten Her Any Rose !!!! DAMN IT !! But It's Too Late.. I Can't Simply Take A Cab Down To Some Florist And Leave Her There Waitin'.. So I Was Thinking To Myself.. Since We're Goin' Down To Orchard.. PErhaps We Could Walk Pass Some Florist Along The Way.. And The Weather Wasn't Great Either.. Was Raining And Drizzlin' Despite The Sun.. Asked Her Bout Her Paper While We Walked To The Bus Stop To Catch Bus 143 To Orchard. I Could Sense Tat She's Very Tired From The Way She's Restin' On My Shoulders.. It Must Have Been HArd On Her.. :((((((( Went Straight Up To CineLeisure Once We Alighted.. Lunch Will Be @ LIPS CAFE !!! But B4 Tat We Were Like Should We Be Watchin' A Show ?? CITY OF GODS !! Hehehe Yeah The Show We Were Supposed To Watch Back On The 4th Of July *YEAP NOT DISCOVERY OF HEAVEN THIS TIME ROUND" So We Bought 2 Tix For The Movie Which Would Only Start @ 1910 * -_____- * As She Didn't Had Much Sleep For The Pass Few Days Especially The Day B4 Her Papers.. I'm Worried Tat She Couldn't Take The Tiredness.. ;(((((((((((((( *SiGh* So After Gettin' The Tix We Proceeded To LIPS CAFE For Lunch. Ordered A Different Set Lunch Each So Tat We Could Share.. Hehehe And Of Course.. *DrumRolls* NY CHEESECAKE !! Ehehehehe.. Spent Bout 2 1/2 Hrs There As We Had A Slow Lunch And Was Gossiping Around While She's On The Magazine.. Hehehe.. Was Busy Feedin' Each Other Too.. Ohhh IT's Jus So Good To Be Real.. *Pinched Myself* Ouchhh.. Really.. The Cheesecake Seems To Be The Sweetest Desert I've Ever Had. ;PppPPpPppPppPPppPP So After Lunch We Went Around CineLeisure As It Was Still Raining And Guess Wat ?? She Actually Bumped Into Gareth!! Hahaha.. Singapore Is Indeed A Really Small Place.. Anyway The Rain Finally Stopped.. So We Stepped Outta CineLeisure And Headed To ESPIRIT To Do Some Window Shoppin' Suddenly Her Dad Called And Ask Her Where She Was And Why Didn't She Bought Lunch Back From Shenny And She Had To Lie Tat She's With Her Schoolmates. Went To TAKASHIMAYA Shortly After.. Window Shoppin' Around For Bout An Hr Ehehehehe.. We Went To Tiffany & Co To Look Look.. Hahahahaha She Said Tat We Dress So Lok Go In Abit The PaiSeh Hehehe But I Said NeverMind We're Jus Takin' A Look It's No Big Deal Right ?? So We Went In. Wow.. I Tell Ya The Jewels Available Inside Were Stunnin'.. *Same Goes To The Price* She Tried On A Ring Which Cost $24k *OoOOOoOOoOOooOooOooOO* But To Tell The Truth.. She Look Great With It.. Sigh If Only I Could Afford It.. I Would've Got It For Her.. ;((( Left Tiffany & Co To Oprah's Gallery To Browse Around.. Ohhhh The Arts Were Great.. Now I Know Why Some Artist Could Really Earn Alot.. A Painting Can Easily Fetch Up 10k Or More!!! :D~~~~~~ $$$$$$$$$$ Well Actually She Wanted To Visit Her Friend Valerie @ Zara But Due To Time Constriction We've Gotta Go Back To CineLeisure For The Show.. So We Abandoned The Idea And Had Dinner @ YOSHINOYA. Bumped Into 2 Guys Which We Saw Earlier @ LipsCafe.. She Told Me Tat One Of The Keep Kept Starin' OVer And I Went All * -________________________- * Becareful Guys.. Becareful.. Grr.r.r...r.r.r.rr.rr.rrrr Had A Full Dinner So No Popcorns Nor Drinks For The Show !!! So We Sat Down And Relax Back To Watch The Show.. Then Something Happened.. My HP RANG !!! Arghh I Forgot To Turn Off/Slient My HP !! Darn It !! I Could See The Look From Her Face.. Oh God.. She's Pissed !!!!! Damn It !! But I Can't Deny Tat It's Not My Fault.. I Can Only Admit And Acknowledge My Own Carelessness.. Tat's All I Can Do.. But She Kinda Like Darted Away From Me.. And Crossed Her Hands Which Was Suppose To Be Holdin' Mine.. I Was Devastated.. I Know Tat I'm In Deep Sh*t.... I Was Lost @ Wat To Do.. I Laid Back Feelin' Down.. I Couldn't Even Concentrate On The Movie.. I Looked Away Coverin' My Face.. My Mind Was Completely Blanked.. The Heart Felt Heavy And The Breathin' Went Sighin'. I Really Dunno Wat To Do.. I Think It Lasted For 15 Mins.. I Dare Not Speak To Her.. Dare Not Look @ Her.. Am Afraid Tat She'll Give Me The Stare And Look Away.. I Couldn't Take Tat... I'll Feel Hurt And Remorseful.. But Things Jus Can't Be Lydat.. Finally I Turned To Her And Said In A Tremblin' Voice.. "I'm Sorry..." I Have Tat I'm Really Sorry Look On My Face.. I Repeat Myself Again.. "I'm Really Sorry.." Gosh I Felt Like Cryin'.. I Know I'm In The Wrong.. I'm Sorry Sweetie.. I Screwed Things Up..  She Never Said Anything Except Lookin' @ Me.. She Reached For My Hand And Hold It... I'm Speechless.. I Almost Burst Out My Tears.. I Held Her Hands Back Tightly Too. We Finished The Show Hands Holdin' Each Other's.. Walked Out Of CineLeisure After The Show.. As It's Already Passed 2100 Then.. I Urged Tat We Should Go Back Already.. I'm Really Worried Tat She'll Fall Sick Again... I Dun Anything To Happen To Her.. But She Said It's Alright.. So We Walked Down Orchard Towards ISTANA PARK.. On The Way She Asked Me Where's The Rose Tat I Promised To Give Her Everytime We Met.. AGain I Went Dumb.... I Told Myself.. "Tat's It.. First I Made Her Pissed @ The Movies.. Now I'm Breakin' My Promise.. I'm A Gonner.. I'm Such A LetDown.. I Never Made Her Happy.. I Even Broke My Promise Tat I Made To Her.. I'm Such A Failure.. I'm Such A Loser.. Such Incompetence.. A Fool.." I Failed Totally As A Boyfriend.. Sigh.. Wo Zhen Shi Ge DA ZHU TOU !!!!!!! I Hate Myself So Much.. OH SO MUCH.. Although She Said It Was Alright And She's Not Mad But I Can Sense Tat She's Disappointed.. And I'm SUCH A LETDOWN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh I So Wanted To Kill Myself.. So I Tried To Look Okay Jus So Tat I Wouldn't Make The Situation Worse.. ISTANA PARK Was Full Of People Already.. So We Went Over To Plaza Singapura To Check Out The Next Underground Passage Which Links The New NORTH EAST Line.. *Actually It's So Tat I Could See Whether I Could Get A Rose From There.. But Alas The Florist Had Already Closed* Time Was Runnin' Out.. So I Sent Her Home.. My Mood Wasn't Gettin' Any Better.. Only Got Worse.. But I Still Smiled And Laugh Along The Way.. It Was Only When We Parted From Her Place And I Was LEft Alone Did All My Emotion Rushed Out.. I Hung My Head Low.. Sighin' As And When I Could.. Frowned All The Way Back Home As I Stoned On The Bus.. This Was Wat She Sent Me When I Reached Home....  " Funny How Time Can Make Relationships More Colorful And Dull On The Other Hand! Actually Just Wanna Let You Know Tat I'm Sori For My Behavior Today! I Really Wanna Treasure You As Well As You Do For Me. Am Sorry For My Mean Attitude And If I've Hurt You Deep! :( GTG ZzZ LEr.. Shall Tok To You Lata! Oh, No Inspiration 4 A Goodnight SMS Today Huh ?.. Wat A Let Down Today =( "  I Was Composin' A GoodNight Msg For Her When This Msg Came In.. Upon Receivin' It And After Readin'.. I Felt Worse.. It's Not Your Fault Sweetie.. It's All Mine.. It's All Mine.. I Was Being Such A Loser.. And Yes.. Am Really A LetDown.. I Felt Shameful.. Totally Ashamed Of Myself.. It's Not Your Fault Sweetie.. It'll Never Be.. I've Never Been Mad , Angry Or Pissed @ Anything You'd Do.. I Love You Too Much Already.. I've Given My Heart So Totally To You.. I Love You Sweetie.. I Love You.. And I'll Always Cherish The Times We Spent Together And Things We've Done..

      July 25th Fri.. Chatted Over The Phone After The Trip And Somehow I Screwed Things Up.... I Could Sense Over The Receiver She's Upset.. And I'm Not Feelin' Any Better.. In Fact I FELT WORSE !!! So I Decided To Take A Trip All The Way Down To Her Place Even If It's Already 2350.. So Shortly I Put Down The Phone I Was On My Way.. Along The Way I Was Thinking Of Ways To Pacify Her.. Cheer Her Up.. Somehow I Felt Tat We Need To Talk Things Out.. And So I Reached The MANGOSTEEN.. And I Called And Told Her I'm Downstairs.. @ First She Said She's Not Cumin's Down.. So I Said It's Okay.. I'll Jus Spent The Night Inside The MANGOSTEEN.. Really.. Honestly.. I Never Wanted Her To Come Down.. Perhaps It's Jus Me.. I Jus Need To Chill.. So Sittin' Inside The MANGOSTEEN.. I Took Out The Photo Print She Gave Me On Our Anniversary And I Jus Stared Hard Into.. Memories Soon Filled My Mind.. The Very Fatefool Day.. When I Was Revealin' To Her Bout How I Felt.. From There I Started To Go Into Deep Thoughts.. *Stoning* Can't Help It.. Tears Were Already Floodin' My Eyes.. And The Next Thing I Knew... I Teared.. I'm Such A Fool... To Make Her Angry.. And Upset.. I'm Feelin' Ten & Thousands & Millions Times Worse.. As I Dried My Tears And Carried On Stoning She Appeared.. As Beautiful And As Lovely As Ever.. So We Hugged.. Sat Down And Talked.. Suddenly She Jus Pop This Sentence Which Really Took Me By Surprised.. And Shattered My Heart.. I've Never Felt So Scared.. So Lost.. So Hurt In My Life.. All Jus In A Sentence.. I Tasted Hell.. She Said " Lets Jus Be Friends Okay? " Do You Know @ Tat Very Exact Moment.. I FELT LIKE DYING !! I Can't Believe My Ears.. I FELT LIKE I'VE JUS LOST EVERYTHING IN MY WORLD !!!.. ARGHHHHHH I Cried... I Couldn't Take It Much Longer.... I Cried.. I've Never Experience Such Pain.. Then She Said It's All A Joke..But I Was Already All Taken In By Wat She Said Earlier On.. It Took Quite Sometime Before I Was Back To Normal Again.. Although Those Were Jus Jokes.. But I Was Really Hurt.. I Thought To Myself.. Is Tat It ??? After Being Together And Tat's Tat ?? Wat Have I Done To Deserve All These..I Was Really Damn Heart Broken.. I'll Never Joke Bout This Kinda Issues.. Never.. For I'd Never Wanna Leave You.. I'd Be By Her Side.. Till Time Runs Out.. For I LOVE HER MAHHHHHHHHHHHHH.. SiGh.. Really.. Too Deep Ler.. I Can't Help Myself.. I Love You Sweetie.. And As It's Getting's Late I Suggested To Her To Go Back & Rest.. And Then I Realized Tat She's Got Some Funny Scratches Between Her Middle & 4th Finger.. Some Kinda Allergy.. So I Insisted Tat I'll Accompany Her To The Doc.. 1st Thing In The Mornin'.. After Tellin' Her All Tat I Escorted Her Back Up.. So Again I'll Be Sleepin' Somewhere Tonight.. Not In My Bed Of Course.. In The Open.. Lovin' You LOADS SWEETIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MUAAHAHAHAHHA Ooooo I Can't Wait !!! I Can't Wait.. So After Payin' For The Tix I Return Back To Muchuan For Further Practice.. And Yes The Big Time Has Come.. My Performance Starts From 9pm And Ends @ 10pm.. I Was Really Lookin' Forward Of Seein' Her Walkin' Through The Enterance So I Kept Staring Towards The Direction.. But Then Again.. As I Was Singing The 1st Song.. Her Msg Came In.. SHE CAN'T MAKE IT !!! Said Tat She Needed To Help Zing To Paint Her Room.. I Was Like.. Ohhh It's Okay.. Nevermind.. Next Time Lor.. But I Was Feelin' All Blue And Sad Inside.. Sigh.. I Wanted So Much For Her To Be There..I've Gotta Put On A Smile On Stage Even Though I Felt Like Sh*t.. Hahahah Wat To Do ?? Gotta Show Professionalism Mahhhh.. And So As I Was Bout To Fin. The 2nd Song She Came !!!! LOLLLLLLLLL She Bluffed Me !!! How Lydat ??? Kkekekekekeke.. Made Me Thought Tat She Won't Be HEre.. Gr.r.r.r.rrr And Guess Wat ??? She Brought Shenny Along !! LOLLLL Tat's My 1st Official Meetin' With Shenny..  Only Heard Her Through The Phone.. So My Mood Got Better.. ALOTTTTTT Ehehehe.. So As I Was Singing I'll Always Peep Over To See Her Or Give Her The 512 Hand Signal !!!!  Kekeke And Shenny Was Like Cannot Take It Ler !! Either She'll Turn Away Or Jus Laugh/Giggle Hehehehe And So After Singing All The Songs The Audience Dedicated I Finally Sang Some Songs I'll Always Wanted To Sing To Her.. Perhaps She Never Heard 'Em B4 But It Sure Means Alot To Me.. To Have Her There Listenin'.. I Love You Sweetie !!!!!! And So After Singing We Chatted For Awhile Because Shenny Was Hungry.. So They Ordered Some Snacks *Crispy Chicken I Still Remember* HEhehe And After Everything We LEft As It Was Gettin' Late Lerrr And Shenny Has School Tomorrow.. Ohhh And I Forgot To Bring My Digi Cam Along For Her... So I Suggested Tat We MAke A Trip To My Place B4 Sendin' Her Back As I Live Nearby And So We Made Our Way Towards The Clark Quay MRT Station.. Hahahah I Tell Ya Shenny Is So Funny & Weird.. She Kept Walkin' Either Behind Us Or Far Towards The LEft.. Hahahaha I HAve No IDea Why She Does Tat But It Made Me Felt Awkward Hehehe And So We Reached The MRT And Her Dad Called And Scolded Her For BRinging Shenny Out And Not Makin' It A Point To Bring Her Back Home Early For Shenny Has School The Next Followin' Day.. I Can See The Change In Her Expression When She Put The Phone Down.. HEr Eyes Was All Watery Already!!! GOSHHH How LYDAT ??? My Heart ACHES So Much.. To See Her In Tat State.. She Din't Even Wanna Talk To Me !! Not Even Look.. Aw.w.w. Sweetie.. I'm Sorry.. Shouldn't Had Asked You Over To Listen To My Performance.. Now See Wat Happened... Sighhh... Why I Always Make HEr So Sad One ?? I'm Such A Lousy Bf.. ;(((((((( I Held Her Hands Assurin' Everything's Gonna Be Okay.. Dun Worry.. Daddy's Only Worried.. After Much Consoling She Felt Better.. Cracked A Few Jokes And Again I Saw Tat Most Amazin' Smile.. And So I Called My 2nd Bro On The Phone And Asked Him To Bring The Digi Cam Down To The MRT For Me So We Could Save Time.. And Yes It's The 1st Time She's Seein' My Brother !! Same Goes To Shenny! Hahahahaha I'm Tellin' Ya They're Gonna Be So Shocked By The Difference Between Us Hehehe And They DID !!! Hehehehe She Kept Tellin' Me My Bro Is Much More Handsome.. GOT MEHHHHH ??? Hehhe Well So After Gettin' The Digi Cam I Walked 'Em Out To Get A Cab Back Home.. I Wanted To Send Her Back But She Insisted Tat She'll Go Back Alone.. Didn't Wan Her To Be Angry.. I Finally Gave Into Her IDea Of Goin' Back With Shenny.. So I Jus Stuff $10 To Her For The Cab... Although We Only Met Up For Like 3 Hrs But It Really Meant Alot To Me... Every Min Every Sec I Spent With Her Are All So Precious.. I LovE You Sweetie..

I'm So Excited And Am So Eager To Be With Her.. I Really Missed Her Alot... Can You Imagine Days Not Being Able To Be With Her.. Tell Ya It's Worse Than Hell.... And Then It's Finally Her.. The DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Ehehehehehe.. Went To Her House In The Afternoon As We Decided To Go For The Food Festival @ Singapore Expo And Then After Tat We'll Bring Her Printer To HP Service Centre To Repair But Then Again...After Callin' The HP Customer Service Line Did We Realized Tat It's Closed For Half Day On Sat.. So We've Gotta Give Up On The Idea Of Sendin' The PRinter For Service.. Tat Means We're Not Meetin' Her Dad After Our Trip To Singapore Expo...Bidded Her Mom Farewell Before We Head Down To Our FOOD FEAST!!! Ehehehehe And So We Reached.. But Only To Feel Disappointed.. It's More Like A Retail Market Rather Then A Food Festivial.. All We See Are Kiasu Aunties & Uncles Fightin' To Taste Free Samples.. Well There Is A Few Stalls There Tat Actually SERVES But We Never Had Alot.. Had A Fried Drumstick Followed By Some New Food Whereby It's Mushroom Wrapped Around With Chicken And Beef.. Had FishCakes Also.. After Tat We Got Ourselves A Shao Bao And A Char Chao Bing!! NICE NICE... Walked Around Further.. Bought Some Chicken Rolls.. *Jap Grilled Style* And Tampura.. She Treat Me Drink GAN ZHE SHUI !! LOLLL With Lemon Somemore.. I Remember We Tasted Some Free Sample.. Lastly I Had A TAI WAN XIAN CHANG !!! LOLLLLL ALL Time Fav. Food Of Pasamala!!! Eheheeheh.. Walked Around Further More.. Wanted To Buy Some Kaya One.. But Then The Kaya They Have There Not Nice ONEEE So We NEver Bought Any.. Passed By This Pastry Stall And Bought A Small Box Of Durain Roll !! Eheheh And It's As Hard As A Rock.. Perhaps It's Because They Freeze It.. And The Whole Entire Day Was Raining.. Seems Like My Plan Of Watchin' A Movie @ Stella Arotis.. 'Cos I Took Part In This Competition To Win This Pair Of Tickets For The Sci Fi Event Hosted By Singapore Science Centre.. And I Really Won !!! So I Thought It'll Be A Surprise For Her.. But The WEATHER SUXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Darn It !!!! ;(((((((((((((((( So All I Can Do Is To Hope For The Better.. So After Leavin' The So Called "Food Festival" Thingie We Proceeded Down Towards Bugis.. But Then Both Of Us Smell Like BBQ !!! Hahahaha So I Suggested We Go Spray Some Free Perfume @ SEIYU.. Ehehehe Tried On A Few Before We Took A Look @ Watches @ The NearBy Counter.. And Then She Saw This "Swiss Army" Brand Watch Which Reminded Her Of Wat IVAN Gave It To Her.. Eheheh So She Ask To See The PAckagin' For The Watch 'Cos There's A So Called Pirated Brand For Swiss Army Watches Labeled "NEW Swiss Army" Ehehehe.. Looked Around The Swatch Shop Too.. Got My Watch Shortened @ The Belt.. 'Cos It's Gettin' Looser & Looser Lerr.. So I Took Out One Part Of The Belt To Tighten It.. Went Around Shoppin' @ Parco For My Business Pants.. And Shoes.. But To No Avail.. ehehehe So We Dropped By V8 Cafe To Have Our Dinner.. I Tell Ya The Food @ V8 Is Not Bad Leh.. Very Nice And Very Affordable.. So We Had Chicken Chop,Chicken Baked Rice And A Salmon Salad....Ehehehe Nice Leh.. Really Very Nice.... We Chatted For Awhile Before Leavin' The Place And I Recalled Tat I Needa Get A White Polo T For Work So We Went Over To Giordano In Search Of My Polo T... As I Usually Wear Size "M" And After Wash I'll Be Like Stretched Bigger And All So I Ask For Size "S".. The Shop Asst. Instead Of Helpin' Me Findin' It Actually Laff @ Me.. MY GOD I'M SO DAMN PISSED With His Attitude.. Why??? Is It Because I'm Freakin' Fat So I Cannot Wear "S" Is It ?? I'm So Mad I Said "Nevermind!!" And Walked Away Look @ Other Stuffs.. Damn It.. I'm Really Pist.. I Felt So Humiliated..  GDI !!!!! ARghhhh Went Off In A Cab And Head For Fort Cannin' As Time Was Runnin' Out.. Reached There Like In A Jiffy 'Cos Bugis Is Actually Very Near To Fort Cannin' Hahahahahaha.. Exchanged Our Tickets @ The Enterence And It Was Lucky Tat We Got There Eariler.. Seats Are Not Taken Up Yet.. We Managed To Find For Ourself A Sweet Spot So We Laid Everything Out.. The First Movie Started And It's "The Iron Giant".. A Cartoon Actually... I Can Tell Tat She's Sleepy Ler 'Cos She's Fallin' Asleep In My Arms.. I Jus Hold Her Nearer & Tighter 'Cos She Complained Tat It's Cold.. And Her Nose Kept Runnin'... And When The Movie Is Bout To End.. She Woke Up !!! LOLL Talked About Perfect Timmin' Eh ?? Hahahaha

So This Time Round I'll Definitely Pass It.. So I Went To Work In The Morning As Usual.. Left The Office Earlier To Study For My Advance Inside The MAC Located @ BoatQuay.. Studied Till 1730 Before Headin' Back Home To Change And Get Ready For The Commin' Test.. Set Off To Ubi And Took My Test @ 1830.. Went In Confidently And Finished The Paper Within 45mins.. Am Very Satisfied With My Performance And So I Headed Down Straight To Her Place As I Promised HEr Tat I'll HElp Her With Her I.A Essay Which She's Havin' A Headache With... Reached Her Place And Guessed Wat ?? She Prepared Potato Salad For MEEEEEE.. Aw..w.w.w.w How Sweet Of Her.... Tell Me How Can I Not Love Her More ??? After The Meal We Started On Her Essay And She Assigned Me To Do Certain Things On The I.A Essay For Her.. Well Not Some Difficult Shit.. Jus Typin' And Rearrangin' Some Referrals She Got From The NEt.. And So I Did As Told.. And By The Time Everything Was Done.. It's Already Passed Midnight.. And So I Guess It's Gonna Be Jus The Void Deck And Me Again Tonight.. Hahahahaha And While I Was Helpin' Her With Her Remaining I.A Essay Out In The Livin' Room Zing Showed Us This Wooden Trick Chest And Challenged Us To Open It.. After Much Attempts On The Chest.. We Gave Up.. Hahahaha But Still Zing Never Reveal To Us How To Open The Box But She Did Showed Us Wat It Looked Up After Opening It Up!! Hahahahaha -____- And She Popped Another IQ Question For Me To Solve It.. And Before I Could, She Fell Asleep On Her Bed But Before Tat She Told To Me To Wake Up Her @ 0200... Didn't Wanna Disturb Her Sleepin' I Decided To Go Back Out To The Livin' Room To Help My Sweetie Out With Her Essay.. But Then I Realized Tat She's Sleepin' On The Sofa Too !! In A Very Weird Position Somemore.. So Wake Her Up Telling Her To Sleep Better In Case She Gets All The Pain Over The Neck Again... Told Me To Get Her Pillow For Her.. And I Did.. Soon Enuff She Dozed Off On The Sofa Holdin' On My Hand... Only After Confirmin' Tat She's Asleep Did I Remove My Hand From Her To Blog Usin' Her IBOOK.. Eheheheehhehe But I Only Managed To Blog Till 0430 Before I ConCuzzzed On The Sofa Beside Her Too.. Woke Up @ Around 0515 And Found Tat She's Awake Too.. Hugged Her Real Tight.. Before I Got To Go Catch My First Bus Back Home... Hugged Her Again... Tighter This Time.. With So Much Fear She'll Leave Me.. I Love You Sweetie.. From The Very First Day Till My Very Last.. Love You MAHHH !!! ;PpPPpp

      Sept 13 Sat.. It's BBQ DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Ahahahahahahahha.. Finally After My Work For The Pass Few Days I Can Have One Entire Day To Relax & Enjoy Myself With Her... And Today We're Goin' To ECP To BBQ With Her SIA Friends As They're Havin' A Gathering There.. So After Helpin' Her To Print Her Assignments For Her PR Submission We Met Up @ Her Place Before Proceedin' To Tampines Central To Get Some Batteries For Zing's Mini Hifi As We're Supplyin' The Music To The BBQ Ehhehehe.. Alighted @ Marine Parade Before We Took A Cab Down To CARPARK G *Which's The Furtherest Away From All BBQ Pits* It Took Us Quite Awhile B4 We Reached There And We're Early Too.. 'Cos The Fire Wasn't Even Started Yet !!! People There Are Chewin' On Chop Vegetables Sticks !! LOLLL So We(GUYS) Set Up The Fire.. (After Borrowin' Charcoals And Lighters Plus Matchsticks) But The Problem After Which Was There's Fire But No FOOD Except ORTARS So Jude And I Fork Out $$$ To Buy Wire Mash, Tongs, Alum Foil And Of Course.. More CHARCOALS!!! We Actually Returned The Charcoals Back To Our "NEIGHBORS" Before We Actually Start Some Serious BBQin'.. You Can Call Me CHEF Jiang As I Was Busy BBQin' All The Food For Everyone.. As A Result I've Sustain Burn Injuries On All My Fingers.. YOUCHHHH!!! I'm Tellin' Ya It Hurts.. So As Jude And I Were Busy With The Food The Rest Chatted And Joked Among 'Emselves Talkin' Bout When Will SIA Be Callin' 'Em Back For Training And All I Couldn't Help But Felt All Moody & Sad.. But I Never Showed It Out As I Know She's Got Friends There.. So I Jus Smiled And Laughed As Usual Jus Tat I'd Spend More Time On BBQin' Rather Then Interactin' With The Rest.. And So The BBQ Went On Pretty Fine.. Photo Takin' Session Here & There.. And All I Do Was To BBQ & BBQ & BBQ More Food !! LOLLLLLLLLLLL And All Good Times Must Come To An End.. We Left Together With Jude And Linda As Jude Was Drivin'.. Because Linda Stays In Bedok So They'll Be Sendin' Us Back To Tampines.. Chatted With Jude & Linda In The Car On The Journey And Thanked 'Em For The Ride B4 Gettin' Out Of The Car And Headed Back Home To Her Block.. Ehehehe Was Stinked By The BBQ Smell And It Was All Over Me.. So I Took A Shower @ Her Place And Stayed For Awhile Before I Made My Way Do To The Playground To Sleep.. As I Was Walkin' Towards My Fav. Sleepin' Spot For The Nite (THE PINEAPPLE PLAYGROUND) I Was A Couple Of Teenagers Settin' The Place On Fire !!! They're Burnin' The Tyres On The Playground.. OMG.. Youngsters Nowadays.. Have Got Nothing Better To Do.. Sigh.. I Couldn't Get To Sleep As I Lay Wide Awake @ The Stands Of The Soccer Court Starin' @ The Sky.. All Of A Sudden While I Was Gazin' @ The Moon My Handphone Rang And She's On The Other Line Askin' Me Where Am I And When I Turned My Head Around I Can See Her Walkin' Towards Me.. I Was Shocked !! It's So Late And She's Walkin' ARound Lookin' For Me.. Gosh Am I Worried Or Wat.. Seems Like She's Down Lookin' For Me To Pass My Watch Back To Me.. I Sent Her Back Up Again.. Sigh I Dunno Why I'm Moody.. Perhaps The Thought Of Seein' Her Lesser And Lesser Each Day Jus Got To Me.. And Eventually When She Starts To Fly.. I Dunno I Can Take It Or Not.. All I Know Is Tat I Love Her So So Much And I Can't Bare To Live A Day Away From Her.. Not Hearin' Her Voice.. I'm Hooked On To Her.. For I Love Her Too Much.. I Love You Mah Sweetie.. I Love You.. ;(((

      Sept 4th Thur.. I Couldn't Sleep Last Night.. I Was Wide Awake.. My Tears Jus Accompanied Me Throughout The Entire Night.. I Was Stonin' @ The Walkway Outside My Flat.. I Was So Sad... So So Hurt.. So So Hate Myself... I Was Totally Depressed.. Totally Moodless... I Was Blamin' Myself... Hitin' Myself... Scoldin' Myself... And The More I Thought Bout It.. The Worse I Felt.. All Through The Night... My Eyes Were Red... The Mind's Blank Till Dawn Break....I've Got No Mood To Smile.. No Mood To Eat.. No Mood To Talk.. No Mood To Listen... No Mood To Work... No Mood To Do Pratically Anything.. I Regreted Deeply For Wat I've Done.. I Should've Never Hang Up On Her... I Dun Wanna Talk Bout It Either Sighh.. I Was Completely Shattered.. Torn.. I've Never Felt So Worst Before.. Perhaps It's Because I Miss Her Too Much.. Knowin' Tat We'll Not Be Meetin' As Often.. Perhaps Even As Little As Once A Week.. I Couldn't Help To Feel Tat Way.. It Really Hurts.. Knowin' Tat You Won't Be Spendin' Time With The One You Treasure And Love So Much.. It's Like Askin' Me To Survive Without Air.. I'd Die.... Honestly I Think I Will... So Throughout The Whole Product Training My New Company Was Givin' Me.. I Couldn't Care LEss.. I Was Jus Gazin' @ The Photograph In My Wallet And Readin' Wat's Behind It.. ULTRA SAD AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... Sigh.. Then I Kept Lookin' @ My Handphone Every One Min.. Hopin' To See A SMS Or To Receive A Call From Her.. But Didn't.. I Sighed Every 30 Seconds Or So.. There's No Life In Me.... So After My Trainin' Ends Around 3pm I Called HEr.. From Her Tone I Know She's Pist.. Angry.. Hated Me.. Then I Felt Even Worst.. I Was By Boat Quay When I Called HEr.. Walkin' Around Aimlessly Till I Set Down By Singapore River.. I Dunno Why.. Tears Jus Flowed Out.. I Couldn't Control It.. I've Never Cried For YEARSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS... I Can Tell You This Yr I Cried Like The Most Outta My Entire Life... But Tat Doesn't Mean I'm Sad Always.. There Were Happy Tears Too.. Perhaps I'm Jus Too Low On Spirit And On Mood.. But Then It All Turned Out To Be Better.. She Called Me And We Talked On The Phone More.. And In No Time We MADE UP !!!! YEAHHHHHHHHHHH My Whole World Seems To Be So Bright !!! There's Sunshine In Every Little Corner Of Me.. Hehehehehehe.. I'm Over The Moon.. Nothing Means More To Me Than  Forgiveness.. I'll Be Goin' Over To Her Place To Meet Her.. Happily I Went Over.. She Even Cook Noodles For Me.. I'm Tellin' You.. I Was So Freakin' HAPPY !!!!!!!!! After Which I Sent Her To Work.. We Talked Along The Way.. And Things Were Back To Normal... Perhaps Even Better.. I Feel Tat.. After Every Arguement Or Watever.. It'll Only Bond Us Closer And Enhanced The Relationship Stronger.. I Love Her More Then Ever.. So After Sendin' Her To Work I Proceeded Down To MuChuan For My Guitar PRactice.. But Little Did I Know Tat I Was Needed In A Performace @ NUS For A Event Called "Sing Out Loud By Youth Development Board" So I Was Dragged And Begged There To Help Out.. I Was PRomised To Be Released By 930 So Tat I Could Take A Cab Down To Fetch Her After Work But By Audience Request.. They Extended The Performace Till 10pm !! GOD I Really Need To Pick Her Up.. Cos I Promised HEr.. I Was So Worried !!! My Heart Was Poundin' Fast... I'm So Afraid.. So Afraid She'll Be Angry And Pist @ Me Again.. Not After A Made Up I Told Myself.. It's Gonna Make Things Worse.. I'm Really So Frighten.. She Called Me And From Her Tone I Know Tat's It.. She's Not Pleased.. And By The SMS She Sent Me Too.. My Heart Almost Popped Out...So My Friend Sent Me Over To PARKMALL But IT's Too Late Ler.. By The Time I Reach There IT's Already 1045pm Ler.. Luckily She's Not As Pist.. We Made Up Again And I Was @ Ease... My Heart Was Still Poundin' Due To The Fright And My Palms Was Sweaty And Cold... Told Her We Needa Talk.. So After Sendin' Her Back To Tampines We Went To The Pineapple Playground To Talk Things Out Till Late.. Around 2am Or So.. We Felt So Much Better After The Talk.. And It Brought Us Closer Once Again... I Realised Tat I Could Never Live Without Her.. So Sweetie.. I've Made Promises To You Never To Leave You And To Love You And You Alone Always.... You'll Always Be The One I Love And I Truely Do.. I Love You Sweetie.. More Than Anything Else In This World.. Again I Promise You Tat.. :)))))))

      Aug 20th Wed.. Today Is The Day Where We’re Suppose To Meet Up And Have Dinner @ Spoon Soup After Her Driving And Before Her Work Starts @ 7pm But Not Everything Is Goin’ As Smoothly As Planned.. And Yes.. Things Do Happened Suddenly.. Like When She Msg Me To Cancel Off The Dinner Date.. I Was So Lookin’ Forward In Meetin’ Her And Sendin’ Her Off To Work But Alas.. She Wanna Go Back Home And Study For Her SUP Paper This Commin’ Fri. (Her MR Lorrr..  Stupid KELVIN!!!! Hee ;PpPppPpp) So She Decided Not To Work For The Day And Head Home Straight After Drivin’.. Sigh Wat To Do ?? Her Studies Are Definitely More Important.. Hee.. Although Disappointed But I Do Understand So I’ve Decided To Work Till 9pm Tat Day. Mood Abit The Off Ler Sighh.. The Feeling Of Wantin’ To See Her Is So Intensively Strong Words Can’t Describe ‘Em.. All Of A Sudden A Call Came In Through My HP.. And It’s Her House No.. :DDDDD Answered It And To My Surprise She’s Actually Tellin’ Me Tat Her Mom’s Invitin’ Me Over For Dinner !!! ‘Cos They Cooked A lot Of Curry Vegetables !! Ehehehehe Sounds Yummy.. If Tat’s The Case It’s Gonna Be My 1st Offcial Meetin’ With Her Mom.. :DDDDDDD Wahhhh Very Very The Gan Cheong ( Excited ) Lehhhhhh.. LOLLLL How Lydat ??? Errr.rr..r So Tat’s It.. I’ve Made Up My Mind To Pack Up Earlier So I Wouldn’t Be Troublin’ Or Disturbin’ Her Family.. Reached Her Place @  Around 815 ?? Was Greeted By A Very Familiar Face.. Tat’s My Sweetie OF COURSE!!! Hehehehehe.. Greeted Her Mom And Dad Before She Made Me A Bowl Of Curry Veg. Noodles !! Arghhh Fattenin’ Lehhh LOLLLL Eat & Eat Will Grow Fat & Fat Oneeeee Arghh Must Go Runnin’ Ler !!! :DDD So I Sat In Her Livin’ Room To Have My Dinner While Her Dad Is Wactchin’ “WHO WANS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE” Chinese Ver. On TV And Her Mom Ironin’ The Clothes.. She’s Busy Arrangin’ Her Name Cards Were Chattin’ Away Before Zin Got Home.. Shenny Ask Me To Do Some Stuffs For Her.. Eehehehehe No Wonder She Sound So Excited Over The Phone When I Called Her Place.. Was Helpin’ Shenny Slovin’ Some Science Question She Had To Do For Her Assisnments And Posin’ Her Newly Scanned Baby Photo Onto Her MSN Messenger.. Hahaha Saw Some Pass Photos Of My Sweetie In Shenny’s Photo Album.. LOLLL She’s Fightin’ Hard Not To Let Me Lay My Eyes On ‘Em.. But Tat’s Nothing.. I Dun Care How She Looks Like.. I Love Her For Who/Wat She Is.. And No Matter Wat She Becomes.. She Can Always Count On Me To Be There For Her.. ‘Cos She’s The One I Love.. ;PppPppPPppPppp.. So After Doin’ The Scannin’.. I Took A Look @ The Printer Cause She Said It’s Spoilt !!! 2 Of The Rollers Actually Came Off.. Hehehe And She’s Complaining Tat It’s All Zing’s FAULT !!!! Kakkakaka And Zing Denied.. (Of Course) So I Asked From Her Dad For Some Tools Which I Could Use On Fixin’ The Printer.. But Apprently There’s Not Enuff Tools To Use And I Can’t Open The Cover Of The Printer Exposin’ The Fault Within’ So I Guess I’ve Gotta Bring The Whole Printer Back Home And Repair.. And Upon Hearin’ Tat Zing Comment “ It’s So Good To Have A BF.. Everything Also Can Do” Hehehehehehe

      Aug 19th Tues.. Received A SMS Msg From Her Durin’ Work Sayin’ She’s Feeling Sick.. Havin’ Headaches and Coughin’ Plus She’s Super Sleepy In Class.. I Can Tell That She’s Tired Because Of The SMS She Sent Me.. All Her Words Are All Jumbled Up.. For E.g.. “I’m CHAO Sian!!” Became “I’m CHAN Sian!!” And “I Cannot Keep Myself AWAKE Ler…”  To “I Cannot Keep Myself CYCLE Ler…” Hahahaha I Was Smilin’ To Myself After I Read the SMS.. Hee But Then After Readin’ That I Was All Worried And Felt Her Agony Tat She’s Goin’ Through @ The Exact Moment So I’ve Decided To Pick Her Up After Her Lessons.. Took The Train From Tampines Down All The Way To Outram To Switch To The North East Line To Harbor Front Before Takin’ A Bus Down To MIS.. But I Was So Tired I Fell Asleep On The Train And Overshot 3 Stations After Outram Hahahaha Got Off Immediately And Board The Other Headin’ Back To Outram Again.. Ehehehe Silly Me Right?? And So Finally I Reached MIS.. Intended To Give Her A Surprise So I Hid @ The Bus Stop As The Time Is Still Early (Her Lessons Fin. @ 10pm And I’m Early.. Reached By 920pm) Took A Leak @ The Toilet Before Proceedin’ To Wait @ The Bus Stop.. Hehehehe And By 1010 There She Was Walkin’ Out With Her Friend SiLing.. I Din’t Expect Her To Spot Me Lehhh But She’s Sharp.. Was Lookin’ Around For Me Once She Stepped Out From The Gate !!!! Hahahaha I’ve Got Nowhere To Hide Ler..So I Walked Up Her And She Kept On Tellin’ Me.. “I Knew It!! I Knew You’ll Come One.. I Jus Got This Hunch !! My 6th Sense Kept Tellin’ Me You’ll Come.. Hahahaha And You Really Come!!”  Hee I Jus Smiled And We Walked To The Bus Stop.. On The Way She Said She Almost Had An Asthma Attack!!! Gosh I Was So Worried!! But Luckily She’s Alright But Still She’ll Be Coughin’ Here And Then..@ The Bus Stop We Bumped Into KELVIN!! Gr.r.r.r.r The QIAN DU JUI REN !!! I Could Jus Twist Tat Bugger’s Head Off LOLLLLL Aiya But It’s All Over Ler.. So We Jus Chatted For Awhile Before Boardin’ Bus 30.. Sat @ The Back Of The Bus And Chatted Away.. Ehehehe Suan Her Abit Bout The SMS She Sent Me LOLLL Actually It’s Jus To Cheer Her Up. =))))))) Switched Our Seats Twice As It’s Getting’ Hot And Stuffy Generated By The Bus’s Engine. She Rested On My Shoulders And I Tried To Nap Awhile.. Really Super Tired Also.. Hehehe.. Alighted @ Bedok Bus Interchange And Switched To Bus 69, Which’ll Bring Us, Back To Her Place.. Finally We Reached Her Doorstep.. Sighh.. Such A Fast Journey.. I Haven’t Got Enuff Time Spent With Her.. I Know I’m Gonna Miss Her A Great Deal.. She Forgot To Bring Her Keys So Mommy Opened The Door For Her.. Greeted Her Mom.. Her Mom Doesn’t Seemed Too Happy When She Saw Me Sendin’ Her Back.. But After I Asked Whether She’s Feelin’ Better She Opened Up And Even Offered Me Homemade BARLEY Water !!! Ehehehe And Even Asked Me To Go In & Take A Sit!! Hee Finally I Can Go Into Her Place GUAN MING ZHE DA-ly!!! Hehehehehe Greeted Her Dad Too.. And As It Was Getting Later I Left Shortly After I Fin. The Drink.. Kissed Her Goodnight After She Passed Me Her Ibook And So This Is The First Time I’m Using Her Ibook..Hehehehe Quite Excited Leh Hhahaha How Lydat Wor ?? ‘Cos She Said Now Tat My Brother Is Back From Uk..

      Oct 10th Fri... Went To Work With A Heavy Heart Along With Heavy Eyes.. The Whole Day My Mind Was On Her... Was Shoppin' Alone Before Work And I Spotted This SIGG™ Bottle Which She Likes Alot..Without Thinkin' I Got It On The Spot And The Very NExt Thing Tat's On My Mind Was Right After Work Today I'll Go To Her Place And Appologize To Her...And All Went Accordin' To Plan.. And By Right She Should Be @ Home.. But When I Return Back To My Office @ Boat Quay My Colleagues Suggested Us To Go For A Drink @ The Newly Opened COYOTE UGLY.. Feeling All Moody And Low In Spirit I Decided To Get A Few Drinks Before Headin' Down To HEr Place.. And Jus As I Thought I Had Enuff And Should Be On My Way To Her Place..She Flashes Passed Right Infront Of Me !!!! OH MY GODDD !! And She Jus Walked Away From Me!!! DAMNNN Do You Know How My Heart Felt Like ?????????? She's The Least Person I'm Expected To See There.. Without Another Word I Jus Gave Chase After HEr All The Way Out When I Finally Managed To Hold Her Back.. I Wanted To Talk Things Out But She Jus Can't Be Bothered!!!! "Jus Leave Me Alone Lah!!" Was Wat She Shot @ Me.. I Was Deverstated...Really Really Cutted Deep.. I Bursted...Screamed...I Jus Couldn't Take It Anymore.. I've Gotta Let It Out.. She Turned And Walked Away... I Was Dropped In Hell...I Punched The Wall.. I Couldn't Feel Pain No More..... No Amount Of Pain Can Compare With How My Heart Felt.. I Walked Back Into COYOTE UGLY And Fin. A Bottle Of JACK DANIELS... The Only Thoughts In My Mind Was "Get Drunk..Get Drunk And All The Pain Will Go Away..." But Jus Split Seconds After Tat... She's All I Can Think Off.. I Dashed Out To Look For Her Again.. Runnin' Down The Lane She Took.. But She's Gone.. I Panicked !!!! I Went Berserk !!!! Runnin' Around Like A Mad Man.. Goin' Into Any Lanes I Can Lay My Eyes On... I Ran All The Way To Raffles MRT....But In Vain.. Still No Sight Of Her.. I Ran Back To BoatQuay.. And Go Into Any Pubs Or Clubs Tat's On My Way... I Kept Callin' Her On My Cellphone.. 10 Times.. 20 Times.. No Answer... I Went Mad Again.. No Longer Could I Hold My Tears Any Longer... A Very Strong Sense Of Loss Came Up In Me... I'm Loss.. So Loss.. I Ran To The Bus Stop Also.. I Combed The Whole Of BoatQuay.. I Jus Couldn't Find HEr.. No Ans From Her Phone.. I Began To Wander Up & Down The Street....And Finally She Picked Up My Call... I Pled Her To Meet Me.. To Come Out WhereEver She's Hidin'... And Finally There She Was.. Emergin' From A Pub... More Tears Flow Out... I Jus Simply Couldn't Hold Myself Back Anymore.. I Hit The Wall Again.. I Let Everything Out.. My Feelings.. My Sorrows.. My Apologies...How Much I Can't Live Without HEr.. How Deep And True I To Her... I Hugged Her Like I've Never Hugged Before...So Tight....I'm So Afraid I'll Lose Her... I Jus Love Her So Much... Jus SO MUCH..

      Ok I Did A Revamp To The Webbie.. I Jus Wanna Keep This Webbie Simple And Nice.. Why ?? Because My Love For My Sweetie Is Simple &amp; True.. And Tat's All I Need.. I Don't Need No Soficaicated Designs Or URLs To Declare My Love OUT LOUD To My Love... I'll Jus Keep This Love For Her Deep Inside My Heart.. To Cherish To Love To Care To Trust To Bloom... But @ This Very Moment.. My Sweetie Is Far Far Away In Frankfurt.. Maybe The Reason Of Not Bloggin' As Often When She's Away Is I'm Afraid I'll Get Too Upset.. I Don't Wanna Be Reminded Tat Someone So Important So Dear To Me Is NOT With My When I Needed Her Most.. When I Wanna Hold Someone's Hand.. Her's Are Not Here.. When I Wanna Hold Someone So Dear To Close.. She's Not Here.. When I Wanna Kiss Those Special Lips So Passionately.. Where Is She ?? I Can't Take It For Long.. I Need My Love To Be With Me All The Time.. I WAN MY SWEETIE MAHHHHHH I WAN MAH I WAN MAH I WAN MAH !!! Where Are You Sweetie ?? Where Oh Where Is This True Love Of Mine ??? :~~~~ I Miss You So So Much Can You Sense It Even Over In Frankfrut??? *SnIfZ* I LOVE YOU MAH!!
