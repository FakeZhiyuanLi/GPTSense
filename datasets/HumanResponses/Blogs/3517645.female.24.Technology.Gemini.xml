      These last two nights at work have been crazy busy for me and Keenan. We are trying to keep up with one of our students who keeps emails us like 10 or more times a night with questions on SQL Server. The only good thing about it is that it keeps up busy and time goes by really quick. I can't wait to go on vacation. I really feel like I need to get away. Maybe my stress level will go down.  Well I booked our hotels tonight for Ontario. We are going to stay one night in Niagara Falls and two nights in Mississauaga. I got some good deals on expedia. I was looking a couple weeks ago at one hotel that was really nice and was on sale for $80 a night, but I book to late and the sale is over, so I had to go with a different hotel. It is still nice. After Madison's appointment we are going to go to my cousin Patti's house in Aurora to stay there for two nights and go to Wonderland with her family, then we are off to Peterborough of a night to see some friends from high school. I am looking forward to going there, but I'm not too. Just because of everything that happened there when Duane lived their and went to school. I will save that story for another post.   I am going to go for a run in the morning. I was looking in the mirror the other day when I was wearing shorts and god my legs are getting awful looking. I need to lose some weight really bad, but it is so hard. I lose 10 put 10 back on and it just keeps going.

      Well my weekend didn't go to bad. I went up the camp Friday night and stay until Sunday morning. I arrive back in Fredericton around 2 and duane's parents still hadn't arrived. I did some weeding in the garden and got ready to go out with them. The camp was great. We went to the beach. The kids love playing in the sand and building stuff well I laid out an got a tan. Harley was really good when we were down the beach unlike last time when he kept trying to sneak off over to the other camp to see the dog that was there. Harley loves the water. We through sticks for him and sometimes he just wades around. Everyone was up there and the kids had a great time going to visit everyone.   On Sunday night we went swimming at the hotel and then had supper with duane's parents. It was ok, but I could have been doing other things around the house, like cleaning up.   I went to the dentist on Monday, she said I had beautiful teeth and then hung out with duane's parents at the mall. The bought the kids some new sandals and sneakers. Which saved me some money.

      Well I over reacted in my post yesterday. When I got home Duane had almost finish painting the kitchen and today he is suppose to put everything back in the cupboards. So I guess that I one less thing that I have to worry about now. I do apologize.   Well I had my weekend all planned out and then they called. They being Duane's parents. They want to come up and see the kids. I had plans with the kids to go to mom's camp for the weekend because Duane is working. But no they want to come up on Sunday and get a hotel so the kids can swim indoors at a pool instead of enjoying the beautiful weekend that it is suppose to be. His mom won't come to our house because of the dog. We have lived in the house for almost a year now and she had only visited twice, once when we moved in, and they stayed at a hotel, and this was before he got the dog, and they said Christmas eve night at the house and left at 9:30 on Christmas morning. They also came to Fredericton on other time and didn't even come to the house at all. Oh Dave, duane's dad came up for Madison birthday party and she mom just conveniently took a shift at work on the same day so she didn't have to come. It makes me feel like our home is not good enough for them to come and spend time with us there we either have to go to their home in saint john or meet them somewheres in Fredericton. All well, I guess it is less time that we will spend with them. I guess that was another rant for the day.   Well we are still going to go to the camp on Saturday and come home Sunday afternoon and meet up with duane's parents, thank god he is off work at 5.

      Well here is my rant for the day.   Duane has had the last two days off from work, his scheduled two days a week and he has not done a damn thing around the house. The basement is a total right off. I mean there is still christmas stuff out in the hall waiting to go in the storage room on in the garbage. I have attempt to put all this stuff away, but when I am off for my four days I have to clean up stairs cause god forbid he could actually take a dirty dish from the living room into the kitchen or pick up a piece of paper or swipe the floor well I am working for my four days 12 hour shifts. On my four days off, I do laundry clean the living room do dishes, try and finish the kitchen that I have been trying to paint for a month now but can't get finish because the kitchen is consently a mess from him trying to cook stuff and leaving stuff all over the place. I get groceries mow the lawn clean the yard take care of the kids and the dog, oh the list goes on. Yes I do have a nap in the afternoon and some days I just get so frustrated that I don't do anything. Why can't he just do something anything. It just gets so frustrating when I take my days off and clean and clean and then go to work for four days and come home and the house is a complete mess again.   Ok I feel a little better, well not really the house still isn't cleaned. :)

      Well today is dad's anniversary. 6 years ago was when he was killed. It only seems like yesterday that he was here. I can't believe it has been so long. He went to work one day and never came home. I will always remember that morning. I awoke earlier to study for an exam I as writing that morning. I noticed smoke out the front of my living room window and then received a phone call from my grandmother asking if dad was working today. I replied yes, why. And she told me that there was an explosion at the refinery. I instantly knew something was wrong. Duane showed up to pick me and Madison. My dads parents were suppose to watch Madison well I wrote my exam and we were dropping her off. I expressed my concern to him and told him I had to leave and go to see what happened. He kept reassuring me that no one was hurt as that is what the radio was stating, however I knew deep down that that was not true and I found out I was right as soon as we drove into my grandparent hacketts yard. My cousin and uncle, who works with dad, were there. My cousin broke the news to me. It was horrible. I will never ever for get the feeling that I experienced that morning as soon as I seen the smoke and knew it was from the refinery.  Questions we ask, and still no reply  One's like "what if", "how come" and "why"  But time nor words could ease the pain Because each year on this day We re-live it again A thousand tears and more we shed,  A thousand words, left unsaid  All of a sudden you were taken away  And nothing could've prepared us for that day.  Deeply missed, day and night,  Always in our hearts,  only gone from our sight.  Love you always dad.

      It is now a count down to our trip to Toronto. My daughter has an appointment there to see her doctor for her Brachial Plexus. If you are unaware of exact what it is the five nerves that run from your shoulder down to your fingers that do not function properly because of different problems. My daughter's nerves (3 of them) were severed and two were stretched when she was born. She was 11lbs and her shoulders ended up getting stuck. She stopped breathing so the doctor just pulled her out as it was either this or she would not be alive. She had surgery when she was 6 months old to repair the damaged nerves, but all of her motor function has not and will not return. She is doing great though. We use to go every year to see her doctor in Toronto, but two years ago he decided he was not going to do anymore surgery unless a new technology or something came about. So we are going every two years for assessments. He is a great doctor.   We are leaving on June 26 and returning on July4th, maybe earlier if we run out of money. The kids are excited and what to do everything well we are there. Go to Canada's Wonderland, the zoo, stop at Niagara falls, and go to maybe a water park or something. I just find everything so expensive there. Here it is free to do most things or it cost very little.   17 days.

      Well it has been a couple days since my last post. I have been a little busy. Dylans party went great on Sunday. He got to see his bestfriend meagan, who he hasn't seen in a while. Her mom use to babysit him and Madison, but she had a baby and can't watch them anymore. He was so excited when he seen her. It made my whole day just to see the look on his face when he seen her. I told Jen, her mom, that we would have to get together over the summer and take the kids to the pool or something. The kids played in the playclimber and play a whole bunch of games. After the party Madison had to going bowling with her sparks group at the same place as dylan's party so that was cool. We went for supper while she bowled and then came back and bowled a string well we waited for her to finish.   On Monday Dylan and I met Madison's class at the Clay cafe. It is a place were you go to paint pottrey. Dylan I think expected something more cause when we left he said he didn't have any fun all he did was paint. lol. When Duane got home from work we went to the soccer field to get the kids their soccer shirts. duane is coaching both of their soccer teams, Dylan's team is the kangaroos and Madison's is the Pythons. The play ever monday night in Douglas. After that we went to DQ for some ice cream and some misty's. The kids love those.   On sunday our new babysitter called and said her grandmother died. I felt so bad for her. All she kept saying is how bad she felt for not being able to babysit. I told her not to worry about and to go be with her family. So she couldn't watch the kids on tuesday, today. I had to call Nevin, my teamleader and tell him I couldn't work on tuesday. I don't think he was too happy about it but there was nothing else I could do. so my team in going without an Oracle person today because Darlene's husband is in the hospital with a compressed disk in his back and can't move so she isn't working at the moment either. But I said I would be on call all day to work from home.

      I went to my mom's camp last night and stayed all day today. The kids and I had a blast. So did the dog. We spent most of the day today at the beach. The dog loves going after sticks in the water, but you have to watch him cause he tries to sneek off. He thinks he is tricky but he isn't.   Mom was telling me that there is a monument in Ottawa that has placks for everyone whos has been killed on the job and that she wants to go up and see it. I think I might mention it to Duane and see if you wants to stop on our way home from toronto. I would love to his it as well. There is one there for dad.   Dylan party is tomorrow. I have to remember to stop at toys r us to pick up his party bags for the other kids.

      Well last night when I got home I when I got home from work I decided to cook some fiddleheads for supper. So I put them in a pot of water on the stove and let them boil. When they were done I used the pot holder to take them off the stove and drained them in the sink. I then decided to put them back into the pot, I have no idea why so I grabbed the pot handle, without the pot holder, and needless to say I got a 2nd degree burn on my index finger and middle finger. It hurt like hell. Duane wasn't' home so I called him at work to find out what I should do. He told me he would talk to the pharmaists about it and call me back. He calls me back and tells me to put my hand in cold water and it should feel better and to use ointment after with a bandage. Fine, I put my hand in water, it isn't feeling any better my whole hand is burning and feels like it is on fire. I can't go to the hospital because I have the kids at home with me. So Duane finally gets home and yells at me for being a whiner and that it can't hurt that bad. Anyways I get him to put the bandage on and he ends up grabbing my finger and squeezing it I flipped out. He was like what's your problem, blah blah. He was a total jerk about the whole ordeal. Well at 11 I ended up going to the hospital. I just couldn't stand the pain anymore. They wrapped it up for me and gave me some tylenol 3's to take home. Well it feels better today thank god.  Me and the kids are heading up to mom's camp for the weekend. It is finally suppose to be nice. Although today is quite windy. I have to take my car in to have it looked over and get inspected before we head out on our trip to Ontario in three weeks. Hopefully everything is going to be fine.   off to take a shower.

      Finally day 4 and it is finally going to be a nice weekend.  After work yesterday we went to see the movie Shrek 2. It was great. The kids didn't get a lot of the funny parts but they still loved it. Dylan would just laugh because everyone else in the theatre was laughing. It was cute. When we got home I noticed that Duane did actually paint some of the kitchen and he did some laundry, I was amazed, however the living room was twice as messy then it was in the morning before I left for work and he left food at and the dog go into it and made a mess all over the couch. It is weird no matter how much he does around the house I still always find something to point out to him that he didn't do right, one he left the paint can open and two he missed some places when he was painting like behind the frig and stove. So I just went to bed.   I got up late for work, 6:10. I am usually at work by 6:30. I jumped in the shower really quick, go dressed put the dog out and ran out the door. What a great way to start the day. Even though I went to bed at 10, I am still extremely tired. You ever wake up and just know it is going to be one of those days.   God I hope today goes by fast.

      I am feeling tired and worn today. Day shift really kills me. I am not a morning person and don't think I ever will be. Even when the kids were babies they would wake up early, but as soon as they ate we all went back to sleep. Usually around noon my mind will start to function properly. Two days to go then I can rest have hopefully finish my kitchen. God knows Duane will not finish like he is suppose to today. He said he was going to do it yesterday, but it seems he never gets around to doing anything cause he said he would do the kitchen on Tuesday and mow the lawn on Wednesday, but we all know the lawn will definitely not get done today and I will end up doing it tomorrow night when I get off work.   The kids were good last night. I think they had a hard day like me yesterday at the babysitters. I must get Duane to talk to the school today regarding the bus though, they keep forgetting to drop her off at the babysitters when she is suppose to go there. Duane sends a note to the school so they should be able to keep things straight. That god it is almost done for the summer. We all went to bed quite early after we had a good laugh at the bad singers on Canadian Idol. Go I can't believe some of those people think they are actually good singers. I think some just do it to get on TV.   well until later.....

      Hey everyone who reads this. I just discovered the wonderful world of blogs. This is interested cause I don't usually express my feelings at all. I grew up in a family where you kept everything inside. Even when my father was killed, my mother and I didn't even share a hug. I look back now after 6 years and realize how strange that was. Now that I have kids, I make sure they know that I love them and share hugs and kiss every day to show that I care. I don't want them to grow up in a house like I did, cold and quiet.   Ah the kids. How great are they, 6 and 5 next week. They keep me on my toes and keep me smiling everyday. It is his birthday next week going to have a party with some of his friends.   Well work is calling again. Until next time

       Well since my last post I have gone to the gym twice and have been bringing my lunch to work everyday, third day in a row. I think I have been able to do it cause at the moment I have like $8 to my name, which means I can't take any money out of the bank machine, the stupid things only give out $20's. But I have eaten a lot healthier and have been tracking everything. So far 2lbs have disappeared, I am sure I will find them sometime. :)     &nbsp;   I had two awful sleeps this week. Duane was off for two days and home with the kids all day. I told him not to ever take any days off when I was working nights again. I probably had like 4 or 5 hours sleep those two days he was off. He was constantly yelling at the kids or the kids were playing really load or the they would get the dog going and he would bark. So today I had a great sleep. Just me and the dog. I got home from the gym at 8 and fell a sleep on the couch for an hour or so and then moved to the bed. I woke up once to let the dog in the house and then didn't wake up again until 5:45. It was great.     &nbsp;

      Well it is that time. I need to loss some weight.&nbsp; Ever since I had Madison, I have been unable to get back to my original size of 130lbs, which is my ideal weight for my height. I start going to the gym last week on my way home from work and getting up and doing things around the house and with the kids, like swimming and going for walks.&nbsp; I don't mind doing any of these things. I quite enjoy them. The worst part about the whole thing is trying to eat correctly, or better yet change my eating habits.&nbsp; I don't want to diet because they never work and you always end up gaining back the weight. It must be a gradual change of eating habits. I love to cook, but don't have time. Fast food fits into our lifestyle way to easy. Tonight was my first night that I brought my lunch and am going to gradually try and bring my lunch more and more each week and only eat out like twice. So my mission is to loss 35lbs, go to the gym at least 4 times a week and to minimize my eating out for now.

      Well I passed my exam on Friday thank god. There was so much pressure for me to pass, with nevin giving me a raise and all. So I passed. Another one behind me.   Friday night we went down to saint john and went to a free concert on the board walk. It was cold and foggy as usually in Saint John, but the music was good. It was Nathan Wiley who opened for Matt Mays. It was pretty good. Duane and I set at Keystone's with Aimee and Scott and had some drinks.   On Saturday we all went to Moncton for the night. It rained all day Saturday which ruined our plans. We were going to go to parlee beach or magic mountain. Instead we just hung out and went to the driving range (well it didn't rain) and the went to the mall. We had some lunch to, so that took up some time. We all went to the club that night and got totally loaded then Aimee and Scott go into a fight and left at like 12:30 or 1, can't remember. We tried to help them sort it out but decided it was best if they did it on their own. Duane and I went back to the club and had a great time dancing and stuff. I won some free drinks and some $1 off coupons for the club. So it was all cool. Duane and I went on the go carts on Sunday and to costco then we all headed home. Scott wasn't feeling good and was cranky so we didn't do much. I guess they finally got everything sorted out on Sunday after they got home. Aimee emailed me and apologized for Scott being such an ass. Duane and I had fun anyways so it wasn't a big deal.&nbsp;   Well it was back to work tonight, for 4 nights.&nbsp; Fun fun, more test prep to develop.

      Well l my aunt and uncle were a no show today. They said they were going to be over around 2:30, so I got up (I am currently working the night shift) at 1:30 and went and got the kids at the babysitters and then waited. At around 3:45 they called and said they were running late and won't be able to make it. Well isn't that lovely. The only good thing about it is I now have a clean house for a day or two. I then had to take the kids back to the babysitters so I could go to work. Duane didn't get off until 7 tonight. So it was basically a waste of a day. If they had of called earlier I would have been able to take the kids right back to the babysitters and got another hours sleep. I can just tell tonight is going to be fun. I am so tired.   On a good note, mom is taking the kids for the weekend and Duane and I are going to moncton with one of my old best friends from high school and her boyfriend whom we worked with at Mcdonalds. This is the first time is like a year that we are going to get to go out and not have to worry about the kids. We are going to have so much fun. We are going to go out on Saturday night and hang out at the beach or go to magic mountain and of course shop.   Tonight is night 4 and I have to do some major studying tonight. My exam is Friday morning. God I hope I get this exam. There is a lot of pressure which sucks, plus I just got a raise last night and now I know I can't disappoint the boss.   see later alligator  Melissa

      My uncle and aunt are visiting from Ontario for a month. My aunt called me tonight at work and asked me for directions to my house cause they are going to come and visit tomorrow, which is great cause I haven't seen them in about two years. So I called Duane and asked him to clean up the house and told him they were coming. Well he got all pissed off cause he had to clean. Our house is a complete right off when I am working, I believe I have gone through this topic before. all I can say is thank god I got the kids rooms cleaned and our room cleaned on the weekend. at least I don't have to worry about them. I just need the living room and kitchen cleaned.   I also have one other worry. Our dog, harley, has never been around other dogs. The only time he sees them is when we are out on walks, and he freaks out at them, but his tail is always wagging. My aunt and uncle have the same kind of dog as us, rottweiler, which is their baby so I know they are going to bring her tomorrow as well. I am worried about how Harley is going to interact with her. I really hope he does not try anything. I will keep you all posted on how we make out.  &nbsp;

      At work we are required to complete 8 certification exams a year. We are now half way through the work year (our company year starts in febuary) and I have only completed 2 exams. This is due to the fast that we are running out of certification exams to write. We are only allowed to have so many people per team to have certain exams, for example there can only be 4 people on a team that are MCSE certified. This Friday I will be attempting for my third exam for the year. It is a new Microsoft Security exam. I am not very confident that I am going to pass, the only reason I am writing it after studying for only two weeks, although I have had 8 weeks, is because my boss insists that I take it because I am past my due date. Even though I went on vacation and only got back two weeks ago. And of course I am not going to and should be expected to study well I am on vacation, that is what it is for to get away from it all. Anyways I am not sure what this rant is about, I guess I am just tired and bored. And do not want to write this exam and have another fail on my record.

      Well I haven't posted in a while and thought I would start back up again.  &nbsp;  We went to Toronto and had a great time. Of course my mom ended up going, but we only spent two days with her. God we just can't go anywhere or do anything without one of our family's tagging along. Don't get me wrong I love them and everything, but it is like we are still kids and can't go anywhere alone.  &nbsp;  We did the whole tourist thing starting in Niagara falls and then going into Toronto. We went to the playdium ( a big arcade), CN Tower, Canada's Wonderland, the Zoo. We also visited with my cousins for two nights and just relaxed and then headed to Peterborough to visit a friend from high school and his girlfriend. Madison had her appointment on Wednesday. It went well. Everything is going as expected. She basically has back all the movement she is going to get with her arm and hand. She can still get stronger as she uses it more. As she gets older she is learning to figure out how to complete more and more with her right arm and hand. The doctor did say there is a surgery that could be done, however it will not help her function at all but it would rather be just for appearance and place her arm in a neutral position and she would look "normal". So that is a decision that we will have to think about. Next year when we go we are going to meet with the surgeon that would do the surgery and see what he has to say about it and get all the information.  &nbsp;  The kids had a blast during the trip and it was a really quick and tiring week, but we fit everything in and we were glad to be home to have a good nights sleep. That is our trip in a nutshell.

      Well I am back to work again after my lovely 4 days off. On Saturday we went to saint john for a family get together. It was fun. Got to see some of my cousins that I haven't seen in awhile and just hung out. On Saturday night we went out to the bars with two of my cousins, my uncle, and sister. It was a fun night, we all got caught up on what we are doing. We, duane and I, also ran into some friends of ours from high school when we were on our way home.  On Sunday duane called in sick cause he wanted to spend the day with his mom. We took her shopping and she bought the kids there school clothes and sneakers, that was a great help, now I dont have the expensive of that but only there school supplies.  Speaking of school supplies it is insane the stuff that the teachers ask for us to buy for them for school, it basically gets right down to the color and brand of the books, pencils, markers, and everything else. Also the number of items they need is crazy.  I have been told by other parents that it is because they give the supplies to other students in the class they may have purchased the incorrect supplies or wrong brand. So I started only sending one of each set. like one set of markers and one set of pencil crayons, then when they need more I can give them to them to take.  Duane and I both had Tuesday off, so we took the kids out for some brunch and then to the Mactaque beach. It was a fun day. We took them to see spiderman 2 in the evening. They loved it. It was a really great movie, excellent all around.  Well back to work for another 2 days, gives me some time to study for my next exam. oh so fun.

      Well it is finally day 4. I just have to make it through the day, then I get a lovely 4 days to rest.  I took Harley for a walk last night, well half jog and well we were on our adventure a dog came running and barking at us from one of the homes along the road. Harley and him sniffed each other for a moment, than the little dog turn a bit at him. I was like holy jus Harley please don't do anything and he didn't I was so happy. I managed to get him moving again down the road. There was also another dog across the street, an older german shepard, that was watching the whole thing. He must of thought the little dog was crazy.  Duane was off all day yesterday and didn't accomplish much but spend money as usual. He was suppose to get up early and go and get a part to fix the lawn mower so the lawn could be done. It has been like two weeks since it was done, but he didn't. We finally went to Canadian tire at like 9 to get the part and it was fixed by 9:30, but it was to late to mow the lawn. Now he is back to work today, which means I will have to do it when I get home. well it will be a good workout for me anyways. It just takes so bloody long, 2hours, to mow it.  well that is all for today. I might post later if I get bored at work.

      Ah! The week is almost over finally. These days are just dragging on and on and on.....  I hate day shift. I believe I have mentioned this before. No matter how early I go to bed I am still extremely tired in the morning. The last two nights I have gone to bed at 10 and gotten up at 6. That is 8 hours sleep, which is not enough for me. I need at least 10 hours to be fully regenerated. But I just can't justify going to bed as soon as I get home from work. I need to spend sometime with the kids as some point. I just wish I work nights all the time, then my sleep does not lack.  After I got home from work last night we took the kids for a walk on the green and then stopped at the wilmont park outdoor wading pool for a minute.  It is mom's birthday tomorrow. I am still now sure what I am going to get her. She has everything. I might get the kids to make her something. Maybe I will take them to get a craft or something at the craft store. I won't see her until Saturday.

      Well it is day two and I am just as tired as I was yesterday even though I went to bed at 10pm. I tried to stay up to watch the Amazing Race, which comes on at 11pm, but there was a thunderstorm and the rain was insane, which made our satillite go out of wack so we couldn't get a signal anyways. so off to bed I went. I had a good sleep until about 1am, then the kids both came in and it was all down hill from there. I am sure they had a great sleep all cuddied between duane and I. The lightening last night was pretty cool, especially when I drove across the bridge to get home from work. I love thunder and lightening storms. In saint john we hardly ever got them, but here in fredericton at least once a week you see lightening.   I am now studying for my next exam. Only three more and then I get a bonus, whoo. But what sucks about getting the bonus it that the government takes almost half before I even see it. which is crazy cause I have to work hard for that bonus. all well that is the way it works and we can't do much about it.

      Well it was back to work for me today. It was a nice longweekend. We went to the camp on Saturday morning and come home last night. My aunt and uncle were there with their dog Ares. My aunt's sister came to visit for a night with her two kids, so my kids had some other kids to play with, so they were happy. we spend quite a bit of time at the beach. Harley came with us too. He had a great time swimming and stuff. We let him off the leash and he didn't run away like he usually does, we think it was because the other dog was there so he was being good. exceptional good.  My eating good is going ok, I did have a couple sweets and things on the weekend, but that is expected every once in awhile. I haven't been to the gym since friday morning and am not sure when I am going to get back, now that I am on day shift. After work I have to go directly to the babysitters and get the kids. Maybe on my days off.  If this post doesnt' make much sense it is because I am extremely tired. to busy of a weekend.
