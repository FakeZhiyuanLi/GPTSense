      Hey!!!!!Its me, Kausalya!!!!Juz typing sumthing to think about...     Today, was pretty hectic but was kinda cool....I woke up all calm and relaxed and came to school for choir...happily...( Choir ROX!!! ) and today was also the 1st working day for our new prez Klara..(sumthing lyk that)... but hey who can forget yesterday...it was time to bid farewell to our dear Sec 4 seniors...[BooHoo!!! :( ]Great food,great performances, great games and loads of fun!!!! But then we came to the end of the event and the floodgates opened up....It was a sorry and joyful sight to look upon the seniors...exchanging gifts and then parting... ...     Today was also the start of the Olympic heats and I can't bear to be torn apart from the Sports Channel...Sooooo many events are taking place...I also saw the opening ceremony with all the countries parading... Ronald Susilo was the flag bearer for Singapore as the Singapore team came marching in...and at the end Bjort sang 'Mother of Humanity' which I, personally think sounded kinda weird cuz she had a funny accent...not to be rude of course....      Today is also VERY memorable because it is my youngest sister's BIRTHDAY...and she's turning 9!!!She's in India so we rang her up to wish her and she sounded really pleased...good for her! But we didn't exactly get her anything...*guiltily looking around*     Well I guess I have to go now...but I will be posting soon so keep a look out! As I sign off now...think about this...     "Where has yesterday gone?"     "Why hasn't God made sardines without bones?'....until next time....
