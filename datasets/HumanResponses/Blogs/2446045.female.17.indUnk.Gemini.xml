      I hate driver's ed so much.  The teacher is an absolute moron.  The first day he asked some girl (in front of the whole class) if she'd ever held hands with a boy.  He pressured her into answering, and when she said yes, he asked if she was nervous when she held his hand.  It was so inappropriate and it made me angry that the girl didn't stand up for herself.  He's the kind of person who likes to argue for the fun of it. (he's told us so himself, as if that's something to be proud of)  He also expects the worse out of us.  He thinks that all teenagers are stupid and have no common sense at all.  Today, he kicked Adrienne Strong out of class for talking.  ADRIENNE STRONG!  My sweet, little, innocent, valedictorian-type sophomore!  I was so pissed off.  Then, two girls from Mags  were talking.  He looked at them for awhile as if he was deciding on what to do with them.  He told them to leave.  Just as they were about to walk out the door, he told them to come back.  ARGGG!!!!!!!!   I was so angry and frustrated with this old fart of a man.  I honestly hate him. GRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At least I only have one day left.

      I wish he would treat me like he used to.  I miss him being the cutest, nicest, funniest guy I know.  I miss how he would always greet me so kindly.  He got me a balloon and brought people to sing for me on my birthday.  He told me I was the hottest girl in the world.  He kissed me on the cheek.  He hugged me.  He gave me constant high fives.  He said he loved my laugh and my smile.  He was all I thought about for 5 months.  What happened to all that?  I want it back.

      Just sitting in my room listening to some music trying to pass the time.  I had the coolest dream last night.  I was in the school play, but was running around backstage trying to remember my next line.  Then, it was time for the curtain call, and it felt so good to be on stage with people cheering for me.  I can't wait for the musical tryouts.  I really think I can do it this year.  I am so restless. If I were a boy I would wear hats.  Not baseball caps, but hats like guys in the 50s would wear.  They used to not leave the house without their hat on.  I would be like that.  I would wear suits all the time, too.  I would be the suavest guy in the neighborhood. I guess I'll clean my room now.  There's no better time like the present.  Fun.

      Yesterday, I was on a quest to spend my Christmas money.  I bought a sweater at the Gap, and some CDs.  I bought a Frank Sinatra CD.  I was so excited.  I like it a lot.  Someone to Watch Over Me is my favorite song ever.  I love it.

      I just got back from Emily's.  It was loads of fun.  We ate food, played games, and talked a lot.  It was good to catch up with her.  It never ceases to amaze me how much we have in common.  It's like we were meant to be.  I miss her. Yesterday, I spent the evening with Abbey, Marge, and Abbey's brother, Jake.  We watched Pirates.  I had fun.  Abbey gave me a Hulk pillowcase for christmas. Both Emily and Abbey got me presents.  I didn't get either of them anything.  I feel like such a bad friend.  Rita and I decided that we wouldn't do Christmas presents because we know that it's stressful to have to shop for other poeple. David can't return his slippers because I bought them on sale.  They don't take returns on sale items at Spencer's.  haha.  He has to keep them.  I thought it was so funny.

      I just realized that I am the only unpaired person in my house.  My parents have eachother.  Matt has Shauna.  David has Julie.  Even my dogs have eachother because we have one boy and one girl.  This sucks. For Christmas, I got Pirates of the Carribbean on DVD, duck slippers that actually quack, jewelry, the Princeton Review AP chemistry book, Taboo (the best game ever), a few other little things, and a total of $181.  I can't wait to go shopping tomorrow! Abbey called today.  She seemed really happy, giddy even.  It was nice to talk to her. Apparently Emily is home now.  I'll have to call her, because I can't wait to see her. TRADING SPACES MARATHON!!!!!!!!!  yay!  all day!  (that rhymed!)

      If someone doesn't believe in God, and therefore, Jesus, do you think they should get Christmas presents?  What do you think?

      David Kulma is the best at everything.  He knows everything ever known.  No one will ever be as good as David is at anything.  Davd Kulma is the only thing that matters and no one should care about anything else. At least that's what David Kulma thinks. Christmas morning is starting off wonderfully........

      Christmas Eve!!!  yay.  Last night I went out with my dad and finished my christmas shopping.  I had no idea what to get David, so I found these slippers at Spencer's.  They are in the shape of The Count from Sesame Street.  They are so cute, and were only $10.  I got him something else, too, so if he doesn't want them he can take them back.  I just had to get them, though. On Monday, I went to producton crew.  I didn't do any work, as usual;  keeping up the "'helpful Kay" tradition.  It was really funny, because when I walked in, I met with a group of freshmen, and they all said, "hi Kay!!"  I said hi back, but I didn't know what any of their names were, except Mr. B.  It's good to be known.  It made me feel special. I'm watching The Simpson's and Bart and Mrs. Krobapple went to see a movie called "Nature's Biggest Holes."  haha.  I laughed so hard. I'm taking driving school over break.  Adrienne and the Tabors are in my class.  It goes from 8am to noon for 6 days.  The first day I was really bored, so the second day, I brought a coloring book and colored the entire time.  It was loads of fun.  Except for the whole waking up early thing.  That sucks.

      Read my funny mad lib: "If I could invent a holiday, it would be glasses Day. On this day, school would only be open for 72 minutes. Banks would give $13.75 to anyone who asked for it. Grocery stores would give out free sweet potatoes. And punk rock bands would give free concerts in driveways. The sun would always be out and the temperature would be 24 degrees. Parents would have to go to France, Spain, or China on business trips so my friends and I can have our van down by the river to ourselves. Little sisters and brothers would go to clock museums with uncle's houses so we wouldn't have to babysit. My friends and I would ride through the streets on sailboats, screaming "holy shitbags!" at the top of our lungs. After dark, we would spend 100 days on the phone without getting interrupted. Then we'd watch Grendel movies all night eating Cheetos and drinking hot urinade."

      I had the best weekend.  On Friday, I went to Plaid Tidings with Barnstormers.  Before the play, we had a party in the L-room and I had to play one of their stupid improvisational games.  For my prize, the officers gave me a a boyfriend thing that grows when you put him in water.  Haha.  Very funny guys!  I was not amused.  Marge asks me everyday if I've started growing him yet.  Nope. Saturday was awesome.  I "helped" at the fruit sale in the morning.  I got to hang out with Abbey, PT, and Adrienne.  It was loads of fun.  That night was the chamber choir party.  For dinner, PT could have sat anywhere, but he chose to sit next to me!!!!!!!!!  I was so excited.  While we were exchanging gifts, the power went out.  Then, we went carolling in the dark.  It was some of the most fun I've had in a long time.  I really enjoyed it. After the party, Marge, Diana, Abbey, and I went to Jake's house.  We watched the last half hour of Finding Nemo with them, then left because a certain person was there.  Marge and Diana went home, but I went to Abbey's house because we never get to hang out anymore.  We watched Pirates, but both fell asleep about 45 minutes into the movie.  She walked me home at 1:30 in the morning. David has a girlfriend.  He said, "her name is Julie, she is a piano major, and has perfect pitch."  I laughed so hard.  Of all the things he could tell us about her, the most important was that she has perfect pitch.  Haha.  perfect pitch! Choir concert tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!  I am so excited.  I get to process down the aisle while singing silent night, then sing Heilig with mixed.  I have been waiting for this since 7th grade when I first came to the christmas choral concert! Tonight is the night that I get my PSAT scores back.  I am so anxious.  I really want to know if I am a national merit scholar.  I bet I won't be, but I need to know now!  I will know in one hour.   so nervous. chemistry is so confusing! Perfect pitch.  ha!

      Not to brag or anything, but I must say that I looked gorgeous today.  I was wearing my new black pants and a cute little shirt I got at Charlotte Russe.  PT and Abbey were talking after orchestra today, so I went over to them.  Peter looked at me and said that my shirt was all twisted up, and that I must've gotten dressed on the dark.  It was so hilarious.  Then, in choir, I was telling Marge the story, and he walked by in the middle of my story.  I was a little embarassed, but I don't think he noticed that i was talking about him. I got to ride next to him on the chamber field trip.  It was fabulous.  We didn't really get a  chance to talk because Laura was playing crappy music really loudly.  I couldn't think of anything to say, though.  I was sad. I got to hear Vive sing Duke of Earl today!!!  It was so gorgeous!!!  I wanted to die.  Ned is fabulous. Abbey signed me up to work the Fruit Sale on Saturday morning.  She's trying to be sly because PT signed up for then, too.  Thankfully, Abbey will be there. David is home!!  Yay.  He makes me so happy.  I've been feeling really good lately, but with David home, everything is 10X better. Tomorrow, choir is touring the middle schools.  I am so excited.  We're going to the mall to eat.  I'm missing through 6th period.  Then, I get to take a math test 7th period.  Something to look forward to.  Horoscope time: "Your eyes are greener than usual, but it's no thanks to color contacts. You're insanely jealous of your BFF and her new BF. You may think it's because you really want your own guy, but it's because you miss spending more time with your girl. Let her know."   Abbey, I miss you and our daily walk home!! :(

      This is today's horoscope:    "Even though you've never had a driving lesson in your life, you're convinced you're a naturally excellent driver. We beg to differ. Resist the temptation to take your mom's car out for an illegal spin, and just wait until that permit is lawfully earned."  So true, its frightning.

      My weekend was ok.  Saturday I went to Marge's and watched X2 with Abbey, Tim, Maureen, Juan, Marge (of course) and Ned, Nora, and Nick showed up later.   I wasn't in a talkative mood, so they made fun of me for saying but 2 words that night. I drove on Sunday!!!!  My mom took me to the north lot and I drove for about 45 minutes.  I'm really bad at it, but it was fun.  I wanted to drive home, but my mom wouldn't let me.  I can't blame her. I went major shopping on Sunday, tambien.  I went to Old Navy with all my babysitting dinero.  I got an awesome pair of pantalones negros and I can't wait to wear them. Today is my 16 and 1/2 birthday!  But, even more importantly, it's Abbey's birthday!!!!!  I know you probably will never read this, but,          HAPPY BIRTHDAY ABBEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   (I would have made the font bigger, but I don't know how.) I felt really bad today because I had been planning for a really long time to decorate our locker on Abbey's b-day, but I completely forgot about that idea until halfway through the school day.  I knew her b-day was coming up, and that i should do something for her, I just never made the connection in my head.  So, guess what?  Tomorrow I'm going to fill the inside of our locker with balloons, so when she opens it, she will be bombarded with balloons.  Since it's not her birthday tomorrow, she won't suspect a thing.  Hehe.  I am so mischevious.  Except not. I get to be in private voice lessons!!!!!  Finally!  I have been on Miss Codispoti's waiting list since the beginning of sophomore year.  I have my first one on Friday.  Now I won't have to miss Peter at voice class.  Everything worked out for the best.  yay. It's getting late, I should probably do some tarea or something productive.  I have an english vocab quiz tomorrow, a chem test Wednesday, and a math test on Thursday.  The wind ensemble concert is Wednesday. David is coming home Wednesday!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You have no idea how excited I am!  I am so sick of living in this house with just mis padres.  I love David.  P.S.  don't mind the occasional spanish words, sometimes they just come out.

      I just got back from a little choir festival that chamber sang for.  I didn't go out with people afterward for one reason and one reason only.  Instead of spending time with my usual group, I got to spend 5 minutes in the back seat of Diana's car with PT on the way home.  I am so pathetic, but since he quit voice, I never get to talk to him.  I was hoping that he'd be going out with Diana and Neil, but he's sick, so he just went home.   Now that I think about it, I probably should have gone out with Diana and Neil.  I could get in with Neil, and have him put in a good word for me. (Not that I don't have enough people doing that.)   Chamber went to sing at the Westwood Country Club during school.  We took a bus, and unfortunately, there was an odd number of people.  Guess who got to sit by herself on the way there AND on the way back?????  That's right, ME.  I love being the shy, young one.   The boys in chamber are so stupid.  Both today and yesterday they seperated themselves from the girls; yesterday when we were eating and today on the bus.  Doc Hanson said that this was the first time that had ever happened in all her years of teaching.  Anyway.... I am the most emotional and sensitive person ever.  Today I almost started crying for the stupidest reason.  It wasn't important at all.  It's a long story, so I'm not going to write it all out, but it so wasn't worth crying over. I have to wake up early tomorrow, and i don't want to.  I have wind symphony, and I really don't want to go.  I never want to go.  I honestly don't know why I'm in it.  I don't like it.  I probably won't do it next year. I wish I had good conversational skills.  I need to talk more; specifically to PT.  I can never find the guts to just go up and start talking to him.  The time(s) that I do, I don't know what to say past "hi" and maybe one other comment.  I'm such a loser in that department. I finally got my temps today!!!  Yay!!  It sucks, though, because my parents won't let me drive in this weather (it's snowing really hard.)  I can get my licence before my 17th birthday.  My dad said he wanted me driving by summer.  I am so excited.  I'll be able to drive for my senior year!  I can't wait.

      This is my "lovescope" for this week: "All you can say is, “Farewell and thanks!” Gemmy. Things didn't work out between you two. In this case, it wasn't anyone's fault in particular. Sometimes both people just realize the relationship isn't really getting any deeper. It's better to jump ship than be perpetually bored with one another, but pretend like you aren't. Someday your prince will come."  This is my daily horoscope: "It's a real bummer, but people change -- even the ones you never thought could. If an old friend is suddenly acting less than friendly, she may not be worth fighting for. It's probably time to cut your losses, as hard as that might seem."  They make me so hopeful!  They suck major ass.  They are BOTH bad.   I need to start doing some homework because I never do homework at home EVER.  I don't want to.  I'm going to take a long, hot bubble bath.

      Ok, I actually know what I'm doing now.  My computer was acting weird.  Anyway... I hate to start this thing off on a bad note, but I am in a crappy mood right now.  I had a really awesome day in school, though.  I got to sing a whole lot because there was chamber this morning, then we went on a little field trip 6th period.  Chemistry was really fun today, too.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Rita and I had the giggles and seriously laughed for 40 minutes straight.  For some reason as soon as I got to the barnstormers meeting after school, I was in the worst mood.  I didn't want to talk to anyone at all. GRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!  I am so angry that they didn't announce what the musical is.  I have been waiting for this announcement since February, and now I have to wait even longer. Does anyone actually LIKE hanging out with me?  Lately, it seems like no one likes me at all.  But then again, sometimes things seem bigger to me than they actually are. One last thing.  Monday night I went out with 4 boys!  Count 'um; 1,2,3,4!  Jake, Greg, Nick, and Joe.  We went to Wendy's after the chamber performance.  It was barrels of fun. I get to sleep in tomorrow. yay.

      "What's up with your love life? It seems like the more you go for it, the more goes wrong! Try this: relax and stop trying so hard. Let it all happen naturally." hmmm...... so true...  Today was solo and ensemble contest.  I got two 1's.  That means that I am "superior" times two.  The stupid judge lady was really far behind because she was taking too long to write up the score sheets.  So, she decided that it would be OK to stop people in the middle of their piece after she's heard enough.  She stopped me 3 minutes into my 8-minute concerto.  I was a little angry, but mostly confused.  I got a 1 anyway, so I really don't care anymore.  Mrs.  Maskow went in and yelled at her for at least 5 minutes because she made one of her students cry.  That was the last time she stopped someone.  haha. I'm getting sick.  Argh.   What kind of a sound is that?  Argh?  When does anyone ever make that sound?

You're a talkative, detail-oriented person who tends to let it all out "and out" and out, which some friends find booooorrrring. Find a person who relishes the drama and spill, girl!"  hehe

      horoscope for today: "Stop frowning about your lack of affection from the opposite sex. Even the steadiest beau would choose holding a hockey stick over holding your hand sometimes. Who needs a guy to cuddle with? Happiness is the warmest, thickest blanket in the house." That's a load of crap. Abbey managed to do it again.  She brought up a new boy that she thinks would go well with me.  Coincidentally, Marge thought the same thing.  Now, he's on my mind constantly.  I still don't know if I like him, and apparently, a few other girls like him too.  This is so weird. Snowball is in about a month.  I have to start thinking about if I will go or not.  I don't want to ask anyone, and I'm perfectly fine with not going.  So I am only going if, by chance, someone decides to ask me. There is a serious lack of boys at Lakewood High.  All the good ones are taken by whores. That last statement is a little harsh, but unfortunately, its true. So, yeah, I'm a little bitter today.  What's new? I'm going to bed early tonight, so I bid you (let's see if I can spell this right) adeiu.

      I have so much work to do, yet I'm upstars writing in my blog, wasting perfectly good homework time.  I am so happy that the semester is almost over, and the play is almost done.  I am definitely ready for my 3 day break. I'm in one of those weird spots in my life where there are no boys.  None of the boys I have in my life are new.  It's just same old, same old.  I'm almost going backwards.  The one boy that I'm sort of thinking about has a girlfriend.  It's just not working out for me.  hmmm.............

      "As Edna walked along the street she was thinking of Robert.  She was still under the spell of her infatuation.  She had tried to forget him, realizing the inutility of remembering.  But the thought of him was like an obsession, ever pressing itself upon her.  It was not that she dwelt upon the details of their aquaintance, or recalled in any special or peculiar way his personality; it was his being, his existence, which dominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an incomprehensible longing." -The Awakening by Kate Chopin, my new favorite book  I'm supposed to be writing a paper for my english H project.  I don't want to.  I haven't started actually writing yet.  I've come to terms with the fact that I will be getting very little sleep tonight.  I just have no motivation to write.  I won't even be in school at all tomorrow.  There's a band field trip, but I still have to turn my paper in.  That sucks.  I am so tired.  I just want to sleep.  But, there's so much that needs to be done.  I must stay awake. Well, I should be off, because I need to start writing.  Hopefully, inspiration will come.

      So I took this quiz to see if I could make the Cheerleading Squad just for laughs.  I like my results, they're hilarious.  I'm a "team member."  "You've got what it takes girl, but you won't bend over backwards (unless it's part of the routine!) to do anything and everything. You maintain a good balance between what you want to do and what you can do. You're talented, coordinated, lively and fun, but you're not over-the-top. People wouldn't assume that you're a cheerleader, but once they find out you are, it'll seem obvious. You wear your team colors with pride, but not in a conceited, show-off way."

      I did my chemical pie project today with Rita, Lucia, and Marika.  It was loads of fun.  While the pie was baking, we went on an ice cream run to Tops so we could have apple pie a la mode.  We saw Johanna and Katie Mervart at the U-scan thing with about a million rolls of toilet paper.  It was so funny.  I wonder what they're doing tonight? I wish I could figure out how to put pictures on this thing, so I could show off my new habit.   Not much else going on.  I think I have a new infatuation, but I don't know for sure.  We'll see.  I talk to him a lot, so I'm in a much better situation then I was before. I am so excited about the choir trip to Chicago!  I'm rooming with Marge!  Yay.  We're going to see West Side Story, too.  I can't wait! I'm really glad that the play will be over in 2 weeks, because I don't think I can handle having Abbey gone from me for much longer.  I miss her so. Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite.

      The girlfriend is here again.  I can stand her in small doses, but this is too much.  I understand that it's the holiday season, and they're off from college, but don't they have something else to do or friends to hang out with?

      Matt comes into town to take karate and he drops his girlfriend off at our house while he's there.  The first thing I thought was, "what the f***???!!!" I thought this was an appropriate story, because of my title. Both David and I are seeking refuge upstairs.

      Last night was so much fun!  A girl's night out was just what I needed. Yesterday morning was a stupid math contest that I signed up for (why, I do not know).  I was told some stuff by someone that I'm really not sure about.  I hope he was just kidding, though he said it quite matter-of-factly.  hmmm...  I hope I'm over thinking this, as usual.  It turns out my parents do understand, and they're helping me out.  I am so spoiled.

      On the news, they were talking about President Bush's proposal to add an amendment to the constiution to stop gay marraige.  One reverand, obviously in favor of it, said: "It's like stopping a disease from spreading." I was absolutel appauled. Some people are so ignorant.  They think that the Bible says that being a homosexual is sinful.  The Bible also says that God's law is man's law.  That means if we decide that being gay is ok, then God thinks it's ok. Some people are so narrow minded.

      Spread sunshine all over the place just put on a happy face!  I realized that lately (actually since about September) I've been really down.  There's really been no point, except that looking sad gets me attention.  No one likes a sour puss.  No one wants to hang out with someone who is always down, because it brings them down.  So, I decided that I am no longer going to be an attention seeking drama queen.  I will be happy. yay  "Her name is Kay she lives in a bay in a barn with hay because she's Kay."   -Song and lyrics by Rita

      today's horoscope: "You've been especially quiet for the last few days, Gemini, and that makes people nervous. Come outta your shell today and show 'em that all is well."  It sometimes amazes me that these things are right almost half the time.  Then I realized that I am always quieter than usual.

      Good day today.  Except the fact that I have a lot of work to do that I have been putting off for far too long.  And now I am putting it off even farther. I read something about 2 minutes ago that made me so upset.  Go to margaretmargemeg.blogspot.com.  Read the first entry for Wednesday.  It desturbs me a lot.  If it says what I think it says, then I just give up.  All boys are scum and none of the nice ones like me.  I went out to eat with my daddy today.  I love my dad so much.  I like hanging out with him.  I am definitely a daddy's girl. I need to talk to Abbey.  Maybe I'll go out with her on Friday. I am so tired.

      I am such a freakin loser.  I have major problems.  They say that shyness is genetic, but I really wish there was something I could do.  Why can I never think of anything to say?  Ever? Nick and Greg, I know you won't ever read this, but you two are the two most imporant guys in my life.  (besides my daddy)  You take care of me and I love you so much for that.  You are my care-takers when David is away.  I would be miserable without you.  I miss riding in your car on summer nights with our friends, listening to whatever it is that you put on (though my favorite is J.Lo and Ja Rule).  I love how when I'm upset, you do your best to make me feel better.  Hugs, arm around my shoulder, hand on my back, high fives...  I love it all and I love you more than you could ever imagine.  You make me feel special.  I am eternally grateful for your kindness and charm. Just wanted you to know.

      I got new glasses.  They are so cute. Rita told me that in 6th grade someone told her that my name wasn't really Kay.  The person told her that I had just made that up because I wanted to be cool.  That's funny.  I wish I knew who that person was because they obviously had just met me. I don't want to go back to school. 50 First Dates is a REALLY good movie.  I highly recommend it.  It is not your typical Adam Sandler movie.  It is really cute and I wish I could see it again.

      Auditions are over.  Now all that's left to do is sit around and wait.  I got to make a fool out of myself dancing today.  There was this one part of the dance I just couldn't get where we were supposed to do some kicking thing for about a million counts.  So, I just kind of flailed about for awhile with a big smile on my face.  I figured if I could make them laugh, they might just let me be a part of their play.  At least it was an improvement on last year.  And I made Nick laugh. I really want Margaret to get her lead role.  She so deserves it.  I know she would blow everyone away with her amazing talent. All I can say is if I am not on the cast list, I am taking the day off.  I don't want what happened last year to happen again. Waiting is the worst....

      Horoscope for today: You'll be in a very social mood, and you may want to express what's in your heart through a creative project. ~~Dance or drama are two good ways to show off your inner beauty to the rest of the world.~~ Working with kids will also be fun for you now. Maybe you can be a big sister to a little girl who needs a few tips on getting through schoolyard scrapes. You'll feel loving and giving. A date is sure to notice your kindness.  ~~  ~~    How appropriate!!

      The dramatic auditions were today.  I thought I did very well.  It was a big improvement from last year.  I remembered my lines, and actually moved around a little bit.  I am very proud of myself, whether I make it or not. Tomorrow are the singing auditions and I am so excited.  Not only do I love to sing in front of people, but I get to sing with boy!  I only hope I get someone who can at least carry a tune and stay in pitch.  I cannot wait. Wednesday is dance; the most difficult for me.  That is the day it all comes down to.  I need something that will improve my memory just for those 2 or 3 hours of the day, then I will be alright.  I'm really nervous about those. Even now that my dramatic audition is over, I'm still reciting my lines over and over again in my head.  "I have no one to take me and it is because of my father...He practically forbids me to have a boyfriend...Oh, you won't tell them will you, Madame?"  It is so weird. I'm actually in a good mood tonight.  Hopefully, that will maintain after this week is over.  ...so nervous....so nervous...so nervous....so nervous...so nervous...so nervous...

      I'm having loads of fun watching the Lion King.  I watched 2 episodes of Qeer Eye for the Straight Guy in a row. I was supposed to watch accent movies with Abbey and Marge, but no one called me.  I guess I could have called one of them, but I am stupid.  I have issues with calling people.  I am such a stupid, stupid person.  Sometimes I don't understand myself. There's so much I have on my mind, but for some reason, I just don't want to talk bout it. Musical tryouts are on Monday.  I'm kind of nervous.  I think I have my english accent down.  I'm only really worried about the dance auditions.  I cannot dance at all.  Hopefully, it's something easy that I can remember. I really love The Wedding Planner.  It's one of the best movies ever.  I could watch it over and over again. Maybe I'll be ready to talk about things later.

      So it's almost 10:30, and I have yet to start studying for my chemistry test tomorrow.  But I did manage to make brownies, rigatoni, and a cardboard drum for an english skit.  I certaintly have my priorities straight. Today is David's birthday.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAVID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To celebrate, my parents and I went down to Kent to visit.  We ate out for lunch, and were at the restaurant for about 2 and a half hours.  It was crazy. There are 9 seconds left in the 4th quarter, and they are tied at 29.  oooo... I wonder who will win. (wow, 4 W's in a row, 5 if you count wow)  Not that I really care about the Super Bowl.  Supposedly, Nick had a Super Bowl party.  Abbey told me about it, but I was not invited.  hmmm.... I had a really good lazy, sit around, and do nothing weekend.  I enjoyed it.  I wish I could have one more day. Tomorrow is the info meeting for musical tryouts.  Here starts the rest of my academic year.  All of my happiness depends on these next two weeks.  Next Thursday will be the first day of the rest of my life.  Hopefully, all will go as planned. New England won.  yay. I will stay healthy.  I will stay healthy.  I will stay halthy.  I will stay healthy.  I will stay healthy.  I will stay healthy.  I will stay healthy.  I will stay healthy.  If i write it enough times it will come true.  I will stay healthy.  I will stay healthy.  I will stay healthy.

      So, apparently I can't read.  I was supposed to do this alumni band thing tonight and I was very excited about it.  I thought that we were supposed to meet at the high school, so I left my clarinet in the band room at the high school.  I got there tonight and no one was there and the band room was locked.  I re-read the sign about it and it turns out we were supposed to meet at the middle school.  I was so upset.  I am so upset.  I can't believe I have to miss the concert because I didn't take the time to read the f***ing sign!!  I am so angry.

      This weekend was so much fun! Friday, Barnstormers went to see The Underpants.  It was hilarious, but I thought it was a little inappropriate for a school to go see.  Especially since there were a few things that the adults were laughing a lot about that I didn't get.  Then, Abbey, Marge, Josh, Greg, Lauren, Jake and I went to Gold Coast.  I had a lot of fun. Saturday I went to Old Navy with Lucia and Rita.  That was also muy divertido.  I got this adorable white linen skirt and these flip flops with a little kitty heel to match.  I can't wait to wear it!  Later that night, Rita and I saw Starsky and Hutch.  It was cute.  I know that Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are like 30 years old, but they were so HOT in this movie.  I think it was the big bad cop thing, but they were irrisistable.  Then we went to Caribou for some hot cocoa and some lovely conversation.  Saturday was one of the best days I've had in a long time. I really want it to be warm out.  I want to wear sandals and cute little skirts and shorts and tank tops and walk around barefoot.  So basically, I want to be able to dress like a whore.  There's nothing wrong with that, right?  J/K Only one more quarter of school!  Actually, I am kind of excited about marching band.  I never thought I'd say that ever again, but I can't wait.  I'm only happy about it, though, if I am field commander.  That would be so nice.  I would love that job.  As long as I am not a section leader again. I cannot wait for SUMMER!!!!!

I need to sleep so I can get better, but then I'll have no time to do my work! I cannot wait until Friday at 3:00pm.

      Listen to this: "You're Cupid's Queen.  Shocked? Well, you shouldn't be. It's not the most brazen girl that always gets the guy. In fact, matchmakers love your vibe: sweet, subtle, and sophisticated. You're the opposite of boy crazy, which happens to drive guys wild. Do us a favor, when you're done breaking hearts and sprinkling your lovey-dovey dust on the boys, explain how you came to be this way at such an early age. Your divine sensibility can be summed up in the fact that you find the fun where someone else sees a reason to panic. Your instincts call for being coy, while another girl goes all out to be noticed — so simple, but so rare. Check your horoscope because February's lookin' really good for you!"  That makes me feel good.

      I'm really enjoying my life right now.  I think that my relationships with people are going well.  I've come to terms with the fact that it will probably be awhile before I get a boyfriend, and I'm not upset about it.  I have guy friends that I can hang out with.  One in particular. I am so happy that it is Friday.  I think I feel like staying in this weekend.

      It's been a while, but not much has happened.  Firday night, I did my chem extra credit with my junior friends.  Me, Rita, Michelle, and Lucia made homemade ice cream at Leah's.  It was loads of fun.  We played soccer, hot potato, and bowled with our coffee can full of ice cream.  Even though it ended up like a milkshake, and tasted like coffe because Rita didn't wash out the coffee can (which tasted kind of good, actually), I had a really good time.  It's good to know that maybe I will have friends after my seniors leave. Saturday was Scrabble Tournament night!  Rami, Abbey, and I were on one team,  Marge and Greg (of course) on another, and Diana, Kenny, and Josh were the third.  Abbey, Rami, and I were winning by a lot until Greg and Marge scored 45 points on one word.  Despite our loss, it was so much fun!!!  I can't wait to do it again.  You know how much of a geek I am when my friends and I get together for Scrabble tournaments, and can't wait for the next one.  Oh well.  I really did have an amazing time. Things are going pretty well.  I am in a much better mood than I was a few months ago.  I have come to terms with my boyfriendless state.  I am OK.

      I am so overwhelmed with work lately.  Chemistry is so hard.  We are studying for the AP test, and are taking 2 quizzes every day.  I am totally bombing them all, too.  I am taking the SAT this Saturday, and the AP Chem test is next Friday.  I have to finish reading this long-ass book for engilsh by Thursday, and do 2 worksheets on it.  I have to do my math homework for this week and take a test on Thursday.  The musical is this weekend, so I have to spend every evening from 6-10 at school practicing.  SO MUCH WORK!!!!!! The only thing I look forward to is going to musical practice so I can watch him dance.  He is so adoreable!  I wish he didn't have a girlfriend.

      This is the most appropriate horoscope for me I've ever read: "He loves your smile, so why are you hiding it? Somehow, you got the idea that you'll look like a dork if you admit you're having fun. But how will he know he's doing anything right if you keep a stone face? Show him those pearly whites!"

I keep thinking that I can't wait to go to school tomorrow to talk to everyone about prom, then I realize they won't be there.  That is so sad. I am supposed to be doing my english project.

      So I heard prom was fun all around.  Good.  I noticed that Nick did not get a flower; shows how much she loves him. I went major shopping with my mom yesterday.   I got a pair of capris, shorts, and a tank top.  Then, today I found a really cute swimsuit.  I am so excited about the beach!  We are leaving in 12 days! I now weigh less than I did in 6th grade.  That is so crazy.  I was a fat little girl. I think I'm going to take my dog for a walk.  Sounds like fun!

      I got my yearbook today!  Marge signed it.  She wrote a lot, which I was happy about, but when I got about half way through it, I started getting teary-eyed.  We were in choir and I had to sit with my head tilted back so no tears would fall.  Marge is such a sweetheart. I had a really good day today.

      So next year, my posse will be CiCi, Josh, Lauren, Peter, Erika, and Brendan.  I was so excited last night when we got 2 more boys.  I told the people around me that they coudn't borrow my pen unless they voted for a boy.  I think last night was the first night I actually felt excited about next year.  I am really happy with the group of people we've got.  (not to mention I am way cooler than Erika or CiCi!  j/k, no really, don't you think?) And yet, I am so upset that my friends are leaving.  Lately I've felt kind of left out by Marge and Abbey.  I haven't gotten to talk to them much.  Abbey never goes to english anymore, so I never get to see her after school; the only time I ever see her.  I will miss them so much.  And Greg, and especially Nick. Last night, at the banquet, I arrived late (not on purpose.)  When I walked in (looking hot), Nick and CiCi yelled my name, then Ned announced my arrival on the microphone.  Everyone clapped and I half-curtsied.  Then Ned said I looked hot.  It was the best entrance I have ever made.  I wish that happened every time I walked into a room.  Plus, I was the only non-officer at the officers table.  They saved me a seat.  I was so happy. Life is good, but I only have 2 days left.

      Last night I had the best time at the choir concert.  We got a standing ovation.  It was amazing.  I got a little emotional.  Nick won the Bell Award, I was so happy for him, he definitely deserved it. I've decided that this summer, I am going to drop out of high school, move to Finland, marry a nice Finnish boy, and live on a reindeer farm in the middle of nowhere of Finland.  It is so much better than that idea of being a senior, then going to college and majoring in vocal performance.  so much better.

      I had a dream about him last night.  It makes me happy, but at the same time so depressed because I know it will never happen.  I just don't know what to think anymore.   It's not so much that I think something could happen, but that I'm not ready to let go yet.  I just want to stay this way for a little while longer. Last night after the chamber and vive concert, I went out with Diana, Marge, Lauren, and Julie.  I didn't think that I was going to have a good time at all, but I actually had fun.  It was nice to go out with some new people.  No boys.  No pressure.  I was just myself, and I had a really good time. I am so frustrated with everything.  I don't want this school year to be over, and yet I do.  I want to be done with tests, projects, homework, and waking up early.  But, I don't want to say goodbye to my friends.  I want to have chamber in the morning, and see people in band and choir, and walk home with Abbey. I think the thing I will miss the most is my morning walk from Chamber to the L-room with Marge, and mostly Nick.  That is the thing that I look forward to everyday.  I can't wait until Mon, Tues, or Thurs, so I can just spend some time with him.  That will be the thing I miss the most.

      Abbey and I did homework in the park tonight.  It was fun.  We actually talked most of the time.  We didn't get much work done, as I suspected we wouldn't. I got my SAT scores today.  I got a 700 on the math!  woo woo

      I realized today that I will have no friends next year in choir, band, or barnstormers.  Those are the three things that my life revolves around.  I don't know what I will do.  I have to be on stage with CiCi and Erika and Lauren.  I could handle one or two of them, but all three???!!!  Together??!!  We had better elect some boys as Thespian officers, otherwise I will shoot someone!  Last night, the power went out at our house from 8:30 to 1:00am.  It was so much fun.  My mom was upstairs working on a project, so it was just me and the men downstairs, and we talked for hours.  It was just like good old times.  I wish the power would go out more often.  I always have more fun when there's no electricity. I am going to miss these times so much when they're over.

      All of my friends have been gone all week for AP testing, so I haven't seen any of them.  When I do, they always have somewhere else to be or someone else to talk to.  It seems like they don't have time for me anymore.  I feel so left out.  Like they don't want me anymore. All I can think is, "Is this what it's going to be like next year?"   If it is, I want out, now.  There is no way I will be able to deal with having all of my friends gone.  I will miss them more than words can describe.

      None of my friends were in school today. I was so lonely. Jake is trying to set me up with Steve.  What is he thinking?  He's a nice guy, and all, but totally not my type.  He is quiet, I am quiet.  How would that work?  We wouldn't talk. Plus, I want to wait until September before I start with another guy.  I need to make sure that I am completely available for him when he and his girlfriend break up.  That sounds lame, but it is so true.

      It bothers me so much that I am hung up over a guy that I can't have.  What is wrong with me?  Why can't I just move on?  He obviously likes his girlfriend much more than he likes me, otherwise he wouldn't be dating her.  I guess it just seems like a lot of wasted time and energy.  But I like him so much...

      Last night Marge and I saw The Notebook.  It was sooooooo good!!  We were in a theater full of girls and we were all sobbing.  It was hilarious.  The guy who played Noah was REALLY hot...really....yep....hot..... gorgeous.  10 days!

      I am so worried that I am getting my hopes up about seeing him again.  I do that a lot and I always end up really upset and wondering if only I had done something different in the beginning it would be better.  I am afraid that I like him so much more than he likes me.  That he'll have moved on with his own life like nothing ever happened. It's happened before.

      I am so miserable.  Most of my friends are out of town, and the two that aren't are not home.  The man I love lives in Pittsburgh.  What am I to do? Hopefully, time will pass quicker once Emily, Abbey, and Diana get home.  Maybe I'll have something to do to keep my mind off him. LIfe just doen't seem that important right now.

      you stole my heart we didn’t even kiss I got chills when you were near me I just love your stare Those bright green eyes looking straight into mine it made me nervous, I felt alive you were such a gentleman always let me go first we stayed up late playing pointless games that’s not just something ordinary why didn’t you make a move? I wouldn’t have minded in fact I wish you would have I wished upon a star that night unfortunately it didn’t come true all I wanted was a kiss just one from you now you live hours away you could get my number if you wanted still my phone is silent can’t we go back to that place? it was like heaven on earth 20 days is too long to wait  to see your face again all I can think of is that ride you promised me but I’m just stuck here in my town you in yours wondering what could have happened

      I met the man I am going to marry last week.  He is a friend of my cousin's.  He is absolutely the most gorgeous person (inside and out) I have ever met.  The only problem is that he lives in Pittsburg, which is a 3 hour drive from my house.  But I will see him on July 10. I can't wait that long.

      Last night I saw Troy with Rita and Lucia!  Brad Pitt is the HOTTEST man alive.  I felt bad for Orlando Bloom because Paris, the guy he played, was such a dousch.  (I doubt I spelled that right)  When he was fighting Menelaus, All I could think was, "oh no, don't let him die, he's so pretty!" I am leaving for Myrtle Beach in 20 hours!  I am so excited!  So, unless anything interesting happens between now and then, I won't be updating this thing until I get back in a week. Something to think about whilst I am gone:  Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things.

      I am a field commander!!!!!!!!!  I am so excited! (except for the person that I get to do it with) Tonight was loads of fun.  I really enjoyed just talking with the girls.  It was refreshing to know that everyone else has major problems with things too. Yesterday, my mom threw me a surprise b-day party.  It wasn't much, and I didn't have a whole lot of fun, but I truely appreciate the effort.  It was so thoughtful. Plus, there was cake. He hasn't been very kind lately.  He's only nice when his girlfriend's not around.  When she is, he can't keep his hands off her.  He didn't even say goodbye before he left.  I was so upset.  You can't just leave a party and not say bye.  It is rude.  Everyone else said goodbye.  Is that too much to ask? Things are really up in the air right now.

      I was kind of upset before that I couldn't work on my english project with Jake.  Peter came over today to work on it, and I was pleasantly surprised.  We had a good time.  There was no awkward silence, it was fun.  Now I'm glad that I didn't work with Jake, he intimidates me a lot with school work. Happy Birthday Marge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tomorrow is our last full day of school before finals!  I am excited beyond belief!  Once lunchtime on Friday comes, I will be home free!!!!!!!!  I cannot wait. In the meantime, I have tons of work to do.  I have an entire english project, math H-project, and english essay to do by Friday.   It's good to still be in school.  Damn seniors. Emily is home!  I am so excited, yet I feel so bad because I have so much work to do, so I have no time to hang out with her.  Oh well, I will have all weekend. I am seriously counting down the hours.  38 and counting....

      so here's the plan: Adam is going to get married in the next few years; it's inevitable because he's such an awesome guy.  I, will of course go because I am family.  Jon will be invited because he and Adam are really good friends.  There, we will talk and dance at the reception and our love will be rekindled.  We will both be in our early 20's and ready to start a relationship.  How perfect. This is the best part: Jon and I met at the beach. So, for our honeymoon and anniversaries, we will go to Myrtle Beach.  Isn't that so cute?  It's so romantic.  I am looking forward to it.

      The newspaper said that it was going to be 83 today and mostly sunny.  As I look outside, I see no sun, and it is definitely not above 80 degrees.  I am very upset.  I was going to sunbathe today while I read my book.  It was going to be loads of fun and productive.  I would be getting a tan while doing work.  What's not to love?  Seriously, I am angry. It needs to get hot and sunny soon, because lately its been rainy and cold, not at all like July weather.  I am very upset.

      There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16  And it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 And it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now Things would get better We would leave this town And run forever Let your waves crash down on me  And take me away, yeah  There’s a piece of you that's here with me Its everywhere I go It's everything I see When I sleep I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now Things would get better We would leave this town And run forever I know somewhere, somehow We'll be together Let your waves crash down on me  And take me away, yeah  I remember that look in your eyes When I told you this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here Not now  When looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise We'll be together for one more night Somewhere Somehow  If I could find you now Things would get better We would leave this town And run forever I know somewhere, somehow We'll be together Let your waves crash down on me  And take me away, yeah

      Although Greg was probably upset about the lack of people at his party, I had fun.  I was glad that only my favorite people were there.  I enjoyed myself.  Nick's party was pretty fun, too.  I was ready to go home when I did, though.  All of a sudden I felt kind of annoyed by people and needed to go home.  I think I'm becoming a sociopath.  Seriously. I don't want to start back up with marching band.  I don't want to go back to school.  Are 17 year olds allowed to take a sabbatical? I am miserable

      I have nothing new to say, but I feel like I need to post somethinig. I can't believe Tim kept ragging on The Notebook.  It's not supposed to be realistic, it's a movie.  It's supposed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.  To give you hope that maybe you could fall in love like that, too.

      Why is Nick Aylward such an idiot?  It turns out that he really does like me a lot.  In fact, I remind him of Kim, his "ideal" girl.  He wishes that our timing wasn't so off.  He's not helpless here.  I don't understand why if he thinks Kim and I are so great, he's going out with Nora.  It's probably just because the sex is good and she likes him.  Another thing, why are they talking about marriage?  Nora said she was planning on marrying him.  That's crazy.  They're 18! You know what else?!  He said he was sad that I'm angry at him.  Well, maybe if he wasn't such a jerk, we wouldn't have this problem.  He also said that he's "worried about me."  That's crazy.  He's worried about you, too, Marge.  I think he's the only person anyone needs to be worried about.  I can't stand him. I'm doing a great job with boys lately.  The boy I really like lives in Pittsburgh, and he won't even ask for my phone number. ugh

      Last night was fun. I was sitting in my living room this morning watching tv with Matt and David and just thought how nice it was.  I miss having them around all the time, so when we're together it makes me so happy. I can't wait until our family reunion in August so I can see all of my family that I haven't seen in years. (or days, in some cases) I'm in a much better mood today.

      I'm in an interesting mood today. I was just thinking, what if I don't see Jon in August?  It's a family reunion and just because he came to the last one doesn't mean he'll come to this one.  He's not family.  What if I never see him again?  I would be so sad.  What is there to do? I need to have a long conversation with someone.  There's so much going on in my head that I need to spill. I'm upset.

      The weekend was fabulous, well, at least most of it. Adam's party was so much fun.  I don't know whether it was a good thing or not that I saw Jon again.  Now, he's all I'm going to think about for another month, and I might not even see him the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I like him a lot a lot a lot, but there's nothing I can do about it. I think he likes me too, unless he's secretly a jerk and is just humoring me because he thinks we'll never see each other again.  Or he's just getting his kicks.  I don't know.  This is really confusing. He at least gave me a hug goodbye this time.  He also put his hand on my thigh when we were talking.  I practically died.  He pushed me on the swing.  We talked by ourselves for awhile again, too. Adam, his girlfriend Amy, and Jon were talking about me.  Amy told me.  That made me happy.  Adam thinks Jon wants me. WHY MUST WE LIVE THREE HOURS APART?????!!!! Something in me is convinced that we will be together at some point.  Now I am really worried that I am going to pick a college because I think Jon will be close by.  That's the worst reason to choose a college.  anyway... Nick is a retard.  He is so annoying.  I think I am going through a stage with Nick where I am going to need to hate him for awhile before I can actually hang out with him again.  He owes me big for calling my brother.  My mother is crazy. Abbey and I hung out with Nick and Nora last night.  It was horrible.  I hate hanging out with couples.  Marge always wants to go out with Tim and Maureen and now Abbey with Nick and Nora.  I do not enjoy it. My mom took pictures at the Adam's party.  There are a couple of Jon, but the one of just him is not an awesome picture.  He's smiling funny. what to do

Get a group of your friends together -- crush included -- to check out the display, but don't be surprised if you miss the whole show because you're too busy staring into your dream guy's eyes." yay  oh, I forgot, I got my driver's license!!!!!!  I got a PERFECT SCORE on the test!  The only bad thing is that my parents won't let me drive at night yet.  But, I do get to drive to marching band.  woo woo

      Do you believe in destiny, fate, that things can be meant to be, that things happen for a reason? I've been contemplating this lately.  I was always sure that things happened for a reason, but lately I'm not so sure. I don't know, I've just been in a pensive mood for about the past month.

      So it turns out that the e-mail thing was about my mom wanting to surprise my grandma at our reunion.  That was the "information" Rachel was talking about.   The reunion was cancelled.  It was supposed to be for my Uncle Don's 80th birthday, but he's in the hospital now, so they postponed the party.  That means it probably won't happen. I'm very upset.

      My mom got an e-mail from Adam's mom the other day.  This is the first line of it: "Got your e-mail, nice to hear from you.  I'll see that your information gets passed along to the appropriate people." All I can think is that my mom did something that I don't even want to think about.  She told someone something and I want to know what.  She also deleteld the message she sent from our sent folder, so there was something in it she didn't want people to see. Maybe I'm just overanalyzing.
