           I did my first real ride on the new frame during my commute home from work last night. I may need a new cassette, but I need to do some diagnostics before I throw money at the problem. My chain is slipping in the 21,19,and 18 cogs. The chain is new, of course, but the cassette only has twenty hours on it at best. I replaced my front inner chain ring after we built the frame up. It was worn slap out and you couldn't turn the pedals with any pressure without the chain jumping around like a lap dog.      My left knee was sore just under the cap and my hamstrings were aching during the ride in to the shop this a.m. I suspect my seat may need to come up a couple of millimeters, but the fit-stick says things are dead-on. If there is anything the past has taught me, it's not to monkey around with my position at the first sign of discomfort.      Ava and I made a "tent" with a bed sheet and two chairs last night. We huddled underneath while I read her favorite books.  I was supposed to go to my writer's group last night, but I stayed and spent time with Ava instead.  Typing it all up now gives me time to reflect on it and while last night I resented not going to the group (just a bit), this morning I know that April, Ava, and I are all better for me being home as much as possible. Ape lets me ride more than most wives, I'd imagine, so it's hard for me to complain at all.

      Joel, Scott, Jeremy, Graham, and I built up my new SpecialEdlized frame Saturday night. Becky and Matt brought by their fit-stick and it made things a ton easier. Special crit gorilla thanks to them for sitting through our antics....I'm just glad they left before the slap fight.   McDaniels won, hands down...or up...well, actually perpendicular. Joel's neck was the biggest casualty our unit suffered.  I wish I had more seatpost showing. My compact frame looks like a semi-sloping Mercxk. At least the top tube fits me.  A long time ago, when I rode for Chisholm, a team-mate told me I had a gorilla body and I really only race criteriums, so I'll call this blog crit gorilla.   A great friend of mine, Shawn Moore, is blogging his trip with his wife out west at moorewest.blogspot.com. I was confused and inadvertently opened a blog account when I tried to post a comment. I figured I'd write a little while I was here. Thanks for the idea Shawn.
