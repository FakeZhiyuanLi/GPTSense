       FUK la...the common tests already stressin me up liao... then now liddat... my bro pissed me off AGAIN!!! ass... call him do some chores, purposely spill the water all on the floor ass then call him cleanup gimme attitude... wtf loh... nvm clean up liao sua... then somemore keep scoldin bad words... in his room kpkb... wad is the world comin to... *anyway, i dun like ppl to say those bad words at home* so i was rather pissed by then...  then he started to scold me using vulgarities... ASS lo if i liddat let u scold me for no reason ah i not Jianming loh... then i warn him to shut up... he still kp... somemore purposely sacarstic... then i warn him again... then he purposely provoke me somemore loh... WAH~ that is the last straw liao... i slap him sia... then he not happy wanna whack me back... then i push him away, then scold him again... then he keep scoldin those words again... buay song liao..... i slap him again... then scold him... went back to my own room... then i was thinkin was i too hard on him... ARGH... shouldnt even have thot this way loh... he after awhile pack his stuff then went down to my aunt's house...  now they back le... fuk... and i suppose he complained about me la... ass usual... then my auntie jus call me... kp me loh... ask y i whack my bro... pls loh i only slap him loh... i say asked wad he did la... then she didnt care... i oso dun care liao....
