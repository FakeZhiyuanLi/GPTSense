      I'm so tired and the nights still young. I must be getting old =/ Its been a long day that started with a trip to the hairdressers. I hate going to the hairdressers. I always feel like such a numpty. I just sit there while all the other customers and staff seen to know each other so well and chat and joke away. I'm 1 of those really anti social people.I've been going to the same hairdressers for like 2 years and she never remembers me. She's ok tho as she doesn't ask all the usual stupid questions like " are you going out tonight", "where are you going on holiday" blah blah blah. The hairdresser 'bec' always makes me look all neat, tidy and grown up. I always feel wierd and urgh.....  we rented 'freaky friday and peter pan and watched it with owen,jess and ben(my siblings) this afternoon.Mick made them spam and egg sandwiches.(yuck). I liked freaky friday =) took the sprogs home and had to help my mum get ready for her school reunion which was amusing as she's so clueless.  i just watched big brother- evil big brother is fun- looks like it'll be good viewing this year. Thought friends was boring and predictable. Another hour of my life wasted!  Bored now....

      so here i am browsing on the net, unwinding after a strange day. The start of the strangeness was when i woke to hear really strange footsteps, It sounded like a person walking into the bedroom, i thought that maybe it was micks mum (she has her own key-for emergencies) i looked up and there was noone there. Then i thought it must be 1 of the cats, spike was asleep at the bottom of the bed so i thought oh its molly and went back to sleep. when the alarm went off and i told mick it dawned on me that ot couldn't of been molly as she doesn't make any noise when she trots around. It deffo sounded like a person treking around......... spooky!  went to the loo at work only to realise i had a huge toothpaste mark on my pretty pink 'hello kitty' top! wahhhh! i franticly rubbed at it but to no avail its been there all day, taunting me!  At lunch i stomped up to town- posted a vid to ben?, top to a buyer on ebay, letter to alex, swaps to izzy and snuggles. I spent ages in boots. It was so busy. I had been sent to get calpol and sudocreme for my nepheew who currently has chicken pox bless him. Theres a triple points offer on so people were buying the whole shop=( get a grip wierdos.  At last am fianlly home. Yay. Have some some domestic duties and i'm thinking of having a pampering session before settling doen to watch big bro. I'm currently downloading some razorlight stuff. Ilike them muchly and we're considering going to see them on weds before our flight. I think its prolly a bad idea as i haven't heard that much by them but tickets are only Â£8.   well, gonna dash off now and bung the pizza in the oven. i

      well i'm back from my holiday and its sooooo nice to be home. It was my first time abroad and it was great. I loved flying which made things easier i spose. The flight to bulgaria was a nightmare. We got on the plane at 6am and was told that we were going to be delayed..... 2 hours later we set off! Bulgaria is a gorgeous place, it was warm, cheap and the people are very friendly. We did a day trip to Romania too which i loved. I had a great holiday but don't want to go back to work on monday! I went shopping to leeds today with adele,mick and oliver and we bumped into debs and john in burger king which was fun. Claires now sells ruby gloom =) its really reasonable too. I got a keyring, a memo pad and a pack of stationery! yay! spoilt moi! sar
