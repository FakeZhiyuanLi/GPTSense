      This happens to have my name in it and I feel this way.   Mea Culpa Meaning "through my fault" in Latin, "mea culpa" comes from a prayer of confession in the Catholic Church. While said by itself it's an exclamation of apology or remorse ("It was my fault" or "I apologize"),

      Notice me, take my hand  Why are we strangers when  Our love is strong  Why carry on without me   Everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, it's haunting me  I guess I need you, baby   I make believe that you are here  It's the only way I see clear  What have I done  You seem to move on easy   Please forgive me  My weakness caused you pain  And this song's my sorry   At night I pray  That soon your face will fade away   And everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you, baby

      I hate the way you don't care I hate the way I feel  I hate being alone at night, when I want to share just all the time.  I have not been here for a while because I didn't want to hurt anymore.  Well the pain has not gone away, why did you have to do this to me? I think back and think was it all a lie?? It seems.  Do you remember Aug 12, 2001 I do and I remember how I felt...Scared, nervous, excited so many feelings it was wonderful....I dream of those times it was so happy.  I still have many questions.....  I have done stupid things past few weeks........Camera.....new car......why I don't know maybe just to prove I can be strong I don't know why.  Please be honest to yourself follow your heart.....don't be afraid. It will and did hurt but it was great while it lasted, as you know I would never turn it down.  Very lost and scared MD

      My grandmother use to say this to me everyday, to protect me. Maybe it truly will:  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. for ever and ever. Amen
