      I was doing some research for my novel, searching the web for a little history of the term 'WASP' and when it was first used. One of the links that came up on Google led me to a White Nationalist web site called  urlLink Stormfront.org . I poked around it a little bit, and now I feel somewhat sick.   It's easy to forget how many hateful assholes are out there. But what's really surprising to me is the fact that they're actually literate. I mean, the spelling and grammar in their bulletin board posts (with subject lines like "Cultural Differences, or are Blacks Just Plain Stupid?") is actually not bad. Which suggests that these people read books. And if they read books, how can they be so goddamned ignorant? I suppose if the only books you read are along the lines of  Mein Kampf , you can write a decent sentence and still have Neanderthal views of race and humanity. Still, it amazes me that people who think like that aren't living in caves and eating their own excrement. As they ought to be.

      Thought some of you might like to read Paula's article at: http://www.listener.co.nz/default,2034.sm  Why doesn't everyone check and post on the blog as obsessively as I do?

      I cut and paste this quotation from Matt Bivens' "The Daily Outrage" Blog which appended to thenation.com's home page.  ______________  It's hard to improve upon the opening to this dry, tiny Reuters report :  Two rehearsals for his prime-time speech were not enough to keep US President George W. Bush from mangling the name of the Abu Ghraib prison that brought shame to the US mission in Iraq.   During the half-hour televised address, Bush mispronounced Abu Ghraib each of the three times he mentioned it ... English speakers usually pronounce [it] as "abu-grabe". But the Republican president ... stumbled on the first try, calling it "abugah-rayp". The second version came out "abu-garon", the third attempt sounded like "abu-garah".   White House aides, who described the speech as an important address on the future of Iraq, said Bush practiced twice on Monday before boarding his helicopter for his trip to the speaking venue ...   If you want to see it for yourself, go to the White House web page for the President's speech, and click on the video option. Start listening 20 minutes into the speech -- just at the two-thirds mark -- and all the various mangled iterations of Abu Ghraib come in quick succession.   Reuters gets it basically right. But they don't quite communicate the look of angst that grips the President's face at his first effort, which actually comes out:   "Abugah ...   [Pause; President bobs head in internal struggle to shake free third syllable; a truly anxious moment when one feels a stab of sympathy for the man, and wonders if he'll be able to pull it off;]   ... rayp."   [Heavy sigh of relief. He did it! Hooray! George W. "low expectations" Bush surprises and pleases us once again. And to think he only had to practice twice beforehand!]

      Items of possible interest: 1.  I and my books and my pots & pans have arrived at  urlLink my destination .  16 hours of driving over two days--decent time, uneventful.  I spent the night in  urlLink Barkeyville, PA .   2.  In Illinois there was a conspicuous amount of fluffy floating seed-carriage whatevers being blown across the interstate.  Makes me suspect that the cottonwoods are blooming.  If they are, you should take a walk in the park near where I used to live, on the corner of  urlLink Benton & Mormon Trek .  With the seeds drifting down the place looks like a set from  urlLink Legend . 3.  It's hot as fuck all on the East Coast.  My balls are sweating!  Sorry, but they are.  (No link on this one--)   4.  I must have listened to Pavement's  urlLink "Range Life"  ten times in the last 48 hours.  I love Pavement.  They seem always to be saying, "Be sad, just not too sad.  Also, be excited." 5.  I do miss Iowa.  I also hope it never goes away. 6.  I am in the middle of reading Aleksandar Hemon's  urlLink "The Question of Bruno."   I love it so far.  Two awesome descriptive fourishes that seem recently appropriate and of which I am jealous:  tomato slices at a cookout "sunk in their own slobber"; a TV in a motel room "facing the bed patiently, like a dog waiting for a treat."  (Suspiciously enough, I saw no dogs in Barkeyville.)  Anybody reading anything good lately? 7.  I love you all.  D says hi.  Be good.

      I'm sure I'm not the first one to posit this theory, but it seems to me that America's fondness for disaster and apocalypse movies, such as the about-to-open destruct-o-rama,  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow,  is akin to getting off on being spanked. In other words, as an adolescent nation we sublimate our guilty knowledge that we are too wealthy, too powerful, and eating too big a piece of the world's pie. That repressed knowledge manifests itself in a desire to see our cities flooded by tidal waves, destroyed by earthquakes, invaded by aliens, and the like. We've been a very naughty nation. Ooh, it hurts so good!  One would think that in the Post 9/11 world, this sort of sanctioned, masochistic pleasure-seeking would ebb a bit. For awhile, it seemed to. But I'm guessing Americans will throng to the theaters this weekend, salivating and slightly aroused, to watch America be destroyed (by global warming, no less) in glorious technicolor. The same way we glued ourselves to our TVs for hours on end on 9/11. Did we really need to keep seeing the planes crash into the towers, the people hurling themselves from the windows, the buildings collapsing, again and again? No, but we watched anyway. I did, too. And part of me would love to go to the theater this weekend and see a tidal wave take out Manhattan.  Somehow I suspect that if I were French (or Indian, or Korean, or Polish, or Rwandan, etc.), I wouldn't feel this way. If I were Canadian, I suppose the desire would still be there, but more in a sadistic sort of way. Burn, America! Burn! Come to think of it, I might feel that way if I were French, too. But I digress.

      I just ate at the Lincoln Cafe for the first time, and while we didn't get dessert (we brought our own bright orange Orioles birthday cake), I feel like a dope for not going sooner.  The food was most excellent.  The people were great, and while Ian wasn't working, they all said he was great, too.  The wait staff all had slices of our hideous orange cake and played Graham Parsons on the radio.  Wally the wine-guy from John's was there, and he sent us over a bottle of something good.  The people at the table next to ours ate some cake too, despite the awesome fact that they were BoSox fans.  What a great place.  I like Iowa.  I hope it never goes away.

        In Carroway's Dictionary of Symbols and Their Analysis, the entry for 'hat' includes the desire to protect or keep oneself hidden.  The bottom of the entry said, 'see also beard and armour.'  A cherished hat, however, can sometimes usefully be seen as a soul since it houses the most cherished (symbolically speaking) part of the body.   'Fire' was a four page entry and there was no 'barbecue fire' sub-heading.  Most of the entries have to do with hell, although many were also concerned with the transformative "phoenix" aspect of fire.  Under the aristocratic title of an 'Earl,' Carroway concludes by a process of inverse transference, given an Earl's lofty position in the social milieu, that sometimes the best symbolic translation of 'Earl' can mean 'little buddy.'  The act of 'throwing' something was almost universally seen as a sign of love, eg. rice at a wedding, or a pitch at a ballgame.  The exception here was the throwing of incendiary devices.   Given all of this, if somebody were to have stripped off somebody else's hat and tossed it on a barbecue flame, Carroway's analysis would suggest that a proper symbolic translation of that act would read something like this: Little Buddy, Sorry I put your hat on the barbecue coals last night.  I was attempting to transform our souls in a phoenix-esque manner and burn through the barriers that divided our love -- including drunken inarticulateness.   Glad that's cleared up.

      It probably doesn't take a PhD in dream analysis to interpret the separation anxiety in the dream I am about to relate.  I was in the Uiowa Hopsital when ER style chaos broke out.  All sorts of EMTs raced into the building  with full stretchers.  Then hospital people in blue garb started falling in the operation rooms and corridors.  They moaned theatrically in their dying.  The loudspeaker announced (helpfully) that we should all run for our lives because a virulent case of FATAL strep was on the loose.  Naturally, I ran.  Sadly as I ran, I passed many of my friends from the workshop who were in the process of succumbing to this very virulent strep.  Sucks to be you.  I won't name names other than to say that Chang (sorry Chang) was the first to go -- which makes a kind of pleasing symmetry to my experience here at the workshop but only in a perverse kind of way.  Rest assured that if you're on this blog you were a goner.  In any event, I survived the plague quite nicely thank you, and the next segment of the dream took place in the motherland where milk and honey were mine for the asking.  My advice for you all:  Run for your lives without looking back.  Iowa City is no longer safe.  Not for any of us!

      Most of you probably don't know this, but I am in love with Strong Bad. Who is Strong Bad, you ask? Quite simply, he is the awesomest guy in StrongBadia. To meet him, and see why Strong Bad has my heart, you must visit  urlLink wwww.homestarrunner.com  and check out the emails to Strong Bad. (Especially recommended: Dragon, English Paper, and Japanese Cartoon)  Strong Bad's own animated series, "Teen Girl Squad" (under 'toons,') is also highly recommended, and will give you further insight into the sensitive, mysterious, macho man that Strong Bad is. If not for Strong Bad -- and, in fact, the whole Homestarrunner gang -- I would be a much more productive and prolific writer than I am. And I thank them for that.

      I was thinking about yesterday's strange and lovely little graduation ceremony and how nice it was to have a graduation be so personal and funny. And then I was thinking, I wonder if we appeared to be a bunch of assholes to the outsiders there. You know -- a bunch of smug, self-satisfied, wise asses. And I thought: yes, probably. And I realized that it was the first time in a long while that I've felt on the inside of an incidence of smug wise-assedness rather than on the outside, looking scornfully in. And I have to say, I rather liked it. Does this make me a bad person? Please advise.

      I hate to have to break the news to you, Pete, but Troy was a stinker.  Bad dialogue, confusing action, all moneyshots and silly close-ups.  Like a porno without the penises.  I was bored.  Most suspiciously current exchange: Nestor:  If we leave now we'll lose all credibility in the region. Odysseus:  But if we stay and fight, we should do so for the right reasons. (I'm paraphrasing.  I might have added "in the region," but "credibility" was definitely in there.)  Big Bad Brad's best line:  "Everything is more beautiful because we are doomed."

      Dear Blog Team,  On behalf of all of you, I would like to offer myself a very warm welcome to the blog team!  I have joined the blog team for a variety of reasons which, mostly, are personal and not for you to know.  However at this time, I would like to explain the much debated meaning of the moniker, 'The Granimal.'  I did not choose this name.  This name was chosen for me and recently bestowed upon me by the wisest of the seven-foot Coco's.  That he was able to see into my soul and celebrate my connection to all of creation was really quite astounding.  I had thought my inner animal was well hidden from the rest of you.  In any case, please do not be afraid by the implied hostility in the name 'The Granimal.'  Hostility is a human term and has little meaning for the modern part-man, part-animal.  At this point I would like to thank you all for welcoming me to the blog team and provide you with my most febrile assurances that I will work with harmony and self-control to ensure that the honour of the blog team is at all times reflected in all of my future posts.

      Has anyone dealt with their health insurance for after graduation?  I'm trying to figure this out and wonder if I'm getting the runaround.  It's not clear that COBRA is worth it if you leave IC.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.

      I want to encourage everyone to fill out a profile. If you want to include a photo, image hosting is easy to find for free, and could prove useful for your future posting. I use  urlLink walagata , though they are occasionally frustrating.    That said, there are plenty of other good  urlLink options  out there.

      Last night I proposed marriage to Kristin, and she said, "Yes."  We are engaged.    I suppose this is a venue for sharing thoughts with one another.  I haven't really had time for that, so I'll have to get back to the blog on the matter at a later date.  All I can think at present is: I love this woman.

      Hey guys  I'm concerned, as I hope you all are, with staying in touch after graduation.  This got me thinking that we could start a blog intended mostly for each other.  The reasons to do this are many:  1)  posting on a blog is only slightly more complicated than writing an email, and only so when you want to include a picture or link.  Either way, it only took me about ten minutes to figure it all out.    2)  We can stay in touch together, as a group.  Think of it as a virtual Mill.  I think there's less pressure but more incentive to stay in touch this way.  If there are enough of us, pressure is considerably diluted; no one has to post with any particular frequency.  3)  I will do all the administrative work.  All you have to do is post.   5)  Invite anyone else who you'd think should be involved (and please explain that I didn't email them at first not because I meant to, but because these were the addresses in my contact folder).  6)  If you're unsure, just sign on.  You're not really committing to anything except for future options.    I think this will be great, but only if you guys think it will be great.  Let me know.  I'll get started on it right away, this email will be the first post.

      Thanks in part to last minute pleas by Ralph and Micheal Moore, (and also to the taped comments of a conservative candidate promising to tample on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms regarding gay marriage) the arch forces of evil in my country suffered a temporary set-back last night when the Liberal party was elected to a minority government.  Thanks for all your mental efforts on keeping Canada from the Conservative Jack Boot.  Anyone seen Fahrenheit 911 yet by the way? For Ian's sake I will not be posting riding by riding results for last night's elections.  Happy 25th Pete.  Brace yourself for a year of fantastical spiritual enlightenment.  25 is the year it all comes together.

      Prepare to grillify as I quarter-centurify.  Wednesday night, 7:30, my house (email for the address if you need it).  I'm not sure who is in town and I'm a really lazy inviter, so bring whoever in addition to any meat, beer, processed non-meat, non-processed non-meat, etc, that tickles your fancy.  Needless to say, if you are reading this blog and I don't know you, consider yourself left out.  I don't want any cokehead child molesters showing up unless I know them.

      Here's a poem.   On our way out of the parking ramp a herd of bachelorette-partying secreteries  cross our path like ducklings.  Like ducklings, except when she sees us one grabs her crotche and licks her lips. We make the mistake of eye contact.  Dozens of hands pound on the car.  I think of hail until  One celebrant makes an obscene gesture against my window with an inflatable penis the size of a premature infant.

      Buried in a comments strain, Chang asked: "Where is everybody?  What's everyone doing for the Fourth?"  Sorry, Chang, for the pitiful job at paraphrase.    Well, I wonder, too.  And I'm sure others are curious, so I'm giving the matter its own post with its own comments and saying, "Thanks, Chang, for the great idea."  I'm still in IC with Kristin Hall-soon-to-be-Gilchrist-if-I-play-my-cards-right.  We decided to stay at least another six months but probably a year in order to be married without the stress of new jobs in a new town and etc.  No date yet for the wedding as we must wait for a pastoral change at St. Patrick's.  We're both working for local test scoring syndicates.  I'm blogging, cooking, gardening, reading, and even writing a little.  For the 4th, I'm attending my cousin's wedding in Cedar Rapids.  We had a bachelor party for him on Saturday from which I fully recovered this morning (Tuesday).  Kristin is running in the Alliant Energy 8K Very Early Morning Race before the wedding.  Anyone interested in running or spectating should drop me a line.  There.  My update complete, may we hear from the rest of yous?

      I just got a gmail  urlLink account !  And guess what: other members of this blog maybe eligible too... provided they are cool enough.    Just go to  urlLink www.blogger.com , sign into BAF and if you are eligible, the offer will appear on the right column.  Try it out and let me know.  I have no idea if the offer is to all bloggers, or if there is some requirement beyond basic membership (length of membership, number of posts, etc.)  Who knows.  These things are quite valuable, going for up to $60 on ebay, and  urlLink some people will do almost anything to get one .  For me, the prestige alone is worth keeping.  I so rarely get to be on the cutting edge.  If anyone would like to gmail me, email me at my old address and I'll give you the new one.  Sorry for the paranoia, but who knows where the spammers troll and I have a virgin account to watch over.

      I don't suppose anyone's been following  urlLink this  story, by any chance?  Or  urlLink this ?  The story concerns one of our own, who gave up his literary aspirations in order to get filthy fucking rich, on the backs of thousands of elderly pensioners and mutual fund investors.  Sounds good, no?  I'm thinking the new workshop library should be expanded to include a jacuzzi.  Oh, and our friend the Hurricane should ask for a raise.    Hope all is well with everyone.  Sorry I haven't posted more.  I'll invoke my all-purpose excuse: wedding planning.  Other than that, I've just been kickin' it here in the IC, making desserts, making up for lost time with Nicki, getting my ankle horribly sprained by Alistair Moock, and reading, little by little, Grant's exhaustive history of Canadian electoral politics.

      Our garden is thriving on the south side of town in a park I doubt you knew existed.  You are all invited to peruse the lushness and admire it in comparison to neighboring plots.  The park is called Wetherby and is found at the end of Taylor (just East of Broadway) off of Highway 6.  Our plot is number 6.  When you visit, pull a weed or two from the tomato patch if you find any, would you please?   The veggies growing inside our rabbit fencing have made their homes in little rows and on mounds and in patches.  After some time in the sun, bending close to carrot shoots and reaching beneath nervous-system-like broccoli, I have wished that these little living things actually possessed the voices my imagination attributes to them.  I find it somewhat unbelievable that beautiful food can be so simple.  The work we did and nurture we provided was minimal considering the results.    What’s new in the garden?  The tomatoes are staked, morning glories are planted along the back fence, corn is sprouting, one pepper plant has produced a single pepper, we’ve harvested a few onions and sautéed them for wonderful pasta sauces using the greens of the leaves as well as the onions themselves.  Old news: the rabbit fence continues to protect the lettuces (whose imaginary plant voices resemble your corpulent eldest auntie), fried green tomatoes are anticipated in our kitchen by the end of June, and a neighboring gardener offered praise on the pleasing appearance of our plot.    In other news: I’ve been putting many of your leftovers and left-behinds to rather tasty use.  Upon their moves Tom and Leigh gave me a crock-pot, Grant and Kate a food processor and spices, and someone left in my freezer a package of turkey bratwurst.  In the crock I simmered the turkey brats for hours in two cans of beer with whole cloves of garlic and sprinklings of several other spices.  The tender and flavorful result will never be exactly duplicated, as I don’t record my recipes.    Enough for now?  Probably.  Sorry for my laxity in posting.  I make no promises to be a better blogger, though you may all be assured that I wish I were.

      Please, everyone of us, use single-minded strength of will to make TD join our commune.  Today he should have no choice but to sit down at his computer and register at blogspot -- TD: "Why do I have such a strong desire to sit down at my computer and register at the blogspot?"  Yes that is that is the wish of the Borg.  As for the rest of you non-contributing borgmates, I am the Borgmaster, [not to be confused with Pete who is the Blogmaster] and I command you to write.  Chang, Gillymonster, Possum, Michelle, SER (anyone else?) all of you will feel a strong desire to sit down at your computers and update the baby-borg on your whereabouts and doings -- All: "Why do we feel such a strong desire to sit down at our computers and communicate our whereabouts and doings?"  In order not to be a hypocrite, let the Borgmaster offer this wee update. I'm still stranded in Moose Jaw.  Tomorrow, Calgary.  The day after that, Vancouver.  Kate and I finally found out where we're going to be in Japan, beautiful Hondo City!  It's just off the south eastern coast of Kyushu island on one of the Amakusa islands.  It's a moutainous, coastal city of 40,000 and very rural which I suppose will be like IC without the football players or the hotpants but with a lot more water and moutains.  We like visitors.  Book now with your travel agent.  The rent for our three tatami aptmnt will be CDN $212/month so you might even consider saving up and moving in next door.  Otherwise, I've been doing my best to stay on the right side of Kate's family and to get informed about the upcoming federal election.  Last night was the leaders' french langauge debate on tv.  This is quite a comic event as none of the leaders speaks french fluently.  This kind of french is my kind of french.  Bonjour tout le monde.  Je m'appele Jack Layton et je voudrais etre le "Prime Minister" de Canada.  Tonight is the English language debate.  Those Blogmates with satellite tv should prepare yourselves for a real treat.  At the moment, it looks as though there will be a conservative party majority -- the conservatives are planning to spend more on the military, Americanize health-care, ban abortion, and make gay unions illegal, not to mention getting tough on crime and drugs.  Anyone who told me you'd move to Canada if Bush got in again, please use your impressive powers of mental control to elect the NDP or Greens.  Canadians: "Why do we feels an overpowering urge to vote for NDP or Green?"  If the conservatives win, plan on on staying where you are for the next 1-5 yrs.  This is an interesting election year since the less powerful parties are showing well in the polls and are expected to split the vote on the left.  There are five contenders.  In addition to the Conservatives there are the liberals who have been in power for the past forever and who presided over the country's biggest ever $ scandal which has been coming to light over the past year; the Bloc Quebecois whose single goal is to dismantle the federation (they only run candidates in Quebec);  the NDP who are very left and who I wish would win a majority but will happen when pigs fly; and the ever likable Greens.  I'm hoping for a minority government situation where there's a coalition between the liberals and the NDP.  The liberals need to be punished for their corruption and an NDP government by itself would likely get us invaded by a re-elected Bush.  So far since coming home my polictical highlight has been when longterm NDP MP (Member of Parliament)Svend Robinson stepped down after stealing a $50,000 necklace at an auction.  He turned himself in to the police the next day when he couldn't get in touch with the auction house which was closed for the weekend.  Miss you all.

      Would anyone still in IC be comfortable giving me a trim around the ears?  It shouldn't require too much skill, but A is unduly worried about messing it up.  Oh yeah- we're back.  Still jetlagging, but if there's anything going on tomorrow night, let us know.

      Last night, Alastair and I watched "Grease," which is on TV basically every day on one channel or another, on the Women's Entertainment Network, AKA "We." The little animation that came up before and after commercial breaks referred to the showing of the film as "Cinematherapy."  This set me off on a little rant about how insipid and unfeminist and annoying the current women's self-help / psychobabble / Oprahfied /Bridget Jones pop culture is, and how infantilizing I find it to constantly be told to "go girl!" and "get self-actualized" (what does that  mean ?) and eat ice cream and burn scented candles when I'm feeling victimized by men/work/my weight/etc. (As for personality quizzes, don't even get me started...)  So then there was a commercial for a show called "Bridezillas" which seems to be about bitchy real-life brides who throw tantrums when the cocktail napkins for their reception are the wrong shade of Ecru, thus ruining the wedding they've dreamed of all their lives. (Jane rants some more, while patient, long-suffering Alastair goes and gets another beer.)  But this was the best part: the voice over said, "That's tomorrow night, on WE."  On We.  On We.  On We.  Say it three times fast....YES. Exactly. Coincidence? I think not.  I rest my case.

      Can somebody explain the IRC system to me?  I tried to purchase a couple at the local post office today and the woman said I needed to know exactly how much it costs to send a letter from the other country.  This does not sound true to me.  I suspect that she didn't like the look of me.

      My DSL is finally operative, and so, as promised, more items of possible interest: 1.  How glad was I to hear yesterday that Verizon's grip on the teletech industry will only become tighter in the years to come?  Not so glad.  They needed a month of lead-in time to move our phone line, and still they were late with it.  We didn't even change our phone number! 2.  Have you heard the new joint from the roots?  damn that shit is hot.  East.  Coast. 3.  Ryan also just sent me "Lifted or..." by Bright Eyes.  Track 2's pretty great. 4.  Did anyone read the article about the giant squids in the New Yorker a couple weeks ago?  I read it last night.  I bet they're smarter than we think they are.  They're like giant brains floating around in the ocean, and  hiding from us.  Spooky.  Henrick Herzberg especially. 5.  Speaking of giant brains, has anyone read Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris"?  I really liked it.  A few months ago I watched Tarkovsky's adaptation and thought it was decent.  Word on the street is that when Lem saw Soderberg's version he took back everything bad he'd ever said about Tarkovsky. 6.  Shrek 2 was fun.  Puss in boots, yes.  I also recently watched and loved Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train." 7.  I just read a bunch of stories by Peter Taylor.  He was a monster of a writer!  How come I've never heard of this guy. 8.  So 7 was a veiled plea for recommendations and brief reviews.  It's one thing the lot of us are good for, for God's sake.  9.  I'm getting carried away, though.  In the future I promise not to post as many of my own. 10.  Have I mentioned that my apartment came with a piano? 11.  Rob Neyer's column on ESPN.com is no longer free.  Bastards!  My baseball IQ just plummeted.  12.  Reagan had a teabag coming to him that never got administered.  And that's the last that I'll say about all that.     Toodles-

      When the news of Reagan's passing came, I was reminded of his re-election bid in 1984 when my parents took me and my brother to see him speak at a rally at our town hall in (mostly Republican) Fairfield, Connecticut. I was nine or ten, and boy, was I excited.   My brother and I waved our flags and cheered "Four more Years!" We jeered the Mondale supporters and liked the Republicans with the "Fritz Busters" signs (Mondale's face fashioned into the Ghostbusters logo). We made our parents rush us down the street afterward so we could wave to his limo as it passed.   Why this outpouring of GOP enthusiasm from two tykes such as ourselves, raised on PBS and whole wheat bread? Well, he was the PRESIDENT!! What did we care if he was funding the slaughter of villagers in Guatemala? Nuclear proliferation? What's that? Iran-Contra huh? He liked Jellybeans and we wished our grandpa was more like him. We didn't care what our parents thought about him -- we didn't even know! (I have since learned that my father voted for him both times, something I like to give him shit about when he spews venom over George W. and sends checks to Kerry.)  What is my point? Oh, I don't know. I guess just this: if you see cute little kids on TV in the next few months' campaign coverage, cheering for Shrub, don't judge them too harshly or take them too seriously. They may turn out to be card-carrying, bleeding heart, pinko liberals like me. As for the kids cheering for Kerry -- well, let's hope they turn out that way too.

       No, it isn'the chocolate, or the bread, or the cosmopolitan attitudes.   It's the preponderance of swords, maces, plate mail and other pre-modern instruments of death/death avoidance.  In America, you only see these things on the cover of heavy metal LPs and inside Dungeons and Dragons manuals.    As a lifelong purveyor of both heavy metal LPs and Dungeons and Dragons manuals, I feel like I'm coming home for the first time.  I'm telling you; this shit is everywhere.  I almost bought a turkish sabre in budapest flea market but I thought better of carrying it around for a couple weeks, let alone across a few borders.    Today, in a castle, we saw a set of scale mail with fucking wings on the back.  Truly. It had feathers and everything.  Bad ass.  You could put Jerry Lewis in there and I wouldn't fuck with him.      We'll be back next week.  I hope everyone is well.

      So I just got back this week from my 10th reunion at Princeton (that experience may be worth a different posting, once I've sorted out my complex feelings of nostalgia with Tom Derr, who has a doctorate in the subject - could someone force him to join this blog, please?).  I also saw the article in the NYTimes a couple of days ago about the Princeton senior who did an analysis of short stories in the New Yorker for her Operations Research thesis ( urlLink article here  ).  These two things reminded me that you can go onto a Princeton website and look up anyone's senior thesis.  Here are just a few:  Donald Rumsfeld '54: The Steel Seizure Case of 1952 and Its Effects on Presidential Powers (Politics) Brooke Shields '87: The Initiation: From Innocence to Experience: The Pre-Adolescent/Adolescent Journey in the Films of Louis Malle, "Pretty Baby" and "Lacombe Lucien" (Romance Languages and Literatures)  Jonathan Safran Foer '99: Before Reading The Book of Antecedents: Intention, Literary Interpretation, and the Hypothesized Author (Philosophy)  More  urlLink here .  Rummy was on campus for his 50th reunion, incidentally, although I never saw him.  I did see a guy I know from the class of '54, who's been married 5 times and told me that Rummy was "the best man at his worst wedding."  I did not investigate further.    Another amusing  urlLink time-waster :  Find out which candidates your neighbors are supporting!  (Edit:  Added Hyperlinks.  PC)

      Hi All,  Kate and I made it back safely to MJ around two this morning.  About thirty minutes out of IC we drove straight through the wickedest storm I've ever seen.  I looked over at Kate and said, "Do you think this is a fucking Tornado we're driving through?"  It looked like nuke-u-ler winter outside.  The only colour I remember was grey.  That's when we tuned the radio to an Emergency Broadcast Beep and a man saying a Tornado was touching down within miles of Vinton and that if you were in the area, you were to seek immediate shelter behind concrete walls.  Go little Ford Escort Go!  And it did.  We ran into a Pizza Hut yelling Tornado! Tornado!  The people there just looked up at us and kept on feeding.  We hung out for a while until the T-advisory was let down then made our way home.  The advisory said Iowa City itself might see some action.  Did it?  I hope everyone keeps on posting, because I'm feeling sad to have left Iowa.

      Should I become a postman?  I'd have to give up Cheeba because they  definitely  drug test, and philosophical objections, gallons of water and internet miracle flushes aside, it would likely be many months of ascetic self-denial before I could even  seriously consider taking the civil service exam.  But the pay is  good, and I could grow that handle-bar moustache I've always wanted.    Unrelatedly, I'm glad and mildy self-consciousthat in my two-week absence everyone has been posting so much.   I guess I was smothering you guys.    Chicago is great.  I'll write more about that later.  If anyone wants to pick up some impeccable slack until I have my own internet access, please let me know.   Then again, at this point, I've probably lost all my readers anyway.    Barrack Obama is my new hero.   I know Kerry has adopted Langston Hughes's line, "Let America Be America Again," but watching this badass speak, the better line seemed to be "Let the Democrats be the Democrats again; the party they never were."    Did anyone else catch David Brooks's comparison of Obama to Tiger Woods?  What an ass.  Whenever I see him on Jim Lehrer, he talks like he's fighting back the self-conscious and bitter tears of a playground victim.       I'll see some of you in Philly.  If anyone wants to come see Modest Mouse and Deathcab for cutie in Chicago on August 14, you can stay with me.

      &nbsp; I finally had the chance to go into downtown Boston yesterday and soak up a little bit of DNC hubub. The city was decidedly abuzz. Secret service, cops, and&nbsp;troopers&nbsp;everywhere. But no major traffic snarls or chaos. Actually, it was all quite festive (machine guns aside).  I had two "celebrity" sightings: Dick Gephart and Mike Dukakis. Both were just walking down the street with one or two other people and I did double takes both times. Not exactly John Cusack or Matt Damon (both also in town for the occasion), and definitely not Jon Stewart, but at least I got a little bit of that goofy frisson that comes with spotting someone famous. I also waited for about fifteen minutes in front of an outdoor&nbsp;restaurant in Quincy Market (a place nobody from Boston ever goes, incidentally) because there was a rumor that Bill and Hillary were coming. They didn't show, but I chatted with a congressman from Georgia who pointed out a number of senators and congressman in the restaurant, some of whom looked familiar.  Otherwise, there were lots of people with big plastic DNC tags hanging around their necks (Delegates, I presume) and lots of flair all over their shirts. ("Office Space" fans will know what I mean.) There were some small coteries of protesters, most for left-leaning causes, a big group of Falun Gong-ers,&nbsp;plus the requisite pro-lifers with bloody fetus posters. What I found most fascinating were the lone ranging activists -- just individual people carrying around signs or passing out fliers.   Sadly, I was unable to join the Billionaires for Bush march as my alter ego, Mimi Furst, due to the fact that I&nbsp;am overloaded with work for my CTY course (incidentally, did anyone read the 'Nerd Camp' article in last week's NYer? That's the same&nbsp;organization I'm working for).   Did anyone catch Clinton's speech on Monday night? Man, that guy can talk. But Barack Obama, the Justin Timberlake of the Democratic Party, is one helluva rhetorician himself.   I don't know. Can we win this thing? I am envious of all you folks who get to vote in Iowa and actually have an impact. Voting Dem. in Massachusetts is like spitting into the ocean. (Another thing I plan to do, soon.)  Over and out.  &nbsp;

      I read this blog a lot, but I don't write on it much.&nbsp; My life, you know, is sort of mundane.&nbsp; But, I have some bad news, and since Fern was the most perfect dog ever (sorry Lucy, Annie, Harvey, et al) I had to let the world know, in at least this small way, that she is gone.&nbsp; She started having seizures one day on our afternoon walk, and after four days at the emergency vet's office, in and out of consciousness, she came home with me.&nbsp; She died under an elm tree on Summit Street, very peacefully, and we buried her out at Jan's (Jan at the Workshop) farm near Solon.&nbsp;   It's been over a week now, and I'm past the stage of being sad and lonely and tearful and sort of angry, although I still think I see her on the couch when I come home at night.&nbsp;   God.&nbsp; What a great dog she was.   Okay.&nbsp; Remember when I said I'm past that bad stage?&nbsp; I guess that was a lie.&nbsp; But I thought you all should know, since you all met her at some point, and experienced that big, mellow head pressed against your knee.

      Lo for the settling of&nbsp;the righteouserness&nbsp;between Philly&nbsp;or Boston,&nbsp;for the unwinding of the&nbsp;stand-offing between Austin and IC, for the Kerry versus Bushing, and the driving&nbsp;of cars with tanks of fat-fry grease, MJ will descend like an angel descending to make peace&nbsp;amongst the Americanites.  Donought&nbsp;of the&nbsp;sky at night,&nbsp;the peace she brings&nbsp;will be&nbsp;infinite, dusted in sprinkles.  Enough cleverality/stupidiatlity,&nbsp;I too have not posted much recently to the Blog of Blogs and will deign to do so now.  Kate and I are readying ourselves for Japan.&nbsp; She leaves in a week, I the week after.&nbsp; We've been catching up with friends and their children over the past few weeks.&nbsp; Why is it that whenever you leave a&nbsp;friend alone for two or more years, they reappear with three or more children?&nbsp; Anyone on this blog with fertility issues wanting fecundity, should just make sure to check in with me&nbsp;after May 2006.  Actually, it might be easier to go back to being clever now that I realize I don't have all that much to say.&nbsp; I could pretend that I've been losing myself in rereading both the Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon series but such would just be useless cleverness.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have finally been reading William T. Vollman's The Royal Family -- which was on the remainder table at Prairie Lights.&nbsp; He's a strange writer.&nbsp; When I read him,&nbsp;the little Offut/Ethan on my shoulder cry foul&nbsp;(pleasurable in and of itself).&nbsp; Economy of word is not Vollman's gift but his general sense of over the top has always been mesmerizing.&nbsp; Does anyone else have thoughts on Vollman.&nbsp; I kept telling Derr to read him while in IC.&nbsp; Now I'm not so certain.  I probably could write a long passage on the meaning of home, that's what I've been thinking about lately -- as my sense of America&nbsp;(and my involvement in her politics)&nbsp;recedes and is replaced&nbsp;with time in&nbsp;my default landscape (cedars, hemlock, and firs)&nbsp;-- but I won't bore you&nbsp;all with the details.  Anyway,&nbsp;a question to end, does anyone on the blog have the authority to invite people to g-mail.&nbsp; If so, think fondly of me since I'd like never again to delete another email.  Hope everyone's doing well.&nbsp;

      &nbsp; I've been remiss in posting for a good while now due to the tumult and exhaustion of moving. But here we are, back in the greater Boston metropolitan area, and here I am, back on the blog. Mostly, both big&nbsp;Al and I are suprememely&nbsp;disoriented and tired and discombobulated. But slowly, the reality that this is our home is sinking in. A few observations: &nbsp; I went for a walk at dusk last night&nbsp;and caught a whiff of subtley but distinctively salt-water-scented air. That was nice.&nbsp; Not that I have anything against the smell of manure, but, you know. &nbsp; There are a lot more Kerry than Bush bumper stickers on cars here. But a lot more cars in general, and they move a helluva lot faster and more frantically. &nbsp; A much larger percentage of the young&nbsp;women around town -- and this I find especially comforting after two years of being surrounded by spray-on-tan, midriff-baring,&nbsp;bottle-blonde&nbsp;Iowa&nbsp;undergrads -- are curvy and pale and wear cool&nbsp;clothes.&nbsp;Less makeup, too.&nbsp;(Foundation? What's that?) &nbsp; Our car insurance is going to cost us twice as much. Mother fuck. &nbsp; I can hear church bells from our house when the windows are open. &nbsp; I miss our herb garden, and all the blue jays and cardinals in&nbsp;our old&nbsp;backyard. But I really like being able to get good&nbsp;takeout&nbsp;Indian food, which we had the other night. &nbsp; I miss all of you guys, but I'm sure as hell glad not to be in the Workshop anymore.  &nbsp; In any case, we have an absurdly huge apartment, so please let us know if you're ever nearby and need a place to crash. (That goes for you, too, FBI guy....) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       Dear Iowa Mafia,  I am sponsoring an essay contest.   You are all strongly encouraged to participate.   First prize is a cash award of a presently undisclosed amount.   The contest rules are as follows.   Well, before I get to those, I’ll give you a little history, a little background, implicit in which the aforementioned contest rules may, or might, be.  When I asked Frank Conroy to write me a letter of recommendation, he said he would be pleased to do so, wholeheartedly and without reservation.   However, there was, or is, what I perceive to be a catch.   He said that he is, in any case, pleased to write any graduate of the Workshop a letter of recommendation because the level of discourse at Iowa is of an order of magnitude to ipso facto warrant one, but that (and here’s the perceived catch) the student himself must write the letter.   That is, I write the letter, send it to him, he laughs, edits, files it away. It turns out, however, that I am too self-loathing to recommend myself, let alone to assume the voice of Conroy in the doing so.   The letter, Frank said, is nothing more than a form letter, one that should (or perhaps he said “could”) end with: I recommend….wholeheartedly and without reservation.  &nbsp;  In fairness to Pete, I asked him to write this letter for me, and he said he’d be pleased to do so, wholeheartedly and without reservation, but that was weeks ago, and Pete, by his own admission, is an out-of-sight-out-of-mind sort of guy, a poor corresponder, and calls to mind a passage from Proust:   “The process which had begun in [Pete] – and in [him] a little earlier only than it must come to all of us – was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world.”  &nbsp;  I suppose it’s possible no one will when this esteemed contest, but I hope that’s not the case.   I encourage collaboration and plagiarism, and should it be the case that I end out using not a single essay but a combination of essays, bits and pieces from here or there, I will divide the amount of the currently undisclosed cash award by the number of words in the final eclectism, and pay each author on a wordly basis.  For you organized thinkers out there (Sarah, Michelle) we're talking three or four minutes of effort.   But, I understand, wholeheartedly, that people have other shit to do.  I wish you all the best of luck in this prestigious contest.   And remember that, given the level of discourse, you’re all winners to me.  Cheers,  Thomas E. Derr, Olympic Hopeful        &nbsp;

      Has anyone else seen  urlLink this contest  advertised in Vanity Fair?&nbsp; I saw it in the issue that has David Beckham on the cover and a mustachioed Tom DeLay in its inner pages.&nbsp; For those too lazy to link through, it's for $15,000 and a trip to an Italian writers' colony (not to be confused with an Italian-writers' colony), the deadline is July 31, and you have to explain the character of the American people (such as it is) to the rest of the world in 1,500 words.&nbsp; Submissions are via email.&nbsp;   Montblanc is sponsoring it, perhaps as some sort of feint at improving Franco-American relations in the wake of the Freedom-Fries spasm.&nbsp; Judging, alas, is blind, so the staffers at Vanity Fair can't be impressed by our Workshop credentials, only by the meaning, sense, and clarity of our sentences (and perhaps not even then).

      Due to the sudden influx of high school children in my life, both wanna-be writers and wanna-be lawyers (interesting sidenote--wanna-be writers infinitely more mature than wanna-be lawyers), time to post has been limited.&nbsp; And the imagination hasn't been working properly either, which spells doom for a certain as-yet-unwritten novel. &nbsp; Re the latter, I query you, my blog-reading friends: I'm curious to know, now that you're full-fledged denizens of the blogosphere--what blogs are you reading?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; What is it that draws you to a blog in the first place, and what keeps you there?&nbsp; Trust me when I say this is a more important question than it sounds, at least for me. &nbsp; Here's the bonus: Paul Ingram, of Prairie Lights fame, has started a blog, so those of you no longer in Iowa who are still looking for recommendations need look no further.&nbsp; Here's the link:  urlLink http://misternouse.blogspot.com .&nbsp; Enjoy!

      Just kidding.&nbsp; I have nothing to say about Martha or her corporation; I just like saying "Omnimedia."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, though, it was a little weird that she plugged her magazines and products in her post-sentencing remarks.&nbsp; In any case, I just wanted to say hello to all of you and give you a tedious update.&nbsp; I am pleased to see that Derrcules has joined the blog, but has he posted?&nbsp; Are the Grranimal and Kate in Japan (or, should I say, Nihon de)?  &nbsp;  I have forgiven Blogspot for getting a Trojan Horse onto my computer from a malevolently altered pop-up ad.&nbsp; Actually, I'm still a little mad, but the allure of your witty remarks was too potent.&nbsp;   Anyhoo, here are a few things:  &nbsp;  1. I have been going to lots of weddings in California.&nbsp; This has adversely affected my finances, although this impact is less severe than the negative financial impact of actually getting married yourself, not that my finances have recovered from getting married, but at least I'm not&nbsp;getting married more than once this year or, ideally, in any future year or, really ideally, not ever again.  &nbsp;  2.&nbsp;I have long thought that conspiracy theorists give too much credit to the alleged conspirators by believing that they are actually both crafty and organized enough to execute something complicated, and that collusion is more likely to occur after something shifty has occurred.&nbsp; That having been said, I find myself these days convinced that the Bush Administration is stage-managing intricate conspiracies at all times.&nbsp; I totally buy this current rumor that Bush will dump Cheney late in the game (for health or other reasons) and replace him with someone more palatable, thereby&nbsp;ensuring a victory.&nbsp; I can only hope that McCain and Powell hate W enough that they'd never go for it.&nbsp; In any case, I can't decide if I'm losing it and will soon be setting up a card table with pamphlets and diagrams&nbsp;on the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, or if our current President and his cronies are actually this clever after all&nbsp;and are managing to set in motion such plots while also managing to escape the notice of most people.  &nbsp;  3. The Terrapin in Iowa City has shut down, but apparently the overcaffeinated owners won't admit it and keep telling people that it's "closed for remodeling," when, in fact, it's deader than a peeled egg.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was away, but I heard that an article appeared over the weekend in one of the papers, and, in it, the brothers contended that they were bought out or something because the landlord had received an offer he couldn't refuse.&nbsp; It's all strange.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  4. There was a shooting in the Red Light District!&nbsp; A clerk at the Adult Marketplace was shot by a robber, but he's alive and they caught the dude who did the shooting.&nbsp; In other Iowa news, some farmer near Pella was arrested for growing loads of poppies in the rows in between vegetables.&nbsp; Perhaps he can lend his business savvy to the owners of the Terrapin.  &nbsp;  5.&nbsp; Back to politics.&nbsp; Are all you people registered to vote?&nbsp; Are you volunteering with your local Democratic parties?&nbsp; Are you giving money - even a pittance - to campaigns?&nbsp; I really hope so.&nbsp; Anyone in the Boston or NYC areas, incidentally, should check out the upcoming marches by Billionaires for Bush at  urlLink www.billionairesforbush.com .&nbsp; They're also doing a limo tour through the swing states, and will be at the Iowa State Fair on August 18.  &nbsp;  6.&nbsp;This summer, I have read Motherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Lethem (good, but not as good as I'd expected based on what people had told me - it may just be a case of disappointment due to inflated expectations), Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh (loved it), Little Children by Tom Perrotta (enjoyable but ultimately sort of light, even though there were nicely surprising observations sprinkled throughout - I just can't remember any of them after completing it), and The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon (felt sort of like some of the odd dreams - and now conspiracy theories - I have).&nbsp; I am about to embark upon another Waugh novel, Scoop.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  7.&nbsp; But no one reads else&nbsp;anymore.&nbsp; What are we to do?&nbsp;   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/weekinreview/11mcgr.html?ex=1090641600&amp;en=48072a44fb858d95&amp;ei=5006&amp;partner=ALTAVISTA1   &nbsp;  Your pal,  SER

      This morning I finished Middlemarch, and man oh man was I not disappointed.  How much did I want Dorothea and Lydgate to be real people?  This much.  (Imagine a gesture indicative of vast hugeness.)  Good God, I was so deeply moved so often that I find it hard to talk about.  5 stars from this reviewer.  It's a book about idealisim, ultimately, I think.  Why it is dangerous and necessary and problematic, etc.  Does a good job of undercutting (and sometimes fulfilling) romantic expectations to that end.  It was just so complex and real, despite the stuffy strangeness of that world.  Anyway, enough about that.  I started Breece Pancake's collection this afternoon.  I thought Jim's introduction was very good.  I also just watched The Barbarian Invasions, which I liked a lot.  Made me cry, but I'm a sucker.  And a question--how is one supposed to care for copper pots?  Anybody?  (Chang?)  D and I were given a set at her bridal shower.  They're copper outside, stainless inside, with an aluminum core.  I've gotten them all spotty already, and D left one on a hot burner, which caused the copper to sort of blister.  Is that normal?  I'll leave you all with one of my favorite lines from Middlemarch (from p. 686, in the Finale):  "He once called her his basil plant; and when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man's brains."  Anyway, it's much more devastating in context.  PS--Our basil is doing very well, thankyou.

      The  urlLink big city folks  make IC seem a lot more interesting than it really is.  (Rock on with the mention of the Lincoln, though).   Now that we've (sort of) moved on: do you guys really like this place?  The workshop experience and the people aside,  I kinda fucking hate it.  The problem is not the midwest-- I lived in Madison for four years and loved it-- it isn't even  urlLink Herky , though I wouldn't really mind if that mangy vulture were  urlLink murdered in a ritual fashion .    The real problem is  urlLink Coralville .  The problem is TWO enormous but horrible china buffets across the street from one another, the mini-mall of America, the fact that a town was basically invented to house fast food restaurants, shitty hotels for visiting college athletes, landlord offices and strip clubs that are difficult to locate.  (Not to mention the most evil dog-trainer I have ever met.)  Sometimes I wonder if Coralville was modelled after a level of Purgatory, the particular place you go for driving like a jerk, or for masturbating too much.     Maybe I'm overreacting, but when I think about Coralville too much, I get depressed.  And this isn't a leftist, elitist, whateverist rant.  it just depresses me.  Everything that is wrong with Coralville is everything that is wrong with this country, this world, and me.  If I ever write a manifesto, Coralville will be of central and metaphorical significance.

      I started  urlLink Natasha  yesterday.  I've read  two stories and both were great.  I know a  urlLink lot  of  urlLink reviews  have compared Bezmozgis to Isaac Babel, and even though this is just the sort of comparison that annoys the hell out of me, like I'm buying a brand or something, it's actually pretty accurate.  I like Babel, I like Bezmozgis, though the latter's tendency to write about stoned ethnics and their dogs is troubling to me on a personal level.  I never thought someone would beat me to the market with  that  subject matter.  Fucker.

      Are you asking or quizzing?  If it's the latter, then I've cheated.  I googled the phrase and found that it comes from Sir Thomas Browne's   urlLink Hydriotaphia  , or  Urn Burial ,or,  a Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns Lately Found in Norfolk .  It looks like good stuff.  As for this Uriel, a google search turned up  urlLink this Eurasian mountain mammal  that looks to be something between a deer and a ram.   urlLink Here is an encyclopedia article on the horned bastards .  That said, the passage does seem to indicate Urial is a single person, as far as that goes, all I could find was  urlLink a klezmer musician  and  a lethally injected  urlLink murderer  in TX, both post-dating Elliot by many many years.    Anyone else have any ideas?  This is fun.

      More items: 1.  I am noticing that Derrcules has bumped Hurricane Earle from the top of the pile.  I am not amused.  But in other news, Derrcules--where have you been all my life?  Can you make my computer go faster? 2.  Since last we spoke I saw Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes, which I very much enjoyed.  At first I thought the premise was cheesy and overly-mannered, but by about a third of the way through I was thoroughly won over.  Jarmusch has a wonderful sense of humor, I think.  The scene with Bill Murray was off the hook!  I also watched Down By Law, which I liked, although I do get tired of Roberto Benigni pretty quickly.  Possibly an explanation for my resistance to C & C? 3.  Of course I also saw The Chronicles of Riddick.  Don't ask. 4.  Is the numbered posting getting old?  I think I'll stop with it after this post. The little Offutt who dances on my shoulder is telling me it's just an excuse not to write the transitions. 5.  My herbs are going strong.  The basil is a big bully.  Will have to be isolated.  I planted tomatoes and peppers, too, but the sociopathic squirrel in my backyard (it's the one who fell out of the tree, I am certain) uprooted and ate all four of them.  Seriously, I caught him in the act--I walked out to my kitchen in the morning just in time to see him leap from my rail with leaves and stems and a dirty ganglion of roots all spilling from his little mouth.  The little guy looked too ridiculous to make me angry.  (OK, I got a little angry.) 6.  Michelle, Middlemarch is tremendous.  I have had my socks knocked off on every page.  She's continually expanding on our understanding of her characters without ever seeming inconsistent or reticent--they're all just interesting and complex enough to warrant the attention.  I've seen her even give five pages of exposition on a character she'd thoroughly introduced two hundred pages earlier.  Awesome!  She also makes these hilarious and compassionate authorial asides.  Anyways, I like it.  Here's a section I've been saving for blog (from Chapter 41, p. 340 in my edition):      "Who shall tell me what may be the effect of writing?  If it happens to have been cut in stone, though it lie face downmost for ages on a forsaken beach, or 'rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many conquests', it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and other scandals gossiped about long empires ago:--this world being apparently a huge whispering-gallery.  As the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe.  To Uriel watching the progress of planetary history from the Sun, the one result would be just as much a coincidence as the other."  Anyways, I'll give the final word when I've finished it.  Extra credit to anyone who can 1. identify whom she is quoting in line 3; and 2. tell me who this Uriel is.  (You see, I even think in numeric sequences.)

      Anyone want to read the same book and talk about it on the blog?  It needn't be a "club" per se, because it doesn't matter if we all do it.  But I was thinking: I miss the  urlLink spiritual guidance ,  urlLink the softspoken wisdom , and the  urlLink incisive wit  that I enjoyed/was compelled to sit through every Tuesday afternoon for the last two years.    Some books I will selfishly suggest because I've been meaning to read them:  St. Augustine's Pigeon (Evan S. Connell) The Iliad (Homer) Mickellson's Ghost (John Gardner) Turn of the Screw (DH Lawrence) Death Comes For the Archbishop (Willa Cather) Natasha (David Bezmozgis)  Or, you know, whatever.  I say we keep it informal:  Whoever wants to makes an effort to read whatever book we agree on and then posts on it when they feel compelled to.  Let me know if you're interested; I'll be happy to do whatever work needs to be done here.

      The Cedar Rapids Kernels play at home this Sunday, July 4, at 5 pm. The big Moock and I will be there, in the lawn seating area, eating brats and drinking beer. (It's a small area -- you'll find us.) Tickets for the lawn are only $5 and can be purchased at the door. (We went last year on the 4th, and it wasn't close to being sold out.)   After the game there are fireworks, but there's some serious lag time between when the game ends and the 'works begin, unfortunately. So, bring a book, your knitting, your conversational prowess, etc.  If you haven't been to a Kernels game yet during your Iowa sojourn, this is something you absolutely must do!! The mascot is a big gray (?) kernal of corn. And if that ain't enough to get you there, what is?  Hope to see you there. We can give 2 people a ride, if there are any takers. If you need directions or info, see the  urlLink Kernels' Website .

      I need a reference, for  urlLink this place .  Preferably this would be from someone who knows (and likes) my writing as well as my criticism and maybe even my teaching.  All you need to do is be ready to field a phone call.  If it helps, think of it as serving as my "lifeline" on "Who Wants to Teach a Workshop?"   Also, I need advice.  They want me to write a proposal for a "targeted workshop" on an aspect of fiction writing like dialogue, character, etc.  That's not so hard.  What's hard is they want me to indicated my "requested fees."  What's reasonable for something like this? Their courses are small (about 8-12 students), run for about 8 weeks, and cost the student between $200 and $400 ( It appears I have some input on what the amount would be for my course).  So what percentage should I be asking for?  I really have no idea.

      Sarah's right to give me a hard time for not posting.  I've been devoting most of my blogging time to  urlLink Impeccable Jones  lately, trying to salvage whatever few readers didn't give up on me during my monthlong absence from the interpoo.  Earle's wedding was fantastic.  He and Denise looked great and couldn't stop smiling all night.  The vibes were so positive that A even got me to dance with her.   It was good to see those of you who were there and it's too bad we couldn't all go.    Remember my huge, red Chevy?  It's dead.  I gave her to charity and as I saw the dude tow her away, I was reminded of my boyhood dog, Corky.  That salty bastard survived testicular cancer, diabetes and all the abuse that accompanied symbolizing my family's dysfunction.  In the end it only took simple, inexplicable old age to kill him.  The same goes for the car.  A's uncle hooked that car up to every computer he had.  He even broke out a chemistry set.  After tightening every gear and lubing every part in need of lube, he couldn't find anything wrong with it.  We drove to Chicago thinking our troubles were gone.   We unloaded the fleet of minivans and trucks.  We made a new home for ourselves.  And then, we tried to move the car.  She lurched and stalled, lurched and stalled, all the way up the street until we gave up and pulled over.  I got that car a month before I moved to Iowa and had to give it up three days after I left.  The neat bookends provide some comfort, I guess.   I am reading a good book, though.  Baseball fans, take note:   urlLink Leonard Koppett 's  The Thinking Fan's Guide to Baseball  is a lot of fun.  What C.S. Lewis is to Christianity, this guy is to baseball.  It's sort of like literary criticism in its analysis and argumentation, but you know, not boring.

      Hey-Ho, Yup, kate and I arrived in Japan.  Its sucks neither knowing where to find the apostrophe on a japanese keyboard みor how to communicate even the most basic of ideas to anybody.  This place is a trip.  Its festival season (I guess).  Last night the streets were full of teams of employees dresses in kimonos, power ranger suits, and paramilitary bobble heads, all dancing to souped-up arena-frenzy rock.  Just as soon as we figure out how to look up our local phone company in the phone book, etc Ill be a more regular poster.

      The Scudder Road Circus and Literary Journal (director: P. Morris/animal trainer: T. Moody) has arrived safely in its new home in New Orleans. Apparently, it's inferno-hot here pretty much all the time, and thunderstorms approach from the south and north as well as the west.  The choice of events and activities here is a little overwhelming. Last week, for example, we could choose between a Voodoo Discussion, a Hurricane Preparedness Seminar and the Mermaid Gardens Flea Market & Polka Party. (We went to see the Finn Brothers at the House of Blues last Tuesday, and to White Linen Night, a street party organized by the art galleries in the warehouse district, on Saturday).  When the cable guy is called Claude and the mailman is called Cartier, you know you're not in Iowa City anymore.

      Those who rocked it out on the dirt floored wine-cellars of philly have a moral obligation to dish scoop for FatWhiteGeisha.  FatWhiteGeisha demands his scoop.  My own scoop is infinitely boring.  I pruned the cedar hedge at my mom's yesterday and cleaned the shelves in the garage today.  Tomorrow the bathroom gets a whole lot of lysolid loving.  Good god, what a glorious life.  Saturday FatWhiteGeisha flies.  Scoop please.

      Greetings, everyone.  I've been at another wedding in the San Francisco area.  While there, I went to a Kerry fundraiser, ate Ethiopian food, purchased jeans, and so forth.  Anyway, here is the above-referenced list:  1. I saw no Bush-Cheney bumper stickers in San Francisco, not even one.  I thought I saw one, but on closer inspection, it said "Bush-Orwell." I get the point, but Orwell obviously does not even facetiously belong  on  a totalitarian ticket but rather outside of it, providing prescient commentary.  In any case, I also saw no Nader-Camejo bumper stickers in San Francisco, not even one, which is quite different from 2000.  People in SF are big into making their own political posters and hanging them in their windows for passers-by to see.  Despite the number of stylish graphic-arts types in SF, most of these window displays look as though they were word-processed using some sort of manifesto software and/or on an Apple II-C, and printed on an old-school dot-matrix printer where the paper has strips of those little holes at the edges that hook onto the printer and are later torn off.  2. I saw on IowaBlog that there's a rumor that Frank will retire after this coming year and that the university is in discussions with Jonathan Franzen to come in.  Does anyone know whether this is true?  I assume the same source that told Vu this has told one of you.  Please confirm/deny/discuss/masturbate.  3. The sweet corn here in Iowa is fabulous at present.  4. After having few visitors, aside from my parents, since Feb. 2003, we are receiving no fewer than 7 in the next month.  What the hell?  Perhaps everyone wants to see a battleground state up-close, or maybe they've heard tell of the butter cow.  5. While in SF, apparently, I got a stress fracture in my second metatarsal bone (the long bone that extends down your foot from your second toe), and it's killing me.  I can hardly walk, much less engage in aerobic activity or ass-kicking.  I suspect that some combination of poor foot construction (high arches), the high-heeled shoes I wore to the wedding, and my zipping through various airports with a heavy backpack created this situation.  So watch out, those of you who are similarly aged and whose warranties may be running out!  I hope everyone is doing well, particularly those of you who have recently been married or are soon getting married or are establishing a new life as FatWhiteGeisha.com in Japan.
