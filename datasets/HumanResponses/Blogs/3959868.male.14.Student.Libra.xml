      Anyone have a good day? Well, I had a good day, but a good day doesn't describe how awesome today was. Had a Doctor appointment and then came home. Called Racehl at 4:30 or so and talked to her. That was a good day. What makes to day an awesome day was that I went to then movies with Rachel and her mom. (Her mom wasnt anywhere near) The Bourne Supremecy is what we saw. Great movie. Then when we went to go to the car after the movie, and Rachel tried getting run over. Although, I tried to get hit from a van, so, it evened out. :-P. The we went out to eat. Her mom left us alone and we sat and talked.

      To day was a good day. Boring to begin with. I rode my bike for a few miles. Messed around. Once my sister had gotten off the internet, I about pissed my pants when she told me that Rachel called. SHE WAS HOME. I called her and she was about to leave, but her mom answered and asked if she wanted to talk to me before she left. She did. We talked for a while and then I guess she left for somewhere. Rode my bike around town and saw&nbsp;a cop sitting at my neighbors, so I went spy and started following him.  Zach now happy. Well, as happy as I get.

      Uhhh, well, eeyea. A record boring today. I didnt do crap all day. Rode my bike. Talked to Brian. That made me mad because he reminded me how badly some guy likes Rachel. This guy is..............pisses me off thinking about him. He's done stuff to me in the past. Called one of Rachel's friends to see if she's (the friend) is still mad at me. That would&nbsp;be the 8th time I tried calling. TWO MORE FRICKING DAYS.  Everyone knows what I mean.

      Well, from one of Rachel's friends, I heard from Rachel. It was awkward, but I was glad to hear from her any possible way. She told me that she missed me, but wouldnt beleive me when I told her it back. As I type this, I know that she is the only one  ever  going to read this, but.... I MEANT IT. Hell, I stare at her picture at least twice a day. TUESDAY. Thats the day shes coming back. Thats the day shes going to call me, right? I'm pretty happy with myself. I'm not as much of a stalker as I thought. I mean, I only&nbsp;think about her 7 or 8 times. Let me finish. 7 or 8 times----per minute.

      Boring day. Went to town, my dad got a haircut, went to another town. Went to doctors appointment. Came home. Went to movies(Spider-Man 2). Saw Brian's old girlfriend and friend. I said a few words, flipped them off, and got into the car. Came home. Called Brian and I wanted to call Rachel but she was GONE. I've gotten used to not talking to her because SHES BEEN GONE FOR A WEEK.  Zach sad. (There would be a sad smily in here)

      Yea, today was decent. I played golf to begin with. I suck. 71 on a 36 total par. The supid ball had a fetish for water. I was happy for my ball retreivor I got for Christmas. Kinda fun..... Got home and screwed around for a while. Then I called my girlfriend and talked to her for an hour or so. I'll post more stuff about her when she forgets about this journal. ALL GOOD STUFF. Made homemade ice cream with my family. Relatively fun. Better to eat. Had a cat molest my leg. My sister beat me up with a bag of magazines. Ok, so she swung it at me for annoying her and hit me square in the gut. It didn't hurt suprisingly, but I was hungry afterwards...... Then I listened to music on got on here talking Brian and Rachel(gf).

      Change of mind. I'm posting about Rachel anyways. The every-day girl. Normal as any other. Who am I kidding? I wouldn't like her if she was normal. She tells me that she's unpopular--good thing--but I don't understand why. Yea, we go to different schools. I have to say at least this about her: She has a beautiful body, but she has a mind just as beautiful. About 5'3"(good thing because I'm 6'2"). Brownish eyes, black hair. The perfect face. Shes not a prep and shes not Gothic. I honestly dont know where she is. I dont care either really. As long we both hate preps, its all good. She almost has a lower self-esteem than me, but if she wants it to be, she has a lot of work to do. She's trying to kill me with all of the compliments she gives me. I could guarantee they're lies in my point of view. She disagrees. Iunno

      I'm writing a book. Its odd, but it gives me something to do. I was going gung-ho on it, but things have gotten complicated. Tried something again, bad idea. Got in trouble. It wasnt a drug you hypocrites. Worse than drugs. No big deal. I'm alive and doing my best to put up with it. The book is complete sci-fi. Hell, its probably not a book. Novel maybe. Iunno

      Iunno. Bad day to begin. My parents gagged me a dragged(ha..rhymes) me to the hair cut place. Bad. Evil place for Zach. The lady was nice. She did what I asked and I had no complaints(i cant spell tonite). Came home. Rode my bike. Talked to my best friend, Brian. And ask a certain girl to go out with me. She agreed. Now I'm here. Lucky fools.

      Well, Friday I sounded completely gay(not ghetto term) and asked Rachel if she wanted to come shopping with my mom, sister, and me today. I guess after pursuading her mom, she was able to go. When we picked her up, things were somewhat awkward. I tried to make small-talk because she was being quiet. I sounded like a   complete   idiot, but I tried for conversation. When we got to the mall, my mom and my sister went through a store and Rachel and I went to wander around the mall. It isn't a big mall, so we lapped it in about 20 minutes. (we had two hours) About half way the second time around, I asked Rachel to do something that I had planned on asking her for quite some time. She didnt want to for specific reasons. It hurt, but I understood. Things were awkward afterwards. I kept beating myself over it. We would be walking and I noticed that we were really close; so I backed off so that I didnt offend her. I enjoyed it, but again, I didnt want to scare her off anymore. The rest of the time was "eggshelly" (as she put) for the both of us. But all-in-all, I had a great time.
