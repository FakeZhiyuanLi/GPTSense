WOW.. that was one fun day. Anyway, last night amanda got mad @ me *tear*. Well.. this morning (saturday)my mom, my brother, and me went to my sister's  car  wash, then took gracie to the vet(if you dont know who gracie is, she's the dog we found and we're keeping her). then we went to the pet store and got her a water bowl and a chew rope thing.

      Howdy! Today Leigha came over to see the puppy! We watched TV and stuff. Then we took the dog to Leigha's and Wilson saw the dog, and then we went to Subway. Then she went to Sarah's and I went to Amanda's. We watched TV then it started to rain. Umm.. then we played in the rain, then ate dinner. After that, we just hung out over there! Now I'm @ home being bored!! Lata!  Sorry for typing perfectly, I am SUCH a loser.

      Howdy.. OMG yesterday me amanda and caleb found a brown an black mix puppy!!! we put up flyers today, but if no one claims it i think we're keeping it! It's staying @ my house right now.. cause amanda's mom wouldn't let it stay @ her house (she has to pay money for pets to live in her house). well.. umm.. yeah, we were riding to burgerhouse and we saw it and it didn't have a collar.. so we took it to burgerhouse and we fed it some of our food. then we went to eckerds to get dog stuff!! hah.. we are BIG losers. anyway.. then it came back to my house and amanda spent the night and we had a big slumber party, lol. ummm.. and today we woke up @ like 6.. *sighs* and then we went to amanda's, then burgerhouse, then we went to sta trying to meet a guy named Thomas, but he didnt come.. oh well. now amanda is over here and we r umm... sitting? well.. she might spend the night again (not sure)....

      Hey there! Well.. umm.. I had a pretty boring day. I went to Stonewall this morning to sign him up, then we went to Long to get my schedule. Gah I am SO going to get lost in there! Anyway, then we went home.. then me and my sister waited @ the Woodrow clinic thingy for 3 hours to get our physical, man that sucked. Then I came back home and I am being bored. I can't get online cause I'm grounded, but I can be on the internet. Anyway.. Hopefully I will be ungrounded by Tuesday. YAY! I am going back-to-school shopping on sunday! That's going to be SO fun! Well.. I miss seing everyone (even though I saw Amanda today @ Long). I wish I could go over there and hang out.. and get online, BUT I can't. Whoa.. this really sucks. So if you want to "IM" me then we have to E-mail back and forth. Hah.. for these days I have to use E-mail (emiline6692@yahoo.com) to "IM". Well.. I gotta go. I am SUPER bored.. and I don't know what else to say. I will be writing later! adios!
