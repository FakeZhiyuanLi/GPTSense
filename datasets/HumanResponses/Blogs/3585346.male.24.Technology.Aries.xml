      Accounting can be quite a tedious job! I have just created a MS access database for my company's accounting. Phew! But I guess it is a must to maintain it so that I can monitor how it is going.  I just configured my router up and running. And I just revived a old compaq notebook and install wireless on it. My router is wireless! WOOHOO it works like magic now but I do have problem earlier :)  Everything went well I got a well deserved sleep plus I dun have to wear Shirt anymore tomorrow so I will not be ironing any more shirt!!!! CHEERS!!!!!! But I have limited polo-ts I guess it is time for some serious shopping! I need another 3 more decent polo t for my SIZE. Yes I emphasize on it cos it is pretty tough to get my size.  Name card, Company stamp....cannot forget!!

      First day of work on Saturday isn't as easy as I think it would be. In fact so many screwed up till I cannot have my first meal of the day until 4pm. Even though it is tough I will persist no matter how difficult it gets.....  Life isn't a bed of roses all the time....and i bought a few inspiration back home from popular book store. Three pieces... It goes like  "Talent and effort are nothing without focus and determination"

Been into some calculation and planning phase about financial controlling and rolling plus some further development.   My mind is pretty bloated but at least get things done with what I wanted. My last day will be on this coming friday. I will be starting my new job on Saturday I HOPE! And still require some discussion later at my friend's company.  Life is all good but again I am left with two days to stuck with shirt as I will be going on polo T real soon! Yeeee Haaaa! I also realise class 95 love to play Hey ya!   Ahh and not forgetting damn Ben for saying the wrong things to the wrong person! YES i find her cute and very cute but you don't have to tell her mum that I should call her Mum-in-law right? I was totally embarrassed! And YEAH! She is cute, quiet, smart and a woman with her own sets of mindset and opinion! I am there so frequently at bukit timah shopping centre is because just to catch a glimpse of her! She is damn damn cute. HAHAHA especially when she is reading the papers regarding soccer. YES! She is the first female soccer fan I ever come across! Special isn't it? Hope can get a few more glimpse before she found a job. Damn but seems that there isn't any topic to chat about....How to start man and lady?   I want a steamer! I want a steamer! I want a steamer! I want a steamer!  And this will bring me to my sweet dreams!

      YES I RESIGNING!  After a no update on Sunday, I got a big surprise! I resigning from my new and current company and will officially leave on this coming friday. Not because of any unhappy stuff in fact they got one of the most wonderful bosses i ever come across in my life time. Really nice people I mean it.   But because of better opportunities out there, I have to think for my own future as well. Yes my company is going relive with a couple of factors coming in together. It is a matter of factors that come together at the correct timing resulted in me leaving my current company. If I miss this opportunity, I might have to wait for some more time and I will grab it tightly else I will regret over it again. I missed a couple and I do not want to miss it again.  This is kind of stress for me as I can no longer be so extravagant on my spending because everything do matters now. Also a time to build my discipline and control. Let's wish me all the best to my future endeavour!   It's not about how many times you fell, it's about how you able to climb back everytime you fell. ---  The Unknown

      I have less than one hour sleep and I reach the groom's place early at 6.20am. All busy tying ribbons to the so call brothers' car. Standard procedure and we set off to the bride's place. Steven and Evelyn is the couple. We reach the bride's place with horning and exhaust sound that awaken almost the entire neighbourhood. Brothers gathered and up we go. Money was not really an issue when asking for keys to enter the bride's place but the second round all the brothers had to do push up and YES I have to do as well oh DAMN IT hahaha! It has been at least 3 or 4 years since i last do a push up during basketball training.   All of us had to go down and do ten oh boy with my weight it is really very tedious for me but finally still able to do it and worst of all, it has been make into the wedding video clip but it was fun. Due to my size, the final stage have to bang the way into the bride's room. The groom had to say something that really touch the bride's heart and It goes like I promise you I will love you, cannot bully you, must care for you, understand you. When you are sad, I will make you happy. When you are down, I will be there always to share with you. When you get bully, I will help you. When you not feeling well, I will take care of you. And end with I love you!   So proceed to groom's place to let the groom's parent to see the newly wed wife and off to their house of the newly wed couple for tea serving ceremony. Follow shortly by church wedding which was even more touching. BUT really a lot of things to read and got to raise and sit again and again. Then was the eating session at the newly wedded couple place and I went to my buddy's house at punggol for a bath and KNOCKOUT for almost four hours. My v12 6.5 litre engine turn out to be a a V8 engine while sleeping (noise of engine reflect on my snore!)  It was the wedding dinner and I become the MC again for Steven and Evelyn. It was fantastic wedding dinner as well because we have fun time teasing the couple but playing games.   After so much, I can't help but to feel fortunate for the both of them. Today is the day, both of them no longer is two different person but as one. They have to consult each other when come to the possibility of affecting each other directly because they are one. Evelyn has a superb night gown which is sexy! But poor drinker Steven have a really tough time! Afterall it is over! A newly wedded couple. Can't help feeling happy for them as I see how both initially say impossible for each other turns out to be together. I have to say love can really change a person. For Evelyn case, she become so much more understanding and caring person, no longer the extravagant her. And of course Steven converted into a Christian just for the Love which I think is really not an easy task.   All the best to this couple! And now I got to get some rest before my lessons going to start early in the morning!

      I do not realise it but my funksoulsista told me I've changed. I am no longer me myself the old me. I no longer smile as freely as happy as last time. Maybe my change of job? Or perhaps other things, since i do not realise it myself how would I know? If I say probably because of busy work schedule and work responsibilities then somehow or rather I am not being true. To find my true self? How long can one self stay? People do change from time to time. I do as well.   Today, Les told me how come I no longer smile as often as before or as happy as before? I am physically tired of course hard to smile. Or again is there any other things else that keep within me? Seriously I have no clue about it, else I would have do something to it before it is too late to do anything.   After thinking for a while, the reason I can't smile because I got too much worries? Worries really make one person unable to smile I think. Just like now I worry about waking up at 5.15 am when now is coming to 3 am OMG and I have not iron my clothes yet. I gonna be in best form later!  Mean while Amelia how's thing going for you? ;) Hope it is not too bad. You know what I am trying to say don't you Amelia? It's definitely feel better just to see it. Most definitely, cos I come across before, as long as that person is happy you should feel great and relieved. But when is not around....time to time you went down and down...till you grown tired of it and before you realise you are kind of out of it. But what I worry is hard to grown tired of it when the positive memories is there. Regarding this can I borrow a laboratory to do some research on it and give you a detail report some how later.

      Was on my way home from my auntie's office. It's a real headache especially a user who enjoy messing up configuration.  But anyway the moment i turn out of Bayshore park to ECP changi airport saw 3 cars was driving quite "interestingly". After the potted plants all went like 140kph so I follow them and I decided to go all the way till 170 and to my susprise i saw one Mazda 323 coming up very fast and tailing behind me. I simply can't shake it off even taking fast bend. It is simply too easy for him to catch even at 170kmph, do not know what the hell is implanted inside.  After exiting at Loyang fly over I gave him a thumbs up. Pretty friendly racing.  FUN after boring work at my auntie's office.....But have no idea why I feel like finding someone to chat with but no one to. The kind of loneliness creeping in again.

      Arrgghhh i got 350 over dollars of bills to clear....and I am pretty broke i mean DAMN BROKE after clearing it up......I need my car allowance urgently! Today is a great day, work was damn bloody smooth and that explain why I am home so early!  I realise I got a very nice boss. Very understanding as well, how I hope all the boss in the world is like him. Humble, Smart, Hardworking and Alert when he look blur blur. I got a lot to learn from him. Now I am really looking forward to take up some big projects but afraid I cannot handle it. Again if I do not try, I will never experience it so if screw,,,screw up lo.   It has been quite sometime since i went holiday overseas.....think I gonna plan one. Ok Let see my wish list according to chronological order...  Mitsubishi EVO 7 and above. Steamer for clothes. Webcam. Digital Camera.   And I hate irritating user plus ignorant user who screw their own configuration up when we have done it nicely. FUCK THEM! WAHAHAHAHA

      Sometimes I feel like just going up to girl i like and just say "Hey! Let's get married and done with!" Just save so much trouble but lacking the sweet and nice experience also the bad experience. But again getting married also can divorce and what's the point then?  When can I find the other partner of mine? This is what i been thinking and could the next gf of mine be my wife and stop it so at least I can concentrate on my family and something worth while with to continue. It is no longer those having fun thingy of just to be together and enjoy romantic moments....it is about life time commitment...AND I am not in a hurry as well.  I was thinking to buy a web camera for my blog so people can see what I have done in my room. And I want to buy a steaming machine to steam my shirts instead if ironing it when the blardy small ironing board cannot fit my shirt properly. Ok I am fat and tall....that explains why normal stuff to me is not normal.  I come to realise what a friend of mine had say....It is not about small unhappy things that you can put off which succeed you but it is more about putting off those super unhappy stuffs which can affect you so emotionally that make you becoming a better and more successful person.  ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Dose Off.........

      I was wondering did I choose my job in IT line correctly? How can I make a difference as in to stand out compare to the rest. I have not been putting in enough effort in my studies....and I keep finding excuse of working to cover it up. I SUCKS! Being professional have to start even while in studies. How professional are you in handling your studies while working. It is time for a wake up call.  I want to be extremely fantastic in what I am doing not just good.

      I am late for work today again. Should get some early rest. This bad habit of mine is getting from bad to worst and the lateness is even carried on till my lesson. Where I step in halfway of the lesson as in really break time then step in. My trying to be funny class mate tell me that lesson already ended which i find it hard to believe. And of course not so stupid to believe. It kinda getting on my nerves, working had really put me off from my studies and I think i am lacking back. By hook or by crook I gotta get my proposal done this week.   Life has been so good so far, I have just burn two track into my mp3 collection CD in my car. One is from Amelia's website that Hikaru Utada Track is so nice and solid, not forgetting I am a fan of her. Another is what you are hearing now, "Just the way you are" by Diana Krall.   But suddenly feel so alone while hearing that Hikki's song, very terribly lonely feeling. Listen while driving my car to lessons. have not been touching my car for almost three days. After driving my comany vehicle I learn how to appreciate my car more than ever before.   Okay lecturer is in for lessons, my idiotic classmate trying to be idiotic telling me idiotic lies has not succeed.

      Guess what I manage to call in and express my point of view or should i say my experience? It is fantastic! But voice sound so yucky! Damn it!!!!Anyway it is my first time calling up after 24 years in this planet?  Jen was complaining that I did not dedicate song to her and Adrian after hearing me on live. I called my buddy to tune in as well. The topic is about apologising and the realisation of the need to apologise came so late that it is no longer an issue but at least I learn something out of it. Very excited about it! Damn Damn Damn I still can taste the freshness of excitement Man Man Man...just like the sentence find in the Movie Titanic.  Anyway I had a fun day, entire day I mean. Busy ogling at fantastically beautiful woman while working. Day went smoooootthhh....but my cigz went ooooohhhhhh cos menthol lights sucks! yucks! fucks! Beside a smooth day at work the only unsmooth thingy is my company van....it is screetching like crazy inside out and I have no idea what happen.  This saturday is coming! And I am looking forward to it! But guess I have no partner to bring to after my buddy is attached. LOOK is ALL your fault buddy! Hahaha...but no is me who do not allow you to go :D  Principles is principles ya? There is a thin line drawn between principles and MCPists which most of the time people get it wrongly not for my case at least but other day to day life and relationship.  Ny noodle is good for myself! Is yummy! I had a problem cooking it nicely on Saturday while over at Adrian's house. Western Food is up next week! Black Pepper BBQ Steak sound great huh? I gonna get some of it while brushing up my culinary skill.

      It is 5am coming to 6am. I just finished bathing. Shiok and TREND MICRO ROXS! Suddenly I do not feel like sleeping anymore. Can someone hit me unconsious?  Worth it or not? I always ask. Different people weigh things differently and worth is of different value to each and everyone. While realising how bad decision people made to you is just a bad decision but to others is a worth while decision made. I believe in my decision, if my decision does not work out then it is not a good decision made. Probably make you seems like you have no foresight which is pretty important in carreer or business aspect. And also part of job nature in decision making, one wrong decision made decide how tough things gonna get. At least this is what i feel in my job, every wrong step made will make you lose your job. Sometimes there isn't a wrong decision or right decision because simply the after effect of the decision is not that strong.  I think I just forgotten to iron my clothes again and I gonna give shit about it now and get some sleep I am left with 5 hrs to sleep. Good Morning! And Sweet Awake!

At least there is some improvement compare to the past three days that we do not know what happen at all. We basically was working hard for nothing. Today we found the cause and thanks to useless norton and mcafee the entire company is down but also thanks to them I can keep my rice bowl alive!  I am tired seriously lack of sleep. I want to sleep!  Work.............. Stupid Viruses............. Stupid Micr0soft.................

Afternoon will be a well dugged graveyard for me to fall in as one company's entire network having problem due to unknown virus attack. Guess tonight will be another night of OT. Let's get myself prepared....a lawyer firm and american club to go for my field detail but I feel like eating more snake at home and just went I am typing my hp ringing for me to reach american club by 2pm.  I want to watch HARRY POTTER and the prisoner of Azkabanz!!! I have no time for it at the moment two proposals coming up....time's up! time to work!

      I cannot imagine I am awake watching this match. But something tell me I cannot withstand it soon and will go to sleep real soon. After all, this is one of the big match everyone expecting in Euro 2004.  I can't sleep also probably because I been sleeping too much yesterday. Start to feel the blues of Monday, weekend are so short for me. Been lamenting always, some people lament just for the sake of lamenting though.   Thinking of the receipe stolen from my mum, braised pork.....lotus stem soup and not lotus root soup...I like soup a lot and I thinking of doing this lotus stem soup some times next week at Adrian's house.  Up and coming is my friend's wedding real soon. Actually I also pretty envy couple that get married. The vows are so nice and sweet but come back to real life is really harsh seeing the increasing divorce rate in Singapore make one wonder if they really got the correct partner in life?  ** Roger ponders to sleep.............

      Woke up! And saw my buddy msg me...while in blur blur mode she was saying about her problem in her r/s. It was kinda expected problem for me and I told her she have to go through all these obstacles or problem to come if she made a decision. Life isn't a bed of roses so problems are there for a reason. But this some how or rather also remind me of a sentences that goes like these...."There is always a solution to a problem is whether we accept the solution as a solution to the problem. People who do not accept those solution to the problem will say that there is no solution." Making a wise decision and applying a solution wisely at the toughest condition is one of the most difficult stuff to do simply because human get too emotional. Human without emotion is useless as well. Usually is because of someone that affect one's acceptance of solution as solution. They put themselves in other shoes and feel it and get emotional about it if they are in their shoes they will not accept this solution as solution and thus affecting their ability to solve problems.  Coming back from preachy stuff.....I been sleeping all the way till 4pm. Just finished my sumptous dinner at my mum's place and at the same time stole some receipe from her on the soup she made. I always look forward on Sunday where I can sleep till crazy and proceed to have yummy dinner at mum's place.  Went for a car wash at geylang! As in why geylang cos they simple wash every spot they possibly could! While waiting i see two pure white rexes washing....admiring it and wondering why they take so long .....but I really do not mind waiting for a good job done on my car. Just when I lighted up my ciggy, a couple of China pros walking pass. I realise what my secondary school friend, Freddy, mentioned about how his camp mate describe the China Pros. They got such a overflowing breast that their normal hand cannot grab hold of. So i was wondering can my big hand do the job! Then there was taxi driver waiting for car wash as well suddenly chatting with me about how clean the car wash and he always come down to the shell station to wash after sending three China Pros down to work. And he say he sianz of China Pros and trying to go for Negro Pros ......while i find him crazy i was called to shift my car for vacuum and drying.  Enjoy my clean ride home and been trying to improve on my bloggy and finding out the coding...and chatting on MSN now...  I forgot to iron my clothes and will keep on improve on this thingy.

      Today I really learn how to appreciate the kinda stroke of luck that is required somehow or rather in IT line. You can spend a few days searching for a solution but ends up with nothing or worse when you end up with no solutions thanks to Micr0s0ft Product. But with this little bit of touch of luck, you can just solved it within minutes. I really appreciate it.  As usual I am late for work, I always do not want to be late. But seems like the more I do not want to be late the more later i reach my office. Thanks to understanding Boss, which i seem to taken for granted, everything went normal.  Went to Adrian and Jen House to become Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Chef. I need a lower quality pot instead of this thick base pot for tracing the readiness of the noodle. It was a rush day and in fact I did not go for my SAT lessons. I kind of worried as my idiot (pronounce as ee-D-york) lecturer been missing two previous lessons.  By the time I am typing these my head is spinning badly after chatting with my Secondary School friends. Adios I will be back for more!

      I finished work at 11pm. Thank god! Went down to meet Gilbert at Kallang Mac for SHC outing. Most of them has went back but the night has yet to start!  As usual meeting forum guys, tonight with a few of our own guys joining for our usual Friday rounding session in OG. Fun night with my buddy and her bf, not forgetting the sound of Ferrari Modena 360 ringing in ears since last Friday night!  Sound and Look of evos and rexes are making me more high than just having sex! Just like sex best part is still about owning it and feel it while you RIDING it! Woohoo! TPs and Police are all over by the fourth round. Detour when see blinking lights! Thanks to Vern and Bud for alerting me as well. Went to Mohd Sultan, damn bloody commotion had to invite riot police to come down at MS. It's like two buses of riot policeman what the fuck? Some how or rather I have a feeling I may get into accident again if I continue this kinda routine. Mean while just be more careful and most IMPORTANT OF ALL no fast adrenaline pumping music. No Initial D. No Techno. No Trance. No Retro as well to play safe. Surveys show that more than 60% of accident resulted by fast adrenaline kicking music. And I got mine on last year APRIL FOOL DAY!  Tomorrow....I mean later is a casual dressing day to work and I dunno where the shit my Polo Ts gone to....Is not inside my big, huge and overflowing laundry bag...not inside the god damn wardrobe.....I am not gonna wear shirt for Saturdays....Is so sick....  I need lotsa lotsa lotsa money....my lessons...my car...my hobby...I wish I got part time stuff to do .....i got work! and I got work and i got work....i goooott work...laterZ

      To think that I am able to have fun on friday night, it is pretty much spoilt by Overtime! I am late for appointment and I have no one to blame but myself for this Overtime. KILL ME!   I went to a Korean Household and a Japanese Household today and guess what? Their daughters roxs! I always wanted a Japanese wife and I do not mind a Korean wife as well, they are so sweet, cute, pretty, sunshine and loving young lady.   I will be chanting for a Japanese wife while i doing OT to motivate myself! **Roger drools to work.

      I was trying to post something yesterday night and i got so pissed by this blog as it hang plus I still have no time to do my page up. It look like a piece of messy shit to me. Got a tough time figuring out the coding as it been years since I meddle with HTML OR SHTML OR XML OR whatever you want to call it.  Purpose of this BLOG first I goona get my project done up but I am not motivated therefore I create this messy stuff I have here to get myself motivated.  Tired day of work! Plus brooding over money and brooding over how sucky my school guide book can get! It is farking piece of useless a4 size double sided printed or photo-stated cut and paste nonsense. I pay so much for it and they gonna give me nonsensical guide book.  I rather they give me thick reference book and pick example to explain then I have nothing much to refer to when I need!  Just finished ironing my clothes as usual, have a makan session at SIMPANG bedok(WHICH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT!) with my buddy. A nice, petite, crazy and silly female buddy. Cheese BOOM is unusually OILY but is nice after tasting the cheese inside. And before I get hungry again I better end this post and get some badly needed rest.  My buddy gonna get to see this messy shit today. Bud Please bear with me! Hang in there while i do it up nicer

I have some fucker come to tell me " You so daring leh give up your job just to come out on your own, when he is the one in the first place asked me to come out" Anyway it is my decision and I will be responsible for my own decision. But I hate hypocrite.   Coming back to myself.....I finished smoking my last stick of ciggy at 3.30pm. And till now I have not smoke, I get tired of it and due to health reason I think it is better to try quitting now. It is tough especially without anyone by myside. But i will try.  For those single out there...Have you ever thought of having someone you like or you love by your side or in your arms quietly enjoying the peaceful quiet moment by the sea side or any place nice. It has been years since I last enjoy that. Sometime when you are extremely down, all you need is that someone to be by yourside and you feel better even without she/he saying anything or do anything. I dunno for ladies but sometimes guys do need that.   Frankly speaking I am hanging in there still.....Thing is not as easy as I initially planned....all lot of unexpected things happened. At the moment, I am pretty lost and confused. Think I shall go for a jog at the gym tomorrow.

      Things slowly fall back into normal mode again. Even work wise also slowly picking up again. There is always up and down I guess, whenever down I feel so unease. I just hope for more good times. Time to seat down and think of more ways to earn more money. As I need them more and fast! Wahaha! Ain't I greedy. Hmmm at least I know now I am earning a bit more than what I used to have which is good. To earn way more what i have is to work hard and smart.   First pot of gold...first pot of gold where are you? Today I met a couple of cute woman at work....damn the people from China is getting more and more pretty for the ladies! Woohoo! Wonder how is my buddy? She is flying to HK for her training flight. Must be fun I guess. And Looking forward for weekend. Should I rest on Saturday for mahjong session? I think I should...Shouldn't I?&nbsp;  Hey Fellows Check this URL out very nice scenery of JAPAN! I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO JAPAN AND FIND A JAPANESE WIFE! Oooooooohhhhh How nice. Turn off the lights and Enjoy the URL!   urlLink http://ww4.tiki.ne.jp/~mmurakami/setoy/map.html   &nbsp;

      It is great today and I realise I enjoy talking to her a lot even only on msn. It has been long since I last typing and smiling onto the monitor. Can't help but to think of the good times in the past. I even try to be cool by asking how is her wedding preparation, but it kind of hurts badly inside me&nbsp;without her knowing. But nonetheless it is still fun chatting with her after so long.

      Ladies and&nbsp;gentle man.  Today you about to see the down time of Roger. &nbsp; Things is in totally screwed stages, and I am busy fixing over the weekend and even today when I am breathing in the air in my room which also means I am doing nothing thanks to LPWBB (You gonna reverse it) for screwing up everything and for not following the procedures and trying to be smart alec and FARK HIM for being the big screwed up. &nbsp; I never seen such irresponsible, sacarstic, fake, dumb and arrogant idiot before. And now I met one. But I am not heated because of him. I am heated because promise was not meant to be kept.  &nbsp; Ok enough of complaining, I love and hate to complain. Anyway I screwed my studies big time i guess. I gonna stop for four months and I hope it is worth while for a short pause. I think meanwhilw i got clear up all the left over mess created by LPWBB before I continue doing other things.

      Yeah! Being jobless again today, I went Ikea shopping for the TV console cum cupboard cum PC repair area. I have like calculated to have 20 over electrical plugs in my small puny room. I can get electrocuted anytime hahaha!   Anyway this Gorm know by IKEA is solid good for my tv my spare monitors for PC trouble-shooting or virus removal. Planning to convert my room into a small small office damn it. LoL but I like the idea! Wire running neat.  Got three posters at popular three weeks back but only now then I got the time to paste up it goes like:  Focus: Talent and effort are nothing without focus and determination. Success: Some people dream of success...when others wake up and work hard at it. No one can predict to what heights you can soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. Quite nice isn't it?  And I got a long 24 k gold plated cable to run across my carpet and my two pair of Altec Lansing ACS 48.1 to run into 4 speaker mode but with two sub woofer! It is really the surround kind of feeling! YEA YEA YEA!!!  Another thingy is I realise I am lousy at steaming machine to iron my clothes as well cos I have a tough time mastering it at my buddy house.  Wish list for tomorrow is two additional lightings for my new TV console! That makes my room with 8 lightings altogether. My room is neat but packed with stuff! I must find a place to store my car exhaust...suspension...extractor...rear lights for ES and EK really taking up a bit of space man. And i think i should get rid one of my old golf set....basically my room is now packed with three cupboards, one wardrobe, one small plastic cupboard, one small wooden cupboard, one wooden display corner display console, one computer table and one queen size bed. Which is like making the walking space become very very very small.  Gonna get a web cam to take it down but of course when i do more packing!

      Come to think of it suddenly while i packing my room, everything is still so fresh after so many years. The wonderful time to me...i wonder if it has been fun for her. Those fun memories...the fun...the sad...the happy...the romantic....It has been torturing sometimes to think about as it is so sweet that you can smile to yourself and still feel happy about it and on the other hand you feel the sudden emotion of sadness overcome you the next moment.   It's more than five years already. The feeling is so strong those time. But although I have already move on....from time to time i cannot help myself by not remembering it or recalling once a blue moon. I am a human afterall.  Meanwhile I feel like out of job.....damn it....I feel so unease at home doing nothing but packing my room sorting out some admin stuff for my company....but i earn shit.....No one say it is easy to start off your own....  And this is just the start of the uneasiness...i guess there is more to come. We shall see to it.

      Been working very hard....very very hard and so darn busy that I neglected a lot of stuff. Is this the kind of sacrifice i got to give ? I always been asking myself. I put in a lot...but do not know where it will bring me to. It's scary and frightening and even stressed when there is nothing to do.   I want to talk to someone always but time is always not enough for me nowadays. I have nice weekends playing mahjong for the past three weeks.   Working can be very sad when everything do not work out. But when it is your own business, no matter what it has to work out. Perhaps that is it keep me going! I want my own first pot of gold!!!! Worth it or not is still too early to say but decision must be well made.  Let get this over and done with so I can go another step higher than ever before. 5 more months! The faster you climb the harder you fall...I used to hear this from someone. But I hope 5 months is not to fast huh? Fast or slow depend on individual's context.   Anyway the most important thing is. I got nothing to lose.

      Talking about that...It has been so long since I last catch up with my sec school mates. A couple of them Freddy, Jezamine and Chi Chuan. Freddy and Jezamine has been couple since secondary 2 really is one of the couple that most of us envied most and not to mention it does not come easy.  Walking with them along Wisma and Taka kind of remind me of our secondary school days, when we got nothing to do but to walk and talk cock. Our joker, Chi Chuan, was all time funny since secondary school. With him around there will always be non stop laughter.  Just finish watching a TV show, it goes like this "If you have a Dream, walk towards it."  "Si vous avez un rêve, marchez vers lui."

      FUCK the damn bus driver who murdered the black little kitten. I mean it FUCK him big time. What is the fucking damn hurry in the damn carpark, can't he let the kitten and the cats cross the damn road before he drive over them.  FUCK him!  *Below is not advisable for the weak hearted*  Ok enough of swearing, it's useless anyway. I was like preparing to go to fetch my mum from work. While I warming up the car, i saw this small cute kitten trying to cross the road as the kitten parent is almost over the other side.  I still wanted to go down to play with the kitten while warming my car up because it is so damn cute. And GUESS WHAT? The next moment....WHAM! And the poor innocent black kitten was run over and trampled by the school bus driven by a bastard. At that moment, the adult cat was trying to save it but too late....Next moment i saw this kitten wriggling and using the muscle reflaxes to hop around and blood was splurting all over the area around the kitten. It is in god damn pain and after 20 secs of struggling and twitching. Everything is over for the small kitten. (While I am typing this I still can remember the truma event clearly..I feel a bit agitated about the bus driver) The brain juice ooze out from the left eye of the kitten as the eye is no where to be seen but flesh and brain juice. The blood that splurting around while it struggling is all over (around 60cm diameter) with mince pieces of flesh or brain all over with the blood. It is a mess! A total disgusting horror scene. The adult cat moaning by the side of the lifeless carcass. Two of them staring at the dead kitten and whining. The kind of helplessness ..... I was at a moment of lost. By this time some neighbour saw the left over mess and feel disgusted. I carefully drive by the side of the carcass to examine the horror scene to proof what i though is true. It is lifeless....No heartbeat but blood still flowing all over through out from the eyes and body. I drive over ask the security to get the cleaner to clean up the mess as I do not want the carcass to be in more worse condition.  There is no hurry in the damn car park there is no damn car behind the bus. WHY the damn FUCK the bus driver got to run over it when it is so obvious there is two adult cats and one kitten trying to cross the damn bloody small drive way of the car park.  Can you imagine it again. You were on the way down from your car seat to pick up the kitten and the damn blardy bus just wham over it. I should have reacted faster...i could have save the kitten.......but I also never realise the bus coming....Imaging the twitch is so powerful that it is able to twitch and hop in the air using the stomach muscle. The kind of immense pain is horrible. So guy driving out there, becareful you will not want to run over human in this manner. I mean if it is on the expressway or roads out there kitten or cats or dogs is a no choice but to wham it and kill it but WHAT THE FUCK? It is in the carpark drive way where speed limit is 25kmph.  Ok When i reach home, I still see the patch of blood stain left over. Is just in front of the porch at my block. The kitten is barely two months old. Ok enough i feel so tensed up while typing this..  Anyway I have to draw out some time chart and plans to get a new project going on. Two jobs in the evening tomorrow and party time! It is my buddy's house warming! Just loaded 7 cartons of drinks from my family coffee shop to his house yesterday.   May the spirit of the kitten rest in peace. I will pray for you.

      I am really too free. I need to sit down and think. It has been sometime...I start to ask myself this question again. What am I doing? Trying to learn something for nothing or learn something to do something when I have yet to settle with what I really want to do.  It may sound stupid but I remember i got this customer that tell me you never know what you will end up doing and bring your success nearer to you. Just hang in there and think of something. Hanging in there doing nothing will not help any further.  I mean at least I did do something today but it does not seems enough to me at all.  Lost is the word? I am asking.

      I never know it has been half a year already since feb. Times really flies...I am thinking of what i have done so far for the first half of the year and what I am gonna do for my already started second half. Pretty late huh? But who cares? As long as I feel good!  As usual weekend spent at Adrian and Jen place, watching movie garfield and eating then working on Sat. Then eating at Lao Pat Sat, the fatman satay is still as fantastic but damn the chicken wings really sucks big time. It isn't the same taste as I use to eat before although it is from the same stall.  That night, I had a good catch up session with my buddy. Yes Lisa...she gonna be a official air stewardess soon after her SY trip or something like that. It has been so long since I got a nice chat with her. Even though nothing much as it was pretty late as well and afraid of her BF complained about her or me.  Working? Work life isn't that good. Been pretty quiet and I still got a few more accounting entries not key in as I am too lazy plus looking at the ORANGE sky outside right now make me even more lazy. It is about to have a serious and heavy down pour. Sorry Correction as I just open the window and realised it is already down pouring. Cool! I like this kind of weather. Cool and easy for tomorrow.  It's time for me to think of something to do.  Hey btw I got a couple of photos to upload as I take it off from my class room today.... Ever see a Cisco Catalyst 2950 XLi eating "Po Chai Pills" hahahaha! I mean i got nothing better to do so i try feeding the Catalyst Switch with Po Chai Pills. I ddin really feed it of course I would have make it go down with water and burst the switch. Anyway we have a power failure while doing lessons half way with the routers.......frame relay configuration isn't as difficult as it seems after all...  Projects and Projects In terms of work I want more!! :)
