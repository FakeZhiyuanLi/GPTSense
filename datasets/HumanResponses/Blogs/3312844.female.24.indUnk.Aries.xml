      From: Aaron To: brookenyc@hotmail.com Date: May 30, 2004  I feel like I am never going to talk to you again.  I wanted to talk to you because I am kinda pissed at my friends and I wanted to talk to you about it.  You arent here though so what am I to do?  Aaron

      From: Aaron To: brookenyc@hotmail.com Time: 9:13 p.m.  Ok well now I cant even make this sound nicer than it really is, this sucks!  It really does because I was having a great time talking to you and you just leave me hanging now.  I know you have left to go home so my chances of hearing from you until next week are not good.  But damn, I want a letter from you and its really frustrating me.  I only say this because I really want to hear from you, but are you really so busy that you cant spend five mins writing me an email, do you care or want me to continue writing you, I dont get it.  If you want me to stop, I will, absolutely I will.  I dont want to be chasing someone that I am only annoying.  I thought we were actually getting along really well, and now I dont know what happened.  Its so hard for me to think about not writing you, or not having enough time to write you a couple mins, but you seem to be so busy that you cant, what do you do with yourself, I dont get it?     Just tell me, be honest and we'll go from there, if that means I have to cut this off then fine, but just tell me and I will stop bugging you. Aaron

      From: Aaron  Sent : 	Wednesday, May 26, 2004 10:44 PM To : 	Brooke Johnson   Subject : 	Re: hello, again.  Well, I dont really know what to say, I keep expecting an email from you and I continue to be left without one, I dont really get it, how can I be disappointed, I havent even met you.  But really I just dont get it, it seemed like we were talking daily, if it was just to drop me a line and say hi, seems like that only takes a minute, but now you dont do it, I dont really get it but I know you are busy so I will try to take comfort in that, its hard though.  I would like a response to my other email, the one that I sent the day before yesterday, its kinda bugging me, so whenever you get a chance, which I guess might not be until next week with you going home and all, but whenever you get a chance. see ya  Aaron

      ..."There are so many lanes, and once you leave one, that doesn't mean it disappears, it just goes on without you. And you without it. When you left the scenic drive for the interstate it wasn't necessarily because you liked the big road better. Sometimes to get where you were going you needed to get on the highway. People did what they had to do. ... You might not enjoy traffic lights and congestion, but if you liked the city enough you might be willing to bear those things. You took the roads you thought you had to take. Sometimes you got lost. You took wrong turns. You stopped by the side of the road to pick raspberries. You hit a deer and totaled the car. You kept driving. And all the while, you could still only ever be in one place at one time, which didn't necessarily mean it was the place you most wanted to be, it just meant that was where you were." - The Good People of New York

      So I was cleaning up my laptop, because my boyfriend is coming into town for a visit and I'm covering my bases. Anyway, I came across a txt file I wrote a little over a year ago. It was weird to read and reminded me how much has happened since then. It goes a little something like this:  May 14, 2004 Location: 113th and Broadway  I'm not exactly sure when it happened. Maybe it was the first day I met him, because he said something that made me smile. But somewhere between August and November, he didn't have to say anything, just seeing him made me smile and made my stomach turn somersaults. I liked how he didn't have to try hard to do well, and how he was OK with watching HBO while everyone else was stressing out over deadlines and story drills. I liked how he had a West Wing night and always asked me questions about AP style over instant messenger. I liked how he took runs in Riverside Park and left a note on his away message that informed you of his whereabouts. I liked the clever anecdotes he would leave for others to read, like it was meant just for me.  I liked how he would message me when something exciting happened to him or when he found an interesting article online that he wanted me to read. It made me feel important - needed. I like how he trusted me enough to ask me to read his stories while they were still in the works. I liked how he would talk about his hometown in Michigan, and how he saw his mom every six weeks.  And then the spring came and our schedules changed.. I talked to him more than ever (on IM), but saw him less and less at school. And that made seeing him in the halls that much more special. During the past two weeks, this longing for him intensified. Being apart from Anthony made me feel free to give my feelings to someone new. We exchanged mp3s over AOL. The more I saw and thought about him, the more I liked him.   Then, three weeks before graduation, out of nowhere, we kiss during a drunken night at a wonderfully trashy bar. And now I worry that he'll soon forget about me and our kiss, writing it off as something that only happens to two people on one of those nights when they drink to much to think straight. We've talked since then, and he's "glad we're friends." I'm disappointed because that's all we are.  Now our talks seem like small talk. And I feel like I'm losing my grip, if I ever had it to begin with. I fantisize that everything will change when he sees me again for the first time. And I spend more time at school hoping I run into him than I ever did working on any story.  I know he'll stay with her. But I want him to be with me. Am I wrong to want that? Probably, but a girl can dream, can't she?

      So the night before last I had a "Law & Order" moment. You know at the beginning of the show when a person (or a couple of people) is going about his normal business and suddenly a dead body appears seemingly out of nowhere? Yea, that happened to me.  Freaky, right? Yea, it was. But since I was sick and wearing my glasses that I can't really see too well out of, it was even more freaky.  So I don't know if this guy was actually dead. He could've been a bum, passed out on the sidewalk for a nice little nap. But he sure looked dead, and he didn't look like he was homeless. He was a middle-aged man, with jeans and a button-down shirt and a nice wrist watch.   I struggled with what to do. The police precinct is right around the corner. I could walk over there or call 9-1-1. But then a group of people walked up, like they'd been struggling with the same decision for awhile. There were about four of them. And people were starting to gather and come out of their apartments to see what was going on. So I decided to let them handle it. These things are probably best left to people who aren't visually impaired.  I was feeling like shit anyway. The whole thing was pretty disturbing, especially since it happened mere steps from my apartment. But now I really want to know what happened to the poor guy.   I thought it was really cool when Jerry Orbach and company set up shop outside my apartment near Columbia to shoot an episode of "Law & Order" last year. But I'd much rather watch that shit on TV than see it on my East Village block. Yikes.

      NO NO NO, I hope you were kidding. I wasnt trying to make you jealous, about the friend part, I was trying to vent my frustrations.  I really want to be friends with her, just friends.   However, everytime we drink she wants to make out and it has killed our relationship. Well, what killed our relationship was her taking me home to her hometown and presenting me to everyone as her boyfriend -- that killed it.  When I first got here, I hung out with her and her godparents and their family everyday, I loved it.  They are a great family, the kids are great and everything I thought was great.  But then she started expressing her feelings for me and trying to make what we had a relationship and I didnt want anything more than a friendship.  Then she asked me to drive one of her godparents cars to penn. while she drove her car so that I could drive her back and she could leave her car there.  I turned out that she didnt need me to take the car in the end, she just wanted to take me home.  It was the worst weekend, I had to attend all these parties and go to all her relatives houses, and all they did was talk about us as a couple and me as her boyfriend.  So anyway that was like two months ago and I have seen her twice since we got back, both times she has tried to make out with me.  So last night I knew that she would get drunk and try to make out with me and then regret it today when she was sober and I was right.  I had to make sure all of her and her friends got home last night and in to bed and make sure that she was ok.  Then today had to listen to her apologize for trying to make out with me.  I wasnt trying to make you jealous, really I wasnt.  As far as telling you about the other girls, I wanted you to know that I was thinking about you, that it didnt matter that other women were around, that I would have rather been with you.  I am really sorry that you were feeling so ill, thats not cool at all.  It was really hot yesterday too and that must have just been miserable, I wish that I could have come over to take care of you.  I thought you were home kind of early the other night, but wasnt sure if you went to that party or not, seemed like you would have been out later if you had.    I hope that you feel better.  As far as this week, dont worry about it, its actually a good week for you to be away and not able to talk to me, my friends from san diego are coming into town on thursday and then leaving friday morning for dc, then I am meeting them in dc on sat and all of us are coming back sun.  Then they are staying with me until wed.  So I dont know how much I am going to be around after thursday anyway.  I hope that it isnt as hot today, yesterday was hell, I am not looking forward to summer heat.  I really need to get that ac.    OK, so now that I have written you a book and you are probably bored out of your mind reading it I will let you go and hope that you are feeling better.  If you have time this week I would love to talk to you, but I understand if you are busy.  I will write again before you go home.    Talk to you soon, dont be jealous, I think about you all the time. Aaron

      Aaron:  So, are you trying to make me jealous? Cause it's working. Friends trying to make out with you, beautiful girls at bars and two girls from San Diego as your new roommates?  Great ...  I wasn't busy all day; I was in bed. Sick as a dog, actually. But I'm glad you've been having fun.  I went to dinner last night, but then I started to feel really sick, so instead of going to Queens for the party (even though I did buy a nice gift at Crate & Barrel), I went home around 9.  I've been there ever since, trying to sleep but wishing it weren't so damn hot and sweating through a fever that made it even hotter. I just ventured out for the first time a little while ago to buy some Gatorade and a bagel.  And to top off my night, I just saw a mouse run across the kitchen floor. Fantastic.  So, needless to say, the rest of my weekend wasn't nearly as fabulous as yours.  Also, my mom called and said she bought me a plane ticket home for Memorial Day weekend. So I won't be around much this week. Need to tie up loose ends before I leave town on Thursday.  Good luck with your second week of work.  Brooke

      Hey, well I guess you were busy today. What did you do, I might have seen you, not sure though, what were you doing around 7-715, what were you wearing? I hope your day went well, I have got to get to bed, gotta get up early.  I actually didnt wake up until like 3, and the only reason I got up then was these girls came by to rent out my roommates room.  They were from san diego too, they seem like cool girls, but the thing that sucks is they both have to leave right around the time I do, that sucks, I am going to have to fight for bathroom time with TWO GIRLS everyday this summer, I am not that excited about that.  But other than that they seem chill.  Anyway, I am sure it will work out somehow.   I hope your day went well, drop me a line when you get a chance. Aaron

      hey, I missed you tonight, I will have to tell you all about it, it was fun for a while, then it just got out of hand and I am sorta dreading tomorrow because I know its going to mean I have to talk to my friend who lives here, basically one of the only friends I have in the city.  She was trying to make out with me all night and basically wanted to have sex with me.  It sucks though, I just want to be friends with her and I turned her down so many times tonight and I know when she is sober today she is going to want to talk about it and apologize.  I just dont want to deal with it, I have been clear with her so many times that I dont want to be anything more than friends, she doesnt seem to get it, its sad and I feel horrible turning her down.   I missed you tonight, and I really did think about you a lot.  I am not going to lie, there were beautiful girls around last night, we went to this bar and had a great time, but the fact is that I was thinking about you, and wanted to be with you and didnt do anything with them, I was a good kid.  But I do miss you a lot and I thought about you tonight, I wish you were on right now, but maybe later. goodnight Aaron

      Aaron:  Hello again! I really miss talking to you, too. But it has been nice to have something to look forward to everyday (an e-mail in my box).  I'm glad you like work. I think the friendliness comes with time. The most important thing you can do right now is learn how to do your job well. I think the other stuff just has to happen naturally.  I'm sure it's a big change to go from unemployment to working a 9-to-5 job. But you still have your weekends! It's weird though, because it's almost like your free time has to become more productive, too, because there's less of it. Does that make any sense?  I must admit, I did think about you when I was in Boston. And when I thought I saw you on the street, I was really nervous. I really want to chat online again soon. Then maybe we can work our way to the phone ... But I haven't given up on the idea of taking it slow. Hope that's still OK. I think it'll be worth the wait.  I'll try to be online between 7-8 p.m., but I'm having dinner with some friends, so I won't be able to stay online much longer than that. Looking forward to talking to you again.  Brooke

      Sent: 3:25 a.m. Location: East Village, NY  Brooke,  Hey. I was beginning to worry that you didn't want to speak to me anymore.  I think it's great that you aren't home because you are out getting stories. That's a wonderful thing, and I don't want to get in the way of that.  I do wear glasses from time to time, but not today, and normally only when I am hanging around the house. I try not to wear them for a full day just because they are a pain.  So it wasn't me, but it could have been on another day.  I do like work, the people seem to be great. Although, I kinda feel bad, because I haven't been that friendly to that many people. I have been trying to concentrate on what I have to learn because Monday I felt totally overwhelmed, and I really didn't want any distractions. But yesterday it all seemed to be coming together, at least somewhat.  That's not to say that I know it all. No way, not even close. And if I did I would be sad because I would be really bored from now on.  I am usually on now after work, which can be anytime from 5:30 to probably around 7, until I go to bed which was around 10 last night.  It's so sad that is all the free time I have to myself!    I would love to spend it with you. You amaze me, and I want more of you!  You make me smile, my stomach twists when I think about you.  Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I am going to ...  I really wanted you here with me this last weekend, while I was laying in bed falling asleep. I wanted you here with me, I wanted to hold you while I fell asleep, but you were in Boston :(  Thats ok though, someday we will meet. And hopefully you will still like me, and down the road maybe I will get that opportunity. It would be amazing to have you here.  Anyway, I am going back to sleep so I don't scare you anymore, I just woke up randomly and checked my mail to see that you had written, which was really wonderful and made me really happy.  Sleep well, good luck with the stories, hopefully we can talk in the early evening sometime. Talk to you soon.  Aaron    -------------- Aaron-  Hey. I'm really sorry we keep missing each other. It sucks. But I get a smile on my face everytime I see a new e-mail from you in my inbox. Actually, I think I saw you tonight. I was on Ave. A and this guy was crossing the street, but he had on glasses. Do you wear glasses? Anyway, it was weird. I wasn't sure what to do so I kept walking.  I'll try to be online earlier in the evening. I've been trying to get out and work on some stories to pitch, so I haven't been home much. Maybe we should set a time when we can both be online ... how does that sound?  I really hope work is going well for you. Do you like it? Talk to you soon (I hope).  Brooke

      I feel like I don't even know myself anymore. I have different faces I show to different people, and I'm not entirely sure which one of them is really me. I have too many secrets, and I'm not even sure who knows them. I don't even like having secrets. It gets too complicated. Part of me wants to erase all the lies I've told and stupid things I've done and just start fresh. And I can feel the day approaching when all of these lies are going to come crashing down on top of me.  So who am I really?  Still trying to figure that one out.

      They say New York is the city that never sleeps, but I didn't know that meant I would never sleep once I moved here.  Yes, while millions of city dwellers are catching some Zs, I'm still up ... surfing the Craigslist personals. Is that because I'm looking for love online? Well, no. Been there, done that. Am I looking to hook up with someone? Possibly. I've been known have an online fling or two.  But who are all these people that post on CL? Are they as bored as I am? Are they just horny and too lazy to get outside? Are they normal people who think this could actually work? These are things I wonder about at 4 a.m.  So my addiction started with apartments. I'd try to find the cheapest apartment in the best neighborhood. But then I discovered the personals. I told myself I'd never submit my own ad; I would only answer ads other people had posted. This method seemed to satisfy my cravings at first. But then after about a week, I'd drifted from "Strictly Platonic" to "Casual Encounters" and viewed every worthy ad (and some of the not-so-worthy ones). I would hit refresh over and over wondering if anyone new had posted an ad. Pathetic, right? So I took a deep breath, and submitted my own ad in "Strictly Platonic." Here's how it went:  "Hey. I just moved back to the city for a great job (went to grad school here). Only problem is I get off work around midnight, and I usually want to do something after work, but everyone's already on their way to bed. Any late-nighters up for weekday drinking downtown? We don't have to drink ... could get a bite to eat or just hang out. Looking to gather a few people (men and women) for a regular late-night group. I'm 24, female, Midwesterner, educated, friendly and fun!  I'm on AOL IM if you want to chat further. Please tell me something about you in the e-mail."  Innocent enough, right? Fifty e-mails later, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but I sort through them anyway. I weed out the folks who can't spell and the guys who just want sex. I weed out the weird e-mail addresses and AOL screen names. I come up with a few folks. I chat 'em up. Some seem nice, but my little drinking group never really materializes.  I try again ...   At this point, my CL surfing has gotten much worse. Instead of heading to "Strictly Platonic" first, now I'm heading straight for "Men Seeking Women" then "Casual Encounters." It gets so bad I actually start to consider answering the post for the "Successful Wall Street type seeking mutually beneficial relationship - $4,000/month."   But then I find a little gem in the "Strictly Platonic" file of the "Up late, wanna chat?" variety. I instant message him. We really hit it off. We talk until the sun comes up. He wants to meet. I'm hesitant. After successfully blowing him off for a week, I end up meeting him at a bar after work. His friends are there, too. I have a good time. He ends up being cute and he buys me a couple drinks. Around 2 a.m., he decides to head out, so I follow him. I walked with him for a few blocks, but then it's decision time. Turn down 6th Street toward my apartment or continue up Avenue A arm-in-arm with him? I decide to go home. We part ways, and I give him a kiss on the cheek.  Of course, when I get home I immediately sign on to AIM and pull up CL. He gets home shortly after I do. He tells me he wished I'd gone home with him. I'm sort of surprised by this, but it piques my interest. He tells me he'll pay for the cab to Williamsburg if I'll come over. I think about it -- I say yes.  I arrive in Williamsburg. I'm nervous. He can tell. He takes my coat and puts in on a hanger. He offers me a glass of water. I start to say dumb things, attempting to delay the moment when he'll decide it's time to kiss me. I say, "Do you have any gum? I had a cigarette on the way over." He says: "I don't care about that." And starts to kiss me. He's a good kisser. I lay back on his silk sheets, which are cool and smooth. And that's when my "Strictly Platonic" turned into a "Casual Encounter."

      You know ... I just realized that this blogging thing probably isn't a good idea, so this may be my last one. I know I've only posted three (including this one), but I've decided that people with things to hide probably shouldn't keep a blog. Somehow, it doesn't seem smart.   I can be persuaded to keep on blogging, but it'll take quite an argument. Until then, I'm going to keep things under wraps.   J.    So today on the phone, my boyfriend told me that this girl he used to have sex with while we were apart left a message on his machine. Now normally this would be somewhat upsetting. I mean, I wouldn't freak about it, but I wouldn't like it either. But this time, something's different. This time I want him to call her back.   Backstory: My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. We met online, which means our entire relationship is built on many long and involved conversations, long flights across the country and mini weekend vacations of fun and adventure. It also means that we've spent five long years in a long-distance relationship. So, obviously, we've broken up and gotten back together numerous times. He's the only one I've ever "been" with. But I am not his only one. I've often wondered what it would be like to be with someone else, so when I moved to New York, I finally got a chance to quench that thirst. Yes, that means I'm a cheater. (Please don't hate me.)   So I spent some quality time with this guy in New York. He turned out to be an asshole (surprise, surprise). He turned out the be the kind of guy who doesn't call you back. Hell, he doesn't even IM you back. And this gives me new perspective on my boyfriend's recent machine message from Kat (that's her name. perfect, right?). Normally, this message would be upsetting. But this time (yes, she's called before), I want him to call her back. I want him to be a gentleman - unlike the guy I met in New York. I want to know that my boyfriend is the type of guy who would call a desperate girl back if she left a message on his machine. Is that so much to ask?   But, because my boyfriend is, in fact, a gentleman, he refuses to call her back because, "that wouldn't be fair to you, honey." God, I feel like such an asshole.  It wasn't supposed to be this way.   Since I can remember, I've had a plan for my life. My entire journey has been spelled out like those directions that come with the partical board furniture you buy at Wal-Mart. You know, the kind that looks like real wood, but isn't real wood. Most people don't read those directions, but I do.   So I've always had this plan ... And I guess the plan worked pretty well until, like that cheap furniture, it started giving out and finally collapsed.   You have to understand that I'm not an overachiever or anything. I just do one thing that leads to another ... I follow my own directions.   I hated high school, but somehow I managed to accomplish just about everything you can accomplish. My resume is sick ... student council, Girls State, Tomorrow's Leaaders, state Senate intern, cheerleader, Presidential Classroom, AP courses. I'm not sure how I managed to get all of this done. I must not have breathed in high school.   So, needless to say, I had no trouble getting into college. I went local, that way I was a big fish in a big pond. The formula seemed to work in high school, so I kept it up. I picked a major and stuck with it for four years, picking up another one along the way. Not to mention everything else — college newspaper, President's Leadership Class, Campus Activities Council, a sorority, summer internships. Eventually, I was the editor of the newspaper and was named named the Outstanding Senior in the College of Journalism. And on my 22nd birthday, I got my acceptance letter from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Perfect, right?   After a summer in Boston working for the Globe, I moved to New York. I started my master's, made wonderful new friends, entered a world I had never known before ... and apparently got lost in it ... so lost, in fact, that I made a dreadful mistake.   My entire life I have had a plan. That plan never failed me. It always worked. I always got me what I wanted. But somehow, I had forgotten to plan what happened after graduate school. And in doing that, my plan collapsed.   You wouldn't think a small thing like this could derail such a determined and ambitious girl ... but it has. And now I feel stuck, like I can't get out. Somehow I need to get a new plan and get back on track.

      I was looking over my blog entries from the past few weeks. It's really amazing how far I've come in such a short time, and I think my evil ways are really starting to be in the past.  I have made a conscious effort to shift my focus toward work and other related projects, and I think it's really helping me put my unhealthy tendencies to rest. This weekend, I intend to write two tech-related stories that I'm going to pitch to our tech editor. I also just agreed to help with a hefty documentary project, and I'm really excited about diving into something so time consuming.  The professor gig is looking more and more like a reality, which will give me an additional place to put my energies. I've also reconnected with a handful of friends, and I plan to have lunch with a few of them in the coming weeks. Plus, one of my best friends may move here in July. And I can't wait to start hanging out with him. (Don't worry, he's gay.)  There is still a problem I will eventually have to confront: Matt. He still messages me from time to time, and I know he'll expect to hang out soon. That's when I'll have to tell him that I am more committed than ever to my boyfriend and hanging out with him is no longer an option. I just dread that conversation.  Side note: There is one encounter I have not yet confessed to. A little over a week ago, I went out drinking with coworkers. We got pretty drunk, and I came home in a cab. Then I got online and got on craigslist. I ended up going over to Philip's house. Who's Philip, you ask? Beats me. But he had the coolest apartment I've ever seen. I even told some of you about it. But it wasn't my coworker's apartment, it was Philip's. I spent the night at Philip's and left around 9 the next morning. We just kissed, not much more. He e-mailed me the next day and said "thanks." I haven't heard from him since, and I don't really want to.

      I just got back (literally) from DC, where I spent the weekend visiting my boyfriend. It was fantastic! First, we ate lunch at Cheesecake Factory. Then we went back to his place, where we promptly had sex. Then we went out with his friends, which (we both agreed) was pretty boring. BUT, we saw "Dodgeball," which was hilarious. (Please, do yourself a favor and go see it.)  On the way home from his friend's apartment, I took care of his business while he drove. When we got home, we had some more sex. The next day, we ate brunch with his entire family for Father's Day. The restaurant was great; his dad was a dick; and we played footsie underneath the table.  When we got home, we hopped in the pool, had sex in the pool, took a shower, had sex in the shower, dried off, had sex on the bed. Then we got some dinner, had sex and went to bed. I definitely didn't want to leave this morning. I can't wait until he lives in New York. I miss him already.

      Today at work, I accomplished something. I got a Gmail account.  I finally decided what to swap on gmailswap.com -- Beanie Babies! As soon as I posted my swap, I had three takers. I ended up going with a guy in West Virginia, and I'm so glad I did.  Here's what he said:  I just told my daughter about her new collection of animals that will be coming in the mail and she is so excited. She is 8 years old and to see those little blue eyes sparkle is a good feeling. I told her that there were 3 bears and she would have to wait and see what the other animals were, which is nice because it will be like a Christmas gift and kinda make up for the few gifts she got around the holidays. Social Security has done all they can to spoil alot of things the last few years. I want to thank you again for the deal and am glad I was in the right place at the right time for a change. Take care and God Bless!  I can't think of a better way to get my new Gmail account. Yay!

      Yes, that's right. I want a following. I want people who check in from time to time to see what I'm writing on this thing. I want people to hold me accountable for all the promises I make on here. I wonder how I can do that? How does one acquire a following?  I'm quite jealous of my friend, because his blog has a loyal readership. He's been working at it for more than a year now, so I guess I just need to be patient. Maybe lots of people are reading it, and I just don't know because they don't comment. Of course, I'm not nearly as animated in my blogs entries. But I can work on that. Apparently, I just need some drugs.  If you do actually read this thing, please say a quick "hello." I'd love to hear from you. Thanks.

      Lucky me. A new airline has started flying routes along the East Coast at super low prices, breathing new life into my long-distance relationship. Now Anthony and I will probably be able to see each other every weekend. And that only leaves the weekdays to be bad.   The airline is Independence Air ... and they have an iClub (frequent flier program) where you can earn iPoints. iLike it. The rules are simple. Book your flight -- $49 one way from NYC to DC or about $115 roundtrip. If you decide to change your reservation, it's $25 -- that's it. They don't overbook, so you're guaranteed a seat. Once you earn 1500 iPoints you get a free roundtrip flight to anywhere they fly at anytime you want to go. No special window times or any of that shit. I think this is most excellent, and I hope they are in business forever and ever.  So, I'm planning my first trip on this nifty airline for mid-July. That's when me, my iBook and my iPod will fly the friendly skies on iAir. I can't wait.   ***  Meanwhile, I may be getting a Gmail account. Keep your fingers crossed. Anthony's friend has an "in." I'm pulling for jennifer@gmail.com or jenniferjohnson@gmail.com. Man, it really sucks to have such a common name. But how fucking rad will it be if I actually get one of those addresses? Extremely.

      I can feel myself making progess -- and it feels good. For the past two days, I've woken up well before noon. It's been nice to actually get things accomplished, even if they're just small things like mailing letters and writing e-mails to long-lost friends.  I blocked Aaron last Friday, and I haven't looked back since. That also feels really good. He wasn't worth the time; although I admit I did enjoy the part where I pretended to be Brooke. Should've stopped there. Why do I always have to look for the best in people? Ah well.  Anthony and I are better than ever, and I'm headed to DC on Saturday to spend the weekend with him. I can't wait.  The only problem I have right now is Matt. It's strange, but as soon as I decided to quit my escapades, he starts messaging me consistently every night wanting to know if we can hang out soon. I need to put an end to it, but I'm not sure how. And I don't want to be like Aaron, even though I think that's probably impossible.  My current plan is just to fade out and hope he forgets about me. But with his recent messaging, that may prove more difficult than expected. We shall see ...

      I'm an honest person. I think my friends appreciate the fact that I will answer their questions openly and honestly. I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I cringe when I end up lying to someone. (Although I've been doing a lot of that lately.)  But rarely do I find a person who is willing to be as honest and open in return.  So far, I have only found one person who can be that real with me. (You know who you are.)   For me, being honest brings disappointment. Disappointment because the other person isn't willing to rise to the same level of honesty. I'm not sure what holds them back, but I wish it would go away.  Nothing hurts more than someone who holds back after you've been completely honest with them.

      The park is a funny place in New York City.   On a sunny day, a Manhattan park is transformed into a beach where pigeons replace seagulls and pale New Yorkers bare their bodies for a chance at a tan.  Everyone is pale and you have to wonder where so many people found beach chairs in the city. And how they expect to get a tan in jeans and a long-sleeved shirt. Girls in bikinis long for a shore, but settle for the park's barren grass. It's the sun they want, and they'll take it anyway they can get it.  Old men sit on towels with their shirts off. Their gray curly hair thick on their chests, their crack peeking out through their pants.  A guy who obviously isn't from New York wears bathing suit trunks and backwards hat and attempts to toss around the football with his very New York girlfriends. Somehow you know he wishes he were back home with a beer and a girl who knew how to make the ball spiral. Because his girlfriend just can't get it right, and she doesn't have much patience.  Still others find a perfect spot in the shade and curl up with a book, the Times or their iPod.  On this day, a New York girl trusts another New York girl enough to ask her to watch her towel while she runs to the bathroom.  But no one can leave behind the trappings of the outside world. Cell phones ring constantly as people make plans for Saturday night and sip their Starbucks coffee.  A crowd gathers around the dog park, because today is the Eastminster Dog Show in Tompkins Square Park - where every dog in a champion and awards go to most annoying bark.  And in the middle of the park, a lonely girl occasionally looks up from her laptop, hoping to spot a boy she shouldn't even be looking for.

      Vanessa:  I've known you for a long time. I've seen your wedding photos, and even called your phone number. You don't know me; we've never met. But we have someone important in common.  For almost 10 years, he has been a constant source of guidance for me. He has shared in my successes, pushed me toward my goals and, when necessary, pointed out my shortcomings.  He listens to my stories, and when I come undone, he pulls me back together.  We laugh, share jokes, opinions, problems. Sometimes he lectures me on my finances, and I try to get him to open up to me.  He's one of my best friends, and it's possible he might say the same about me. I'm not sure.  Yesterday it became clear that I probably would never have the chance to meet one of my best friends -- because of you. Because you might not approve of our friendship.   I probably always knew this, but today it hit home. When I was 15, it seemed like one day I would meet him, but with every day that passes, I see that opportunity disappearing.  I just wish you knew how much he meant to me.  J.

      I'm referring to myself.  Tonight, Aaron messages me. The conversation starts out nice enough. He seems friendly, so I invite him to come out with me and my friends tomorrow night.  His reply:  AMSD1980: "I'd really just like another bj. I don't wanna do all the chatting and hanging out crap."  What the fuck? How could I have wasted so much time on this guy? How could I have kept going back for more?  I'm a fucking idiot. Somewhere along the way, my priorities got completely fucked up. So fucked up that I actually considered, even if for a brief moment, going back over there to give him what he wanted.   This is not who I used to be. What happened?   I'm so lost.

      So I've finally been blocked by Aaron. I fully expected this to happen a long time ago. It's very curious though. He blocked my JenniferNYCity name, but not JennWSJ. And before you ask, yes, I'm sure he knows both screen names. Maybe he doesn't mind keeping the Wall Street Journal part of me around.   Interesting ...  ======================================  There are a million attractive guys in New York.  But I don't think the ones I'm attracted to are from New York. My guess is they are from Texas, California, Michigan, Florida. They don't have that New York look, and that's probably what I like about them. They have beautiful faces and great smiles. New York guys have sharp faces that are more scary than anything else. And who would want to wake up next to something scary in the morning? On the other hand ... Anthony is from Brooklyn. Seems there are exceptions to every rule.  ======================================  When did people stop dressing up at the office? Don't get me wrong. I really like that I can wear jeans to work. But sometimes you want to feel like you're in a professional environment, and that's really hard to do when people are wearing flip-flops.  Today, one of the interns wore the most hideous outfit. I mean, c'mon, you just graduated from an Ivy League school, can't you find something decent to wear? It was too short, too revealing and too wrinkled. I can deal with one of those, but all of the above is a problem.  I don't want to see stomachs, bra straps or your thong when I'm trying to put out today's news. Thank you very much.

      So, I've started setting these new goals for myself. Goals that will help me become a better person.  I'm pretty excited about some of them. There are others I just think I need to do.  But I've already started to notice the response from friends -- particularly online friends. It seems that if I don't have something juicy and dramatic to discuss with them, then they're not interested. They were happy talking to me when I was confessing my sins and struggling with who to be.   Now that the conversation has turned to volunteering and exercise, they seem like they could care less. Figures.  I know it's boring, but they could at least act supportive. I even got a "whatever" out of one of my friends today. Not good.  There's got to be something in between. One day I'll find the balance. I don't want to become boring. That would be the worst.

      To block or not to block, that is the question ... of the evening anyway.  So I'm trying to get rid of all the evil forces in my life. I figure my buddy list is a perfect place to start. But I'm finding it more difficult that I expected.  Why start with the buddy list?  Well, I figure there are a few people on that list I shouldn't be talking to. In fact, it would be better if I wasn't aware of their online presence. Because when they are online I become consumed with the question of whether to message them -- or whether they'll message me. It's a huge distraction. Plus, it's not normal or healthy.  So I'm torn. If I simply remove them from view, there is still that chance they could message me, while at the same time removing the nagging question of whether I should message them. But really that's cheating. If my goal is to get rid of the evil forces in my life, then that's what I should do -- get rid of them, block them for good.  So yesterday, I took Aaron off my buddy list. Then, I put him back on. Then, I blocked him. Then I unblocked him. Then I only blocked one of his names and left the other one unblocked. Not sure why I did that, but there was a good reason at the time. (Side note: I do all of this blocking/unblocking on three different AOL names I have for myself. So it's actually a pain in the ass.)  Then today I decided Aaron wasn't enough. So I took every person I ever met through Craigslist off my buddy list. And then I took off every person I ever had romantic/stalkerish impulses toward. I didn't block any of them, just removed them. I didn't have very much trouble with that. As of right now, they're all still off the list.  But Aaron's back on ... can't figure out why he won't go away. Maybe I'm not ready to let it go yet.

JenniferNYCity (6:04:44 AM): i'm trying.   Now that I think about it ... it's really funny that Back to the Future was showing as Matt and I ate breakfast at our hotel room in Jersey. Because at this very moment, I would give anything for a time machine.  My mistakes over the past few weeks have been some of the worst in my life, and I want more than anything to erase them. Anthony is one of the most important things to me, and I have betrayed him in the worst possible way. I don't deserve him, that's for sure. I have lied repeatedly. I have repeated past mistakes. And I think I now finally know when to stop.  Today was supposed to be the day I become a better person. Well, I didn't do terribly. I sent e-mails to friends. I planned two trips to DC to see Anthony. I signed up for an orientation with NY Cares, a volunteer organization. I worked an eight-hour shift, and I changed my cell phone to a New York number.  But I also sent an e-mail that invited Aaron back into my life. Possibly my only mistake today, but a huge one.  But I have to stay on course. I am done disappointing people. Done disappointing myself. I am supposed to be an example, someone to look up to. Not this pathetic, weak woman who can't say no.  No, it won't be as fun to read, won't be as entertaining. But this is a long time coming ... and it will certainly be interesting to see if I succeed or fail.

      So I woke up this morning in a hotel room in Secaucus, N.J., next to a guy I barely know.   That's not a sentence I ever thought I would be able to write.   Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a one-night stand. I've been with him before. But really, I don't know that much about him. We've slept together four or five times, each time very pleasant.   It never bothered me before that he wasn't as affectionate in the morning as he had been the night before. I don't know what I expected this time, but somehow I was disappointed. This morning, I wanted him to roll over, wrap his arms around me and give me kisses. But, of course, that's not what happens between people who just sleep together.   Why is everything always so clear the morning after? If I knew I would feel the way I do now, I never would've been with him last night. I mean, I had a good time. The sex was great. He even had breakfast delivered to the room this morning. But all I can think is, I miss Anthony. He is the one I want to wake up next to every morning. He's the one I want to roll over and kiss, even with our morning breath. I love him, and nothing I do with any other guy can really change that.  There will never be anyone like him.  Maybe it took me a lot of mistakes to realize this, but at least I have. And now I can do something about it. I don't want to be a cheater anymore. I just want to love Anthony with all of my heart, because he's the one. And Lord knows, I should spend the rest of my life treating him with the same respect he has always given me. He deserves nothing less.  Today is the day I become a better person. Wish me luck.

      So tonight, someone I don't know all that well put me in my place. They said things that were so true. I guess it takes a stranger to see you for who you really are. For me, that is apparently a liar and a cheat.  The words stung. And I want to be strong enough to make them untrue. But I'm not, not yet.  It's not the first time I've heard those words. And I can't help but think of all the times I must have disappointed people by my actions.   Sure, I'm ambitious. I'm funny and clever at times. I'm goofy and people like to laugh at the drama I create. But I'm disappointing. I disappoint myself over and over again. And I can't stop.  Part of me is so good and wholesome and innocent, but there's this other side. And I don't want it to go away completely, but it would be nice if it toned itself down.  What the hell am I going to do? I could potentially be engaged to someone in less than three months, and I'm still fucking around, doing stupid shit. I could ruin everything. Do I want to? Is it a way out for me? Am I too chickenshit to tell the truth, even though I've tried so many times? Or do I really think he is the best person for me - that there is no one better than him. Why am I so afraid to be honest with myself? Why can't we try on other people while we're serious with someone? It would be so much easier. You wear new shoes to go shop for more new shoes. You'll always have a favorite pair, but sometimes you like to try on something new. It could work the same way, maybe ....  There's something deep inside of me, and it motivates me to do really bad things. I'm hurting myself; I'm hurting people who care about me. I want to stop. But part of me enjoys my sinful behavior. I even tried to talk him into delaying his move to New York when I was on the phone with him tonight. Why did I do that? When I want him here more than anything in the world.  I need to get my shit together, and I need to do it soon. Otherwise this whole thing could blow up in my face. I just want to erase all my mistakes. Shit, I'd probably make them again.

      Yesterday, I was on Broadway up near Columbia University. I thought it would be fun to see my old neighborhood and remember what it was like to be a student there. On my journey, I discovered something horrible -- the closing of Columbia Bagel. They were closing their doors for the last time as I walked by. A slab of butcher paper with signatures from loyal patrons and Columbia students covered the doors and windows. The Westside Market next door was closed, too. And the Chinese place next door. Apparently someone bought the building and raised the rents. A sad New York reality. But I felt this one personally ...  I would stop by this little hole-in-the-wall almost every day for a bagel or coffee or bottled water. They were open 24 hours a day. They knew me by name, and they knew what I liked.   The perfect coffee at Columbia Bagel got me through all-nighters when my master's thesis deadline loomed. The guys behind the counter didn't even laugh when I paid for my bagels with nickels and dimes because I'd foolishly spent my last few bucks on a pack of smokes. (Hey, I was waiting on my financial aid to kick in.)  They had the best cinamon-raisin bagels in the city, and the coffee was served light and sweet and way too hot.  I drank CB coffee while I watched Anthony dig his car out of the snow in Riverside Park. I ate CB bagels while I worked customer service at UncommonGoods. It was the first place where everybody knew my name.  So, Columbia Bagels ... I don't live in the 'hood anymore, but I'll miss you. Thanks for the 20 years of bagels and memories.  ----------------------------------------------------  On an unrelated note: There needs to be a limit on how many previews can be shown before a movie. I went to see "Troy" at the Lincoln Center Loew's on Friday, and they must have been trying to set some kind of record. It got so bad that the audience started groaning loudly and throwing popcorn and who knows what else at the screen. To top it off, I was there to see "Troy" (a shitty three-hour movie).  Apparently, these movies are coming to a theater near you:  Spiderman 2 (bring it on. I'm ready.) Harry Potter (Ron gets the girl) Oceans 12 (the whole cast is back for another round) Riddick (just don't go see it) Terminal (do we really have to watch Tom Hanks trapped in another small place?) Stepford Wives (all-star cast, but looks like a bust) King Arthur (no.) Catwoman (meow. Halle looks hot.) Constantine (Keanue didn't get enough of Satan in "The Devil's Advocate") Vanity Fair (Reese attempts to prove she can really act)

      What a fuckin' week. It's been full of ups and downs. The most exciting thing is I had my first byline on WSJ.com, which is competely rad and will cause me to be on a high for many more days to come. I also contributed to several pop up graphics and (hopefully) made an impression on some important people at work.    The lows ... Anthony and I got into a huge fight over something. I'm not even sure anymore. I think mostly I was pissed because he always has a negative attitude about visiting me here. It's no secret he dislikes New York. But he's supposed to move here, and it's really hard to deal with him when he acts like I'm forcing him to move here. If he doesn't like New York, maybe we should break up. Because this where I live now, and I'm not leaving -- ever.    So Matt text messaged me tonight. He wanted to hang out. I was all for it. He was playing poker with some guys from work, so it was 3 a.m. before we finally met up. We decided to meet at his apartment. It was so great. He put his arm around me as we both sat in his oversized computer chair and looked at my byline (see above). Then he showed me the stuff he'd been working on at his job (www.nikegridiron.com), and we joked about how we're taking over the Web.     Then we made out in the aforementioned chair. Then we moved to the bed. He looked me in the eyes, told me he how much he liked my body, brushed my hair out of my face, kissed me intently. You can figure out the rest ...    I REALLY like him. But I know he's going through a lot of stuff that I can't even begin to imagine. Someone paged him at 4:30 a.m. He looked at his phone and threw it back on the dresser. Something's not right there. I know he's having issues with an ex and his family. But I don't ask. I just stay quiet and remain as perfect an angel as possible. After the sex, he kissed me for awhile and then whispered in my ear: "Hey, I want you to know that your byline is really great, and I'm really glad you came over, too." When is he going to stop being so goddamn perfect?

      Why can't I get a grip on this? I thought I was on the right track. I told Matt we just needed to be friends; he was a perfect gentleman about it. I hadn't even thought about Aaron (or any other guy for that matter) in a really long time -- or at least what seemed like a really long time.     But now I can't stop thinking about Matt. Is it because I know I can't have him? Is it because he's growing on me? Is it because I'm unhappy other places in my life? Is it because he excites me?    Ack. I hate this. It's a constant struggle to stay on the right path. I just want to be good. I am seriously in love with my boyfriend. And I'm not just saying that to convince myself. He truly makes me happy. And he is a wonderful person. I could never hope to find a better man to spend my life with.     But, of course, I always manage to create drama. And I guess this inner struggle is it for the time being. I want to shake it off. I want to be good and not have to think about being good. I don't want to have to make such an effort. Shouldn't it come naturally? And yet, when I see a smart, attractive guy ... I'm hooked. I can't help but flirt with the idea of trying him on, too. What the fuck is wrong with me? Nothing, probably. But I really need to get this thing in check. Anthony could give me a ring in a day or a year. Either way, I need to be emotionally ready. Right now, I'm not. And I hate it, but I love it. God, I'm so fucked.

      Yes, that's right. I do. They're awful. No, not to me. To him.  To me they are kind and generous, although a little awkward. They struggle to make conversation, but they are always full of smiles and compliments. But apparently, that's just an act.  So his family went on a cruise this week. Yes, his entire family went on a cruise ... without him. But that's OK, because we spent the weekend together, and we probably had more fun in a big empty house than he would've without me on a big crowded boat.  He was invited to go, but he was invited to go on THE day his mom was buying tickets. "Hey, we're going on a cruise next week. Can you get that week off of work?" Uh ... no. I mean, when your dad is a VP in the company, he can get off work easily. And when your little brother is a college intern, no problem. But when you're a middleman, you can't just up and go on vacation without a little notice.  So they go on the cruise, and today they return. I'm on the phone with Anthony when his dad knocks on the door and says angrily, "Get off the phone and help your brother with the luggage." Uh, right. I didn't get to go on the weeklong cruise, but let me stop everything I'm doing and help you with your heavy bags. Oh, and by the way, nice to see you, too.  Geez. It pisses me off. I have NEVER known a family life like that, and I'm glad I never have to. But one of those days, those people will be my in-laws, and I just don't know if I can take it.

      I thought I had really made progress. I was totally focused on my boyfriend. I hadn't spend time with any other guys, nor had I invested any time forging new relationships with guys.  I had gone to see him in D.C. once and had plans to see him again this weekend.  Our conversations were oozing with lovey-doviness, the kind that make you cringe if you're unlucky enough to overhear.  But then Matt started IMing me. It was just a "hi" here or a "what's up?" there. Then he IM'd and wanted to hang out. We had already discussed my new devotion to my boyfriend, and we decided we could totally handle being just friends.  I was optimist, but in the back of my mind, I knew what would happen.  First mistake was choosing to hang out at a bar.

      So today my roommate asks me, "Jenn, would you be interested in splitting the cost of a maid?"  Are you fucking kidding me?  First of all, our apartment is the size of a shoe box. Have we gotten so lazy that we can't clean up after ourselves? In Oklahoma, we manage to have entire houses without having a maid. Why do a single 30-year-old guy and his 24-year-old temporary roommate need one?  Secondly, I am scraping by in this town as it is. I would rather spend money on more important things like a high-speed Internet connection, cable, air conditioning or alcohol. If we got a maid, the floors may be clean enough to eat from, but I wouldn't be able to afford the food.  So I have a solution. Why doesn't he just waive the rent in exchange for my cleaning services? Hmm ... wonder if he'd actually do that ...

      So what happens when you find yourself clicking with someone else's boyfriend?  That's what happened to me tonight. I found myself totally into my friend's boyfriend. And he was totally into me. I don't know much about him, other than he's 29, from Northern Virginia and works for Bear Stearns. (Nice.)   I met up with some old friends from an internship I had a couple years back. We had a really great time. The conversation was flowing easily. We were laughing, talking about every subject -- from work to relationships. It was a nice change of pace.   And as the conversation continued I found myself clicking with this guy more and more. We'd say things at the same time -- the same jokes. And when that would happen ... eye contact, smiles. (He had a nice one.) He was smart, a smart ass, too.   It got uncomfortable how often he would look me in the eye and smile. Like I'd just won over his heart.  And when the evening ended, he made sure to put me in a cab first. He took care of me, like you do with someone you care about. How strange.   I think life is amazing. How it can take you down a road you never knew existed until you experienced it. I'm certain nothing will come of this. I still love my own boyfriend more than ever. It's just nice to know you can click with someone -- especially an attractive, seemingly successful someone.
