           This is, of course, my first posting.  I went to go see the new Exorcist movie tonight.  I don't know why I do this to myself.  I won't be sleeping until daylight.  I'm not particularly afraid at the moment.  The fear won't really set in until the tv is off and the lights are out.  There seems to be something about unnatural body movement and the forces of evil that just doesn't sit well with me.       In other news, I've really done nothing significant with my weekend.  This is, afterall, the part of the week that I live for, so, normally, I like to have plans.  I thought that I would sort of let things fall into place this weekend, instead of making plans.  The end result was that both Friday and Saturday night, I didn't really getting ready until around 11:00 pm.  I didn't really give myself enough time to have a productive night.  I did however, spend the entire morning with the cable guy who came to install my high speed internet.  He kept talking to me, he swore that he knew me from somewhere, maybe the mall.  I explained to him that I haven't lived here for the better part of the past five years.  I thought maybe he recognized me from high school, but he graduated seven years ahead of me, in that case, I really hope he doesn't know me from high school.  I don't have much patience for prowlers.       Anyway, having spent so much time with him, I really felt like I got to know him.  Our casual conversation led to a very awkward goodbye.  I didn't know whether or not to lean in for a kiss.  In the end, I just gave him a check for my first month's service.  I think we did the right thing...No, just kidding, we never got that close at all...he's just the cable guy, a stranger in my home.       After the internet was up and running, I frittered my valuable day away on various web sites, trying to find a different job, trying to relocate, trying to find a way out of Bay City.  I don't know how successful I was.       In any case, I should go to bed soon so that I can get all my good nightmares in before morning.
