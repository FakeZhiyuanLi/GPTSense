      Hey, I guess this is my first thingy so...   Today I went to church and stuff, now I'm talking to Sharon on the phone and later I'm going to church again...  Its so You_Rocket Summer Its a beautiful day,  Now Ill be ok  Now that you're not away Yesterday was a terrible day,  but now that you're here Im ok.  Cause you don't know how much I,  I need you please, dont go You're so wonderful  This I swear, this I know  You, oh, you, Every single thing you do  I'm so proud of you  What you do When you do the things you do  They're so you  So thanks, for your heart You shine so bright You are the star thats in my sky and I am yours and you are mine.  Whoa, you, whoa you,  Every single thing you do,  I'm so proud of you. What you do,  When you do the things you do,  They're so You.  This is a story by Sharon Rose Korzek...... Once upon a time there wasa boy named Tim and he fell asleep on the phone. And then he tried to call back when he woke up but it didn't work.  And then Sharon went to bed and she didn't know what the boy did.   Second paragraph: Then she smoked cuetips, and her friend smokes banana peels. Then Sharon woke up from a dream that she had. It was about: There was a big big black room, and then Tim shot Sharon, then she woke up. But Tim didn't laugh at her. Then in her dream when she was awake because it's scary, Tim gave her dead body a pill and she woke up and was happy.  The Ending: They lived happily ever after in the dream.

      I think people are coming over today to hang out and watch a movie. SCHOOL OF ROCK that is. Hopefully, it'll be there and no one took the last copy yet. It'll be a fun time, kinda... I'm glad I have friends to take my mind off things that I'm constantly thinking about anyways.  Yeah all the time we've spent together talking, thanks cause you've left my heart broken. Maybe someday I'll forget how much you meant to me. Just to let you know, it's not fun waking up and realizing how lonely you are and then not being able to sleep the rest of the night. Sorry. I hope the next time I talk to you I don't see my eyes in yours.   You can sleep in your own bed tonight sleep away a silent pain that's screaming out my name,   you can sleep in your own bed tonight I hope for your sake that you don't wake up as broken as I am.    Sleep in your own bed tonight I know some day that you will wake up as  lonely  as I am  Have a good weekend.

      It's the worst feeling when you need to let go of someone you care for a lot. Things change though and when they do, you need to walk away. Even though it's a lot easier and yet harder thinking about what's happening, you need to focus on the times you spent together, talking, hanging out or doing whatever.   Do the Question of the Day.

      And maybe tomorrow wont be so hard, maybe I'll find another way to make the weekend pass by slowly. Sleep isn't to important until Sunday night. you make this all worth while. Today was pretty good actually, I got very little homework which is actually the best thing that's happened to me all week.  I don't have much to say today, I'll probubly write more tonight when the night is over. I'll catch you guys later.  Do the Question of the Week.

      Hey guys, I had an alright day. School, school, and a little more school. My first three hours of the day are the worst! Very boring, and I'm really tired because I always end up going to bed late even though I'll tell myself I need to go to bed early. Don't lose sight of what's important because when you do, it's hard to come back to that and focus on it. At least for me, I kind of blew off school for a while and now it's really hard to get back into the swing of things. I mean it happens, but it's becoming a pretty heavy responsibility. Not just school though, this can apply to anything. On a kind of happier note, I'm going over to Jordan's with Rich to record vocals. Hanging out with the cool kids...   Alright, I'm going to do a little something, something to make this a little more interesting...  Finish this sentence: The worst thing about ______ is _______. email me your answer and you might win something and I'll tell you my answer.

      Hey, I guess I'm going to try and start updating my blog more frequently, but you never know how I'm feeling. I just want to let you guys know that the band is going pretty good. I think we get along pretty well, which is a good thing. We've had two shows. First one was alright, first show... first show. Our second definately went a lot better than the other. We're really working hard on recording, we have everything done except vocals, which is going kind of slowly.   Anyways, I haven't been feeling very good for a while. I think I'm just getting sick of my daily routine, so the days have been going by really slowly. I really just need some change, something to wake me up from this never-ending dream. It's kinda like riding the bus, listening to emo music, looking out the window; kind of sad.

      Hey I have a secret project for the band coming up and only a few of us know. It'll be the biggest thing since the summer of 1969, since the Martha Steuart scandals, since the making of furbys... yes bigger than furbys. Not even the whole band knows about it, only one outsider... Well see what happens. Anyways, it's finally the weekend and it's awesome. I wasted most of my Saturday away though... Last night was the 88.1 Show at the summit. I think it was one of the best shows I've ever been to!   Basically what's going on with me is this. Things are getting better... I was about to get into big trouble because my biology teacher, Mrs. Caldwell, was gonig to call and tell on me cause whenever she asks me to come in for lunch I never do. That's school. I like this girl.   Well I had fun updating my blog for the first time in a week. Woah.  peace

      Hey guys, sorry about that last one. I was just kind of in a bad modd about some stuff. I tihnk I'm feeling better though. Today I went to church and hung out and then went to pizza hut with Nate and his family. Good day so far, but it seems this weekend has gone by way to fast. I did have a lot of fun. Friday, haning out with Nate and Amber. Saturday, Maddy, Jordan, Tanya, and Rich came over. I'm preparing myself for the week ahead of me today.  Could be fun but probubly not, I like it when you're expecting a terrible week and then it ends up being a lot of fun and going by really fast.  Last night I had an awesoem conversation with someone, it was really cool. I like talking to my friends on the phone about whatever, but I love talking to my friends about things that really matter... like important things. I don't know, I just don't have many friends I do that with so yeah it's cool. I was thinking about what kind of music The Great Basement Crusade plays and it really sounds like .... wedding music. Well atleast the slow songs. We have a lot of those cause I wirte a lot of the songs on my acoustic guitar. I would like to see what would happen at an acoustic show somewhere. That'd be cool.  Well I'm done writing because really I have nothing else to say. Were working on a new song which sounds really sweet! So I'll put the lyrics up on the site soon.  urlLink The Great Basement Crusade   I'll see you guys later.

       Excuse me , but the project has been cancelled! (Atleast for the time being) Oh well. sorry to burst all your guys bubbles. The band is going good, hopefully we'll have a practice on Thursday because I'm hopnig to go to the SBH show on Friday! It's Scott's birthday today which is sweet! I can't wait to see what kind of dum surprises he gets. Today was a pretty good day. I got caught for being on the phone last night with someone though. That sucked. Not the first time, but this time my rents are like I'm gunna have to talk to you, so I dunno what will happen.  Tomorrow... oh Tomorrow, stay away for one more day. Don't come, unless you don't mind not staying for a day. Maybe you'll pass by quickly. Progress reports coming home in two weeks. Ah! Hopefully I did better than last semester. Lately I've been really working hard but I don't really have anything to look forward to later on this wee, except the weekend. Oh, and Thursday.  I'm out. peace

      the perfect day, you wake up, the light of Faries in your eyes. the perfect way to follow up a time when all the other guys looked down on you, the only boy without a fairy in the land now take your sword, fight the evil wizard from the desert lands you travel put away your past now you can fly so high and paint the skylines, swim across a raging sea, mount up with wings like eagles, blast the dungeon find the key. draw your magic sword in the desert land, save the princess, win her heart. leave a legacy like any hero would, fade away into the stars. hit the ground but always you rise again, fearless of the loss of more. in your eyes I see my eternity, bleed your life until you soar. you're riding hard, make it to Gerudo before the sun sets. look at the stars, Saria's dreaming of you somewhere, you can bet. you're never far from those days you miss from oh so long ago. just play your song, and this hero will go marching home to all he once thought was the world but now you soar someday we'll be free I can see it now, angels trade harps for guitars. shake the walls and as they are coming down, fade away into the stars. sing it even stronger, hold it even longer, voice inside your head unfolds into a song and I just don't see what it is that draws you in to me  that songs by SBH(old old song. funny.)

      I think I'm done doing this for a while, way to much trouble. I don't really gain anything from it so... I'm done. Last Issue:  "For A While I Say "Goodbye"    I've been sick for the past three days with something weird. But I missed school for two days, Thursday and Friday. I wanted to go to the Sandbox Heroes show but I couldn't cause of sickness. grr. I hate it. Saturday I was feeling a little better, it was more around five when I felt good. I went out to eat with my good friend Amber. She's a cool cat. Then we went over to Rich's, he needed some guitar string or something so I brought it over there.   peace

        So tonight, the show was a lot of fun... Evan Baker, and Mercury Shoes rocked out. I really had fun. There was only one problem, this girl... she left early and I didn't like it. Anyways, other than that it was cool. Tomorrow will be another boring day. I think I'm leading worship for the thing tomorrow at the Hutton's. Yikes, I dunno what I'm gunna do. I'm not good at that kinda thing, leading, and I dunno. I'm going to try and get Evan to help me and play with me or something. Otherwise, I dunno if I'll do it. I was watching a bunch of bands music videos and I found the best one. It's the music video for "best of me" by The Starting Line. It's really funny.       Tonight, my life doesn't go much deeper than that.       Goodnight      ~Timmy

[Chorus] Well, it's love (It's love) Make it hurt (I deserve it) Well, it's love (It's love) Make it hurt (I deserve it) Well, itâs love, itâs love, itâs love... Make it hurt. I said I use the inconsistencies That undress the machine, You're the poster boy, their selling point, the focus for their new campaign. (Something has to be) Bound to come around about (Bound to come around) Oh, but canât you, canât you feel it rolling off your lips, Tensing up your shoulders, câmon... [Chorus] The keys to the castle (Are right where I left them)The princess walked in just to take more attention, 'Cause after all, well isn't that all that I've been after and, After all, well isn't that all that I'm after, You're so...(No way out) I give up in you, well, I give up in you, (No way out) I give up in you. (No way out) Well, I give up in you, I give up in you, (No way out) Well, I give up in you. I wanted you for nothing more, Than hating you for what you were, If that's what you wanted to hear, (Well, if that's what you wanted to hear) I wanted you for nothing more, Than hating you for what you were, (Don't leave, leave) If that's what you wanted to hear, (If that's what you wanted to hear) I wanted you for nothing more, Than hating you for what you were, (Don't leave, leave) If that's what you wanted to hear, (If that's what you wanted to hear) (It's love, it's love) I wanted you for nothing more, (Make it hurt, I deserve it) Than hating you for what you were, (If that's what you wanted to hear) That's what you wanted to hear, (To hear) If that's what you wanted to hear.

         Woah , I almost forgot I even had this. Lately, I've been really busy, well not really busy, but I've been active. This summers been great, it's flying passed so fast. I'm defaintely going to miss the summer when it's over. I was home alone all this weekend, it was really fun! I went to the SBH show in Grand Rapids with them and we stayed over night in Holland. Our friend, Danielle, lives there on a lake and stuff. Then I was hanging out with a bunch of people, but I was never really home alone.      &nbsp;  I don't really know how I'm doing though, even though all this fun stuff has been going on, I'm still not in a very good mood. Yeah, its awesome hanging out with friends and stuff, but I want something more. I've been thinking about this one girl that I really like but I dunno whats gunna happen with that. We don't really hang out alot or even at all but I think since I'm not as busy anymore I'll be working on doing more stuff with her.    &nbsp;  I've got it bad.    &nbsp;  ~Timmy

       This weekend I was in Canada... It was actually a lot of fun. On Friday and Saturday I went over to my cousins house and hung out with them for a while.  And on Saturday night I went over to my good friend, Amy's, house. I've known her all my life, and were really good friends. We jumped on the trampaline a lot. Her friends came over and one of them had a really weird name, Bronwin? haha... but she seemed cool. On Sunday we drove up to camp to see my brothers and for church at chapel point. I met some people and talked to some really old friends. Good stuff. Then Sunday night me and my dad drove home, eight hour drive. Terrible     t     he whole trip kinda made me wish i never moved away.          ~Timmy

       I just got home again from Canada... This was a longer stay though. I was up for from Friday until today. Anyways, I hung out with my buddy Amy, and my cousins and stuff so it was really cool. Saw lots of family and stuff. I didn't leave in a good mind though, I wasn't happy about some situations going on but I think I'm over it and stuff. I miss my friends Sharon, she's really cool... I like talking to her. Anyways, I like this girl though but I haven't seen her for a while so I dunno... but I really want to hang out with her soon. :when I was in canada I used my grandparents phoen a lot and I think I'll get into trouble when they get their bill: I really like the new Taking Back Sunday CD but I still like the old stuff better. I lost my CD though so I'm gonig to have to get it again somehow.       "Theres one thing I can do nothing about....." tbs      ~Tired of being lost.
