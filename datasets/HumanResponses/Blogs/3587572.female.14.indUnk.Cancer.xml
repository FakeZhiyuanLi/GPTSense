      istening to : cute little jeremy sumpter's voice in Frailty mood :dandy! current status : BORED!!     ouh kay.. so I don't know why.. my mom ajak me pergi shopping today.. out of the no where.. owh well.. so me and my mom and my auntie went shopping today! I was soo excited! KLCC some more.. heheheh.. KLCC + money + mom = new clothes and new shoes!!! right!?     WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!     guess what I found out when we reached there?     WE WERE SHOPPING FOR OFFICE CLOTHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!     it loosened my semangat already.. but.. u know.. optimistic.. I thought that.. 'okie.. it might be fun.. girls day out.. looking for OFFICE CLOTHES! u know.. it could be fun..'     It was okay at the beginning.. i got to help my aunt and mom find neat clothes.. and funky ones.. I never thought there were so many different types of suits.. oooo....     After lunching.. we went to this shop called the Edmundser.. sounds kinda cool.. I've been there a few times with my mom.. and from my experience.. It wasn't fun!!.. but here come the optimistic again..     Ok.. at first I helped my aunt find navy suits.. it was ok.. until we run out of navy suits to browse.. but my mom went SUIT CRAZY!! she was practically browsing through every baju in the store and I'm like.. MOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     ok.. at first it was ok! UNTIL WE SPENT ONE HOUR IN THE FREAKING SHOP!! I had nothing to look for.. I think going to the lingerie store would be FUNNER for me.. at least they have 14 year olds' stuff there.. here.. they don't have 14 year olds' office suits!! AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!     after that.. I just went haywire.. I got really tired.. my legs are killing me.. my brother macam giler menangis.. ARGH!! and thats just it..     when my uncle came pick us up! the only decent thing that happened to me today.. is that I got my roti BOY!! not even one decent blouse.. not even shoes.. NOT EVEN A MANGY BRACELET! I was sad.. and tired.. and frustrated..     but I got home and rushed to kids choice award. HILARY DUFF!! so that got me happy again..  - NOT EVEN A BRACELET!

U know what MALAYSIAN IDOL got me thinking!?      Am I that BAD when I sing?    Well.. my sister says I have bad tuning.. my voice I mean.. AAARRRGGGHHH!!

      no.. I'm not talking bout my cookies.. my cookies are perefectly fine! well, I didn't make cookies anytime recently so basically.. there are no cookies to be fine of! does that make sense?    so anyways.. I actually was talking about imran! who's that u ask!? he's just my innocent 1 year old baby brother who happens to be very cute like me.. hahahah.. so anyways.. back to the main point.. refering to my title.. we can all conclude now, that my cute baby brother imran, has got burnt..    ok ok! maybe burnt to the crisps is too strong.. coz he takdalah sampai kena rush to the hospital.. (well, we didn't anyway).. but still, he got burnt at the back of his neck.. It looks so painful and like.. icky and gross.. argh! I swear if that happened to me.. I'll go all berserk! I'll run around and call a taxi to the hospital right away.. thats only coz I like to exaturate but still its gotta hurt.. does crying VERY loudly tells you that!?    so anyways.. guess who was to blame for that!? NOT ME! thats for sure.. but guess who blamed me!? my MAID! thats right! the word maid and blaming DOES NOT go together.. thats right.. she's the MAID here.. and why? lemme tell you..    my 10 year old brother ajin just 'sunat'.. so anyways.. here I am running errands for that boy.. you know.. "angah I want air".. "angah the remote".. "angah I'm hungry".. "angah wheres my pokemon cards".. I'm telling you its starting to get to me.. who am I? your possy? (or however you spell those..) I'm like.. never nice to my brother.. (only when I want sumthing).. and here I am.. running up and down making sure he's all comfy and satisfied.. ARGH!!     so anyways.. his friend called and I went up to give him the phone.. and of course its only normal to wait there till he finishes coz I won't be coming up again just to put down his phone for him.. puh-lease.. so I waited up there.. when I put down his phone.. I was ready to go down again.. and thats when I heard the CRYING! freaked out of course!    I went down and I saw my maid running to her room carrying the crying baby? guess what I did.. ran after her duh! so anyways.. the whole time she was putting lotion on the baby.. she was like.. "haih.. adik kena minyak.." in that ungrateful tone.. you know.. one that has a hidden meaning saying "ITS YOUR FAULT! YOU TAK JAGA DIA WHEN UR SUPPOSE TO! AND HE CAME TO ME AND KENA MINYAK WHEN I WAS COOKING!" like puh-lease.. why is it my fault!? the baby was right there with you! YOU! YOU!! YOU THE MAID!! and I was upstairs doing favors for my brother.. I'm not superman you know.. I can't take care of both my brothers at the same time.. thats her JOB! she's paid to do that! I'm not! and I can't even take care of myself properly.. argh! bite me!    So now she doesn't wanna talk to me.. or hand me the baby. I was like.. "tak nak bagi sudah!" so I went back to my seat.. and sang my song LOUDLY!! that'll teach her.. hmph! whatever!    My brother just woke up now.. I wanna go see how's his doing with his well done skin.. hahahah.. (ok thats mean!).. bye!  - wasn't my FAULT you didn't take care of him properly..!

      listening to : Diffuser - I Wonder mood : getting less bored.. hey this thing does help!     ok.. this is a story of me and one faithful day I went to ashraf's house.. and his uncle came over..     as usual.. me and my two guyfriends always hang out at ashraf's place at nights for guitar playing.. (as if we don't have enough time with each other masa petang).. I had some work to do that night.. so I had to eat dinner pretty late.. just when I thought I could peacefully eat my tinned can szechuan soup.. shahir had to call me and invite me to go out.. reluctantly.. I agreed.. (even though I have Harry Potter on MTV screen that night..     so i cooked up my soup and brought it over to ashraf's..     the 3 of us just hang there.. me enjoying my soup.. and the guys playing guitar and at the same time feeling disgusted over my icky looking soup.. (which does not look icky by-the-way) .. its only the lighting and the fact that its brownish in colour.. doesn't make it look icky.. well it sure doesn't taste icky though.. thats for sure.. so./ ignore the yappy-doodle and just ate my soup..     10 minutes later.. ashraf's mom pull out of the driveway.. and along came his uncle and form 4 cousin! AAARRRGGGHHH!! I'm in my jammies for god's sake.. the uncle came up to us and was like.. "class guitar ker?".. we were all just putting on our sweet smile masks.. and seeing me being the only girl.. and the only one with a spoonfull of soup in my hand.. asked me "what is that!?".. I was just smiling and politely saying 'some sort of soup!" -being nicey and all next-door-girl type.. is hard.. (even though literally, I am the next door girl)- ARRGGHHH!! BITE ME!     so basically we just hung out that nite.. the uncle made a few visits outside.. asking us about guitars and insisting me on playing a P. Ramlee song! heylo! as much as I love to do that.. I just don't know how to.. I barely made it through "My Immortal".. and as I return what was left of my szechuan soup dinner.. I came back to ashraf's and hung out with the addition of his cousin.. (cute but nah..........)     and when I thought that was that.. I recently met up with his uncle again.. when he picked us up from tuisyen class.. he had to remind me of the soup! I was just smiling again.. his uncle made attempts to talk to me and made funny jokes.. and being the nice person I am (with grown ups) I laughed.. some of them were pretty funny though..     and 2 days ago.. me, ashraf and shahir went on our daily basis walk around the padang.. and ashraf's mom came to the padang to talk to ashraf.. and who else is better to be there than his 'joke man uncle'.. the minute I saw the uncle.. my feet just went jello.. (do I have to go to them? yeah DUH!) so ashraf's mom made him go have lunch at 6 o'clock.. the mom was insisting on taking us to the mamak store "asam pedas' near there.. and the uncle.. suggested I take him for a round of SOUP!! ARGH!!!!!!!!!! whats with the uncle and soups.. or in this case.. MY soup.. pirsh!!! weird... I'm starting to get creeped out by this person..     and tonite.. we hung out outside again.. and his uncle and mom came back from buying dinner.. both of them came up to me and commented on my 'WHOA LOOK AT THAT GIRL' hair.. I'm telling you.. Its starting to get to me.. just leave my hair ALONE!! and then.. guess what the uncle did! He invited me to dinner.. WHOA!!! I mean.. what the heck.. its nice and all.. but dinner.. I'm starting to think he's planning on my engagement with ashraf already!! puh-lease.. I sweetly declined and my body just went up to chills when he went in the house.. both of the guys teased that the uncle 'likes' me.. EEWWW!!! the uncle is not bad.. and I don't hate him.. he's not the type yg.. "HEY LOOK.. TEENGAE GIRL!" kinda type.. just the fact that.. he's been obsessed with all this.. and my soup! argh!!...  -LEAVE MY SOUP ALONE!!!!!!!!!

      listening to : sway, bic runge mood (I'll make a point to write this in every post) : BORED!!     the only decent thing thats been going on with me is my hair.. it looks nice right now..  since I am obsessed with hair styles.. once again I come up with ways to make my hair looks more.. shaped..     I have side-parted my hair.. and have braided it into little pieces.. you know.. like one of those black people's hair.. the one where you just braid ur whole hair kinda way.. yeah.. my hair is like that rite now.. just messier.. but it looks good.. one of those moments when I kinda agree to the fact that I look.. nice..      Mom said having my hair parted at the side makes me look.. grown up! heylo! whats wrong with that!? I think I look really nice having my hair side-parted.. despite anyone's comment.. ok.. or maybe until after about 20 "U LOOK UGLY IN THAT HAIR" comment..     Is it me.. or up till I'm ADDICTED to side parted hairs, a lot of stars have been having that style.. and EMMA! OMG! have you seen her hair! If I was a guy.. I'll definitely fall for her.. (though its not like none other 10 million guys in the whole world doesn't).. AARRGGHH!! but it still looks SOOO DAMN PRETTY!! I just love her hair!!     So right now.. I'm just waiting for another 5 days before I can un-tie these little braidies thats in my head.. and It'll come out like how I want to.. (and by this, I don't mean Alicia Key's).. sorry to her.. but her hair in her single.. You Don't Know My Name.. is just.. revolting! horrible! I think cats look better.. and I don't like cats!     Having my hair braided like this, I've been getting "WHOA LOOK AT THAT GIRL!" reactions.. Isn't this normal!? heylo! Its called stylin'! Just today.. My mom invited all my uncles and their lovey-dovey families) to come have dinner at our place.. and all my uncles and aunts gave this.. "ARE YOU SURE WE DON'T NEED TO RUSH YOU TO THE HOSPITAL" look! PUH-LEASE!! sweet smile is always a good mask!  - Is it wrong to have FUNKY hair?

I like the song.. but I can't really comment on it until I hear the guitar..'  miza : 'the song was nice.. but you had your voice like.. mendatar.. all the same.. tak leh tahu which one is chorus and bridge.. so u have to like.. 'dub' in your voice to make it different..  atikah : 'it was nice lar..'  diana : 'its a nice song! I like the lyrics.. and the aight..aight..aight.. part was weird..'  zaty : 'the song was like avril's.. and your voice like sama jer semua.. but the song is nice..'  melisa : 'I couldn't hear you.. hahah.. but I just tak suka sgt the song coz it didn't come from you.. you kinda take parts of different different songs and put it together..'  nadhirah : 'nice'  shameen : 'the song is nice.. but your voice is kinda like.. u know..'  along : 'awesome.. the song is nice.. your voice is ok..'  ashraf and shahir : 'lets change some of the lyrics so we can fit it with this tune'  shahrul : 'shaky la sangat.. lama giler nak ready.. sounds like one of those azril's song.. anyway..the lyrics is nice dude.. and ur voice wasnt that bad as u claimed.. bukan ah teruk giler macam bila dengar rasa cam nak rosakkan this mic.. and u sang it 6 times!'  omar : 'ur song was good.. it was the 2nd horrible song i have ever heard.. ahahha.. it was ok.. are you waiting for me to praise you?.. it was good.. it was ok for beginner.. i mean your voice..'  me : I love it! and proud of it!

      listening to : avril's -my happy ending mood : fine current status : alone..   ok.. today wasn't as fun as yesterday.. lemme tell yah!  came to school.. late again.. so whats new.. I walked in and decided to just go to class since.. the bell dah rang and stuff.. nak pergi taman gemilang nanti lama sgt pulak.. so.. 'there I go.. there I go again..' Tan Yang caught me on the way and we walked together to class.. he asked me where my friends was and I pointed at atikah who was sitting there.. bruting at the tembok dpn her class tuh.. she was walking towards us and I was.. as usual.. laughing..   when we got to class.. I put my bag and stuff and happily hang out wth atikah outside class.. after a few minutes.. OMG!! we freaked out! there was no people.. the place was deserted.. I mean.. ok there was other people beside us.. but it wasn't as crowded as it's usual self.. there were no 'people coming to their classes' atmosphere there.. we were all.. "WHERE IS EVERYONE!!?"   then we heard some people going all.. theres perhimpunan.. "Owh now they tell us.." so we had to walk all the way back to the perhimpunan place.. scoffs.. so there we were looking like fools.. just joining the place yg basically semua org was there.. haih.. but I saw sc so it was ok.. hehehe.. so anyways.. we joined up with our 'clique' (hahhaha.. no lar.. to our group..) and I welcomed gg back with a HUG!! and she was nudging me to sing my song.. and diana too.. (and she heard it already) I was like.. 'nah...'   so we.. like yesterday.. lepak at the perhimpunan place whjile the school are saying BUH-BYE to some teachers thats retiring.. BOH-RING!! so basically we just talked and talked and they still kept nudging me to sing my song.. especially diana.. I was all.. 'guys its at the perhimpunan place.. people will hear..' and they were like.. 'takdelar.. cptlar cptlar..' so I got outnumbered and HAD TO sing my song.. and afters they made me sing again.. like 5 minutes after that.. I opposed.. I did get to hear gG's song 'have you ever'.. its nice.. as usual..   after that.. it was time to get back to class and we were invited to give the teachers a hug.. WOO-HOO.. I wanted to go but teh gals were like.. ' GO ajak SC lar.. he wants to go too..' and I was like 'no way!'.. but I went to say goodbye to her with melisa.. (pn. yap looks happy to bid us goodbye) [I.. bid you goodbye.. I cry.. with tears in my eyes.. ok ok!].. so we just went back to class.. we just was hanging out there..   nothing biggie event happened then.. we just went to kH where i got to finish my JAHITAN!! alleyluyah! but on the way.. the girls were like pestering me to sing my song again.. i was like ..' ok you guys.... ' in a sarcastic way..   so then thats basically just it.. then we went to recess.. where I gave nasriff the card.. he was thanking me and stuff.. and I was like.. ok happy birthday.. then I went back to our table where I sang my song to miza coz she didn't hear it the first time.. diana was bummed she didn't get to hear it when I sang it to miza.. so then we just hang out.. and had our recess.. masa balik.. I was SURPRISED!!   Bryan was sitting at my place.. I was like 'WHAT THE'.. he said that it was time to change.. I had to sit at the first row.. and guess where they put diana and zaty? ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD!! OMG!! I swore I freaked out!!.. It was soo far.. MANY people were not happy with their new seats.. haih.. teruk giler..   so masa agama.. we just hanged out together.. diana made me sing my song to zaty and melisa.. and I was like.. alar nanti lar.. then I went to do my hafazan.. then they asked me to sing again.. 'OK OK!' so I sang it to them.. melisa stopped me halfway and I was like.. 'lemme finish first!'.. turns out she couldn't hear me.. and we were laughing coz we should've let her say it.. hahahah..   so diana made me sing it again for melisa to hear it properly.. and I did.. it was tiring but fun.. they kept asking me to sing it louder and I was like..'but this is loud'.. so blar blar blar.. 'but you.. pretend that I'm invincible..'.. then agama class was over but diana made me sing it again to nadhirah.. OMG! seriously.. I thought that I could actually get muak to that song.. but I did sing it.. diana was singing the chorus part a little.. parts that she knows.. it was kida fun to her mouthing it out coz it felt like.. wow.. people know my song and they're singing it.. so it was kinda cool.. and then diana wanted me to sing again.. and I freaked out.. I said 'diana! I sang the song byk gila kali already.. and you've heard it like 4 times..' so I went back halfway round the world..   sejarah.. owh god! farah and sangeeta was joking around while the teacher is teaching and I cracked up gila gila! it was soo funny what they were doing.. then we just went back.. I said hi to shzlee on the way back and cair again at the sight of lai vi chian.. haih.. basically we just walked back home cam biasa..  the whole day was just.. biasa.. I tried writing another song.. but my brain wasn't working.. so i tried to study! so much for that! I called up shahir and asked him to help me with the guitar.. he played all the chords for me.. SUSAH NYER!! and we met up with ashraf and they volunteer to help me with my song.. so basically we just got hooked up on it.. I sang my song and the 2 of them just played to guitar to match up with the song..   then tonight we met again and we really concentrated on the song.. we made a rock version of the song and changed some of the lyrics.. its soo fun.. we were goofing around with the song.. but at the end.. we came up with a song.. I'm proud of it.. then we just hang out summore and we played our song 'diabetes' and the guys played 'last kiss' whilst I sing it.. then we had to go in.. so we did..  so basically.. I end up singing my song 6 times just today! whoa!  -I can actually get bored of MY song.. but so far.. I'm enjoying it.. its fun singing it..

      listening to : avril lavigne - fall to pieces mood : normal.. current status : kinda tired.. bored..   lemme give you a re-run on what happened today at school.. u know.. FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!  7.30am : still walking to school.. my tudung is all.. squshed.. my shoelaces are everywhere.. and my bag are pulling me backwards.. walked to school feeling very.. "I'm not ready!!" reached school and look out for everybody to hug! farah was the first victim.. then went to look for miza and shamee.. I even hugged ikha!? whoa! demented I am.. so then went over and give atikah this HUGE HUG!! hahahahah... should've looked at her face when I was squeezing her.. ahahahah.. hugged diana then..  seriously.. even I feel i am overly perky today.. overly PERKY it freaked myself out.. I'm starting to think it's getting kinda annoying for having an overly PERKY missy on FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL especially to people who don't like overly perky people.. miza?  8.00am : sitting in the perhimpunan place listening to speeches from upcoming elctors of the pengawas.. BOH-RING! so me and atikah got into this really long conversation bout and losing our sanity.. hahahah.. we blame it all on FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL! hahahah.. it was the funnest..  8.30am : still at the perhimpunan place.. getting more bored.. now we're talking about our soon-to-be band and figuring out names for it.. shoelace.. united states of whatever.. purple ducks!? ahahha.. and the moments when we laughed so hard till I thought my organs would come spitting out of my system.. it was funny.. we even talked about how gg will become the vocalist and call our band "gg and her band".. and we started singing the eminem song.. "the chicks don't even know the name of our band.. but they all want her like they wanna hold hands.." we talked about crap A LOT! FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!  8.45am : still here.. now we're just getting restless.. I think this is the longest conversation I ever had with anyone.. and it made it worst when the gal I get to have a one hours 30 minutes conversation with is atikah.. hahaha.. nah.. it was FUHN!  9.00am : finally got of to class.. sejarah was BORING!! puh-lease..I don't think one word masuk my head tadi.. the only think I heard him say was.. komunis.. 'like what the'.. though it is sejarah..  anytime after sejarah until rehat : we just hang out.. puan rosemary was out.. so we had 2 periods of pure.. NOISE MAKING OPPURTUNITY! joy!! me diana and zaty did a LOT of catching up.. it was fun.. hahaha.. really it was..  rehat : was normal! liek always.. I didn't eat my FRISE today though.. didn't feel like it.. then we went to see mr.jaacob to send cutie pie's homework.. man.. she cracks me up! mr. jaacob and atikah was all being FUNNY.. and there I was at the side laughing like my PERKY self in the WHOLE BILIK GURU! my gosh! but it was SOOOOO funny!  after rehat : sains teacher was.. a bad english person.. I mean.. "I do not want to teach you guys like a kids".. like what the! then we basically just ahng some more coz she didn't give us work.. until we get too.. overwhelmed so she gave us work.. haih.. agama class was fun.. tak belajar too.. ustazah did hafazan.. the clas was noisy but making fun of melisa was nothing BUT BORING! it was soo fun! coz she's like.. against the 3 of us.. it was soo funny.. it was fun.. and we made fun of her and shafiq. and shafiq teased me back.. blar blar blar.. well.. shahrul did throw this battery thingy at 'chinese boy' in agama class and he cried.. he looks soo red but who could tell. he's skin is soo pale.. so we just like.. 'haiyo! shahrul' he looked freaked out after that which was pretty funny.. hahaha..  going back time : so we just went back and I got my group hug with atikah and diana.. miza thinks my over perkyness was weird but who cares.. i love being perky.. I am perky miss perfect by the way..  at home : hung out with shahir for a few minutes.. had a serious chat with him about sumthing.. haih.. but it was fun making fun of himm.. HAR HAR HAR!! so thats it..  - FUN? OWH YEAH!!

      listening to : shahrul talking mood : DOH!! current status : mad that most of my friends aren't in!   OMG! It was the best thing ever! OMG! I freaked out at first coz its like my first ever time that I actually get on a drum set, playing an actual song, with actual people, with singing and bassguitar! it was soo scary at first! and I'm like.. tak kenal the 2 boys I play it with.. so I'm just like.. ' sitting there, on the drum set looking stupid, acting all next-door-girly type ' and the older brother 'boy' (owh please.. saying it makes me wanna puke!, said that he never played drums in his life and he played it so cun tadi! and he thought me all the things I need to know about the 'I Will Survive' song.. It was so cun..   ok, so the first 20 million times.. I sucked! but then.. the 2 boys and my teacher gave me some tips.. and made me feel comfortable around them.. and we acted like old buddies and stuff.. and I gather all my confidence.. and played them the song 'I Will Survive' and they said it was PERFECT! WOO-HOO!!   they said it was perfect.. boy told me when to do the rolling and stuff.. he said that I have to look at him playing bass to fit in with my drumming.. so the whole time I played my drums.. my eyes are fixed on his hands for the whole song.. its soo cool.. coz he played it like really cekap! and like.. kalau I salah, he would cover up a little for me.. its soo cun! he's so baik.. so we just played.. and I did the whole 'rolling' thing at the point when boy asked me too.. we played it like cun giler! and adlin sang it.. OMG! he's such a good voice! nice voice! I complimented him already! we just played the whole song tadi.. twice.. it got pretty boring when I had to play everything again and again coz drums main one beat jer.. but the thought of playing it and keeping it together..like.. 'this one goes like this, kena sama jer the speed, kena ikut jer.. kena roll at this time.. gotta keep my foot bass betul betul!' really confusing but its ok in the end! thank the lord!  - add a little butter and jam..

       I got into a conversation with my cousin a few days ago.. we were talking about guys as usual.. hahah.. she was telling me about her friends and her X-es and stuff.. I love to listen to this sorts of things.. u know.. the IMPORTANT things in life.. hahaha.. well.. we were chattering off until suddenly she asked me what are the things I want in a guy and what are the things I don't want in a guy.. I didn't answer that.. I didn't want to.. but now.. Its been bothering me.. It got me thinking.. I never actually given this a thought but now.. since I'm already into the subject.. why not think about it..   what i want in a guy - good personality! - great sense of humour - have sarcasm - can stand perkyness - good looking is a plus! - can play instruments is a plus too! - can stand being around me!   what I don't want in a guy - being embarrasses of me - insulting me - not standing up for me - being the rempit and wanna be cool guys - bad hair! - bad personality  thast it.. theres more but I gtg now.. add in later lar..  - call 1-800-i-think-i-am-your-dream-guy rite now!

It was boring coz.. GOD THERES NOTHING TO DO! I got restless I actually pergi tandas for the sake of walking.. I gave shahrul my Pokemon draw book.. (a book where I actually drew all these Pokemons in it.. back to the time when I was obsessed with them.. seriously, Pokemon best lar!) so anyway.. we got BORED BORED BORED!! we just pergi miza's and shameen's class...  It was fun there.. we just talked about a lot of stuff.. - cikgu awang (particularly shameen..) - my b'day party - slumber party and how they all are gonna pamper me! what am I? Molly the Manequin? - books (books?) - other stuffs..  Best lar! then kena balik kelas coz dah masa sains.. so me and diana went back and the whole class was going to the makmal.. so we just cepat-cepat pergi ambik our book.. the form 4 class is already there.. so mcm whateverla kan.. and then.. OMG! I saw on the board! IN BIG LETTERS! saying shahrul loves farisa! OMG! I quickly run to the borad.. padam my name.. and ran out of the class! ZATY!!!! HOW DARE YOU!!  we got there and we just buat our sains paper.. can you believe it.. we actually was doing kerja! and its not even compulsary for that day! I mean we don't have to hantar it today! so why bother buat now right? kan we can just put in aside like we always do.. WOW! maybe we are changing..

GOD!! we have 2 days guys! 2 DAYS TO BE FREE!!  so when we got back.. we jsut hung out with tan yang.. he's really cool! then we changed our time table.. I got really bengang! we took 4 months to get use to this one 'which happens to pernah kena tukar jugak dulu'.. and now they're chancing the times.. Puan Safinat for sains!!?? DAMN!!

(for anyone yang tak paham what I just said, it just basically means, I don't wanna be penyebok!)  we waited for G for 30 minutes or so.. she had to finish her exam.. we waited so she don't have to walk back alone.. such good friends she has.. she hugged me when we were parting! that was really sweet.. btw.. miza told me sumthing about 'matahari akan timbul di barat di bulan marikh pada bulan depan.. BULAN FREAKING DEPAN!OMG! I got scared coz earth is dekat ngan mars! and the tanda tanda kecil kiamat dah tunjuk! and al-quran pon dah hilang ayat!  TAKUT NYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't want to believe it.. but takut that I have to.. ARGH!!!!  so when I got back.. It got really boring.. I just played Harry Potter the whole day! nothing else to do.. whilst wondering what they all were doing at piramid and wished I could be there.. haih.. so instead of one day with SC.. instead I get to watch my brother POOPED!

I had a talk with fawwaz.. he asked me why I didn't come.. and I gave my reason.. and he got apologetic.. he said he didn't know I wasn't invited.. he thought miza had ajaked me bacause shahrul was going and stuff.. but its no problem! much!! hahaha.. no problem lar miza..  then I talked to shahrul tonight and he said he didn't have a very good time without me there..  OMG!! sweet nyer!  miza, G, fawwaz and fanid sure had a good time.. I didn't care sgt pon.. what to do.. I don't think my mom agrees pon kalau I asked her to go.. so.. abaikan!!

      again.. we had to sit for another 2 hours of 'all-time-with-rosemary'.. I'm telling you.. spending you're saturday, in school, tengah hari, panas, rosemary, 2 hours.. is actually kinda fun! haha! It was pretty ok the last time (only that then was 4 hours).. so we got there.. don't know why I was so keen for melisa to come! but she got here eventually.. then off we went to the class.. as usual.. we have the 'sitting' problem! I HATE THAT! why can't they have chairs and tables in 3-s..   its evil I tell you.. so masa tgh.. am I to sit here or here.. I got malas (coz I don't want it to spoil my mood).. so I keluar class and asked them to pick sendiri.. when I got back, zaty was sitting next to diana.. typical.. so I sat there alone.. then got my mood down.. so the whole time everybody is taking their places.. the chair next to mine remains empty.. like it has always been.. (is this a sign of sumthing??)  so for the whole time I was just masam jer.. I didn't want to talk.. I was sad! tgk semua org ada all their little friendsies next to them.. how I wished atikah's (and mine) sarcasm was with me then.. give mercy! it was soo boring..  and then the most shocking thing happen! plus embarrassing! shahrul and omar came late to class.. like 30 minutes late or sumthing! AND THERE WAS NO OTHER PLACE LEFT TO SIT! to make matters worth! everybody (particularly melisa and farah, diana and zaty) kept asking the teacher to put him next to me.. at the empty chair NEXT TO ME! OMG! he hesitated.. I neglected! it was such an embarrassing moment! and when he sat down next to me! EVERYBODY CHEERED OUT REALLY LOUD! (since we played truth-or-dare, a few number of poeple know about my crush) so tehy cheered loud! LAMA! I was BLOOD RED! nad shaking.. I felt like exploding! we were both embarrassed and can do NOTHING about it! ARGH!!  then the tecaher asked omar to sit one table with him.. making him shift more closer to me! OWH MY GOD!! I'm just like.. 'o..k.. omar.. ur not fat.. right?' omar kept nidging him to go further inside.. I was just sitting there.. feeling like the main attraction of a show in the zoo! everybody laughed and cheered for me! one more time and I swear I'll go KA-BOOM!  nawal said that omar was only 'kacau daun'.. what! no way! so it just got really awkward at first! I was staring at my book, pretending to read.. but my mind is still frozen after the shock! need gumballs!  after a while or so.. we got ok.. we started to talk.. not like.. 'so hows ur day' talk.. more of a 'have a read pen?' talk.. but its ok I guess.. after we finished.. he wished me luck for my jamming and like.. ARGH! naik giler! I was happy when I got home.. (not becuase of the fact that he sat next to me ok guys.. the fact that he said things to me)  ok so thats it! it was a happy day for me! honest! more over after the jamming! IT ROCKS!  - 'cikgu.. letak dia kat situ cikgu!','cikgu kat situ kosong!','cikgu, dia nak duduk situ cikgu','cikgu, tu makwa dia cikgu!' PUH-LEASE!!

      It was brutal.. ok ok! so maybe this is what I get for doing it to my friends but it came as a shock! I didn't even see it coming! it was like.. a flash of thunder and tiba-tiba..I'm wet all over! OMG! I mean.. wheres the rain you guys! They've been trying to get me for months now and ok ok! safe to say! YOU GOT ME GUYS! congratulations! owh well.. then when I thought it was over.. hamiza came to me a splashed her half full bottle to my face.. OMG! I was soaking wet when I got home! It was really weird walking back like that.. it was a pretty big 'camotion' there and then.. me being me.. I shrieked really loud! twice.. and it was really embarrassing and SC was there.. OMG! malu giler! ok ok! it was fun lar! BUT NO MORE!  - takda angin, takda hujan, tapi badan basah!

      listening to : avril - my happy ending mood : normal current status : not overly perky.. but not angsty  so I did it.. bgn awal today! at about 7.. u won't believe how ngantuk I was.. OMG! but teringat melisa and the other gals so terus bgn.. ahahahaha.. so then.. I got ready.. it was already pukul 8.10 when I reached school.. hahaha.. the girls were all 'LAMBAT! mcm nenek!' (hey!! nadhirah pon belom sampai kay!)  got there..  OMG ! lapar! again the whole.. (tak mkn dinner, ok wait.. I had leftover pizzas..) but still.. when we settled everything there.. we were just talking.. papers and books and pens are ready.. but I guess we're just not.. hahaha.. then nadhirah came! yay! me and zaty (who didn't have breakfast yet) got really hangry and ajak the whole group pergi mkn.. mkn kat RAVI! I love the roti canai.. SEDAP! dah lar panas.. (kinda makes me wanna eat one now..  SHUT UP FARISA! )  we just talked masa tgh mkn.. we just talked (what do you expect? we're 5 teenage girls at a kedai makan.. what do you expect us to do besides talk and gossip.. its a girls' thing what!)after that we went to 7-11.. and I got my lollipop.. yum.. I need sumthing while working kan?  when we got back to school.. the kantin ladies persons tak bagi bukak kipas.. so rude! bukannya nak buat apa apa kat kipas diorang.. so we had to join in puan rosemary's geo class.. she was nice and we were noisy.. hahaha.. we just settled at the back of the class and did our work..  we got bored halfway and decided to kacau people.. (we do our work kay!) but the problem is.. who!? (well, on account melisa was there.. and kalau nak kacau shahrul nanti mak dia marah..) we decided to kacau shafiq.. we got his no. anyways.. just that its WRONG! org cina yg jawab! hahaha!  SHAHRUL!!!!   so we had to call shahrul to confirm the right no. he gave me a new no. but it was only 9 digits.. HAHAHAH! tahpapakan.. so kena call AGAIN! I made diana call coz I just talked to mom and didn't want the mom to thin I'm mcm.. mengacau her anak.. (although technically thats what we're doing.. but there were reasons kay!)when the mom answered diana chickened out and put off the phone! hahah! its soo funny.. nak takut apa? then zaty called.. then we asked for his real no... 10 digits one.. and we got it..  nawal called shafiq (we're all excited particularly melisa).. but tak dpt.. we thought he belom bgn.. (you know, guys kan have this thing with bangun lambat and stuff) so we just biar jer.. then shahrul called me to say the no. he gave was wrong (haih..) and we got the  REAL  no.. and this time.. its real.. we called (using nawal's phone) and it worked..  he answered the phone and evryone got all.. 'jumpy'.. hahah.. all the girls was rebuting the phone.. (cept me and diana, who was just laughing at the others.. like ayam-ayam rebut untuk mkn.. only that theres only one makanan.. [which in this case is the phone]).. then the whole lot of them were like.. 'melisa nak ckp ngan awak' and melisa were just moving away but was interested.. how do I explain.. like.. she didn't want to ckp but was soo keen to get the phone..  I just stomped of to them and grabbed the phone and talked to shafiq.. he was nice.. melisa wanted to hear his voice.. so I had to act stupid and made me ask him to say 'I am shafiq' just for the sake of her dengar-ing his voice.. hahaha.. I just ckp sekejap jer.. then I got back to my work..  ok ok! so it still not finished yet! but we did byk jugak! and then it was almost 12 so kena pergi already.. melisa and nawal: taek-won-do [god I miss taek-won-do], zaty: tuisyen, me: have to practice guitar and drums for class and diana and nadhirah just didn't want to stay 2 org jer..  me and diana went to block flora and sat in the middle of the pdg.. serious.. the kerusi-s that were there as the goalpost was used.. we just sat there and talked.. (again the whole girl thing) it was weird to be in the middle there 2 org.. hahahah.. then we just went back..  Balik terus practice the instruments coz takda masa and stuff.. and at 1 we went to parade.. I was hungry and had nasi goreng and sotong goreng.. yum.. then i WENT for class.. drum clas was fun (like always).. me and my teacher always joked around about me being the superstar drummer that is very busy putting on shows and stuff.. its fun lar.. (I'm telling you.. I have been getting less comment on my playing.. I might actually be getting good at this drumming thing)..  then I join boy and adlin for jamming.. the boys wanted to play  'the reason' .. the teacher didn't know that song so the 3 of us just played the whole song for him to recognise it.. best! the drumming is like damn easy.. simple beat! damn easy! I think I did good.. well.. next week we're playing the song with bass and guiar and drums and singing.. the real deal. I ajaked farah to see me play since she  LOVES  that song.. so next week farah will be in the studio..  then balik.. I just baked cookies, baca All-American Girl (again..) and main computer.. heheh.. I tidur masa maghrib.. can u believe that!? god. nasib baik my cous kejut me or else melepas chance masuk net.. she waked me and gave me birthday present.. hahahha... its this teddy thingy with a thingy at the front where you can put thingies in it.. hahaha.. I'm not explaining well am i? nvr mind..  the whole night I was just finding ways to not fall asleep so I can masuk net.. I had to force myself to baca buku to keep me awake.. i stole a 15 minutes nap before I masuk.. nasib baik I was able to bgn..  internet is fun! as always.. so basically thats it.. thats my day.. is it weird that I talk about my day in every blog? coz miz and atikah uses one blog to certa about what happened in a few days.. owh well.. thats just me I guess.. and aren't u guys penat baca panjang-panjang? again thats just me..  - me mE ME!!!

      listening to : myself singing Breathe - Michelle Branch mood : read the title current status : in fantasy land  I am  SOOOOO DAMN  happy right now!   not to 'dissed' anyone who is feeling angsty.. which was how I felt a few days back.. I know I know.. Now that I read my last blog. It felt stupid.. But the pain remains.. I still remember clearly what happened.. thanks to this (lovely pink blog which I just happen to LOVE so much), I will remember this incident in a few years to come.. Don't worry.. I plan to..  Anyways, I've been talking to my maid now.. Pretend like nothing happened.. cannot fight for more than 3 days right? so what-the-hu!  how was my day? (I'm beginning to love these few meaningless words)  bgn.. hmm.. at 5am.. to buat nota sejarah (I know I know.. I won't do it next time.. which is exactly what I said the last time.. hehe) anyhue.. I was ready to bury myself in books and fill in those blank pages in my sejarah note book.. HOO-RA!  the next thing I know..  ITS 6 O'CLOCK!  I slept through the whole one hour! One whole precious hour where instead.. I could've been reading and writing about Lord Whats-His-Name.. owh well.. so I just continued.. avril by my side.. singing her wonderful songs.. ('I don't want to fall to pieces.. I just want to sit and stare at you..') Lucky my lovey-dovey sister has her nota lying around somewhere.. I just copied it down.. ( DON'T TELL CIKGU JAAFAR! )  guess what! tak habis! heheh! typical! It was already 7.05! and belum mandi! hahahah! So I just rushed through everything.. when will I ever learn? (tomorrow? hahaha).. so when I got there.. I just cpt-cpt coz we had to go to surau for agama.. met Diana on the way so just waited for her.. met shahrul halfway to the surau.. he baru dtg.. ngan fawwaz.. I said Hi! to both of them.. ( gosh I'm perky! ).. I don't remember their reactions so moving on...  Agama paper.. 71! yay! If I hadn't changed the asnwer to that one  lowsy  question! I would've gotten an A! You see.. thats the problem with me.. luck is just not on my side.. neither are A's.. whatever pon lar.. I just hate my bad luck-ness.. I mean.. whats the one thing that I'm lucky at? just name me one thing! anybody?  Diana and Zaty got and A.. yay. so whateverla kan.. who cares.. I'm not A student material.. what do i care if both my friends get an A and me stuck with the same typical BIG BOLD B! what do I care.. (which is why I really should consider  ASRAMA! )  I just sat there finishing my copying on how Singapura was seperated from Malaysia (why do I care about this again? owh yeah.. coz its "sejarah"..  wow-wee.. ) just sitting there.. all alone.. ok ok.. all alone with Tunku Abdul Rahman.. while everyone else is.. happy! its killing me!  Science. Just moody.. malas nak buat apa apa.. and happens to kena buat eksperimen. didn't even know what its about.. Just sitting there.. connecting the black ones.. to the red thingies.. was there a white? (hahhaha) the gals ajak me pick books then.. i malas gila but just pergi like what the heck.. Got to pick a book titled 'Alison's Revenge' wooo... sounds scary! Its about this Alison girl who wants to find the person who killed her twin sister.. but finds out shocking truth about her family.. pretty impressive huh how I can know all this.. well.. its a little sumthing call.. sypnosis..  Math..  DULL!  Farah dah kena duduk jauh depan! NO!!! gonna miss that little lady! so far away.. Nadhirah gets to sit at her place.. more joy life brings! Thank god Jessica is still next to me.. If Jessica is seperated I swear they were ready to put shahrul next to me! (chills..)  Rehat.. (hey boys and girls.. can you say..)  LAPAR!!  I didn't have dinner (slept at 8 for gods sakes.. why? I have no idea! and still I've wasted one hour by sleeping at 5am tadi..) so I had LAKSA!  SEDAP..!!  any spilled on my tudung? hahaha.. take a guess..  Sejarah.. GOD! could it be more  BORING!  but the whole time me and farah were throwing kisses at each other.. hahha.. the teacher was shush-ing us.. we were just laughing.. zahra said shahrul was looking at us the whole time.. FUH-NY!  Balik? Got to caught up on who to teman me to beli baking stuff for my cookies.. Thank god Diana was there.. I just love the baking kedai! Its not much.. I mean, its just a baking store.. But the feeling that I get when I masuk is just.. splendid.. I dunno.. bukannya apa-apa.. then we had a round of ice cream.. we taked about lotsa stuff.. interesting stuff.. (raise eyebrows a few times while smiling, just try doing it and you'll know what I mean)  Then find out I had no more brown sugar and eggs.. ajak shameen pergi 14 beli those stuff.. hahaha.. I was walking the whole day..  PENAT ! but it all paid of when I got to make 2 batches of  CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES  dough! alright! I'm just ratah-ing the thing! SEDAP LAR! then tuisyen..  Tuisyen? FUHN! ok ok! theres better times.. but now I know that the kilat goes for the highest object it can find.. its interesting actually..  balik? rebut Tv for Malaysian Idol.. best lar.. I don't really like to hear the singing.. I'm more interested in how the Malaysians can compete with the org puteh version.. serious.. how lame they can get and how much they are so MENIRU-ING the  mat-saleh..  eheheh..  online.. shahrul can't chat so he called me instead.. stupid phone kena habis battery! our conversation was cut short! haih.. well.. at least he's calling me again nanti.. so no worries.. but It was fun! he's so damn nice..  then now I'm online.. gtg now.. shahrul is out.. and I gotta sleep.. besok nak kena be at school by 8am.. imagine that.. early morning at shcool on a saturday.. wat'd I tell you.. my life is FUN! owh well.. gtg now.. Alison is waiting..  - is it possible to be feeling so bad.. to feeling so good.. in a few days jer..

      mood : BAD! current status : lower than shit!     I made the biggest mistake of my life! I lied to my friends. It was stupid. I didn’t know why I did that. Well, actually, maybe I do. I came back from school yesterday feeling really depressed. Fact that I just got a very bad result for my Geography. What will mom say. Supposingly my internet will be cut off. And I just can’t live with that. I can’t live without internet. That’s basically the only time I can really talk and open up to shahrul. Take that away, might as well take everything else too. So I felt angsty of course. ‘The world is a big dark hole, I’d just better die because me living is only bringing bad things (or in this case, bad results)'. I got back and I got really hungry (eating is my cure for depression, I know I know that’s bad).     So usually, everytime I get back from school, I’ll have my lunch before I jaga my adik for my maid to have her lunch. But yesterday, who-knows-why my maid sent my brother upstairs for me to jaga whilst I eat, when she kat bawah, pergi mandi! MANDI! I mean, wait for me to eat before you mandi lar! U know, LIKE ALWAYS!! And whenever I makan, I would like some peace and quiet and nobody kacau-ing me. And there she goes, let my brother crying for me. I got pissed la kan. Especially that day when my angsty-ness rate is VERY HIGH! ARGH! I was just ready to burst.    Which is exactly what I did. I went to the toilet to wash my hands and when I got out, I saw my brother sat on my lunch! SAT ON MY LUNCH! The food was scattered, the plate is broken, he’s ass is covered in tom yam soup, and my other brother is WATCHING TV! Imran just cried and cried. I got so bengang I stomped to my mother’s bed, buried my face in the bantal, AND SCREAMED MY HEAD OFF!! My throat got kering and my back was hurting! I couldn’t stand it. I was crying so bad when I washed of my brother. I couldn’t take it anymore! And then I got an idea. I couldn’t stay there anymore. I wouldn’t.    So I just grab my brother and just left him in front of the bathroom’s door, where my maid is. I shouted at her! I grabbed the kain buruk and just cleaned up the mess. The whole time CURSING my maid. Saying things I’ve never and can’t believe that I ever did. I couldn’t stand it! I was losing my mind! I just exploded! I just dump everthing in a tray, left it in the sink, and went up to pack my bags.    I didn’t care about anything except to get out of the house. (must be how Harry felt when he stomped of the Dursleys. And I’m telling you, it ain’t pretty). Luckily, Im invited to shahir’s house for the day to play guitar. So that’s where I went. I only thought about bringing my towels, telekung, baju, and my tuisyen bag. And I stomped of to shahir’s house. My maid saw me leave. That’s what I want. I want her to be scared. I want her to worry about what will mom do to her when she finds out I’m missing. She looked worried. I didn’t care. I banged the door and head to shahir’s house. When I told him I’ll be staying at his house for one whole day (including the mandi-ing and sembahyang-ing) he freaked out. He thought I was kidding. Well when I’m really mad like that! It ain’t a joke!    So I just spent the day with shahir and shafiq. We just watched tv the whole day and played sims. Going to shell to buy my lunch. And guess what it was? A mangy Twiesties Tomatoe. Yup. I was so hungry. So I felt better then. The two boys cheered me up a little. So when I went to tuisyen, I just acted normal. Only shameen knows what really happened. When I got back, my mom asked me what happened and made me explain everything. So I did. She sympathized me. Instead of ‘NO MORE NOTHING!’, she just said, ‘are you hungry?’ she is truly the best. She went out for dinner last night. I wasn’t up for going so I stayed home and made caramel pop corns. She just brought back a cheeseburger for me, cause I said I already ate the pop corns.                                                              * * * * *     I woke up today feeling like shit. Yeap. Shit that just got smashed by a big lorry’s tire. I woke up kind of late, and had to rush through everything. I felt so bad tadi. When I got to school, I tried to act normal. Well, I guess it didn’t work. Diana realized. I pretend like nothing happened. Only agama class cheered me up again. I was happy. The smile this time wasn’t plastered. It was real. But when I got back from agama class, it felt like shit again. (I really do need to sit near my friends again.)    When its time to go home, I just felt really down. I told Diana I ran away from home. I meant to tell her that I got back already, but played along to it for a while. She told Atikah and Gg (who told fawwaz then.) about it. And they got really worried. I just went through with it. And the cry, it was real. I couldn’t act that good sampai menangis so the cry must be real. I guess it just let go of some of the pain. And I felt nice being wrapped around my friends’ arms and their concerns. I think that’s what made me do it. I want attention. I felt lonely. Like the whole world is against me. Grades are bad, had a big fight sampai lari rumah (one of the things I never wanted to do.), I know I shouldn’t take it on my friends but being around them just made me feel secure, and loved.    Shahrul didn’t even asked me what was wrong, and I know he knows there was something wrong. And it made me feel worse that way. And when I told them I was kidding, the whole of them just got really mad at me. And I just snapped to realty, realizing what I just did! I felt really guilty, I was walking home, thinking of cutting myself ( this one thing I know I  WON’T ever do, and lucky I didn’t ) I just balik and cried. And this time I didn’t feel like shit, I felt lower the shit. The one thing I need most at a time like this, is my friends, and I lied to them. I didn’t know what to do. I apologized and they said they weren’t mad. I didn’t believe them. They have to marah. I want them to. I just lied to them, made them stay back and stuff, and for what, for attention? GOD!    I hate myself right now. I couldn’t forgive myself for doing that. I just want to write to express how I feel. To have someone to talk to. To tell, but don’t need to hear anything from them, just for them to listen. I want my sister right now. Its not like I tell her all my problems, hopes and dreams, but having a sister by my side, is what I need right now. (since I screwed up with my friends.)                                                                      -n-  there won't be anymore Perky Miss Perfect. She's dead. and this will be the last time I write like this. I will be different. A new person. Out with the old and in with the new. The new Farisa will be more serious. A whole lot more serious.  - I'm gonna miss me..

SE-VEN-TY FO-UR! haih.. pleading need to be done.. navin.. will play my partner in crime.. since he too... got a  SE-VEN-TY FO-UR! .. shafiq can join too I suppose.. 2 marks is ok too give free right?  I just wasn't feeling good after that.. I wasn't depress because I got a 74.. I was just depress because izzati was depress and didn't wanna talk to me.. I mean seriously.. what am I? a rotting tree who's just gonna sit there till she says sumthing.. NO WAY!  she didn't wanna talk to me so WHATEVER la kan.. I just went to teh front when Diana joined me.. argh! We just talked about.. stuff.. asrama and stuff... you know. those normal talks.. I still wasn't feeling to well.. so I went over to atikah's.. grab her from her class.. and write SALLY LOVES SHIICK on my clas board.. ahahha.. (ok diana did but same all same all)it was kinda fun lar.. atikah is the best angsty cure.. serious..  then when she got back.. I just got depressed again.. and farah HAD TO beli keropok and offered me.. you know me and my whole 'EAT when I'm depressed' problem.. haih.. geramnya!  got back.. biasa lar.. I masuk net for an hour.. it was all ok and stuff.. sahhrul tertinggal his bag in the class thats now locked so tak tau nak buat apa.. I invited him to come take his bag now.. masa ptg.. but he couldn't make it..  then I just got BORED! nothing to do! too bored.. need help.. need harry potter.. need cookies.. (and lucky I have them!)  so i just started on my jadual PMR!  I got so into it.. that OMG!.. it looked so official and ready to be.. followed.. and I can't wait to actually ikut the jadual.. I also did a whole calender counting the days till PMR! (I had lots of time)  so now.. on my room wall.. I have a whole 'PMR CORNER' hahah! weird huh?  Farisa's PMR CORNER : consists of - the PMR jadual - the Farisa's studying for PMR jadual - the Farisa's counting the days till the PMR calender - and a cute little pouch made out of paper.. to put pencils in it.. (seriously.. i don't knwo why its there.. but it makes it more.. official and makes me look more.. into it! ahahha)  after that.. I made dinner!

      wow! I came back really happy today! Shahrul gave me a birthday present before I went back from school.. I was just so eager to get back home to see what it is.. I was just hiding the nicely wrapped box-thingy so my friends won't have to boycott me into opening it there and then..  when I got home.. my maid was like.. 'asal happy sgt?' but who cares.. I was just smiling till I get to my room.. I bukak tudung and dumped everything on my bed and sat on my sister's bed to open the gift!  my heart was beating.. it was really exciting.. when I opened the wrapper (carefully).. theres was a blue box.. on it sayd 'Just For You".. wow.. I was all touched and stuff..  HAHA!   and I haven't even see the present yet..  and when I opened the box.. I nice blue colour watch rested in it.. I was all melting and stuff.. it was the sweetest thing.. and its pretty too.. serious.. I'm not just saying it coz shahrul was the one who gave it to me.. but really its nice.. I'm in love with the strap! and the bulat thingy has very cute shapes made out to form numbers 1 to 12.. (just come to me if you wanna see it coz it hard to explain)  I was like.. gila cair lar.. put it on right away.. and went to show my maid.. (I guess I just really need to show it to sumone and all my friends are like.. not there.. so maid pon.. maid lar..)  I called shahrul afterwards to thank him again! and then we masuk net sekejap.. but it was kilat-ing and stuff.. so we had to get off.. but shahrul called me and we talked for about half an hour but then I had to go bake cookies for my cpusin's party.. MENGACAU JER! but it was fun while it lasts.. wow!  after hujan.. I masuk net jap.. we were just talking..  it was one of the funnest day for me jugak lar.. very touchy and cair-y.. its just wonderful..  - thanks shahrul!

      10.  I don’t have to go on tour. I can stay home with my internet. Plus see       shahrul at school all the time.. well, that is if both of us actually come to       school.. and theres the whole, PJ and KH thing..  9.   Between school, tuisyen and music lessons, and my social life, I really don’t have        time to put that much thought into my wardrobe. Dressing whimsically is actually a       lot of responsibilty.  8.   Gwen has stuff written about her in the tabloids and stuff. Some are not even true.       I don't think I want the whole world to know where I live, whats my number or even      what I had for dinner. Nor am I ready for the whole world to judge me base on my      music (which is not very appealing) and my style (which is also not appealing)   7.   Gwen don’t have time, or don’t even stay in one place that long to be able to go on        a date or catch a movie with friends (or boyfriends).  6.   Gwen wears a lot of navel bearing outfits. My navel isn’t exactly my best feature.       Fortunately, my mom told me if she ever catch me wearing navel bearing outfit, she       would never let me go to anymore dates or jamming as long as I live. Besides I have       the whole ‘tudung’ thing.  5.   According to my sister, who reads a lot of girl beauty magazines, if I dyed my       hair as often as Gwen has, it would all fall out.  4.   Gwen has to hang out all day, everyday with the rowdy boys in her band. The only        boys I ever have to hang out with are shahrul, my friends, my brother’s       friends and my friend’s boyfriends, and none of them, so far has expressed any       interest in playing the drums wearing nothing at all, which, if you ask me, would       be totally embarrassing.  3.   Gwen may not be aware of this little known fact but geeks make the best       boyfriends.It sounds surprising, but it is true. You know those little smiles of       Shahrul’s, the little secret ones he always seemed to have on his face? Those       smiles, he says, are on account of me. Because, he told me, he never thought he’d       meet a girl like me.  2.   Gwen’s sister, though she’s probably nice and all, can’t possibly be as cool as       mine, who, even though she can be a real pain sometimes, is actually pretty       righteous the rest of the time. I mean, she totally forgive me for the whole me       playing guitar (when its something she really wants to do) and the time she helped       me looking really pretty on the Setia night (at least I think I did). Does that       tell you something?  And the number-one reason I’m glad I’m not Gwen Stefani:  1. Because then I wouldn’t be me.

      First Born (aka ayong) : Bossy. Always gets what she wants. Kids most likely to end up discovering the cure for cancer, hosting her own talk show, stepping up to the alien mothership when it lands and being all “Hey, welcome to Earth” etc.  Last Born (aka Imran/Ajin) : Baby. Always gets what they want. Kids most likely to be CEO of a major corporation, dictator of a small country, supermodel, you name it.  Middle child (aka me) : Lost in the shuffle. Never gets what she wants. Kids most likely to end up a teen runaway, living on leftover Big Macs scrounged from Dumpsters behind the local Mc Donald’s for weeks before anyone even notices she is gone.  -Its true. I read this somewhere.

      listening to : hoobastank - the reason  mood : ok lar..  current status : letih..    ok.. I'm suppose to update this blog like last time I masuk.. and the other few times I masuk too.. but I got too malas to tulis.. so basically, I'm just gonna conclude what heppened the whole week kay.. here we go.. and yes guys... its gonna be LONG!    monday - nothing much.. until that night.. when I was kononnya study dlm my room.. like I've said countless times.. I CANNOT STUDY MALAM2! STOP FORCING ME! haih.. so apa lagi.. mestilar tertidur right. wadda you expect!? then, about 9 o'clock.. I terjaga.. thinking I HAVE to get back to my sejarah.. (  perang tiga segi antara johor, acheh dan pihak portugis di melaka ) I got up to go wash up.. (hahahah.. that sentence sounds pretty weird)..    when I got back to my room.. the pretty guitar was lying there.. just calling my name.. and I'm like addicted to the song 'Kau Ilhamku' (influenced by 'you-know-who').. so I picked up my guitar and played the song.. until I got a call.. its usually shahrul who calls my phone.. but its not.. its Omar! I was kinda shocked lar.. like.. you never ever ever EVER called me before.. so I just answered lar kan..    I heard fawwaz's voice.. he sounded so freaked out.. and so.. worried.. he made ME freaked out.. he asked me what I was doing.. I'm like.. apa benda nih? tibe-tiba jer nak tahu what I was doing.. kinda weird.. I thought he nak ajak keluar ngan the others or sumthing.. then.. the unexpected happened.. he told me that iesqo's dad has passed away.. I was menggelabah gila.. I don't know why! I was in total shock! GELABAH GILA!    he asked me to meet him kat gate sekolah.. NOW! so i got ready! I was shaking.. I called everyone I could.. MIZA! NO MORE GAYUTING MLM-MLM KAY! when I got to the gate.. I saw omar getting into shahrul's car and driving to iesqo's house.. I got out of the car and go talk to fawwaz.. I felt weird to talk to him since mom was there to 'see'.. haih.. then i was just waiting in the car for diana.. thats when mom drove me and diana to the house..    we got there.. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE! I saw shahrul and stuff (but whateverlarkan).. we just waited depan the pintu.. calling practically a lot of poeple! we jsut waited for the body and stuff.. just sitting there with diana.. talking.. iesqo looked sad... but I couldn't tell really coz he was busy running around doing stuff.. when Atikah knew.. I asked her to come and stuff.. and me and diana waited for her at the corner street.. we met sahhrul, shzalee and fawwaz there.. fawwaz left and asked the 2 boys to teman us.. (to protect from the bad guys and the night bugs I suppose..)    we were just waiting there.. talking.. me and diana I mean.. me and shahrul didn't talk.. much.. what do you expect.. shazlee was there.. it seems weird (but after that, shazlee asked me why I was not talking to his brother that night.. hahah.. I felt weird for nothing..) just waiting there for 30 minutes for atikah.. gila kan!    then we went back and the jenazah was there.. we just baca yasin and stuff.. after that.. me and practically all my girl friends just hung out outside.. everyone was there at least.. so thats the best part of the whole thing.. we just stayed untuil 12.00 when dah kena balik... school teh next day and stuff..    I got back.. and was basically sweating.. so I mandi.. and still trying to recover from the shock.. haih.. then it was pretty hard to sleep.. really.. but eventually I did..    the next day...    I have to go now.. my mom dah suruh offline.. I'll update more on the rest of the days later.. and tuesday was the best day.. so tunggu je lar.. ahahah..    - to think.. this long is only Monday.. hahahha! and I've got a lot to tell on tuesday.. sorta!

         We were all walking to Subang Parade when we saw Fawwaz pushing Shahrul who was in a trolley.. OMG!! They looked so silly.. and we were all just laughing.. hahha…               Soon.. all the other guys joined them.. I mean seriously.. My brothers don’t do that.. and they’re 11 years old and 1 year old.. I guess it’s a guy thing kot.. then all the girls and Fandi went to MPH first.. whilst the rest playing trolley outside..               Me and Gg were wlaking together to MPH! When we reached there.. I went back to call the guys.. They should really stop it and go jalan-jalan with us all.. or sumthing..               When I met them.. Fawwaz pushed Shahrul next to me and we just walked together..               Since none of the others wanted to go to the computer games store (they rather spend time with books than Harry Potter and The Sims and the rest of the FUN computer games..) so I ajaked Shahrul.. hehhe.. at least ada kawan..               We just hanged out together.. We went to computer games shop.. Then Toys ‘R’ Us.. Then Yamaha..               We went to the studio room where I jam.. I brought in a guitar and borrowed my drums teacher a pair of drums-sticks.. Shahrul asked me to play my song but I chickened out and stopped at the middle of a song I played.. malular.. then I let Shahrul played on the drums for a while.. then I played the drums.. The Reason is the only drums song I can play (and I Will Survive but dah lupa dah!).. so I played that.. played only parts of the song lar.. just playing and singing the chorus (coz that’s the only part I hafal).. and he was just watching me.. Felt kinda weird really.. Main drums with no guitar and stuff.. But then we went out..               We went to MPH! Mom called! Yikes! But nasib baik can stay till 6.30pm.. phew.. Shahrul was suppose to go back at 6 but he just stayed jer.. When we got there.. we just saw people and stuff.. It got bored again.. then Shahrul ajaked me to find headsets.. we found some.. ahahha…               Masa nak pergiu balik to MPH we saw Iman, Isko and Nasriff playing trolleys.. HAHAHAH!!! They were gonna make a movie! OMG! I mean seriously?               When we got to MPH we saw miza-fandi and gg-fawwaz sumwhere.. we just joined them.. but it was almost 6.30pm so we all had to go already.. all 3 pairs of us just parted.. ahhaha.. then I went to say bye to miza.. shahrul to fandi.. then before I left.. Shahrul asked me to be his girlfriend.. hahaha.. I turned jelly.. but said yes after that..               Then we just said bye to each other.. Shameen joined me and we went to meet my dad..               Masa balik.. I was really happy.. I was jumpy and OVERLY-OVERLY perky! Hahahah! But thank god I covered in front of mom.. phew..               When I got back home.. amsa tgh tgk the O.C. I got worried.. I mean.. I was still smiling.. But I got scared.. about what?               I was scared that I would not remember this day.. Its such a FUN FUN FUN day.. but luckily sampai sekarang ingat lagi.. but sekarang is only 2 days after that but still.. haih..               But it was one of the happiest day of my life.. thanks you guys for inviting me and stuff..               - I hope I can remember!

      listening to : Avril Lavigne - Slipped Away  mood : oklar..  current status : blur!       Mom only confirmed I can go this morning and that is on one condition.. I can never go out until after PMR again!               TORCHER!               I was having second thoughts about the whole thing because if I agree.. I cannot go out again for another 2 months! No going out anymore means no Cinderella Story!               ARGH!!!               Maybe I can see it at the movies with my sissy, but she’s all against Hilary Duff and stuff so I’m not really sure.. haih.. what am I to do?               All morning I’m just still thinking wether I should go or not.. Its only till 10am that Shahrul confirmed he could go.. Then I thought.. what the heck.. might as well go and enjoy it if it’s the last time I could go out.               Its about 1.00pm when mom asked me to eat lunch.. Lunch? Mom! I’m going out at 3 to go to Swenson.. Waddaya mean Lunch? Of course I didn’t say that.. I don’t want to get on her bad side since it could ruin my chances of going..                So I ate lunch with my dad, bro and my 4 year old cousin.. his mom and my mom are goind out to watch a play at 3.00pm about 4 women going to menopause. WHAT!?               I was rushing when I got ready because I had to be at Miza’s house in 10 minutes and I haven’t mandi and sembahyang yet! ARGH!!!! I did verything cpt-cpt.. and was late of course but miza didn’t marah me or anything..               What was I wearing? Hmm.. Orange (my signature colour ) top.. short-sleeved and has two cicak-rangka(s) on it.. its really nice.. I love that shirt.. and was wearing my plain blue jeans.. I looked normal only.. I was wearing the jam Shahrul gave me.. and my sis’s shoes since mine dah rosak! WAH!!! Dah lar I love that pair of shoes..                And miza looked really nice.. a little (ok a lot!) to the gothic side but pretty none-the-less.. she had on a plain black top.. ¾ sleeve.. had on a black denim skirt.. black bag.. and sneakers.. she also had on a butterfly tattoo on her left hand.. she thinks she looked fat and ugly.. OF COURSE NOT MIZA!               When we got to parade, we went straight to MPH! Joy! Hahhah! We looked at books and stuff for about 15 minutes.. after I finished with the magazines and Harry Potter corner.. I got bored.. Miza was at the teenager-corner browse-ing through books.. Boring nyer! I was pulling her out of the bookstore ASAP! She ajaked pergi cari The Resmus CD!               We went to Penny Lane but no luck.. Then we went to Speedy.. Finish stock! Haih.. We met Azman there though.. he was with his family or sumthing.. me being my Perky ‘saying-hi-to-everyone-I-know-and-meet’ self.. I said hi to him in my utmost perky voice.. he just smiled.. I’m starting to think ‘HI!’ is not in his vocabulary!               Then Atikah joined us there.. I was surprised! Why!? Coz she was wearing skirt! Don’t get me wrong coz Atikah looked great! But skirt!? Atikah and skirt!? OK OK! Its not very big really but its not really the atikah I know.. whatever right!               Atikah was wearing a denim long sleeved blouse and a long ‘Summerset Bay’ type of skirt.. its pretty skirt really..               We were ready to go walking around in Parade (us 3 musketeers!) but we met Fandi sumwhere in the middle of Subang Parade.. so we excused miza to go jalan-jalan with him and me and Atikah went to Yamaha! Hehehe!               Atikah wanted me to play my song.. And I did.. but not the whole song.. camtu-camtu jer.. I didn’t have mood to play actually but we just hang there.. I was playing guitar when Azman came in and saw us.. whatever!               Then we went to Swenson.. At 3pm we got to the front steps of Swenson.. nobody was there yet.. and guess what!?               ATIKAH MADE ME GO TO THE PET WORLD NEXT DOOR!               WHAT THE!?               Never in my life I thought I would even step in that shop!               Its icky, its stinky, its smelly, its dirty, its noisy, its eww-y, its just yucky!               But I was dragged jugak there.. I masuka and got disgusted right away.. the smell is just.. (its bearable) but still.. the top floor doesn’t have cats so I’m kinda save for a while there.. the hamsters were really really cute though! I didn’t see the snakes threre but I did see ferrets! Kinda cool though.. Turtles were there too.. But they’re turtles you know..               We met Fandi and Miza there.. Fandi didn’t look very interested.. Apparently he too were being dragged in there.. Thank god for a partner! When Atikah ajaked me to see the cats downstairs.. atikah.. maybe you didn’t hear me the last 1000 times I told you…                BUT I’M NOT INTO CATS!!!!               Haih.. miza and atikah went downstairs leaving me and Fandi up there.. we were just finding things to talk about.. oklar.. he’s pretty nice.. after what felt like 10 minutes.. I saw Iqbal and Nasriff playing ‘hide-so-Fandi-won’t-see-us’ game.. I was just laughing when he found them.. HAHHAH!               Then all 6 of us went to Swenson.. none of them were there yet but we decided to just went in first.. We had a long table set for all 15 of us.. After making lotsa calls.. only then people start to come..               Tasnim.. Isko.. Diana.. Shameen.. Gg.. Fawwaz.. Iman.. Shahrul.. Zaty.... joined us in order..               I haven’t ordered yet.. when Shahrul came in.. then I ordered.. After eating a whole plate of nasi.. I don’t think I would wanna eat anything heavy.. I’d only settled for ice cream.. which is exactly what I ordered.. A one scoop of vanilla ice cream.. Shahrul ordered IceHouse or sumthing.. and isqo ordered a one free one scoop Pastachio ice cream..               I did eat some pita bread.. NICE! When shahrul ice cream came.. I was starting to wonder what happened to MY ice cream.. its only one scoop ice cream.. All you need to do is scoop it up.. dump it on the plate and serve me.. But I dind’t make a big fuss of it.. until a Pistachio ice cream came.. and guess what I saw..               Isko chowing down my ice cream! Hahaha! I was laughing.. I mean.. couldn’t he tell the differences between Vanilla and Pistachio? Weird..               I just ordered another one then.. We sang Isko his birthday song.. he looked like he enjoyed it.. That’s good..               Masa tgh makan.. we just sembang2 jer.. Shahrul offered me his ice cream.. Atikah.. I think I can eat the ice cream myself… he don’t need to suap me.. its okay.. his ice cream was nice though.. then I felt like I shoud’ve ordered sumthing more.. grand! But whateverlar kan!               We spent about 2 hours and 30 minutes there.. 30minutes for the whole kumpuling duit from everybody thing.. thanks MIZA!! Isko’s birthday dare was to gulp down some tabasco sauce.. its not much but its still pedas! Iqbal joined him too.. they were really red after that! Hahah!               -Its too long already.. I’m continue-ing on the next post!

      listening to : myself think!  mood : happy happy song!  current status : just.. thinking..    its either I'm running out of games to play.. I am too 'glued' to my phone.. I just wanna waste my batteries.. or that I really do enjoy playing Snakes 2..    serious! I've been playing it like 2/7     24/7 means you do sumthing 24 hours in 7 days!  2/7 means you do sumthing 2 hours in 7 days!    hahahah! thats byk right! hahahha!    ok.. so my score now is like 2987! sikit lagi nak 3000! I guess thats why I've been more addicted to it.. I WANNA BREAK MY RECORD!!    but you know what I have discovered? I've discovered how much the game.. is like life itself! really!    ok! lets play 'kaitkan these things'.. think about it..    the snake - us!  the makanan - our goals in life!  the extra food - what we want!    at the beginning of the game, you start out.. free.. independant! you can go whatever course you want! you can go up and down.. go though the wall! I guess thats how you are when you're a kid! free! you can run around! caring about nothing! coz you know.. that there will always be someone to catch you when you fall.. and all you have to do it! enjoy your life as a kid! collecting your goals in life.. and by that age.. its only to be loved always! and its really easy to get what you want! because there are not many rintangan!    when the snake get longer.. we get older.. as a teenager! our life is harder.. our path is more narrow.. and there are uncertainty about the path that we will choose.. our choices are less.. and we have to jaga where we step into! jaga everything! and by now.. what we want! is not as easy to get as it was when we were little! as a teenager.. not getting what we want just.. sucks! since we're so use to it.. but we have to know.. that getting what we want.. cannot matter to you as much! as what we really have to go for! is our goals!    now you're all grown up.. you have chosen your path.. and all you can do is.. go trhough the same path.. on every round.. because you have to jaga to stay alive.. you're too long by then.. and what you want! you only get it if your lucky! if it comes in near you! but all you have to go for.. is you goals.. its what you have go for! what you live for by then! you'd be doing the same thing.. going through the same path you ahve chosen when you were a teenager.. and stick with it.. coz if you don't.. you'd bid your last goodbye!    when u think you're old enough and can't stay longer.. that your path is getting harder.. and you're getting older (longer), you feel like, you can't fight for more.. and then you'll fall! its     GAME OVER!!    poeple might not agree with me! but this is what I think about life its a challenge! you are who you are.. what you go for is your goals! and you'll only get what you want! when you have the chance! you can't get what you want everytime you wish for it! life is not like that!     Life is just A GAME!    shahrul! this was what I was thinking of when you asked me what I was thinking..    - you go for what you need! and you get what you want when you can!

      I dedicate this song to SC..  I looked away Then I looked back at you You tried to say Things that you can't undo If I had my way I'd never get over you Today's the day I pray that we make it through Make it through the fall Make it through it all  -chorus- I don't want to fall to pieces I just want to sit and stare at you I don't want to talk about it I don't want a conversation I just want to cry in front of you I don't want to talk about it 'cause I'm in love with you  You're the only one I'd be with 'til the end When I come undone You bring me back again Back under the stars Back into your arms  -chorus-  Want to know who you are Want to know where to start I want to know what this means Want to know how to feel Want to know what is real I want to know everything, everything  -chorus(x2)-  I'm in love with you 'cause I'm in love with you I'm in love with you I'm in love with you  -AVRIL'S songs are the COOLEST!!

         There's a place off Ocean Avenue   Where I used to sit and talk with you   We were both 16 and it felt so right   Sleeping all day, staying up all night   Staying up all night      There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street   We would walk on the beach in our bare feet   We were both 18 and it felt so right   Sleeping all day, staying up all night   Staying up all night      If I could find you now things would get better   We could leave this town and run forever   Let your waves crash down on me and take me away      There's a piece of you that's here with me   It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see   When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by   I can make believe that you're here tonight   That you're here tonight      If I could find you now things would get better   We could leave this town and run forever   I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together   Let your waves crash down on me and take me away      I remember the look in your eyes   When I told you that this was goodbye   You were begging me not tonight   Not here, not now   We're looking up at the same night sky   And keep pretending the sun will not rise   Be together for one more night   Somewhere, somehow      If I could find you now things would get better   We could leave this town and run forever   I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together   Let your waves crash down on me and take me away        -  this song is so damn NICE!

         Listening to : Avril Lavigne – Forgotten     Mood : plain     Current status : scared that mom will bangun               I’m addicted to songs I’m telling you! I’m not exactly a RADIO person.. I’m more of a.. ‘watch the song with the video clip’ kinda person.. but since I’m suppose to study and stuff.. I have to pasang radio to keep me from getting bored.. And now I’m addicted to songs!               Ocean Avenue [YellowCard] – I always get up to my feet to DANCE and PRACE around the room singing the chorus of the song (since basically that’s the only part I know anyways).. and just jumping up and down and getting all crazy! I LOVE THIS SONG! It’s a special song for me..               Pieces of Me [Ashlee Simpsons] – I LOVE THIS SONG! But I haven’t heard this song lately.. I’m always late for the top 20 songs and this song is around no. 19 so I don’t hear it much.. but its one of the best song ever! I can relate to it.. to the song I mean.. I hope to hear it soon..               Leave [13 year old JoJo] – seriously.. If I knew that you could ditch school and become a singer at the age of 13! I would’ve had two albums by now! Hahah! Just kidding! Not that I have the voice anyways.. But I praise her! She rocks! Her song does anyways! AND SHE’S 13!!               Superstar [Jamelia] – ok ok! Getting bored of this song!I was crazy about it a few weeks ago.. Whenever I listen to it.. I’ll grab the remote and pretend it as a mike and act like a superstar whilst singing it! Hahahah! Live life a little!               Falls On Me [Third Eye Blind? I’m not sure!] – I LOVE THIS SONG! Hahahahah! Serious! It’s a really cool song.. And I kinda like his voice.. It’s a really cool song and stuff!               Love Is Only A Feeling [ The Darkness ] – not much into the song! Its kinda ok I guess.. I just dgr je lagu nih.. this song is more of a.. ‘ok I need to concentrate on my reading for a while.. tell me when the song is done!’ Kinda song               In The Shadow [ The Resmus ] – no wonder you guys love this song so much! Sedap lar! I love this song too! Its so.. dark! Hahah! I dunno.. the guys of the band are pretty scary though.. dark hair and dark everything you know.. gothic? But they’re osng is pretty cool!               The new song [ Blue ] – TAK BEST!!!!               The Reason [ Hoobastank ] – Basically, whenever I hear this song.. I’ll rush to my room.. Grab my drums sticks.. Grab a chair.. and play the song on my imaginary drums set! Hahahah! Seriously, I Do! Nak practise or stuff like that lar.. I am p[retty tired of the song already! TOO MUCH!               Check It Out [ Beastie Boys ] – lets just say.. Its not my kind of music.. NOPE!               Burn [ Usher ] – I like Yeah! better!               Roses [ Outkast ] – Can’t get enough of the song! At least not yet! But I like to watch the videoclip better! Its so interesting! I LOVE THE VIDEO CLIP! Hahhaha! It makes the song more.. like-able.. hahahah!               Are You Gonna Be My Girl? [ The Jets ] – Getting bored of it..               These are most of the songs I hear a lot! Theres more of course but I can’t think of any right now! Maybe in 2 weeks, I’ll write another one of this again and you can see if Pieces Of Me is still on the top list!               - 2 albums I tell you!  2!!

      no! I'm not putting in the songs just because I want to fill in my blog or wanna show off that I know lyrics of songs OR to just put in songs I currently am into.. NOPE!    ITS NOT THAT!    song that I put in my blog is basically showing how my life is at the moment.. how I feel.. how I am.. and I just think its kinda cool that tehre are songs that can relate to my owh-so-biasa life..    I guess if you see angsty songs in there then thats how I am feeling then.. so far I don't think there are angsty songs so I'm fine.. besides.. I don't think I'd be in the mood to put in songs while I'm angsty.. hahah!    this post is just so you guys know the point of me putting in all these songs.. but nonetheless.. I do love these songs too..    - songs about me!

              On a Monday, I am waiting  Tuesday, I am fading  And by Wednesday, I can't sleep  Then the phone rings, I hear you  And the darkness is a clear view  Cuz you've come to rescue me    Fall... With you, I fall so fast  I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts     [Chorus:]   Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I like the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me    I am moody, messy  I get restless, and it's senseless  How you never seem to care    When I'm angry, you listen  Make me happy is your mission  And you won't stop til I'm there    Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast  Well, I hit that bottom  Crash, you're all I have     [Chorus:]   Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I like the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me    How do you know everything I'm about to say?  Am I that obvious?  And if it's written on my face...  I hope it never goes away... yeah    On a Monday, I am waiting  And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...  So I can breathe     [Chorus:]   Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I like the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  Ohhhhh  I love how you can tell  Ohhhhh  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...         -ashlee simpsons ROCK!

         Listening to : Omar Khan – Baby (ok ok.. miza ur rite.. lagu nih sedap!)     Mood : biasa     Current Status : falling in love with the song..               ARGH!! We have to nyanyi infront of the whole damn school today!!!! I got to school and got excited.. ahahha.. not coz I can’t wait to sing.. just the thought of having to sing in front was terrifying.. I tried to hafal the lagu and I kinda did.. hahaha..               Call me semangat! (and I don’t mean literally Omar!)               We just lined up at the back of the tiang bendera thingy.. me and diana were just laughing before we sang.. and masa tgh nyanyi ada lar parts where we laughed but kena cover and stuff.. it was kinda fun but nerve wrecking.. ahhaha! Song was nice though.. when I haven’t got tired of it!               Melisa told me that having to stand in front of shahrul and sing was annoying.. he kept saying ‘melisa busuk’ or something like that.. I told her that I would marah shahrul.. hahahah!               The whole 3 periods of KH.. OMG! BORINGNYA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We just talked and DANCED!! HAHAHA! Best giler tau!               Masa BI.. I just.. haih.. dunnolar.. I just got all crazy! You know.. like I always am.. you would too if you’re just sitting there doing NOTHING! Then diana and zaty wrote               BERNARD – shahrul           LIKES         BERNIE – farisa               And passed it to a whole lot of people.. and now zakhreen and shafiq has been teasing me about it.. ARGH!! When zaty was gonna pass it to ereeq, I blocked her and there was the whole struggling for the paper thing… and I knocked of Chiang Shih Wei’s water bottle.. water just spilled on the floor.. A WHOLE LOT OF WATER!               And I had to pay him back… I only brought RM2 and now instead of 2 cups of fries.. I only get to eat one.. haih.. but whateverla kan..               On the way to the canteen, atikah and diana were going all               BERNARD AND BERNIE!!               And I just walked ahead of them by a few steps to get away from it.. shahrul, ereeq and barr (CHOCOLATE BAR!! HAHAHAH!) was in front of me.. pushing each other.. shahrul pused barr (HAHAHHAHAHA!!!) into a puddle but he just dpt tahan or something.. and ereeq pushed shahrul into the puddle of mud and he felt straight into it.. he fell right in front of my eyes.. and I was stunned.. it was pretty funny to see him fall but he was wet all over.. (he really should put on more weight.. but don’t go overboard!)    I couldn’t do anything.. I mean I can’t go to him and just go all ‘honey are you ok?’ eee… I’m getting disgusted myself.. so I was just bising the whole time.. saying stuff.. getting mad at ereeq and stuff.. diana and atikah were laughing I think.. I just bising2 and stuff (but I said this already.. ahahha!).. when I met nasriff, I asked him how shahrul was doing.. and he said that shahrul was at the PBSM room coz his hand was cut or something.. is it weird that I freaked out about that?               Atikah and I went to the PBSM room to see him after we ate.. he changed into ereeq’s shirt and his hair was wet.. hahah.. he looked cute.. (ok.. ok..) I was just there.. waiting for him.. with atikah and ereeq.. the girls of the PBSM room were putting bandages or something.. that’s when shafiq and azman joined us.. there were many people then.. who knows why.. he’s so popular a lot of people went to see how he was doing.. he was ok..               When I got to class.. I was just still defending the whole..               BERNARD AND BERNIE!               On the way to agama class, I saw him at the canteen eating.. he looks fine so I’m like.. oklar.. agama class wasn’t very fun.. I didn’t have the mood or I dunno lar..               Balik2 ada geografi pulak.. haih.. 2 periods of BORING geografi.. we did get to draw different types of pukat though.. that’s kinda fun! Hahaha!                Masa math.. I dunno why but I got angsty.. I just wasn’t in the mood.. I buat my math jer and stuff.. itupun sekerat jln.. takda mood.. I was sitting at hon lin’s place sekejap and I scribbled the word SC on his table.. shafiq saw and asked me what SC was and I just smiled and got up and walked away..               Masa nak balik.. I just walked with shahrul.. he said he was fine so whateverlar kan.. a lot of people saw us walking together and they were just smiling and going all.. ‘shahrul…’ pretty embarrassing really.. and shafiq on the on the hand was just going up to us and nyanyi-ing and stuff.. he kept coming byk kali pulak tuh.. apalah..                When we met imran on the way, he told shahrul that he stinks and only then that I smelled the stinky-ness.. ahahha.. but tak kisah sgt lar.. we just talked while waiting for fawwaz to come to the bridge.. haha..

         Listening to : liz phair – Why Can’t I?     Mood : I don’t know..     Current status : malas sgt nak buat apa-apa..               Tuesday – after the whole iesqo’s dad incident, most of the guys didn’t come to school the next day to go mengebumikan the body.. they’re really good friends.. iesqo is very lucky.. the whole day my mind was just thinking about the whole incident.. most of us just senyap jer.. thinking about it too.. really depressing..               Masa pj, me and diana wasn’t up for playing anything so we went to find Mr. Jaacob and ajaked him pergi rumah iesqo to see how he was doing.. lucky he agreed.. Shafiq, Aie and Sachin also went with us.. we just hung out at the house for about 20 minutes.. hahaha.. doing nothing.. we wanted to chat with iesqo but it seems weird coz me and diana are not very close to him and we’re girl and stuff.. but still.. he looked fine..               When we got back to school, I just got really depressed.. which leads to this other thing that really sucks too.. but whatever! I dunno why but I missed shahrul a lot that day.. hahha.. really weird.. I mean, if you think about it.. I saw him in school on Monday, at iesqo’s house on Monday night, and when I went to Iesqo’s house that morning.. ARGH! I dunno why lar..               After school, me and him met up at the bridge (jejantas) in front of the school.. we spent about 2 hours there.. talking.. it was really really fun.. we were just there.. talking for 2 whole hours.. about what.. a lot of stuff.. byk sgt.. and the worst part was.. my tuition teacher and my brother saw us together.. ARGH! that night masa online.. he asked me out again.. to meet me for lunch for the next day.. hahahah…               Wednesday – it was report card day.. I didn’t go to school.. all my friends didn’t go so I’m like.. haih.. at about 11 o’clock, I thought about something that I have to tanya the teacher.. so I ajaked shahir pergi sekolah.. when we got there.. we met tengku shafiq.. we just hung out together.. also, when shafiq indera saw me.. he was all.. ‘shahrul, girlfriend kau dah dtg..’ haih.. apalah..               We just sat there at the canteen.. lepak jap.. then I went to meet the teacher all the way to block flora.. shafiq came to class then to get his bag.. so we just talked for a while while waiting for my turn to talk to the teacher.. he’s really weird person..               When I got back to canteen, me, shahir and shafiq walked back together.. taking pictures and joking around.. its really fun! Hahhaha!               At 4 o’clock, shahrul called and we met at the jejantas again.. but he was really distracted about something coz he said he had to go somwhere and had stuff to do.. I felt weird to be there.. I mean, if he’s busy, he could’ve just cancelled it.. its alright.. Its like, he had to spend time with me.. I just felt kinda guilty and stuff..               Thursday – nothing interesting.. tuition was ok.. the teacher didn’t say anything about what he saw but he didn say something like ‘have you been doing things you shouldn’t have done..’ ARGH!!               Friday – no tecaher for the whole day.. GOD! Boring giler.. what we were doing? I don’t remember.. nothing interesting.. just.. I didn’t go to Iesqo’s house that night coz ada tuition.. the guys went though.. at about 11.40 shahrul masuk net so we just talked like always.. the conversation that night was really nice.. hahah..                Saturday – what do I always do on my Saturday’s? ngaji, classes and classes and stuff lar kan.. when I got to yamaha.. my guitar teacher suruh masuk the studio where we ‘jam’ all the time.. boy’s (afiq his real name..) friends were there playing.. the kinda look like posers so I’m like malas nak layan.. but this one guy.. who knows whats his name.. is a really damn good guitar player.. I was mesmerised by his performance.. they were playing ‘Love is Only A Feeling’ (hahah.. this song reminds me of someone..)               Then we just played lagu the reason once jer.. afiq’s and adlin’s granpa and 8 year old cousin were there too.. I felt uneasy to play the drums yang super loud coz takut the grandpa mati terkejut pulak.. and the cousin was closing his ears.. annoying really.. but mamposlar kan.. main je lar.. they said my drumming was betul already and stuff.. it should be.. having to practise a whole lot of time after I got the song..               Sunday – the whole morning I studied.. then in the afternoon I had to go to my uncle’s house coz its my cousin’s birthday party.. I’m not really close to this side of the family.. and I felt really weird coz my other cousins (yg around my age) wasn’t there.. so I was just there alone.. with all the people I don’t know..               But soon they came and I was all jumping and stuff.. I missed them having to only see them twice a year.. gilakan! Then we played a Harry Potter Happy Family card game.. OMG! Pictures of Daniel and Emma.. I just melted looking at them.. ARGH!!! We played and its fun! They said they got it in england! CURSES!!               I WANT TO GO TO ENGLAND!!!!!!               What would I appreciate when the last time I went to England.. I WAS FREAKING 4 YEARS OLD! By that time.. when asked, I’d probably go all.. ‘Daniel Radcliffe who?’               BITE ME!!               When I got back.. me and ashraf and shahir amin guitar then we went to the padang AND I GOT TO PLAY ON THE SWINGS!! YAY!               That night.. I was doing last minute homework.. hahahah.. then I shamppoed my hair.. then I had to get ready the video player so I can tape the O.C. series for my sister.. (I do this every week so my sister can watch it and not miss any episode.. and what do I get out of all this? Just the happiness of thinking that I did good and helped my sister gain the pleasure of watching her favourite show.. AND WHAT CAN I BUY WITH THAT!?               - am I too nice?

      listening to : Maroon 5 - She Will Be Loved mood : I'm not sure current status : shouldn't have had that asam pedas at 10  Finally! I get to write my little pink blog! I have been here for almost 2 hours now. And baru sekarang boleh tulis. Been busy.  Alright. 3 guesses why today's online time wasn't very FUN!  Hahahhaah! I guess Hamiza, Izzati, Shaen, Saufi and Ereeq knows why.  Yeah. Shahrul wasn't in. Hahahahaha! (Call me obsessed)  And again. Not literally OMar.  He makes me happy, its only natural that I want him around me always.  He is my boyfriend anyways.  So who the f***ing cares if anyone calls me Desperate!~  Yeah. Well at least my day turned out FUN FUN FUN!!  NOT ME!!  I hate the word 'desperate' by the way. Just a heads up!  Serious. By the end of the day, I was feeling very happy that when Nasriff said something that kinda hurt my feelings, I was still smiling. Thinking about today! Hahahah.  Have you ever-  When you go to sleep that night just thinking that, when you woke up that day, you never thought your day would turn out to be FUN! with capital F-U-N!  hahaha! Well. Me like that today!  Waking up that day thinking 'another ordinary Friday'  When I was sleeping, at about 6.40, mama waked me up and I'm still drowsy and stuff, and mama nudged me aside on my bed and joined me. She asked me to peluk her. Hahahah.  Whenever Ma and I have these only me and her time, I'd always be scared. Afraid she will get into the whole 'responsibilty' and 'be careful with guys' and 'belajar dulu' speech. And I still remember when I was form 1, before I go inside the Operation Room, she had thi motehr talk with me, asking me who's my crush and all, and I actually opened up to her. It scared me. I mean, what if that happens again? Especially now that she knows about Shahrul and stuff.  Creepy.  So thats why I made up an excuse to bangun coz I DO NOT want mother-daughter talk with her. Especially when my eyes are half closed and my stinky-baru bangun breathe. I'll shoot the info's right out of my mouth like a bullet train.  I know Ad is having a birthday party after school. So I'm like.  OK!  It wasn't actually 'highlighted' in my day but I was happy to join.  I didn't fit in at first. I mean, some of them, 1/2 of them, aren't exactly, my kind of people. BUt I was ok as long as I stick with Diana.  Me and Shahrul went to call his dad to tell 'em about the party and stuff. Got caught by Ustazah again. Hahahah.  Is she like a sign or something? Saying 'tak elok dua orang'. Coz she's everywhere.  When we got back, the whole 'singing' tradition is over. And when I got to class, I know the first thing I've got to get my hands on is the drinks! I'm dead thirsty.  When its cake time for me and Shahrul, apparently, dah habis. Cruel!  So we just had to take bits of our friend's.  The whole 'clan' now have gotten into 'CAKE FIGHT' mode.  They were throwing ices, cakes and water balloons at each other. I know its fun but its just not my group. So I can't just join in and baling cake at Raja.  When the hectic-ness were taken outside, pieces of cake scattered at most parts of the floor, I decided to do something naughty when I saw that very nice piece of chocolate cake {with its icing} on the floor of the class. And its not even smushed yet.  I ajaked Shahrul masuk the class, get a load of the piece of chocolate cake, and threw it at him. HAHAHAH! too bad he ran. I picked what was left of the cake I threw and ran for him again. Finally I got him and asked to put it on his face. And then, it happened.  SHAHRUL GOT CAKED!!  It was hilarious. He tried to get me back but I ran. Then when we got outside, Diana, Shameen and Sonia were going somewhere. Hamiza and Gg wasn't anywhere in sight, and I dind't wanna be there alone, so I joined them. I didn't feel like going up so I just sent Shameen to the gate and washed my cake smushed hand. hahahha!  When I got back, there was only Shahrul that I could possibly hang out with, so we just went jalan-jalan. Around the school. Then we settled in at the seat ket bengkel yang bawah pokok tuh. (ask me where when we're at school nanti)  We were just looking at pictures and just talking. We saw Gg and Fawwaz and they came to us for a while. Then they left. Then Miza and Fandi came, and left us. Hahhaha.  We planned to pergi Syed. So we just snap a few shots of us together and joined Miza and Fandi.  We had fun there. At Syed I mean.  - again the whole Part 2 thing..

         I watched this show called Table For Two yesterday.. you know the iklan Ponds yang he masukkan his tgn in the popcorn so that he could touch the girl’s hands? Yeah.. theres a whole serie of that.. and this show was really interesting..               The guy was having family problem.. but he wouldn’t wanna tell his girlfriend coz he thinks its personal.. and his girlfriend was all.. worried coz he’s been acting strange and she doesn’t know what..               When she found out.. she was kinda upset but the guy just said sorry and stuff.. and she end up solving the problem for him.. well not exactly solving.. but she told him what he could do and it leads up to something good..               And the guy told the girl to tell her friend the truth about her opinion on the her friend’s art work.. and it lead to something good too..               And then I realized something..               First rule of having a girlfriend/boyfriend :                Telling them stuff you don’t think you can tell other people.. share your problems.. telling them everything.. that’s what having a girlfriend/boyfriend for.. that special someone..               Seeing them being really close gave me a good feeling towards this whole boyfriend/girlfriend thing.. they looked happy.. and just.. it felt special to me.. so that’s it!!               Its just a good feeling..               - Table For Two anyone?

Here goes..               ……………………               We have a bengkel motivasi thingy that morning.. ON agama and bm and stuff.. it was the day before that I only decided to go.. I mean, diana said she’s going and stuff so I’m like.. oklar.. pergi je la kan..               Then when me, miza, fandi and shahrul was waiting for the rest of the group at our usual bench, hamiza asked me if I was going and what to wear.. I’m like.. ok wow! More of my friends are going.. this is gonna be funner.. and stuff and stuff..               So that afternoon, shahrul called me.. we talked for longer than 1 hour.. hahaha! There weren’t so much to talk about but we managed to stay for one whole hour.. I even brought up the ‘me in the operation room’ topic.. hahaha! Tahpalah.. then he told me that he was gonna go to the bengkel thingy with his friends.. hahah! BETTER!!               That night.. we talked for about 2 hours on net.. and I said something that I never said to anyone or never thought I’d say it.. hahaha! Nvr mind…               The next day.. I woked up kinda early since I haveta be at school by 8am.. Shameen came late so I had time to eat.. by the time we got to school.. everyone in our gang dah dtg.. hahaha.. lemme tell you what we were wearing…               Me : my sister’s jeans.. I’ve runned out of jeans to wear.. and her’s is so damn preety so I couldn’t resist.. and this long sleeved blue blouse I got from Roxy.. It like double sleeved but not exactly doubled sleeved.. hahah! Then I wore my red lubang-ed belt and grey sneakers..               Miza : A baby blue ¾ sleeved blouse.. and blue jeans.. she looked sweet there..               Diana : hahaah! Tudung!! Hahah! Nothing bad.. but people said she was ‘ayu’ that day.. gross! I hate being called ‘ayu’.. anyways.. she was wering the only long sleeved shirt she has.. its green colour and she was wearing a track bottom.. black?               Atikah : PINK blouse! Sweet pink! Hahah! I wasn’t sure what pants she was wearing though.. skin colour slacks I think.. she looked sweet anyways.. at least she didn’t wear ‘summerset bay’ skirt again.. ahahah!               Gg : a sweet baby blue short sleeved blouse.. with blue jeans.. she looked simple and sweet..               Shemeen : A long sleeved white blue ‘division’ blouse.. with blue jeans.. I told her to let down her hair but she refused..               Melisa : skin colour slacks with school shirt.. ready for taek-won-don..               Shahrul : His Manchester United (I think!) shirt.. and blue jeans with white red nike shoes.. hahah! He looked cute.. hahaha!               Fandi : Baby blue coloured shirt! (THEY SYNCHRONIZED THEIR OUTFIT AGAIN!!) hahhaha.. nah.. just kidding.. he looked cute too that day..               Fawwaz : His Turkey white shirt I think.. blue jeans..               Ikha (you must think.. what the hec is she doing in this blog?) : she wasn’t wearing tudung.. kinda surprising cos her mom is kinda alim and stuff.. she was wearing a white blouse with skin colour slacks.. her hair is damn pretty though!! Jealous lar nih..               Yeah.. so that’s what we wear to an agama bengkel thingy..               That day was fun.. I don’t understand why people wouldn’t take pink file.. I mean.. its PINK!! Thank god Iqbal has good taste! Hahahah!               The first teacher was pretty fun.. she made jokes and stuff.. second teacher! OMG!! I lost interest after 20/30 minutes.. she kept repeating the same thing anyways.. me and hamiza were just passing notes to each other.. and we were seating right next to each other.. ahhaah!               Third teacher was FUN! She’s from ss17 and she’s really cool.. made cool jokes and just catches our attentions.. She at one time asked me to answer a question, came up to me, and shoved the mike right to my face.. it was pretty close and I’m like.. ‘ ok.. you can step back a little.. ‘.. everyone agrees with me coz most of them just stepped back a little when she point them the mike.. ask Fandi!!               Masa the thing finishes.. I really didn’t want to go for drums class so I puposely stay up after school so I wont have to go for that class.. I haven’t practiced yet.. me and shahrul just hanged out together.. then he went to make a call but his parents weren’t home.. so we both just walked around the school 2 orang jer.. and the 2 ustazah saw us and one went.. ‘jangan pergi bengkel..’ hahah! Buat malu jer.. dah lar we were heading to the direction of the bengkel.. though we weren’t thinking of going there..               Then I had to balik already.. he walked me home!!! Hahahah! That’s so sweet.. coz we don’t go the same way kalau nak balik so we never walked home together.. but he said he wanna teman me so we did.. hahaha! It was fun! But he can’t send me sampai gate coz my mom was somewhere there.. even I was scared to let her see him.. so he just sent me till the corner there..               I was damn tired when I got back.. dunno why.. but terus kena pergi parade.. afiq and adlin didn’t come so I had a 45 minutes guitar class.. I couldn’t even enjoy it coz I was damn tired.. then I went for lunch and went to carrefour.. after that we went to pick ajin from football class.. I was sleeping through the whole time.. then we went to pick up dad’s car from service place.. again I slept through the whole thing..               On the way home the jam was really bad.. me and my brother was sleeping and my mom was in a really bad mood.. she tgh sait gigi and the jam made it worse.. and now she blames my staying up late for internet.. and she band me from it.. but nasib baik I had to cari bm thingy.. so I get to go in..                   Ahad.. nothing speacial.. I did get to eat chocolate jam though.. yum!! Basically my day is just studying.. no fun..        -            we walked home together..

      listening to : jet - are you gonna be my girl mood : biasa current status : bored  ok ok! heres part 2.  I dah malas nak tulis about it. And I tak ingat sgt what happened anyway.  We had fun there at Syed.  The all of us went to hantar Hamiza balik and the guys walked me home.  Fandi and us parted in front of the shcool gate coz his mom is gonna wait there.  So Shahrul and me walked me home.  It was really damn hot then. Like walking into a human sized oven. Burning!  BURN-ING!!  Me and Shahrul were at my house and kakak was talking to the next door neighbour's maid. Before Shahrul left, all 3 of us bonded. Hhahaha..  Serious. We were joking about Shahrul being too thinned. Why? Coz I dera him. Hahahha.. And my maid was having the hots for his brother. (who is married and way younger than her btw) and she ahsn't even met him.  Then on the way to Shell, we made friends with 4 inidian guys. They work on the road there. It was really fun talking to them.  Then Shahrul balik.  So I had fun at home! Thinking about that day!  Thats done!  - Nak buat pahala. 'pahala tu apa?'
