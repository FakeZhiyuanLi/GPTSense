      The way I understand the Big Bang theory is that supposedly some extremely large object existed back some kazillion years ago at the center of the universe until one day it decided to explode.  That explosion then created the planets, stars, etc...  I also read somewhere recently that scientists believed that the expansion of the universe had slowed down considerably making them theorize that eventually everything would be drawn back together again to re-create the extemely large object.  (Which would only explode again at some point)   So, with that said, I have some questions.  1.  Since I've always been told in science class that any object set into motion in space would continue to move forever - unless some opposing force acted upon it.  I do understand the theory of gravity between objects but what gives here - there is no center mass to pull it back into?  (Remember, it exploded, so the large object is gone!)  2.  If the universe is infinite in size....how the heck did they figure out where the center was in the first place?  What if Earth is no where near the center - wouldn't that skew the measurements on movement they took?  Isn't movement is based on the position you are viewing it from?  3.  A simple question....where did this large object come from in the first place?  4.  If the object exploded and all of the pieces headed out in all directions into empty space, when did the pieces have time to gather themselves into large rotating galaxies?  Shouldn't the pieces from a large explosion have continued to head in a straight line forever?

      When referring the arrival of ancent man, many times for a specific species of man, it is described as "Neanderthal man arrived around xxxx thousand years ago"  or "Modern man appeared around xxxx thousand years ago".  Okay, just curious, but where did he "arrive" or "appear" from?  If we are using evolution as a guide, what was he the day before he "arrived", or a year before he "appeared"?  I guess the same goes for any species of animal....but it definitely could use some explanation....

      Okay, here's another good one.  I watched many of these Dinosaur Shows on the Discovery Channel, and the experts claim that birds are decendents of the dinosaurs.  They say that they can tell this by the structure of the bones, etc...  Well, if another famous theory, that the dinosaurs were all wiped out by a giant meteor, is true, how is it that birds are decendents of the dinosaurs?
