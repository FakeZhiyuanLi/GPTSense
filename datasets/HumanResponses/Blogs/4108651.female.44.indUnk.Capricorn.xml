        urlLink    noah&nbsp; urlLink    Everything I need to know about life, I learned from Noah's Ark... One  : Don't miss the boat. Two  : Remember that we are all in the same boat. Three: Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the Ark. Four : Stay fit. When you're 600 yrs old, someone may ask you to build something big. Five : Don't listen to critics; just get on with the job that needs to be done.  Six  : Build your future on high ground. Seven: For safety sake, travel in pairs. Eight: Speed isn't always an advantage. The snails were on board with the cheetahs. Nine : When you're stressed, float a while. Ten  : Remember, the Ark was built by amateurs; the Titanic by professionals. Eleven: No matter the storm, when you are with God, there's always a rainbow waiting. Twelve: GET RID OF THE WOOD PECKERS.

       I usually don't travel out of Atlantic City to work my Part time Security Job, but they called me Thursday and said they really need me for Friday and Saturday. I thought, hey let me do this once, an all day outside concert on Friday, could be fun? Plus I'm off on Fridays from my full time job. Friday Morning 11am I wait at the rest stop on the Garden State Parkway to be picked up. They arrive late at 11:45am in the big green rent a wreck Dodge van that holds 11 people, we have 9. We head North on the Garden State Parkway, 1 hour and 15 minutes, exit 116 comes up and we are off the gsp. Thank God, 1pm we arrive at PNC Bank Art Center. The show is an outdoor event with 2 stages, 5 main bands and 4 smaller bands. The main stage bands are Linkin Park, Korn, Snoop Dogg, and The Used. Stage 2 is ghoustface, downset, m.o.p., funeral for a friend. You can check them out here  http://www.projektrevolution.com/linkinpark.php  So we sign in and wait for our assignments and breaching. I guard a gate and check credentials for people and vehicles to enter the back stage area, no big deal but the heat is terrible standing in the sun on macadam and lifting this long gate up and out stupid temporary set up. It was an 8x10 section of fence on a post. I can feel the sweat dripping down my entire body even the top of my head is sweating, of course I act like the heat isn't bothering me and act pleasant to everyone that approaches me and of course they comment how hot it is and ask how can I stand it and I just smile, ugh. I stand there till about 4pm until I get a new assignment go to stage 1, guard the projector on the top of the hill stage left, keep the aisle clear and make sure only handicap are in the handicap section. Excuse me sir is there something wrong with you, do you belong here? LOL. It's not a bad spot. I can see the show and no real danger for me where I am but it's a pain in the ass. I was told by the supervisor, don't let anyone lean up against the barriers around the projector. Well about 100 people or more though out the concert decide to lean or wait for friends there, so I smile then tell them Please don't lean against the rail, then I walk away. They always look at me stupid like what is the big deal and listen but some like to test you over and over. Most of the people are drunk and or stoned they walk right by you coming from the bathrooms with the half smoked joint on their ear, look at me! I'm stoned. LOL. It rained in short spirts about 3 times just to tease you not to soak you. I was praying for more rain to cool me or darkness. Then the sun would shine through again. Did you ever see a drunk on dry land trying to walk a straight line? Try a drunk walking on a hill then add mud from a little rain, spilt drinks and vomit, yuck LOL. Luckily I had a bottle of water earlier and was near a water fountain so I kept filling the bottle. I probably drank 10 bottles. Did I mention the heat? LOL Two of our guards that I know of were taken away by the emt's probably heat stroke. I had different fights in my area with these drunks in my face telling me, he hit me, she hit me blah blah blah, finally I calmed them down. Most of the time I can talk to them and change their minds on what they want and they go away. There's always that drunk that thinks they are 10 feet tall and bullet proof. So I set an example of the pushy drunk and they are removed from the premises. Then the drunk girl friend starts in on me, she gets in my face and says with a whinnying slurr.. Why, why yah have to do that? I say if you don't get out of my face and find a place to sit down, calm down and watch the concert, I will remove you too. Well long story short... She's otta here. I also had to tend to scattered people passed out, bruised, stepped on, broken ribs or bleeding from moshing crazy, crazy, people. The emt's were constantly running to someone. There were people passed out every where. I'd check on them and they were fine other than so drunk they could not sit up. I could see on the top of the hill moshing it was like waves every where, glad I wasn't in that mess. The Last two bands linkin park and korn were the best part of the night. The crowd is weird at the end. They beg you, can I get autographs, see the band etc. They claim to do anything to get back stage anything and I believe they will. So around 11:30pm we were on our way home a long day and I'm home by 1am. Over all I did have fun. It's was an experience that I wished I had taken pictures or taken videos, words can not describe. You had to see it 18,000 most drunk and/or high and mooshing. Saturday night I worked in Atlantic City at the Boardwalk Hall for Loretta Lynn, a piece of cake. Wow talk about opposites. It's Sunday, I woke up at 10am I was tired. It's raining with thunder. Hmm, what to do today? Maybe a day of nothing is what I need.
