      After sitting outside awhile, Lori and I decided to go to the Post Office to retrieve Grandma's mail. Only problem: we didn't know where it was. We drove around a bit and finally found it. Got the mail, listened to Phantom Planet in the car and came home. Sat some more and watched Spike play, then went to lunch at Hanson's Landing. Had a good bacon grilled cheese. Of course, once we got in the car and started driving, I had to go to the bathroom...went to pier 5 and walked  around and sat on the rocks near the mansions, looking at the ocean. Decided to go to a surf shop that Tom and Lori knew, called Warm Winds Ltd. I got shorts, a tee-shirt and a new $70 bathing suit- didn't look at the price tag before Grandma bought it...duh, and now I feel bad. Went across the street to use the public  bathroom to relieve myself. Then we went for gas and came home. Tom and Lori are leaving...but coming back Friday...Tyler is threatening them with a phone call everyday to remind them to bring Sega Dreamcast so he has something to do. Well, it was a full day. Bobby and Shantel tomorrow...Alicia and  Teddy tomorrow... everythings good right now until I have to go home on Monday and face Driver's Ed.

      Couldn't write until today - long day and very sleepy at the end. Started the morning off waking up and watching television with Uncle Tom, Tyler and the little dog Spike. Then sat outside with them, Aunt Lori and grandma. Played with Spike and got a little sun. Decided later to go to the beach...packed up the car (didn't take Spike)and went to Charleston Beach. It was sunny, but right when we got to the beach, of course, the clouds rolled in. After the sun peeked out a bit, Tyler and I went into the water to boogy board. THE WATER WAS FREEZING! Maybe got a little hypothermia before getting out and sunning on my towel and eating egg-salad sandwiches.Ty and I buried Uncle Tom's feet and got some sand up his shorts!Left the beach and came home to unpack and take showers. Heather got sunburn again!Sat around for a little bit in the house and watched television before decided to go to eat at the Coast Guard House, which overlooks the water. I had cream of broccoli soup and tortellini. It was really nice...then we went to Wal*Mart and while Grandma bought food, Tom, Lori, Tyler and I walked around and looked at toys and fencing that soon became painful as it cut into my foot. Also saw "Heather's boyfriend", this crazy hippie, long-grey-hair guy and a heavyset woman with who he had his hand around. Ugh! Eww! Came home and ate grandma's yummy chocolate cheesecake and watched television upstairs. Then, came downstairs and watched more tv before falling fast asleep in my nice cozy bed....woke up today...still deciding what we're going to do...

      Tyler and Grandma caught an orange cat in a trap with bacon so we took it to the Animal Shelter. The lady took it while Tyler and I looked around at the homeless kittens. They were so cute! Then we went outside with Grandma's neighbor Dave who works at the shelter and we went around back and saw the puppies and big dogs. We saw and ADORABLE little brown beagle/basset puppy who was just born and is one of five pups. Tyler and I wanted it really bad, but of course, we weren't allowed to take it home with us...mom would never let us have a dog even though we have the room for now. Dave said he would try to bring it home with him so we could visit with it on Saturday...hopefully! I told Ty to ask mom but I don't know if he will...and even if he does, the chances are slim that she'll say yes. Alicia left RI at 2:00PM to go back to Marlboro. She's coming back with Teddy on Thursday. Can't wait until they get back...going to Pat's for dinner again tonight. Hot dogs? I want that little brown puppy who runs so cute!

      Woke up this morning and sat on the porch with Grandma. Watched the cat chase birds and try to open the door and get into the house. Ate a banana for breakfast and then some chocolate. Played Spit with Tyler and Solitaire on the computer, watched the Today Show and then got dressed. Met Alicia at Pat's house at 11 to go see Marge's kids, but that didn't go over so well. Margot, Eric, Shawn and Lexit...we didn't really meet them...instead we just stood around and watched Margot carry stuff into her grandmother's house. Then we decided to go to breakfast/brunch/lunch at Tim Horton's (used to be Bess Eaten). Had donuts and came home. Gram and Tyler outside powerwashing the shed...and some chairs??? Alicia and I watched and then ate popcicles and came inside to watch Teletubbies and Rally Round the House??? Not really doing much besides sitting around...maybe we'll see Marge's kids later...?

      SUNDAY, JUNE 27th, 2004 Fooling around in Rhode Island with Tyler, Grandma, Pat and Alicia. Went to Charleston Beach for a couple hours to work on a tan, but it was too windy. Back to Alicia's to swim in the salt pool before coming home. Going to the movies later to see White Chicks and having macaroni and chicken fingers at Pat's house later. Was typing exciting story of aristocracy before it deleted! I'm so tired T may fall asleep right here. Can't wait to go to bed later! Bobby's coming on Thursday...boohoo...and Uncle Tom, Jim, Aunt Marie and Aunt Lori. Le Vie de Moi should get more exciting soon.

       Finally had to leave the comfort of Rhode Island. Went back (miserably and in tears, I should add) to Connecticut with Bobby, Shantel, Marie and Jim. Got dropped off at Grandma Zajac's without Tyler and was left to find my own things to do around there. Started Driver's Ed...it's fun, but I'm still a bit nervous and not ready for the responsibility.&nbsp; But Katie, Shawn, Joe and&nbsp;Rug are in the class so it's a little more fun. Even though I'm completely not really sure about the whole Rug thing anymore...but last time I said that, it didn't really work out, since I still did like him afterwards...ah well, hormones...Painted my room at dad's house baby blue and the rest of the house got painted by the Polish painters (who also sold dad his new Mercedes Benz! Which we named Miles Parker...hehe) It's actually&nbsp;coming&nbsp;out pretty good though...at least gram will be happy about it. Spent some time at Tracy's and just hanging out...we did go to RockyNeck and swam and looked for crabs in the rocks (without luck) and then we went to the Thames River Fireworks..they were amazing! But Lauren and Allie were being a pain in the butt...what else is new? We're in Rhode Island again now, celebrating Gram M's seventy-third birthday...everybody's here, including David and mom which is a surprise since they never like to come down...Spikey is crying in his room...poor guy. Which reminds me that Tyler and I each have two puppies now (stuffed) that we're trying to show mom we can take of real dogs with...so far it isn't working...but hey, I really didn't have hope from the beginning...have to babysit next Friday for Jennifer and Joseph in the one story house and then we're going up to Vermont to finally celebrate Allie's ninth birthday...I don't know what's happening after all of that..Driver's Ed and camping at some point...and we're definitely coming back here when Alicia and Teddy do, but I still haven't found out the exact dates, so I'm not really sure about that...and I still have to finish ready four books and writing about them...whoopie! Until I get the chance at another computer sit-down...this is goodbye...

      Got up...slept better last night...and watched tv in the livingroom with Shantel, Bobby and Tyler. Ate breakfast (poptarts) and then the group decided to go to Burlingame State Park. We got there aroung ten and the boys helped Jim and Marie unload the boat into the water. We went swimming but there were no waves and it was really shallow...like a foot deep...so basically we just floated around on the boards and threw the Splash Bomber ball around. Then Jimmy said that we could go in the boat, so while Shantel was swimming around, he took Bobby, Tyler and I onto the boat and we went around the lake a couple hundred times(not really, but it felt like it under the hot sun...my legs are all burned now). When we got out, like an hour or so later, Gram said that she was taking Shantel home, so I decided to go with them. We took showers and Uncle Tom and Lori were there with the dog Spike and so I sat outside with them. When everyone got back and showered, we sat on the porch and talked and ate some snacks...Gram is still preparing dinner so that should be later...despite all the fun we've had today, I still REALLY wanted to see the kids down the street...maybe later, but doubtful...hopefully we can tomorrow, cuz I only have a few days left and I basically came here to see them...I still am coming down in August, so I need to ask Alicia when they're all coming back. Got to get Pat to ask Vicki some questions...going to eat, but maybe write later if anything remotely interesting happens...Bobby, Tyler and Uncle Tom are playing video games on the old Sega Dreamcast...he remembered to bring it for Tyler without Tyler even calling to remind him.

      Did not sleep at all last night...was up every hour cuz it was hot. Finally got up at 8:30 AM and joined Gram, Bobby and Tyler on the porch to eat breakfast. Shantel didn't get up until 10:00AM! Plus she went to bed late last night....hmm and she has eaten only one meal of the last three...ah well, it's doubtful that a six year old is following in the Mary Kate footsteps of anorexia. Decided to go to the beach...found out that Alicia and Teddy still not here. Ryan and Eric should be coming tonight too. It was completely cloudy and thundering (so, I was having fun...!) but we went swimming anyway...the visibility through the fog was like 5 feet...it was kinda scary) Pat brought along Margot and Lexi, who are kind of lacking in the social and common sense area, but we didn't have to talk to them much because they were in the water the whole time, while we were only half the time boogy boarding and just hanging out in the water, until Gram made us build a sandcastle with Shantel..then Gram, Shantel and I took a walk down the beach to the breachway, but didn't quite make it there, because Shantel wanted to turn around. After the beach we came home, showered and went bowling...the guy said we were too young for bumpers, but I got mad and Gram went over and yelled at him and he gave them to us...played three games, came in third, then second, then first...go Heather! Came home to see the puppies.. they're SOOO cute! I really want one but mom said no...we played with them a bit until one of the two fell asleep and then came home. Grandma said we could go for ice cream after our aunt's and uncle's get here...maybe alicia, teddy and ryan will be here to go with us. Ken Jennings has won twenty days straight on Jeopardy, so I want to watch that again. And mom and dad got my report card finally... I do have a D in math, but they didn't care...I still managed to get second honors...

      Shantel and Bobby came...whoopie! (for the shantel part) and we went out to eat at the Famous Pizza Place. Now we're back home watching television as usual and trying to get everyone to calm down. Alicia and Teddy still not here...nor are Dave's puppies....he said that they are coming tomorrow - maybe Alicia and Teddy are too. Who knows? Can't wait to see them though. Pretty tired from my long day of doing  nothing - sleeping upstairs with Shantel in Grandma's bed...Ty and Bobby downstairs in the old room...kind of tired of switching beds though. Ah well..tomorrow is a new day. A full day with Bobby...someone should kill me.

      Got up early this morning (around 8AM) right after Grandma left for physical therapy. I thought I heard the car roll over the stones and then like five minutes later, I heard it again. I thought I fell asleep and forty five minutes had gone by in like five. But it was just grandma leaving and then I must have heard someone else in their driveway, like Dave. I'm still waiting for him to bring the kitty cats home and we're waiting for Shantel, Bobby, Alicia and Teddy still. Vicky asked us to swim in the pool, but I want to wait until Alicia and Teddy are there...can't wait. We went to the post office and then to Wal*Mart again, where I got the Maroon 5 CD and Ty got 50 Cent. We also spent $2 on homie-like figurines called Palermos. Came home and met up with Pat, who gave us a watermelon, which then Tyler preceded to drop on the stone driveway, and then we came home, saying that we would call her later. We still haven't, so I don't know. Now watching Wimbledon...Serena won! and waiting for the cousins who are coming around 3 or 4 PM. Uncle Bob is taking us out for Pizza when they get here...probably Charleston Famous Pizza...and I can't wait for Alicia and her brother!!!

      We finally got the instructions on how to incorporate pictures in this, so I will be trying to do that soon. Today is Johnny's 9th birthday! YAY! We've been in Rhode Island for the past week and we have a week left...last night was fun what with Hurricane Charley bearing down upon us and all. I was woken up at two in the morning by torrential rains coming through the open window and soaking my pillow. We've been hanging out close to home...playing outside with Teddy and Alicia (who hasn't been here for a few days). We played wiffle ball and went swimming. We went to the beach once and went to watch the surfers at Covington Beach twice. One day the waves were really low and all these little kids were out there, but yesterday, because of the storm, the waves were huge and the teenagers and adults had taken over the surf. I've been watching my OC tapes in between the Olympics...I can't wait for the new season to start...but November 6th is such a random day a long way from now! Last night we went to Pat's for dinner...chicken parm...and then Tyler invited Teddy over but he never came...maybe we'll see him today, but it isn't promising...the weather isn't so hot so a lot of people aren't outside. Grandma's sister-in-law Joan is coming around lunch time and Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Marie are coming with a couple and their two-year-old baby...have to get off line...Gram's waiting for a phone call...probably write later...

      So, I went to Katie Lyn's and went to the FFC for Munchkins and swimming...no broken swings!...and had lots of fun playing board games and eating her mother's ice cream. Driver's Ed is almost over and I finally got my permit! (and got my favorite sign wrong...car on springs!) Going to Rhode Island the ninth, after class, for two weeks...don't know for sure if ALicia nad Teddy will be there still...they're going the first week...but we'll still have fun. Going to Pat's sometime (maybe the seventh?) and also camping. The Spawn of Satan are in California, so no worries there...Katie gave me some great movies...A Walk to Remember and Dirty Dancing Havana Nights...that one was amazing! Oh! And a GREAT movie has occurred....Heathyr and Katie's graduation present will be Pirates of the Caribbean II, which somes out summer 2006! Yay...it really is too bad that we have to wait two years though...Ah, well...it's all worth...and until then we can stare hopelessly at Katie Fo's Orlando Bloom book...I must be going...it's drizzling and we might go bowling?...going back to Dad's later tonight...Oh! We went clothes shopping for school...pink shoes and striped underwear! Oh, and some cool jeans, shirts and belts too...Until I see another keyboard...
