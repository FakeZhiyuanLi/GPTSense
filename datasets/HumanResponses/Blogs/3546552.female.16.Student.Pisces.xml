      this may not make any sense, but since I deleted the last post, well just go with it.  So tonight was better . But I wonder, do you still not get " the sentence "? LOL, you will, someday, you are just too innocent to even want to get it. I like that! so anyway, I still have a big secret that I would like to talk to you about...so if you read this, maybe you can come online and talk to me! I would like that very much, in fact, right now I am praying that you do, because I am bored out of my mind at home and not tired. * yawn * no, really I'm not...Oh, and don't worry, the secret isn't ummmm, wierd, well it sorta is, but it's kinda funny, I hope. ok, well enough said here, just talk to me! ~Kendra

I got up early to go with my mom on some errands, came home to be bored and have to do my independent French course, then, this evening I went to babysit the genius kid...ask me later MR, where the parents were so late that I wasn't even able to go to the party to say goodbye to my good friend who's moving to Texas! pardon me while I vent a little!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH        Alrighty...well, I don't feel any better. My elbow still hurts from injuring it on the car...yes, the car, and my neck is so tense I can't even believe it, I have a terrible headache, and I want to go to bed but I tried and I can't sleep...wanna know why?  CUZ YOU'RE NOT HOME YET !!!!!

      yep, that's what today was. Youth group went a lot better than I had even hoped for. However, I still missed you and your... talents ...lol, no better word I guess. We had a guest speaker, and he was cool, but I missed pastor J too.  O man...if we  EVER  sing  I am Running , ever,  EVER ,   EVER   again...I will have to scream.  I swear, it's Rachel's favorite song, and we sang it through at least  25  times...not even joking. I mean, the first 5 or 6 times it was  OK , but after that many...o man, I was ready to leave the stage. O well, the group seemed to like it, so...whatever. Yeah, so then I went to my girlies' basketball game, while the rest of the people went home because of the  tornado warning ...but I mean, come on guys...this is  Wisconsin , nothing exciting like that  ever  happens around here.  So...anyway, the girls lost their game, but at least I got to see some of my friends.  I went to  Starbucks  with Amanda afterwards, and then to her house...her dog burned his nose in the candle...lol! Not what I expected I'll tell ya. Hope your day was cool, keep havin fun, and don't forget about me...lol. See you soon M.R.! ~kendra

      today was good! I woke up this morning at 10 to go to my school and  unenroll  in the retarded French independent study I'm already in and  re-enroll  in a new one, which will make sooo much more sense! After that, I took my dog to get her hair cut and then went out to lunch with my mom. However, the real highlight of my day, was the fact that cell group was at Sarah Wier's house.  We had fun playing pool and ping pong as well as having deep conversations about boy girl relationships...lol, it was cool though. I missed you, there was no one to finish my sentences or understand my inside jokes. But I know you come back soon! Hope your safe and having lots of fun, making good memories...but not too many withought me!  Talk to you soon. ~kendra

So we all went to Culver's to celebrate. I missed you, but at least it wasn't three hours long...lol. Hope you're doin well down there, and I know you're gettin lots done. See you soon!  ~stella

      I am finally home from my Florida trip and loving my very own bed!  Florida was wonderful, but after seeing a cockroach on the floor the night before we left...well let's just say that I was done. I got home on Thursday around 1:30 in the afternoon and went home to do laundry after taking Michelle and Alice home. Then, I got ready to go again, and went to church to see off my friends leaving on the missions trip to El Salvador. I gave M.R. his pen and carribeaner (sp?), and everyone else their sea shells. I am sad that MR is leaving for 10 days, but somehow I will survive *wink*. Meanwhile, I had my cousin over for a girl movie night and then we went to her sister's graduation party, which was a complete success, considering there was no rain, and it was neither blazing hot nor icy cold! Tomorrow is Father's day, and I am spending it with my mom...how wierd is that?! I am excited to be home, but I miss all of my friends that are gone...esp...well, you know...hehe. I hope to hear from you soon if possible, and if not, I will continue to pray for you and think about you all the time. ~kendra

      Today was absolutely marvelous, and yet...it TOTALLY sucked. Early this morning Michelle, Alice, and I (kendra) got up nice and early to go to the beach! Don't tell, but, I got to drive the hour and a half there, and back (that would be illegal for any of the following, I'm not 25 therefore I cannot drive a rented car, I have only had my license for a little over 3 months therefore I cannot drive two people, and I was speeding like crazy!) so, yeah, the beach was amazing, the waves were very refreshing, huge, and...well, salty (like literally) but anyway, I have never seen anything more beautiful in my life! We went to Ron Jon's surf shop where I bought a t-shirt and Michelle got a skirt! That place is ENORMOUS with swimsuits lining the walls and surfboards gallore! After that, it was back to driving "home" where we were to meet up with Jan, one of the other ladies we went with, and her daughter. When we got home, they were sleeping instead of waiting for us to go to MGM with them, so we packed our things for tomorrow, then, we all went to Downtown Disney which was kind of cool with the LEGO store, however the rest was pretty expensive and rather boring. So anyway, like, an hour after we got there, Jan decided to leave, so we stayed a little longer, but that...I guess wasn't quite what she had in mind. So, when we got home, she was all angry and stupid and wouldn't give us the time of day. ARG! Brip brip brip she brip brip brip that brip brippin brip (ask me later M.R.). ANYWAY...we went in our pool for awhile, and swam with her demon posessed child...yeah, (she growls at us and her favorite word is doogie...(or however you spell that)so draw what conclusions you may. Now, we are eating spaghetti, in our room and are about to go skinny dipping! Hope you are all well and I will see you soon! love you bbye! ~kendra

      quite interesting. Our entire group went to the  Magic Kingdom  where Michelle and I split off from the group and rode all the theme rides!  At lunch time we went to a character dining room where we met these two guys  Isaac  and  Ethan . We walked around with them afterwards and went on a river boat cruise for awhile. They were very friendly. Next the four of us went to  Space Mountain , but it was raining so hard we were soaked by the time we got there and didn't feel like waiting in the 90 minute long line. Instead, we went up to this abandoned ride/building and talked with each other for over an hour. At the end of the day we made plans to meet at the water park tomorrow and I am excited to see them again. It's nice to have more people our age to hang out with.  I hope you at home are having a nice time, ... let me know! Love you all... and a  holla  out to my  M.R ! goodnight all.

      Today we went to the  Animal Kingdom .  The weather was absolutely nasty...it was muggy and hot and the sun felt like  1000  degrees.  However, we saw the  Lion King  in the air conditioned building...thank God...and that absolutely  ROCKED ! Then after all the girls were completely worn out, we went to a restaurant for dinner.  It was inside this  HUGE  hotel/resort thing where all the waitors and waitresses were super loud and kinda strange...but it was soooooo fun!  I asked the waitor for a green crayon, because we had none and he yelled to the entire restaurant to bring green crayons to me and my table! I couldn't stop laughing! So then, after asking him for nearly every color I started to draw on the menu which was just a piece of paper...Apparently, that menu was very near and dear to him however, because he told the entire restaurant that I was drawing on it, and if I continued to do so..he would "punish" me...so...what do you think I did? I drew some more...He was like..."I'll be right back" and he went to the back, coming out with a wooden horse.  He told me I had to ride around the lobby on the horse screaming "I will not damage private property!" I thought it was the funniest thing I ever heard so I went and had a blast skipping around the huge  huge   enormous  lobby screaming at the top of my lungs. I was laughing so hard when I got back! Then, later on, my friend and I asked for more water to drink and our waitress brought back literally a two gallon bucket! she put in huge blue straws and me and my friend just laughed histerically. The waiter guy who made me run around also got something for my friend Michelle...and he told her that she owed him...so on the way out of the restaurant, she said..."Do I still owe you?" and he was like "yeah" so she kissed him on the cheek! it was  THE  funniest and best restaurant experience I've ever  EVER  had! yeah, so here I am writing to you, telling you about my day...I would love to read about yours! write to me! Bye!

      in Florida was great!  We went swimming with the little girls until about 9:30, and then it was just Chel and I.  We stayed up watching Sweet Home Alabama until 1 or so and then went to sleep in our beautiful double twin bed bedroom! This house is amazing, the pool is warm and all the families are just as nice as I remember them from our last trip! I hope  you're having fun at home! Talk to all of you soon...o by the way...Bonjour mon ami, Je t'aime *wink wink* au revior!

      for  Florida ! Whoo hoo...although, I'm not as excited as I thought that I would be. I just realized how much I don't know about what's goin on once we get there, how much money this is really going to cost, and I'm not done packing. Most of all however, I think that I am going to miss my friends and family. Esp...my mom, my Grandpa, and...ahem...others (cough m.r. cough) hehe. I will however, try to write on this website to update you guys on what's going on with me. You can also feel free to write me a "comment" which you can use just like an e-mail to tell me how  you  are! Otherwise I hope you all keep enjoying your summers and I will talk to you when I get back!  Off to the beach now Bye.

      today was great...I went to sleep at 7, like I said, then woke up at 10. After making our chocolate chip pancakes, both Sarah and Amanda left and I had to clean the entire house myself, sleeping bags, dishes, food and all. So that took hours. Then after that, I raced off to Worship team practice which was fine. I talked to two very special people there...hehe...After that I went over to the Cameron house to watch  You Drive Me Crazy  with Lindsey, Ashley and Andrew. The movie was cute and I was having a great day until I came home and my mom almost blew up at me for being a little late.  Sometimes, I really hate my life. It's summer, shouldn't I be able to stay up, and do some fun things with my friends? O well, hopefully I won't get anymore crap in the morning. I just wanna go and cry myself to sleep. The only thing that was good today, was that I got to see two of my favorite people in the world. One can make me laugh and finish all my sentences, and the other, well...yeah. Youth Group should be good tomorrow, but I really hope all my stupid issues will disappear by then so I can enjoy worhip and have no distractions. Goodnight.

      It was Sunday, yes ladies and gentlemen, Sunday...all day! I slept in this morning. Then, after I got up, I was allowed to take the car...by myself and go  shopping ! Whoo hoo! I got to pick out a bunch of new outfits and a new swimsuit for my trip to  Florida .  Which, by the way, starts this Thursday! I am so excited. So then, after shopping, I went to church for worship team and Choir practice after which was the service, where the little kids were amazingly cute and funny...Madeline you my dear, were the best of all! *wink wink* The rest of the service rocked, because  Mr. Headley ...yes MR!!! told a whole bunch of hilarious stories that made everybody laugh. We really felt the joy of the Lord! Kopps was fun after that, although the mosquitos were vicious (hmmm sp?) Then, finally, when I got home, I had the privaledge of talking to my M.R. and that just  MADE  my day! Luv ya M.R! So now it's off to dream land where I get to forget all my worries and cares...o wait, that's right, I don't have any! HAHA school is out for the summer, and I am ready to kick back and relax! Peace everybody!

      the movie  Texas Chainsaw Massacre ...it's really scary. So unless you got a guy to hold onto when you're scared outta your mind...just don't do it. (o by the way if you have seen it...there really is or was no guy with a chainsaw that killed people...ever. the stories of  psycho ,  silence of the lamb s and of course  texas chainsaw massacre  are all based off of a Wisconsin killer  Ed Gein . Yeah ... and he used a pistol to shoot his victims so don't believe everything you hear and see.)

He was singin up a storm, starin into space and talking about dancing! It was great. Then After cell group he, Sarah w. and Ilissa M. came over to my house to watch The Italian Job, and Andrew " Had a bad experience " (that's a line from the movie which he kept repeating over and over at random intervals) HAHAHA. O my, I've never seen him like that before, but let me tell ya, it's pretty darn funny! Have a good day, see you later. ~BS

I was at the  Sideras  house where I practiced my duet with  Rachel Primrose  for  Fine Arts , and then, got into a huge waterfight with  Madeline ,  Phillip  and  Nick . We all ended up drenched and had to eat lunch outside, but I'll tell ya, it was some fun! So now I'm home, and freshly showered...all ready for the next adventure which will be  cell group  considering that both  Andrew  and  Shaun  feel that they are up to it. LOL, I hope  Andrew  doesn't fall asleep! see you in a bit! bye. ~BS

      a couple months late! Today was a blast! We had so much fun at my dad's house playing v-ball, jet-skiing, tubing, swimming, "golf carting" and...ATV-ing...of course, the most exciting part was when Shaun and Andrew tipped the ATV and Andrew ended up in the ER, but otherwise it was a very fun, and quite successful party! I wish you had been there...and I wish you had called when you got home, like you said you would...unless you're not home yet...in which case, I think you are way to fascinated with airplanes! LOL, no jp, I hope you had fun and I'll see you tomorrow MR. Goodnight! ~BS

      yes I'm aware that the date stamp says that...today was good. This morning I mowed the lawn, did my nails, got some more RSVP's for my party, got hooked up with a v-ball net so we can have even more fun tomorrow! YeeHaw, this is gonna be great, I just wish that you could be there the whole time. So yeah, then this afternoon I spent time running some more virus checks on my computer and then I tried to install  AIM  to get rid of the virus and well, you already know this, so yeah, it was a boring day with nothing truly exciting...I just can't stop thinking about tomorrow! I'm so excited...so now I'm off to make a bookmark from my flowers(random I know...)! I can't figure out what to write on it though...hmmm... any suggestions? ~BS  *Each time we have a quarrel it almost breaks my heart, cause I am so afraid that we will have to part. Each night I ask the stars up above ...   why must I be a teenager in love?   One day I feel so happy, next day I feel so sad. I guess I'll learn to take the good with the bad. Each night I ask the stars up above...   why must I be a teenager in love?   I cried a tear for nobody but you. I'll be a lonely one if you should say we're through. Well if you want to make me cry, that won't be so hard to do. If you should say goodbye, I'll still go on loving you. Each night I ask the stars up above ...   why must I be a teenager in love?    ~Dion and the Belmonts  ~haha good song, so cute...yes  cute ...and nice harmonies, I love oldies!

      yes  thinking , all day I felt kinda wierd, like, something was going to happen, but nothing ever did. It was like I was just waiting, but nothing ever came of it. Well yeah, now that I've shared that most  uninteresting, un-understandable  fact with you...we'll just be moving on. So I started the book  Purpose Driven Life  tonight,and I was wondering...no nvm, that joke is sooooo overused, haha. Well just one more thought b4 I head to bed...why does no one write me comments anymore? I really miss having little happy notes to read...*sad face* ...and roses to look at...*tear* all of them just let me know that some one is thinking about me...*sniffle* lol, well anyway, maybe you can write a comment that would make me feel better! goodnight. ~BS

      After seeing close to, if not  THE   dumbest  movie last night with Amanda, and then seeing close to, if not  THE   cutest  movie tonight with her, I started wondering, do people like movies with characters that seem more real, or ones that are fantasy like? Here is my take on the subject...When I go to a movie, I want to be uplifted, cheered up, I want it to make me smile...you know, get warm fuzzies and  all that jazz , so I like the characters to be pretty...or handsome - respectively - I want them to be nearly perfect...you know, funny, cute, happy-go-lucky people. Their interactions during the movie, the feelings...love, happiness...stuff like that...I want that stuff to make me smile, I want it to take away my worries for an hour and a half. But you see, there are many other ways of looking at this subject...one of which is to approach it thinking that you want the movie to make you feel better about yourself and your life. The characters are not perfect, pretty...they don't have the characteristics that make them people of great interest. It makes you think, wow, I've got it pretty good. But see, even these movies sometimes don't make my life look good...lol. Sometimes, I just want to see a good comedy, or a romance...put myself in the heroine's shoes, get to know what it would be like to be in love, to be so happy that nothing could go wrong...and even if things did go wrong that I could rewind and start over, or just wait for my  happily ever afte r ending! Yeah, sometimes, I just wish things were like they are in the movies. Sometimes I just want that perfectly timed kiss under the stars, or even just the warm hand...fingers laced with mine...ok, so now you're thinking... o great she's getting all mushy ...sorry, I'll stop, I just wish it could happen to me ya know? LoL. Goodnight. ~BS

      AMAZING! I talked to my favorite person for like...hmmm well awhile, and we got some good words in! It just feels so good to actually know what's going on and to be able to be open about stuff. I hate letting things build up and then blow up, I'd rather just talk about everything honestly and openly then to hide it all and let it get old. So yeah, now I'm at my girl Amanda's house and we're gonna go watch a movie ... so yeah, more later! bye bye..goodnight MR. ngiyakuthanda. lol  ~BS

      Hey everybody, I'm back from my week of camp and I am happy to report that is was  great ! I had so much fun with all my friends.&nbsp; We played  v-ball , watched some  b-ball  and  soccer  and even  sk8boarding ! It was tight seeing so many people all havin fun together and then all coming together to worship too! The speaker was  Art VanZanten , who rocked and the worship team was  One Accord ! We had service every night, and tons of  wonderful ,  awesome ,    amazing    free time! On the way home I was so tired and hyper at the same time...it was funny. I played the  "alphabet game"  like  500  times...or so it seemed! I thouroughly enjoyed it though...  thouroughly.  &nbsp; So yeah, now I'm home and a little heartbroken, but I suppose I'll live. Do you know the feeling when you  totally  give your heart to someone and it only seems that they are putting on an act, or lying to you? Yeah well, if not, then you're lucky. So here I am writing to you, whoever you are reading this, and I don't know what to say. I had fun at camp, but half of the stuff that happened really isn't worth talking about, and the stuff that is, well no one seems to want to hear it. So now, I suppose I'll just go. Hope you are well, talk to you soon.&nbsp; ~K ooo by the way, I have these song lyrics, tell me what you think of them, and tell me who they are written by, must be a remote artist since I can't really find it anywhere but I know it's a song...    I'm ready to whisper in your ear

      well, only one part of it really. You see, it was all going well until I left my friend's graduation party. I was on the way to my dad's on  Main street  in  menomonee falls , and it goes from 45 to  25  in a matter of about hmmmmm  10  feet. So yeah, as I'm applying the brakes to slow down, this eager beaver cop pulls a 180 from the other side of the street, lights flashing, siren blaring, the whole deal...yeah, so anyway, $120 later, I still say that I was slowing down, but that wasn't good enough. O well, I went straight to my dad and told him, and he was cool with it...he told me not to tell my mom though, and to act like I forgot about it. What good is that though? I have to tell my mom everything so all throughout the movie  Miracle  (the longest movie  EVER ) with  Sarah ,  Alli  and  Andrew , all I can think about is the stupid ticket. Yeah, after they left I told my mom. She said she was glad I told her, and she believed me. So yeah, we're all just glad that my dad's paying for it, and I'm glad that I'm not punished except for the ticket! Yeah, I suppose it was a rather good day...it just better not happen again, or my name is no longer  Miss Chauffer . lol, well hope that you are doin better than me...o and don't tell your mother about this, or you'll never get to drive with me (believe me, I'm a good driver, ask Sarah Wier!) goodnight all, ~kendra

(wow, that was the longest sentence I've ever written haha.) Goodnight  MR . O yeah, and I thought I'd let you know, you missed out on singing  Rachel 's favorite song 25 times again. LOL, au revior! ~kendra

      on this lovely  federal  holiday! Thank you America! So today, I stayed home and watched movies with my  momma ! We had a great time watchin this really wierd movie about a lady in drug rehab...lol,  Sandra Bullock  stars in some of the strangest things. So then, at around 7 I went to  Shaun Eide's  for cell group and we all decided to go to the fireworks at  Mitchell park  in Brookfield! When we got there I saw some people from church and we all hung out together in one big area and watched the show! Afterwards,  Alli, Shaun, Sarah, Andrew R., Jason  and I went to Kopps and had some drumstick custard! Now I am home and getting ready to clean my room cuz it's drivin me insane! I can't find anything and nothing is where I remember putting it! LOL, yeah it's 1130 and I'm gonna clean...haha...o well, mom will be happy.  MR ... ngiyakuthanda ...lol, figure it out yet? I'll give you a hint...I've said the equivalent of it in French to you...   bonne nuit.  ~kendra

      Hey everyone! Hope your holiday was as enjoyable as mine! It all started with the  New Berlin Parade  where I got to watch my cousin ride his  miniature  motorcycle around with his patriotic shirt on. (did I mention that my cousin is  20 ?) yeah so his knees stuck out really far...LOL. Then I went to the church picnic where I got into a water fight with  Zach Brose  and many others who joined in. After getting absolutely soaked I went to the  Cameron 's for a taco dinner courtesy of  Leah , and to watch a movie with  Lindsey  and  Andrew.  Later, we all went to the  State Fair Fireworks  and had a great time playing games and eating puppy chow that  Lindsey  and I had made. I miss you  MR ! I wish you were coming back for cell group and worship team and youth group...ok, so I just wish you were coming back! Life is boring!!LOL, I'll find something to do with myself...maybe I'll  dream ...maybe not! Ha ha! Hope you and your family are having a good time,   HAPPY 4TH OF JULY  !   ~kendra

      Hey everybody! Hope your holiday was as fun as mine was! The day started out with the  New Berlin Par ade, where my cousin rode his  miniature  motorcycle around with his patriotic shirt! (did I mention my cousin is  20 ?) yeah, so anyway, his knees stuck out super far from the bike...lol! It was most certainly a sight to see. So then, I went out to the church picnic. Got into a huge water fight with  Zach Brose  and soon had everyone joining in! After getting completely soaked, I went to the  Cameron  household to have a wonderful taco dinner courtesy of  Leah , and watch a movie with  Lindsey  and  Andrew . We all went to the  State Fair Fireworks  after dinner and had a great time playing games and eating the puppy chow that  Lindsey  and I made. I miss you  MR  and wish that you were coming back for cell group and worship team and youth group...yeah, basically, just wish you were back...life is boring! LOL, o well I'll find something to do with myself...maybe I'll  dream ...hmmmm maybe not! LOL, see you soon!  HAPPY 4TH!   ~kendra

      We just sang in the top ten competition, and Pastor Marsha says we did a great job, so I'll believe her and say...we did a great job! It was a lot of fun, but we defrinately have some competition if you can call it that. Right now we're sitting in the big choir room waiting for the last two choirs to begin at 11:00. Everyone wants to change into jeans so they went to do that...I haven't decided what I'm going to wear yet. I think I might stay i blackbecause it looks better with the red shirt, and yet my jean capris sound really comfy. The choir that just went did a lovely gospel song called Survivor...which reminded me a bit of Destiny's child...lol don't tell them I said that. They were good though. One thing I've noticed is that many of the choirs seem to have soloists or people who quote verses during the song...and EVERYONE sways back and forth. I think the judges must be getting sea sick. Also...most of the choirs have acappella parts it's nice, but let me tell you that some of the choirs cannot hold a tune...maybe it's just that all the instruments or the accompaniments are a little sharp. Well anyway, I'm off for a bit, I might change so yeah, I'll write more later! bye ~BS

      well not so much...sorry. I went into the art exhibition room and looked for your graphic design...FINALLY, when I found it, I asked the lady if there was a score for any of the art and she said that none of the scores are announced for that until Thursday or Friday. I wish I could tell you...well, I think that you should get an amazing, perfect score...but ya know, not everyone is quite like me...hehe *wink* alright, time to get going, if PJ finds me on the computer again I'm bound not to come home! lol I'll see you soon and talk to you sooner! ngiyakuthanda...or "loke" er whatever...LOL bye bye. ~BS

      HECTIC! We rode on the bus again for like 4 hours watching Aladdin,  Annie, and Remember the Titans. Everybody complained about EVERYTHING today and it seemed like everyone was in a bad mood. So yeah, then we got to the convention center and checked in, however they made so many errors in our scheduling that we were there for a couple of hours. YIKES. While we were there however, Hannah and a few others went into a room with a piano and started doing worship songs ...before long, our entire choir was in there clapping, singing the works...not long after that we had another choir join us and it was awesome, I have to go! talk to you soon, glad you're home, keep having fun, bye bye. ~BS

      Hey everybody, I'm in Texas with my homies...aka...Brookfield Assembly youth choir. We arrived safely and on schedule for like the first time EVER! The Hotel is really nice and but the people here in Texas are kinda rude. They are really pushy and they're really blunt. So anyway, I miss you and hope you are having a good time...shout outs to my buddy Sarah W. and my MR! See you soon! bye bye! ~BS
