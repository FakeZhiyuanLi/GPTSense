      So...I'm listening to Weirdsville radio, just because it's there, I don't have to get up to change the CD, and because it's keeping me from getting up and taking a shower, so that I can go to my mom's, and see if my records have arrived from Sweden yet.   Such nice people in Sweden.  I have had some very nice musicians and label owners filling my inbox with recommendations and links to MP3s for a week or so now.  All except for one guy (Hormones In Abundance) who never answered.  However, his site doesn't seem to be updated, so it's very possible he doesn't really check that email much.  I still love his music though.  Because he wears his Rubinoos T shirt with dignity, you know...  Plowing through Pliny.  I haven't enjoyed an ancient Roman this much since I discovered Plautus in High School, after seeing A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum.  (I originally just got that film because the great Buster Keaton did his last role in it. )   I wonder if I wrote that last paragraph so as to seem impressively intelligent.  I'm very concious of this kind of thing.  Don't want to come off as pretentious.  I really try to avoid that at all costs.  I need this song: Everlasting Gobstoppers- Walter Scharf.  It's got sound samples from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is, as everyone knows, one of the greatest movies EVER.  Anything written by Roald Dahl just has to be good.  Even if he hated the film.   Funny about Roald Dahl.  From what I've read about him, he wasn't the nicest person in the world.  Kind of crabby.  I kind of like that about him.  I wonder how many people would read Harry Potter books if Rowling was a mean old woman, who hated everyone....  Okay, so I guess that's enough sunny for one day.  I'm thinking of maybe using this blog as a media dump.  Like, if I hear a song/CD/whatever that I like, I'll sort of semi-review it here.  Same with movies and books.  Maybe I'll use this as my pop culture repository.  That makes sense, since Livejournal is my diary basically.

      This is my very first post here. I created this blog to comment on something else...So, what do I use this one for? I've already got a good blog going at Livejournal, where I pretty much discuss all facets of my life. However, I don't let people read that one. Perhaps this will be the sunny, public face of Xapno. Yes... I will point people to this when I want them to see how charming, witty, and intelligent I am.  That was my mistake, see. My GF just dumped me. She had a link to the old, bilious blog. Had I created this one, she may not have left me. Actually, she left me because she got pregnant, and is now being pressured to marry the daddy. Ah, the South. Tolerant and open-minded to the last. (Am I bitter about this? Oh yes. I'm even more bitter that it was so easy to leave me, in order to appease her MOTHER. She's 22 years old, and still has to do what her mom says... Sigh. Of course, the fact that I'm another woman would have made her mother's head explode, so she never actually mentioned that I exist. Hmm, maybe it's better for me that I got dumped.)  Anyway, relationship woes are for the other blog. This is sunny, joyful, listening to Polyphonic Spree's first album me. Oh yeah. Holiday...Hideaway...Soon You'll Find the Answer... Okay. Have now been calmed by the three thousand people on this CD into peacefullness. I'm sure my lesbian girlfriend will be very happy married to a selfish prick who she doesn't love, just so mama will come over for Thanksgiving. Best of luck to them all.  Reading the Letters of the Younger Pliny. Boy, if he liked you, he went all out. I'm getting a nice portrait of ancient Rome, and enjoying it immensely. I haven't gotten very far yet, but I'm totally absorbed. I have Pliny the Elder's writings, but who wants to read Natural History stuff, when you can get gossippy, conversational letters? I mean, he's already bitched about how much work he has to do, and whined about an aquaintence that tries to screw with him. It's excellent.  Today is my pop's birthday, so that means everyone will be heading over here soon, so that my dad can make us go to eat some extremely nasty German food. UGH. No offense to the Germans, but there is possibly a reason why your cuisine hasn't made it big over here... No one but him likes it. I had a gum infection earlier this week. Not that I still want to hurt like that, but it would be nice to have a built in excuse. I think I'll just ask for a bowl of that pasta like stuff they give out with the entrees. At least that way, I won't risk squirting the grease into someone's eye...  Oops, not being very sunny, am I. Must go over to Livejournal, and spew some negativity for a while.
