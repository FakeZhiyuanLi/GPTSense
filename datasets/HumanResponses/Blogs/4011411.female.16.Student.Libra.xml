JB Waterfront Lot 1 it was called. but, funny thing was, the place was totally empty. shops were empty there. haha. at last we reached the bus stop.. can't wait to sit at the bench there sia... so fuckin tired already n sweating like hell. luckily, a bus arrived n before we board it, we took a snap first.. i'm trying to find a way how to show the pix we took dat day in Danga Bay..    anywayz, we finally reached Danga Bay... our destination for the day.... haha... the place was nice. beautiful.. i like the concept of waterfall thing. the decoration itself caught my attention. we took pix there.. but still, i dun like the weather lar.. itz too hot! den we walked further.. den we came upon diz boat ride thing.. hmm... i liked that idea.. we had to wear the safety jacket.. we got into the boat but there were other peepz in there too. a chinese family of 6 i tink. but we were having fun there.. the water smelled of  kerang . hahaa! pix were taken.. haha! we were always taking pix.. the weather was still hot. but the wind somehow saves mi from fainting or anything worse.. it was blowing real hard as if it was trying to block the boat from going forwars.. haha... the journey took about half an hour.. the driver brought us around the sea.. there were houses on the sea.. i guessed they muz be the fishermen's.    finally, we were back at the dock. i felt quite shaky u knoe.. haha.. the hot weather plus the sea! whoo... i was lucky enough i din faint or puke. later on, we went over to the eating place... yeah... we were so tired after the long walk.. i was hungry still.. wanted to eat chicken.. dunno y.. wanted to try the claypot thing.. but den, stupid lar.. the shop wasnt opened yet.. it was already like 2+pm u knoe... haiz... so i ended up buying mixed dished rice. it was ok though.. oni hard to eat the chicken. i bought iced milo.. ate a stupid looking pizza which i tink by right was not a pizza at all..    skali after we all finished eating, i found out that my lil bro was missing! i told my mom who was way across the table... den we were all looking for him.. i was worried sia... of course lar.. who wouldnt.. my cute little bro went missing in the middle of nowhere.. i mean, come on lar... dat place was huge! in johor somemore... even if it would have been in singapore, i might panic too! my sis n i was looking at the other side of the place... wondering where he might be... haiz... but of course we found him in the end... knoe where he went?? hahaa... the toilet! ~sigh~ luckily he was founded.. yeah.. even though he oni went to the toilet, he made all of us worried and panicked. he should have informed someone u see....    later on.. we went to diz shopping place.. called Plaza Angsana. i wanted to look for a bag.. remember my bag strap  putus ? haiz... so the shopping mall was quite big. hmm... there was diz stage dunnoe wot event was on. but later on wen i was at the second level, i saw Maya Karin.. damn.. she was beautiful.. haiz.... i like her.. watched her acting in Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam.. it was a nice one.. u watched yet?? heez.. watch hor.. den after dat, i went to the bag shop with my mom.. there were lotz of nice bags.. i chose diz red converse bag.. it is nice lar.. i asked my mom to buy that.. guess how much it cost?  RM 69.90!!!  it was quite expensive ar.. but den my mom paid RM 60 for it.. dat is about S$30. i tink it cost ok lar.. hehee... the guy was quite good looking too.. hmm.. but wot a pity i wont be able to look at him again.. haha.. now now... forget abt dat guy.    we went back to the taxi stand outside the plaza to get back home.. heez... the weather was still blazingly hot. at the customs, the queue was sooo long.. my legs were like jelly already.. hahaaa... finally wen we got off the customs, we took bus 912 which brought us to my home.. hehe.. my relatives stayed over at my house for a few hours to rest.. n we look at the pix we took on the computer.. hahax! it was fun to be together with my cousins... n family outings... on the whole, it was a tiring but fun n memorable journey to Danga Bay, Johor.   ok peepz... i've created a website which i uploaded pix taken at Danga Bay... hope u enjoy browsing through the web!  urlLink Click here!

Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan was located at Tanjong Pagar... at Telok Ayer Street... very near V.E.... got it??? n i know how to get there... so my lil' bro n i took bus 75 to Tanjong Pagar...    wen we reached the building, my starrylink745 fren sms me... asked if i'd told  sam one that her interview had been cancelled... haiz... so i called him up... den can ask me to tell my fren that she had to inform him herself.. if not, the situation will not be acknowledged... wah lao! so stuck up, i tell u... den he told me he want to see me for a while.. i told him i was with my lil' bro... we were there like, about 12.30pm... n he want to meet like about 1.30pm.. wah lao eh.. muz wait some more... ok lor i wait... den i brought my bro to China Square.. sat at the restaurant... u know, near the Delifrance n McDonalds... how i wish i had asked my parents for some money before going out... my bro was a lil hungry... but i have nothing to buy him food..  sam one had told me earlier that we'd have lunch together...   huh!   like real...    wen we met... he juz talk talk talk lor... wah lao... we were outside MY JOINT.. there were V.E peepz out there too lor... so i was like controlling my feelings... tried not to be too emotional there.. den, i was about to go back home, n he tot i was going to cry again... wotdafuck! he thinks i'm a crybaby??? but actually i was on the verge to cry... but hey... i was controlling it ok... i didn't cry then. he told me to call him the next day at 10am...   10am!   cuz he want to come over my house to speak to my parents.     ok fine, know wot? i did call him at 10am. but he didn't pick up! i called so many times.. i bet he was still sleeping wen i called. then he called me back. twice. but den i juz finished bathing at that time... cannot answer the call yet. but i tried to call him back. on the second dial, he answered. but told me to call him back 5 min later. i did.. exactly 5 min later lor. told me that he had interviews and other stuffs to do first. said that he will call me when everything's over n dat he want me to fetch him at Woodlands control station... ok never mind.. fine... i waited until the evening.. up till the night.. haiz... he never called... was he busy? did he forget about the call? or was he juz can't be bothered to come over my house, thinking that it is a waste of time? either way, he should have    at least    called me to inform or apologise that he couldn't make it.   wot iz he playing at??   so insensitive lor... mi like heartbreak like that... i wonder wen i will come down again to V.E again...
