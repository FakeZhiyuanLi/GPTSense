      OK, I missed 2 more days. I crashed at CJ's house 3 days in a row, so I couldn't really work on it. I'd like to say I'm going to make sure to do it for the next few days, but I'm going to help roof. See my great grandparents roof has like 6 leaks in it, and they've gotten to the age where they can't really work on their house as.......easily as they might have recently been able to. So me, my dad, my uncle, my grandpa, and my cousin are all going. And that means no entries all weekend. (They're one or two lightbulbs away from being able to join the ranks of even the best omish farmers.) Sorry!

      &nbsp;I missed a day, but I have a good excuse. Me and Nikki talked for the last time we are ever going to. I tried to get her to take me back, maybe to get her to forgive me. It didn't work. In the end I was too untrustworthy to be loved. I'm not mad at her, not in the slightest. I'm only upset with myself for messing up in the first place. Now we can't even be friends, I think we could be, but she doesn't. I really don't want to have to put her out of my life, but I can respect her wishes. I guess I'm never going to see her again, outside of school next year. We can look at each other and pretend like it never happened. The only upside about all this is that now I don't have to worry about if she's better off with or without me, she didnt seem to have any trouble answering that question. The thing that made me saddest was that near the end of the conversation, she said she was happy that this was ending. Halfway through the conversation she told me&nbsp;she thought she might have loved me, and it felt like someone had taken a knife to my heart. But I realized at the end of the conversation that if she can actually be happy this is ending, then it never was love. I told her this, along with some other harsh words at the end. I now wish I hadn't. I don't know how hard she took these words, but I think she was just trying to be strong. I think I can now feel how she did. I'll put something in here, it's what I wrote last night. It's still crap, I'm not quite back to how I used to be, but I think I'm getting there.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FALLEN ANGEL  Torn at the seams My world is divided Stripped of it's wings the angel is blinded The once glorious and admired fallen to Earth Walking amongst us, walking in fire His limitless ambitions now burdened with restrictions The homeless purity reduced to crime no longer able to pass judgement his own convictions, has mimed once beloved once banished he looks at the world with his new 3rd eye seeing this is where he must live this is where he must die burst into tears he begins his eternal weep silenced only to those who&nbsp;cannot not to hear so their sanity, they may keep for the cry of an angel was not meant to be heard

      Tonight me and Nikki actually talked the way we should have talked before.&nbsp;I showed her this thing&nbsp;I've been writing, despite my&nbsp;saying that I wouldn't show anyone this, or even TELL anyone about this. But I just had to try to let her know how I was feeling, maybe help her realize how strongly I felt, and still feel, about her. Me and her talked for hours and I don't know if it helped any or if it got her feeling any better, but near the end there was a comment that I'm kind of hoping wasn't for real. I don't want her to like me, and I do want her to like me, eventually one side of me will win, and I think it's going to be the latter.... I just want to make it clear that despite someone else reading this, everything I say in it will be true, I will not let myself lie about how I feel just so that someone might find it to be easier to cope with. If someone else ever reads this again. (Which doesn't seem that farfetched since within 2 weeks I've already let Nikki read it.) "Why can't I appreciate the things that are dearest to me until I've lost them." I don't know who said that, but it's nothing but the truth.

      Today I didn't really do anything besides FINALLY talking to Cory. I know she is usually a huge help to me and can make everything easier, but she just didn't seem all that good herself. I'm pretty sure there is something going on with her right now that she doesnt want to tell me, either because she doesn't want to focus on her when she thinks I'm having bigger troubles than w/e it is that is bugging her, or it's something I shouldn't hear. Earlier today I took Zoe to the park. I still don't know where these kids get their energy, or how repetitively going down the same old red slide 100 times can be that much fun. She was afraid to do some of the harder things, but I got her to do them anyways, by the time we were done she would do them by herself. She always looked so proud whenever she did something new by herself, it's pretty cool. Trav left on vacation for a week, and I left my sex-box at his house! Cj's supposed to call me tomorrow and we'll probably figure something out to do. I hope he doesnt think that I'm only going to hang out with him now that Travis left. But maybe that's the truth, I really don't know. I don't want to say that I'm better friends with either Travis or CJ, but I think it actually might be starting to be Trav, but I'm not sure, so don't take that for anything. I had a weird dream last night, I can't remember all of it. I went to a concert in a space ship that was carrying around 25 people, and CJ and Trav were there. There were a few other spaceships going to the same concert, just a sidenote. Well I never actually saw the concert, or don't remember it. Afterwards I was waiting for a long time for CJ and Trav to show up so we could get back on the spaceship and go back. But they never showed and the spaceships were leaving. So I stayed behind and still waited for them. Days went by and new bands were going into the concert hall but still I waited. As soon as I gave up, they showed up. Then the dream ended. I'm having&nbsp;a hard time interpreting this dream, but it has to mean something. W/e, time to go make more. lol.

      Take a guess what happened? Who saw it coming? Me and Nikki are over. "Just Friends" Isn't that special? No guy likes to hear those 4 words, but I hear it a lot. I guess maybe we just weren't&nbsp;meant to be. It felt right tho. It's weird, I kind of feel relieved, so maybe it wasn't that right. Or maybe I'm just lying to myself. Maybe if I had tried to get in touch with her a little more, or done something right, this wouldn't have happened. Well now I've got a open schedule, for the rest of the summer. This is kind of embarassing in all reality. That I could screw things up that bad that quickly and not know the right thing to do. Well I guess it's time to face it, it's over........

      So I did manage to crash at Trav's house. His mom came by and picked me up. It was pretty cool of her, didn't expect it. I got over there and we didn't do much, I just hooked up the sex box and we played for a while. SEX BOX= X BOX. Afterwards instead of having to cram on a phooton, footon, futon, phouton....w/e.....trav said we are crashing outside in a tent he and brandon and ryan had set up and used for the past 2 days. So travis and his bro fell asleep like bricks, and I, as usualy, haven't been able to sleep as easy the past few days. So I got to sit up on the hard ground and think to myself, and think to myself, and think to myself. Eventually Trav woke up and saw me sittin there and thought it was the music being too loud..I played along. But right before I went to sleep I finally got hit with the fact that Nikki is probably never going to talk to me ever again, and if she does, it's not going to be on good terms. I really wish I could have talked to Cory through all this, it would have made things 2 million times easier. She would have said something that made me feel better and made me seem like I wasn't the one who screwed up completely. Well I guess it's back to being solo, lotsa fun there. This is my good-bye to Nikki, since I don't know if she's ever going to talk to me again........  Goodbye Nikki, We could have been good, We could have been great, Out of all these things we could have been, I turned it all to hate.

      Yeah, it's going to be hard to keep making up titles for the days that go by, when you take into consideration that nothing exciting ever happens. I spent most of my day eating myself crazy, and in result, getting heartburn. I've been getting heartburn occassionally since I was 12. I don't know why, but it hasnt really freaked anybody out, so why worry? My mom went out on a business trip and will be gone for a few days. WHOO HOO! PARTAY! (Actually this idea wouldn't be too far out of reach if I could somehow find a way to get my dad out of the house for a night, and that's not likely to happen.) Well, there is a downside to my mom being gone. No rides. My dad got this DUI and he can't drive after 4:30, so he's out of question. Trav just called and asked if I wanted to crash, but it's like 9:30 so I can't really bike all the way over there. Ahh well, w/e, it's all good. Yeah, the poem I wrote last night sucked ass. Sorry to use such language, but it was horrible. It sounded more like one of these blog entries than the real thing. I know I just got to get back into the groove of things, eventually I'll be writing like I used to. I think I'm going to head over to chris's tomorrow, maybe have some human interaction outside of my immediate family, or via phone.&nbsp;

      Lately I haven't been doing much. I don't know if it's the whole thing that's going on or if I've just suddenly been overcome with laziness. ;) I just looked at how much I wrote last time and all I have to say is "whoa." Guess I just got carried away. lol. I don't think There's gonna be a lot more of those kinds of entries. But besides that, I haven't really done anything exciting, just been wondering about Nikki. How mad she is and when, if ever, she's going to forgive me. I was uncertain about how I felt about her before, but now I know. If I can be this upset and this worried then there has to be something. I haven't written any poems in a while, I think it's been at least&nbsp;2 weeks. I really should get on that tonight.

      I guess I should make some kind of statement or something since I now think I might get into this "Blog" thing. I'm a teen. God that's an ugly word, but I guess that's what group typical profiling would put me in. It just seems to give off such a stereo-typical vibe, you know the one. "OMG, everything is such a big deal, think maybe I could worry more about the miniscule factors in my life that aren't really&nbsp;a big deal,&nbsp;No! Dawson!" WELL my previous entry would support that&nbsp;painted picture. I guess maybe we all&nbsp;have our moments...Besides being 15,&nbsp;I also&nbsp;live in Portville (&nbsp;Saukville and&nbsp;Port Washington have a total population of&nbsp;around 15,000, right next to each other, and&nbsp;are pretty much co-dependent on each other,&nbsp; and&nbsp;I think it's incredibly moronic to be making 2 different&nbsp;towns, and thus, in my mind at least, Portville was born) My&nbsp;20 year old mother&nbsp;was in college when she had me and I'm pretty sure that's why she dropped out. I was born in Madison and then my no-longer-college-compatible mother went back to Portville and started to raise our family. I was a really weird kid, I used to do things that would make you think that maybe I should have gone in to see a psychologist. For example, when other boys were buying their hot wheels, I was too.....but instead of driving them around the kitchen floor or making noises with them, I would line them up along the house and tell everyone not to touch them. If they did I would spaz out and be upset. Something else I recently found out is that I used to only color the faces of the people in my coloring books. Nothing else. I wonder if there's some kind of deeper meaning to that? Well anyways, My mom had her second child when I was 3, which would make her somewhere around 22 or 23. Her name is Samantha. From early on we never got along. We actually have footage of me pushing her over when she's trying to walk in her earliest years. To this day I can't look at her without feeling a pit of anger and deep resentment towards her. I don't know why, it's just something about her. I occassionally feel bad about it, but nothing that lasts more than a few minutes. I think it's her suttle manipulative ways that help her get what she wants out of people, very vulturesque. But back to my childhood. We moved around a couple times when I was little, just to different locations in Portville. Not leaving the safe haven my mother came to recognize as home and associate with comfort and security. When I was 4 I met Chris. I still remember the day. I was playing in the sandbox and he came over and asked me if I would be his friend. I said "Sure" and history was made. I still hang out with him to this day. 2 more years passed and it's all a blur of day to day living and nothing really exciting happening. Then my parents divorced when I was 6. I don't really know why, I have some flashes of memories of screams in a lit room with a dark door by some stairs every now and then. I don't know what happened in there, or even if the place existed. But if it did, I'm positive it had something to do with the split. So after the divorce was final we wound up with my mother. My father got visitation rights and we used to go to his camp ground and visit. Eventually we stopped. No explanations. Another year went on and at the end of that the Cards stopped coming, and I didn't really care. I guess that's extremely cold of a 7 year old boy with no father to not care, but I never really asked questions or wondered what happened. I think I was just that ignorant to the world. But then my mom found her old high-school sweetheart and they dated for a while. Eventually it wound up with us moving to florida when I was 8. His name is Steve, and he's cool. He didn't know what the hell to do with 2 kids, but did pretty good neways. He had a decent place down in Florida, not the best location, but it was a good home. We lived in what people here call "The Ghetto" which is funny because most of them haven't even seen one. It isn't as bad as everyone thinks it is. I mean I got out of there alive and hardly disfigured, and this is.....well....me! Sorry, ADD kicked in again, lol. Well yeah, we had some good times in Florida. I was a lot tanner then than I am now. The first year I lived there I went to the school I was SUPPOSED to be going to. It may have been a bit rough around the edges, but I liked it more than the school the Rentals (Parents) made me go to the years that followed. I went from the Golden Ghetto to Preppy City. Did NOT fit in at all. I didn't know how to interact with those rich friggin uptight over-opinionated pricks. But I tried to make the best out of it, made a few friends. But my friends that I liked the most were back in the ghetto. I hung out with a few kids, Junior, Weasel, William, Tevin, Nacho, Mark, Carlos, Kalvin. They were all alright, Junior lived down the street and his realy name was Santiago, He was a little tempered and laughed a lot.&nbsp;Weasel was my neighbor, and the fastest kid I have ever seen in my life. He could keep up with the cars going down our road and he was only 9 or so. I bet he's a top athlete wherever he is by now. William was his brother and he was a fat load, stuttered a bit too. I never really liked him, and I got the feeling no one else did either. He was Weasels brother, so that's why we hung with him. Tevin was just some kid on the other side of the block. I went over to his house a couple times, but i never really knew him. Mark was a kid who was entirely too overweight to be in good health. Red hair and lots of freckles, he got a lot of pokes and jabs about his weight. And I still remember one time when he snapped and tried to kill all of us, he grabbed a pitchfork and was swearing at us and chasing us down the street. I still was a wise-ass and yelled "HE WANTS HIS CHICKEN NUGGETS BAAAACK" We ran for a little bit and eventually he fell behind and disappeared. We didn't really see much of him after that day. Nacho was Juniors brother, and he was older, He was a inspiration to me and my gaming progress. He was a little bit better than me in a few games, and that drove me to better myself. Having been a avid gamer for as long as I can remember, it was nice to find someone who was better than me in something. Carlos and I never really talked, he was more of Nacho's friend. Eventually my mother forbade me to hang out with them, fearing I would give in to bad influences and the lifestyle,&nbsp;and not trusting my decision making. On account of that, I lost all of those guys as my friends. Then I started hanging out with the kid across the street, his name is Joey. He and I became good friends. He is 2 years older than me, but we didn't really care. So we hung out a lot and eventually Joey's mom became good friends with my mother, and Joey's sister became good friends with my sister. Funny how that keeps working out....but he was my best friend for as long as I lived in Florida. My mom married Steve sometime in those Florida years and they had Zoe. Zoe is the coolest kid I have ever seen in my life. She's so smart and funny and fun. She's like the sister I should have had. She's a true Floridian, born in Florida, she can brag about that for the rest of her life. lol. I can tell she's destined for the elite and select few on the top of the social ladder that our schooling systems currently turn a blind eye to. I'm not sure that this is a good thing or not. Knowing how the popular women wind up. But she can do whatever she wants, she had the opporturnity, and the ability. Well after living in Florida for a little while longer, the Rentals decided to move back to Portville. It was around that last year in Florida that Joey's mom developed breast cancer. It hit him pretty hard and he was upset. I was there to help him through it while I was there, and I'm happy I was able to do that at least. Once we moved to Wisconsin I started to make new friends and lost contact with Joey, but I did call a couple of times, including when his mom died. I always feel crappy whenever I think about how we just kind of lost touch. But if I did call him I don't know what I would say. "Hey Joe! I'm sorry for being a complete ass and going back on my word to call all the time. But what's up with you?" I know that eventually I paths will cross again, but until that day I'm just going to have to get over it. Once we moved back here, like I said, I started to make new friends. Brandon was the first one to open up most to me. He kind of showed me the ropes and helped me navigate and get everything settled and introduced me to his friends. I still hung out with Brandon, and to this day I still do, but not on a daily basis. The people he introduced me to that I actually began to hang with are CJ and Travis. Of course I knew a lot more people than just those 3, but I didn't really get to be good friends with them as much. CJ is a huge guy, now about 6ft 5, and about 250, not really that overweight, just big. He's got a great sense of humor. Travis is about 5ft 10 and weighs around 140 and same characteristic traits as CJ, I don't really know how to explain who they are. To me they're just there, CJ and Trav. Well don't think theres no women in this bio. Yes we started to hang out with Lindsay, Ashley, and Stevie. Lindsay was someone who I could relate to at first, she was nice, funny, and just all around a good person. We even went out for like half a day, but I don't even know why we bothered. Ashley and I were never close, she was more of a package deal with Stevie, to be honest Ashley looks a little bit like a rabbit. Right now she's going out with Travis, and I couldn't be happier for him. I don't even know how to explain Stevie. As soon as I saw her I felt something, I didn't know what it was, but later I would come to feel that same thing every second. Only amazingly intensified. I would later find out it was love. I asked her out a week after knowing her, and got shot down horribly. She just never felt the way I did about her.&nbsp;Thats when I realized that love is a bitch. I still loved her....more even. It was with every passing day that I just kept feeling stronger about her.&nbsp;Then Ryan moved here. He is a alright guy sometimes now,&nbsp;and I when I first met&nbsp;him I liked him. He was cool to hang with. But eventually I started to H-A-T-E him. For some reason he had this unexplainable power over the women in our old group. Which then consisted of CJ, Travis, Me, Brandon, Stevie, Ashley, and Lindsay. We would go do things like bowling and movies and hang at peoples houses. Just having fun. But they all started to like Ryan, and no other woman in the school would ever consider him a possibility....at least none of the self respecting women. But eventually Stevie liked him. And he would constantly deny it, and I tried to believe him. He would always flirt with her on the phone for hours and whenever we went to the movies him and her would be flirting and hand holding and it was the small things like that, the things that I wished I could do with Stevie for as long as I could remember, that made me feel like someone had punched me in the stomache and taken a piss on my heart. Everytime they did their thing.But I think that's what started the sudden hatred of Ryan. And right before I started to hate him, I had a dream. Ohhhhh boy, this one involved me and stevie and something slightly sexual, and I told Brandon and he told the women. That got me in sooo much trouble. It freaked them out about me and made them cast me into the "creepy" categories to them. Needless to say that pissed me off and it kind of ruined my chances with Stevie....ever. And right then, that pissed me off beyond belief. Having lost almost all hope, and deciding that I'd rather not watch Ryan and Stevie be all over each other, I left the group. CJ and Trav came with me, they had their own reasons. And as months went by we hung out and had fun, enjoying each others company and laughing. The reasons CJ and Trav left have to do with the women, rather than the guys in the old group. So they still kept in contact with Brandon and Ryan. Eventually I kind of forgave Brandon. Even though, secretly, to this day it still pisses me off. And since I was in desperate attempt to get over stevie, I decided to try and salvage a friendship with Ryan. Now we hang out occassionally, and that includes the women. I still think they're always going to remember that, and will never look at me the same, but I'm over it now. After the whole stevie thing, me and Cory kind of had a thing. We liked each other but never went out. It's mainly because I asked her to a dance and she rejected me, so I went to the dance with someone else and apparently she wanted to see me there, so that thing ended....kind of. Me and her have become really good friends. We can tell each other things that we can't really tell other people. And we have this unlimited flirt thing that is pretty fun. But sometimes we both get scared that we might like each other. She's going out with James, and to be honest, I wish she wasn't. Not because I might like her, but because James is not the right kind of guy for her. He's a player. He's already gotten her to do thing that the old Cory would never have done. I just feel sad when I think about them and how he's going to break her heart. And what he might convince her to do. I just worry about her, I don't want to see her get hurt. She's heard all of these things from other people but it's the truth. We all care about her, and we all don't want her to be manipulated or coaxed into anything she might later regret. She says she's just trying out a different type of guy, but I don't know if it's worth the pain she's going to go through....Now there's Nikki. The one I was talking about earlier. She's Lindsay's cousin and I met her because her and Trav kind of had a thing, but he screwed her over to go out with ashley. And I started to like her. And she started to like me. We have been dating for a while and things have been looking pretty good, that a relationship was eventually going to happen. But then, as you know, I screwed things up. I don't know if things are going to be OK between us, but I wish more than anything that they will be. And I wish more than anything that they wont be. She deserves better than me, and I think she knows it. I don't want to hurt her. But anyways. My mom and Dad are fighting a lot more than they used to, not a good sign. My dad is going through a depression right now, or at least he was. He's getting better than he used to be, but still not in good condition. (When I say Dad I mean my stepfather, I call him that now) He gets a little tipsy sometimes, and a while ago he punched a hole in the TV screen. Our big screen, TV screen. Pissed me off, but I got over it. I got a big TV in my room neways, so I was good. He got a DUI, but the driving restrictions have to be over pretty soon. Now Zoe is 3 years old, and Sam is 12 I think. That's pretty much all I have to say about my life, and my family. I think I'm going to be entering more things in this blog site on a almost daily basis. Or at least I'm going to try to.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Alright, I don't know why I'm writing in this, No ones gonna see it, cuz I don't want to tell anyone.&nbsp;I think I just want to talk....or write....to something that is gonna listen and not think about how bad of a person I am. I totally and completely screwed up. With a capital "SCREWED" I dont even know why I did it. Yesterday was Fish day and I was supposed to call Nikki, and I didnt. I don't know why, but I didn't. I worked from 7am to 2pm, and I had a full 2 hours to call her on my break, but i didnt. then i got off of work at 6pm, and I still didnt. i wanted to call her, i tried to get myself to call her, but i couldnt. i dont know why. why the hell would i do this to myself??? i just wanted to be with her all day, and i wouldnt even let myself call her, and i had so many opportunities. now she doesnt even want to talk to me, and i dont blame her. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of myself and why i would do this. She's so great, and amazingly nice and always puts people in front of herself,&nbsp;and&nbsp;tons of other things that i&nbsp;cant get into because&nbsp;there isnt enough room on the internet,&nbsp;and i love to be around her and just wonder about how she can be all these things, and still like me.....at least i dont have to worry about this anymore, because she's never going to talk to me again, and i halfway hope she doesnt. for her sake. &nbsp; &nbsp; maybe ashley was right.

      Alright, I promise to  at least update this thing weekly. There's no way I'm going to just forget about this thing and quit. Besides that, A few things have happened. Well me, Trav, and Modder had a poker night a little while ago. I cleaned them out. I won 10 bucks. (not the biggest money but it was still fun.) I don't know if I've told you that I have a cousin in my school, her  name is Aly Fischer. Well Aly's friends has been talking about suicide. I told her the right thing to do, which is tell his parents about what he's been saying so that he can get whatever help he needs. I just hope she listens to me before something bad happens. But if worse comes to worse and he starts talking like that again and she tells me about it and doesn't call his parents, I will. On a lighter note: Dani likes me, Dani is one of Cory's friends. I don't think I'm going to act on it because of the stuff Cory has told me about Dani. She says she's easily bored, doesn't care about other peoples feelings, goes out with people just to  have fun without worrying about comittment. So those are pretty good reason to not like someone and I'll listen to Cory. She looks out for me and if she tells me someone is bad news, I'll listen. Well that's about it for now.

      Don't ask about the title, I couldn't think of one. (Not that you could anyways....and not that there really is a you.) I can't believe I forgot to mention this. I started football practice today by the way. I've been wanting to go out for football for the past year, so this year I'm gonna give it a try. Not that I'm totally unathletic, it's just I always played in parks or things like that, never actual organized football. I went to a Football Camp this summer, it was harder than today was so I'm not that worried about this conditioning week. Althought that does not under any circumstances mean that I'm not sore or that I'm not gonna feel this tomorrow. My natural laziness and sloth like habits that I've developed over the summer don't help any either. Waking up at 7:00 is going to be a pain. Practices are from 8:30 to 1:00, that's almost 5 hours for those of you who can't add. I wonder what the hours and days are when we start actual practice. I'm worried about those. I know I shouldn't be, but it's the whole peers watching me thing. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO CORY IN FOREVER. I think I'm going to just call her pretty soon. So later.

      HEY! I haven't entered anything for a long long time. Maybe this is how things are going to be, but it's all good. I don't see any need to enter in it daily. I left off with me going up to my great grandparents house to roof for the weekend. I went up there with my uncle and cousin and my dad, the ride took somewhere around 8 hours there and back. We got finished almost the entire roof the first day and it should have been easy to finish it all the day after. That didn't happen tho, everyone started lagging and slowing down the second day. My back was aching and I still can't full rotate my wrist without it hurting. I was shoveling and nailing and hammering and sweating the entire trip. The best part is the self-acknowledgement of a good days work given to you via the big pool of brown shower water at the bottom of the tub. I don't know if I told you this, but I got a job at Jimmy's. YAY!. I'm excited that I'm actually getting the opportunity to enter the working world and be taken seriously. Then again I'm nervous for all those same reasons. I've got to remember that this is something I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. Kind of seems like a prison sentence. Ah well, Get to look forward to that paycheck! Since then I've either been at someones house or working. My Mom and Dad got into a bit of a situation over the time I haven't enetered too. They were arguing as usual but this time my dad shoved my mom and she started bleeding from her elbow. She then called the cops on him and he took the breathalizer. Drunker than a irishman on St. Patricks Day. So he got taken away by the cops and can't enter the house for 72 hours. He's staying with Grandpa Wally for now. I don't know what's going to happen when the time runs out. Maybe they'll go to therapy and maybe they won't. If they wind up getting a divorce I know I get to pick which one of them I want to go with, and normally it'd be my dad, but I don't want to go with him if he's going to be drunk and not taking his depression medicine. But I don't want to go with my mom because if i do that means its final and i want to be with my dad. If I tell the judge I want to be with my mom until my dad recovers, my mom would have to be informed of this deal. I don't think she'd be too pleased with it either, most likely a lot of stares and glares and a angry vibe to go along with them. I just hope my dad recovers before this happens. I freaked out over my possible-liking of Cory. She was right there along with me to listen to me, but totally faithful to James. I'm letting her read my Blog right now, I trust her enough to let her read this. Ech! I wrote something about her and James that I didn't even remember and it was....definitely not the most encouraging piece of literature she's read. She says she's not mad at me, I'll listen to her. She's my lifesaver and my comfort when I'm in need, I need her a lot more than she needs me. (It's not a biassed opinion because she's reading my blog right now, it's the truth) I had a weird dream where I still liked ashley koller...only she had orange hair and lived in nikki's house.....which had tunnel in the floor that led to a island with cracks in the floor that led to the center of the earth and walls full of library books.....I think I went back upstairs and started talking to Ashley's parents, (which were nikki's parents) and they gave me a towel and said, "you left this here last night, its yours." (Then the dream ended.) Some other stuff happened in the past week, if I remember it, I'll tell you. Til' then. L83R
