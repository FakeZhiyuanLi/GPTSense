        I am in love with my Lord. The reason why I say this, because He first loved me. Even though I was the wretchiest girl, He still loved me. Despite my faults, He saw that I needed a Savior. I remember singing this song when I was young, "When my mother, my father forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. When I need some help, can't find nobody else, then the Lord will take me up." It's so comforting to know that God is there when you need Him.   Blessings!

      This has been a long week for me. This was the first full week back to work. I have been sick. I feel a whole lot better. God has been so good to me. I am alive and have  my health and strength.   My weekend was a strain at times. Satan has a way of trying to steal your joy. Well, he tried but failed tremedously. He even try to break up my spirit before Church this morning. Started praying and praising God. He had to go because God was in that place. I preached this morning on Romans 12:4 through the 15th. How there needs to be Unity in the Body of Christ and that we all had to work together. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit was present in that place, that people had to give him the Glory! I praise God for the ministry that my husband and I have downtown in Los Angeles. We pastor at the Harbor Light. Hallelujah! God is so Great!   So if you are ever in the area, stop on down at the Harbor Light. 809 East Fifth Street.     Blessings!

        Guess What! We having a boy and he's 14 years old! My brother in law is going to be living with us permanetly! God is so great! We have been praying about this. It is all working out! God is in control of the situation. He is a great kid, who's also smart!He's such a Blessing.    I'm feeling pretty good today. I was a little tired, but managed to make it through the day. I came hom around 4pm and took a nap. I really didn't want to wake up. My good friend Lourdes called and it was nice to hear her voice. I try to keep in touch with her, she's my classmate.

      Thanks Brother Julius for your comment.    I feel pretty good today. I am up and about. Yesterday I had preached, "What on earth are you doing here?" It was from Romans 12:1-9. It was pretty good, God was in the House! I have people praying for me, for my husband and I in St. Louis. It so great to know that people are standing in the Gap with you. My mom has been a great support to me. I love her with all my heart, because she is so strong. We are more closer than we ever been. I am so glad. I can't wait til they come in August. I am so so so so so so so so so so excited! Can't you tell!    Like I said in my past blog, the doctor said my blood tests are fine. I am very healthy. Wow! Praise God! The doctor will be working with us to figure out what exactly is going on. I know that God is in control! Amen!

        As I sit here today, I realize that I am blessed. It could have been worse, but I praise the Lord for every pain, setback, or thing that I am going through. I am blessed, and the reason why I am blessed, because I still have my health. Even though I have been through every blood test I could think of, I am still healthy. I have realize that the devil is at work. I will continue to praise the Lord! Though sickness may rack my body, I will praise the Lord! Hallelujah!    Interesting how the Lord allows things to happen. Part of me wants to give up, but I will not give the devil a foothole! Amen! Yet, I  don't see the miracle, it's there! My breakthrough is there! I will ever praise the Lord! I have to, that is the only I am going to get through this. No one exactly knows what I am going through, but that's okay. Because Scripture says, "The fervent prayer of the righteous availed much!" Amen!The Lord is my protector! God is so Great!

      Let Me Hear You Make Some Holy Ghost Noise!    Seems like when you are praying for a breakthrough, the devil gets busier. God is great! Came home yesterday with the stomach flu. So I'm pretty sure you know that takes a lot of trips to the restroom. I was not a happy camper! But God is Great! Besides other medical problems I am going through, God is Great! My husband has been so wonderful to me, waiting on me hand and foot. I could not have asked for a better husband. I love you, Victor Maurice Powell!    As a child of the King, I am determined that I will not give up! The devil wants to take my health, the future of childbearing, and every thing else.   "I can do all things through Christ, who gives me strength." Philippians 4:13   One of the things that keeps me going is knowing that I am in the Lord's favor. I was just reading how the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary. How he said, "greetings, you who are highly favored!" I believe that God has bestowed on me that same favor. So I am compelled to hang on to God's unchanging hand. I do believe that it is in God's timing. My breakthrough is on its way. Hallelujah!

      Today I went to the doctor. Did some blood work as usual. Seems like the devil always trying to push me off of God's path. No matter how much I tell the devil to leave me alone, he's always there.  But you know, that is okay. I'm still going to praise the Lord! Hey! The reason why I am going to praise the Lord even more! Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! I realize that God is in control and I can't. So I'm going to allow Him to Have His way! Have you ever notice when you think things are going okay, and then boom! The devil is there making his presence known. But I will not give in to the devil! I refuse to give him a foothole in my life. I realize it just makes my faith stronger. There is no need for me to question God. God will reveal it to me in His time. Eccelsicastics (mispelled) talks about that there is a time for every thing. There is, a time to be born, a time die and so on. Victor and I are praying for children some day. I come to realize that it's all in God's timing. My mom wants grandchildren, it's funny! She'll make a great grandma. Well, I shall go now.   Rejoice in the Lord and again I will say rejoice. Philippians 4:4  Leslie Powell

      Lord, Take the Shackles off my feet so I can dance. I just want to praise you.   Still not quite feeling well. But I going to wade through the storm. Sometimes I feel like the ministry can be so stressful. I realize that if I don't put my priorities in order, I could be so involved in the ministry that I don't time for myself, my family. Family is important to me, deeply. Sometimes a month of being busy or even two months, body tells me that it's time to rest. If I don't listen, then my health becomes a concern. My Granddaddie told me, "don't work too hard, you don't want to end up like me." He was young 39 years old, who had his first hard attack, seizer, and strokes. He pushed himself too hard and was sickly for the rest of his life. I definitely don't want to fall in that track. So I'm learning to take it easy, take care of myself.   So Lord, take the Shackles off my feet so I can dance. Lord, I desire imtimacy with you. Lord, let your presence consume so that Revival may begin in me. I love you, Lord.

      Today I am at home sick today. I don't like being sick. I've been dealing with some health problems. So any one that reads this, say a little pray for me. I definitely need it. I know that God is great and I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. I know that I can get through this. I am ready to surrender. Sometimes things happen to get your attention. I wonder if this is one of those times? We'll see. I'm going to lay down now, and rest.  Today is okay.

      I had a chance to visit family back South last August. I was so thrilled to see everyone again. Some faces had change, some not, some attitudes had change, some not. But it was all worth the visit to my birth place, the place where I grew up. My family and friends were proud of me that I had followed God's calling on my life. You know, I miss being home with my parents, I miss the fighting with my brothers and sisters. Well, not really, but the thought that we had our own way of communicating. Maybe this is way for me to express the different thoughts in my head. I look forward to input, but to let you know that everything must be in good taste. Blessings,

      I decided to to start blogging. I thought that this would be a great way to meet new people. Also a great way to find out about friends who loose contact with each other. But I realize that we all live our own lives.  But getting on:   God has been so good to me. The reason why I say that is because of God's faithfullness in my life. As I look back on my life, where God called me from and how I use to be, I'm Blessed. Today I realize that I have to be me. God has given each different Spiritual Gifts and talents. If we don't be obedient to the Holy Spirit, then we call the Holy Spirit a liar. That is something that I can't do. The Bible talks about quenching the Holy Spirit. I don't want to do that.   Continue to pray for my husband, Victor and I. We are a part of the Recovery Ministry, downtown on Hope Central, formally known as Skid Row. God has Blessed us to be a part of a wonderful ministry. i wouldn't have it any other way.
