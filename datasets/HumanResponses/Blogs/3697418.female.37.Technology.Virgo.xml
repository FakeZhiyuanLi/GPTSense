						    The Goddess is aware that the Yoni was created to recieve the Lingam, after all is that not the plan? Not necessarily EVERY time of course. but I deny nothing that transpires when in the moment. Nothing. Each meditative time of worship and peace is unique, with practice, levels of heightened awareness, and empowerment can be achieved in both the meditative state and during our more mundane daily events.  I initially came into being as a Tantrika under the  guidance of The Lovely and True Goddess *** ****** in Savannah,  Ga in 1989 . Having been initiated into (White) Tantric practices, I was hungry for more knowledge (a seemingly endless hunger with me) I then went to Maui with my Husband (since passed on) and attended two informative and inspiring (to us both) workshops with *&* **** (1992). (Red) More recently I have begun to study Bodywork (specifically Reiki and Trigger Point Therapy) with Ms. *** ******** right here in PA.  A well developed Methodologist who has a deft and gentle approach to all of life. I am Based in Pittsburgh , PA and have from time to time been known to "lurk" in The Tantric Temples here on the internet, I admire the more recent ladies that have been posting, and am frankly amazed at the power and the passion they bring to their practice. WOW. I most recently entertained another goddess and a special friend during their (both) initiation into red tantra. Their mutual comfort and attraction made it a bit easier than I forsaw and I was able to leave them to their practice after only a few hours of "hands on" direction. They called me the next day to report their mutual elevation into a blissful meditative trance, and to belie their initial discomfort and skepticism (we all experience skepicism it is only natural and right that as humans we question and even distrust the unknown.... . enough for now....

						   Walking through the park with you wednsday was really nice, how we were leaning towards and nudging into each other. It's funny, but that's one of the 3 times I remember us holding hands in public.  I guess I'm still not sure what you mean when you say you're still "figuring us out." You've been saying this as long as we've been together, and I wonder when, if ever, your emotions will resolve. I would hope that after spending a few years together you'd have more conviction about your feelings.  Funny how it seems like as time passes we get closer in a lot of ways, but on some level we get further apart. Is that because we want essentially different things from each other? Or is that because of fear? I'm not sure what you want or wanted from me, but when I'm feeling down I imagine that all you ever wanted was the promise of good sex on a regular basis.  What I want and have always wanted from you has been more that that. I want the promise of the potential for deep love and the possibility of a committed relationship. Of course, I never expected any of this from you right from the start. But I did expect your good intentions and an investment of time and emotion to figure out what we could have together.  I know this is the wrong thing to say, but I really need to know that you love me. If you truly don't know what you feel, then I need to get out of this now. I need to move on and find myself again , I need to live.  Cotton Candy Wishes, Me

						   Remorseless removal of emotional outbursts filled the daily grist of my morning mantra. A meaningless meaningfull realization of the neverending Blahs meditate? tantra? we will see

						   I have a tat, I love it, I got it for me.   I was just barely a teen when I came across a single daisy on the cover of a book (Sci Fi about Post Nuke America) it was beautiful, Now around the same time, I heard that rats, roaches, dandelions and daisies were 4 things that would survive a nuclear holocaust without having to mutate.(does anyone know if there is truth to this?? Nah never mind I prefer to have some fantasies propagated)  Over the years I have drawn that flower often, sometimes well, and others...well... LOL  when I was 31 I got one of the first drawings I had done inconspicuously put onto myself as a tattoo, For me it was an expression of my independence, and because I am a survivor.  I like my Tat , I drew it , they copied it meticulously and well, the colors are bright and the lines are delicate and clean , to me it is an artistic endeavor.......Mine.
