						   This is the Cliff's notes of the Reader's Digest version of the Patriot Act, as per the first hour of the Michael Medved show today (KLO 1430 AM, 1-4pm everyday).  What is the Patriot Act and what does it do, and how does it "erode our civil rights"? The Patriot Act allows the law to treat suspected terrorists in the same way suspected drug dealers and traffickers are already treated. This means that they can be wiretapped, etc. In a nutshell, the Patriot Act allows law enforcement to track down terrorists with the same aggressiveness and the same law as  the law that already exists  for drug dealers. Sorry for sounding redundant there.  Michael then asked the caller which she was more afraid of, terrorists or drug dealers? If you chose terrorists, you like the Patriot Act. A sincere "thank you" to John Ashcroft, for making this country safer.  If someone is worried about the Patriot Act taking away their rights, simply ask them, "which rights are the Patriot Act jeopardizing?" Also, ask them to cite even one case in law in which the Patriot Act was used to unjustly prosecute someone. Enjoy the stumbling and backpedaling that ensues.

						   George W. Bush will take Utah in the Presidential election on November 2nd, 2004. In today's Deseret News, a poll indicates that President Bush will garner about 63 percent of Utahns' votes. But that's not enough. I don't want John F. Kerry to lose in Utah. I want him to be crushed by Utah. Humiliation is the goal. Actually, the first goal is to show the President Utah's unequalled support for him. Kerry's humiliation is just a bonus.  I see it happening like this: First, a little demonstration to generate a little publicity, with some custom signs. Then maybe a small newspaper ad or radio spot (I have no idea how much that would cost) with a short description of our purpose and an encouragement to get out and vote, whatever. Let me know what your thoughts are on that. I think a good deal of Utahns don't vote because they believe the presidential election as well as many of the state-level elections are a foregone conclusion, and they're right, but it's important to vote regardless. Ask an Iraqi if that's true.  Another item of business, it might help to consolidate the SLC chapter with the University of Utah chapter, meaning everyone on the U of U roster should transfer membership to the SLC chapter. There aren't enough members to really justify or require two different, smaller chapters. Plus, the SLC chapter has a designated leader. I'll be making the change right now. Unless someone has their heart set on being the leader of the U of U chapter. If so, speak up. Otherwise, let's unite the chapters.

						   The many-chinned Michael Moore gives us  urlLink this  (thanks to  urlLink Timothy Perry ). Army Specialist Joe Roche writes:    Michael Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, is making the rounds here at U.S. bases in Kuwait. Some soldiers have received it already and are passing is around. The impact is devastating. Here we are, soldiers of the 1st Armored Division, just days from finally returning home after over a year serving in Iraq, and Moore's film is shocking and crushing soldiers, making them feel ashamed. Moore has abused the First Amendment and is hurting us worse than the enemy has. There are the young and impressionable soldiers, like those who joined the Army right out of high school. They aren't familiar w/ the college-type political debate environment, and they haven't been schooled in the full range of issues involved. They are vulnerable to being hurt by a vicious film like Moore's. I cannot sufficiently express my contempt for the omni-odious Michael Moore. Why do I hesitate -- Michael Moore is a traitor, perhaps the preeminant traitor in all our history.

						   This is the question posed by the Atkins-challenged Michael Moore to Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. Bill wouldn’t answer the question; Bill allowed that he would sacrifice his own life, but refused to answer the question directly.  Bill might have said, “Michael, I wouldn’t sacrifice my child if I knew that doing so would prevent a twenty megaton bomb from exploding in Manhattan. No parent would. I wouldn’t sacrifice my child for fighting forest fires in California; I wouldn’t sacrifice my child for the exploration of space; I would never willingly, knowingly sacrifice my child for any cause of any nature, however noble or worthwhile.  “But if my child were considering an honorable career with risk – a firefighter, an astronaut, a soldier – I would never stand in the way.”

						   On an  urlLink article on bloggers  (Oops! Sorry; web diarists) covering conventions for the first time, we have this (emphasis mine):  “I think that bloggers have put the issue of professionalism under attack," said Thomas McPhail, professor of media studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, who argues that journalists should be professionally credentialed. " They have no pretense to objectivity. They don't cover both sides. ”    Fair point. So is this: The NY Times has a pretense of objectivity, yet they don’t cover both sides, the slimy damn hypocrites. The NY Times is nervous over traditional media’s eroding news monopoly. They should be.

						    urlLink This seems like a great idea . It's a positive message, it's non-confrontational (except to terrorists), everybody wins. Count me in. There's plenty of time to prepare, scrounge up a few dollars for signage, Kinkos, whatever.

						   As Napoleon Dynamite might say, "friggin' sweet!" (I still need to see that movie...) In any event, welcome, new bloggers! Already some contributions. I like that! And if you just want to read, that's fine, too. Some of you are men of action, some are more the scholarly type. I'll try to post at least one item a day to keep the blog free of that not-so-fresh feeling, and I look forward to everyone else's thoughts as well.  Speaking of men of action, it appears that a kid in Cedar City has  urlLink launched his own protest , of sorts. Nice. Hey, it's a start. Good for him.  I have added a permanent link to the comic strip called "Day By Day", by a conservative guy, Chris Muir, who consistently nails it on the head without bashing your brains in. Maybe some of the liberal standbys like Gary Trudeau, et al, could learn something from Mr. Muir. But let's hope not.  In reference to the link to the Constitution, I must admit that until recently, I hadn't read the Constitution since High School. Pretty sad. But, you can always catch up. So I did. Good for me. I'd recommend that everybody read at least the amendments. It's really rather short, especially for a legal document.

						   I know what you’re thinking: Michael Moore, that fat f***. Stifle yourself.   Such nomenclature only lends credence to the notion that we neocons are an insensitive lot. And with some justification, in my view. I believe our cause would be better served by the substitution of more nuanced terms. Instead of  fat , use words like  corpulent  or  Rubenesque .   Dictionary.com may be of some help:  beefy, big, blimp, brawny, broad, bulging, bulky, bull, burly, butterball, chunky, corpulent, cow, distended, dumpy, elephantine, fleshy, gargantuan, gross, heavy, heavyset, hefty, husky, inflated, jelly-belly, lard, large, meaty, obese, oversize, paunchy, plump, plumpish, ponderous, porcine, portly, potbellied, pudgy, roly-poly, rotund, solid, stout, stubby, swollen, thickset, tubby, weighty, whale .   I can't believe they missed  bovine .   Example: Michael Moore is so dumb he couldn’t find his ample butt with both hands and a hunting dog.

						   I promised myself that I wouldn’t spend a lot of mental cycles on the Dem’s convention, but this was too good to pass up:   Jimmy Carter: “Let us not forget that the Soviets lost the Cold War because the American people combined the exercise of power with adherence to basic principles, based on sustained bipartisan support.”   Carter can’t quite choke out the words ‘America won the Cold War’; for the Dems, winning anything is  sooooo  déclassé. To win, one would have to be aggressive don’t cha know – a stance certainly unpleasant to our allies, annoying to our enemies and utterly inimical to Dem principles.   Carter stood firm: he would not win against inflation or stagnation; he did not defeat the ‘malaise’; he handed out countries like party favors to the Soviets (to be fair, Carter did manage a spirited defense against the  urlLink Killer Rabbit ).   If memory serves, America won the cold war because American voters had the sense to drop-kick that feckless fool out of the White House. We elected Ronald Reagan, who had a plan for defeating the Soviets, a plan that was universally derided and relentlessly opposed by the Dems.   The Dems officially abandoned any concept of winning a conflict in 1968. I didn’t.

						   Just want to be sure I've got this right: the  positive  spin is that Sandy Berger is such an incorrigible blunderbuss that he can be expected to innocently scatter Top Secret documents all over the landscape. Clinton: "We were all laughing about it.... People who don't know him might find it hard to believe...."   Well, Bill, you got that much right; it had crossed my mind that Sandy stuffing Top Secret documents in his boxers was somewhat indicative of nefarious intent. Wow, what a relief: our former National Security Advisor wasn’t criminal, just really stupid. I feel much better now.

						   Ted Rall a cartoonist, created a comic that contains a cartoon of Condoleezza Rice and some blatant racism, but there doesn't seem to be any outrage from the usual groups that express the outrage more times than not, such as the NAACP, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.  From FOXNEWS:    "Conservative African Americans are wondering why American minority groups are not as incensed by a racially inflammatory cartoon featuring  Condoleezza Rice  as they are about similar material featuring non-Republican targets."    The African American conservative group called Project 21, had to seek out the other minority groups and ASK them to express their outrage, because their wasn't any coming from them.  I think that's odd, because usually they express outrage over the most off the wall stretches of what they interpret as racism.  Such as that 300 pound black man who was high on PCP and attacking cops in Connecticut, who died from the beating he received by the officers trying to defend themselves.  But a comic that was published that refers to Condoleezza Rice as President Bush's "house nigga" didn't really seem to bother them that much.  The politics that get played, and the double standards disgust me.  Here's a link to the comic:  urlLink RIDICULOUS

						   I sent about 30 invites to this blog. If most of you join, it could quite easily be the blog with the largest membership on the internet. I don't know if that's a good thing or not, I've never done something that ambitious, blog-wise.  Just as a primer for those new to blogging: Blog entries are for substance, for adding news items or proposals for protests and such, not for things like "kewl site, d00d" or "send me Half-Life CDKEY plz". Feel free to send me an e-mail if you want me to add a link or change the background or the font size or whatever.  I'll act as the administrator for the blog and kind of monitor posts and keep it real, etc. I hope to see and read some good things. That said, I'll leave you with a photo that I got a kick out of:      John Kerry at the shooting range

						   Just a note to say that the blog is still active, though barely. I'd rather not do it alone. Maybe it'll gain some traction in time, or someone will come up with something better. In any case, there was some kind of rally yesterday on the Capitol steps about how voting machines are unreliable. Kind of a mini-protest. Some of the signage was pretty funny. One sign said something like "Believe the Chad" or "in Chad We Trust". They must have been counter-protesters.  The argument is that our current machines are unreliable and electronic machines, at a cost of around 28 million dollars, would take care of the problem. Wrong. It would be an insane waste of tax dollars. First of all, electronics and Senior Citizens don't mix well, as evidenced by a DVD I recently bought, a 4-pak of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton movies. The DVDs, obviously targeted to their original audience of now-old people, came with verbal instructions on how to use your DVD remote control, and how, at any time, you could return to the main menu if you wanted just by pressing the "title" button. My DVD remote doesn't have a "title" button. If I'm old, I just hit the wall as far as watching "Steamboat Bill, Jr." is concerned.  Am I concerned that old people won't be able to vote? Not really. I'm just illustrating that upgrading voting machines isn't going to help people vote. If a person can't master the skill of tracing the arrow to the hole and pushing the pin firmly in said hole, will the electronic voting machines help? No amount of money can help some people.
