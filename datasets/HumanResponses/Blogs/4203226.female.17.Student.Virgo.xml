      Man, I saw the men's 4 2000 m rowing today - it was incredible! Leslie, I don't think you could take it! We got silver medal, but (this is going to sound SO cheesy) to me it was a gold. (lol I'm killing myself laughing here cause I know how stupid it sounds!) But it's true - if you see the replay, we challenged the Brits so well - they'll be shakin' in their booties from now on! SCHINIAS, Greece (CP) - Rowing legend Matthew Pinsent won gold at a fourth consecutive Olympics on Saturday, with the British victory coming at the expense of Canada's world champion four in a thrilling photo finish.  The 33-year-old Pinsent, who wept while God Save the Queen was played during the medals ceremony, will doubtless be knighted for his achievements, as was fellow Brit Steven Redgrave with whom Pinsent rowed in the previous three Summer Games. Redgrave won five Olympic gold during his career.  Canadians Cam Baerg, Tom Herschmiller, Jake Wetzel and Barney Williams gave it their all and  lost  [ LOST! Got silver, you dolts! ]  by a scant 8-100ths of a second .   [ urlLink the full article  with pictures of the rowing team :o D  and the British rowing team - note the spiky haired Brit - he looks like one of the hobbitses!] Don McLean said that 8-100ths of a second is the equivalent to 8 flaps of a hummingbird's wing. EIGHT FLAPS! Man, I need a drink. OF ICED TEA, YOU FREAKS.

      Ok...I just wrote a blog and now its gone...oh well. Here i go again:  ANYWAYS...even though it was a totally pointless message I just wanted everyone to know what a letdown summer has been. I mean seriously, this is our last few months to just be high school students with no resposibilities and nothing to lose...this should be the time where we spend each day like we'll never see eachother again, making awesome memories that will start conversations with our new college friends.  This summer could have been fun besides the fact that there is absolutly NO sunshine ... no hot college guys visiting for the summer....which equals NO SUMMER FLING!! (cassandra n les) ...no spending money= because all $ is being spent on stuff like toothpaste, staplers, and towels...Its just not right!!! I think we should be taking this summer more seriously and really do something...i just don't know what. Thats for everyone else to think up of...Im just here to motivate...not to think!! seriously...  Ok well now im done...so Im going to stop...now... ;)

      So i finally watched the olympics today! yay beach volleyball! I have a question for everyone, except Leslie, cause i already know her awnser.  What bands does everyone have for frosh week?! Les gets Finger Eleven....*which i am o0o0ber jealous of*, and the Trews..and I get Billy Talent with Three Days Grace.  not that i am complaining because i super like Billy Talent, but Finger Eleven would have been sooo much better! Anyways yea..who does everyone else get was the original question before i started adding awnsers in there..hehe

      Girls are like apples on trees.  The best ones are at the top of the tree.  The boys don't want to reach for the good ones because they're afraid of falling and getting hurt.  Instead they just get the rotten apples that are on the ground, that aren't as good, but easy.  So the apples at the top think that there is something wrong with them, when in reality, they are amazing.  That is why we just have to be a little patient and the right boy, the one who takes a chance to find the good, right apple, will come someday...  This is true about all of you ;) and i found it in my saved e-mails bunch and couldn't resist on reminding you all.

      This is a completely meaningless message, just so u all know ahead of time what u are getting yourselves into. U see, i am very bored and noticed that i havent posted a B-LOG (haha, gets me everytime) in a very long time, at least 3 days! So here i am. But i do have good news! i had a little scare a few days ago over osap, it said i was only getting $5000 even though i was quoted 9, but thats all better now! which is good cuz i was totally freaking out about it cuz it would have drained all my savings for the first year! Um, what else is there...Oh! my dad STILL hasnt started my computer! grrr! yeah, but other then that, there isnt so much going on in the highly entertaining life that is mine (oh, i am a funny one aren't i?! lol) but that is all, if i forget anything you know i;ll be back ;)

      Well guys, one medal...so far. ONE. I mean and the one medal we have is a bronze...and it was in synchronized DIVING, it's not even a good sport to win in. ONE> ONE MEDAL! IN SYNCHRONIZED DIVING! The Canadian team is killing me here. I've invested like 48 hours into watching these olympics and NOTHING! It is mighty painful. I just hope we get another medal soon so i have something to go off of... something to keep me going...tear.  Les.

      Cassandra I thought of you first when I read this, and I'm sure Les you'll like it too because you're sappy like that. Apparently, some old war veterans were reunited by their mailman! The one  d00d addressed his letter to:      "Mr Adam Hastings, (Aged 70 years), Somewhere in Newcastle upon Tyne, Can a Kind Postman Help, Do Your Best For An Old Army Pal! (At One Time Lived At Benwell)."    and it got there! And now they're old pals again. Ha. The article is  urlLink here .

      Guys. I'm going to be spending  a lot  of money in the next few weeks. And by a lot of money I mean like over a $1 000. That's scary. I went to Ottawa today to see Jordan's new appartment and to check out some stuff @ BestBuy, namely  urlLink 4th Generation iPod  and computer stuff. I totally found a flat screen monitor for $299, which is super sweet cause that's not expensive at all for a flat screen, so guess who's all over that - yeah that's me! But bad news is is that they don't know when the 4th generation iPods are going to be in Canada. {dramatically looks out the window} haha. Yeah so I'll have to wait a bit for that one - so much for those long music-filled country road walks I was planning but didn't mention to you guys BECAUSE YOU'D SO LAUGH AT ME and try and discourage me from *GASP* exercise. You're mean (cough, Cassandra).  So this week TheMoney is getting transferred (woo that sounds like some crazy black market deal, no? And I don't know anything about your passport being missing, Leslie. Cough.) into my account this week so that means that the second it's in there, is the second I'M ALL OVER THAT COMPUTER I'M GETTING. All over it. Oh yeah and I bought a pot and a pan for $7 each.  Nice . And a bookbag for like $14. Beggars can't be choosers. Sortof.

      Well, everyone ready?  I'M NOT! haha..kidding.  It's Cassandra (hehe, Leslie), just wondering what's new with everyone...there hasn't been a new post in several hours and I am beginning to worry about the health of some of us (coughs, Jess).  Please, may I (we) suggest, that you do not do any more lengthy "instructions" type posts for a very long time.  Unless it has an instruction on how to (cough, cough), because you met your hot geek, please no lengthy posts Jess.  No important relevance to posts, should be banned from our "girls just wanna have fun" stress on the "fun" part.  Lol.   Kidding, but seriously no more technical crap....we all read the whole thing and by the end my eyes hurt...cries, and of course still oblivious to everything in the aforementioned post.  Anyways, i'm done blathering...this post is becoming very much like "instructions."  Byes!!!  Les.

      Ok, second round doing this, but thats ok! (grrrr....) So, where was I? oh yes. We have a slight problem, you see, there are 7 members in this here B-LOG (haha jess) , yet our description states that we are only 6...so i was thinking to myself "who here does not belong!?" haha, no, but we should fix it I think. It makes people feel unloved!

      Ok - You guys have it easy because they just changed how you can write an entry - it looks like a normal Word word processor, but it used to be that you had to go  like this  if you wanted the words  like this  to be bold. anyways, you don't have to worry about that until comments.  So if you want to post a picture like i did of my rez room, click on the picture icon (second from the left) on list in the Create New Post area. A little box will pop up and say  Choose A File To Upload:  -You browse and find the file Upload Path: type "/images/" (without the quotes - just type what's inside the quotes) and then rename the file if you want - but don't do this unless you remember to keep the .jpg or the .gif at the end - or else it wont work.  ok then it will go "uploading" and it will ask you to do an inline photo or a link to the photo. Inline is like what my rez room picture is. the link is just where you have "some text" and the words "some text" have a link to the picture which is just the picture all by it's lonesome on a page. (Does this even make any sense??)  If you want to make your comments  Bold , or  Italics , you have to put:      bold:   ‹strong› whatever you want to type‹/strong ›  (YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO DO THE BACKSLASH - / - before the strong at the end. that's what closes the tag - or else everything else on the page will be Bold.)       italics:         ‹em›whatever‹em›  - again, you have to put the / before the em at the end of the tag, to close the tag.        Also, if you're quoting someone/something, there's a funtion called the blockquote that you can use. What it does is it indents the text and makes it look a bit different, so the people reading will be able to tell the difference. (I used the blockquote function on this paragraph.) This is what the " button is. So you just type type type and the highlight what you want to be in the blockquote, and press the " button and it will go indented. you can do it before you write too, but it's a pain in the butt to get out of the blockquote format when you're done. Hope this all makes sense! Also, right under the box where you do your typing is where you can choose whether you can allow people to comment or not on your post. If you don't want to let them comment click No. Beside that you can change what the time of the post says - if, say, it took you an hour to ACTUALLY finish typing the whole thing. Or you can forward post - so i type this at 11:34 a.m. and i don't want it to show up until 5:30 the next day, I type in 5:30 August 15th and that's when it'll show up. You can also Save your writing as a draft and continue writing it later.  So have lots of fun with it - and if you want anything edited, just e-mail/IM me. I'd give you guys the Admin abilities, but I don't want you to accidentally delete it or change any of the important stuff on it - not saying you  would  or anything. :op

      I just want to let you all know how cool Jess is. First she has this blog idea (and let me tell you - it's really funny to hear you guys say the word "blog" because it sounds so forced. It's like "Jess, that B-LOG thing is a good idea!) Oh right. So I guess I just gave myself away. I finally hooked Julie up with this account - she couldn't figure it out (or it wasn't working or something). So I got it going, and Jule, you'll have to change your password or I'll be able to get in here whenever I want ;o)

(My mom was going to Oshawa so she brought down some of my stuff) I mean, my room is now free of all the good trinket stuff, and some of my clothes, shoes....my fridge, that sort of stuff, ahs already made the journey that is still ahead of me. Let me tell you, packing up the car is a sad thing to do...anywaz, i just thought i would share.

      Ok so you all know that I'm rooming with Olivia, right? And we have a double economy room because it's  that much cheaper  (like $1 000 cheaper). WE always knew that there were bunk beds in the room, but it never occurred to us how the floor plan would look like. Then Olivia came up with this really good - space economical way of dealing with the whole 2 people in the room-bunk bed thing. Have loft beds with the desks underneath. Pretty neat, right? Yeah well it would be  if that were the case!  But it isn't. The following is a picture of what our room is going to look like. Excuse me while I develop claustrophobia.

      So i called residence today, and i don't get to find out who my room-mate is until we move in!?! what kind of stupid school system is that!?(obviously) My dad [is having] the whole   "lets bond"   and   "i'm sad that you're moving"   thing today.  It was soo cute, yet in a very annoying   'you're acting like mom'   kind of way. and besides that today, john is going O0o0ber emotional on me.  Thats my job! not his! lol He asked me how much i really like him, because i seem uninterested lately, and he wants to know cause he wants it to work out. And i  !SUPER!  like him, its the whole mushy, i wanna try a long distance relationship feeling with him... but still...He shouldn't be getting emotional. Like I told Cassandra .."a boy who needs more  attention  than me...just not good...hehe"  ok anyways, enough of me whining, again, but i love it cause this way everyone gets to hear it! lol

      Well guys,  I just thought it would be appropriate to add to this message board the very beginning of our 2004 University experience.  Krystal's leaving for Durham first and earliest as an R.A...Jess and Julie go to Queen's, Cassandra goes to Guelph, Mel goes to Loyalist, Britta is going to Algonquin and i am going the farthest all the way out to St FX in Nova Scotia (yay, i make up the second province).   First and foremost, packing.  Who knew that anyone actually needs as much as they do?  I mean i went school supplies shopping and god!  you have to get the stapler and scissors you always steal from the kitchen when working on a project, you have to buy a stupid three whole puncher because you know that you'll be completely screwed without it.   Also, you begin to stock up on candy (well, me)...because you never know if you'll be able to get it...little town.  I mean seriously!  My candy stash now has poprocks (currently popping), fun dips, dubble bubble, endless amounts of gummy worms, gobstoppers, i'm going to get fat i swear.  People should be warned, i mean.   Clothes: what is appropriate now?  Why do you feel the need to actually go out and buy new comfy clothes when you know you're going to invest into like five more sweater/pant sets with your new school logo on it.   Technology: computer, tv, dvd player, phone...it's crazy!!!  First year is spent on stuff you use at home, but can't take with you...it hurts to think about.   But guys, seriously.  I'm getting nervous...i will forget stuff, i will need stuff...it'll be an endless disappointing circle in the coming few weeks.  I am also getting nervous to go.  It acutally is quite far, and it is a little intimidating in case i do happen to forget stuff.  I'm more scared to lose all you guys though, that's why we have to keep in touch.  We have to make new friends, as scary as it might sound.  Just when our circle is tight and close, we have to go form a new one.  Anyways, there's goes my intro to university packing...who knew it would be so lengthy!  lol.  Les.

      ok, the site's up as you can see - but the new template looks pretty crappy. I agreed on it too, but it just doesn't look as nice as the sample. So here are the other links to the other sample templates, and maybe we can all agree on one that's not stupid looking ;o)        urlLink Star one          urlLink other one like star one       urlLink the one that reminds me of apples       urlLink the scripty one  (ooh it looks all letter like)      urlLink pinkish funky one       urlLink bluish funky one       urlLink "tequila" funky one       urlLink greeny one       urlLink blue version of "greeny one"       urlLink original one       urlLink original one in blue     Soooooooo pick one, and just tell me which one you want in the comments. PLEASE NOT THIS ONE! And anyways, this one isn't an option! It's cute, but just looks ugly. Hopefully later I can find one that we all like that's free. We can pay to get them done, but like - who has money to waste on this sort of thing, cause I sure don't!

      This is just a test. Sort of. I figure this would be an easy way to keep in touch - just type a story or something every once in a while and  voila , we're all informed. The best part is, we can all comment however much we want. We can pretty much do whatever we want with this thing - show pictures, link places - it's all good. I don't know whether or not you will like this idea, but it's worth the try!  How it works is each post will be shown separately and will be tagged by the person who wrote it, so it'll go "posted by krystal at X:00" or whatever and stuff.... if that makes sense!
