      One shock keeps following the next. I imagined that both of the girls really liked me, and Misa told me again that her niece was terribly excited and always kept saying that I was such a cool guy. So far so good. But the clue is that the niece in fact has a boyfriend and rejected my e-mail-address because she is afraid of her boyfriend. But then why did she want to talk to me all the time on Monday, saying that she wants to have fun with me in Japan and asking if I had a girlfriend and if I am willing to make one in Japan???!!!... I'm terribly confused. But furthermore Misa also chatted with some guy about 6 (!) hours always telling me that she doesn't have time now... Why do girl always keep playing with me? But well, who cares - now it's my turn to fool women. I will try to no longer be the sweet and faithful guy and will try to still make them believe that I am. Well, this might be hard work, but... it's my turn to strike back.

      When I was chatting with the girl I mentioned in the post before, she asked me if I'd like to see her niece once. I thought "okay, this girl will be maybe around 8 to 12 years" and told her, I'd like to meet/see her once. But another surprise was awaiting me: it was a beautiful girl with the age of 20! We chatted all day (around 4-5 hours) even though in Japan it was already early morning. And this chat was really embarrassing but at the same time my self-confidence rose because both girls always said "kakkoii" or "kawaii". Damn, I don't know what I would do, if I had to choose - I really like Misa and despite her age she is sooooo sweet and beautiful... and her niece is sweet and beautiful too, but I don't know her well yet... Oh my, my life is getting more complicated - I like that ;-) until now, my life has been rather boring, so from now on it's time to live ^^

      Yesterday I chatted almost all day and tried to write some of the pages still missing in my report about the "edo-jidai". I went to my favourite chat "Sapporo-Chat" and met up with the girl I quite like from chatting before. We did some video-chatting by msn and it was really fun - we were talking about spending a lot of time together, when we meet in Osaka or Kyoto. Well, she is a really sweet and good-looking person! At the end of the chat, well, I asked for her age and really got surprised: she told me that she was 31 years old, once married. Wow, that was something - I thought she was around my age, maybe 2 or 3 years older. But I would not call this an disadvantage, maybe if we keep a good contact and enjoy ourselves together I'll give it a try and start an relationship with her. Right now, I don't know yet. I think it will all be decided when we meet for the first time. I'm really looking forward to it!

      Today I got a mail from a person working for the same company as my ex-girlfriend and dumb me thought it might be a "real" mail - lucky I didn't open the attached file: it's a virus which my PC got infected by about two days ago. Well from now on I'll do a little bit of chatting...
