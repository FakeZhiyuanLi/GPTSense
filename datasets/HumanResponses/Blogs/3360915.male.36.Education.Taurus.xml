						   In my school today a new student arrived. He came by himself; no-one escorted him in. Puzzled, cautious, with two big black eyes he was exploring his new space. The management had not informed us, the teachers, of the new enrolment. I approached and asked him some basic questions. His age placed him eventually in my class. Later in the class I had to fill in the register. He was Greek, his father was Greek but he had recently moved to London from Cairo, Egypt. For an émigré offspring his Greek was excellent. I asked his mother's name in order to fill my draft report. He looked around and declined to tell me. If you can't say it in Greek you can spell it in English I insisted. He leaned towards me, like telling a secret and wispered to me that she was neither Greek nor English and that she wasn't with the daddy any more. Just forget it, he said, don't put it in. Later I realised what was the cause of his anxiety. His mother was muslim. He was in a Greek-Orthodox Cristian School and he didn't want to be labelled as "the Muslim".   In the multicultural capital of Europe, in the eve of the 21st century, a 9 year-old boy was renouncing his own mother, conscious of the established prejudices of a society living in fear for the "other".  I remembered a friend, a teacher in Athens, that told me once of his Albanian-Muslim students who attend the Cristian-Orthodox Sunday School in order not to feel excluded from the main stream dominant culture.

						   I wonder, considering the neighbour voting habits so grafically exposed this year in the Eurovision song contest, wouldn't it more convenient next year to vote first and listen to the songs afterwards? An insanely large number of Europeans voted last Saturday for their favourite easily digestible song or should I say, their favourite neighbouring country. And yet, it seems so frustrating that in many European countries more people voted in that contest or for any of the Big Brothers or their musical TV cousins than in any local or general election which decides not the fate of the odd celebrity wannabe but their very personal own. I can see two counter arguments lurking here.  First that the tele-voting is so much easier than commuting to a polling station and second, a seemingly more serious one, that people have come to realise that choosing any of the main political contestants make no real difference what so ever. There are no clear ideological boundaries any more and everything is pre-decided in the higher circles of power. It doesn't matter who you vote for in the Agora since the Gods on the Olympus have set the path of our fate! Have they? Have they really? Look at George W Bush's days in office and think again.  As for the so called inconvenience of the real-voting I have only to speak about my personal experience as a kid. I remember the built up to the elections day; the debates, the expectations, the rallies and then, that very day, when I had to drive with my parents to the polling station, the tension, the guessing game of what party that person in the queue will vote for... and finally the fiddling through the ballot papers reading names of candidates in some coffee shop afterwards. And I remember that I couldn't wait to come of age to experience myself the feeling of silently voicing my preference to the full, completed inside the polling booth.  If a secure, fair and universal voting system that respects the voter's privacy is invented I might vote through a cell phone or my Mac for convenience. Yet, I am going to miss those colourful Sundays.
