      So I was setting my profile here at blogspot.com, and they ask you a question at the end of it. You can search through it until you find a question that suits you best. While I did my best to finally find a question that I liked. I had it all answered when low and behold I was over the max 150 character limit...which I thought at first wouldn't be hard to change until I try to do so.....anypoop to make a long story short I had to choose another question. BUT I of course save this one to share with you all. Enjoy!     You're trapped in a well with a goat and a slinky. Describe how you will escape.       I would milk the goat and make feta cheese. Then I would sit on the goat which I will name Ernest and play with the slinky. After I have made a lot of Feta cheese I would use it as a ladder and climb out and go sell my cheese....do you want to buy some?

        So have you ever been in a car that has run out of gas? Did you know that when you do the gas petal doesn't work....at all! Yesterday my best friend Meagan (we have been friends since grade 8 and we have had some crazy adventures with) and I had a super day hanging out. She was driving me home when she was like I have to get some gas but I will wait and get at the shell   right beside the  Tim's/Wendy's.  When she was like the car is running out of gas....Literally.  So   we coasted down the Hillsborough bridge towards charlottetown and would have made it to the shell but the light turned red so we had to stop. So we through on the 4 ways lights and laugh are asses off....then when the light turned red we laugh even more when RCMP drove by...and didn't stop. Oh well we only ran out of gas not like we were hurt. So Meg got some gas and we went on are way. The perfect ending to a great day...Thanks Meg, I had fun.

      Today is Friday the 6th of August I will be on vacation on the 8th. Both  urlLink Adam  and I have taken a week off and plan to travel the whole time, we are only sure that we are going to my 2 home towns of  urlLink Fredericton  (where I was born) and  urlLink Miramichi  (where my mom is from). After that we have no idea where we are going or what we are going to do, but there is one thing I am sure of  urlLink Adam  and I are going to have a blast!  I truly believe that you should have at least one week off either every few months or once a year. Everyone needs a break from life and have a good time doing what you love...Whether it is boozen, traveling, hanging with friends, or all 3 of those things you need time to get away from the work world and relax.  Anyways I just wanted to post one more time before I am on vacation, seeing how out of the last 8 days I have worked 7 and I have 2 more shifts before I go away. I just wanted to let you all know that I am here still.  See you in like a week or so (I would count on the so to being the real date I will be back at).

      So yesterday I went and got some of my immunization shoots, I have to go back this Friday and get more. I received my Td shoot which is to protect me from adult whooping cough, if you remember when you were in like grade 7 (or at least I was) you got a shoot for meningitis. The shoot that hurt your arm for like a day or so. And as I am typing I am getting tested for TB. It is this serum that they put just under your skin, which when they are inserting it makes your skin blow up like a bubble and then once the med goes in to your body it goes down in size. But is was pretty cool, the bubble came to a size just smaller then a dime and it looked like a big bug bite. Aren't needles fun!
