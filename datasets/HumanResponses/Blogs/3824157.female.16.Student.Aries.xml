          &nbsp;2day I've been thinkin bout...secret diaries. i don't have any. i used 2 but i was always afraid that someone could read it and find some  secret  stuff which they weren't supposed 2 know...    &nbsp;how'd u feel if someone reads ur diary? embarraced probably..........i'd feel that 2, i think.    &nbsp;there are those diaries with a lock and a pretty key (still  secret )that actually are useless...i mean, everyone is able to open it just using a pencil or a pen. they're ridiculous.    &nbsp;as i said b4, i don't have any diary but i have this blog. the main difference is that this is a online diary but it doesn't keep anything as real secrets, deep feelings about someone, all that stuff that you keep in a  secret  diary...this blog only keeps useless things...stuff that come to my mind...!    &nbsp;just to finish this....i think that a  secret  diary with a lock and a pretty key or a simple note book are equivalent. the grade of security is the same.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;WORD OF THE DAY --> Shoe.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah, just&nbsp;one.&nbsp;we can do a lot of things with a shoe...*thinks*..u can steal sand from the beach, u can throw it to someone's head...u can use it to kill someone if u have a bad smell on ur feet by putting the shoe really near that person's nose...!!i only use shoes to attack people...uh...ok, i also use them on my feetah ah ah, i'm amused thinkin what i'm able to do with both a shoe and a person which i don't like next to me...ah ah ah i'm malefic, as my brother says...!!&nbsp;and i'm so&nbsp;stupid 2...but that's another story.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; ***  take care  ***       &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Last night I had a nightmare with clowns…nope, not really, I was just kidding.  I'm listening to "Change" by Good Charlotte. Beautiful. This song doesn't mean anything in special for me but I know someone to who this song probably means something…  I'm kinda bored again.   My nick on Msn is kinda suggestive. "Spend ur LaZy…eNdLeSs…cRaZy days inside my bEd…oOpS, inside my hEaD!" It looks like I'm some kind of whore. Spend ur days inside my bed…yeah, it sounds bad. Maybe I should change my nick to another not so…u know. Lol…I only say shit. I must stop with this…right now.  WORD OF THE DAY --> Sticker.       Stickers are cool. u can put stickers on your wall if it's ugly or...u can just glue them to somebody's forehead...yeah, stickers are something kinda useless but they're cool....*sighs* i gotta stop with these things...my thoughts are always stuff like this...*hits head on the wall*  ***take care***

      remember the clowns subject? i think i'm not that bored to talk bout that now... i've been thinkin bout the meaning of the circus...not the word, that whole tent with red and white stripes (lol...like the band, white stripes....ok, forget), a box-office selling tickets to people always followed by their children (ok, not necessarily their children, happy children. noisy children. those kids go to the circus for what? i have to try to think as a child. hum....clowns of course!! i think almost all kids go to the circus to see clowns....almost all  like  clowns. i don't. actually, i really hate clowns. clowns are kinda scary with that perverse, wicked smile they wear. i was trying to get the essence of the circus or just get the essence of cotton candy and popcorn but all i can think of is that diabolic smile clowns wear so i'm gonna stop with this stupid subject before i start getting nightmares with clowns murdering my neighbourhood...   THE WORD OF THE DAY --> Bag.        it's really useful, especially for women. they keep everything they can inside their bags. wallet, perfume, lipstick, mobile, adress book (bc mobile is fuul of numbers...useful or not), pen, other pen in case of the ink of the first pen's over, tampons, glasses for reading, sunglasses, lost coins, lost rings, earrings or bracelets or all kind of that stuff, a little mirror, eyeliner, and so on and NO, this is not a travelling bag...it's just a women's bag! u want to know what men keep in their bags? hum...i don't know...probably they don't use any bag....   ***take care***   is it me or this post is kinda huge?

       i'm kinda bored....i've nothin to do...   i've been thinkin bout clowns. rich clowns and poor clowns. happy clowns and sad clowns. i know, it's kinda stupid...but i have stupid thoughts. i'll talk bout that later....i'm too bored 4 that now.   THE WORD OF THE DAY --> tv remote.     the best thing to don't do anything. u're in the sofa, and thanks to the remote u can do zapping without getting up...that's cool... but if u're on some kind of diet don't use the remote...get ur ass up and go change the channel on the tv!!     yeah...a remote is an useful object.  ***take care***

       Kazza came back 2 normal....uff..   thanks to kazaa i could get together all the songs from GC's 1st album...except "I Heard You"...damn song...grr.    yesterday i built my homepage on my home pc...on microsoft word, i don't think that thing's gonna work..if it does, cool.    i say the movie "jason" 2day...kinda cool...   WORD OF THE DAY --> Map.       Really useful. sometimes (most times) people don't want 2 use maps ans then they get lost perhaps in the middle of nowhere...their problem...whatever. it's useful...some people don't give the attention a map needs...that's all...lol    ***take care***

       Damn Kazaa....yeaterday i installed it on my pc and it worked well but now it's completely stupid...i have a lot of songs i took from Kazza yesterday but i want some more...*hits the computer*   WORD OF THE DAY---> Box.    A box is useful for lots of things like keep old magazines and old stuff we don't use anymore but we don't want 2 throw out...    we can also use a box to make something like a television...yeah, a television, not like real televisions but a cool television that doesn't transmits any program...ok, it's useless...  ***take care***
