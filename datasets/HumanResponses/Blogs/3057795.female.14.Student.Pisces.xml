      ....alam mo,minsan..id think if he's thinking of me too.......kasi ako ....lagi eh....minsan nga sobrang nababaliw na ako...i would check my cell every other minute to see if he would text...but no...nangangarap nanaman ako...dati kasi....halos everyday,we would text each other...in fact,laging puno inbox ko or kung di naman ay nauubusan ng load...pero ngayon????...MY INBOX IS EMPTY AT BUO PA LOAD KO.....you know,i read his journal again a while ago..it was dated march 10.. 2 days after he left.... 1:02 p.m.    " I'm in love... Been a while since I felt this way. Just hearing her voice makes me smile, her mere existence makes me go on. I know that somehow we would have to part ways but I won't let go, not now, now that I found what my heart beats for. ".....i have no idea if that entry was for me .......or HER......how i wish i knew...what makes me think that it's not for me?..well,mag-on na sila at that time eh..but my besty,whom i just spoke to a while ago told me that it really might be for me...she told me "  minsan may mga tao na mare-realize nalang nila na mahal nila yung tao kapag iniwanan na nila  "...can that really be true??...i have no idea..................i hope so....=(...ito pa..during that very same day, he had another entry..made just for me coz it had the..-08-........    1:05 p.m.    even if they steal my heart   they'd give it back   'coz they'll realize   it only beats for you    they could take me away   but it wouldn't matter   'coz whatever happens   I would always come back to you    they would never have me   'coz I don't want them to   I only want to be here   in your arms... it's true    -08-     2004-03-14 - 2:54 p.m    in thought you might say you have many rivals, but here in my heart you will always stay unrivalled...      2004-03-15 - 12:32 a.m.   You First Believed Lyrics     How many times did I pray  You'd find me  How many wishes on a star  Gazing off into the dark  Dreaming I'd see your face  Safe at home unafraid  Captured in your embrace   So many times  When my heart was broken  Visions of you  Would keep me strong  You were with me all along  Guiding my every step  You are all that I am  And I'll never forget   It was you who first believed  In all that I was made to be  It was you looking in my eyes  You held my hand  And showed me life  And I've never been the same  Since you first believed   There were times  When I'd thought I'd lost you  Fearing forever was a dream  But it wasn't what it seemed  Placing your hand in mine  You could see in the dark  You were guiding my heart   It was you who first believed  In all that I was made to be  It was you looking in my eyes  You held my hand  And you showed me life  And I've never been the same  Since you first believed   How many times did I pray  You'd find me  How many wishes on a star      2004-03-15 - 1:18 a.m.   [ Verse 1]  I brought you here so that i can express the things i've been thinkin bout give me your ear.  cuz i don't normally do this so bare with me through this. there are so many things that i  want to say. but let me start by saying this saying i thank you. darling just because..   [Chorus]  i used to love someone that i didn't like we used to want to break up every other night. i  used to think realationships were a lot of stress. i used to think that pain was a part of  happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way, but i don't want us to become  another used to be.   [Verse 2]  I hope what i'm saying don't discourage you in any kind of way cuz i do believe that you have  the potential to be everything i need. i hope that you can really understand that i would hate  to be with someone new, and tell them what i'm telling you.   [Chorus]  i used to love someone that i didn't like. we used to want to break up every other night. i  used to think realationships were a lot of stress. i used to think that pain was a part of  happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way, but i don't want us to become  another used to be.   [Verse 3]   cuz it would only be another waist of time and all the moment to be raised i would bout my  mind. another memory a part of history. I cant forget cuz it keeps haunting me. Now that your  here is evidently clear, but i don't ever have to have this worry again again. ooohhhooooooo.   [Chorus x3]  i used to love someone that i didn't like. we used to want to break up every other night. i  used to think realationships were a lot of stress.i used to think pain was a part of  happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way, but i don't want us to become  another used to be.      2004-03-16 - 10:02 a.m.    Moonlight   It was a day that I would never forget…   I was sitting by the window holding my guitar playing my heart out. It was then that I saw the girl walking alone under the moonlit streets. She looked at me but I looked away, I love someone else after all. So she went on walking. The next time I met her was at the local coffee shop, where I always stop by to buy a vanilla frapuccino. We talked awhile and went our separate ways thinking it would be the last time we would see each other. But I saw her again that night, but this time she was crying. So I went out and walked with her. She fell in love with someone she wasn’t supposed to, and she told me all I needed to know. So, she said it was better if we parted ways, because she knew I love someone else.   She passed by a week after and asked if I could be with her one last time. I couldn’t see anything wrong with that. So we walked and sat down under a lamppost. She held my hand so tight, and then she looked at me and walked away. I tried to go after her but I thought it was better if I didn’t. So I went home and went straight to bed.   I called her up, she was surprised to know it was I, and I told her something of mine was with her. She put down the phone. I sat down and the phone rang, it was she and told me, “I don’t think it’s with me but if I do find it I’ll return it to you as soon as possible.” “You don’t have to return it,” I replied. “I thought it’s important to you,” she said. Yes, Very. And we hung up the phone.   I thought I wasn’t going to see her again. But as I was sitting outside the coffee shop, she passed by. This was my chance, my only chance, maybe even my last, so I stood up and called to her.    “I think you have something of mine”  “What is it?”  I paused awhile and took a deep breath  “My heart”  …And we became silent  “You don’t have to give it back, it’s yours”   And she stopped and she looked at me and we kissed under the moonlight   -080-     ...but of course...this was back then.......ngayon?what's his entry... 10:41 p.m.  " I just realized that the feeling of wanting to be with someone the rest of your life IS true. Maybe because I only felt it now...with her ."  ....now this is definetely not me...but HER............mahal nya talaga siya no????????????i hate my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ganito ba talaga kasakit at kahirap magmahal?!?!?!?!?!?...*sigh*     Forgive Me Forgive my mind for it can't forget the day we met, The day my world turned upside down The day I finally said that my life had begun. Forgive my soul for all it can see was that we were meant to be for each other It doesn't see that we may never be. Forgive my feelings These feelings for you that I just couldn't kill Feelings that would take me back to yesterday Feelings that would recycle my hatred and make me love you all over again. Forgive my heart for all it wants is to love you still Even though it knows that you already belong to someone else     I LOVE YOU EVEN IF IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LOVING YOU ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUT I DONT THINK YOU'LL EVER SEE...YOU WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ME............DAMMIT!HOW CAN I MAKE YOU SEE?!?!?!?  ..... I KNOW THAT A MILLION WORDS WOULD NOT BRING YOU BACK..........BECAUSE IVE TRIED.......AND SO WILL A MILLION TEARS..............BECAUSE IVE CRIED...............AND I STILL DO EVERY SINGLE NIGHT..........  ......oh boy...di nananman ako makakatulog nito....haiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.........................=(

      I know that im not supposed to be writing to you now..but I just want to be honest with you…I promise this will be MY LAST…I know that I should have stopped like months ago,pero meron lang talaga akong gusto linawin..…kausap ko si che kanina…and we talked about you…….may sinabi sya sakin na sobrang nagpagulo ng isip ko lalo. Sbi nya na there was a point before na naiinis sya sakin dahil nasasaktan ka na daw bcoz of me…it was as if you thought and felt daw na binabale wala ko lang ikaw…parang daw bale wala lang sakin yung pagmamahal mo sa kin dati………and this daw might have been the reason why you left me……she said that this was the only time that I reacted to you…I was too late na daw…………………………Honestly, I have absolutely no idea why you thought that way….Think of it…. Would you think id talk about you to the whole class of 2-9 halos everyday kung binabale wala kita? Would you think id skip some class lectures just to find time to write you letters kung binabale wala kita? Would you think id txt you everyday to see how you are doing kung binabale wala kita? Would you think id pray for you every single night just so that you’ll be safe and so that God may help you in your problems kung binabale wala kita? Would you think papabayaan ko na inaaway ako ng ibang tao dahil sayo kung binabale wala lang kita? Would you think id try all I can just so that I could be whom you want me exactly to be kung binabale wala lang kita? Would you think id try all my might to keep us together kahit ayaw ng ibang tao king binabale wala kita? Would you think id say that I love you kung binabale wala lang kita??????? ………………………I can’t understand how you could not have seen that…… I for myself had even thought that maybe I was going to forward or something all bcoz you txted me before that you were not the kind of person who’d say “I love you” everyday…that’s the reason why there was a time na I started to “lay low” on the things I have been doing……….ang hirap mo mahalin…………………….sna maintindihan mo yung reason kung bakit lalo akong nahihirapan mag-“move on”…I could not see kc that ive done anything wrong……so don’t expect me to let go just right away bcoz it’s hard….and I know you know how hard it is because you’ve already experienced being left behind…………………………….IM TRYING MY BEST OK…it just takes time………… I did not write this letter to make you realize anything…..and I have no intention of getting you back …..like I said….may gusto lang ako linawin..yun lang talaga…..btw, I also want to say sorry dahil nagalit daw si louie sayo bcoz of me…kasalanan ko naman talaga….di na mauulit…ako na ang lalayo………pero sana lang kung mahal na mahal ka niya matuto siyang magtiwala sayo….dahil I am absolutely sure na wala ka talagang balak na balikan ako because you love her so much…you may not notice this but, i know that bcoz when I see both of you together………you seem to flash your most happiest and prettiest smile….......im happy for you pau……all I want right now is to wish the best for you………..stay happy with louie….:)  P.S. You don’t have to reply if you don’t want to…im not expecting you too..

       ...minsan talaga, i cant practically hide my feelings anymore..sometimes i would have to go to my room, confine myself and then burst out in tears..sometimes i would catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror..and by the looks of it ..i look ever so horrible..ever so unhappy..ever so hurt..  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *     DON’T READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Naiinis ako sa sarili ko kc everything that had happened today was a lie….i now what he was trying to do a while ago..he wanted to say that he was sorry…and I completely ruined it…argh!..@#?!%?.............................................during the first few weeks of last summer, I was angry at him..as in kinimkim ko talaga lahat ng galit ko sa kanya dahil nga dun sa sinabi (or tinext?) niya..i told myself that I had to forget him..i had to move on…I had to stop thinking about him…I was confident that I would be able to do this….but as weeks passed, I proved myself wrong….i don’t know how and why but it seemed that the more I tried to forget...the more  the memories came back….it is just so weird because, there is just something about this person that never makes me stop thinking about him…pero I was completely sure at that time that I had to do whatever it takes para makalimutan ko siya....kaya....ang inisip ko ay magkunwaring galit sa kanya para matatak ko sa isipan ko na di ko siya kilala …at dahil di ko siya kilala di ko rin siya kakausapin…SORRY talaga *a*!!!....sorry sa lahat….believe me..hirap ako gawin to kc ikaw talaga ang tanging taong di ko maaway…...pero ang reason ko lang para gawin to was para din na ako makahahadlang sa inyo ni L***e... i did this for you …ewan ko nga ba sayo kung bakit gusto mo pa mag-sorry sakin..ayaw mo ba nun????..wala nang magte-text sayo ng kung anu-anu...wala ka nang problema…wala na kayong proproblemahin ni L***e..WALA NA AKO....  ………..pero kahit ganito,,nasasaktan parin ako…dahil there’s still a part of me that belongs to you….there will always be…   but I know that I’ll be fine……just as long that I know you are HAPPY with her..  and by the looks of it I think you are.............................

      SAYANG NAMAN &nbsp; Di ko malimutan Ang mga sumpa sa akin na di iiwan Ako ay nagtiwala at sa yo ay naniwala Na ako lamang ang nasa buhay mo Tandang tanda ko pa Ng sabihin mo sa akin na ayaw mo na Ang mundo ko ay gumuho at ang luha’y biglang tumulo Ang mga pangarap ko’y naglaho &nbsp; No pa ba ang aking magagwa? Cguro nga di tayo para sa isa't isa... &nbsp; Sayang naman ang pag-ibig na ibinuhos ko say Sayang naman ang mga panahon na ginugol ko sayo Kung maibabalik ko lang ang ating nakaraan Di na sana dadating sa ganitong kalagayan Di ko matandaan Kung ano ang huli nating pag-aalitan  Saan ba ako nagkulang, ano ba ang kasalanan? At ikaw ay biglang lumisan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A GIRL CAN DREAM &nbsp; When I was a child the story would say Somebody will sweep you off your feet some day That’s what I hoped would happen with you More than you could know &nbsp; Iwanted to tell you that my heart’s in your hands I prayed for the day that I would get the chance And just when I worked up the courage to try Much to my surprise &nbsp; You had somebody else These feeling I kept to myself &nbsp; I may never get to hold you so tight I may never get to kiss you goodnight I may never get to look deep in your eyes Or so it seemsI always will be wishing you were mine I’ll think about what could be all the time All the happiness that I could find Baby, a girl can dream &nbsp; From the moment I wake up till I fall asleep I imagine you’re not with her but with me Talking and laughing sharing our dreams But it’s just a fantasy &nbsp; ‘Cause you have somebody else these feelings I kept to myself &nbsp; …a girl can dream it’s true and to call you my own it’s the sweetest dream I know &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GOODNIGHT&nbsp;BUT NOT GOODBYE &nbsp; When I look at your girl/boy, the stars come out And I no longer feel a doubt You're my reason why My strength to keep on trying A river in my heart that won't run dry &nbsp; This love is a wish you made come true I closed my eyes and dreamed That I'd find an angel just like you &nbsp; This love is a dream that came like clouds out of the blue Raindrops fill my eyes Goodnight but not goodbye &nbsp; When I think of how much you mean to me When you say I'm the world to youGirl/boy, it's infinite We'll never call it quits You and I are such a perfect fit &nbsp; This love is a wish you made come true I closed my eyes and dreamed That I'd find an angel just like you &nbsp; You're the best thing in my life And I'm gonna get it right I will be your shining knight 'cause you are my shining knight &nbsp; This love is a wish you made come trueI closed my eyes and dreamed That I'd find an angel just like you &nbsp; This love is a dream that came like clouds out of the blue Raindrops fill my eyes Goodnight but not goodbye
