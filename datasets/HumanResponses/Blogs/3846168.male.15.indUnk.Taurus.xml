      Well now I can tell you... The so called "Youth Barbecue" activity (as mentioned below) was really a going away party for our beloved Mexican, Steve Martinez. If you missed it sorry you couldn't come and say good-bye to Steve before he leaves for Tennesee. Yes, he's moving there in about 2 weeks so go hang with him! We will miss him greatly and it will never be the same without him. His personality brings humor and crazyness to us all! It just won't be the same, Steve. Be sure to visit!!!

      Hey, coming up this Friday is a youth get-together. We will be wakeboarding/skiing, inner-tubing I suppose, swimming and whatever! Just hanging out. Then we will go inside and eat dinner, which will be a barbecue. Veggie meat is provided but if you want to bring your own meat hotdogs/burgers feel free to bring your own. The part starts at 4pm at my cabin on Hayden lake. It will go until around 8 or 9pm. There is a surprise that you sureley don't want to miss. If you want to know it is, just email me! I can't say it on here...  Directions: From highway-95 turn east on Lancaster (if your heading towards Sandpoint on highway-95 then east will be on your right) and head east on Lancaster. Just follow this road... it will eventually turn into Hayden Lake Rd. Follow it for about 10 miles (a guess?). After you are a couple miles from Camp Mivoden you will see a road on your right called Chicken Point. Do not turn right on this road. Just continue along Hayden lake rd. until you come to the next road on your right. Take a right on this dirt road called Holmes Lane and follow it down the hill. The first driveway on the left is ours and you'll see the cabin.   If your coming by lake head for Camp Mivoden. If your facing the Camp, we are in the first bay on the left (right before the camp). It is a brown cabin with white trim and it has a small boathouse down on the lake. There's basically a sandbar sticking across this bay: we are at the tip of the sandbar (right behind it). For more info just email me at this address.  For more information email me at brendon.bauer@mac.com or call me at home.

      Well, I've been at the cabin all summer long - hanging out, working, playing etc. Not a lot happening out here... It's been really windy lately; the lake always seems rough. I think North Idaho skipped summer this year.  I saw King Arthur the other day and went to the Resort for Gooeys :D. I don't have much to say at the moment, as not much is happening.  For you contributors: Go ahead and post whatever you want! If your not a contributor and you would like to be one, email me using the link above!

      Last night I went to 2 movies: Spiderman 2 and The Day After Tomorrow. They were both pretty good in my opinion.   Spiderman 2 was much more action-packed then the first Spiderman. This is what made it better than the first. It had some drawbacks in my opinion (Women, you won't agree with me). It was full of romance and "Oh Spiderman" blaw blaw blaw. I guess it made it a good story - I'm no movie writer. I was dissapointed with some of the graphics as well as the part where helicopters were following spiderman. They didn't look real AND their movements were so fake... No science was involved :P. I will definately go see Spiderman 3 when it comes out; I'd hate to not know what happens in the end... It leaves you hanging at the very end where... ok I won't tell you. Go see it!   The Day After Tomorrow was great. It was full of action, spectacular graphics in my opinion, except for a few blurbs of the helicopters. Now, the whole science of the movie was a little unrealistic but it made a good movie. It had suspense to it most of the way through. I was in awe watching the cities be destroyed by tornatoes, hurricanes, storms, and much more!  Well that's about it for now. I have to run - the lake is smooth :)

      4th of July was yesterday, as your sure not to miss. I was up on top of the hill behind camp MiVoden watching 3 sets of fireworks: Hayden's, Coeur d'Alene Resorts and some other ones in the distance. I swear there wasn't a place in Coeur d'Alene that people weren't setting off fireworks. You could see explosions EVERYWHERE! Then on the way home we ran into some drunks lighting fireworks on the road... they were throwing them everywhere, heh. Last time I lit a smokejumper I burnt my hand and got a huge blister which hurt like heck. Anyways, I'm going out to wakeboard or something. Happy holidays! (Insert National Anthem here)
