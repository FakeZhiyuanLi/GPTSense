      It's official, I've fallen in love with my flip-floppy/sandal like shoes. So comfy. With the added bonus of keeping my toes nice and cool. Not to mention the best bit, I can see my toes wiggle! Yeah, I know it sounds odd, but toes are kind of cool aren't they? Or maybe I've just never grown past that stage (usually of little babies before they can walk) of thinking toes are just brilliant. I could watch them wiggle all day.  OK that's enough strangeness for one night, I'll move my disorganised packing off my bed and climb in. I'm kind of excited that this is my last proper night at home before leaving.

      Just returned from the middle of town, having done some more damage to the bank account. Things are coming together. Picked up some insect repellent (don't know whether it'll work on the ex!) and some sandals, although they're that funny style of cross between walking shoe and flip-flop.  Brought some clothes too. For the first time ever I didn't bother to try them on before buying, as the queue for the changing rooms was ridiculously long. Felt quite liberating just picking stuff off a rail and walking straight to the till! It is a funny world we live in.  I've just replied to some emails from some course mates who have already arrived in their elective destinations. They all sound very relaxed and chilled. All enjoying the sun too. Looking out of my window at the moment at the grey sky I feel a little jealous.  The new bookshop in the middle of town simply looked far too tempting this morning. So I attacked, emerging victorious albeit £21 poorer. I even picked up a copy of 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring' despite it looking like a chick book. At least I'll have something to read on the elective.   Today I feel calm and resigned about Toronto. I really know nothing about the girl we're staying with, apart from the ex saying she has plans to go out partying every night. That's fine and great with me, but the clubbing/drinking scene just isn't my cup of tea, so if they want to go then that's fine. I have a guide book to the city and I'm looking forward to exploring it. Being realistic about needing to spend sometime apart from the ex is I hope going to prevent too much irritation.

      Right it's Friday 30th May... It's getting closer.  On Monday I fly out to Toronto on my medical elective.  All sounds fine and good apart from the person I'm going with, an ex-boyfriend. Yep, 5 weeks with an ex is taking the 'lets be friends' business to a whole new level I think. I have that un-settling feeling that it could well turn into 5 weeks of exchanging thinly veiled insults and long silences. We are simply too different to get along in such close proximity as our friendship is normally buffered by not seeing each other for several weeks at a stretch.   And not to mention my patience. This morning the phone rang... I picked it up, "So you do answer phones in your house then?" was the first thing I heard. Maybe it was the sickeningly sarcastic tone, or he just caught me at a bad moment, but pure irritation rose its ugly head, and how I bit down a nasty reply I don't know. I was feeling exactly the same emotion as I did in the dying days of our relationship.   It's funny isn't it, I don't exactly remember the date we broke up, or what exactly was said. I just remember the irritation I felt at his behavior over the previous few weeks. It was that same irritation that made me feel so ridiculously relieved and even happy when we split up. He was no longer my concern, his personality was no longer going to grate against mine, and no longer try my patience.   I must have been out of my mind when I agreed to go on my elective with him.  Oh well, it's too late now to go back.  On the brighter side, my preparations are coming together nicely. Travel insurance is sorted. Currency exchanged. Rucksac waiting to be packed. Walking boots are nearly broken in.  A few more things need to be brought... Just insect repellent, shorts and shoes I think.

      Hello again!   Remember me?    No? OK it's my fault, I've left things too long. There was a whole 5 weeks of elective and, since getting back, the past week where I simply couldn't be bothered to write anything. But don't worry, a  HUGE  update is coming soon... here's a quick preview of a few topics it'll cover:  1.) A huge fashion faux pas - sandles with socks (I shudder to even think of it)  2.) An apparent world expert on influenza (Not nearly as exciting as it sounds)  3.) Memories of some real  chunky monkeys ! Well, what more can be expected in a nation with chairs in neurology sponsored by 'Burger King'. Not to mention Burger King branches in children's hospitals.  4.) Lots of driving on the wrong side of the road  5.) Some very warm, sunny weather  6.) Excellent site-seeing: San Fransisco, The Grand Canyon, Alcatraz, Yosemite National Park  7.) The incredible hotel room that stank of urine  And not forgetting (I know I can't):  8.) My amazing patience! How I avoided shouting at him I'll never know.

       Today was the first for ages when I've actually slept in until 10:00am. Usually I'll wake at my normal getting up time of 6:15am; or over these past few weekends I simply haven't had time for a lie in. So it was a promising start to the weekend.  Can't say I've actually achieved that much today. Just been floating around. My housemate who's moving out, went home today so it's just me in the house this evening.  Mum rang earlier this evening asking me if I could get to Stratford earlier tomorrow. She said she was feeling a little vulnerable and ganged-up on by Ann, which didn't suprise me much. She asked me to get there for 10:00am, certainly earlier than I'd planned! Oh well, we'll just have to see what time I wriggle out of bed at tomorrow morning.

      The end of the week is here already and I honestly haven't made much progress on the work front. My current dilema is whether to pull an all nighter to make up some lost time.  Today I sat through an endocrine clinic which was full of chunky monkeys. Then I had some really good teaching where I found myself wrestling with a wriggly 11 month old kid.Oh if ever I needed to know just how bizarre my course is...  Not much else happened today. Had Chinese for tea.  Just found myself glancing at Handbag.com and for a moment the question of who's going to be the next James Bond weighed heavily on my mind. If ever I needed proof that my brain is tired there it was.  Arranged the final details of going down to Stratford on Sunday morning with Mum too.

      I'm feeling a bit sick this evening. Today was another muggy day typical of Britain's lame attempts at a Summer's day. I think I got a little dehydrated, so in typical British style I quenched my thirst on tea (a diuretic) whilst wearing quite warm clothes all afternoon. Added to the mixture was my leaving my tea rather late. I’m not sure whether it was me going a little hypoglycaemic or just dehydrated but as I cooked my tea, my knees were a little jellified and my hands shaking with a fine tremor.  &nbsp;Medicine is great isn’t it? What other subject gives me the know-how to diagnose myself? &nbsp;I tucked into my tea and started to feel better. That was until I had to jump up to answer the phone, it was my brother, so I decided he could be spoken to from the safety of the floor.  &nbsp;Davy and Kat are going on their holidays on a cruise around the Mediterranean at the weekend. It all sounded a bit middle aged to me but I kept my mouth shut. &nbsp;Mum is going to visit Ann on Saturday and staying there until returning home on Sunday. I will have to co-ordinate myself with her so I can get down to Stratford at an appropriate time to drop off the coffee and bath things I brought for Mum.  &nbsp;Mum was on the phone this evening too. She’d been in to see the accountant so the taxation side of things was getting clearer in her head. She now has a scheme to move up to Gran’s house to avoid paying some tax or other in the future. Her current house could easily be let out I think, well, certainly a lot easier than Gran’s house. I was glad she’d realised this herself and David supported her in her reasoning. As yet, she hasn’t raised the issue with Ann. I can’t help wonder whether she thinks, as I do, that Ann is more of a hassle in the equation of running the farm than a help. I think it was Gran who described her in the terms of “a little bit of knowledge being a dangerous thing”. &nbsp;Earlier today I put some photos up on here too.  &nbsp;Maybe this weekend I’ll dig out my elective photos and add a few of them.

      I woke up this morning and so very nearly rolled back over to fall back asleep. Definately one of those days when mornings just disagree with me!  &nbsp;Made it in for 9am, spent first two hours with a play specialist before going to a tutorial with a very&nbsp;friendly paediatrician.&nbsp;Then it was swiftly on to grand round to consume some free lunch.&nbsp;Then straight afterwards&nbsp;I headed over to one of the wards for a tutorial&nbsp;with an SpR, who again turned out to be very friendly and&nbsp;chatty. (I think there's a theme here with paediatricians!)  Everything else is running along OK. One of&nbsp;my housemates who's moving&nbsp;out is having a few issues with her new landlord - I'm afraid to say I was polite enough to ask about things then clearly much too tired to actually take in what she was saying; but I'm sure I made the appropriate noises!&nbsp; &nbsp;After a quick trip to the library to photocopy articles for the elective project, I decided to go fill up Percy (my car). With petrol prices at silly levels I headed off to Tesco's thinking this would be relatively cheap at 81.9p per litre. My amusement came as I got out of my car on the forecourt and looked at the pump. It didn't seem to want to work, but I spotted two buttons on it: pay at pump and pay at till. Being a busy place I went for the first option, but as I reached for my credit card, low and behold a knight in shining armour (well, actually a shortish, asian guy in a security outfit) came to help me insert my credit card because these technical details are simply beyond me! He couldn't get the machine to work so poor damsel in distress me had to go into the shop to pay. Don't get me wrong, I, like most women I guess, appreciate a little help from time to time and it's kind of sweet when you get helped simply because you're female, but&nbsp;putting my credit card into a slot and pressing a button?! Heavens, isn't the world a dangerous place for a girl these days! My mind boggles... how did he think I coped at a cashpoint? Gasp! A slot, a series of on screen options and a four figure code to be imputted! It's clearly beyond my XX chromosomes to cope.  Oh yeah, I just changed toe template too. Thought this one looked nicer.

      Wonderful day so far, got up thinking my day started at nine but no it was half nine (half an hour lost asleep!). Then when I got to the thing I was supposed to be in, it was cancelled so there went my morning.  &nbsp;On an entirely different note I had assorted family members on the phone last night. It began with Mum saying about how things went at the solicitors, then Ann rang to say she was 'fine' about not being an executor. After that she decided she was going to find out how much I knew about Dad and his illness. About a week ago I mentioned in front of Ann that I thought he had schizophrenia - she claimed last night she'd known about it from the beginning and had urged Mum to tell Davy and me. Today in the cold light of day I'm wondering whether she was trying to stir something up with her continued "How do you feel about that?" etc. I just think that Mum clearly made the decision years ago not to tell&nbsp;us, for us to discover it for ourselves which I did. It's not as if I can do anything about it, I can't change my genetics!  &nbsp;Maybe on a more alarming note Ann confirmed my suspicions that there was an element of domestic violence, although to be true, Gran had already hinted at this many, many years ago. Just as Gran had already recently told me about Social Services being concerned about our wellbeing.  &nbsp;It is a funny life I lead! My parents separated&nbsp;when I was 1 1/2 and divorced by the time I reached 2. My Mum has never really spoken to&nbsp;either my brother or I about&nbsp;what the circumstances were at the time. I was never told he had a serious mental illness - I was to discover it for myself when at 17 I saw him presumably just after a hefty dose of anti-pyschotics and the side effects were so evident that they stuck in my mind. I always grew up thinking he was essentially a bad person but now I have no idea where the schizophrenia starts and where the person ends. Although today I can honestly say that I don't know the man very well anyway. I might see him twice or maybe three times a year; and other than that he shows little interest in whatever I'm doing.  &nbsp;Right, back to phone calls...&nbsp;somehow my brother rang and I told him about Mum's stance and Ann's opinion. He raised&nbsp;the very really issue of security,&nbsp;Gran's house is&nbsp;not being lived in but it's full of expensive stuff. I then&nbsp;told him about the conversation with Ann about Dad and he raised his concerns about he or I ever developing the condition.&nbsp;I simply re-assured him that&nbsp;like me, there is simply nothing we can do about it.  &nbsp;On a more amusing note, I&nbsp;realised afterwards that my housemates could have heard everything I said on the phone - poor things! How confused they must be about what's going&nbsp;on....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;Monday and a day of lectures for me. Wouldn't have been so bad only I was so sleepy in the morning session that I was really fighting to stay awake. There's only so many times I can wiggle on my chair before I start getting funny looks. Luckily the afternoon session went a bit better and I was wide awake for Non-accidental Injury and Common Paediatric Surgical Problems.  &nbsp;Mum rang this afternoon twice. She'd been in to see the solicitor about Gran's will and apparently my aunt wasn't an executor (as she&nbsp;expected she would be!) - oh dear I could see some sparks flying here. Then casting my mind back I remembered&nbsp;how a few years ago Gran and Ann had 'words' and Gran mentioning&nbsp;changing her will;&nbsp;but I'd assumed, like Mum, she'd changed it back. Obviously not! I think it was probably a reflexion of how far Ann had drifted from Gran that Gran didn't hold her in that high a&nbsp;regard, instead&nbsp;one of my Great Aunts will be an executor as well as the family solicitor and Mum. I don't really know how Ann took the news, Mum said something about a 'brave face' but it's difficult to judge on the phone.  &nbsp;I've set myself a target of >2000 words of elective project to be written by the weekend, so I'd better get cracking!&nbsp;

      Hello again, yep, 2 posts in 1 day... what a bargain-y bonus-y day this is! &nbsp;Just forgot to mention my star purchase yesterday, a funky shoulder bag! For a great price of £19.95. I'm determined it's NOT a handbag because that would be far too middle aged. Anyhow, my bag is just the right size to fit the majority of the junk I've been carrying around in my jacket pockets - keys, pens, paper, tissues, tampax, you know the sort of junk...  Here's the website of the manufacturers:  urlLink http://www.puresativa.com &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm a bit hesitant of the some of the 'goods' they have on offer at this site (seeds); but the bag is funky. I even got a free keyring with it too, although as it displays a cannabis leaf clearly on it maybe I should be cautious of pulling my keys out in front of a stuffy old consultant.  Good heavens, this weekend I've come over all girly!  Oh and my elective photos are looking very nice. I think the photographer should be congratulated (I'll be drinking a glass of Pimms and Coke later). I now have a very picturesque photo of the sun rising over the Grand Canyon on my wall (yes, it was worth getting up at 4:15am for!) and a photo of me in front of a Vernal Falls in Yosemite National Park too.  By the way, I finally put a photo of me on my profile too today. Only one problem with it, I was 17 when it was taken, so I'm wearing a school&nbsp;uniform. Must go, tea is cooking.&nbsp;

      I'm going to start my cursing my computer for crashing just after I'd written a great big chunk-of-a-blog and was running a spell check. Needless to say my efforts have disappeared and I'm irritated!  Right what have I been up to? Well, lots really.  My world was turned upside down a fortnight ago when my grandmother died. Despite her being 87 and me only being 23 we were very close. She had always been there in my thinking. I think pretty much all of my earliest memories envolved her in some way or another. It hit me harder than I realised it would - I had lost a much loved Grandmother and a very good friend.  &nbsp;I'm not so sure whether I had quite realised how ill she was, I suppose more than anything I always imagined&nbsp;that this very strong and determined&nbsp;lady whould somehow&nbsp;stabilise but it wasn't to be. I&nbsp;just feel relieved that her final few hours&nbsp;of decline were softened by morphine. All I can say is that heart failure and fibrosing alveolitis are not a nice way to go; just&nbsp;try watching someone you know and love fighting for breath whilst being on oxygen therapy. &nbsp;It amazes me, and it was pretty much all I could think about during the funeral a week ago, how well she coped with her condition.&nbsp;She knew she was going to die soon yet she remained positive, I could still get a smile from her with one of my&nbsp;bizarre&nbsp;coments.&nbsp;She was still fully aware of what was going&nbsp;on into her final hours, enough to instruct family members to keep an eye on my Mum and Aunt. I think it was purely a matter of faith - there was no doubt in her mind at any time about her strong Christian beliefs in&nbsp;death and the afterlife. Sitting here today thinking about it I must say that I'm in awe of that level of faith. As we sorted out her things, I found her&nbsp;bible and&nbsp;since neither my Mum nor Aunt wanted it, I took it,&nbsp;it&nbsp;has become one of my cherished possessions.  &nbsp;I saw my Gran's body about 10 minutes after she'd died and I was relieved for her that her struggle was over. Last weekend we buried her in the same grave as my Grandfather, beside my Great Uncle. I&nbsp;like to think that they're all catching up somewhere and no doubt looking down on us from time to time, probably having a joke at out expense.  Anyhow, on a different note, I'm now half way through my pediatrics block. Today I am supposed to be writing my elective project - but hey! Blogging is such a good distraction.  Right back to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The day of the sore throat - that's what I've christened today.  Yesterday's mild sore throat had turned into a monster when I woke up this morning. It's a horrible one where I'm fine speaking, just swallowing is painful. It hasn't really gotten very much better throughout today either which irriatates me, as I took today off to recover.  On the weather front it was another day with a funky thunder and lightening storm.

       Woke up early this morning at 6am and got up shortly after. Fitted in doing my problem based learning questions before leaving for hospital.  Had a very interesting clinic with a very chatty paediatrician who gave us a quick tutorial on Occam's Razor - essentially this is the theory that if explanations are stipped down to the simplest theory, this is the most likely reason. (Will have to look this up in fursther detail, but it interested me)  Had a sore throat all day, and was feeling a bit feverish at times, so dosed myself with paracetamol or aspirin and things seemed better.  Weather still clammy. Have just tidied room.

      Another day with not much done in terms of achievement.  Spent the morning waiting for a washing machine to be delivered - my timetable was blank anyway, so nothing lost there. Then there really didn't seem much point going in for an hour of teaching at 4pm, so stayed at home.

      Today was the first Monday morning for quite a while where I haven’t had to fight myself to stay awake in lectures. Don’t know why that was.  Had a practical skills session this afternoon too, it was good apart from a useless SHO trying to teach us about developmental milestones. I object to being murmured at.  The weather was quite sticky today. Luckily this afternoon there were some brief rumbles of thunder and a few drops of rain to dissipate the mugginess.  I had Ann on the phone this evening, she was concerned about Mum. In the room Mum stayed there was a ¾ length mirror which she had apparently turned to face the wall. Ann was concerned as this probably indicates that Mum has pretty low self esteem. It doesn’t surprise me, she has put on a lot of weight over the past year or so, but I don’t see how she thinks running from the problem is going to help. I suggested we gently suggested she add to her interests something at the leisure centre like swimming as I’m sure they must have at least one session a week of women only.  I got another edition of Runner’s World today, reminding me that I haven’t done any real exercise myself for a few months.

       Sunday and no rest day for me. I woke at about 8:45am, earlier than I’d have liked for a Sunday but I had places to be. Still couldn’t organise myself very well though, was supposed to be in Stratford for 10:00am, I made it there for 10:45am.  Couldn’t help but initially feel that Ann wasn’t best impressed with my presence, not that I really cared. Mum remarked, probably for the sake of having something to say, that she’d never been to some out-of-town store or other, so needless to say, off we went. It was tacky and cheap, I’m sure Mum won’t be returning. Then much to my horror there was a B&Q next door so we wondered into that too. Why people go to these nasty stores on Sundays is beyond me, have they got nothing better to do with their time?  Lunch was supposed to be at 2:00pm, so I thought, but no being a barbeque it was eventually cooked by 3:15pm (I was hoping for an early-ish return home too!). Had a chat with my cousin Bridget, discussed Mum with Ann after she’d left at 4:00pm. Ann clearly thinks I’m doing too much for Mum, and looking at today I have to say that I won’t be going down to Stratford again simply because Mum wants me too. It seems like a case of cruel to be kind, but I can’t live her life for her. Nor can I drop everything to keep her company to allay her fears.  If only things were simple.  Got back home at about 5:30pm. Haven’t achieved anything much this evening. Had Mum on the phone twice already, neither about anything important.   Another source of irritation is that I still haven’t ventured out to do any form of exercise.  All in all, not a productive weekend.
