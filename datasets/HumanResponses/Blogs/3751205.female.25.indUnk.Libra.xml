      "How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...   "I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible.   "My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a 'lone traveler' and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude..."       "My political ideal is democracy. Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized. It is an irony of fate that I myself have been the recipient of excessive admiration and reverence from my fellow-beings, through no fault, and no merit, of my own. The cause of this may well be the desire, unattainable for many, to understand the few ideas to which I have with my feeble powers attained through ceaseless struggle. I am quite aware that for any organization to reach its goals, one man must do the thinking and directing and generally bear the responsibility. But the led must not be coerced, they must be able to choose their leader. In my opinion, an autocratic system of coercion soon degenerates; force attracts men of low morality... The really valuable thing in the pageant of human life seems to me not the political state, but the creative, sentient individual, the personality; it alone creates the noble and the sublime, while the herd as such remains dull in thought and dull in feeling.   "This topic brings me to that worst outcrop of herd life, the military system, which I abhor... This plague-spot of civilization ought to be abolished with all possible speed. Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately I hate them!   "The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery -- even if mixed with fear -- that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man... I am satisfied with the mystery of life's eternity and with a knowledge, a sense, of the marvelous structure of existence -- as well as the humble attempt to understand even a tiny portion of the Reason that manifests itself in nature."    A. Einstein

      I know I haven't been posting my own thoughts on her yet. Surprisingly, It has proven very difficult, which is a tough thing to accept coming from a person who used to write a lot. Since getting married and having children I feel like a considerable amount of creativity has been sucked dry from my being. I don't resent them for it, for it is not their fault I just need to step back, take a deep breath, and ease my way into it and to my surprise it has proven to be truly intimidating! I feel terrible and it's making me depressed. Maybe that will release me from the quandaries in which I cling!  Well, there you have it.

      This is in memory of a Very talented young man who has touched the lives of many in a profound way. God rest his soul.   "I Am"  I am black. I am white. I am all skin in between. I am young. I am old. I am each age that has been.  I am scrawny.  I am well fed.  I am starving for attention.  I am famous.  I am cryptic.  I am hardly worth the mention.  I am short.  I am height. I am any frame or stature. I am smart.  I am challenged.  I am striving for a future. I am able.  I am weak.  I am some strength.  I am none. I am being.  I am thoughts. I am all things, said and done.  I am born.  I am dying.  I am dust of humble roots.  I am grace.  I am pain.  I am labor of willed fruits. I am a slave.  I am free.  I am bonded to my life. I am rich.  I am poor.  I am wealth amid strife.  I am a shadow.  I am glory. I am hiding from my shame. I am hero.  I am loser.  I am yearning for a name. I am empty.  I am proud.  I am seeking my tomorrow.  I am growing.  I am fading.  I am hope amid the sorrow.  I am certain.  I am doubtful.  I am desperate for solutions.  I am leader.  I am student.  I am fate and evolutions. I am spirit.  I am voice.  I am memories not recalled. I am chance.  I am cause. I am effort, blocks and walls.  I am him.  I am her.  I am reasons without rhymes.  I am past.  I am nearing.  I am present in all times.  I am many.  I am no one.  I am seasoned by each being.  I am me.  I am you.  I am all souls now decreeing. I am.     "Mattie"  Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek   Peacemaker and Poet Born: July 17, 1990 Died: June 22, 2004

      When will we ever realize that we are the masters of our own destinies. And when will we get it through our thick skulls that everyone else most certainly does NOT have it all together. Grass looks so much more lush and green on the other side doesn't it?  Everyone has skeletons in their closet, why do I worry so much about my own bones rattling too loud. Probably because we cannot hide our bones, sometimes they are in the wide open for the world to see, and to have so much disdain towards ourselves or anyone for that matter is so unhealthy.  I have turned a new leaf today and I am not looking back. This is a new Sarah! Designer of my own fate, conqueror of life and love, ruler over all that is within me!  Today is a good day and looks quite hopeful. If only every day were as sweet.  When will the world learn to sit back, take a deep breath, and just relax! LIFE IS AS GOOD AS YOU MAKE IT!
