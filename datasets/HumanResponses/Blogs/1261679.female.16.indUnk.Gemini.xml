       My intelligent conversation with White Chocolate aka Elise:  elisebee06: Liar! aquafina seaweed: I'm not a liar! I'm a truther! elisebee06: see you changed your spelling from liar to lyer.. elisebee06: therfore admitting I am right!! aquafina seaweed: See? a TRUTHER! elisebee06: what?? elisebee06: truther isn't a word you crazy! aquafina seaweed: what's the opposite of liar? elisebee06: truthful person? aquafina seaweed: I guess, but i like words that end in -er elisebee06: No  elisebee06: no elisebee06: n elisebee06: oo aquafina seaweed: see? you are a Noer! elisebee06: kiss my butt amanda! aquafina seaweed: you kiss my booty! aquafina seaweed: my mocha choca booty! elisebee06: no one wants to kiss your butt amanda:-! elisebee06: thats GROSS! Yeah.  We even addressed the spelling of "liar." Anyway, I just started out this journal.  Who knows?  This might be my last entry. By the way, is my blog green?  If so, that was totally a coincidence, you know, about the whole booger/snot theme.  Sorry if that's too gory for you.  I mean that's not too gory for me, because I have nightmares about my big-lipped English teacher, Miss  Eye-Corn, eating me up.  I know she really would if she had the chance to.  I just shudder at the thought of it.  Going to English class in fear of being devoured!!  Man!  Why couldn't I just have a normal life?!?

       Hey fellow humans or alien satellite interceptors.  By the way, what’s going on out there in space?  I hope you’re not having a war there also, because the war here, on earth, is very depressing.  It’s inevitable, meaning that if we didn’t have the war in the first place, Saddam Hussein would be a very dangerous, or much more dangerous threat, to mankind.  And all those war protester people make me so mad, because if we didn’t have the war, it would be like sitting back and doing nothing.  Those people are just doing that so they can say they have a hobby, which they really don’t.  They need to get out more, like that Michael Moore guy at the Oscars.  He needs to exercise a bit, not just walking around in circles holding a sign up.  That’s like burning a pound, Mr. Moore!    MUAHAHAHA!! Okay, kids.  I’ve finally decided what I want to be when I grow up!  A VAMPIRE!  No the females are called Vampiresses.  I want to be a Vampiress when I grow up!!  I’ll have long black hair with white highlights and I’ll pin it up like Marge Simpson!  And I’ll have really cool fangs- long and sharp and, um, bloody?  I don’t like blood.  That’s why I don’t want to be a doctor when I grow up, so scratch the vampire thing!  He he.  Oh now I know!  I want to be a person that’s always in the “after” pictures for all those diet and exercise machine campaigns.  That would be so fun!  The fat people get the ugly clothes and no makeup, but the skinnier people get all the pampering!!  And the cool clothes!!  I would also like to win  eight Grammys .  Norah Jones is so lucky and talented!!  I want to be just like her now!!    You know, there’s this thing dog-like thing that my family is housing that is of relation to me.  He’s actually my cousin and he’s one of those people who you really, really don’t want to be associated with.  He’s somebody that you don’t want to say is related to you.  He’s just like a dog too!  Crawling around on the floor, always scratching himself, and-um- looking at porno on my computer??  You don’t know how grossed out I was when I saw this file named “Britney and JLo Together in Bed.”  There were like three pictures deleted of JLo!!   Scary, scary, scary .  I feel very sorry for Ms. Lopez.  I can hear an ice-cream truck in the distance…ahh, Heaven.    Well enough now.  I’m going bouncing.  Why do people say that anyway?  “ Gotta bounce !! LOL!!”  He he.  Web-savvy teenagers are the most fun people to talk to.    PS:  Elise!  We need to make our shirts!!  And I ain't Khan's or Austin's girlfriend!!

      Sup, kids?!? Yo Frothy Coffee what's going on with your man, Legolas?  I hear you guys are getting to be good friends now!  That darn fried blonde girl, "MB!"  You know, all you have to do is use a ghetto pickup line!  Proof:  aquafina seaweed: then i think i will start with a ghetto pick up line too! elisebee06: it works!!!!!!!!  And White Chocolate!  You gotta "lure" Viggo (not you dan you weirdo who thinks every girl likes you) away from his girlfriend, because I know he would leave her for you!!  Lure!  Like bait on a fishing line, except for the hooking and reeling part--yeah that would kind of hurt. You know what? I should be following my own advice.  PUH!!  Who cares?!?

      Yet another day in the life of me, Miss Choca.  (My real name is Amanda, by the way.)  Some people call me Mandy Candy.  What the f?!?  It's too icky sounding.  You know, like, to bubblegum poppy girly.  >:P!!  Anyway, I'm supposed to see How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.  I don't even know why I want to see it!  I hate chicky flickies.  You know, like the ones that are so predictable.  It just seems like a "comic relief-y" type movie.  But Bethy-Wethy told me that she saw it and it makes you want to have a boyfriend.  I don't think I'll get a boyfriend, so I'm taking a big risk in seeing this movie.  After Elise sees this movie, she'll be with her Viggo!!  Carolyn will be with her Legolas!!  I will be with Keroppi.

      Hello everyone!  (All of you nonexistent readers!)  How are you?   Well it has been kind of a long time, because it is now the 27th, and my last entry was on the 18th.  I am very sorry for that.  Anyway... Hmm, my Biology teacher is evil.   Eeeeeeeeeeevil .  No, you haven't seen evil until your biology teacher gives you a lab to do at home, and to top it all off-  With a  meterstick.  What the fudgsicle?!?  >:O!!   You know what bugs me?  When musicians don't update their tour diaries.  It's so annoying because they do have a lot of time, I mean they can skip all of their sleeping hours for just one entry, you know what I mean?  Like photo shoots are really that tiring.  I don't think so!!  If I were a rockstar, I wouldn't leave my fans hanging, the very few I'd have.  It would be fun.  I'm seriously thinking about becoming one.   I lost interest in a lot of things over time, for example : Brandon Boyd, Keroppi, stalking, hygiene... Now I'm re-discovering my obsessions.  (Not Keroppi, though...No  way!)   He he he Okay now I have to get back to that biology lab.    P. S.- "But soft!  What light through yonder window breaks?"  Nice use of iambic pentameter, I must say! ;)

      I'm  innie !! Okay, kids!! A lot happened over the weekend.  Let's start on Friday, actually.  I saw What A Girl Wants with Elise and Laurel, Bethy, Michelle.  OHHHHHHHHHH myyyy GOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSHHHHHHH!!!  I was smitten!! Oliver James: the cutest actor! He's all mine, Elise!!  You can have Bostjan and Sark, but  Oliver's mine !  He he!  Well anyway, On Saturday I went to La Grange for the MS-150.  No I didn't actually bike, it was just that we had to help the rifers ( I mean riders) for the Healix team.  I'm doing it next year, though!  I can't wait!  That night we stayed in a bed and breakfast called:  "Granny's Bed & Breakfast Inn."  Now isn't that supposed to hint something there?!?  It was like staying at the  Wunderlich Farms , man!!  They even had the original copy of Animal Farm!!  Scary...  On Sunday I went to visit my sister at her dorm in UT.  Her dorm is so cool!  (Although she has a creepy roommate who could tell you anything about the war...) I can't believe she doesn't decorate it.  I'd have posters all over the place, man.  (Of Oliver James!!)  Muahahaha!!!   So all my orchestra friends are bringing dates to the end-of-year banquet.  Well, one is lucky enough to already have one, and the other is hesitant about asking.  I am thinking about asking  Spottie Dottie , but I'm so scared that he'll say no.  I mean, he has all right to say no and I wouldn't be mad because there's no way he can go with someone else.  But I'd die if he said no!! So I'm not taking any risks and I'm saving my life before it's too late.  Unless someone convinces me (with some lovely persuasion!)  or forces me (like threatening me or something) then I will have to leave him alone.  I'm very tempted, but I am brutally realistic.  If anyone has a good probability statement on his chances of saying yes to me out of 10, I might do it!  Emphasis on the  might , because I've never done anything like that before.    So there you go!  And by the way, you  can  have your cake and eat it too.  (Take that Ashley Olsen!!) I'm  outie !

      Shakespeare was a homo.  I bet he has a boyfriend right now in HE double hockey sticks!!  Just kidding, William.  I haven't started that Great Expectations english essay.  It's due Friday, but I have an orchestra concert tomorrow night.  First chair of the second violins...woohoo.  Inner circle power!    I'm stupid.  Need I say more?

      This entry will be about animals today.  I have this friend who wants to hook me up with this frog.  Think this is a good idea?  Remember that story,  The Frog Prince ?  If I kiss him will be turn into a prince, or will I just get a wart and have to live with the fact I dated a frog?  We'll never know... Anyway, I have developed a new fear of dogs.  I am so afraid of dogs, especially the one that's living with me.  And I don't even have a dog.  ;)  Peace, love, and ice cream trucks.

      I watched Jay Leno last night and they had a little special airing of a live debate between the two most ignorant 18-year-olds in the world.  "Point: What's Your Point?"  Yeah.  It was mighty funny, I tell ya!  Both of the kids (one was a girl and one was a guy) agreed that the saying "I traveled around the world," was invalid because, according to them, "you can't see the  backside  of California!!"  And that guy's going to TCU!!  It's so sad, sad, sad.    I've got a lot of summer goals.  I will list them for you: (1) Lose 10 pounds! (2) Learn how to play guitar. (3) Think of better jokes/comebacks.  (They always come in handy!) (4) Learn more card tricks/games!!  (Fun, fun, fun stuff!!) (5) Stop being so internet dependent.  (6) Grow! (At least 6 inches :D) (7) Try to be smarter, grade-wise, which basically means to adapt new study habits.  (Like, um, yeah    right!! Hehhhehehe) (8) Try to be a better person in general.  :)- I love all the people who care to read my blog.  It really feels good inside.

      Hey, so I'm at home, basking in my laziness, and also CELEBRATING MY LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!  Fun, fun, fun.  Nothing to worry about for a looong time.  This isn't so bad.    You know my worst pet peeve ever is when people step on the back of my shoes.  It fricking bugs me sooo much.  It almost equals PMS, but not quite.  (hehehe)  Especially when you're wearing flip-flops.    My taste in music is changing ever so fastly.  I am really very annoyed by Maroon 5 right now, and I don't know why!!  I used to be obsessed with them!  Not a big loss though.  I also cannot bring myself to listen to any Incubus, because I just recently found out that Brandon Boyd was bisexual and was too open about it that they lost Dirk Lance (the bassist) because of it.  Scary.  I was obsessed with Brandon Boyd man!  It's so scary that I can't listen to them anymore.  Oh well...I still have a 50% chance of hooking up with him now.  :D  That was crazy...but Elise also told me that, so me not so crazy!!  I also realized that I don't like "yelly" music.  Whenever I see a commercial or something for a band I'm like "I have to listen to them!!"  And then after I force myself to like them, I still don't.  For example: Taking Back Sunday, The Starting Line, Good Charlotte.  The list goes on, but I can't remember it all.  It's so blah, if you know what I mean.  I love Phantom Planet, Nikka Costa, John Mayer, Jason Mraz, and OK go very much.  That would be the perfect concert too!!  Well, so, hmm, this is just like an awkward silence, which I've had the opportunity to experience finally...:D  Yeah that was great.  But I guess it's for education when you're stuck in your next situation, right?  Yeah, that's what I'll keep telling myself.    I cannot wait until guitar lessons!!  It's gonna be so incredibly fun!!  Yay, yay, yay!!  I really wanna be in a band, but I don't know.  I have a few friends who said that they wanted to be in a band -me singing- but they haven't mentioned anything lately.  (This is your cue!)  Yeah, that's my dream...and living in a country-style peaceful house in SoCal, or a penthouse loft in NYC or Chicago.  That would be amazing--having a good husband and a dog---okay sorry I'm kinda dozing off into daydreaming...:D  Well then, I bid thee farewell with a few notes on the future-- >>I might not update as frequently during June, so entertain yourself with past archives. >My birthday's on June 10th...(Hint! Hint!-- Remember Mrs. Metzler?!)   -Mandy Candy- **Ice cream trucks**

      Hello again everyone!  Well now.  School is almost over!  (Only two more real days.)  Geometry final :P  Stinks.    Okay, I didn't have much to say.  Sorry!  Maybe next time it'll be more interesting.   -Manda-  PS- Tammy saved my life last night!  "White People Cards (aka Egyptian Ratscrew)" and VC :)  that was great!  He he he.

      It has been almost a month since I have written (typed) last.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  Limited access to a working computer is not exactly my kind of paradise.  If you have been a consistent reader [Casper], you might know that this dog who is almost 150 lbs and speaks Thai lives with me and looks at porno occasionally.  Stupid dog.  I wish there was a pound where we could send unwanted guests.  Stupid cousin freak thing.    ANYWAY!  I have a new impetus for living!  Jason Mraz's music!  (And probably Jason Mraz!)  (Probably not...) (Yeah it's because he smokes.)  Useless parenthetical phrases aren't so useless after all!  Let's see:   "Remedy (I Won't Worry)"   I saw fireworks from the freeway and behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away Cause you were born on the fourth of july, freedom ring  now something on the surface it stings that something on the surface it kind of makes me nervous who says that you deserve this and what kind of god would serve this? We will cure this dirty old disease if you've got the poison I've got the remedy  the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.  I wont worry my life away. I wont worry my life away.  I heard two men talking on the radio in a cross fire kind of new reality show Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack  they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the be right back after this the unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast his catastrophy dance with me, because if you've got the poison, I've got the remedy   the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.  I wont worry my life away. I wont worry my life away.  When I fall in love I take my time There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why Because  the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.  I wont worry my life away. I wont worry my life away. I wont and I wont and I wont [etc.]  -Download it-  I love love love that song.  I'm taking guitar lessons in July.  Rediscovering my obsession with wanting to be a musician!  (No "rockstar" term anymore, too general.  But musician is even more general.  Oh well  It's just that when you tell someone that you want to be a rockstar, they automatically think GODSMACK!  And picture you jumping up and down with an electric Fender in your hands smashing it on the stage while screaming your head off into a nonexistent microphone. Yeah.)  Stupid parenthetical phrases!!  Shoot them.  (But don't sue me when you break you computer.)    I think me and Elise's (Yes, yes, me and Elise's.  I used incorrect English in attempt to not sound weird.  Elise and my...??  That sounds very very gross.  I'm a stupid parenthetical phrase.)  conversations have gotten a bit more sophisticated.  You should hear us!  Look for me when I get to be 22.  I'll have a different name, though.  (Musician name, like Tori Amos.)  Get it? Top future names: 1.  Aquafina Seaweed (...which by the way is my AIM screen name if ya wanna slap me on your buddy list.) 2.  Amanda Mraz 3.  Amanda Boyd  Outie!

      So here I am again sitting at the computer.  It's not actually the same computer I've been generating my previous entries from; it's my mom's laptop.  Laptops are sooo, incredibly portable.  I mean, they're supposed to be but it's unbelievable when you actually use one.  But it's so slow!!  Maybe because it's so small or maybe I downloaded too many songs at one time.  I just watched a creepy CSI.  It was about magicians.  I hate clowns because they do magic, too.  They're scary.  I have an irrational fear of clowns, just like Tino from "The Weekenders!"  It started when I went to a company picnic for my mom's work.  There was this girl who wouldn't leave me alone and she had to go and she wanted my number and I said that I would get my mom to give it to her mom, but I didn't even know her name, but I would have forgotten it instantly.  Anyway, at the same instant she asked for my number, this clown said "Can I have it too?"  Oh boy, how creeped out I was.  At the tender age of 11, I could not tell if the clown was joking or if he was being very inappropriate and wrong.  Yeah.  Or maybe it started when "Are You Afraid of the Dark" started and in the intro there was this tall clown statue with a creepy grimace on his face and every time they flashed it, a creepy string bass slid to an E.  (Shuddering.)  I have a feeling this will be a creepy night, because this Daria episode is all about people telling scary stories.  "I don't get it. Why am I almost perfect?  It's my eyelids!  They're fat!"  He he he.  That is the best and perfect cartoon.  I remember when it was regularly aired on MTV and I watched (Oh my God, Daria just ended very creepily and I'm practically home alone! Okay, back to the entry...) it and the movies they made about her like "Is it Fall Yet?" Okay, I have no life because I'm justifying this on my own.  I'm not some former cheerleader who broke her ankle and got fat and now stays home and eats Homemade Vanilla Blue Bell ice-cream who needs her friends to kick some sense back into her, no that's not me.  I don't need a reality check because I'm already in reality!!  He he he.  (Even Stevens is better.)  Doesn't Shia LaBeouf remind anybody of Austin Rourke? There's just a strange comparison.  Maybe it's just me.  Dunno.  Anyway, I'm actually writing this entry in an e-mail I'm sending to myself which I'm going to put shove into my blog later in effort to keep the URL to my blog-site available on my mom's laptop because it's just wrong for any member of my family to read this kind of stuff, but my big sister reads it regularly and my little sister found out about it and might try to blackmail me with all the info I've put in here.  Okay I better stop there.  I'll add a song also, so you can download it and everytime you play, you'll think of me and my fear of clowns...   "When I Get You Alone," by Thicke Oooh... Eah!  [Verse 1:] Baby girl, where you at? Got no strings, got men attached Can't stop that feelin' for long no Mmmm You makin' dogs wanna beg Breaking them off your fancy legs But they make you feel right at home, now  [Hook 1:] (Ooooh) See all these illusions just take us too long (Ooooh) And I want it bad.. Because you walk pretty, Because you talk pretty, 'Cause you make me sick  And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'  [Hook 2:] (Ahhh) Oh I swear there's something when she's pumpin', Asking for a raise (Oooh) Well does she want me to carry her home now? (Oooh) So does she want me to buy her things? On my house, on my job On my loot, shoes, my shirt, My crew, my mind, my father's last name?  [Chorus:] (Ahhh) When I get you alone ('lone) When I get you you'll know baby (know) When I get you alone ('lone) When I get you alone now (it's all mine)  (Ahhhh....oh) Come on Oh yeah-yeah  [Verse 2:] Baby girl you da shit That makes you my equivalent Well you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight, All right All my dawgs talkin' fast- Aint you got some photographs? 'Cause you shook that room like a star, now Yes you did, oh  [Hook 1:] (Ooooh) All these intrusions just take us too long (Ooooh) And I want you so bad.. Because you walk steady, Because you talk steady, 'Cause you make me sick  And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'  [Hook 2:] (Ahhh) So I pray to something she aint bluffin', Rubbin' up on me (Oooh) Well does she want me to make a vow? Check it (Oooh)Well does she want me to make it now? On my house, on my job On my loot, shoes, my voice, My crew, my mind, my father's last name?  [Chorus:] (Ahhh) When I get you alone ('lone) When I get you you'll know baby (know) When I get you alone ('lone) When I get you alone now (it's all mine)  (Ahhhh....oh)  Oh no Get you alone baby Oohh..  Oooh..oh-oh That a girl! You get some  [Hook 1:] (Ahhh) All these intrusions just take us too long (Ahhh) And I want you so bad.. Because you walk pretty, (You, you-you) Because you talk pretty, (You get some) 'Cause you make me sick  And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'  [Hook 2:] (Ahhh) But I pray to something when she's pumpin', Rubbin' up on me, now (Oooh) Want me to break it down? Check it (Oooh) Well did you want me to make it now? On my house, on my job On my loot, shoes, my voice, My crew, my mind, my father's last name?  [Chorus:] (Ahhh) When I get you alone ('lone) When I get you you'll know girl (know) When I get you alone ('lone) When I get you alone now (it's all mine)  (Ahhh) I get you alone ('lone) When I get you you'll know (know) I get you alone ('lone) When I get you alone (it's all mine) Yeah  Yeaaahhh.......

      I am sorry that I haven't updated this blog soon enough for all of you curious people!!  (Because I just know you're curious.)  There is a fine line between curiousity and nosiness.  Keep yo nose to ya self.  Wise words.  Anyway...Let's see.  I love getting voicemails on my cell phone.  It is very very exciting.  To all you people who know my cell number, please call it and leave an interesting message.  My little ditty dooty that answers when I'm not there is still in progress.  I kind of messed it up... Too lazy to fix it!!  (Story of my life!)  I left myself three messages.  Now don't say that's weird too soon, because it is very addictive once you start.  First I told myself to change the ditty dooty (which I did).  You know how you sound so much different when you're recorded?  I hate that because I like the sound of my voice.  It's not too deep, not too high.  That's because it vibrates in your head, making it sound deeper than it really is.  I sound icky recorded!!  The other two messages are of me singing, because I've never heard my singing voice recorded.  "She is Always On My Mind," Phantom Planet and "Excuse Me Mr.," No Doubt.  Lalala.  I sound like a little girl.  It ain't fair. :'(    I am leaving tomorrow!  Yay!  I love flying.  It's so fun like Puzzle Fighter 2X!!  And Tekken 3, and Dynasty Warriors 4.  And any RPG game.  Yeah, I've rekindled my relationship with the Playstation, but unfortunately I have the PSone, not the PS2, which really really really makes me want to eat my head.  (But don't worry!  That's virtually impossible!!)  Hehehe.    My sisters are very nice.  Not too much the Nina, but the Natalie is nice.  I'm getting her a Game Boy!  The new one that folds, you know?  Yeah, and with an aluminum case, and I want to play Zelda!!  I have a craving for playing Zelda with the creepy owl and the evil chickens and the weird unidentifiable things that make you lose hearts.  That's the life.  " Caught in the Rain ," Revis  Is it real, we're always the same We're almost unknown now Well I was caught in the rain Wasting my time on the ground Waiting the call, of what would you say? Can you come over? Well, I was caught in the rain Wasting my time on the ground.  [Chorus] It was you, who could get me high With whatever you say You tell me something real What we do, it doesn't matter now Whatever it takes, for you to stay with me.  Trading thoughts, crossing the room I saw you surrounded I was caught in the rain Wasting my time on the ground Feeling this fall, without an escape I almost let you down I was caught in the rain Wasting my time on the ground.  [Chorus]  It was you, who could get me high With whatever you say You tell me something real What we do, it doesn't matter now Well I was caught in the rain You make me feel You make me feel Make me feel  I was caught in the rain Wasting my time on the ground I was caught in the rain Wasting my time on the ground I was caught in the rain Caught in the rain.   That is a great song, but probably their only great song.  Tear.  I think I will include a recommended song in every entry, so the whole world will be listening to good music.  I think that is a good idea.    Well, I guess this is a good stopping point.  My booty is vibrating. That must mean someone's just pulled into the driveway!  (My sisters and dad.)  Yay! I'm out my homies. P.S.- Today's my birthday.

It is the greatest.    Summer is lagging a bit.  I am leaving for Los Angeles, California in six days.  I am going to have sooo much fun!!  Yeah.  There is no more drama in my life and nothing to write about.  Sorry if this is boring.    You know what song be the best situation?  Let me copy and paste it for you ;) (hehehe): " Without You ," Justincase feat. Michelle Branch It's been two weeks Three days long I'm all alone since you've been gone I can't keep myself from asking why Just wanna see my reflection In your eyes  Just know that I'm with you And what you feel I feel it too  (Chorus)  I'm feeling lately I'm going crazy Wondering how I'll go on without you I keep on trying Slowly dying Thinking of how I need you here with me  I wear your shirt The scent of you Reminds of the night that we became two There's nothing else  That feels the same Everyday there's sun, it feels just like rain  Just know that I'm with you And what you feel I feel it too  (repeat chorus)  If you think it's easy for me Well, you're wrong Sometimes I'm weak and baby you know I'm not that strong  You're in New York And I'm in L.A. There's so much to tell you Words I need to say But your phone keeps ringing [ ringing, ringing ]  (repeat chorus)  I need you here with me  How will I go on without you?  It's been two weeks Three days long I'm all alone since you've been gone   I hope that happens to me later in life.  Feel free to download that.  It's a bit sappy, but, as I said before, the perfect situation.  I'd be in New York, an absent boyfriend in LA... Fantasizing future situations is a hobby of mine, unfortunately.    I have another topic to address.  Why can't anyone spell the word  definitely ?  NO ONE CAN!!  It's a common trait.  My mom even said no one could spell at her workplace either.  I'm just wondering.  It's always spelled  definately, definatly , or  defanitely .  I don't know, it's just something I've notice and never expressed.    I learned how to play VC (Vietnamese Cards)!!  It is a very easy concept... I wanna play Tammy to see how good I am!!  She'd start with an 8-card straight or something, then I'd pass, then she'd go again with triple 7's, then I'd beat her 7's with Kings, then she'd pass, then I'd go with a 6-card straight, she'd pass, a suit (or family), she'd pass, then I'd put down a low single card, she'd put down her 2 of hearts, then I'd slam it with four 6's, then I'd put my final card down (a nine)... hahaha.  I have it all planned out.  (You better watch out Tammo.)  I've recently become addicted to KleinForums.com.  It's all Tammy's fault too!  Hahaha, ok.  No one knows who I am on the forums either.  (Except for Dan R.)  It's fun!!   I have a feeling someone will ask soon.  I hate giving away my name.  They're like, "Whaa?  That's not your name!" or "Are you that short girl who always so quiet in class?" or "I've heard of you before," when I've known her/him for three years.  It's depressing yet refreshing.  Yes, both.  First you get depressed, then you get refreshed.  It's just like a Mr. Goodbar:  "First you taste the peanuts, then you taste the chocolate."  It's actually logically the other way around, but the slogan flows better.    I'm trying to learn some French before my trip to Montreal, too.  I don't know any though, so there was no point in me starting a new paragraph.  (AHH!!! Lawn mowers outside= loud.  Good grief.)  Nothing else to say, so I will leave you satisfied with a farewell and an extra random statement.  Yours Truly,    amanda    PS: Britney Spears cursed us all.

      It's Independence Day!  Most people refer to it as "The Fourth of July," not realizing that the whole point of the holiday is celebrating our independence from England.  Commercialized holidays bug me.  (Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Halloween, Christmas [now, in the 21st century]...I mean, come on now.)  I guess I'm bitter about Valentine's Day because nothing ever really happens for me, but Christmas is getting way too butchered nowadays.  I read something that said:  "Christmas isn't just about getting presents and egg nog.  The real background is Christ's birth.  CHRISTmas.  Get it?"  I was like, "whoa."  I think I read that in a Teen magazine.  It's funny how ignorant people are now, especially the teenagers.  Oh well.  It's really sad, though.  All teenagers are referred to as a specific demographic, fair enough, but when our knowledge is also referred to as common ignorance by adults, it becomes even more depressing.  In Time magazines and such periodicals, there are these statistics claiming that only a very small minority of 13-19 year olds know about what's going on in the world.  Talk about misrepresentation.    Anyway, I promise I'll stop turning my blog entries into editorials.  ;)   " The Best of Me ," by The Starting Line tell me what you thought about when you were gone  and so alone  the worst is over  you can have the best of me  we got older  but we're still young  we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up   here we lay again  on two separate beds  riding phone lines  you hear a familiar voice  and pictures drawn from memory  we reflect on miscommunications  and misunderstandings  and missing each other too  much to vow to let go   turn our music down  and we whisper  "say what you're thinking right now"   tell me what you thought about when you were gone  and so alone  the worst is over  you can have the best of me  we got older  but we're still young  we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up   jumping to conclusions  made me fall away from you  I'm so glad that the truth has brought back together me and you   we're sitting on the ground and we whisper  "say what you're thinking out loud"   tell me what you thought about when you were gone  and so alone  the worst is over  you can have the best of me  we got older  but we're still young  we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up   turn our music down  and we whisper  we're sitting on the ground  and we whisper  we turn our music down  we're sitting on the ground  the next time I'm in town  we will kiss girl  we will kiss girl   tell me what you thought about when you were gone  and so alone  the worst is over  you can have the best of me  we got older  but we're still young  we never grew out of this feeling that we won't  feeling that we can't  that were not ready to give up   we got older, but we're still young  we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up   I don't really like this kind of music (The so-called punk rock with bands that can't be distinguished from each other), but I kept seeing the music video and the song kind of grew on me.  By the way, the situation in the song has no relation in my life whatsoever.  God, I have no life.  He he he.  Goodbye.    PS- For some great insight on life, go to  urlLink Esin's blog .  To read about a girl on pseudo-cocaine, go to  urlLink Elise's blog .  (Hehehe)  And just go to  urlLink Tammy's xanga site .  The layout and the music is just so cool.

      Do you know what I really hate?  Of course I'm asking something that cannot be answered by the queried, but it's just for emphasis.  I hate leeches.  Yuck.    So...I drank a Coke mindlessly and it is now tomorrow.    " Love Song For No One ," John Mayer  Staying at home alone on a Friday Flat on the floor looking back On old love Or lack thereof After all the crushes are faded And all my wishful thinking was wrong I'm jaded I hate it   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here  (can you)  Searching all my days just to find you I'm not sure who I'm looking for I'll know it When I see you Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom just staying up all night just to write A love song for no one   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here   I could have met you in a sandbox I could have passed you on the sidewalk Could I have missed my chance And watched you walk away?(2 times)   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here You'll be so good You'll be so good for me   I'm done.  So now I will leave you with a random phone number: 713.530.3486  Ha ha.  And still I get no calls!  (Just kidding.  I am quite the shiznit.)

      This past afternoon I wanted to bake chocolate pretzels, so I stirred and mixed and rolled and kneaded and preheated and refrigerated and popped them in the oven.  So when they were ready, I took the fattening suckers out with oven mits.  THEN, a very terrible thing happened:  the 375 degree cookie sheet slipped a little and I caught it with my bare forearm.  Talk about third-degree burn.  Now I have a two inch long, centimeter-wide grayish welt on my poor, cute, little arm. :'(  It's all good.  It'll look cool if it becomes a scar.    Anyway, I just remembered something from my trip to Montreal this past June.  I was at McDonald's for breakfast and my family and I got Egg McMuffins and hashbrowns.  When I finish the hashbrown, I don't finish the Egg McMuffin, and vice versa.  Well that day, the case was that I didn't finish my hashbrown and ate the whole Egg McMuffin.  So I was sitting there at the small table in the semi-spinny chair connected to the table just watching all the odd French-Canadian people walk by.  I actually saw a dark-gothic, loving couple and the guy was wearing a long, black skirt.  I thought that was pretty odd, but I quickly remembered that I was in an odd world.  Anyway, back to the original story.  My parents were renting a car to drive to Quebec City and my big sister was in the bathroom, so I was stuck with my annoying, ill-tempered, premenstrual, little sister.  I saw another person pass by with a lot of bags.  He didn't look very clean-shaven, or, rather, clean.  He went to the trash can where I thought he was throwing away all his trash bags.  When I was getting ready to throw the 1/4 hashbrown I didn't eat, he came up to me and said, "Are you going to throw that away," and I said I was and he asked to have it.  I was so sad that I finished my sandwich instead of my hashbrown.  It turns out that he was digging inside the trash cans for scraps of food to eat.  I  hate  it when it seems like I don't care for the poor.  I don't have any money to offer to the poor on the street most of the time, and we just drive by the people who beg for jobs just to get food.  (**Heavy sigh**)  On a lighter subject, I've noticed that when girls have to leave, they say, "I g2g!"  But when guys have to leave they say, "I gtg."  Why a "t?"  I will never know.  I guess it's guy thing.  (This was pointed out by one of my friends, too.)  Now it's music time!  "Thank You,"  by Led Zeppelin  If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.  When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.   Kind woman, I give you my all, Kind woman, nothing more.   Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by.  My love is strong, with you there is no wrong,  together we shall go until we die. My, my, my.  An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look... see.   And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles,  Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one.  Happiness, no more be sad, happiness....I'm glad.  If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.  When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.  ____________________________________________________ Reduce your banana intake to one a week.

      Well, I know all of you are wondering about this next topic and will just read this over and over again.   Things that bug me:  -As I have mentioned in a previous post, I just hate it when people step on the back of my shoes or on my jeans.  Ugh!!  I don't know why this bugs me so much, but please, everybody, avoid it for the better of the universe. -When people try to sound intelligent by using words that aren't usually used in normal language it just bugs me so freaking much.  First of all, they don't  use them correctly, and second, they talk loud enough for everyone to hear their wrong diction.   -There was a kid in my English class who always asked me the same question over and over again everyday until he moved out of my class: "Hey Amanda, what do we do in Biology today?"  And that's all he needed to know from me.  I don't know if he was always trying to start a conversation or something, but it really annoyed me so I started telling him that she didn't collect the homework that day or "No, don't bring your book today," because if that's all ya wanna know, eat poo. -I hate it when people do the "|_|" thing with their hands at Good Charlotte or Avril Lavigne concerts.  It kills me. -Generalizations kill too.  That whole "Asians are quiet" thing in elementary school just scarred me for life.  In my classes I was the "quiet person," instead of "that awesome girl Amanda," which no one would ever say anyway, but, you know, I'm complaining here.  I mean, I'm not too shy, but I'm not "lol, OMG!"-outgoing, if you know what I mean. -Pessimistic doctors have no right to be in their profession.  If you know me, you know that I've hated my height (until now), and I've always complained about it.  I've had X-rays and they showed that I had a teeny bit of growth left (which was a half inch) and my doctor kept saying, "It's not that possible for you to grow three inches to reach five feet in time for your growth to stop," and I was all :'( and he was all :D.  I just went again last Wednesday and he asked if I'd grown and I said "A half inch," and he said, "The  last   half inch?"  I was shocked at his negativity, first of all, and second, I was wondering why he asked me a question like  that .  I mean,  hellOoOo,  I didn't want to be short!  But I didn't care at that time anymore.  People say things like, "You're cute like that," or "You wouldn't be you if you weren't short, so don't change," and there are other people who haven't seen midgets, or "little people," as they want to be called now, that call me a midget, which I don't think is funny or nice.  I don't waddle or have improportional limbs!  It's not that that's a bad thing to do or have, but I'm just 4'10," man. -That was long...anyway, there's one other thing that I can think of that bugs me.  CosmoGirl is a great magazine and yadayadayada, but they print there sad and embarassing and perverted stories with imagery that is too sexually graphic.  No one wants to read  that  much about a rape or a molestation!  It bugs me to think that people actually would.  A guilty pleasure of mine is to take weird psychological tests to find out more about yourself, like this one I took last night: I was asked to pick a color and use three adjectives to describe it.  I picked mauve and said it was different, unclassified, and pretty.  Then I was asked to pick and animal and describe it with another three adjectives.  I picked the Emperor Penguin and said it was small, cute, and adorable.  Results: The description of the color is how you see yourself, so I see myself as different, unclassified, and pretty.  The description of the animal is how others see you or what you think you're lacking.  I said the animal was small, cute, and adorable.  Go figure. That one turned out to be believable.    Now I will sing you a song... " When I Look In Your Eyes "  When I look in your eyes, I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes  I see the sadness of a thousand goodbyes  When I look in your eyes   And it is no surprise, to see the softness of the moon in your eyes  The gentle sparkle of the stars in your eyes  When I look in your eyes   In your eyes, I see the deepness of the sea  I see the deepness of the love  The love I feel you feel for me   Autumn comes, summer dies  I see the passing of the years in your eyes  And when we part there will be no tears no goodbyes  I'll just look into your eyes   Those eyes, so wise  So warm, so real  How I love the world, your eyes reveal ______________________________  Beautiful. -Amanda

      ¿Qué pasa, jugadoras?  I haven't posted in over a month, sorry.  I have just been sooo, incredibly lazy.    So now I'll mention a topic and argue about it.  Talentless pop-idol money moguls.  I really don't understand why Hilary Duff should go into singing.  I'm her age and I can sing a hundred times better than she can.  I guess if you want to sing about things you didn't write and haven't experienced  and  you don't want to play any instruments, you should sell yourself short like that.  I guess she has an okay voice, but I really don't think she should profit off of it.    -Manda

      I am so very tired today.  Sleep-deprived people are not the most energetic.  I hate this cycle: going to sleep at midnight because I can't stay awake to finish homework, waking up at six to catch the bus thirty minutes later, then falling asleep during chemistry, algebra II, and world history.  Then during the weekend, every thirty minutes I slowly drift off to sleep and wake up with a bruise on my head.  It's only the beginning of the freaking school year and man, am I already a living-dead-girl.    Anyway, off to another subject.  I hate it when something has run out-- forever.  Like extinct animals.  I just wish I could see a real-life saber-toothed tiger or maybe a dodo bird.  It's really upsetting, and I just think that I've missed out on something really cool.   I don't know why, but when someone is really good at something like performing, I think they'll never perform to their full potential if they know someone is going to hear.  (Like singing.)  :-\.    " Wasting My Hate ," Metallica Good day  How you do  When I send a smile to you Don't Waste waste your breath,  And I won't waste my hate on you  Ain't gonna waste my hate Ain't gonna waste my hate on you I think I'll keep it for myself  Ain't gonna kill no more Ain't got the time to help you score I think it's time you pleased yourself Yourself  Good day  How you do  When I send a smile to you Don't Waste waste your breath,  And I won't waste my hate on you  And I think your working now You think enough to even raise the brow And to life that tip that you belong Come on  When I see my hate I see my feet I feel that blood that pumps in me Where the hell's my mind Don't know Don't know now  Good day  How you do  When I send a smile to you Don't Waste waste your breath,  And I won't waste my hate on you  Then I'll keep it for myself Hate  Ain't gonna waste my hate But I don't clean it when they say Better to give then to receive  Ain't gonna waste my hate Ain't got time to waste my hate on you I think I'll keep it all for myself For myself  Good day  How you do  When I send a smile to you Don't Waste waste your breath,  And I won't waste my hate on you  Think I'll keep it for myself Yeah  Hate  ________________________________ This, too, shall pass.  -amanda-

      Today I came home and I ate a banana and two Kit-kats.  Then I went upstairs and watched Camp Jim.  I was planning to go to sleep at around 4:30 and wake up at 5:30, but while watching Room Raiders I drifted off to sleep.  I never fall asleep in front of the tv.  That is very odd.  I woke up at 7 and watched Gilmore Girls.  Finally Rory goes through something imperfect and real!  Awkward dates: how scary i think of them to be.    I am just having too much "me" time because I am finding out so much about myself.  A lot people think of me as "quiet," and not very outspoken.  Ha ha!  Those people are just the ones I never feel like talking to.  And sometimes I just don't feel like talking.  It's nothing personal.  I enjoy being alone.  I don't feel the need to introduce myself to everyone that passes and I certainly don't see the use in striving to "climb the social ladder."  I don't even like ladders.  I'm just a natural loner, if that makes sense.  It's not depressing either because I do have friends.  It's not like I shoo people away when I don't feel like talking, you know?  It's that simple.  I should go do homework now.  I should also try raising my GPA.  It's a frickin 4.4.  That's not very good, but oh well.    Have a day.  :-| -Amanda-

      I am so lazy.  It shows.  I don't do a lot of my homework, I don't bother studying, I hate doing chores (washing dishes, laundry), and I stay in bed 5 minutes before we have to leave for church and school.  Yeah.  It's really sad.  I think I might have gained a pound or two too.  Darn!  I am supposed to be on a diet but it's frickin Halloweenish time and my dad bought a buttload of candy.  Kit-kats, Snickers, Starburst, drooling excessively... Maybe this diet will start after October.  Wait- no, cause there's Thanksgiving.  After Thanksgiving.  (Whatever.)  Some say procrastination is laziness.  (Like my parents.)  But sometimes during procrastination, you end up being productive, so ha!  Contradicted!    My hair smells really good!  I wish there was some sort of scratch and sniff technology that could be incorporated into this website.  Unfortunately, there is nothing like that so you can't smell my hair.  (Like I would want you to!  Yuck!)  I wonder if anyone else could be as excited as I am when a new episode of Degrassi or Radio Free Roscoe is airing.  Channel 298 on satellite:  the best channel!  Hmm.. my favorite shows:  1) Degrassi  2) Radio Free Roscoe 3) Alias 4) The Newlyweds 5) Alias 6) As Told By Ginger 7) Even Stevens  Wow, I find out more and more about myself when I list things.   __________________________________________________ What is up with The Cheetah Girls??

      I am 13th chair (out of 16) in the All-Region Orchestra.  Joy.  And to think I just got that music on Monday.  I am so frickin proud of my wonderful self.  But the rehearsals, and those to come, are real time-wasting, butt-hurting, tiring, stupid pains.  It would have been so much better spent if I had my prodigiously talented yet jaded friend Tammy.  How her proximity consoles me.  I indulge in solitude.  Does that make me intellectual or antisocial?   ____________________________________________________  (It's rhetorical.)

      Well, right now I am being kept awake while my conscience tells me to finish my pile of homework.  It is literally a pile.  Of homework.  Unfinished.  And while my conscience is whispering, I am updating my blog and thinking of ways to waterproof my dollar-eyeliner.  Figures, considering the rebel I am.    I am supposed to be studying for Spanish, first of all, because I haven't even begun to translate the culture section we're being tested over.  I barely know how to spot the direct and indirect object pronouns, but cut me some slack here, for I am taught by a squawking parrot from Kentucky.  And she seems to be going through menopause.  Her accent is horrible, man.  I think she loses it by bragging about the years in college she's spent studying Spanish in between every sentence.  Wow, I am evil.  But I am also premenstrual at the moment, so cut me some slack.  And in chemistry, my goodness.  What is up with Miz Rushin emphasizing the second syllable of H2O?  Wa ter .  (Mind-boggling.)  Shame on me!  I have done nothing productive since dinner!  (That was a couple of hours ago.)  Time to go give my nightly shower concert.  Or countdown, perhaps.  My bathroom has the best echo. ____________________________________________________________  We're having the best weather this week.

      Oh my god.  I hate that stupid commercial for Foley's with the walking giftboxes.  They're all "Why is everyone staring?!"  It's because you're frickin WALKING, TALKING INANIMATE OBJECTS.  That is just the beginning of the commercialization of holy holidays.   Well, despite my viewing of that horrendous display of "yuletide humor," today was such a beautiful day.  You have never truly lived if you haven't splashed around in the Klein High School courtyard.  If it really floods, like  really  floods, the school administration should supply inflatable rafts and kiddie pools.  Oh, PARADISE...  Today, I have decided to be a jazz pianist/vocalist at high-class clubs in New York or Chicago.  I wonder what I'll be tomorrow.  A meteorologist, perhaps.    Mad tv was great Saturday night.  I just remembered the part where the girl turned into a werewolf when she had a craving to spend money.  Hahaha.  I know I might sound like a slave for the mainstream but Hilary Duff's performance on the AMA's was baaaaad.  Her voice track was playing so naturally you'd think she was gonna lip-sync, but instead she SANG ALONG WITH IT.  You could actually hear her trying to find the notes.  But I'm sure it was just nerves.    Shoot, it's late and I'm still wide awake with nothing to do or say.  I think it was that three hour nap I took when I got home from school.  Or maybe that Diet Coke I drank after dinner.  Or maybe just the thought of you reading this and the concept of me revealing my every thought to a total stranger...    Haha, WHATEVER.  I'm hyper and rambling.  Who are you?  I wonder...  I hate using this ellipsis... ____________________ Good night.  Or morning, afternoon, evening.  Whatever your case may be.  I wanna go shopping like a mofo.  AND I'm out.

      I don't know what's wrong with me!  I keep practicing piano like it's normal.  On Friday I came home and played for three straight hours.  Haha, whoa that looks scarier written.  I'm watching a boxing match right now.  Those cuts are nasty.  Hemoglobin and plasma and AIDS and sickle-cells and STD's... icky.  I don't want to be Leila Ali no more.  I actually did want to be a boxer at a time.    And Esin, come on!  You are NOT gonna turn into  urlLink Juan Moreno !  I really can't see THE Esin  running a KFC, and you know you're getting your feelings returned! ;)  (Or, at least I know, and everyone knows that my opinion is the only one that matters.  He he he..)  This has been stuck in my head: "I Think I Love You,"  The Partridge Family  I'm sleeping  And right in the middle of a good dream  Like all at once I wake up  From something that keeps knocking at my brain  Before I go insane  I hold my pillow to my head  And spring up in my bed  Screaming out the words I dread:  "I think I love you!"   This morning, I woke up with this feeling  I didn't know how to deal with  And so I just decided to myself  I'd hide it to myself  And never talk about it  And didn't I go and shout it  When you walked into my room.   I think I love you  So what am I so afraid of?  I'm afraid that I'm not sure of  A love there is no cure for  I think I love you  Isn't that what life is made of?  Though it worries me to say  I've never felt this way   Believe me  You really don't have to worry  I only want to make you happy  And if you say,  hey, go away, I will  But I think better still  I ought to stay around and love you  Do you think I have a case?  Let me ask you to your face:  Do you think you love me?  I think I love you!  _________________________________________ Darn boxing matches are so yucky.  Your lover, Amanda

      Hmm... It is exceptionally late right now.  I have not even begun to finish my homework.  Shoot.  Well there's always morning!  (In a couple of minutes.  Shoot.)    I've relapsed into this utterly annoying sickness.  I can't believe it.  I couldn't even remember the feeling.  Maybe it's because I've never felt this way before.

      It's Homecoming Week at Klein High!    Monday-Nerd Day Tuesday-80's Day Wednesday-What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up Thursday-Sweats Day Friday-Hawaiian (Spirit Day)  I don't think the people who dressed up for "Nerd Day" knew that they were making fun of the actual nerds.  And eagles don't sweat.  So I'm dressing going goth on "Sweats Day."  I actually want to be a pharmacist/doctor/struggling musician when I grow up.  Should I wear a stethoscope and a guitar?  (Heh heh, no.  That would be very sad.)  I'm not very school spirited.  I'm going to homecoming, but the night before I'll be at home at 7 pm watching Holes.  No, I am not going to the game with my date.  I'll skip the mindless cheering and stay away from the those two scary colors.  (Blue and yellow...*shudder*.)    Greek play today: A hilarious mess.  People should've paid to see it.  My role was to kill Prince Davidius.  Every killing needs a battle cry, right?  He he... ("You will pay with your life for what you have done!  EEEEE!!" *stabbed* [Fall dead.])  Ahh..haha.  Great stuffing.    I'm wondering if you can incorporate any html in this website...

      WHOA  I haven't done any homework.  I don't know why I call it homework anyway because I always end up doing it the day it's due at school.  Hmm.    Post-Lab quiz tomorrow!  Yay!  Another quiz that I can completely and totally guess on! Merheherherher.  (Weird laugh, won't happen again.)  I hate having 5 minutes in the morning to get ready.  It sucks.  I wake up, I turn my blaring radio down, and I sit there half asleep and stare at the minutes go by thinking I have forever to primp.  Then I realize I don't and jump out of bed and hit my head on my closet door.  It happens everyday.  Every single day.  Believe it.  SoOoOooOoo...

      I didn't eat breakfast.  I didn't eat lunch.  What does this mean?  I went to Chick-Fil-A afterschool today.  Why are their chicken nuggets so frickin small?    I came home around 4:30 and I watched Room Raiders.  I don't know why.  I think I was too lazy to change the channel.  I accidentally turned off the TV, so I left it off because I was too lazy to turn it back on.  I took a two hour nap in which I remember my dad yelling at me from my doorway complaining about my tornado-struck room.  Then I woke up at 6:30 thinking "Oh my frickin gosh I'm gonna be late for school!!!"  but really it was still today.  You should've seen me snap back into realization.  A funny sight.  And now I'm sitting in front of my computer staring back at this C-3PO Pez dispenser with no candy in it.  It's time for procrastination! __________________________________ The Anti-Gravity Boy is so cute!

      I had so much fun yesterday.  I got a big fat pen from my sister!  It has a little Hello Kitty kitty stuck inside of it.  I don't think I could run Sanrio.  I would have never thought of putting the kitty inside the pen.  And making it so fat.  Fat, fat, fat.  That word is worth a million pictures.    You know, I've become really insensitive.  I have nothing to look forward to.  It's a feeling without words to describe it because you don't feel anything.  Nothing.  But I do have nerve endings, so don't come up and start punching me; I'm talking about the emotional type of feelings.    "Devil May Care"  No cares for me I'm happy as I can be I learn to love and to live Devil may care  No cares and woes Whatever comes later goes That's how I'll take and I'll give Devil may care  When the day is through, I suffer no regrets I know that he who frets, loses the night For only a fool, thinks he can hold back the dawn He was wise to never tries to revise what's past and gone  Live love today, let come tomorrow what may,  Don't even stop for a sigh, it doesn't help if you cry That's how I live and I'll die Devil may care ____________________________________________ I really really like that song.    Apathetically yours.

      This is one saying I really can't stand:  "Good girls are bad girls who don't get caught [usually followed by some kind of winking emoticon]."    Good girls are good girls.  Good girls are girls who don't do anything to ruin their reputations or make it seem like they are "bad."  And if they do something bad, they are smart enough to cover it up.    Bad girls are just stupid.

      There's a girl in my Algebra 2 class who had a mental breakdown from boredom today.  I empathize with her like I do with little people (a.k.a. dwarves or midgets).  I mean, it's the same thing every single day.  I wake up stumbling and tired, go to school, and sit through every class.  I come home and sleep until dinner and stay up late doing homework, which makes me even more tired the next day.  The same exact thing every freaking day, except it gets worse as time passes.  Homework builds up, I get sleepier, the little sister gets more annoying, bed gets less comfortable...  I could go on and on.    So here's a seemingly unanswerable question: What cheers me up?  I have a list, don't worry. First of all, Frappuccinos.  They taste indescribable.  (Paradox!) Then there are those stores with the most amazing clothes. Playing jazz on piano. Playing Michelle Branch on guitar. Mexican food.  (Not just eating it, but the aroma and the presence of it is just wonderful.) The cute guys that turn my head when they pass me by. The cute guys that turn their heads when  I  pass them by. Compliments.  (The actual ones, excluding the ones about my clothes.) Friends and conversations with them. Nikka Costa, Thicke, Nine Inch Nails, and John Mayer. My pearly clips. The sight of [pretty] guitars. Alias, the show that airs on ABC at 8 pm on Sundays. And last of all, this song:  " My Happiness ," by Powderfinger  I see your shadow on the street now I hear you push through the rusty gate Click of your heels on the concrete Waiting for a knock coming way too late It seems an age since I've seen you Countdown as the weeks trickle into days  So you come in and put your bags down I know there's something in the air How can I do this to you right now If you're over there when I need you here  My happiness is slowly creeping back Now you're at home If it ever starts sinking in It must be when you pack up and go  It seems an age since I've seen you Countdown as the weeks trickle into days I hope that time hasn't changed you All I really want is for you to stay  I know I know I know what is inside _______________________________________ I need a break from normality.

      Hahaha.  That Juicy Fruit Strappleberry commercial cracks me up every time.  What about a flavor that's cranberry and apple?  Crappleberry!  Appetizing.  Wow, my hair smells really good.    I'm really tired.  I got a new cd yesterday!  It's funny how a thin little product of illegal labor can make me so happy, as opposed to, well, people.  People fail to cheer me up nowadays.  I think I've come to a reasonable conclusion.  I could be the most innocent and prude girl ever.  However, that was an extraneous statement.  What I mean to say is that teenaged guys suck.  I don't know why, but I seem to think that someone perfect will come around.  My perfect guy just completely blows all existing males out of the water.  Waaay out.    So Mr. Perfect Guy would be indescribable, but here are a couple of ideas: -He would have a low voice. -He would be able to sing well.  Really well. -He would be neither perverted nor prude. -He would not be profane. -He would have sensible style. -He would be unique and individual, and also respect that characteristic in others. -He would be faithful. -He would be at least 5'10". -He would single me out as someone very special to him. -He would not be conventionally cute, but a deeper kind of cute. -He would love me with all his heart.  And he's all I'm asking for.  If only this was a perfect world.  I might add to that list everyday.    Naptime is about now.    A song: "Goodbye To You" by Michelle Branch  Of all the things I've believed in I just want to get it over with Tears form behind my eyes But I do not cry Counting the days that pass me by   I've been searching deep down in my soul Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old It feels like I'm starting all over again The last three years were just pretend And I said,   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to   I still get lost in your eyes And it seems that I can't live a day without you Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light But it's not right   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time I want what's yours and I want what's mine I want you But I'm not giving in this time   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And when the stars fall I will lie awake You're my shooting star _______________________________________________ I'll be performing that soon.  Not that you'll hear or anything.

      I hate cute strangers, straight up.  Like when you're walking around a store and BOOM:  Mr. You'll-Never-See-Me-Again-But-Keep-Checkin-Me-Out bumps into you.  I  hate  that.    How I yearn for my  urlLink green  Fender.  Of course, the parents have to say no to everything.  I also hate that.  I wish love was less used to describe feelings because when you say you love something, you can mean like or adore, but not actually love.  It's just so cliché that it has lost its meaning.

      I have always wanted a trademark animal association with myself.  Well in my math class today, I was reading a biography of Boy George, innocently trying to decipher whether people in these pictures of his entourage were male or female.  Then all of a sudden a very credible person told me that I remind her of an otter.  Reluctant to thank her out of uncertainty of the comment's complementary content, I asked if I was like the "PB&J Otters" from the Disney Channel.  Fortunately I am not.  I am like a realistic otter.  So there you go!  Amanda the Otter.    So how did you like my avocado pants today?   And what are otters anyway?

      Bad news guys!  I'm not getting into Harvard.  I know, depression galore.    My report card is awful though!  I mean, I don't think I could've done any worse.  Unless, of course, I actually failed the classes, which some people actually do but it's never occurred to me because it still seems almost impossible.    So I got a gummy-spiked yellow lightbulb for Christmas recently.  I put it into one of the light sockets of the sink part of my bathroom which I use a lot and I don't want it to burn out.  It's really cool looking but I'll probably forget that I have it.  But every once in awhile I'll look up and remember that I have a really cool lightbulb.  Kinda like the person who gave it to me except he's not a lightbulb.  I like my new chemistry class.  I sit by Blake, whom I never really liked, but realized yesterday he's not that bad.  "Closer," Nine Inch Nails.  I would post it but it's a little inappropriate.  Disturbingly addictive and brilliant song.  You know why whenever you ask me if I have a celebrity crush I say I don't have one?  It's because I never remember them, and I can't have a crush on someone I don't know.  You weirdos!  _________________________________________________________ Is it just me or does Clay Aiken look really odd?  He also talks really oddly for a straight guy.

      So last night, or morning (because it was 12:30-something), I was thinking about when I was finally going into REM.  But that thought just keeps you up all night.    "Why are there so many  Songs about rainbows?" -  The Rainbow Connection , made famous by Kermit the Frog  That one phrase repeats over and over in my head.  Constantly.

      Something I've noticed about myself is that I always say the things I know people will want to hear.  Just everything but how I really feel to benefit the told.  I've been doing that for so long that it just comes out subconsciously.  So in a way, I'm always lying.  =\.    "I was afraid to be alone.

      I had never seen a dead person up close before yesterday.  I attended a wake for my dad's colleague, and I really didn't want to see the corpse, but it would've been disrespectful to walk past and not pay my respects.  So for the first time in my whole life, I saw a dead person up close and personal.  I didn't even know him, but the stories that were told in memory of him made me cry.  They also made me want to spend more time with my family, because he was a father of three young children and died so suddenly.  (I think I suggested to go to the movies tonight, but I went with my family.)  Then after the wake, I went to this restaurant downtown owned by my dad's friend.  He covered the check!  But this creepy girl waited our table.  She laughed at everything: When she dropped the fork on the table, when she quickly  popped her head into the bathroom and left, when we refused to not pay.  The laughing was actually annoying giggles.  And she pronounced "pudding" pooding.  Hahaha, it was so funny.  This entry's song:  " Back To You " by John Mayer  Back to you It always comes around Back to you I tried to forget you I tried to stay away But it's too late  I'm so good at forgetting And I quit ever game I play But forgive me, love I can't turn and walk away  Back to you It always comes around Back to you I walk with your shadow I'm sleeping in my bed With your silhouette  should have smiled in that picture If it's the last that I'll see of you It's the least that you Could not do  Leave the light on I'll never give up on you Leave the light on For me too  Back to me I know that it comes Back to me Doesn't it scare you Your will is not as strong As it used to be __________________________________________ And now I'm going to watch  Lost in Translation .  =)

      I seem to be losing everything I own.  First my most beloved cd, then my pearly clips.  What next?  I will develop an allergic reaction towards coffee.  Now that I thought of that, it's going to happen.  Darn, I should stop thinking of worst case scenarios.  Like today in chemistry we were burning peanuts and I was wondering what would happen to me if my sleeve caught on fire.  Well, the flames would spread across my paper-thin shirt and scorch my chest, back, and arms.  The class would sit back in consternation and do nothing because 1+1=11 [to them].  So while they stared, the fire would spread to my face.  Then my smart teacher would finally call for help and I'd be put out.  For the rest of my life, people would walk past me and stare at my hideous scars.    Unfortunately, my sleeve did not catch on fire.  Only the nut did.  Lucky nut.

      It has been a mediocre week so far.  Full orchestra lasted short of forever today, but you get that feeling when it finally ends.  Like finding something long lost.  My parents have been overusing the karaoke ever since American Idol started.  My parents do not sing very well.  Wishing for a power outage.  I would be asleep by now if it was yesterday.  Which reminds me of a dream I had.  God, it was weird, and I think it definitely told me something.  But how can a dream be so direct in explaining your problems?  I guess sleeping earlier means clearer dreams.    I wish my blog knew how to play songs.  But sadly, its owner is computer illiterate.  So feel free find your satisfaction in the lyrics.  " Lightning Crashes ," by Live  Lightning crashes, a new mother cries Her placenta falls to the floor The angel opens her eyes The confusion sets in Before the doctor can even close the door  Lightning crashes, an old mother dies Her intentions fall to the floor The angel closes her eyes The confusion that was hers Belongs now, to the baby down the hall  Oh now feel it comin' back again Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again I can feel it.  Lightning crashes, a new mother cries This moment she's been waiting for The angel opens her eyes Pale blue colored iris, Presents the circle And puts the glory out to hide _______________________________ My lyrical interpretation skills are improving.

      I lost my Hotel Paper cd.  ='(  That cd is like life support for me.  Oh well.  If it loves me, it will come back to me.  Then again, cds don't have feelings.  So I'm screwed.    Here's an awesome song from the wandering cd.  (My guitar song of the moment.)  " Til I Get Over You ," Michelle Branch  Everytime I feel alone I can blame it on you And I do, oh You got me like a loaded gun Golden sun and sky so blue We both know that we want it But we both know you left me no choice You just bring me down So I'm counting the tears 'til I get over you Sometimes I watch the world go by I wonder what it's like To wake up every single day Smile on your face You never tried We both know we can't change it But we both know we'll just have to face it If only I could give you up But would I want to let you off of this soapbox baby? We both know that we want it But we both know you left me no choice We both know that I'm not over you I'm not over you ____________________________________ Please pray that my cd comes back to me! I am ever so sad.

      It was abnormally hard to stay awake today.  I was nodding off while taking chemistry notes.  "1000 caloriasfndfncx equaallslaas a kilocalroiasdisjdv."  Hey, it makes sense to me.    Caffeine doesn't take effect on my anymore.  My sleepiness has finally overpowered that addictive drug.  No more night-mornings.  (Like when you stay up until 12am.)  I'm gonna miss those.  Diligence does not belong to me anymore.  Oh well.  I had it long enough.  " Life of Saturdays ," Dexter Freebish  I just wanna sail the seven seas and hide behind the sun, and never close my eyes, lay on my back and fantasize of the perfect place to be.  I wanna see the Mona Lisa, climb the pyramids of Giza on a moonlit night, yeah I just wanna fantasize of the perfect place to be.  I just wanna disappear and feel like I'm free at last, The time is right, my day has come, it's gonna start today, my life of saturdays.  I wanna see the seven wonders, feel the rolling thunder of a Spanish sky. Lay on my back and fantasize of the perfect place to be. I wanna swim the deepest ocean, be poetry in motion on a paris night I just wanna fantasize of the perfect place to be.  I just wanna disappear and feel like I'm free at last, The time is right, my day has come, it's gonna start today, my life of saturdays.  Go around the world in eighty ways. Never slow down, never fade away.  I just wanna sail the seven seas and hide behind the sun, and never close my eyes, lay on my back and fantasize of the perfect place to be.  I just wanna disappear and feel like I'm free at last, The time is right, my day has come, it's gonna start today  I just wanna disappear and feel like I'm free at last, The time is right, my day has come, it's gonna start today My life of Saturdays, yea  Oh where will I go Oh where will I go Oh where will I go ______________________________________________ That song makes me so jealous.  I want to live a life of eternal Saturdays too. =( Wow, that Elise is very bored.  30 messages in the past minute!

      Where did my impetus for living go?  It's so sad.  Nowadays I lose it as often as I lose my scrunchies.  I hope these words become important someday.  This is a pretty pointless read.  Sorry for wasting your time, because I know I have been wasting mine.

      Well I have my heart set on next week being a good week.  I hope it's a good week.    The Grammys are on tonight.  It's funny though.  When hip-hop is finally recognized, I dislike it.  Oh well.  I guess I won't watch this year.  All the annual TV broadcasts get suckier with time.  The last Grammys were good, though.  Music lifts my spirits like no person could ever.  Discovering all this "old" music is so refreshing.  I recently burned a cd for myself with a phenomenal compilation.  I have made five copies of the same cd because everybody likes it so freaking much.  Ahhh... I love my music.    " Hurt ," by Nine Inch Nails  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting I try to kill it all away But I remember everything  What have I become My sweetest friend? Everyone I know Goes away in the end  You could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt  I wear this crown of shit Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I am still right here  What have I become My sweetest friend? Everyone I know Goes away in the end You could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way. ____________________________ My silence is always to be taken personally.

      There is a strange sense of enlightenment in walking home in the cold.  Time goes by so fast, especially if you're walking in a straight line the whole time and you don't have to think.  The brisk air breathed in clears your mind and makes you happy.  Happy, happy, happy.  People keep petting me.  My velour sweater; my poofy jacket.  First it's complimentary, then after a little while it's a little disturbing.  Stop the touchy-touchy.  -Manda-

      I didn't get to sleep until 3:00 am last night because I was afraid that someone would chop my head off or something close to that.  I was reading a creepy book.  I type this as my heartbeat suddenly speeds up and as my forehead drips with sweat.  I almost shoved the book in my freezer.  (Yes, it is that creepy.)  So after a fun day at the mall with two of the coolest people, I am exhausted.  I sigh deeply.  It is the good kind of Spring-Breaky exhaustion.  Now it is time to go scarf down some pepperoni pizza.

      I really don't like drama.  Drama is annoying.  (And I mean the exaggeration of emotions kind of drama.)  So keep me oout of your problems and please don't complain to me.    I like things said to me with the intention of making me smile, although I'll smile either way because the muscular impulse has become reflexive to me.  Doesn't everyone like making people happy, not to mention  being  happy?  I adore happiness and I'll take however much I can get.

      Spring Break is only three days away.  A week of paradise after a week of hell (as I predict).  People from New England call their week of paradise "March Break."  Weird, isn't it?  Their Cokes are pops and their cools are wickeds.  But our southern dialect could be strange to them too.    So I found that Mrs. Stark is retiring after this year.  Can you imagine?  All those 125 years of Spanish study down the drain for some social security pension.  Or maybe she wants to go on a perpetual cruise.  That would be fun.  I don't blame her for choosing living on a cruise ship over teaching español.  I wonder if she can ever hear everyone bad mouthing her while she's writing on the board, because I'm pretty sure everything said is within earshot.  Oh well; she should've gotten the idea by now.

      Paranoia is the result of bad situations.  I don't think people learn from mistakes; they just become more cautious.  Holding yourself in the protagonist position all the time sometimes is selfish, but it is pretty much inevitable.    Blah, blah, blah.   I worry too much about everything.  It's about time to whip out my Venezuelan Worry Dolls and put them under my pillow!

      Suitors do not flatter; they annoy.    I yearn to view a horror film.  Dawn of the Dead.  Next week.  It looks so colorful and creepy.  I need to watch it.  Choppy sentences.  Kill my radio.  I wake up to it blaring in my left ear every morning and accidentally sleep through it, as loud as it is.  The songs haunt me in my sleep...  Silence is easy.  It just becomes me.  You don't even know me.

      TAKS testing week is weird.  Too much Spanish yesterday.  Yicky.  I have a weird craving to speak in Indonesian-sounding gibberish.  But I remain silent.    I have two poems to write for English.  A total of 30 lines, 150 words, 2 or 4 figures of speech, due Friday.  I need inspiration.  Or depression.    Listen to this  urlLink song .  It makes me sway and sigh.  So does the thought of the soon summer.  All we can do is wait.  (Counting down doesn't make it come faster!)

So I'll have to settle for this.  It's not too bad, actually.  (Oh yeah, this isn't important.  Read the below.)

      Rowdy raindrops run roughly round.  The thumping thunder thanks them, thinking thoughts that threatened thrice.    The on and off shower didn't calm or cheer me up, surprisingly.  A lot doesn't anymore.  My "favorite things" have probably changed.  But how inconveniently timed.  I need a pick-me-up, but I don't even know what that is now.  I'll have to try some new things to figure everything out.  Last night was so fun.  Taboo and Guesstures are so fun when your closest friends are playing with you.  Then the evil Mr. Midnight crept up behind us and brought everyone home.  Split-ends galore.  Unhealthy hair begs for haircut.  Haircut is not yet accomplished.  Man, I hate my inability to tell people what I want to say.  I know what I want to say, I know when I want to say it, I know how I want it to come out, but when I come face-to-face with a person, I dismiss my prepared statement due to the easiness of its exclusion.  I guess do this to avoid being disliked, but consequently, I depise my stupid self.    "We Never Change," by  Coldplay   I want to live life, and never be cruel And I want to live life, and be good to you, And I want to fly, and never come down, And live my life, and have friends around  We never change do we? No, no. We never learn do we? So I want to live in a wooden house  I want to live life, and always be true And I want to live life, and be good to you, And I want to fly, and never come down, And live my life, and have friends around  We never change do we? No, no. We never learn do we? So I want to live in a wooden house But making more friends would be easy  Oh and I don't have a soul to save, Yes and I sin every single day.  We never change do we? We never learn do we?  So I want to live in a wooden house, Making more friends would be easy, I want to live where the sun comes out. ____________________________________ You know what?

      Everything I encounter each day makes me rethink all the things I believe in.  It's amazing how quickly I can change my opinions about something or someone from the sight or sound of something accidentally convincing.  Revamping my thoughts isn't always a good thing, though, so the frequency of this occurrence somewhat depresses me.  (Lung-deflating sigh.)  "The Happy Ending,"  Phantom Planet   There's nothing for me here I'm starting to get old Time just ticks on We've all been taking some comfort in repetition And I'm left with no way to scratch  What has been itching and I'm I'm ready and waiting For the happy ending Now the days go by They pass right through us Our night lives make us so useless Now don't take anything to heart We don't care We don't want to start Well, I'm leaving for a while I'll head in some direction I just don't know which one I should be taking And I'm ready and waiting For the happy ending I'm begging and pleading For another beating I'm ready and waiting For the happy ending __________________________________ Inconceivableness is upsetting.

      Spring, Texas is a sad little dump.  I wonder how everyone came to live here.  I mean, of all places, you know?   My supposed cold, as opposed to allergies, is really getting on my nerves.

      I don't think I'm afraid anymore.  I just sleep with light and music on.  That's not too bad.  I've been avoiding any type of medicine to cure my coughiness in high hopes that I might develop a fever and miss a day of school.  Nothing's happened yet, but I wouldn't want to miss tomorrow, so abandoned plan.  My chemistry class makes me so mad.  On Tuesday we had a test and a sub.  The two supposedly smartest people in my class took advantage of this unlikely combination (You know, test + sub) and cheated.  It's not fair.  I did my best and did not cheat, which I could have done very easily.  They got high A's.  I didn't do so hot.  Anger...  Chocolate bunnies!! And plastic eggs!!! And stuffed chicks!!  (What am I getting at? Hmm.)  "Something is Wrong," by  Phantom Planet   Burn me down if that's how everything's gonna start With the flames from the heat off the look on your face On a day like today could have made out every  Raindrop falling down on your head  Now I fear that I may taste these tears rolling down my face  And realize something is wrong  With the light of the sun and the color of the sky  With you and everyone _______________________________________________ Steal the royalties from that band and download that song!

      I've been having those I'm-going-to-Hawaii-in-two-weeks feelings that make me exhale happy breaths every second.  It's been a good day.  Perfect dose of rain.  We finally finished our English project!  It's so cool, with rainbows and a weird story.  There's this blue sky with clouds fabric on our tri-panel/ stage that also makes me sigh happily.  =)  "Mr. Blue Sky," by ELO is stuck in my big head.  La la la...  [Radio announcer:]Warning! Todays forcast calls for blue skies.  Sun is shining in the sky  there aint a cloud in sight  it's stopped raining Everybody's in the play And don't you know it's a beautiful new day, Hey-hey Running down the avenue See how the sun shines brightly In the city On the streets where once was pity Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, Hey- Hey  Mr.Blue Sky,  please tell us why,  you had to hide away for so long(So Long), Where did we go wrong  Mr.Blue Sky,  please tell us why,  you had to hide away for so long(So Long), Where did we go wrong  Hey, you, with the pretty face  welcome to the human race A celebration Mr. Blue Sky's up there waiting And today is the day we've waited for, Oh-Oh  Mr.Blue Sky,  please tell us why,  you had to hide away for so long(So Long), Where did we go wrong  Hey, there, Mr. Blue, we're so pleased to be with you, Look around, see what you do, everybody smiles at you  Hey, there, Mr. Blue, we're so pleased to be with you, Look around, see what you do, everybody smiles at you  Mr. Blue Sky, Blue Sky, Blue Sky, Blue Sky, Blue Sky, yi  Mr. Blue, you'll get it right, but soon comes Mr. Night, Creepin' over, now his hand is on your shoulder, Nevermind, I'll remember you this, I'll remember you this way  Mr.Blue Sky,  please tell us why,  you had to hide away for so long(So Long), Where did we go wrong  Hey, there, Mr. Blue(Sky), we're so pleased to be with you(sky), Look around, see what you do(wo-oh), everybody smiles at you  Please turn me over __________________________________________________________ (I like blue skies, too.

      -That British lady who hosts The Weakest Link has such an annoying voice.  (Scrunchy nose.)  "Whose jelly donut ran out of filling?!"  Her shrill voice combined with her harsh accent makes it so hard to understand.  Ugh.   -I was so lazy when I got home: I watched Oprah.  Man.  It was about transgender children.  There's this cute little boy who wants to be a girl, but I think he'd be cuter as a gay kid than a normal girl.  I wonder what it's like to be transgender, what with the uncomfortableness in ones body and such.  (I have no desire to be male, by the way.  Silly cootie-carriers.  Yicky.)  I think Oprah has fascinating hair.  It's so poofed out and silky and shiny and wiglike.  You can't really see her scalp where her part is, so it could be a wig o_O.  One day I'll know for sure.    urlLink       what flavor pocky are you?    urlLink  [c] sugardew    -Yeah, Pocky's way too mainstream for me. -My contacts are really drying up.  Silly optometrist guy just popped into my head.  I'm not very fond of him.  He has pretty eyelashes, though. -I'm sleepy.  I have to write my whole critical review tonight.  I still haven't finished reading the book (Fahrenheit 451).  It's not long; I just keep forgetting.  I think it's because I have the less attractive cover.  You can totally tell what kind of person I am from the previous statement.  Sigh, I disappoint myself.

      Hey you readers!  Not many of you have been clicking in.  How do I know?  I don't.  Well anyway, sorry about the delay for the long-awaited next entry, which is this very entry!  So, I have realized that no matter how much harder I try to avoid some situations, it's inevitable because others, at their own free will, persist.  Stop!!  My Apologies about the vagueness of this paragraph.  Onto another subject:  (Disclaimer- This is rhetorical.)  Why do bad things always happen to me?  All the time, in everything I do, I know something will go wrong.  So I just set my standards lower to reduce the disappointment, but really shouldn't because it's like a self-fulfulling prophecy.  I do worse than I should and I guess I don't really realize that I actually have potential.  (This is like a failure's speech.  "You haven't seen the best of me yet!  I have potential and everything!")  Bluh.  Good news: (If you have not been keeping track and reminded so many times or counting down) Only 8 more days of excruciating pain!  (As in school, the torture chamber?)  Well I guess school isn't that bad, but I hate having that worry feeling in the back of my head saying "You had to do this last night, and now you don't have time!  You are stupid and ugly!"  Stupid.. head.. urgh.  Now I sit here listening to my LaunchCast Radio station worrying about the Spanish test over Future and Conditional!  Those words did not need capitalization.    Rest easy...  :)  “To My Magnanimous Friend”  It is pompous to whimper at a loss And become cumbersome and cross. But this resemblance does not appear,  As your bereavement was not a burden here. Pining for the presence of someone so beloved Confirms your altruistic intentions as in tears shed. And whatever creed may be yours He could be up above or return on all fours So feel free to flush your conscience clear For woe could not mar your tenacious exterior. All left to do is to reminisce and cherish Without lament and regret over the perished. ~5-10-04 __________________________________________ I love you!

      ..yes another.  (Entry, that is.)  I am unable to fathom the longevity of this month of June, and it isn't even over yet as we are still milking it and scraping the bottom, dreading July:  The First Indicator of the End of Summer.  Or maybe it's that sleep deprivation habit I have.  Either way, my stitches have already closed up and I've forgiven the coral reef and  still  June lingers and loiters as if it has not already been handed its Ice-Cream.  (From the Ice-Cream Man in the Truck.)  Then again, June  is  my birthmonth and even  I  would wait for my ice-cream to be given to me.  I like Ice-Cream.  In fact, I think Ice-Cream should be capitalized.  Now I will go back and capitalize every "Ice-Cream," even though you will not be able to tell if I performed as promised, but I will have to joy of the possession of integrity.    Buttered Pecan is my favorite.  The line in bold has been stuck in my head for the past day.  No parallels, unfortunately.  Go dig in the Loony Bin for drama, kid.  "Don't Get Down,"  by Phantom Planet   I want to live on the moon Never see a human again And when the earth explodes I'll light a candle for my dead best friends  I don't enjoy this place  My best friends are so mean   I look up to the sky when I am sad Because the planets don't get down on me I just want to fall asleep And dream of a place that's warm...

      Same old Driver's Ed today.  For some reason I'm always dead last waiting for someone to pick me up, but I live the closest.  Oh well.  I went compact disc shopping very hyperly and splurged on a very wanted compact disc.  I bought my sister New Found Glory's  Catalyst  bitterly, because it was $11.98 out of my birthday money and because I don't like New Found Glory at all.  I also purchased some healthy, hearty gummy worms.  Love personified.  Well, not quite.  I have to go to the gym and workout and become even smaller, yet buffer.  My goal is not to gain another tongue-twisting, alliterating, rhyming epithet, because it's your problem if you want to call me The Buff, Busy Bodybuilder.

      I wonder if there is some superhumanbeing that can actually read people's minds.  I wish I could read people's minds.  "Why doesn't he like me?"-- Zap, zap, beep, beep --"Oohh.  Tear."  Well I guess that's one of the cons of that superhumanbeing power.  I'm so subconsciously negative!    Driver's Ed is really boring.  As adventurous and youthful Mr. Walker may think he is, he's all the more soporific in a slow summer day kind of way.  When I walked into the Safe-Way Driving Centre, I thought I would know plenty more people because it's right by Klein and all, but I'd never seen anybody in that classroom in my whoooole life.  And today I will, once again, step into a strange, new classroom as I have to make up Lesson 6 at 6:30!    You know what?  The desk just vibrated and the ground just shook for 5 seconds due to a strike of lightning in close proximity, and with the odds of being electrocuted while using electrical appliances growing more than 1 in a million, I will have to end this entry now.

      Would it be weird if I sang like Barry White?  Ha ha, I'm imagining myself having such a low, promiscuous, seductive voice... hmm.  I just rediscovered my Barry White's Greatest Hits CD.  And my Spice Girls CDs.  We all went and go through necessary phases, but I still think those Spice Girls inserted some subliminal, hypnotic messages in their TV specials targeting small girls to buy their CDs and strive to be an altered version of Ginger, Posh, Sporty, Baby, or Scary Spice.  I liked Sporty Spice for some reason.  I was a very stupid 10-year-old.    I say that like I'm smarter now.  Pshh.  I'm still as superficial and ignorant as ever.  I'm thinking of painting my room bright yellow, dark red, or a light salmony melon color.  I think I typed this with the intent of a reader's feedback, but I don't think y'all care.

      I don't like words that end in "-ness."  It sort of invalidates the word.  I like "uniquity" better than "uniqueness."  But things don't change just for me, ya know.  I want to live in Honolulu in a house that makes your ears pop on the way to it.  I want to go surfing every weekend and befriend all the nice people there.  But alas, I am stuck living in Spring, Texas.  Poopie.

      Last night I had a dream that I really believed until I woke up. It was so scary, because sometimes I have dreams that call for eating, but I stop myself thinking 'My pillowcase won't taste so good,' knowing that I'm dreaming. But this dream was a thriller from beginning to end.  I woke up and randomly went to the doctor's to retrieved ultrasound pictures. They were of a pretty big and well-developed baby. Then it hit me- I'm going to have a baby. But I'm a virgin, so my mom was asking me who could've raped me, and I came to the conclusion that this mischievous kid in my driver's ed class named Ray, or something, did. (He's the scariest looking person I've ever seen.) I was afraid that I would have to abort the pregnancy, but being 4 months pregnant that wasn't an option, so I proceeded to worry about missing my junior year of high school:  I wouldn't be able to go to college... my future!!   Then I was startled awake by my alarm and whispered with a sigh of relief, "I'm not pregnant."

      Maybe they do.  But what if the whole "human" race as we know it is just a sham?  What if we're just two billion bacterial organisms thriving off of a giant, as we know it, animal carcass and we've only created a society out of things we can see?  I'll give you somethin' to think about.

       I found my password out for my screen name!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; It was really exciting, like finally finding your graphing calculator right before a math test, then figuring out that you have to use the school's calculator.&nbsp; But I can't see profiles on AIM Express, which is basically all I do online, but I am still online, unaffected.    &nbsp;    Like him.    &nbsp;  I'm stuck in a computer lab.&nbsp; It used to be cold in here, but I guess the temperature has gone up because there are a bunch of old men in here arguing about the advertisements for University of Houston.&nbsp;  Snore.&nbsp; Rumble in my tummy.     &nbsp;   I'm starving too.&nbsp; I guess looking at recipes for cherry pies on FoodTV.com doesn't help.&nbsp; Nope, it doesn't.&nbsp; I really need to eat a medium-rare burger with pickles and tomatoes and cheese and lettuce and mustard right now.&nbsp; Hungry, hungry hippo[patamus].&nbsp; Pretty, pretty princess.&nbsp; I liked those games when I was little.&nbsp; I would still today if I had access to them.&nbsp;  (Never wear the black ring... Wear the crown and you win!) &nbsp; As you can see, the Princess game appealed more to me when I was little (and maybe today) but more likely not today, because the word "princess" is reserved for spoiled toddlers, not to mention tacky shirts proclaiming extreme epithets.&nbsp; The European monarchs might as well be teenyboppers or first graders. &nbsp;     &nbsp;  I want a kitty.&nbsp; Oh look!&nbsp; I wish I could own that pretty kitty to the right.&nbsp; (Oops, haha.&nbsp; That's, like, me.)

       Maybe you were.&nbsp; I titled the last entry "Sigh... babies," and I forgot to mention something.&nbsp; Whoopsie.&nbsp; Well there is a commercial or SBC Yahoo whose theme is to connect people around the world.&nbsp; And there is an extremely cute baby that I want to babynap in the commercial.&nbsp; So when you guys are all grown up and you have babies, don't ask me to babysit because I might steal&nbsp;her/him if&nbsp;she's/he's&nbsp;extremely cute.&nbsp; That means if I haven't stolen it by the time you&nbsp;get home, yo&nbsp;baby's ugleh.    &nbsp;   And here I am listening to variations on "I've Got Rhythm" on NPR. &nbsp;&nbsp;   So... John Mayer&nbsp;has really big lips.  &nbsp;&nbsp;

       Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s car caught fire during the Grand Prix.&nbsp; Pshh.&nbsp; That's what you get for eating so much Fried Chicken.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "Well I must say, I'm solitary and quite merry."&nbsp; Wouldn't it be cool if girls said that instead of "I'm single and men are pigs."&nbsp; Pigs are the most intelligent animals, smart ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;I say the former if I'd have known it another way.&nbsp; Hmpf.  &nbsp;  I love Arrested Development.&nbsp; Maybe sometime next week you might see something worth reading.

      Sometimes you just wanna scream the f-word.&nbsp; But you can't.&nbsp;  &nbsp; But I'm talking about you, because I'm happy as can be yes I am. &nbsp; I've got an early drive-time tomorrow, and an appointment at my ghetto dentist right after!&nbsp; I actually brush and floss regularly now.&nbsp; Those dental hygienists are gonna get told tomorrow!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Winky winky KRBE.

      ...She wakes up.  And stuff from that Britney Spears song from long ago in the Stone Ages.  You know, if I hurt my knee, I'd still go on tour and sing while sitting instead of flat out cancelling the tour.  What a diva.  So how can I be so awake now but so sleepy just hours ago, but with no refreshing rest in between?  Mind boggling.    My little sister went to the Jessica Simpson concert for free last night.  (A few hours ago.)  So many popstars in this entry.  That's my fault.  I still haven't remembered the password to my screenname.  I guess a month left of not talking to a lot of people isn't much to endure.  Actually, it's pretty enjoyable.  And it's also pretty sad that AIM is an understood wave of communication.  I guess it was all too common without me knowing.  I think I'll stay up until 6AM and then sleep.  DOn't ask.  Actually you can't.  This picture of me in myprofile makes me so uncomfortable.  For one thing, it's not clear at all.  And I look unlike myself.  And vanity swallows my body.  *Sigh... What else can I write about?  I just thought about only having two years left til college and I got a good feeling in my heart/tummy or something.  You know?  It's like when you're reminded of someone you lOoOoOove.  Catch you later.

      I was listening to NPR (88.7 KUHF) on the way home yesterday.  The show that was on was about a girl's teenage life further complicated by a baby.  She sincerely said she served the all-too-typical story of "Boy meets girl, girl gets pregnant, boy gets busted for drugs and goes to juvy."  Ha ha.  Sure isn't typical here.  Airheads taste good.  Except for Mystery White.  What's up with Mystery White?  I want a donut.  Dough-nut.    My momma's in Chi-town.    Buh Bye.

      I'm starting to count Calories.  I just think it's fun: You get skinny and good at math.  The first signs of anorexia!    I started thinking about The DaVinci Code last night and I lost some sleepy time.  I don't know why I'm so afraid of that story.  I imagine that Mary Magdalene will chop off my head with an already bloody axe if I close my eyes.  I don't know why- I mean, you're supposed to be happy that Robert Langdon discovered where the Holy Grail was and it spoke to him and here I am trembling with fear.  Weird.

      I've got a picture up!  It's not really that exciting because I have already posted pictures, then took them off because I felt a little insecure about my face being out there for everyone to see, negating the ultimate anonymity of a blog, although other "bloggers" would beg to differ.  I think I've already explained this insecurity.  Moving on.  What is this sudden obsession over wanting to go to a concert soon?  I don't know, but I feel like I have to go to one or I'll die.  But I won't; I'll just deteoriate into a breathing blob, but that would be cool.  I'm not saying that not going to a concert would benefit me; I'm begging you to take me to a concert!  (Thanks for picking up on the hint!  [Even though you couldn't respond anyway.])

      I can't remember the password to my AIM screenname.  I changed it because I have recently developed a suspicion that someone might be signing on and talking to people on my buddy list as me.  And I forgot what I changed it to.  Oh well.  I never go online anyway.  I never talk on the phone either.  I just figure that if I run into a friend somewhere, we were meant to hang out or something, you know?  Why initiate something and plan and plan when you can just run into a fun situation?  That's what I think.    So this morning my sister runs into my room as I am combing the Spray-In conditioner I bought instead of a David Sedaris book last week and says, "Manda!  They're giving away John Mayer/Maroon 5 tickets on 104!"  So naturally I get really excited and call in and wait for 10 minutes on the phone as it rings while I squirm into my pants only to hear, "Sorry, we already have a winner."  Oh well.  Like I was going to win anyway.  I haven't been to a concert since May 10, 2003.  Lung-deflating sigh.    These were beautiful until they died.  Like everything else.

      I hate having obligations.  (Like schedules.)    I wish I could do whatever I wanted to.  Gosh.   My List of Movies I Want To See Soon:  Kill Bill: Vol. 2 Super Size Me Saved! Coffee and Cigarettes Spider-Man 2 Napoleon Dynamite The Village King Arthur  That's $52.00 at the movies.  But MiniSkirt + StreetCorner= $0.00.  (Heh, heh.)  PS- I don't own a mini skirt.

      I just woke up.  I think I fell asleep because I was watching a very boring tennis match (Ancic vs. Roddick).  The whole time I was just cursing at Roddick for dumping Mandy Moore.  I hope he loses.  Croatians will soon rule the world!  I posted a picture of myself last night, but I took it off because I felt insecure about putting my face out there for everyone to see.  Rationalizing my insecurity ain't helping.  Oh well, I'll look for a better one soon enough.  In the meantime, enjoy the music.

      Awake in a might-as-well-be empty house.  It's so quiet that I cannot tell the difference between my computer's hums and crickets' leg rubbing.  Exciting!    I went to Barnes & Noble and spent 2 hours there with my sister.  A cute stranger seemed to be retracing my path at a few turns, or that might've been me vainly protagonizing.   I browsed the classics, chick books, poetry, modern plays, paperback bestsellers, David Sedaris, and memoirs until I realized I would not have enough money to buy Spray-In Conditioner if I bought  Barrel Fever .  So, for the sake of saving my head from alopecia, I sacrificed quality laughter inducing reading time.  Narcissistic.  I can't believe I actually failed the test on alcohol in Driver's Ed.  Whiskey, reaction time, DWIs, $2000 fines: way too much to be packed into my relaxed summer brain.  I need to sleep!

      I want this blog to look cool, even if only three people read it.  It would be so much more interesting if the template was more colorful... but not like Alice in CreepyLand.   Is that mushroom blood on her apron?  I don't wanna know... Mario Winan style.  So I guess my search for an interesting template continues.  Check back later.

       I think the people next door are watching something X-rated. Their laughing and clapping is getting annoying.       What's it like being in a room facing a slightly tinted window in which people stop in front of to check out their smiles while talking on cell phones then realize startlingly that a little unappreciating girl is on the opposite side seeing everything and irritated? Annoying.    I wish someone would invent a complex enough teleportation system to get me to a mall already. It's the 2000's, people. Come on.    Relax kitty!     Miz Martin is much less intimidating over the phone, so call her by Friday to make schedule changes, kitty and students Rj- Sw!
