      Having a nightmare with Goldmine.  With the Microsoft Word link installed, Word crashes every time I try to close it.  Remove the link template, and shuts down fine.  Aaargh!

      Well, sort of.  I have put a coat of clear primer on the dinghy's hull.  It has soaked in incredibly quickly, but it should mean the undercoat will soak in less.  Hoping to have another bash tomorrow night, but maybe I should be home before the kids go to bed, as their behaviour tends to deteriorate when I'm not here, and Carol gets the brunt of it.

      Just broken a tooth.  Phoned the dentist, who said they had de-registered me.  There are no dentists in town taking new patients.  I am now on a waiting list of 8-10 weeks for emergency treatment.  And for this I pay all this tax?

      The house purchasing stress levels increased yesterday, as the seller refused to reduce the price to allow for us to carry out remedial work.  We wanted 7K off; in the spirit of comprimise I said we would accept 5K off.  They said no, only 3.5K.  I told them to get stuffed.    Anyway, the valuer who originally dealt with the seller has phoned her and told her not to be so stupid, and they are now going ahead with the 5K reduction.  Carol took some pursuading to go ahead though, she had taken a major dislike to them for messing us about.

      After a day and a half away on business, I return to work today to find that peoples job descriptions have changed, one person has handed their notice in and lots of people are falling out with each other.  No change there then!

      We are about halfway through the process of moving house.  We've got our mortgage approved, and had the survey done.  This resulted in having further checks carried out on the wiring and gas appliances, plus checking for damp.  This has resulted in us asking for Â£7K off the price!  We are waiting for a response on that.  In the meantime, the solictor acting for our buyers has spotted that we don't appear to have permission from the freeholder for the extension.  The extension had been built by the previous owners, so our solicitor should have spotted this.  We are now having to apply for permission retrospectively, and I have told the old solicitor I will be charging our costs to them.

      Spent a happy evening yesterday having a barbeque and then playing swingball.   This went well until I somehow managed to hit myself on the knee with the hard plastic bat - ouch!  I even managed to draw blood.  Being the brave man I am I promptly collapsed on the floor, but I didn't get much sympathy.

      Once again we were woken at 6:15.  He doesn't do this when he's got to get up for school.  We have to drag him from his bed then.    We had a late night anyway, watching the  urlLink Eurovision Song Contest .  I picked the winner, Ukraine; shame I didn't have a bet on it.  Terry Wogan referred to her throughout as  urlLink Xena Warrior Princess.     Take a look at the pictures and make your own mind up.   The voting as usual, was horrendously biased, with Greece and Cyprus giving each other top marks, and the Balkan states all voting for each other.  Russia and Ukraine also supported each other.  You can't say it is because of Language, because nearly every act sang in English.  Terry Wogan commented on the voting frequently.  He wants the EBU to take a hand.  Unfortunately, I don't see what they can do, because this time the voting was all telephone votes by the general public.

      What a horrendous day.    The morning wasn't too bad for me, as I was off working on the dinghy.  From lunchtime onwards it went downhill fast, as Christopher has been dreadful all day.  A victim of his own early morning, he has been tired, grumpy and demanding, whinging constantly.  Good points - we bought some books for the kids, and Susanne has quite happily started reading a childrens novel, no pictures at all.  Christopher is reading Dr Seus.

      The animals are eating, and peace and quite reign for a short time.  I'm sure it won't last long, but it's nice while it does.

      6:44 on a Saturday morning and I've just got up.  Christopher woke us at 6:15, we sent him back to bed, but we couldn't get back to sleep and he woke his sister up.  Decided to get up and leave Carol in bed to see if at least one of us can get some more sleep.  I had a late night anyway last night, as Blade was on TV, and didn't finish until 12:20.  I'm shattered.  Good film though.

      Another week over.  Going to be busy this weekend working on the dinghy.  Carol is taking kids away to her parents' holiday cottage.  Very brave of her.  I'll get to watch my new DVD, The League of Extraordinary Gentleman.  Not Carol's scene really.  Youth theatre in the morning for the kids, we get to do some chores whilst they're out, then off they go and I get stuck in to the dinghy.

      Once again we break new ground in effective and efficient staff management.  The Sales Director has just "reminded" us all that there is a training day next week.   This is no reminder - she never told us in the first place.  Some people have made appointments, and so they won't be available. This of course will be their fault.

      During his short time in the office yesterday, it appears the MD managed to upset nearly everyone in the office.  This morning has been spent trying to undo the damage.  His intentions are always good, but the way he goes about it leaves an awful lot to be desired.

      The weather is improving - you can always trust an Englishman to talk about the weather :) - shame I'm planning to spend the weekend in a garage working on my sailing dinghy.  Its a 50 year old GP14, all wooden construction.  My father-in-law (Doug) has done loads of work on it, and I've assisted wherever my meagre abilities allow.    1.  We stripped all the paint off. 2.  After stripping paint off we decided we'd wasted our time, cos the hull was damaged under the paint and needed replacing. 3.  Removed all hull, deck and centreboard case. 4.  Rebuilt centreboard case. 5.  Replaced a couple of broken ribs. 6.  Fitted new hull (great fun trying to twist plywood through 90 degrees, but we got there), 7.  Sanded off all the bits of glue that had run when sticking the hull on. 8.  Fitted new deck. 9.  Filled in all screw holes. 10. Sanded all hull and deck.  Now need to go back and fill a few screw holes I missed, sand it all down again and then start painting.    We've been at this nearly 12 months.  Hopefully it will go in the water this summer.  There is an interesting site following the building of a new GP14 from a kit at  urlLink GP14 Building .  Turns out that Mike, the guy building it lives within half a mile of my father-in-law's house, where we are working on our boat.  Wish mine looked as good as his, but then again, he's probably spent 10 times as much on it as I have.

      Meeting over - customer accepted my explanation.  Dealt with a couple of service issues and generally have a happy customer.  The director there actually took my side over the General Manager, which was nice.

      Been looking at the trailers for  urlLink Troy  - looks very spectacular - huge battle scenes like the Lord of the Rings.  Speaking of the Lord of the Rings, Orlando Bloom has done rather well for himself.  From unknown to starring rolls in Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Carribean, and now Troy (plus a british film, the Calcium Kid, about a milkman who becomes a boxer).  Quite a compliment to him, being cast as Paris - according to myth the most beautiful man in the world.   Nice to see a new, young british actor making it big in major films.     I would put a link in for Orlando, but there doesn't appear to be an official site, and the number of fan sites is incredible.

      I'm beginning to feel like I should be moving to Canada - another  urlLink Guy Gavriel Kay  fan has popped up, again originally from Canada.  Am I the only person outside Canada to like his books?

      Get to leave home a bit later today - meeting is at 9:30, and is only 45 minutes away, so get an extra hour.    I think I'm prepared - I've got copies of the invoices as they should have been - I'll credit the wrong one and re-invoice, then hopefully all future ones should be ok.

      I''m calling it a night.  I'll have a glass of wine then off to bed, trying not to wake Carol up when I go.  We're both shattered at the moment, with stress at work and kids refusing to let us lie in at the weekend (and refusing to get up during the week!).

      Preparing for a meeting with a big customer in the morning.  They want me to explain their invoices.  This would be easy if their invoices were how they were supposed to be, but for whatever reason, the corrections I made to their account just before the last invoice run are now not there.  I've got to go and eat humble pie and say sorry, we'll credit this one and re-invoice.  I hate meetings where I go in knowing we're in the wrong.  The guy I meeting with is a nice bloke though, I just hope his sidekick isn't there, he's a pain in the backside.

      I am amazed to discover that I am one of only three people using Blogger to list the  urlLink Fionavar Tapestry  as one of their favourite books.  The others are  urlLink Dakuma,   and  urlLink Kate Morris,  with the excellently titled Blog, "Title in use, select another."  The others are both from Canada, which is both the home of the author, and where the book starts (after the prologue), leaving me the odd one out, being English.  I would recommend this trilogy to any fan of Tolkien or Arthurian myth, and then once you've read that, move onto Guy Gavriel Kay's other excellent books.

      We've got agreement on using  urlLink Goldmine  for logging sales.  Richard, our  urlLink PFY  , gave an excellent presentation, and got agreement from both the Sales Director and the MD that we should go ahead.  Now we've just got to train everyone involved, and then make sure it's done.  No problem!

      Spent the morning working on producing a more professional image when we send out quotations; simple things like consistent fonts, using continuation stationary rather than plain paper, a well written letter without trite phrases such as "assuring you of our best attention at all times."  What the f*** does that mean anyway?  We've been down this road before, but today we are doing it formally, with examples, a presentation, and support gathered from some key players beforehand.   If we get the go-ahead we'll set up all the templates, standard letter etc., but I'm sure someone will go off and do their own thing anyway!  We're good at re-inventing the wheel here, with half a dozen people all doing their own variations.  We're also attempting to have the sales team log everything they're doing on  urlLink Goldmine  (CRM software).  This has also been tried before, but now the MD wants it done we might stand more of a chance.  Here's hoping...

      My daughter Susanne is busy rehearsing for a play taking place at Youth Theatre.  Hope we don't end up like Sally Webster in Coronation Street, pushing her into things.  Susanne is very strong willed, and I am certain she will make it very clear if she doesn't want to carry on with this.

      Do I continue my usual practise of carrying on working, or shall I walk up to the shop to get something to eat?  I think I'll probably end up doing both.  Just received a memo from the MD.  He's been off sick for a while, and has just received a report on cancelled contracts.  He has decided that none of his staff are capable with dealing with a cancellation, and they must all go to a director.  Doesn't that make you feel good to work here?

      We're currently working at cutting costs across all areas at work.  We've made cuts in production and transport already.  Today we got a phone call from our Managing Director, saying he "needed" a laptop to download emails, and a new mobile phone.   He already has a Blackberry for getting his emails remotely, but it doesn't read attachments, hence the laptop.  Our   urlLink PFY  foolishly said, "We've got this old one here you can have", thinking, quite rightly, that no great deal of power was required.  This got the immediate reaction of "Oh no, I'm not having an old one, I need a new one."    If we had just given him the laptop he wouldn't have known the difference, but now we're spending 600 quid buying a new one when we had one that would have done the job anyway!  So much for cost cutting.

      Successfully installed  urlLink Cooperative Linux  on top of my existing Windows installation.  Worked at the first attempt.  This enables me to run Linux at the same time as Windows on one machine.  I can then use X Windows via Cygwin.  If I run X rootless, each Linux application runs in its own (Microsoft) Window, enabling me to switch between Linux and Windows programs at will.  It does slow things down, but its a great way to run your favourite Linux applications without having to reboot.

      Party this weekend, but haven't bought him a present yet.  He said he wants two rechargeable batteries.  Not terribly inspired.  We're planning to get him some sort of garden toy, but haven't found anything suitable yet.  Two days left to sort it!

      SCO appear to have settled their dispute with Baystar.  They have given Baystar 2.1M shares of common stock.  However, this is only worth 25% of their initial investment.  For some reason the stock market seems to think this is good news and SCO shares are up 18%!  I just don't understand how these people think.

      New delivery rounds start next week - I'm not quite sure how I first got involved in this, but it now appears to be my baby.  If it goes well, thats just how it should be, if it goes wrong, I carry the can.    Hopefully it will go well, we've done a lot of planning to get to this point - just need cooperation from the drivers.

      We moved house last weekend.  Had our tea at midnight on Friday, worked from 7am to 7pm moving furniture in on Saturday.    We are now starting to get unpacked.  Need to decide where we want the kitchen so we can decide where to build a wall and where to get the gas piped too.  Got a frustrating wait for the broadband connection to be activated.  The exchange isn't being adsl enabled until 7th July, and our activation could be up to 2 weeks after that.
