      When I look in the mirror first thing in the morning, like when I'm brushing my teeth, I see my mom's face which is a little disconcerting. During the course of the day my face comes back to being my face but that first look of the day is a little freaky. Don't get me wrong, I love my mom but she's, well...old! I'm not ready to look/act/feel old thankyouverymuch. Ugh.

      Are men incapable of either loading or emptying a dishwasher? Seriously, like it would take so much more time to bend at the waist and put the plate in the dishwasher instead of leaving it to fester in the sink. Is there some weird sequence on the Y chromosome that makes dishwashers invisible or something? Someone please tell me what the deal is.

      That's funny that you should bring up the concept of  urlLink "no" means "no"  because I've got a hanger that I cannot flick off.  Why is it that when I tell a guy that I don't want to go out with him that he feels a need to logically reason with me why I should? As if I was just mistaken and deluded before and now that he's shown me the light I'll realize that I really did want to spend more time with him than I already have to.  It doesn't matter that I don't date guys in the first place. It doesn't matter that it may not necessarily even be a date (even though I totally didn't believe you when you said that). It doesn't matter that we work together.  It doesn't matter  what  my reasons are.   What matters is that I said &mdash; repeatedly &mdash; that I am not interested in hanging out with you. So back off, buddy. Sheesh.

      Has anyone else noticed the increase of seduction/rape scenes in big budget movies? Take Troy for example. The love interest of Achilles has a knife to his throat, ready to kill him when he seduces her and they make love for the first time. And every sex scene in Unfaithful was overly aggressive to put it lightly. I really hate this kind of shit. Sex and violence are two completely different things and should not be mixed unless it's agreed upon by two adults prior to jumping into (or being pushed onto) the bed. I just worry that some numbskull is going to think that women like to be slapped around and that "no" is a term used in sex play and doesn't mean NO!

      This is so sad, this police department in the hospital where my brother was helped me so much. I had to get them to serve the papers to my brother.... So I've been seeing many of the officers that work there on TV regarding the loss of their Captain.  Its odd to see them on TV.  Isn't it weird how small the world can be sometimes.   urlLink NBC 4 - News - Police Captain Shot To Death While Riding Bike

      I gave my mom a cat a few years back. She was very sweet and fluffy and beautiful and had been in the shelter 2x when I adopted her for my mom. Mom was thrilled and loved her and had me do a lot of free cat sitting when she was out of town. Well, mom's bf didn't like the cat and mom decided she didn't want it anymore so instead of working to get it a new home, she dumped it at the Animal Shelter where it will probably be put down or traumatized further for being abandoned. It makes me so mad.  You know, mankind domesticated an animal, there was an implicit promise that we would take care of the animal as we made it impossible for that species to take care of itself sufficiently, especially after we declaw (or whatever) the poor thing. For me, a pet is like a member of the family. God, you know, it makes me wonder if I had been a willful child if she woulda dumped me off somewhere. Once you take the responsibility for a living thing, you MUST see it through! I don't care if we are talking about a fricken guppy! I really wonder sometimes how I can be so compassionate and she can, at times, be totally lacking in compassion. Maybe it was a recessive gene that skipped several generations or something. I just don't get it.
