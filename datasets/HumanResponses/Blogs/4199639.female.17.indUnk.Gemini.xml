      the old cop that lives next door officially scares the crap out of me.  - he mows his lawn EVERYday at 8am.  - two weeks ago he started playing really loud music. it was like old 60's music.  - today he woke me up because of his extremely loud and depressing opra music.  - he's always in the garage. with his loud music. and he's weird. and he scares me. anyways. i found out some bad news. i can't go to san diego anymore because we don't have enough money. so my mom is just going to her conference and coming home. i was SO excited!! i want to cry. but then my dad called this morning -random because he never talks to me- and said 'want to go to the carribbean with me next january or february for a week?'. and i can bring a friend. YAY.  then i went to the bank. and while i was backing up - i dented the car. woo hoo. go me. i suck.  have a nice day.

      so lets see...  today i woke up, had breakfast, showered, went outside and tanned for a bit... then i decided to call the buckle back since they called me while i was gone. mike -the manager- wanted to schedual an interview, i said i was free for the next two days. so he said ok, see you at 2:00. it was 1:00 at the time, and i looked all crappy from being outside tanning, and i was freaking out because i was not prepared. i have never been to a job interview before. i couldn't find any good shirts to wear because i haven't done my laundry in like 5 thousand years. ugh, anyways i made it there ten minutes early, he said that was good of me. then we walked over to a bench right outside boston store to hold my interview. it was awkward. i thought we'd at least be alone in the back room of the store or something. but no. so...i had like a hundred brain farts and coudln't think at all. he kept asking me questions and i kept saying 'um...'. it seemed to be going pretty not so ok. then he asked me who's style i looked up to, who i admired for their clothing. then it got worse. because i couldn't think of one human on the face of the earth. i ended up saying kate hudson after like ten minutes. god i must have looked like such a retard. but i just couldn't think! but ah, i must be way too hard on myself. because at the end of the interview he said he liked me alot, but the only thing he was hesistant about was that i come off as being a little shy. UGH me and my shyness. it never goes away. anyway, he schedualed a second interview with me on sunday at noon. so thats a good sign. i have a feeling i will get the job. he was cool. the job sounds fun. i like the clothes there. AND i get 40% off everything. hah, yesss. 40% off Lucky jeans is great. yay.  anyways, i'm sure that little story bored you to death, if you even read the whole thing. hm...i have some nasty tan lines from camp. i have to work on those tomorrow. i hope its sunny.  i'm going to san diego in september and i am so so so so so excited. i can't stop thinking about it. i'm also excited to go to chicago on friday. but hm.   so my mom wants me to consider the university of arizona -tuscon-. i could go there and pay resident price because kevins sister lives there or something, and i'd use her address? lol...i dunno. that'd be pretty cool. they have a dance team, and its a good art school i hear.   i need to see guster in concert again. soon. i have a craving to see them. like right now.  ...well i got nothin else. <3

      band camp was fun. it went by pretty fast also. although i don't like it when band parents think that guard girls are demons waiting to kill each other. a harmless nice little prank that was supposed to last like ten minutes, turned in to a two hour drama. because yes, we wanted to hurt the freshman. really we did. not. who do they think we are? ugh. FRUSTERATING. anyways...i got tan/kind of burned. which surprised me because it was freezing the few days before we left. i guess the buckle called me while i was gone. i suppose i should call them back. but i don't want a job there. i want the job at the gap that i applied for. i really shouldn't be picky...money is money. me and my mom are going to chicago from friday - saturday. mainly to shop. but saturday morning we're going to meet up with katie and her mom to tour depaul. that should be fun. all this college stuff really stresses me out, and i don't like it. i think i'm going to do that early admissions thing. for depaul you have to apply by november 15 or something? i dunno, but i guess if you do it they pay more attention to you. so, i got a comment on my drawings that i posted on my blog from a random guy. that was nice. i really wasn't expecting that.   anyways...i'm pretty tired and can't think of much else to write at the moment. except that i'm a procrastinator and i need to start working on my portfolio assignments. psh.

      i'm feeling a little better tonight. i had fun actually. during the day i dropped off my application for the gap. and yesterday i turned in my applications for american eagle, and the buckle. the buckle said they'd call me today - they never did. i just want a job where i can get discounts on clothes, free mcdonalds food just doesn't cut it for me. whatever. anyways - me and katie saw the princess diaries II tonight. the reviews sucked - i thought it was a good movie. except, holy a lot of estrogen in the theater. there weren't ANY men in there. except for one. and he sat behind me...and he tapped his foot on my seat, and he was haukin phlem the whole time. gross. oh and it stank real bad in there by the way. then we went out. i ate donuts. and felt fat-again. ah, you know whats fun? how i'm addicted to channel 71 (the style network), channel 67 (the food network - i like this channel because sometimes 'iron chef' is on. and its real funny. cuz they all really talk in japanese or whatever, and the american translators for the show have to put all the same emotion in to it as the japanese people talk. its just funny. watch it sometime. and they cook gross food.) annnd i like channel 74 (discovery health channel - because i'm weird in that i like watching gross surgeries...like plastic surgeries - before&afters.). yeah. thats it. hmmm oh god, right now i'm watching the show about the lady that had the 200lb tumor on her side, and the surgery to get it off. its disgusting. i'm WEIRD. so band camp is this weekend - thats fun. although wow, why is it like negative 5000 degrees? usually we get tan, this year we'll probably be wearing sweatshirts. ick. so the puma pants that i bought on sale last week...were in the princess diaries II movie we saw tonight. mia's friend was wearing them. i forgot what her name was. but thats exciting. i'm obviously running out of things to say. so...bye.

      why is it that everyday its like i ate a brain tumor for breakfast? i can't think anymore and its really weird. maybe thats just because everything has been extremely stressful lately. i don't know. but it sucks when your own mom hates you constantly, and you feel like your no good. and you already have pressure on you because you feel like you have to make her happy because your her only child and you need to be perfect and you have to do everything right and you don't want to let her down. and your jealous of every human being that has a sibling - and want to scream at them because they don't know how damn lucky they are. and then you look in the mirror and you don't like what you see, then you talk on the phone with certain people who want answers from you on certain subjects and you can't give them answers because you can't think. then you end up crying almost every fucking night and in the end ....you really don't know why. at the end of the day...things don't make sense. why did everything end up like this? and how am i going to get myself out of the messes i've made? i haven't made that deep of a hole, but the fact that i can't think anymore really sucks. i am very mentally drained. i dont' know what i need, but i need something. ....um, well that venting session sure did make me feel better. hm.
