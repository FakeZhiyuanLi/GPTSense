        urlLink J. Isaac  at First Avenue Tuesday December 30th, 2003   Nick and I went down to First Avenue to bundle comp tickets in advance of the big New Year's party. The whole place was crawling with teeny boppers even though it was a 21+ show. The music was just awful. Some weird ass dancers were the openers. Got drunk off my free drink tickets and hung out while the machine was churning out tickets.   We were leaning over the railing watching  the floor full of housewives and teeny boppers get their groove on to some sultry R & B. Largely devoid from this concert were any males. If I was into black middle aged women I would have made out like a bandit. We became more and more amazed as the lyrics flowed from his mouth like a lounge lizard laying down cheesy pickup lines. And to this day we swore he cooed, "Girl, don't you know I wanna penetrate you." Fucking HI-larious.  Posted after the fact from the paper log on 06.30.04

        urlLink The Fiery Furnaces  at the 7th St. Entry Friday January 16th, 2004   Bob and I showed up to this show at about Midnight. The FF's were just taking the stage and as soon as they began I was lost. Lost in the singer's voice, not to mention her hair, clothes, posture, inflexion, and raw sex appeal.   I can't remember a time when I have been more engrossed with a band. When I say raw sex appeal I don't mean she was wearing a skimpy shirt and her tits were hanging out. That was not the case. I just mean that everything this woman did drove me over the edge. Her voice was a low growl filled with power. While singing she would slowly pan the audience with a near dead stare that transfixed it's recipient.  The music was equally excellent. It was off kilter and playful with a touch of darnkness that really set your ears on alert. I had heard only one song on Radio K but I felt like I knew them all. And I wanted to hear more.  After the show I waited patiently in line as a herd of geeky engrossed boys (which includes me) bought CD's from the singer at the merch table. I spent my last $10 on a sticker, pin, and CD that ended up stuck in my player for like 2 months straight. I babbled something to her about how much I liked them and to please come back soon. She was very amicable and extremely nice to my fawning self.  I cannot wait to get lost in her eyes again.  BTW her bandmate, Matt in the band also kicks ass.   urlLink Read this review of Gallowbird's Bark   Posted after the fact from the paper log on 06.30.04

       Colon Pipe at the VIP Room Wednesday January 14th, 2004   Ian and I saw Colon Pipe in First Avenue's VIP Room. Josh, Jens, and others were cranking out really loud crazy beats. Slide projector was putting up strange and touched up images of faces and places. They covered "Like a Prayer" and the crowd was going absolutely nuts! Great energy and atmosphere.

       Fahrenheit 9/11 Breaks Box Office Records   In addition to being the  urlLink #1 movie in America  Fahrenheit 9/11 broke the  urlLink all time record  for movies opening on less than 1,000 theaters.    urlLink NYT: Fahrenheit 9/11 is Highest Grossing Documentary of All Time!   It's really quite amazing. In the NYTimes article he talks about how this movie sold out at Military bases across the country. I for one, was wondering how it was going play to military families. I know that some group of assholes saying they represent military families is going to come forward and say it dishonors our armed services. But I think anyone who has seen the movie knows that it portrays the military as being in a fucked up situation that no one envies.  MPLS Indie

      Fahrenheit 9/11 Wednesday June 23, 2004  On Monday when I was working at  urlLink First Avenue  I was walking by the office when I thought I heard someone say, "Michael Moore.com" I was all like, "What?"  So I doubled back and inquired, "Say what?" I was then handed without question the single most exciting piece of paper I have seen in a great while. A free pass for two to  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 . I have been waiting for this movie to come out ever since Michael Moore gave his wonderful  urlLink rant .  So on Wednesday I traveled down through a torrential downpour to Block E. If you know anything about Block E and it's giant commercialist heart, you'd know that this was indeed a very weird place to see a Michael Moore movie. God I hate block E. Stopped by the box office and picked up my tickets. When I ordered them some guy next to me said, "What! That movie is playing!" He was so pissed to find out that you had to have a red piece of paper from the  urlLink  Shitty Pages  . All told the hosts of the evening said over 200 people were turned away.  Met up with me friend Bob at the Local and had some cheap pints. While we were at the bar we were discussing how great it is listening to other people's conversations on the bus. Because of all the fucked up stories and B/S you overhear. A little while later two business suits next to us were saying how they loved coming into  urlLink The Local  because they loved listening to people's conversations and all the character sketches and weird stories. The bar is filled with a bunch of 20-30 somethings dressed in business suits. Lot's of interesting stories there, yeah right.  OK so onto Fahrenheit 9/11. We walked down to Block E to line up for the movie at about 6:50 or 40 minutes before start. The line surrounding the ticket counter was frenzied. A huge ball of people were trying to get in line to buy tickets. Kind of strange for a Weds. night. Walking up the stairs we saw the line to get into the theater. It stretched all the way down one side of the hall. Probably took us 2 minutes to cue in past the people checking stubs.   The giant stadium theater was almost already totally full. We spotted 2 seats directly in the center. So we basically lucked out with the best seats in the house. The diversity of the crowd was awesome! Young people, old people, bikers, slackers, hippies, suits, punks, goths, black people(not just two either) and even a disproportionate number of visually impaired people.  I don't feel it's important to tell very many details about the movie except that it is a beautiful piece of art. Very powerful, extremely moving, and altogether maddening. It was a rollercoaster ride of emotion. And I use such a trite expression only because it was absolutely true. At certain points watching George W in the movie I wanted to scream out in anger at his follies and agendas. Other times I would simply tear up cause I could see the pain and suffering he has caused this country. One of the funniest things about the movie was the use of the song,  urlLink "Believe or not"  from the 80's sitcom  urlLink Greatest American Hero . Just wait till you see it. Hilarious!  I left the theater puffy eyed and feeling completely drained. Bob and I decided we neeeded a quick stiff drink to pull us out of that funk. So we headed to  urlLink Palmer's .  Upon arriving we had $5 between the two of us. So naturally that was enough for a Vodka Tonic and Pabst. Plus a $0.50 tip. God I love Palmer's.  MPLS Indie

      Why great bands play at shitty clubs is beyond me.    urlLink Spoon  is fantastical band that really upholds the ideals of what it means to play rock and or roll music. I'm all for bands trying real hard to stick to small venues when they could upgrade and play bigger rooms, but my fucking basement would have been more enjoyable.   Only under great duress, as in can I really pass up the chance to see "Favorite band", will I go see a band at the $4.00 Bar. Here are a couple of reasons:   Every drink is $4.00. That's right order up a vodka tonic, $4.00 (not to mention as much alcohol content as an O'Doul's). Order up a Budweiser $4.00. Order the cheapest shittest beer they have and you're gonna play $4.00. Although this might not be a problem cause it's not like your gonna want to tip the rude ass bartenders.   Rude is only half the problem with the bartenders. When you need one they're never around. A sold out show of hundreds will be served by two bartenders. More tips for me! Yay!  Never have I seen, or not seen, a stage with worse sightlines. Once again I offer up the services of my basement. There is probably about a 20' by 20' square directly in front of the stage where your view is unobstructed. To the left of the stage separating the bar from the pit is a wall with columns. Great idea columns! It was such a great idea they decided to put some more in the back to fuck up the sightlines from the back. I know I know structural support and all that shit. Great. But something could be done. This is the year 2004 and shit. Get some space age polymers in there and fix it. I'm sure if you gave  urlLink Ron Popeil  $39.95 plus S&H he'd figure it out.  I'm kinda just wondering why people pay money for a show. Get all hot and sweaty standing elbow to elbow with their neighbor only to talk about the stupidest shit during all the quiet songs. It's so unbelievelably rude to the band and the audience. And if you're gonna chat fucking leave! The show obviously sucks so just go to the nearest coffee shop  and talk about your coworker's lack of productivity or what you ate for dinner last night or what the fuck else you have to blab about.  It was a great fucking show when I got lost in the music and forgot where I was. Spoon played about 3 or 4 new songs. And a bunch of songs I knew the words too. (Which is saying a lot) Their energy and their lack of bravado was perfect.  So my suggestion to you is tell your favorite bands not to play at the $4.00 bar and get drunk at Palmer's beforehand like I did/do/will do. Plus their bartenders are much much cuter.

        Modest Mouse with The Walkmen at First Avenue Wednesday July 28th, 2004      I knew it was going to be a good night when on the way to the show Ian and I passed Lee Ranaldo from Sonic Youth on the street.    Cutey Patootey Lee Ranaldo I really had a tough time not berating him about playing at the  urlLink Quest . But I just nodded my head and said, "Welcome to Minneapolis" Deep down I'm a big wuss.  Arrived at First Ave and waded through slew of people trying to buy and or sell their tickets. Have I ever mentioned I  urlLink hate  scalpers? Well I do. The best one was a teeny bopper all dolled up in her rock skirt and cute accessories holding a sign that read "Need Tickets. $$ Big Money $$" But that's not the best part. The best part was her yummmie(Yuppie mommy) trailing along behind her actually swinging her purse as she walked!  Got there just in time to suck down a drink in the ultra crowded 21+ area and headed down to hear  The Walkmen . Ian already loved this band and had seen them a few times before. Me being an ignor'nt sonnabictch had never heard them before. This band from Washington D.C. is a 5 piece rock band that I thought sounded like a little bit of wonderful. I was really impressed. The lead singer looked a little like Ewin Mcgregor except with huge pipes. His emotion was off the charts as he sang and screamed his was through an excellent set. And as Ian pointed out the drummer looked like a muppet. Only because his arms and torso flopped around as if pulled by a drunk marioneteer.     Went back upstairs to the 21+ area and found myself drinking belvedere vodka like a pimp. It's actually because I can drink it there for cheap. Standing next to the Tetris machine watching Donald Duck and Goofy cartoons with my left eye and Wonder Woman with my right I was truly happy. Man I love the videos they put up on the screens before and after bands.  When Modest Mouse finally took the stage everyone was ready. The house was packed in like sardines. But not super-duper packed. Just really full. And to anyone who didn't get in to the show you can blame Zone 105 for all the damned whitecaps that were there. Tons and tons of frat boys and their skinny-nasty girlfriends leaning back into eachother's arms mouthing the words to "Float On". God I hate commercial radio. The crowd in general was fairly decent. More beautiful women then I could even get close to appreciating. Not that I could with all the great music going on.  Being very bad with song names I can't properly describe the excellent set list they had. If anyone has the set list could you email it to me please? During the middle of the show Isaac brought out a cardboard box and set it next to him on the stage. Hmmm... what's that box for? Later he explained that this was the "magic wishing song request box" and anyone who wanted to hear a song should think real hard into the box. Someone shouted out a song title later and he quickly shouted, "Into the box!" They played for about an hour give or take and only came out for an encore after the place was fucking shaking with shouts and stomps.  Yet another stellar Modest Mouse show and a wonderful evening at First Ave, and my only regret is that Sonic Youth didn't come on after Modest mouse. Instead they were a few blocks away making money for the man.  MPLS Indie  Check out a truly excellent interview with Modest Mouse at  urlLink The Onion .

       Exclusive! Yet another place on the Internet to download free MP3s of your favorite bands!    I'm sure this is old news to everyone else, but I just discovered this site called the internet Archive. A section of it is called the Audio Archive. So here are two things I have had the occasion to download.        urlLink ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead  - Live July 15th, 2004 at Big Orange in Austin Texas    Super high quality Flac files. What's a flac file? I don't know. All I know is I found a converter on cnet.com and changed them into wav files. I haven't even had a chance to listen to it yet but it's already in my CD carousel. So it could be 650mb of a refrigerator running for all I know.     urlLink Mogwai  - Live May 14th, 2001 Café de la Danse Paris, France.    If you have never seen Mogwai live you haven't abused your ears enough. I saw them at First Avenue and was blown away. My innards were literally shaking with the bass. You can understand then why their sound engineer beat the hell out of someone who tried fucking with the main board. Just like he did during this concert. Read about the fight  urlLink here .   Thanks to Swen for pointing this site out on his  urlLink blog .  MPLS Indie  PS I'm going to see Modest Mouse tonight all you haters can suck it!

        An Open Letter to Sonic Youth on their Return to Minneapolis      &nbsp;  Dear Sonic Tooth,   You are one of the most influential bands of your generation. I love you guys. I love your music. I love what your music stands for. That is why am I wondering WHY THE  FUCK  ARE YOU PLAYING AT THE QUEST!    Did you not know it is exclusively booked by  urlLink Clearchannel ? Surely you must know this corporation airs the programs of Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura. And owns and operates over 200 venues nationwide. What went wrong? Were you really all that excited about playing at the same venue as every  urlLink sell out whore  to ever hit the radio waves?   Why, I ask you why! Why not play at First Avenue or any other club? Sure it's small. Sure they probably wouldn't be able to front you the tens of thousands of dollars The Quest is frontin' you. But at least you'd still have my respect. That may not mean much to you but it means a lot to me.   Please feel free to  urlLink contact  Sonic Youth and tell them how you feel.   Mpls Indie

       Kurmudgeon at the Triple Rock Social Club Sunday July 11th, 2004   Having known half this band for probably half our lives I decided it would be worth going to the Triple Rock to check it out. Did that make sense?  I had the unfortunate experience of finding out that the triple rock no longer has happy hours on Saturdays or Sundays. It used to be $2 taps from 7-9pm. As Bob pointed out they probably are trying to make some money or something.   I unfortunately got there just as  urlLink Cowboy Curtis  was done. But at least I got to hear one song. Quite good.  Talked with Justin and Tim before the show. I have a sneaking suspicion Tim was drunk. Got my drink on waiting for them to set up. The boys played very well. I love watching them get to work on their jangling driving discord melodies. Every brain cell in their heads is poured into their guitars and it shows. Great set. The perfect rock length. Not sure exactly how long but they quit long before I could lose interest.  You can check out their article in the pulse  urlLink here  or just read the quote here:   Kurmudgeon @ Triple Rock Social Club    urlLink Maybe it's this whole Braid reunion business that's got me feeling nostalgic for boys with buzzing guitars and emotional issues, but either way, the sound of TC youngster's Kurmudgeon on their debut outing for local all ages scene king Afternoon Records, Cables & Ties, has me doing some pretty fierce head-bopping. ...

       They Might Be Giants at First Avenue Friday July 9th, 2004   Missed both the #16 and the #50 by about 30 seconds. Both buses head right down near the Triple Rock where I was headed to meet a friend for a few happy hour pints. There really isn't anything more annoying than  urlLink missing the bus . I finally arrived at the  urlLink T-Rock  and Bob was already waiting. I had two pints of cider and a round of St. Anthony's.   Feeling just dandy I headed over to First Avenue for the show. TMBG had just started when I got there. Boy do I love it when that happens. John and John were really funny. They had a really great banter going on and their song selection, although mostly new stuff, was great.  The funniest thing I heard them say was in reference to their free  urlLink kids show  at Orchestra Hall the next day.  "You should all come down to our free show tomorrow. It's at 11 in the fucking morning! And it's supposed to be a kids show, but if you guys all come it won't be. Yeah, come stand in front of some kids.  They closed out the show with a double encore of "Fingertips". Which if you are a fan you'd know how extremely manic that is. If you don't know it's 18 snippets of random weird ass "songs" or clips.  Very enjoyable concert experience and I am even more annoyed that I hadn't seen them before. Hi Catarina!  Mpls Indie

       Anyone want to go to They Might Be Giants at First Avenue with me?    urlLink They Might Be Giants  are going to rock the shit out of  urlLink First Avenue  on Friday July 9th, 2004 and I got some extra tickets.   I just watched " urlLink Gigantic ", which is their rock documentary, and it was great. TMBG are one of my top 25 bands of all time. They are pretty much the first band I ever "understood". They were that first band I was able to see beyond the face value of the lyrics.  I am so sad to admit that in my 10+ years of loving TMBG I have never ever seen them. It has been one monumental fuck-up or fuck-over after another that has caused me to miss them. One time I wanted to go but got too drunk beforehand and couldn't make it out.   The worst time was when I found out that TMBG would be in Minneapolis the same weekend I would be in Chicago. I found out while I was in Chicago they were playing that night. I went to  urlLink The Metro  found a sold out sign in the window. I walked away disappointed only to be confronted by a scalper. He was trying to sell a $15 for like $50. I blew up at him and started screaming that he was a asshole and only the worst people in the world would profit from another person's joy. He got really pissed and started yelling at me. I thought for sure he was going to try and beat me down. Finally another fan started yelling at him too and he told everyone to fuck off and went to bother someone else.  Oh well. At least I've almost been killed in Chicago.  MPLS Indie

       She better not have any offspring...           PALMERTON, Pa. -- Bandit, the world's heaviest raccoon, rests in the lap of Deborah "Pepper" Klitsch on Jan. 30, 2001. Bandit, a junk-food crazed critter billed as the world's weightiest raccoon, died Saturday, May 8, 2004. Klitsch denied the occasional charge that she overfed the rotund raccoon, whose weight ballooned to nearly 75 pounds, three times the average for his breed. He was born with a bad thyroid gland, Klitsch said. (05/12/04 AP photo)    Fer fuck's sake! How these people live past the age of 18 I have no idea. Her parents should have put her down when they had the chance. First of all who besides Hobos and poker players have nicknames. Second of all I don't believe for one second it has a fucking thyroid problem. She probably has it around so she lives with something that eats more junk food then her.

       Suicide Girls Saturday July 3rd, 2004   Mmmmm, mmmm, mmmm. Damn, this is some tasty business. If you have no idea what Suicide Girls is make sure you're somewhere you can look at nekid ladies then click on this  urlLink link .?   OK now that you know you can only imagine what a burlesque show(read strip show) featuring these lovely ladies would be like. Being this was my second experience I knew what to expect. I showed up at like 9:15 which had them already started. Grabbed a drink and sat back for the ride. The best thing about these shows is not the strippers with tattoos(OK it is) but the music. Where else can you see nearly naked ladies get their groove on to Modest Mouse and the Pixies If you know of any let me know.  My favorite was the girl dressed up in cutoff jeans and t-shirt that stripped to AC/DC while slamming Pabst Blue Ribbon and spitting it all over the crowd. And I even loathe AC/DC!  Bottom line go check them out when you can. It's worth it.  Mpls Indie

       "Spiderman 2" Tuesday July 6th, 2004   Even though this movie has the shittiest title ever, I might have to agree with Roger Ebert when he said, "Spider-Man 2" is the  urlLink best superhero movie  since the modern genre was launched with "Superman".   The special effects are fucking outstanding and the story line is top notch. They weren't afraid to slow this one down a little. A lot of people complain about that fact. Which I think is stupid. But then again I loved Ang Lee's "The Hulk".  You can read Ebert's review for yourself. It's more coherent.  MPLS Indie

       BBQ Ribs are Better than Drugs Sunday July 4th, 2004   This weekend Bob and I(read mostly Bob) made the best meal I think I have ever had. Or can remember. I bought everything at the St. Paul Farmer's Market including the meat and it was gorgeous.  The menu was as follows:    Flatbread w/ cucumber raita  (a mild cucumber yogurt dip with red onion)   Margarita watermelon : Watermelon infused with  urlLink Pátron (really fucking expensive tequila), triple sec, and lime shavings.   Roasted corn and  urlLink jicama  salad : Roasted corn on the grill, green onions, carrots, jicama, cilantro, and basil all diced and mixed. Topped with a lemon/lime/olive oil/salt and pepper dressing.   BBQ cabbage . Cabbage stuffed with butter, onion, and garlic powder and BBQ'd for 2 hours. (I guess it is a traditional thing to eat with BBQ)   BBQ Babyback Ribs : Soaked in a beer brine for 20 hours and rubbed down with two different rubs and slow cooked over charcoal and hickory chips for 3 hours.   Fresh Plum Napoleon : Fresh plums made into a jam. Then layer upon layer of puff pastry with cream and sliced plums in between.     Hopefully I can get some pictures and maybe a movie or two of the food. Yeah we had a digital video camera floating around.  MPLS Indie

       St. Paul Farmer's Market and Pea Pods   For the past four years I have worked at the  urlLink St. Paul Farmer's Market . Getting up at 5:30am on a Saturday morning never felt so good. Really, there is nothing better than getting up ass early and being among a whole load of good food.  If you don't believe me come down and see for yourself. I've also discovered that fresh pea pods "taste like life." Have you ever had a fresh pea pod before? If you want to know what life tastes like you should buy some.         And during corn season there is no better meal then a half dozen ears of corn prepared on the grill.  But don't come down on Sundays. It's filled with jerks fresh out of church.

       Single Speed Bikes are Great... for Me to Poop On!   I've had a flat tire on my bike for about 9 days now. Yes, my laziness surprises even me some times. So when I wanted to get over to Bob's last night to watch  urlLink Shortcuts , which by the way is an extremely excellent movie,  I decided to bother my excellent housemate, Josh.   "Hey Josh can I borrow your bike?"   Josh being a nice guy said, "Sure, be careful it's a single speed. Will you have it back tonight?"   "Yeah, no problem thanks"  If you're not familiar with what a Single Speed bike is check  urlLink this shit  out.  See how the gears are non-existent? Looks so simple and easy. Wrong.  I hopped on rode to St. Paul, no problem. When the bike is moving you  have  to keep peddling. Very tricky when you are going down a huge hill and constantly gaining speed and you try to slow down, it doesn't work. Or at least I'm too retarded to figure it out.  On my way back at about 1am I crashed the fuck out of the bike(yes I was sober). I couldn't stop, smashed into a curb, flipped over the bars, and managed to get schmucked in the head by the bike. Now I have road rash on my elbows, knees, shins, palms, and two nice gashes on my head. I'll try and get a picture of my head. It's pretty funny.   So to all you single speeders out there: Don't borrow me your bike  Mpls Indie

       I Have Seen the Light! And It's Name Is Nullsoft Streaming Video ( NSV )   If you haven't figured this out yet please, do it for the children. This is the coolest thing to happen to the Internet since Al Gore. Basically go  urlLink here . Download the newest version of Winamp. And you're set to go.   After installing Winamp open the Media Library, it is a little button with ML on it, and click on the Internet TV link in the sidebar. From there Winamp will produce a list of available streams. Yesterday I watched so much TV I think I'm blind right now and just guessing really well how to blog this. Oh and here is a hint, if you try a popular stream and it says "Stream Full ICY 400" just set the playlist to repeat selection and Winamp will continually try to get on that stream.  Here are a couple of excellent feeds to check out:       urlLink  Saltwater Chimp   - This is the best one I've found right now. They have about 14 streams available. Since they are so good it takes about 10 minutes give or take to get a stream. Currently they stream: Invader Zim(2 streams), Monty Python + Kids In The Hall(1), News Radio(2), Seinfeld(3), Simpsons(2), South Park(1), Penn and Teller - Bullshit!(2), and Sifl and Olly(1). Being able to watch News Radio anytime I want is so fucking beautiful.   urlLink  TV Gold   - UK TV classics from the 70s, 80s and 90s. They have an insanely large number of shows that they broadcast. Here are a few of my favorites: Mr Bean, Faulty Towers, Blackadder, Red Dwarf, and Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy.   urlLink  Web Ranger   - Really great site that offers "classic TV". Such as Horror, Cult Films, Westerns, Comedy, and Cartoons. Too many things to name. But some that I have watched are Ultraman(Japanese), really old Porky Pig cartoons, and any cheesy ass monster movie from the 50's and 60's you can imagine.    urlLink Valley of the wind / Ghost in the shell Anime FORUM   - Great Anime from Japan. Most of it looks like stuff you can't get in America. Including the Ghost in the Shell show for lack of a better name. Here's the link to the stream.   urlLink  Aqua Teen Hunger Force   - If you haven't seen this show and you think you have a good sense of humor watch this to test yourself. If you don't laugh you're already dead.   urlLink  Ween TV   - If you are a Ween fan this is your new mana from heaven. I am a huge fan of Ween and in 10 minutes of watching I learned something. Loads of TV appearances, foreign interviews, and live performances.   urlLink  Random Intersection in Paris   - Who knows. Cheesy happy music playing while a video displays an intersection in Paris. Kinda funny.    urlLink Family Guy Network (by AvsFan)   - The greatest injustice of all time is that Family Guy isn't as popular as the Simpson's. This show was axed after just 2 or 3 seasons and went on to become one of the fastest selling DVD's of all time.   urlLink  JAPAN.ArtTokyo     - This is truly one of the most befuddling streams I have seen. It seems to be 24 hrs a day of a brown fluffy puppy sitting in a wooden chair while classical music is played. Those crazy Japanese. I think it's a way for tired business men to feel good about life again. Either that or there are a lot of stoners in Japan.     Whew! That's a lotta writing for one day. I hope you get a chance to check these out. Well worth it.   MPLS Indie

      OK I knew I didn't like this guy. Apparently the "democratic" mayor of St. Paul has decided to support Dumbeeya Bush in the upcoming election.   "George Bush and I do not agree on a lot of issues," Kelly said in a statement."But in turbulent times, what the American people need more than anything is continuity of government, even with some imperfect policies"    Hmmm... let's think about that for a minute. Who else would fit in that category? Let's see Lyndon Johnson(think massive bombing in Vietnam), Hitler, Stalin to name an obvious few. Of course this is an exaggeration but with all the deep shit Bush has put us in I think a valid one.  That is the lamest excuse I have ever heard. Why in the hell is he bending over like this? What could he hope to gain? Is he perhaps going to change parties and run for a national office like his piece of shit step and fetchit predecessor Norm Coleman?  Who knows all I know is that I'm calling old Randy and telling him what I think. And I encourage everyone who reads this to pick up the phone and call him. It doesn't take much.   Mayor Randy kelly 390 City Hall, 15 West Kellogg Blvd. Saint Paul, MN 55102  phone 651-266-8510  fax 651-266-8513   Or feel free to give any of these  urlLink people  a call and let them know that you will not be voting for him ever again. Even if you don't live in St. Paul.  Mpls Indie
