      well the basic POINT of this "blogger" thing is so my friends in Texas and every where else in this country (as they all seemed to move around within this past summer) can keep track of my life and see if i dissapoint them or not. There are too many of them to call every week to give them an update. Plus this way i figure they can find out how im doing if they make the effort. So lets see im 17, graduated from GHS and going off to BYU baby. Im so there. Cougars here i come. I got accepted FINALLY to EFY today. Carolyn is totally stoked, as am I. I work ALL the dang time. Its so unfufilling bc my money goes straight to BYU and the church so i always seem to only have about $50 bucks in my account. Not cool. My life is going pretty well. My papa is being cool. Stephen is such a baller. He is a cool kid and I love that he is going to EFY. It might be a little akward me trying to get my mack on with my brother right there the whole time. whatever though. I'll do what I can. I get my young Women's medallion sunday. I earned it SO long ago though that it totally lost its affect. But whatever, im happy to have it. There is no boy here or there for me. I dont even need or want one. Im sick of them. Im happy on my own. Adam and i went out a fews days ago and it was totally the saddest try of a date ive ever seen. The luck was horrible. But the dates that followed that one were not bad. SO i guess it all evens out.I leave in a month and im VERY interested to see how it all goes  with me and my friends .I am gonna make every effort to stay in contact with them but you know you know. I will deffinitly live my life and they can live theirs but i dont want it to be all akward when i come home again. Lets see what else. Summer is a little past half way over and i have done nothing. I've made some goals and they GOTTA get done so i have SOME fun memories. Well its late ill try to write often so  people can see whats up.
