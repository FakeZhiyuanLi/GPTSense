      today wasnt too bad.. went to work at 11 then hung out with amy for a while then went to thomas' and played cabella's for a while, which is awesome. im listening to linkin park and theyve got this song called hit the floor... i find the lyrics quite fitting for some recent situations... the bolded part in particular.  There were just too many times people have tried to look inside of me Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away Afraid to say what was on my mind Afraid to say what I need to say Too many things that you say about me when I’m not around You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down But i've had too many stand-offs with you, its about as much as I can stand So I’ll wait until the upper hand is mine  One minute your on top The next your not, watch it drop Making your heart stop Just before you hit the floor One minute your on top The next your not, missed your shot Making your heart stop You think you've won And then it's all gone  So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies So concerned of what you think, to just say what we feel inside So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long All I know is that all I want is to feel like i'm not stepped on There are so many things you say that make me feel you've cross the line What goes up will surely fall, and i'm counting down the time Cause i've had so many stand-offs with you, its about as much as I can stand So i'm waiting until the upper hand is mine  One minute your on top The next your not, watch it drop Making your heart stop Just before you hit the floor One minute your on top The next your not, missed your shot Making your heart stop You think you've won And then it's all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone Now it’s all gone   I know i'll never trust a single thing you say You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway And all the lies have got you floating up above us all But what goes up has got to fall   One minute your on top The next your not, watch it drop Making your heart stop Just before you hit the floor One minute your on top The next your not, missed your shot Making your heart stop You think you've won And then it's all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone Now it’s all gone  HA   goodnight funky-t

      this has been a blah day... nothin has really happened, which i guess could be considered a good thing. i got up around 11 and sat around till 1:30 when i went to work. got home around 4 and chilled till about 7 when stephanie and will came over. will had rented the first season of reno 911 which is hilarious. i think its one of my favorite shows.. after about 6 or 7 episodes we sat around and burned some cd's, then went home. im glad to say this has been the most uneventful day of my life : ). i dont feel like typing anymore so i guess thats it for tonight.  goodnight funky-t

      i just got home from seeing farenheit 9/11, and i have to say it had a really big effect on me. Michael Moore did an awesome job putting it together, and it really makes you think why we're really in iraq. the bottom line is there really is no point: iraq never killed one american before we invaded their country, they supposedly "harbored" sadaam hussein and other terrorists, and thats why we went in there... thats bullshit. bush cannot get a grip of world issues and had no right to put troops into iraq for absolutely no benefit other than self-monetary improvment, as if he wasn't doing so great already. As it turns out, bush senior is very involved (and by involved i mean stockholder) in many companies involving u.s. participation in their government and economic policies. it seems that little bush junior caught on and decided to jump on the bandwagon. its clear to see that were in iraq for oil, and bush doesnt give a shit about much else.. wow, did i really just have the want to write all that down? that doesnt seem like my lazy-ass self.. meh, i guess you now know how i feel. earlier today i wrote that bush beats kerry anyday... im not so sure of that anymore.  also.. why cant people be civilized and the least bit respectful anymore.. sometimes they just dont understand. too bad you can't always say it'll be better tomorrow.  i guess thats all for tonight.. its 1 and ive got work tomorrow.. which brings up another point.. i hate my job and i want to kill myself while at it. if it wernt for (some) people i work with i would definately be done with that place.  goodnight funky-t

      Well, this is my first post and I'm not sure what all I should write about.. so I guess I'll just start by saying what I did today... Woke up around 10 and worked on my computer and finally got it to work :) . Around 12:30 I put the dogs out and went up to niver western wear. My dad sold his building so i'm helping him clean it out.. which is easier said than done being that its about 30,000 square feet. I cleaned out one room upstairs and threw a lot of stuff away, it felt weird throwing all this perfectly useless stuff, yet still in perfectly good condition, away. I found a lawn mower that had broken a few years ago and put it out by the dumpster, then 10 minutes later i walked out and a black homeless guy was wheeling it away.. i figured it wouldnt stay there for very long : ). Around 3:30 I left and went to yogi's and stopped by to see katey and patrick.. then went home and have been here since.. I'm trying to find something to do this summer to keep me busy.. i don't think FDBD is enough. For those of you who don't know what FDBD is.. I guess I'll post some stuff on it later. I guess thats about it, im leavin in a few minutes to go see farenheit 9/11 with some of the guys, it looks pretty entertaining simply because it makes bush look like a fucktard, but then again, id rather have bush in office than kerry.. ugh. i'll probly add somemore when i get home..  later funky-t

      so tonight was a pretty normal night at work, until about 9:45 when the electrician came to fix some power problems.. he shut off all the power for about 20 minutes and when he turned it back on, the alarm started going off. that shitty ass alarm is loud as shit and kept going on and on and on for about 30 minutes. ADT kept calling, which was fun, then our phones went out. sweet. all and all, we finally just pulled the plug to the alarm and locked up the store, right around 11, finishing off my fantastic night at yogis. i just got home and im sure i smell like ass so ima hop in the shower and go to bed.  goodnight funky-t

      For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a switch. Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tailpipe by drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily. Attach the wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! Again be careful that no one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 20 feet!!!  goodnight funky-t

      I know i just posted some stuff, but this was just too cool.. check it out, it seems way too easy.. homemade napalm.  - Pour some gas into an old bowl, or some kind of container.  - Get some styrofoam and put it in the gas, until the gas won't  eat anymore. You should have a sticky syrup.  - Put it on the end of something (don't touch it!!) and light that bitch up. The unused  stuff lasts a long time!

      its been a while since ive written in this thing but i found something new to do with it, every night i'll add some "techniques" you may find interesting... tonight's post... a new ID : ).. enjoy   You might be saying, "Hey Nick, what do I need a new identity for?" The answer is simple. You might want to go buy liquor somewhere, right? You might want to go give the cops the false name when you get busted so you keep your good name, eh?  You might even want to use the new identity for getting a P.O. Box for carding. Sure! You might even want the stuff for renting yourself a VCR at some dickless loser of a convenience store. Here we go: Getting a new ID isn't always easy, no one said it would be. By following these steps, any bozo can become a new bozo in a coupla weeks.  STEP 1  The first step is to find out who exactly you'll become. The most secure way is to use someone's ID who doesn't use it themselves. The people who fit that bill the best are dead. As an added bonus they don't go complaining one bit. Go to the library and look through old death notices. You have to find someone who was born about the same time as you were, or better yet, a year or two older so you can buy booze, etc. You should go back as far as you can for the death because most states now cross index deaths to births so people can't do this in the future. The cutoff date in Wisconsin is 1979, folks in this grand state gotta look in 1978 or earlier. Anything earier there is cool. Now, this is the hardest part if you're younger. Brats that young happen to be quite resilient, takin' falls out of three story windows and eating rat poison like its Easter candy, and not a scratch or dent. There ain't many that die, so ya gotta look your ass off. Go down to the library and look up all the death notices you can, if it's on microfilm so much the better. You might have to go through months of death notices though, but the results are well worth it. You gotta get someone who died locally in most instances: the death certificate is filed only in the county of death. Now you go down to the county courthouse in the county where he died and get the death certificate, this will cost you around $3-$5 depending on the state you're in. Look at this hunk of paper, it could be your way to vanish in a clould of smoke when the right time comes, like right after that big scam. If You're lucky, the slobs parents signed him up with social security when he was a snot nosed brat. That'll be another piece of ID you can get. If not, thats ok too. It'll be listed on the death certificate if he has one. If you're lucky, the stiff was born locally and you can get his birth certificate right away.  STEP 2  Now check the place of birth on the death certificate, if it's in the same place you standing now you're all set. If not, you can mail away for one from that county but its a minor pain and it might take a while to get, the librarian at the desk has listings of where to write for this stuff and exactly how much it costs. Get the Birth cirtificate, its worth the extra money to get it certified because thats the only way some people will accept it for ID. When yur gettin this stuff the little forms ask for the reason you want it, instead of writing in "Fuck you", try putting in the word "Geneology". They get this all the time.  If the Death certificate looks good for you, wait a day or so before getting the certified birth certificate in case they recognize someone wanting it for a dead guy.  STEP 3  Now your cookin! You got your start and the next part's easy. Crank out your old Dot matrix printer and run off some mailing labels addressed to you at some phony address. Take the time to check your phony address that there is such a place. Hotels that rent by the month or large apartment buildings are good, be sure to get the right zip code for the area. These are things that the cops might notice that will trip you up.  Grab some old junk mail and paste your new lables on them. Now take them along with the birth certificate down to the library. Get a new library card. If they ask you if you had one before say that you really aren't sure because your family moved around alot when you were a kid. Most libraries will allow you to use letters as a form of ID when you get your card. If they want more give them a sob story about how you were mugged and got your wallet stolen with all your identification. Your card should be waiting for you in about two weeks. Most libraries ask for two forms of ID, one can be your trusty Birth Certificate, and they do allow letters addressed to you as a second form.  STEP 4  Now you got a start, it isn't perfect yet, so let's continue. You should have two forms of ID now. Throw away the old letters, or better yet stuff them inside the wallet you intend to use with this stuff. Go to the county courthouse and show them what nice ID you got and get a state ID card. Now you got a picture ID. This will take about two weeks and cost about $5, its well worth it.  STEP 5  If the death certificate had a social security number on it you can go out and buy one of those metal SS# cards that they sell. If it didn't, then you got all kinds of pretty ID that shows exactly who you are. If you don't yet have an SS#, Go down and apply for one, these are free but they could take five or six weeks to get, Bureaucrats you know... You can invent a SS# too if ya like, but the motto of 'THE WALKING GLITCH' has always been "Why not excellence?".  STEP 6  If you want to go whole hog you can now get a bank account in your new name.  If you plan to do alot of traveling then you can put alot of money in the account and then say you lost the account book.  After you get the new book you take out all the cash. They'll hit you with a slight charge and maybe tie-up your money some, but if you're ever broke in some small town that bank book will keep you from being thrown in jail as a vagrant.  ALL DONE?  So kiddies, you got ID for buying booze, but what else? In some towns (the larger the more likely) the cops if they catch you for something petty like shoplifting stuff under a certain dollar amount, will just give you a ticket, same thing for pissing in the street. Thats it! No fingerprints or nothing, just pay the fine (almost always over $100) or appear in court.  Of course they run a radio check on your ID, you'll be clean and your alter-ego gets a blot on his record. Your free and clear.  Thats worth the price of the trouble you've gone through right there.  If your smart, you'll toss that ID away if this happens, or better yet, tear off your picture and give the ID to someone you don't like, maybe they'll get busted with it. If you're a working stiff, here's a way to stretch your dollar. Go to work for as long as it takes to get unemployment and then get yourself fired. Go to work under the other name while your getting the unemployment. With a couple of sets of ID, you can live like a king.
