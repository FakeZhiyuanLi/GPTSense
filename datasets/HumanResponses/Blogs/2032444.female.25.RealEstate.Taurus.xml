       b had to work this morning, and thought it would be a great idea to leave his car with me so i could venture out on my own.  i attempted santa monica blvd., but it is seriously like going out on a battlefield.  drivers here are nuts.  i could stand it just long enough to make it to the coffee bean for a latte and then back to b's condo.  i'd certainly be more careful if i was driving a $100,000 two door vehicle.  with the popular use of pain killers and muscle relaxers out here, one would think the drivers would be much more mellow.  i guess being honked at only twice in my five mile adventure wasn't too, too bad.  so, needlesstosay, i'm back here at the penthouse, where i will sit waiting patiently for my driver to get home.  happy halloween pookies.  wear reflectors.

       i am waxed and tanned and ready for hollywood.   brian hickerson, i love you.  i told brian i was going to l.a. for a photo shoot, and he believed me.   or maybe he just didn't want to hurt my feelings?   gina told me not to accept anything from strangers.  i told her i wouldn't, unless it was in a pill form.   or a boob job.   nanny nanny boo boo.  i'm going on vacation, and you're not!

       Tuesday nights a team composed of participants from my company (maintenance men on up to the vice president) gather together for our weekly softball game.  We have too much fun.  It's comical, because we tend to win (we're tied for 1st place), but you wouldn't know it if you saw us playing.  Our team completely goofs off the entire game, while our competitors tend to take the game a tad more seriously.  I think it really pisses them off to see us ahead, while Amy is doing a booty dance in the outfield and I'm screaming "shit" anytime a ball comes in the vicinity of me.  The truth is, our boy players are so good, that they make up for the girl's incompetence, effortlessly.  I really think that a huge part of the secret behind our success is Mike's pants (he comes outfitted in full on baseball attire, complete with striped pants, the tall socks, and cleats).  I am responsible for providing the team with wisdom, like my recent explanation of why girls are pitched the small balls, whilst boys are pitched big balls.  I have double-duty on the team, also serving as the team cheerleader.  I only have a handful of encouraging phrases that I tend to overuse.    Last night we were short a girl player, so to avoid having to forfeit, my friend Sarah joined the circus.  She, of course, forgot her baseball glove, but it was okay because she wore a gold shirt (a sparkley one).  They positioned Sarah at third base.  She was so nervous about being put in such an eminent position on the field.  So, every time a new batter got up, I would holler from the outfield "get ready Sarah, the play's at your base."  Then at the completion of each play, regardless of where the play was, I would yell "great job Sarah, you did great!"    I only got reprimanded by the umpires (or refs, as I like to call them) once last night, for using the fuck word in the dug out.  We had a blast, and I am so glad Sarah got to be a part of the madness.  I have to enjoy every moment with her, she is just growing up so fast.  She has established a checklist that she completes each time she exits an environment.  "Phone, check.  Wallet, check.  Keys, check."  I was so proud.

       if she introduces me as amberlou one more time, i'm going to start introducing her as fupa, and that's all there is to it.  why does it bother me so much that: a)she has a picture of herself framed on her desk b)she looks like the k.f.c. colonel c)she calls all women *sister* d)she fills the kool-aid pitcher up to the brim e)she refers to all asian people as *orientals* f)she does not line the cookies up in straight lines on the cookie sheet g)she calls it the sandy volleyball court h)she calls them spooky movies

       I know I'm weird, and should probably never admit this out loud, but as excited as I am to go to L.A., I dread leaving my dog behind.  Isn't that sad and pathetic?  I would love to say that he is very attached, but the truth of the matter is that WE are very attached.  Last time I left him with my mom, he ate a pillow.  Last time I left him with my mom, I called at least twice a day to check on him.  This, among other reasons, is why I probably shouldn't have children.

       Dear Stephanie Bradley, You are a pathetic excuse for a human being.  You disgust me.  I try hard not to be that person, that person that lets other people's disgust and misery affect me, but now you've fucked with the wrong person.  You have crossed the path of an individual whom is idolized by his friends, family, and children. Your name is mud.  Throughout the time I have known you, I have known you to be very sick, very selfish, very self-centered, very greedy, very inconsiderate and very materialistic.  I've know this.  We've all known this.  But your behavior, your true self has become undeniable this past week.  It's not true what they say.  Money is not the root of all evil.  Nor is the love of money.  What is true, what is the root of all evil, is the love of other people's money.  Your love of other people's money.  You are not a victim of life.  None of us are.  Fuck what your mother, father, sister, brother, ex husband, ex boyfriend, or whomever did to you.  Where you've been was their fault.  Where you are is yours.    Now, Ms. Bradley, get the fuck out of our lives.  Gather whatever fucking pride and dignity you have left and walk away.  You're not wanted here, you never were.    With Deepest Regards, Amber

       I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not, but the assistant manager where I work introduces me to everyone as 'her entertainment'.    This time next week I will be drunk in a bar somewhere in Los Angeles.  I'm so fucking excited.  My best friend Brian lives there.  Last year I visited and was able to score us both free drinks the first bar we went to, then we went to San Diego and I scored.  B, I fully expect free tickets to something bad ass and a trip to some really trendy bar.  And, if you can score us some pot, that would be super.  Also, my friend Robert lives there.  Robert's not very reliable, so I'm not sure how much of him I'll get to see.  He dates a hot chick, bartends,  and is going to be a super model one day.  I love Robert to death, despite his lack of dependability and that it takes him two months to return a phone call.  One time, when we lived together in the den of sin, I was really sad because of a stupid boyfriend.  Robert came home with three different kinds of icecream for me.    I need a fantastic idea for a Halloween costume.  I don't mind anything themed around slutty clothing.  Your suggestions appreciated.  Brian needs one too.  He most likely does not want to dress slutty, butyouneverknow.

       my friend sarah, she's brilliant.  she really is.  we were roommates in college.  she would stay up until 5 am studying, then set her alarm for 6:30 am to get up and study more.  as a side note, she also ate cereal 3 out of 3 meals.  kelloggs, if you listening, you should offer her a contract...she could double your business like jared did for subway.  back to the topic.  sarah studied biochemistry.  she graduated with a 4.0 at the top of her class and shit.  she got to wear a special rope around her gown and got to stand up and say some shit in front of the entire crowd at the frank erwin center.  now she is working on her PHD, but debating giving that up to go to stanford and get a law degree.  she appears to do all of this pretty effortlessly.  but once you get to know sarah, once you really get to know her, the plot thickens.  the girl is a complete trip.  i can't recall a single time we got together that she didn't either forget her keys or wallet somewhere.  she refuses to carry a purse, only a wallet.  i'm convinced she should wear a fanny pack.  a brightly colored one with her name and phone number embroidered on it. i am having dinner with her tonight, and i can't wait.  last time we had dinner she told me that she wants to go on a date.  not with anyone meaningful, just hot.  she doesn't want them to be intelligent or funny, just arm candy.

Of course, first, big ups to God, without you, none of this would of been possible.  I'd like to thank my agent Nicole.  You work around the clock for me, and I love ya for it.  Thanks to my B, for always keepin' it real.  If I look like shit, you're gonna tell me I look like shit, and I love ya for that.  Thank you Sarah for being my smart friend.  Everyone needs a smart friend, and I'm glad you're mine.  Lacey, I love you.  If I fart, I know you won't leave the room, you're amazing.  Thanks to my family, ya'll tried to screw me up, man did ya'll try, but I turned out okay.  Mom, I love you and the fact that you eat Grapenuts in yogurt.  Dad I love you and the fact that you never have your cell phone turned on.  Jessie your very presence is angelic.  Jantha, you listen to me endlessly, and only occasionally interrupt to complain about your braces or the rocket launcher downtown or la fas...you're totally awesome.  Thanks Gina, you know way more about my personal hygiene than anybody else, and you still call me your friend.  Amy, you're gorgeous, and that has helped me pick up a lot of dudes...thanks for your help, I love ya.  Matt, Frank, and Carey...You're never inappropriate, so I don't have to worry about negative attention when with you in public, that's great.  Parker, what can I say?  You let me kiss you and call you booger butt, even when your friends are around.  Oh yeah, and of course, my baby daddy, Parker Sr.  Shout out to you up in Heaven."

       When I was in the fifth grade, all fifth graders were required to go through the D.A.R.E. program.  I'm sure you're familiar with it.  It's the public school system's attempt to keep kids off drugs.  Every school was assigned an officer from the local police force to head up the program, and instill some anti-drug values in these young minds.  Our officer was Officer Potrowski.  Officer Potrowski and I hit it off well (No, not that well.  It's not one of those stories you sickos).  At this time in my life, the worst behavior I would exhibit would be talking too much in class and getting my honor badge taken away.  Drugs were the furthest thing from my mind.  In fact, my journal entries in my D.A.R.E. workbook were so fantastic, that at the end of the program, Officer Potrowski selected me, yes me, as his star D.A.R.E. student.  I got to stand up at the final D.A.R.E. assembly and on a microphone, in front of all my fellow classmates, faculty, and parents, make a declaration to be drug free for life.    Okay, so I put my foot in my mouth.  Fast forward 2 years.  I was in the seventh grade.  I hung around a super cool crowd referred to at that time as the 'skaters'.  Well, they skateboarded. I just wore the cool shoes.  So, I suppose I was more of a 'poser'.  All my skater friends were very different than I.  They had names like Jasmine and Havalah.  Their parents smoked pot and burned incense.  They were allowed to wear torn clothing and die their hair bright colors.  I was not.  So, In all my attempts to fit in with this crowd, I decided the best way to do so would be to take part in the same extracurricular activities that they were involved in.  They weren't so much into the pep squad, journalism or track.  No, they much preferred things like skipping school and LSD.  So, in the seventh grade, barely having had my first period and still wearing a training bra, I decided to drop acid with my friend Havalah...at school.  Brilliant.  Now, this was also a period in my life when writing notes and folding them into super cool shapes and passing them off in the hallway between periods was cool.  Of course, most seventh graders were writing about what boy they had a crush on, or what girl had bad acne.  No, not Havalah and I.  We were smart enough to provide adults with written documentation about our illegal drug use at school.    Unbeknownst to us at the time, because of our shady appearances and odd behaviors, we were being kept under close surveillance by the entire faculty of Fulmore Middle School.  Primarily, they had been searching our lockers to see what mischievous acts us 'skaters' had been up to.  During one of their routine searches, JACKPOT.  Finally...Evidence!  For me, it was a normal day at school, or at least it began that way.  Then, fourth period.  Mr. Henry, our hall monitor,  came into the classroom with a pink slip of paper and whispered something to my teacher.  She looks my direction and says "Amber Ferris, they would like to speak with you in the office."  I knew this was bad.  It wasn't often that Mr. Henry came to personally escort people to the office.  Routinely, they would just send a note with one of your peers serving as an office aide, requesting your presence in the office.  But, when Mr. Henry came, you knew you'd fucked up.  As I was brought into the office, and lead to our principal,  Mrs. Baldwin's desk, I scanned the room with nervous anticipation and see none other than the Officer Petrowski sitting there.  Since it was a drug related offense, on school property, a Police Officer had to be called to the scene.  By complete coincidence, it was MY D.A.R.E. OFFICER.  Lovely.    Of course, I was suspended from school, put on 'restrictions' by my parents (my mom refused to call it being grounded...she came up with her own term, as not to sound like the other moms), and forbidden to have any further contact with the skaters.    Now, the lesson of this story is obvious...JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS.    Nah, not really.  The lesson is, don't give people such high expectations of you, you'll just disappoint them.  Set your goals low, and they're easier to attain.  Oh yeah, and don't let your kids hang around the skaters.  Those kids are bad news.

       What is self confidence?    Last night I was having dinner with a friend, and I was discussing how much my life has changed in the last two years.  I realize that most of the people reading this know me well, but for those who don't, I lost nearly 50 pounds more than two years ago.   Back to the dinner discussion.  I was explaining to her that then (at 50 pounds heavier) I was trapped in a world with no self esteem and little confidence.  She responds (as many of my friends have to this comment) that she never saw me that way.  She saw me very differently.  A very confident, outgoing girl.  I find that interesting.  It was horrible, it was lonely, and it was dark.  And to think, I had all these people (including my closest friends) fooled into thinking I was this confident girl despite my obvious physical limitations.  How did I pull that off?  So my question, what is self confidence, really?  Is it something people truly feel, or is it just a way you are viewed by others?  As dramatically as my life has changed, as much as I like who I've become, as healthy as I feel...am I now truly self confident?  I suppose when it comes to issues of weight and body image (especially that of women), perhaps it can leave a scar that might possibly never heal.  But we all have our limitations, we all have things about ourselves that could be improved, or things we wish we were better at.  I suppose true self confidence is the ability to focus on the wonderful things about ourselves, and in turn, the world takes notice.  Okay, now an apology.  That sounded like Carrie Bradshaw's final thought in an episode of Sex & The City.

       MY MOM RULES, HERE'S WHY:  1. She is celebrating the 20 year anniversary of her current hairdo.  2. She has such an extensive collection of outdoor decor that we have developed a name for it.  We lovingly call it her 'yard art'. 3. As part of her 'yard art' collection she has a cactus garden planted between an iron headboard and footboard, with a painted sign placed in the garden that reads 'cactus bed'. 4. She has converted our family hot tub into a garden. 5. She has bright yellow traffic signs posted as you drive up to her home claiming 'rabbit crossing' and 'deer crossing'. 6. Call waiting still makes her nervous.  She is so scared of hanging up on someone that she will switch from her cordless phone to a regular phone before attempting to click over. 7. She has two outdoor cats, one black and one grey.  The black one is named midnight while the grey one is named smoke.  Makes perfect sense. 8. I credit her for bringing blue eye shadow back. 9. She owns and wears a pair of hightop Reeboks with velcro. 10. She can eat an entire watermelon in one sitting. 11. She can eat an entire gallon of Bluebell Vanilla Ice Cream in one sitting. 12. She still introduces her boyfriend of 5 years, who attends Christmas and Easter with the family, as her 'friend'. 13. She has such a remarkable, unconditional, unquestionable love for her family despite our mistakes and dysfunction.

       tonight i had dinner with the mom and the brother.  this is always enjoyable.   one, because my brother and i have a special, made up language which has a primary focus on the words abby, precious & no no.  these words are all formulated into normal sentences and pronounced in a high pitched tone with emphasis on certain syllables, and ending with the word 'side'.  really, there is no way to learn the language with the exception of much exposure and a minimum of a high school education.    but, primarily i enjoy this time because the dialogue and exchange of ideas and opinions is fucking hilarious.  we discussed many things this encounter, especially considering it had been some time since we 'caught up.'    first, there was the discussion of my personal life, with a focus on the dating aspect of this.  my brother's advice, "don't give up the milk too soon."  "you know the old saying amber, 'don't buy the cow if you can get the milk for free.'"  thanks wade, that's fucking great.  i'll keep that in mind.    the conversation's focus quickly turned to my brother.  i was informed that two nights ago in the wee hours of the morning, my mom kicked him out of her house (where he was currently living).  i asked him what he did following that and he replies, "well, first i called into work tired."  tired...really wade.  thank goodness you are the bosses son.  no need to enter the real world with sick time and annual evaluations when you can call into work tired.  amidst this, my brother asked if he could try my seared voodoo tuna.  i allow him a few slices, which he accepts and proceeds to dip in his queso and guacamole.  he has such sophisticated taste.  discussion turns back to my dating life.  i am explaining to my mom the astrological discovery of my deficiency in tact.  my mom's response:  "maybe that's why that one guy dumped you" to which i reply, "uh, screw you mom" to which she replies, "see."  i hate when she's right.  in closing, the mom reminded the brother (with subtle disappointment of him having had three beers with dinner) that the next time he gets a d.w.i. not to call her.

       my life is pretty normal, for the most part    (for those of you laughing, fuck off).    but different.....well, different builds character, right?    following (in no particular order) are actual moments in my life when i felt i had a good chance at a guest appearance on the jerry springer show:  1. there is the now infamous time my stepmother fooled grandma into eating a pot brownie disguised as a regular duncan hines brownie.  and yes, b had to stop the under 10 crowd from partaking as well.  now, in my defense, the plain brownies were clearly wrapped in pastel blue paper 2. waking up at the joyboy's house with a bag of fritos in one hand, bean dip in the other, and a chihuahua on my chest 3. the night my phone number had to be changed from 554-8771 to 825-3113 4. multiple highschool parties at the pop's house that led to:            a) boys locating my father's porn collection             b) gun shots being fired in the air (but only to frighten people)            c) robert jung waking up on the front sidewalk with pictures of my stepmother 5. romeo's waiter 6. getting a phone call from my boyfriend's girlfriend to tell me about her miscarriage 7. getting out of a d.w.i. after getting pulled over and forgetting to put the car in park, thanks to a special shirt 8. leaving with the officer's pager number, thanks to a special shirt 9. smoking pot with my uncle after my grandma (different grandma) encouraged us to smoke at her house rather than on the road, because "it would be much safer."  10. and finally, unlike jessie, pumpkins remind me of las vegas limo rides  note: the above moments have all received a four star or below rating on the trailer trash meter.  five star moments have been left out due to the severity of their content

       Breaking up sucks, but settling sucks even more.  I will never be one of those pathetic girls who stays in a fucked up relationship just to avoid being alone.  Not that I haven't had my share of dickheads, but I got out with only one more number to add to the list and another valuable lesson learned.  I believe in love (thanks to those of you who have let me witness your's) and I believe that if we are patient and don't settle, it will happen for you...and me too.  For all the ladies who need a great, inspiring song to help them through getting out of a fucked up situation, listen up.  Two different albums, two different artists, one song, equally as powerful.    urlLink Dixie Chicks   urlLink Patty Griffin    LET HIM FLY   Ain't no talkin' to this man Ain't no pretty other side Ain't no way to understand the stupid words of pride It would take an acrobat and I already tried all that I'm gonna let him fly  Things can move at such a pace The second hand just waved good-bye You know the light has left his face But can't recall just where or why So there was really nothing to it I just went and cut right through it I said I'm gonna let him fly  There's no mercy in a live wire No rest at all in freedom Choices we are given It's no choice at all The proof is in the fire You touch before it moves away-yeah  But you must always know  how long to stay and when to go   And there ain't no talkin' to this man He's been tryin' to tell me so It took a while to understand the beauty of just letting go 'Cause it would take an acrobat and I already tried all that  I'm gonna let him fly  urlLink   urlLink

       i know this man named scotty.  he is not someone i would normally associate myself with, but he is a maintenance man where i work.  scotty has an 8 foot by 10 foot texas flag hanging off his patio where he grows pot and listens to z102.  scotty has long red hair, a sterling silver skull ring, and wears sunglasses anytime he is awake.  today i walked into the office to find scotty constructing a huge sign that in plain black letters read "some people are alive simply because it's illegal to kill them."  he sees me watching him and in his redneck tone of voice says "propaganda for my fridge, man."  this is the same scotty that frequently reminds me "i'm not a racist, i hate everyone equally."  scotty cracks my ass up.

       my friend jantha, using my date and time of birth, did an in-depth profile of my personality.  the outcome was long and extensive, but the most meaningful part read as follows:   "You may be somewhat deficient in tact."

       i am so fucking sick of being snotty.  i am going on like day 10 of my body producing so much snot, i think my head is going to explode from being at snot capacity.    at first, it's kind of cute.  you know, you can do that sexy raspy voice thing.  okay, maybe cute is not the word for it.  there's really nothing cute about snot.  but come on.  enough is enough already.  i want the snot to go away.  and no, nicole.  i'm not sick.  nothing hurts.  no fucking way am i going to sit in a waiting room for 1 hour to tell the doctor i got snot.  "does anything hurt amber?" "no." "your throat doesn't hurt?" "no." "your head doesn't hurt?" "no." "well, amber, it looks like you got a bad case of snot.  that'll be twenty dollars."

       you know what agitates me to no end?  females who shake hands which such delicacy, you feel like their hand's going to snap off at the bone.  pussy handshakes...that's what i call them.  i get to shake a lot of hands in the industry i work in, and have come to discover for myself that handshakes tell a lot about this person you are fixing to take the landlord/tenant journey with.    you weak, submissive, spineless female.  you bug me.  next time i go to shake your hand i'd rather you put your head down, slouch your shoulders and hide behind your husband.  i'll get the same message.  i'll get the point.

       we had just taken the entrance ramp onto IH35 when i look in the rear view mirror to see parker sniffing the air.  "wade, what is he smelling" i ask?  "oh, i just farted."  and that was it.  the kick off to thanksgiving madness.  my brother, the stalker: as we are driving along amusing one another with tidbits of our current lives, wade points out that the girl in the vehicle next to us was staring at him.  "i'm sure you get that a lot" i joke.  "yeah, especially since i've been staring at her for a few minutes and she noticed."  i was just happy that he wasn't making us listen to his typical road-trip requests of christian music or tapes of sermons.    my dog, the best and worst boyfriend ever: it's getting harder and harder to deny the fact that parker is more like a jealous, needy boyfriend rather than a dog.  i mean, it's not that weird that in the car he always has his paw reached across the emergency brake so that he can be touching me.  but i get so much grief for the fact that if i leave the room for a minute and don't allow him to follow me that he lets out a continuous, under his breath whine the entire time of my absence.  or that i am not allowed to associate with any other animal, including cows and horses, without him getting extremely upset and jealous.  my mom, the technology guru: my grandmother has leaped into the 21st century and purchased a cell phone.  my mom, who is still confused by her cell phone after owning it for going on 4 years, is ready and willing to share her cell phone wisdom with my grandma.  she starts by spending the next 20 minutes programming a total of three phone numbers in it.  so the feature doesn't go to waste, she wants to make certain that grandma knows good and well how to operate it.  best way to do this, role playing.  she points out to grandma which buttons to push and in which order, then had my grandma practice by calling the house.  my dad, the bully: grandparents are good for a lot of things.  one of those things, hearing stories about your parents when they were young.  although i had some knowledge of my dad's past days of partaking in a rumble or two, i got two more stories to add to my collection of passed down memories.  my new favorite:  my grandma gets a call that he has stuffed a small kid (and by small kid, i mean a midget) in a locker at school.  i then, naturally, request more stories.  they are at the grocery store.  my grandma slips and falls.  one of the teenage grocery clerks starts laughing at her.  my dad, her son in shining armor, walks over and clocks the dude in the face.  my great-grandma, the 101 year old miracle: she truly is.  she is 101.  she is a miracle.  since my dad has been absent for the last 8 years, they spent time chatting and catching up.  she was explaining to my dad that she no longer drives, since she turned 100 and all.  "i was planning on quitting at 90, but then i just went ahead and went an extra 10 years."  mind you it was within the city limits of poth, texas.  her two destinations: church and the old folks home to visit the 'old' people that are 20 and 30 years younger than she.  currently, our miracle still lives on her own, loving life in her home of seventy-something years.  she still has her health, her mind, her wit, her memory, and her unbelievable presence.  my grandma, from the alcoholic side of my family: after fifty-something years of drug and alcohol abuse, she is recently experiencing some major health problems.  of course, us being her family and all, want her to take care of herself and quit drinking.  she thinks that if she pours the beer in a different (clear) glass, we won't realize it is beer.  me, who's eyes are bigger than my stomach: we had five different kinds of pies.  i wanted to try all five.  so i did.  i ate pie until i thought i was going to vomit.  then i waited an hour and ate more pie.    i know if your thanksgiving was 1/3 as good as mine, you are still smiling from ear to ear.  cheers to family and all that it means.

       it's weird.  in relationships (romantic & friendship), i tend to be a bit possessive and have somewhat of a jealous streak (it's the taurus in me).  although it seems to be true in all my relationships, it becomes undeniably apparent in my boyfriend/girlfriend type relationships.  however, for the last year - on and off - i have been involved with a young man that all my typical rules of attraction seem non-existent.    we see each other when our schedules are compatible.  no strings attached.  i am somewhat busy, he is very busy.  it usually works out that we will talk every other week or so, and see one another once a month or so.  in the down time, i don't get those typical feelings of 'why hasn't he called'?  it's not that the attraction is not there, but somehow i can embrace him when he is present, but completely disown my feelings for him when he is not.  he has a great soul.  he is a thoughtful lover.  he is interesting, unique, talented, sweet & respectful.  he is also very young & immature.  i don't see a future with him, and from the looks of the progression of our relationship thus far, i don't believe he sees one either.  we've never really had 'the conversation' or asked one another for anything more than what has been offered.  sometimes i wonder if i'm really okay with the situation, and sometimes i have friends question if i'm really okay with it, especially considering this has not been typical amber operation.  i was thinking the other day about how i feel things so deeply.  when i have an emotion, any emotion, i can feel it through my entire body.  it consumes me.  but somehow, with this guy, i am able to shut it off.  i honestly don't usually put that much thought into this.  however, after spending a fantastic night with him this weekend i read my horoscope, and now cannot stop thinking about it and trying to figure out what the reality of the situation is:   Dear AMBER, Here is your horoscope for Saturday, November 22:  Indecision masquerades as extremism. Taurus sets up an elaborate diversion to keep reality at a distance. Imagine what you could do if you poured all this energy into the right channel.    BTW, my friends, don't think i've gone off the deep end.  i don't live or die by my horoscopes.  but sometimes i find them interesting, and thought provoking.  am i really okay with casual relationships?  or even more so, am i really okay with long-term casual relationships?  am i really okay with this?  am i disguising feelings?  i've honestly felt okay with it up to this point, but maybe all this thought is my hearts way of saying that it is time to pour my energy into something that might prove more fruitful.

       favorite part of the party last night: gina lent us her karaoke machine, but forgot to include the c.d.'s.  the only one we had was the one left in the changer: soul classics.  jessica sang  when a man loves a woman  as dramatically as possible.  her performance included crawling across the floor on her hands and knees.  primarily the microphones were used for beer pong commentary.  i woke up this morning in my panties and bra, with a trail of clothes and shoes from the front door to my bed.  thank you beer pong and jello shots.  thank you. -------- the new guacamole doritos taste like cool ranch doritos

       Dear Santa Claus, I am not sure how old is too old to be writing you a letter, but with the stores filling up with Christmas goodness and the planning of holiday parties, I can't help but have you on my mind.  I feel like, in comparison with other years, this year I have been an exceptionally good girl.  This is not to say I have not had my skanky moments or random encounters, but I think we can both agree that they have been fewer and farther between than previous years.  I feel like with my efforts I should be rewarded with some of the below items on this years Christmas' wish list.  I will get you back with the usual pot cookies, served in an assortment of flavors, including the peanut butter ones I know Rudolph is such a fan of, along with some Cheetos and Funyuns for the sleigh munchies.  1.  urlLink Dog Translator  2.  urlLink Bidet  3.  urlLink T-shirt  (and one of these for jantha too, please) 4.  urlLink Christian Panties  5.  urlLink Swimsuit  (preferably the culotte swimmer) 6. Batteries 7. Anything from the  urlLink apple bottom  line  Santa, one other thing.  Nicole and Todd have had a hard time lately being the model parents we've all known them to be (I'm sure you're fully aware that they forgot to play the role of tooth fairy not once, but twice, and forgot their youngest kid's birthday).  If you could help them out in making this Christmas one their kids won't soon forget, and keep them from having to invest thousands of dollars in support groups and counseling and in the words of Chris Rock "from robbin' me in ten years".  Love, Amber

       Today, I sit at work, un-showered and sleep deprived.  Last night was an amazing time, accompanied by my friend's bisexual little sister and her ready and willing girlfriend.  Ricky, boy I have a hopeless crush on, took us to  urlLink Flamingo Cantina , a favorite spot of his on sixth street (home of cheap beer and underage drinkers).  I felt, at moments, like I was in a Sean Paul video.  How fun to just sit and watch how these people can move.  Their rhythm amazes me.  Now, I am over the club scene, but if you are looking for a unique Austin experience, and to see some brothers shake what their mammas gave them, this is a must do.

       Last night after happy hour, I found some aged pot (oh, I'd say 6+ months old) in my apartment.  Moments later, I was in my winter gear, complete with a scarf, hat, and mittens dancing in my living room alone.  May this be a good indication as to how this weekend will play out.  Ready, set, go.

       why oh why?  what did we do as females to deserve pre-menstrual symptoms?  it fuckin' sucks.  and for those guys reading this who think it's all a big joke, fuckyouyou'reacocksucker.  it's real, and the fact that on a typical day i don't even think about touching the cookies we serve at my office, but during this time of the month i can consume 6 in a row, in a time span of less than 3 minutes, proves that this is not just an attention-getting-excuse-to-be-bitchy-scheme.  and you know what freaks me out more than the torture of being pre-menstrual?  the fact that me, and the ladies in my office have worked together for so long that we now menstruate at the same fucking time.  wtf?  it's creepy.  i'd rather have the bond of scarve wearing and career apparel matching with them.

       oh no, now look what i have done for myself.  i've given the expectation of a daily post, now i'm getting threat emails and demand letters (don't worry, i know, i'm just flattering myself).  so, here goes. this is where my thoughts are this day: -------- have you seen the new show on mtv,  urlLink  rich girls  ?  b, i know you're with me on this one.  it's fabulous.  tommy hilfiger's big-teef daughter, and her really, really rich and really, really ugly and really, really dumb friend prance around manhattan shopping and surprising the cameras with their astounding intellect.  last night, one of the two, was discussing her love and eye for good fashion.  she remarked that she recently selected to wear tight cargo pants with stilletos as a real fashion statement, while "people in the mid-west wear cargo pants because they need all those pockets."  and they must wear ball caps to keep the sun out of their eyes too, dumbass.  and you thought jessica simpson was the dumbest girl on MTV.  rich girls take this award by a lot.   be prepared to be amused, nonetheless. -------- nicknames are wonderful & telling.  sometimes telling about the nickname-ee, sometimes about the nickname-er  amber-roni ferris wheel (carey) amberlina (jantha) amberlicious (myself, in regard to my stripper identity) amberside (jessie, brian, sarah) precious (robert) ambie pambie (dad) amberlou (carrie) princess (gina) pookie (jessie, brian, sarah) precious, is that you side? (brother) am (kaley) biscuit (amy)  sugar boogar (mom) (okay, not really.  but i wish she would.)

       saturdays are for fun...and for blog material.  which is as follows:  i swear football is such a homo-sport.  now, mind you i can find sexual connotation in just about anything, but after watching the u.t. game last night, i am convinced that this sport is gayer than a two dollar bill.  first of all, the obvious.  they wear itty bitty pants and touch one another's asses way too often (what happened to a good 'ole pat on the back?).  in addition, throughout the game, they use words like tight end, penetration, receiver, sack, and toss.  it's just not right for such a testosterone driven sport.  and i can't say that it didn't bother me that there were players named symen and peters.   earlier that same day:  lacey and company want to have their cards read.  amber wants to tag along to humor herself.  portion of conversation between card reader & victim is as follows:  card reader: have you lost a child? victim: no card reader: has someone in your family lost a child? victim: (hesitates) ummmm, no card reader: okay, has there been a death in your family? a death of any kind? victim: (thinking) no card reader: i'm seeing some kind of loss, like a death. victim: i'm not sure what that could be? card reader: okay, maybe it's a loss of something else.  it doesn't necessarily have to be a death. victim: (confused look) card reader: maybe a loss of an emotion, or a sensation? victim: hmmmm, i have no idea. card reader: again, i'm seeing some kind of loss.  later on in reading.....  victim: i just moved to austin from minneapolis.  i miss my family. card reader: that's it, that's your loss.  i knew there was a loss.   i'm a believer.  really,  i am.

       discussion on dating:  friend asks "does he like parker?"  i say "yes, of course."  friend responds "you don't think we're doing anything detrimental to parker by bringing all of these men in and out of his life, do you?"    btw, the friend always regards all my interests, activities, & social life as "ours" "we're" "us".  she likes to live vicariously through me, so this is her way of being included.

       I've never been one of those girls who put much thought into what my wedding would be like, or how many kids I would have, or what I would name them.  Maybe because I was such a late bloomer as far as dating and boys goes (however, not in the boob department.  I left middle school in a C cup).  One day I think I would maybe like kids of my own.  But in the mean time, until I find someone willing to reproduce with me and that I would be willing to procreate with, I am certainly satisfied with the sporadic encounters with the offspring of my friends.  And these encounters are always a good reminder to me that I am certainly NOT ready for full-time kids.  I don't kidsit often, but last time I did, I made the mistake of suggesting my apartment as the childcare center.    A couple of notes in regards to this:   1. Keep the kids in their environment  2. A one bedroom apartment is too small for an adult, a dog, and three children (I don't care what other cultures say)  3. My apartment is not a kid friendly apartment (childproof outlet covers & childproof cabinet locks are not all that is necessary to make your home safe)  The evening started out okay, but progressively got worse.  We began with a 30 minutes cruise around the parking lot with the convertible top down.  They were overzealous and filled with joy for the entire half hour, and I began to think 'I'm not so bad at this kid thing, they're safe, they're entertained, they're having an experience they've never had, and they think I'm cool.  This is great.'    Now, back at my apartment.  2 1/2 hours left until the parents would be back to reclaim them.  At first I allowed them reign of the entire apartment.  About 15 minutes later, I blocked access to the bedroom and bathroom.  Soon after, they were no longer allowed in the office.  Before long, the rules had been set.  They were allowed to play in a 6 foot x 6 foot radius (basically, not even the entire living room...I didn't want them on the couches or near the big screen).  Nicole, don't read anything in the parenthesis.  It was fun (not really) and I look forward to the next time I get to kidsit (not really), and I was really sad to send them home when Todd and Nicole returned (not really).  What got me thinking about kids, you ask?  Nicole called me to tell me that Faith, her youngest, woke up this morning wanting edemame for breakfast.  She also told me Todd, her middle child, pronounces it edemamapea.  Amandee, oldest, never calls it the same thing twice.  One thing I find constantly amusing about kids is their vocabulary.  I love the words they choose to use and the way they pronounce words they are learning.  This is endlessly fascinating to me.  Nicole knows this and is good at relaying these pronunciations to me.  story behind edemame: The other day Nicole stopped by to visit me at work with Faith.  I was eating edemame when they stopped by, and like most children, Faith wanted to have what I was having.  So I allowed her a few.  An entire bag later, she was hooked.  A few weeks later, all three of her kiddos are fans.  The other thing I'm amused by, children's ability to believe.  Sure, as adults, we believe, but not without question.  This is another post, another day.  Too many tangents in this.    The end.

       Okay, happier thoughts.  The blog got too heavy for a moment there, need to have a more light-hearted post.  As many of you know (and constantly tease me for, thankyouverymuch) I am required to wear a uniform at work.  Our uniforms do not consist of things I would typically wear and put me way out of my clothing comfort zone.  We purchase our uniforms, or 'career apparel' as I like to call it, at Casual Corner, a store I had never stepped foot in prior to this requirement.  There are key pieces of my career apparel that make me feel like such a professional.  I reluctantly admit that my favorite pieces of the career apparel are the two vests I sport more than anything else (one of which I am wearing today), and the three scarves that give me such a feeling of authority.  I never realized just how many ways there were to tie scarves...it really makes getting ready for work fun and creative.  In addition to my amusement of scarves, we always get a little giggle at work when a co-worker shows up in the same thing you've opted to wear that day.  We stand real close to each other and say something cute like "ha, we're twinkies."  It's like a special bond that only you and that person share all day long.  At least we have moved away from ordering out of a catalog.  Last summer we wore shorts that verged on being culottes.  We wore tapered button-up shirts with the almost-culottes.  We alternated between hot pink, bright green, and white shirts.  We also wore socks and loafers.  I looked like a cross between a camp counselor and girl scout, minus the whistle.  P.S.  Numerous times I have told my boss that I would have a much higher closing ratio if she would allow me to select my clothing.  I'm sure that push-up bras and short skirts would get more results.

       in my moment of sadness, i called my mom for some reassurance, like only moms can give.  she consoled me and reminded me (in such an un-biased motherly way) that i was wonderful, deserving, and how she wished she could be with me and hold me.  then, she said the most precious thing.  i was listening to david gray.  she heard it in the background, and told me to turn the music off because it was making me more sad.  i told her i would, but she refused to get off the phone with me until she heard me comply and turn the music off "no, i'm not letting you go until you walk over there and turn the music off and turn on cartoons.  do it now."

       hello, my name's amber, and i'm an alcoholic.     okay, so i don't really drink anymore, except when i drink.  then i drink.  but other than that, i don't drink.  but about once a week or so, i crave alcohol.  especially margaritas.     keep coming back, it works if you work it.

       decisions.  the ones you have to live or die by.  those are the worst.  you make them, you can't take them back, you're stuck with them.  eventually, they sink in.  the feeling goes away.  but then, with no notice at all, it all comes flooding back.  the consequences.  the feelings.  the emotions.  fuck, i hate it.  i want it to go away.  i want to be able to talk to a friend and it all to feel better.  i want to shower and it to wash all the yuckiness away.  i want to fall asleep and not toss and turn.  but it's inevitable.  it's life.  decisions, they are what we live and die by.

       nothing surprises me anymore.  my mom just invited my dad to join us at my grandparents for thanksgiving, since this is his first holiday as a single man and all.  for those of you who don't know our family dynamics, this is a huge step.  i wonder if after 8 years my dad will still be comfortable passing gas in front of my grandparents?  i've said it before, and i'll say it again.  my mom is amazing!

       Radio stations are on my shit list.  I hate them.  Not only do we have to suffer through the same playlists over and over again, but they torture us with annoying d.j.'s (especially on the hip hop stations) and horrible commercials.  But the worst thing about radio stations, the thing that I find completely irritating, is when they play brief bits from some of their more frequently played hits just to give you a snapshot of what their station is about - followed by some annoying commentary.  The songs they choose are usually catchy, and despite my distaste for radio programming, the catchy beats usually catch my attention, only to disappoint me with a five second tease.  It's bullshit.

       i hate the constraint of time.  my boss told me today that i have no concept of it, and pointed out that she has never known me to wear a watch.  in her words, "when it comes to time, you're out there" (waiving her arms in the air to help me visualize this).  i realize that in life i have no choice.  time is essential.  everything revolves around time.  'what time is it?'  'what time do we need to be there?'  'what time does the show come on?'  'what time does the movie start?'  'what time do you get off work?'  i hate it.  i absolutely hate it.  but i guess i just need to quit my bitchin' and suck it up.  cause time ain't going away.  at this time, i have to go.  it's almost time to get off work.

       So, I have had this slight reputation in the past (with a lot of emphasis on *the past*) for bad boys.  Not the cowboy, saloon fight, pistol carrying kind of bad boy.  More like the 'I can't get my shit together to save my life and now definitely won't because I have this girl here who will put up with me just the way I am' kind of bad boy.  I know this is a common thing with females, and I have certainly had my share. More recently, with my new found self esteem and expectations, have come to understand why that was.  I know now that it was not my attraction to bad boys, it was my feeling of lack of worth for the good ones.  But what a lesson to learn.  I don't regret any of the relationships I chose to pursue.  I learned so much about me, about other people, what I want, and for sure what I don't want.  Now I'm ready.  I've had enough brief encounters with the good ones to know.  I am ready for the good one.  And it's oh so much better.

       i just had a prospect come in to look around our community.  after she introduced and referred to her fiance three times as "her fiance" i turned to him and asked "so, do you have an actual name, or do you just go by fiance?"  i'm not very nice.  ****** my co-worker and i normally have our periods simultaneously.  this month, hers has been abnormal, and is convinced it is due to the eclipse.

       My upstairs neighbor has to come to my apartment every few weeks or so and ask me to turn down my music.  I always joke with him that instead of complaining about the volume, he should just call down and make requests, like a radio station.  I will even give away fun prizes like movie tickets or cozies.  Or better yet, I've asked that he start contributing to the price of my c.d. collection.  It's not fair that he gets to benefit from my expenditures.  I realize that I am an employee of this complex, and should be setting an example for other residents to follow, but I'm no good at that.  Being a role model has never really been my cup of tea.  Which brings me to my next thought.  Last night I was discussing how I would like to volunteer for something, you know, give back to the world.  I've considered big brothers, big sisters, but I'm not all that crazy about kids and I curse too much.  Andrea suggested some organization where you answer a hotline for battered women, but I know I would suck at that.  I'm too much of the mentality that when you're in a shitty relationship, you get the fuck out.  I don't think these women would prefer hearing that in their time of need and desperation.  P.S.  Why is it that when you do the spell check in the Blog program, it always highlights the word "fuck" and suggests the words "fugi" and "fuzz" as a replacement.  Seriously, can I get the word fuck added to Blogger's dictionary of words?  It's annoying.  In amber-land "fuck" is just as valid a word as any other word.

       You know how a lot of couples will use the word 'we' when one of the two parties is explaining a story or preference?  Is it wrong that I frequently do the same, except the other half of 'we' is Parker?  ****** I think the first sign that you're getting older is when it takes you 2-3 days to recover from a night of drinking and no sleep.  ****** There was a big focus on the word "creamy" this weekend.  ****** Industry terms are fun.

         THE POWER OF A COMPLIMENT    We do not compliment one another enough.  It's not that these positive, favorable thoughts about others don't enter into our minds.  But, for some reason, we aren't apt to share these thoughts with the person in which the compliment is intended.  We are much more likely to express dissatisfaction with someone, what we don't like, what we think they should change.  Why is that?  Compliments go a long way.  They make us feel so good.  They reinforce.  They remind.  They boost.  Heck, sometimes they completely change our day.  Please help me in my efforts to make complimenting as popular as low-rise jeans.

       my dad is an interesting character.  he has owned his own business for twenty something years, and sometimes allows his business persona to overflow into his personal life.  sometimes after time spent together, he shakes my hand and thanks me "for doing business with him."  last night he had to cancel our planned excursion to dinner and a movie because "he had a meeting with ms. bradley to finalize some of the details of the break-up."    at the end of our conversation, my dad thanked me for being his daughter and for being just the way i was.  i reminded him that it was because of my parents that i am the way i am.  childhood was not easy, but adulthood has become so simple thanks to the example my parents have displayed that human change is not only necessary, but with hardwork and effort, totally feasible.  my dad has overcome more in his lifetime than most humans are capable of.  abandonment, poverty, juvenile delinquency, physical abuse, verbal abuse, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, debt, depression, divorce.    my dad wasn't always the best dad.  my dad didn't always do the things that dads are supposed to do.  my dad didn't always treat us the way dads are supposed to treat their families.  my dad didn't always make the right decisions for himself or his family.  but my dad conquered his demons.  he overcame odds.  he turned his life around.  he had a vision that he would never live the way he did as a young street thug without a father and an alcoholic, drug addict, abusive mother, without money to eat, without examples set, without boundaries, without reason for living or happiness.  today he is successfully reaping the benefits of the empire he has created and has for some 12 years now lived 100% free of the fog created by drug and alcohol abuse.  he is generous with his wealth (both emotional and financial), he is in love with his family, he is aware of his blessings, and he is an example.  this, among other reasons, is why i admire him.

       little league baseball is such a funny thing.  as with a lot of organized groups for children, the parents tend to be a little more passionate about it than the children the group is intended for.  i was talking to nicole and she informed me that yesterday todd was voted in as the vice president of the baseball organization they have elected for their children to be a part of (i believe nicole already serves as secretary).  being nicole's best friend, i frequently get to hear the latest baseball saga.    little johnny's dad always lets him play first base.  bobby always gets put in the outfield.  suzy wants us to buy a $15,000 tractor that we don't need.  kelly's mom was asked to leave the park because she was dressed too promiscuously.  henry thinks they charge too much for nachos at the concession stand.  so on and so forth.  i tease her that the goings on at the ballpark are much like a soap opera set at a suburban baseball field.  i would like to come up with the perfect name for our soap opera, and will introduce to the blogheads the ones i've come up with thus far:    as the ballpark turns guiding coaches sunset ballpark general ballpark days of our ballpark the ballpark and the beautiful one ballpark to live the ballpark and the restless all my ballparks

       i was discussing today's post with a friend.  the friend is considering running for a political office, so i won't mention her name.  she commented that it was funny that i knew someone with the last name duve, because that was a french word for a toilet that sprays water on your butt.  i quickly realized her mistake. she was confusing 'duve' with the word 'bidet' (webster defines as "a bathroom fixture used especially for bathing the external genitals and the posterior parts of the body").  but the conversation on bidets didn't stop there.  the friend began speaking in her quiet 'i'm at work and fixing to say something really nasty' voice.  "you know, i hear that if you position yourself just right on one of those, you can get an orgasm."  so, for christmas, i would like a bidet please.

       today on good morning america (yes, i'm like my grandparents in that i thoroughly enjoy this program, especially diane sawyer.  i can't put my finger on it, i just really, really like her), they were doing a piece on people (namely pilots) who now have constant ringing in their ears as a result of their professions.  i can't recall what the disorder is called, but nonetheless, it got me thinking about hearing disorders.  in particular, it got me thinking about my friend kaley.    kaley is a close childhood friend of mine, who also happens to be the daughter of two deaf parents.  her father was born deaf and her mother became deaf as a child after suffering from german measles (i believe).  they are such wonderful people, who live life to the fullest despite this life-altering condition.  mrs. duve has maintained a job for 25+ years for the state of texas.  mr. duve was forced to retire some 10 years ago due to some major back problems.  they brought into their world 4 hilariously unique children (all hearing) and now have been blessed with 7 grandchildren (i think, i lost count after 7).  their home was an open door.  anyone was welcome there.  not just their many children and grandchildren (believe me, there have been many times when all of the above have lived in the duve house at the same time).  there was nothing more amusing to me than being one of the handfull of hearing people in a room with 20 deaf people moaning and stomping to get one another's attention and signing at the speed of lightning.  considering manchaca, texas was a really small town to grow up in, our friend network was very small, and we were all extremely close, practically from birth.  i used to spend a good deal of time at the duve household where i would always be greeted with a welcoming smile from mrs. duve and a noogie from mr. duve.  what the parents lacked in volume, the kids made up for.  i'm convinced through knowing the duve's that children of deaf parents are perhaps the loudest people known to man.  perhaps my fondest memory of the duve's is that of mr. duve.  this family loved to go out to eat, and i frequently accompanied them.  whenever we would dine somewhere that there was a long wait, mr. duve would approach the hostess stand.  when they would attempt to explain to him that the wait would be whatever the wait was, he would pretend to be confused and act like he couldn't understand what was going on.  with almost a 100% success rate, mr. duve would get us seated in less than 10 minutes.  i would just stand in the background and laugh my ass off.  funny, funny shit.   i miss them.

       Kids, I have made two November (pre-new year) resolutions.  Here, I will make my small blog audience aware of my resolutions, in case you see me pigging out on a 4 course meal or wishing I had that new Porshe, you can remind me of blog entry dated November 5th, 2003.  As Ellen DeGeneres would say, I'm bringing resolutions back to daytime.  Resolution #1 I have began an eating regimen that involves eating 6 small meals a day (every 2 hours or so).  With this eating schedule, I will still maintain a menu excluding starch and sugar that I have lived on and off of for the last three years.  Yes, I realize I am late on this bandwagon, and that fitness gurus have been advising the general public that this is the way to go for years now.  But there you have it.  I am going to go against my genetic odds and fix my fucking metabolism once and for all!  Now, hopefully this is not just "post-vacation I ate like a fucking starving pig depression."  Historically, I have been able to really discipline myself into making the right food choices...and I certainly hope that this time history will repeat itself.  Resolution #2 I am going to stop wanting what I don't have.  I sincerely feel that I have had an extremely blessed life, both with material possessions, family and friends.  But despite this recognition and genuine appreciation, I constantly desire more.  I am going to strive for satisfaction with what has been bestowed upon me.  I want to concentrate on not frivolously spending money and appreciating my family and friends, despite what they may lack or what they have done in the past.  Sheryl Crow said it best in her cheesy, happy, make you wanna put on sunblock and run around outside song, "It's not knowing what you want, but wanting what you have."  ***I appreciate your attention to this less than exciting entry.

       i have received a lot of remarks that i am not featured in any of the los angeles pictures.  i am not certain how this happened, but i have a lot of theories.  one of those theories is NOT that i was the photographer, for that was brian's role (who did manage to make it into several pictures)?    1. i was never really in los angeles, it was all my imagination 2. brian secretly hates me or thinks i'm ugly 3. brian did take pictures of me, but has sold them to a top modeling agency 4. pictures were taken of me, but due to the high volume of alcohol consumed, either the roll was lost or the pictures were taken out of focus and unable to be developed 5. brian is using the pictures as masturbation material 6. the girl scouts of america have intercepted the pictures due to the illegal use and  degradation of their uniforms  brian?

       For those of you who have been anxiously awaiting my arrival, I am home safe & sound from my mini-vacation.  It was a very pleasant, low-key trip with a primary focus on consuming.  Where our next meal would be enjoyed was often the topic of discussion, plus about 10 trips to  urlLink The Coffee Bean .  ----- side note:  I love locally owned, non-franchised businesses as much as the next Austin granola head.  And as much as I want to 'Keep Austin Weird', mark my word, I will bring The Coffee Bean to this town and give Starbucks a run for their money.  That place has the bomb coffee and tea. ----- Brian has posted the pictures from my trip on shutterfly.   urlLink Click here  to take a peek.  The first few are of Robert trying on his children's Scooby-Doo costume for us (we only left him alone in Walgreens for five minutes).  Robert works at the bar we went to on Halloween night.  It was quite a sight to see him kicking a drunk gay man out of the bar wearing this.  I also had the pleasure of meeting Brian's wonderful, entertaining friends Roxie (the beat up Hooters girl) and Lauren (the big-eyed girl in the afro).  The other pictures are of our amazing trip to the  urlLink J. Paul Getty Museum .  It was a beautiful day with fantastic company.  I was very pleased that both my flights, to and from Los Angeles were on time.    Some airplane commentary:   -I love that the pilot always comes on the loudspeaker to tell you what altitude the plane is flying at...as if it makes a flip of a difference to the passengers.   -The magazine Southwest provides in the front pocket for our reading pleasure is getting better and better.  No longer just a sky mall, duty free catalog.  It has actual stories and shit. -Is it just me, or do you also feel a little guilt, maybe even hesitation, when preparing to lean your chair back the few inches they allow you? -I snuck tweezers on the plane with me...isn't that supposed to be one of the forbidden carry-ons? -Why is it that they require you to keep your seat belt on while seated?  Would it really save your life?  Does turbulence ever get that bad?  I don't understand. -I always feel dirty (need a shower dirty, not Christina Aguilera dirty) when I leave a bowling alley, a thrift store, and when I get off an airplane. -People smell bad.   What a delightful trip, but I am glad to be home sweet home, and with my sweet Parker again.

       so, due to the pot brownie consumption and the pouring rain, halloween ended up being a pretty subdued event.  after inhaling some jack in the crack, and catching a fantastic re-run of oprah, i think we were in bed by 1 am.  nice.  today is an amazingly perfect day in los angeles.  brian is fixing to suck it up, quit bitchin' about his headache (apparently motherloads doesn't believe in putting mixers in their cocktails), and take us to an outdoor museum.  yipppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  smile, no complaints.  life is good.

       i'm not completely convinced that the holidays are nothing more than the devil's evil scheme to get a lot of people crammed in a house during the sickest, germiest season of the year.  if my theory is true, the devil is doing a tap dance in hell right now....cause i have the motherfucking flu.  fuck, shit, damnit.  my doctor (whom i love because she is a bit of a hippy, wears birkenstocks & cut-off pants) gave me the new 'flu test', that now accurately tests one for the flu with a simple swab of snot from the nostril.  after the positive result, she goes into the explanation of how the flu takes 7 - 10 days to run its course and is a viral infection, hence an antibiotic will not help such an infection.  now me, being a reasonably intelligent gal, know this and the difference between a viral and bacterial infection.  but i could tell by her explanation and her question "are you comfortable with me not prescribing you an antibiotic?" that she gets a lot of shit from patients and your everyday moron that is helping in our societies growing immunity to this over-prescribed cure of BACTERIAL infections.  it's kind of scary, i almost got the vibe from her that all i had to do was ask for the antibiotic despite her diagnosis, and my wish shall be granted.  not wanting any unnecessary or useless medication in my body, i told her i fully understood and asked what to do from here?  she suggested a new product, tamiflu, that must be taken in the first 48 hours of the patient's first symptom.  since i was right on the cusp of this time-frame, she went ahead and gave me the prescription to get filled at my discretion.  considering i MUST BE WELL by wednesday night, i opted to get the medication, with hopes of a miracle (which i recently learned that there are people employed at the vatican whoms job description is to research and determine if something is indeed a miracle or not).  a couple of quick notes on my trip to the walgreen's pharmacy:  1) they tell me it will take 30-45 minutes to fill.  fuck that shit, you don't make a bitch with the flu wait in your fucking store for 30-45 minutes.  that's bullshit, and i told them so.  2) since i'd never taken this medication before the 'pharmacist' needed to have a consultation with me.  which consisted of a pimply faced young man in a mumbley, very unprofessional tone say "uh, really, uh, all i need to tell you is to take this twice a day for five days."  thank goodness in case i'm a fucking illiterate retard you were here to tell me that.  3) of course, you all knew this question was coming out of my mouth..."um, yeah, how does this medication react with alcohol?"  the pharmacist's response "well, uh, it supposedly lessens the effect of the drug.  but it, uh, doesn't completely wipe out the effects enough so that you shouldn't, uh, drink."  awesome, you idiot.  i shall drink then.  ah hell, at least the idiot told me what i wanted to hear.  now, i eat chicken noodle soup.

       Unfulfilled.    My very best friend told me tonight "you're the most social person I've ever known, yet you're the loneliest."  She's right.  I hate it.  I absolutely hate it.  My mom told me a few days ago "I know sometimes you feel alone, so so alone.  But you never are.  I am always here.  Always."  She's right.  I'm lucky.  I'm absolutely lucky.  Less is more.  That's how the saying goes.  I disagree.  More is more.  And I wan't more.    Tonight I pretended that I fell asleep in my true love's arms.  Fast asleep.  The kind of comfortable deep sleep you can only achieve in the presence of absolute peace.  I'm oh so ready to be fulfilled.  Bring it.

       well, my friends, the time has come.  the ole merry christmas post.  in just one hour parker and i will be packing up the car (okay, i'll be packing, parker will just be franticly wiggling his tail and studying my every move) and heading off to divide my time evenly between the two parental units.    it's funny, the colossal difference between my mom and dad and my constant astonishment that they, at one time, selected one another as their mate.  they must of been hopped up on some serious drugs when they decided to enter matrimony with eachother.  no other time of the year better exemplifies their different approach to life than the holidays.  but, nonetheless, i certainly love, treasure and appreciate what each offers and the unique time spent with both.  i know my christmas will be perfect, as it always seems to be, and i certainly hope everyone else's will be delightful as well.  i hope your day is filled with christmas goodness and that everyone goes home with all they wished for and wonderful memories too.    merry christmas to all and to all a merry christmas.

       aside from making copies of our asses on the copying machine, we've exhausted all forms of entertainment within the guidelines of our employee handbook.  we've eaten all the free goodies that vendors have brought to us, seen every item being sold on overstock.com, watched every episode of the newlyweds and rich girls, flipped through every catalog from l l bean to j crew - and frankly we're sick of sitting idly and looking at one another.  it is painfully slow today, and all that keeps me smiling is knowing that christmas is on the horizon.  conversations with co-workers reach new heights during these episodes of boredom.  the most recent conversation began with amy suggesting a new scent of massage oil being sold at bath & body works.  i commented that the said fragrance sounded lovely, however i lacked one key element needed in order for a successful massage - a warm body of the opposite sex to spoil with such delights.  her response "well, not yet amber."  i agreeably said true, but then had to share with her my thoughts on pre-purchased massage paraphernalia or sexual devices of any sort, for that matter.  i would find it odd and uncomfortable to begin a relationship with someone, and once reaching *that* level with them, busting out with stuff purchased during either a) a previous sexual relationship or b) any down-time.  in addition, if the new guy presented me with such devices,  i would find it equally as odd.  this is not to say i am against incorporating any such enhancers in to my relationship, it's just that i think it is important for my own wandering mind (and perhaps for sanitary reasons) that these all be bought for the sole purpose of enhancing OUR relationship.  merry christmas eve eve, pookies!!!

       things i learned this weekend:  1. how to make homemade kahlua with everclear 2. that you can never do too many shots of homemade kahlua 3. to no longer park under big tree in front of the trudys on burnet road - my car is now covered in over 100 bird terds 4. i hate birds and anything else that cannot control where their shit lands 5. sarah DOES NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE like men who use smiley faces in their emails 6. sangria margaritas on the rocks (as opposed to frozen) are yummy 7. no longer attempt to teach parker tricks when intoxicated - there is a better chance of peace in iraq than him actually retaining anything 8. there are too many references to alcohol in my blog   p.s.  b and i were having a conversation this weekend about x-boyfriends and why you should not continue having contact with them after the break-up (with the exception of the 1-3 months of break-up sex of course).  i explained to him that it is rare for me to continue contact with anybody i dated for any substantial amount of time, because after we break-up, i pretend they're dead.  talking would only remind me that they are still breathing and carrying on with out me.  the fact that they can still get out of bed in the morning minus me in their live is beyond my comprehension, so it is much easier for me just to assume death became them.  brian agreed and added "yes, a slow painful death."  we see eye to eye on a lot of things.

       i have this collection of comments, ifyouwill.  things said to me innocently, hurtfully, lovingly, harmlessly.  they are stored in the back of my mind.  sometimes i don't even recall the situation surrounding the comment, only the comment.  the significance of these comments range.  but it amazes me how powerful our words can be.  the people that made these comments to me, some good some bad, certainly didn't realize at the time just how momentous they would be to me.  that they would remain with me for my eternity coming back in brief flashes during my daily routine.  sometimes creating the same feeling inside me as real and fresh as the day the comment was made.    i thought about sharing the comment that initiated this post, but it's too personal.  i know i can share some pretty private details of my days here.  i love to share intimate details of myself with people, i prefer people to know all of me.  but still, some things are sacred and too close to my heart to share.  this being one of them.

       it's incredible how i can love and hate something so much, all at the same time.  the holidays are a perfect representation of this love/hate paradox for me.  i love that everybody is friendlier than usual.  i hate that it takes christmas decorations and ho ho ho's to bring this out in our society.  i love that people will let you in their lane when your blinker is on.  i hate that there is an abnormal amount traffic every hour of the damn day.  i love that you get to spend an unusual amount of time with your extended family.  i hate that there are people alone and that feel more alone at this time of the year than any other.  i love that i am reminded of how lucky i am to have the friends and family i have.  i hate that i am reminded of how single and alone i can feel.  i love finding the perfect gift for somebody.  i hate that it is rare for me to find the perfect gift and how bad i suck at perfect gift shopping.  i love holiday sweaters.  i hate holiday sweaters.

       my mom bought me a thong for the first time on tuesday.  it was hilarious.  as we walk through victoria secret, my mom keeps gravitating towards the flannel pajamas, i keep pulling the slutty lacy get-ups off the rack and holding them up saying "oh no no mom, boy's don't want to see me in flannel.  boys want to see me in this."  she asked if by boys i meant parker.  after some scent smelling and robe discussion, we make it to one of the many thong tables in v.s..  now this table displayed the more 'respectable' thongs.  as we are combing through the color and size selections, i spot another thong table across the store.  ahhhhhhh, the t-backs.  the skimpiest of skimpy panties.  as i begin to select which 4 for $28 i want, my mom keeps suggesting the more benign, traditional colors.  somehow this would make her feel better about her scandalous purchase.  i'm a big fan of panty flare, so naturally i pick the hot pinks and bright blues.    the funniest shit of the entire purchase is that my mom is going to give the thongs to me for christmas.  she is going to wrap them up and put a tag on the present that reads 'from santa'.  then i have to open the present in front of my brother and ernie, my mom's 'friend'.

       well, this post would of come in the a.m., but since i had the genius idea to take a two hour nap today at 3 pm, i am wide freakin' awake with no chance for sleep in sight.  so here goes...   first business of the day, happy birthday to the most precious, tactful, angelic, sweet, delightful friend in the whole wide world side.  jessie day have a wonderful birthday.   in other news, once again, just like clockwork i have reached my pre-menstrual phase of the month.  sorry, but if i have to live through it, so should you.  or at least you should have to hear about it.  i watched drumline, and cried.  for goodness sake, the movie is about a marching band.  i'm starting to realize that my menstrual cycle is my excuse for any bad or weird behavior i have.  if i'm in a bad mood or a cry baby, i'm pre-menstrual.  if i loose control of my eating, i'm either pre-menstrual, menstrual, or post-menstrual.  each month i will relay to you some odd behavior displayed on account of my period, which i'm sure will prove to be just as amusing to you as it is to me.   as i'm sure you've all noticed, i have a soothing new blog template thanks to the jessie day.  copywriter by day, blog stylist by night.  she is available for hire, at the bargain rate of $100/hour.  this kind of talent don't come cheap.  naturally, i got the discounted friend rate.  but seriously, thank you jessie, my dear.  i love it, and i hope it is to the blog audience's liking.   "as parker's godparents, we have to intervene when we feel you're not doing what's best for parker" in reference to me not putting up a christmas tree this year.  "christmas is for the children, amber."  i realize parker sleeps on a down comforter and has his own chair in the living room and has a strange liking for ellen degeneres, but parker is a dog, my friend.  me bringing boys in and out of his life has absolutely no impact on his well being.  nor does my lack of celebrating or decorating for holidays in my apartment.  in fact, i'm doing parker a favor.  any change in the decorating scheme of the apartment oddly freaks him out.  he wouldn't go into the living room for an entire day after i got new pillows.   p.s.  laurie, someone linked to my blog with the search words  skanky grandma .  nice.

       whether you agree with his politics or not, you've gotta admit, dubya is a horrible public speaker.  i just listened to his address to the nation, and he just sounds like such an uneducated man.  i believe he has above average intelligence, but the words he selects and the way he fumbles throughout his speech makes us look kind of silly, wouldn't you agree?  i realize he has an extremely tough, stressful job, but i'm not sure i want our men and women to be led thru a war by someone who cannot formulate a sentence.  now i'm not a very political gal (said like forrest gump's "i'm not a very smart man"), but i know what a good speech sounds like.  other than his bloopers, something tells me dubya's speeches ain't going down in history with 'i have a dream'.  great, now like the dixie chicks, my blog will be banned and cursed.  computers will be smashed in the streets by protesters chanting and wearing shirts that say ambernicole with a big x marked through it.

       My thoughts here today will be pretty random, because my mind is tired and going in a million different directions.  Yesterday was one of those productive type days in which I was able to accomplish mostly everything on my long list of errands, which is always a great feeling. After being the responsible adult we all know me to be, I stopped by my dad's company Christmas party for a little mariachi and barbecue.  My dad is so awesome, and such a generous man.  He owns a construction company in Austin.  99% of his employees are of Mexican origin, use fake social security numbers, and don't speak a lick of English (with the exception of 'heyyy, pretty gringa').  My dad has owned this company for over 20 years now, and has always went above and beyond for anyone employed under him, even having some employees that have been with him since the beginning.  For the past few years, after doing away with the tradition of giving everyone a ham for Christmas, he has been raffling off a vintage car or truck.  He makes the purchase, totally restores it, then gives it away to some lucky employee.  They love it, and I can see the respect and admiration they have for my dad by the look in their eyes.  I always have fun at these get-togethers, and love to tease them to continue working hard for the man, cause after all, it all trickles down to me.  After the party ended, one of his 15 year employees asked my dad for my hand and marriage, and then we went to play pool at The Stardust (i.e. funny hick bar where girls go to see wrangler butts and the size of a man's package without even undressing him).  I tried to contain myself, and avoid any hard liquor consumption, considering my company.  But that was asking too much of myself.  4 crown and diet cokes later, we were off to Trudy's, which is never a good idea.  Whoever said mixing crown royal and tequila is trouble has obviously hung out with me at some point.  I do have to give myself a pat on the back though, I managed to refrain from making out with anyone on Lone Star Interiors payroll.  Work is painful today, and I have to put on my fake smile (which goes well with scarves and turtlenecks) and pretend that I like people.  Damn.  As a totally random sidenote, I have an undeniable weakness for chips and salsa and the combination of queso with guacamole and pico de gallo.  Once I start, I don't know how to stop myself.  I need a 12 step program before I weigh 200 pounds.

       my friend's todd and nicole, mentioned numerous times on my blog before because of their wonderfulness (if that's a word) and the essential role they play in my life, have made it their life purpose to 1. breed children and 2. find me a mate.  so much so, that they have set me up on five, count them five, blind dates over the last three years.    the first guy, chris, had a mullet at one time in his life and bought me a ladder as his first gift to me.  so that ended.  the second guy, stan, had bad breath.  i had no choice.  the third guy, i forgot his name, also had a mullet at one time in his life and decorated his home in a southwestern theme.  it wasn't right, and i had to let him go.  the fourth guy, i think his name started with a d but i can't remember exactly, talked to some other girl on our date more than he talked to me.  i can't remember if he never called me or if i never called him back, but it ended nonetheless.  the fifth and final guy, justin, smoked and i suspect had a nice cocaine habit, so that was that.  what inspired me to blog this.  well, todd, the husband, works for dell and needs to plan a little christmas thingy for his team.  since i like gainfully employed men, it has always been a goal of todd and nicole's to match me with a member of the dell cult.  nicole, in all her attempts to involve me in the christmas bananza, has elected to hold the party in the clubroom where i work, so that i have to be in attendance.  rather than a dell christmas party, i am calling it my blind date orgy.  no, i will not be jumping out of any giant christmas stockings or anything.  but i will be sending out the amberlove vibe all night long (say 'all night long' with a slow, deep pronunciation).  we'll see if there are any takers.  i realize to the blind eye reading this it may appear that todd and nicole have been pimping me out for the last three years, but we try not to look at it that way.  just two friends doing another friend a solid.  that's all.  or, maybe i just had too much to drink.  who knows.

       we will now resume to the regular scheduled programming.  i am back to work today after my 1 week fog and nothing about it feels right.  in fact, i have managed to avoid working the first hour i've been here.  i have decided that my mind and body are best equipped for not working.  i want to either a) marry rich or b) inherit a fortune or c) win the lottery.  i know this is a common desire of females, but i'm different.  a lot of females would say 'if i won the lottery i would continue working' or 'i love my job so much it wouldn't matter how much money i inherit' or 'i would love to be wealthy so i can have children and stay at home with them'.  fuck that, not me.  don't get me wrong, i love my job.  but just as long as i'm forced to work.  as soon as i can afford not to work, i will be sitting at the pool, sipping martinis, flirting with the pool boy.  i realize this is not a good confession for a single woman seeking a handsome man to consider her as a mate, but fuck it.  deep down, it's what i want.  to any man who will accept i promise to keep my girlish figure, stay faithful (aside from flirting), cook, clean, foot massages, and bj's.  btw, i'm not seeing him anymore=i will come over if you call at 2 am.

       what a weekend of highs and lows.  bad circumstances can sure bring about the best of circumstances.    friday night was recovery time from the long day of coping and planning.    saturday i woke up well rested and rejuvenated.  which naturally means shopping.  i had reserved the cutest date this side of the mississippi for our company christmas party saturday night, which meant a new outfit was in order.  i hit the jackpot at my first stop, banana, which made me very pleasantly pleased.  and the cherry on top was that cookie** was working and was able to hook me up with the gay factor opinion and a 30% discount.    after my purchase i raced home to change and depart again to join old highschool chums for a reunion bar-b-que.  robert is visiting from l.a., which means the holley's organized a joyous get-together.  these are the types of friends that you don't see or speak to for a year, and then pick right back up where you left off, as if you were just kicking it the night before.  2 hours was definitely not long enough to bask in the happiness our togetherness brings.  but it had to suffice, because i had to head back home to swap outfits and prepare for the christmas fiesta.    we arrived at the four seasons to be greeted with only 3 drink tickets, which meant a fun night of finagling free drinks out of the bartender.  dinner was delightful and my date was really cute (oh wait, i already said that).  being so close to the bars, we had no choice but to continue our evening at ozlos.  now ozlos is the kind of place you go to be 'seen'.  people walk around in sunglasses, beers cost $4.50, and getting bumped becomes as natural a feeling as standing in an empty room.  sunday i slept in and then attended a new, recommended church.  for those of you who know me you're scratching your head thinking 'amber?' 'chruch?'.  yep, after a 5 or so year hiatus from formal religious gatherings, i decided to try  urlLink gateway community church , and i'm so glad i did.  it was a great experience, a 'come as you are' feeling, lacking the formality of most churches.  definitely recommended if you live in the austin area and are looking for a new church home.  who knows, you might even see me there, and they offer a 12:30 service, which makes me smile.  after an awesome lunch at kirby lane, home of good food and bad service (according to b), my brother and i headed back to san antonio for my grandmother's wake.  despite the circumstance that brought us together, what an amazing gathering.  i found so much comfort in being with my relatives.  these are relatives that i have not seen in 8 - 15 years, but it felt more like we met for the first time.  it was such a blessing in disguise.  now i know where i get my feistiness from, and my love for the bottle, and my frequent use of the 'f' word.  i was at home, and my gaurd was down.  tomorrow we will bury my grandma.  it will be tough.  but i will drive home with a smile and a tear.   **we have a group of gay friends who are collectively known as the 'joy boys' but individually have nicknames

       It all feels so premature.  We made the funeral arrangements today.    We selected the flower spread, red roses.  We chose the verse to be printed on the prayer cards that are to be handed out to funeral attendees, the 23rd Psalm.  We picked the casket, pecan wood.    There will be no obituary printed, however.  She insisted.  She didn't want everyone in San Antonio reading about her, "It is none of their damn business if I die."    So Grandma, no obituary.  I agree with you, it's kind of silly, and if I didn't like attention so much, I'd probably request the same for when I go.  Grandma, this is not an obituary, but more of a tribute.  A tribute to a survivor.  Las Vegas is not the only place with bad odds.  We shuffle the deck of life, and sometimes we get a lousy hand.  But unlike Vegas, we don't get the choice of folding and walking back to our hotel room.  We're forced to play our cards just as they've been dealt to us.  Not a single moment of rest.  Not one bit of slack.  Every day was a struggle.  Every year was a battle.  But a peaceful passing.  And now a restful sleep.  I love you Barbara Jean Ferris.  Thank you for the name and all it represents.

        deep thoughts   by: amber ferris   it's amazing all the unexplainable bruises caused by a night of drinking  the more people at a gas station, the slower your gas pumps  i don't find it strange that when i cuddle with parker, he wraps his arms around me, or that i call them arms  one should not find it flattering that a guy would stalk her or slip her GHB  wine was not meant to be served out of a box, ever  crawling in to a bed that's been made and has clean sheets is perhaps the best feeling ever  people order flaming dr. peppers because they like to see flames come out of people's mouths,  they taste like poop  every artist does not need to have a christmas album.  seriously.

       i have way too much time on my hands.  with the exception of having thanksgiving day and the day after off, i worked all other days so that my co-workers could take a weeks vacation (i know what you're thinking...now this girl is a team player).  so now, i am left will all my days off in a row (wednesday thru sunday).  okay, so maybe there was some selfish motive in working all those days.  anyways, back to too much time on my hands.  i am depressingly broke, so i am left to sit around my apartment with nothing to do but be left to my own thoughts...scary shit.  what i've done today....  a. watched the view.  now this is wrong in so many ways.  there is nothing good about this show.  and i've never wanted to inflict bodily harm on someone like i do when star jones opens her big fat mouth.  shut the fuck up you fat bitch.  nobody cares what you did in the court room twenty damn years ago.  and stop flirting with all the guests.  they only flirt back cause they feel sorry for your fat ass.  b. brian sent me an email to compile any old love letters i might have for a research paper his roommate is writing on love.  now i know why so many women burn old love letters.  talk about re-living some fucked up emotional shit.  i've actually had a lot of 'closure' from the relationship that produced these letters i speak of, especially considering it ended some 3 years ago.  but, now i have a strong desire to get in contact with him and see what the hell he's been up to.  so i've mailed a letter to his mom's house to say whuzz up.  super.  c. have you seen jessica simpson's new video?  i don't even know what stupid song of hers it is, but the video crams all of the 'famous' jokes from her ridiculous show in a way-to-obvious fashion.  it starts with her struggling to clean her house in a t-shirt that spells out pla-ta-ma-pus.  then she stands around eating out of a chicken of the sea can.  then she lays around in some dirty laundry.  then she struggles to hit some golf balls.  then, the worst part.  she sits there with wing sauce all over her hands and face eating buffalo wings.  throughout the video she makes her stupid pouty faces she always annoys nick with.  okay maybe your boyfriend thinks that shit is cute, but the general public, the people not fucking your slutty ass every night, finds it increasingly annoying.  d. old fashioned oatmeal cooked with vanilla soy milk with one sweet-n-low in it is very, very good.  e. put the astrology book down.  f. it's almost 4 o'clock.  i suppose it is time to take a shower.  shit, that's free.

       good morning my friends.  yes, i said morning.  i didn't get up until almost 3 pm, so this is still morning to me.  i need constant adult supervision.    my horoscope said to get out and be social.  my idea of this was apparently drinking until i was face down on the concrete sidewalk of 6th street.  furthermore, i really need to be more selective about the quality of guys i make out with in bars.  the following messages left on my cell phone last night were played on speakerphone this morning:    1st message:  amber, hey baby, what's up?  this is ryan.  it's about 11:45.  calling to see what you're up to, what ya'll are going to do.  give me a call 219-1352 area code 817.   2nd message:  hey you fucking hoe bag bitches.  fucking can't believe you didn't call us back.  fuck off bitch.  i mean, why you playing games?  you want to hook up come to my house tonight.  i mean, one night stand, what else you want?    yes, all this on a tuesday.

       my boss is interviewing for an open position.  today, when the interviewee came in, gina took the girl back to her office to start the interview.  gina left her fresh cup of coffee sitting on my desk.  i got the cup, and as timidly as possible walked it into gina's office and set it down with my head down and as if in fear said "here's your coffee just the way you like it ma'am, is there anything else i can get for you ma'am?"  she just glared at me.  man, i love to fuck with her.

        urlLink  WORLD AIDS DAY    August 2003 Amy entered a state of panic.  It dawned on her that it had been years since she had gotten an AIDS test.  Not to experience this alone, she gathered the troops to share in her trepidation.  She was sitting at my house on the computer, searching AIDS related websites, reading about symptoms and odds.  The only way to calm this panic would be to get tested - so here our adventures began...  We put Amy in charge of researching a place for us to go for a free AIDS test.  The next day she had us all an appointment and a yahoo map to our testing destination, ALLGO.  A few days later - it had arrived - the date of our appointment.  She had not payed much mind to the map previous to this day, but once we started our venture towards ALLGO, we began to question just what Amy had gotten us into.    Traveling along Mopac, Amy said to exit 1st street and travel east.  "How far east?" we ask Amy.  "East of IH35," she replies.  I suppose a lot of  east sides  have a reputation for not exactly being the best part of town, and Austin's east side is no exception.   As we travel down 1st street (which is actually re-named Ceasar Chavez Street as you enter into the realm of East Austin) we get further and further away from the civilization we have known and into a undiscovered territory that makes you want to lock your doors and only slow down for stop signs.  After passing several housing projects and pawn shops, our street was in sight.  We take a left onto Tillery Street, and begin to look for 701 Tillery Street.  We see nothing that resembles a clinic or office of any kind.  What we do find - a row of old warehouse type buildings with a piece of plywood set in the window with the number  701  spray-painted on it.  'Great' we all thought and said outloud.  We are fixing to have blood drawn at a place that has a piece of plywood in the window to identify themselves.  We sat in the car for a few moments giggling and debating whether or not this was the best idea to go through with.  We composed ourselves, put on our brave faces and with arms locked began to walk towards the front door of 701 Tillery Street.  As we enter the building, things liven up.   All the walls are painted a different bright color, and the waiting room screams 'welcome'.  However, no one was there to say 'welcome'.  There are two Hispanic women sitting in the waiting room, but merely glance us white girls over as we enter their territory, and offer no words of guidance or help.  Soon after our arrival, the two ladies exit the room to join a large group of other Hispanic women in the room adjacent to the waiting room.  We are left in our confusion to laugh and whisper our 'what the fucks'?    Finally, about 20 minutes into our wait, a female leaves the group and enters the waiting room to witness our uncomfortable presence.  She asks us what has brought us here and I step forward to explain our appointment for a 'test'.  She knew immediately what I am referring to and tells us that Robert will be right with us.  Finally, some confirmation that we have come to the right place.  The friendly lady asks us if we'd like to know more about this place we have stumbled into, and the only correct answer to this was OF COURSE.  She explains that ALLGO is the Austin Latino/Latina Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Organization.  She is explaining to us the different support groups they offer (motioning towards the Hispanic ladies gathered in the room next to us).  I'm thinking at this point 'only me'.  Furthermore, she begins getting out fliers about the Gay & Lesbian lifestyle, and reading to us a poem from one flier about giving ourselves breast exams.  Nice.  About 15 minutes later Robert, our tester comes out to rescue us and is nothing more than a ray of sunshine.  He made our already comical, tense experience so pleasant and fun, we almost forgot the seriousness of the issue which had brought us there in the first place.  Although our AIDS testing experience was unique, the point of this story was to encourage everyone who engages/or has engaged in any level of risky behavior to please, please get tested.  Every city offers free testing, and it is certainly worth your time.  After all, the spread of AIDS is primarily due to ignorance and having no knowledge of your status.   urlLink AIDS SERVICES OF AUSTIN   urlLink NATIONAL HIV TESTING RESOURCES   urlLink ALLGO

       well, it's superbowl eve.  i'm not a jehovah's witness or anything, but i could give a fuck.  actually, here's what superbowl means to me: an excuse to drink, an excuse to eat buffalo wings, and an excuse to sit in a crowded room with cute boys.   p.s.  i'm the drunk girl in the bar  p.s.s.  it's not good when you eat twice as much as your date  p.s.s.s.  or drink twice as much for that matter  p.s.s.s.s.  however, this is standard behavior for some

       my email to my friend:  i was watching ellen degeneres the other day, and apparently, she was overweight at one time in her life.  she mentioned that once you are, no matter how great of shape you get into, you still have somewhat of that overweight mentality.  she still obsesses about it and has some of those same insecurities.  i certainly obsess about it.  seriously, i think about it almost every half hour, if not more.  and i'm thinking about 'it' for like 9 years now (i started gaining weight my freshmen year in highschool).   anytime i pass by a mirror, go to the restroom, feel hungry, feel full, walk up stairs with someone walking behind me, walk thru our fitness center, walk by a pool...you get the point.  i fucking hate it.  as weird as this might sound, i kind of feel lucky sometimes that i had to experience that.  being fat at such a fragile time in my life.  so many girls are fortunate to be skinny thru this age.  not because they eat right or exercise, but because age and metabolism hasn't caught up to them.  these are the girls that get older, married, and fat.  then their husbands fuck around on them.  okay, maybe that's a little extreme.  but, seriously, i am so concious of it, and have had to be at such a young age.  i know now i will always have to work at it, i know now how to control it, and i now have been there and have SUCH a strong desire to never go back.  america has fucked our mentality.

       If you haven't taken the time yet, you should.  Read Julia's blog.  She is brilliant, and has graced us with her well thought out, intelligent gift of writing.  Of course, I particularly liked the following post copied and pasted here from her blog.  Please read and visit.  You won't be disappointed.  -amber    Dude, I was reading something and found the following.   You look upon sex as an almost religious opportunity for self-dissolution and union with the universal whole. For you sex contains the seeds of enlightenment through immolation of the ego in the fires of physical passion.   It's about something else but I realized that it's somewhat of a description of tantric sex (though way too intellectualized, inadequate and confining). I'm always trying to describe this experience to people but can't seem to find the words. Tantric sex is actually an energy experience, not about the crazy positions. You won't know it until you have it and then you'll know what I'm talking about...Something happens. It's like you've disappeared and are part of the universe, yet you and your partner ARE the universe. It's one of the most amazing experiences ever. But both people have to be absolutely "connected" for that door to open (completely emotionally, psychically naked...there's more but I don't know how to formulate it into words..this is an experience I have yet to find adequate words for). It's not just emotional intimacy. It goes beyond that. You experience the connection and the beauty not only as yourself, but as your partner and as everything that exists. Suddenly, there are no boundaries ANYWHERE. You are everything and everything is you. You're not even bound by your body anymore. It's the ultimate in sexual experience but it's almost a spiritual awakening through a sexual connection. And once you've had it, something in you opens up and you change.   That experience changed the way I looked at life. And I know that people who have also experienced it regard it as almost a religious experience that changes them as well. It doesn't mean that other forms of physical intimacy aren't as good...being physical with someone comes in different flavors (tones, situations, emotional approaches, acts, whatever) and to be able to experience different ones at different times is what makes the physical side of life fun and worth having. And don't think of this experience as something that will keep you together with another person forever, for better or for worse. It's just an experience. But if you can find someone with whom you have a soul connection, and manage to each put down all of your walls and take the leap of true intimacy and connectedness for just a small window of time, you will have the chance to experience something that goes beyond words and the confines of this world.  posted by Julia 12:29 PM

       today was a MUCH.BETTER.DAY.  just got home from the gym, and the only thing that got me to 10 on my last set of reps was getting to do them while looking at the guy's ass who was lifting in front of me.  completely aside from that dude's ass, for those who don't know, if you don't call me when you say you're going to call me, you won't get a call back when you do get around to calling.  you don't make the cut.  you're vetoed.  that's the unspoken words of early stage dating, or at least dating amber.  in the age of cell phones the 'i couldn't call' pill is just too big for me to swallow.  enough about me, let's talk more about me.  i'm fixing to re-enter into the glorious world of roommates.  i don't say that sarcastically at all...i'm really looking forward to it.  i think living with roommates can be a good thing.  1. typically (and hopefully) it's the only age in our lives we get to do it 2. with the right person it can be fun, a lot of fun 3. it is challenging and character building  i've been living on my own (minus roommates or boyfriends) for 2 or so years now.  so it will definitely be an adjustment.  but that's what i do best, adjust.  so i know i'll be just fine.  my new roommate, sylvia, came over last night so we could tour the floor plan, pick rooms, lay out furniture, have mock drinking contests, what have you.  she asked me what my pet peeves and idiosyncrasies were.  i'm a fairly kick back roommate, and nothing came to mind.  okay sylvia, i lied.  here goes:  1. i obsessively use my paper shredder 2. i use my blender every morning 3. there is only one way to load the dishwasher...my way 4. i'm a creature of habit, big time 5. i obsessively set the intrusion alarm 6. i burn incense constantly 7. i have to do a little booty-shakin' dance before going out in whatever outfit is chosen, preferably to r. kelly 8. after the ice maker bucket fills up, i turn the lever to stop, then after using every single cube of ice i let it make a whole new fresh batch of ice - then repeat  now parker's: 1. cleaning products make him sneeze 2. he likes to weave in and out of the vertical blinds, a lot 3. he has to have a toy in his mouth when you get home or someone new arrives.  if he can't find one of his toys any pair of panties, a pillow, or a shoe will do 4. don't leave your tampons or maxi pads in the trash can 5. any food left on the edge of the counter unattended is fair game 6. staring is not begging, we've discussed this

       today was kind of a disappointing day.  one of those days where i felt aggravated the whole day thru.  nothing sat right with me.  it actually started as a decent day, and slowly digressed.  it's strange, normally i can anticipate these days.  call it intuition or insight or just a gut feeling, but i do.  i was completely blindsided by this day.  here's the problem.  i am really bad at taking criticism.  like, really bad.  i think criticism is healthy, necessary, and productive.  it's just hard for me to stomach.  i have to let it sink in, process it, and try to understand it.  this takes me a while, sometimes months.  i really take it to heart.  like i said before, i am sensitive like that.  on a lighter note, i'm sitting here staring at the 'it's only kinky the first time' sticker on my mirror and was reminded of a message left on our call notes at work today, by a black man with a deep voice:  "hey rachel, it's lorenzo.  i'm calling to tell you that you left some lingerie in my truck and i'm just trying to return it to you.  please give me a call."

       today might be one of the best days of my life thus far.  it started as an ordinary morning.  snooze on the alarm clock 6 or 7 times, parker's whine serves as my final wake up call, dog food and protein shakes are served, shower, blow drying, and then, like seeing the gates to heaven for the first time, a lean cuisine commercial.  and not just any lean cuisine commercial.  a lean cuisine commercial advertising their new low-carb microwave meal.  YES, they are finally on the bandwagon, and i couldn't be happier.  almost everytime i visit the h.e.b. (the scabs have a great song on this btw) i stroll down the frozen food isles, paying close attention to the frozen goodness for us weight conscious folks, hoping and praying that they have finally created a meal minus the rice or pasta.  this is a great step for man kind.  we have a low carb lean cuisine and soon we'll be sending man to mars for the first time.  2004 is going to be a great year, i can tell already.   one other note this morning.  i happen to think job-related strikes and picketing are typically kind of silly.  this morning they announced on the news that our city bus system, home to the lowest denomination of austinites, was temporarily going to be effected as a result of the employees going on strike for better wages and better conditions.  wtf?  give me a fucking break.  better conditions?  what do they want xm radio and flame seat covers?  this is like a garbage man or plumber asking for better conditions.  look, you're going to deal with shit and used tampons, so get the fuck over it or get another job.  don't get me wrong, i appreciate these people, i rely on these people, i need these people, but come on.  you've taken this career path.  you've accepted a job at that hourly wage.  you forwent college and med school.  so, here you sit, picking up and dropping off all day every day.  the conditions ain't gonna get any better.  have you considered a job with the state?  i hear they have GREAT conditions.  i'm usually not much of a ranter.  all apologies.  get 'er done.

       thank goodness for the internet.    i forgot to keep my promise to you and capture on film (or digital camera memory card) the horrendous gifts from the dad's girlfriend before returning them this afternoon (which, by the way, you can only get in store credit with a gift receipt...oh well, i'm sure eventually talbots is bound to have something i want).  first, i went to foley's to return  urlLink the shoes .  i was so embarrassed to be in possession of the shoes in the first place, i approached the cashier with "so, apparently, my dad's girlfriend thinks i'm a hooker."  she just laughed, and so did the old lady next to me purchasing her easy spirits.  then, on to teacher's heaven, talbots, to return  urlLink the dress .  she smokes crack.  a lot of it i suspect.

       recently, i have been bombarded with that personality type.  you know the type.  that over-zealous sleazy type.  the type of guy that is always 'on', has an extra cheeziness and insincerity factor to his tone of voice, poor eye contact, nervous hand movements, repeats himself, and uses catchphrases.  they call them salesmen.  this personality type bugs me and completely turns me off.  i like to think of myself as a pretty assertive girl who can understand or adapt to almost any personality type.  but this one, i don't know, it just rubs me the wrong way.  it makes me defensive, intimidated, uncomfortable, and irritated.  perhaps that is because other personality types - despite how much they might conflict with mine - are real.  the salesman type is just so manufactured and fake.  and typically, it doesn't stop in their professional life, but carries into their personal lives.  it becomes the way they deal with all people, on and off the clock.  i suppose i'm a salesperson of sorts in my line of work.  especially in the dog eat dog world of multi-family housing - due to the surplus and economy in austin, texas.  but, somehow, my approach is much different with people.  i treat people with respect, i relate to them, i help them relax, i make them laugh, and i show them the product.  they either take it or they don't.  but there will be no pressure or annoying sales tactic from me.  because i firmly believe in treating others how i want to be treated.  in fact, i get the compliment all the time that i'm a great salesperson in the most un-salesperson type way.  to all the salesmen out there, any nitwit with half a brain can see right through you.  we know the game.  not only am i not going to participate in it, i'm going to call you out on it.  fuckers.

       each and every time i leave my house, i tell parker how precious he is and how much i love him, and then he gets a treat (a practice i know barry and jessie can understand and appreciate, even though there is no cutting board involved in my routine).  honestly, parker disregards my praises and focuses his full attention on his treat jar, whilst drooling (seriously, and not just a little drool either).    tonight, nicole and i are leaving my apartment, and i proceed to do the usual routine.  nicole remarks that she knows why parker is getting so chubby (something i constantly complain about).  "parker is getting fat cause you're always leaving."  perhaps it's just a guilt treat?

       every day is a lesson.  today's lesson: that everyday is a lesson. ------ when i was a small girl, while most of my friends aspired to be teachers or doctors or lawyers, i wanted to be a court reporter.  i don't know when or why i decided this, but i did.  obviously, at some point, i changed my mind, and my life headed the direction it was intended to.  and here i sit, in the amusing world of property management. ------ i just had a resident call and ask me to have maintenance come to turn down her heater, as it is too hot for her kids in the apartment.  yesterday, a resident called me to report that there was a constant odor in his apartment coming from the apartment below him.  the odor: majiuana.  and now his mom thinks he is 'on the stuff'.  i go to the apartment to confirm the odor.  it was weed alright.  only problem is, it was not a 'burning' smell but a 'growing' smell.  i'm such a fan of the stuff, it was really hard for me to call our courtesy officer to tell him he would have to check this out.  my apologies to my fellow tokers.  btw, thank goodness m-w puts the slang definition of toke: a puff on a marijuana cigarette or pipe. ------ one thing that i don't typically talk a whole lot about is my childhood.  this is for many reasons.  primarily, it was not that great.  i think due to that, i don't have a lot of childhood memories to talk about.  and the ones i do have, well, they are not that great.  in hindsight, and thru maturity (a word i use very loosely when using it to describe myself) i am so thankful for it.   ------ i have the best boss in the world.  i don't like to call her boss.  she is more of a chief.  she understands me, believes in me, encourages me, listens to me, and guides me.  i can tell her anything, ANYTHING.  i can trust her with my private details, and i can be certain that i'm going to receive the best advice from her.  i'm not the only one.  every person in this office, under her wing, gets the same treatment from her.  she has this amazing ability, the ability to not have 'favorites'.  actually, let's face it, we all know that i'm her favorite, but if you observed our office for a day, you would never realize it.  she also has this amazing ability to provide fairness and justice throughout our office.  finally, she has this one quality.  a quality she shares with very few people.  the ability to work with anyone.  no matter how bad you suck, she will figure out what your about, and enhance that quality, work with it, focus on it.  she focuses on the positive, ALWAYS.  i'm in aw at her ability to do that. ------ i am so hot and cold about people.  black or white.  there is no middle ground.  once i decide, i generally have decided for good.  that's just the wayz itz gonna be.   ------ some people just don't get it.  i'd like to think i am completely aware of my qualities that are undesirable to others.  and i either a) am focusing on changing them or b) like that quality about myself, because it's just 'me', and have no desire to change it.  it always amazes me the people that obviously don't get it.  they have no clue.  and probably never will.  ------ have you ever felt like you have boogers, but when you go to check it out, there are no boogers to be found? ------ my thoughts are all over the place this morning.  and i could not formulate them into a logical sequence, so i wrote about them as they came to me.  sorry for the irrational post.

       i am up at this ungodly hour, despite the fact that i have to work at 9 am.  ugh!  something strange is in the air.  i'm in a funk.  i don't feel exactly right about my mood.  usually, i'm pretty good at putting my finger on why i feel the way i feel.  perhaps it's that i started my fucking period two weeks early, perhaps i ate too much cheese and reeses peanut butter cups today.  whatever it is, i take solace in knowing it will pass and soon enough my stomach won't feel like it is contracted and out of position.  as quickly as this feeling has come, it will pass.

       i love the fucking shit out of my horoscope today.  who doesn't want this to be their horoscope?  Dear AMBER, Here is your horoscope for Tuesday, January 13:  Strength and beauty are out of control. Your effect is devastating, but maybe you were going for some lesser form of damage. Be careful what you wear and what you say. Some people just aren't ready for you.

       have you ever found yourself in a situation where you didn't want to win, but you didn't want to lose either?  it's called having the upperhand, i think.  more recently, i've realized how important having the upperhand in a situation is to me.  not that we don't all like having the upperhand, but i'm obsessed with it. i crave it.  when i no longer want to be a part of a relationship, a friendship, or a situation in general, i can walk away with ease only if i feel like i have the upperhand.  if i feel it's mutual or one-sided in the other's favor, i find it harder to end.  i suppose i have a severe fear of rejection.  i'm much more thin-skinned than i project.  people perceive me as this tough broad.  i think my excessive use of the word fuck gives people the wrong image.  the truth of the matter is, i'm extremely sensitive.  and extremely good at dealing with my feelings internally.

       this will be completely random.  but i feel like typing, and writing.  so here goes.  my weekend was good.   really good.  i'm sure, considering saturday's post, this might sound surprising.  but shit, life is great.  and overall, i'm in a good state of mind right now.  so, friday night was the whole 'peace out'  -  'check ya later'  -   'it's been good knowing you'  -  thing.  somehow, i grieved over it for a total of like 10 hours, 6 of which i slept through.  i wore a bright red shirt to work the next day.  so, i think that means i'm over it.  totally.  fuck the 5 or however many stages of grieving.  i had one stage.  it was margaritas.  and a boy from mexico city named david, pronounced da-veed.  he is a beautiful specimen.  with eyes that make you melt, hair that makes you wet, and teeth that gives you goose bumps.  seriously.  here's how it went down....  i have this thing i do.  this game i like to play, when i'm in a certain mood.  in social situations, if i feel any level of physical attraction towards an individual, i tag him.  he has no choice.  we will hook up.  it's the taurus in me.  i'm a vulture like that.  very straight forward, very aggressive.  my most recent victim, da-veed.  he was our waiter.  and i was already feeling the benefits of my medicine, tequila.  he soon was feeling the benefits of my medicine, too.  it was no holds barred.  after a meal of intense flirting and complimenting, my pseudo-niece left da-veed my phone number.  it was in green crayola.  with a picture of a stick person or some shit.  my pseudo-niece, by the way, was beside herself last night when i told her da-veed called me and that we ended up hanging out.  she's 10.  and already a successful match-maker.    so we met up at a pool hall.  i proceeded to dazzle him with my impressive ability to consume all varieties of alcohol in mass quantities.  nothing woos a man like a girl that can hold her liquor (sarcasm intended here, lots of it).   there was lots of staring, and sweet touches.  finally, at the conclusion of the night, there was kissing, then there was the admittance that he had a girlfriend.  which wrapped up the whole kissing thing, because i am NOT that kind of girl.  and he is THAT kind of guy.  piece of shit.    every sunday, my wonderful nicole has family night.  her sisters and their significant others come over.  them, the three red-headed kiddos, the hubby and me gather round the table for some dinner.  actually, during sex and the city season, we gather round the television for some fabulous viewing.  last night, in addition to the chicken and rice and samantha's diagnosis of breast cancer, i consumed two bottles of wine.  in williamson county.  which happens to be the worst county in the whole wide world to drink and drive thru.  i got pulled over.  i wasn't speeding, swerving, nothing.  so, i'm pissed, and tipsy enough to feel really calm and relaxed thru the whole situation.  he says he clocked me at 58 in a 40.  i proceed to argue with him.  he takes my license back to his car, where he spends 10 or so minutes doing whatever the fuck they do when they go back to their car.  then, he walks back over to me, hands me my license, and tells me to be on my way.  no ticket, no warning, nothing.  for those of you who know me, you know what a lucky bitch i am.  i don't know how i end up in situations like this, or how i get out of them.  but shit.  i hope my luck never runs out.  with my lifestyle, i need it.  i have to conclude now.  i'm getting a haircut...FINALLY.  i'm starting to look a little w.t. with my split ends and dried up nap.  my commitment to growing my hair long is working out wonderfully.  usually i cave about 4 months into the quest.  but not this time.  about a year into it, and still just as committed as day 1.  my hair gal will be so proud.      i'm resilient.  i've got the 'get over it' technique mastered.

       i know the most wonderful human being.    ever.  aside from the fact that she is the most loyal, present friend.   she is incredible.    she is the exception.  she has radiating beauty, inside and out.    beauty that cannot be described in words.    verbiage does no justice.  i can make an attempt.  but i cannot project a realistic picture.    her beauty is that intense.  it is that incredible.  i want her to write a book.    i think it is only fair that she shares her amazing grace with the rest of the world to learn from.    to understand.    to experience.  she developed in a childhood that destroys souls...character...life.    in the midst of it, she objected to it.    she rejected it.    she defied everything it stood for.  she met a comparable soul.  his heart matched hers.  growth occurred that would not of otherwise.  verity ensued.  from this, blessings were created.  monstrosities of nature.  children are shy because of unfamiliarity.  sheltered lifestyles.  lack of love.  the unknown all too common.  her children are a mere projection, a slice of the pie, a piece of the puzzle, of the love in her larger than life heart.  it's like nothing you've seen before.    i wish you could all experience it.    but i don't want to share her.    she's all mine.  all mine.    all that is her.  it is dream-like to watch.  her confidence in her decisions, her family, her friends, her self.  i can't understand or comprehend.    but i embrace.  i realize the answer to my prayers.  i see the blessing stowed.

       so, at 5:30 am, that was all i could muster up.  but i would like to say more on the subject, for whatever reason.  another series in the thriller i call life came to a conclusion last night, and the new york times has given it four stars and an outstanding review.  i couldn't agree more.  i feel a mixture of sadness and sweet relief.    it was one of those relationships where you know the ultimate outcome, almost from the day it began, but enjoy the game and the player so much, you can't help but suit up and play the mother fucking game.  of course, when things like this occur, comfort is found in friends, and sometimes people you hardly know.  i've had the fortune of having all of the above come to my aid.  geesh, i'm so lucky and blessed.  some advice was comical, some advice was supportive, some was sweet, empathetic and comforting.  most of it is worth sharing with you.  scotty (see post dated october 9th, 2003) encouraged me to come along with him and join the bachelor religion, of which he is a dedicated follower.  he explains that when you choose not to participate in the cruel, cruel world of dating you don't run the risk of this type of pain.  he then compared dating to the practice of looking for employment or test driving cars, less all the paperwork.  the dents and dings don't matter.  the bosses bad breath.  the busted speaker.  the dress code.  none of it matters.  because you're not obligated.  there is always another help wanted ad in the classifieds and there is always another dealership just up the road.  okay, maybe he didn't say all that.  he's not that eloquent with words.  i might of enhanced his advice a little, with what i think he intended to say.  nicole couldn't be more happy, and is certain that this is for the best.  i'm in total agreement with her opinion, and know that the release from this unfunctinal (not disfunctional) whatever you want to call it, allows me to stop wondering, waiting, and questioning.  she says that we (remember, she lives vicariously thru me, so refers to the goings on in my life as 'our' drama) can now focus on something more realistic and more real.  we agreed that although i expressed no obligation to this relationship and was always open to new prospects, sometimes we aren't presented with new options until we close the door and walk away completely.  and it didn't help the matter that he would call my phone at odd hours in the middle of the night when i was in the presence of new potential candidates.    josh, a resident and friend of mine, said "some people are so trailer."  this was said after i explained how juvenile his behavior was and how he really 'showed his age' last night.  lauri, after seeing my post about dancing close to the fire, emailed me to make certain i wasn't indeed dancing near fires.  after assuring her that there were no physical injuries sustained, she responded with a thoughtful, sweet email.  the conclusion of her email (which, by the way, completely conflicts with all the practices and beliefs of scotty's bachelor religion) was full of truth.  "amber, no matter what the age or profession is, they're all fucked up.  i swear.  it's hit and miss, trial and error.  the point is, dancing too close to the fire is the only way you'll find one that's, on the off chance, NOT fucked up."  i would also like to mention, however odd this might sound, the strength and pride i feel when relationships come to a close.  emotions are exercised that don't get a lot of use otherwise, i get to know more about myself, i grow, i feel, and i get answers.  i have not cried yet, which is out of character for me, and perhaps i won't cry.  i don't know if this is due to always having known the inevitable or great hope for my future or a combination of both.  but i feel like a small weight has been lifted.  i feel okay.  i feel right.  i think i'll miss his cool fucking dog more.  the dog knows football plays and how to open and close doors.  besides, he is a drummer and smokes too much pot.

       i find great joy in receiving and using advertisement pens.  currently i am using one that advertises nasonex, given to us in bulk by a resident that is a pharmaceutical rep.  i'm placing an order for my own promotional pens to hand out in the austin social scene.  the text reads:                                                       amber ferris                                       bonded  -  licensed  -  insured   look what happens to me when nobody is looking for an apartment and no motherfucking residents are bitching.  i realize this is a stretch of the imagination (or perhaps no stretch at all), but damn i'm bored.  i'm fixing to start brainstorming slogans for post-it notes and koozies.

       i expressed my envy of creative people.  if there's one thing i wish i was, it's creative.  she responded, "you're creative with people.  there are different types of creativity.  you have the ability to talk to anyone and make strangers comfortable."  she might not of realized the impact it had at the time.  but it has completely changed my perspective on creativity.  and opened my eyes to a gift.  i'm thankful.

       i know people usually do this when they first start their blog,  but not me.  so fuck you.  i'm doing it right now.  you can't stop me.  the wonder that is amber:  1. one time i got pulled over for doing 110, and talked my way out of it. 2. my dad called my mom "chubb" my entire childhood, and we never realized how rude or out of line it was.  even more so, my mom is pretty thin. 3. my brother had an 'all boys club' when we were children.  he wouldn't let me and my girlfriend join.  so we put cow poop all over the 'all boys club' fort. 4. i only stole once in my life.  it was a couple of pairs of panties from contempo casual.  we went in the dressing room, and layered them on. 5. i went to south padre island 4 spring breaks in a row.  here i bonged a whole lotta beer. 6. my favorite all time foods are chips and salsa and breakfast tacos. 7. i am at least 10 minutes late to work everyday. 8. i love wearing high heels.  i almost never wear anything else.  even when i have to walk long distances. 9. i invited both guys i was dating to my 24th birthday party.  they both showed up.  it was awkward. 10. i obsess about my weight. 11. i sometimes fantasize about being married to conan o'brien. 12. i still watch re-runs of 90210. 13. i believe in karma.  and make decisions with this in mind. 14. i believe in astrology.  i sometimes let it affect my perception of people.  especially if they are a male gemini. 15. when i was 13, i drove my brother's car into the house.  seriously, i hit the dryer in the laundry room. 16. i had to stop getting my last dog high, because she always peed on herself. 17. my brothers gotten fired from 2 jobs for getting caught with a six pack on the job.  i'm talking about beer. 18. i lived in a barn for two years. 19. my friends and i used to steal a lot of pot from my step mom in high school.  i suppose this goes against #4.  okay, #4 only refers to stores, not step-parents. 20. one time we went thru a bank drive thru high, and accidentally took the little money holder thing. 21.  i called the police on our own party when we lived in the 'den of sin'.  we were ALL underage drinkers.  yeah, i was really drunk. 22. i made pot brownies as my contribution to my dad's 2003 new year's party. 23. my step mom gave one to my step grandma.  she went to the hospital. 24. i didn't have my first boyfriend until i was 18. 25. as a senior in highshcool, me and some fellow seniors toilet papered a junior's house.  we got caught by the said junior, and this led to a 4 hour high speed chase all over austin, in my mom's suburban.  it was so juvenile, but hella fun.   the list shall continue at a later date.  feel free to add to the list as you see appropriate.  okay, appropriate is not the theme of the list.  so add whatever the fuck you want to add.

       a lot of firsts happened last night.  i pick sarah up, and something along these lines comes out of her mouth: "i've been hungry since like 4 o'clock.  so i had beer.  i'm an alcoholic, amber.  i drink too much.  i just don't tell anybody."  i've known sarah for almost 10 years.  for the first time ever, sarah carried a purse and wore mascara.  she did a demonstration of how it is the perfect size, adequately fitting her cell phone and wallet and then batted her eyes at me, which is what you do when you wear mascara.  for the first time ever, sarah and i joked about our attraction to certain women, and the possibility that all women might be some level of bisexual.  for the first time ever, i saw sarah put down two $ .75  upgrade mexican martinis at trudy's (seriously, she didn't pick a tequila, just the $ .75 upgrade).  for the first time ever, i saw sarah continue drinking after beverages that would normally put her on her ass.  for the first time ever, i bummed a cigarette for sarah, then proceeded to watch her smoke like a motherfucking chimney.  and most importantly and surprisingly, for the first time ever, i closed down a bar with sarah last night.    a few other firsts happened last night, but this is not the time or place.  b, take a jacket when you go.  cause hell just froze over.

       so, i can be a bit vulgar at times, totally inappropriate a good deal of the time, and just outright raunchy most of the time.  my recent visit to dallas was no exception to this behavior.  so, in the company of my equally vulgar, inappropriate, raunchy friends terri and brian, this behavior is perhaps, um, let's say exemplified.  just to prepare you for the pictures you're about to view, new year's day meant we started drinking at 3 pm, naturally.  well, around rolls midnight, and we're drinking grey goose and squirt (terri's recommendation.  a premium liquor and a white trash mixer.  nice.)    picture #1 the b and me in my mexican waiter shirt   picture #2 me exploring what it feels like for parker in his kennel, or play-pen according to terri   picture #3 sometimes, whenever i clean out my hair brush, i like to play this little game   urlLink take a peek   feel free to make picture #3 the background on your computer, i know it is now mine.  it's my crotch, i'll do with it what i will.

       Do you think that when parents take their kids to day care, or other kid-related gathering points, they recognize their kids as being the cutest or ugliest kid in the class?  Do you think they have a realistic picture of their kid's appearance in comparison to other kids?  Or is parental love so blinding that you really see your kid as beautiful, no matter how jacked the teeth are or awkward their nose is or gigantic their ears are.    I just wonder, because yesterday I took Parker swimming at Bull Creek, and all I kept thinking is how he was the cutest, most precious dog there (and believe me there were more dogs there than number of children that would be legally allowed in a standard sized classroom).  He's just so damn cute.  I've had him for three years now, and I still look at him every single day and can't help but hug and kiss him, because I can't stand how cute he is.  I love his demeanor in these chaotic situations.  First off, although his focus is on smelling every square foot of the park and diving into any body of water we come across, he only explores freely if I am within eye site of him.  Also, he is not competitive, by nature.  So while the other dogs squabble and fight for possession of tennis balls, Parker will come and sit next to me and observe until the dust settles, before joining in to the poopy fun again.  Alright, I'll stop.  I realize this might be annoying.  I'm like the person at your office with picture after picture of their kid.  But I promise I won't ask you to buy wrapping paper or over-priced candy in an ugly tin out of some stupid fucking catalog to raise money to send Parker to Disney World for a band competition.

       i'm just feeling a little beat down by the game right now, that's all.  boy meets girl, dating, hook ups, attraction, flirting, one night stands.  all of it.  there is no middle ground in the rules of love.  there are highs, there are lows, but no fucking middle ground.  relatively, i've had it somewhat easy in my dating career.  i've seen some doozies.  i'm currently witnessing some doozies.  and if i wanted to look at it that way, i guess i've had it somewhat easy.  however right now, it doesn't feel easy.  it feels frustrating, lonely, unfair, frightening, lopsided, confusing, and heavy.

       I realize it is a tad immature to giggle out loud in a meeting when your regional manager uses words like "stiff" and "handle well at the back end".  But my goodness, even he has to see the humor in that.  Ah well, they're used to my lack of tact by now.  And yes Jessie, this is the same manager that used the words "stand erect" at least six times in our last meeting.

       I meet with Trang to get my body fat tested, and I make a new gym buddy.  Sylvia meets with Trang to get her body fat tested, and she turns into Nazi workout partner.   Quotes from Sylvia though out last night's workout:  "We are going to start increasing the weight every workout."  "We should be sore every workout, this is bullshit."  "This is just our warm-up weight."  (me doing 120 bicep curls) "Are you sweating Amber?  YES! YES, you're sweating."  "I know how much you hate dips Amber, but tonight we are doing dips."  Anytime I complained about something hurting or being too hard, Sylvia bends her arm at her elbow, palm up, hand in a fist, and pulls arm in a backward motion, and shouts "YES!"  (treadmill set at 7.2) "It's really tough to run so hard when I'm on my period."  (we've been at the gym for two hours) "I could run further, but I really have to go."  "Just wait until we do legs tomorrow.  I'm gonna kick your ass."   I got her back by repeatedly calling her a "whore" and telling her "I hate you".

This is what i've come up with thus far.  I'd like to know what ya'll think:   Dear Bill Ferris,  This letter is in response to your generous donation.  Not only have you blessed us with your beautiful, talented, intelligent, hilarious daughter, you have now given us the gift of modern technology.  You've really outdone yourself this time, Mr. Ferris.  We know if you are half as humble as your daughter, you will accept this letter without letting it go to your head and with sincere appreciation.  Mr. Ferris, you are an amazing man, and now we see where your daughter gets her amazing spirit.  You make the world a better place to be.  In particular, you've made (apartment complex name here) business center a better place to be.  With Gratitude,    The (apartment complex name here) staff

       Last night, my mom introduced me to the new tenant living in her barn.  We hit it off instantly.  It's one of those relationships where you know from the beginning that it is going to be something special.  We turned out the lights, lit candles, ate cheese and crackers and drank red wine.  The slumber party intended for my mom's house ended up moving to his.  Yes my friends, I slept with my mom's new tenant...on the first night.  He and I both like boys, so there was no hanky panky.  The only sweet lovin' going on in his bed was with thin mints.  He brought to bed with us EVERY flavor of girl scout cookies, and said "Repeat after me.  Tonight, fuck my diet."  So I did.  And I also said fuck my rule of not sleeping with anyone the first night.  And, in attempt to further confuse Parker, he also joined us in bed.  Who knows, I might of met my gay soulmate.

       I'm sure this next comment will be frowned on by Lauri, due to her poopphobia.  But, I was reminded this morning of the poop time trials we used to have in the 'den of sin'.  Brian would start timing and yell out our times from the living room.  I held, and still do, the title for being the fasted pooper.  I'm good like that.  I know what your thinking, this girl has it all.  So, this weekend was yet another piece of evidence of all the jack asses out there looking for nothing more than a piece of ass.  I just don't get these dudes.  What a shallow, meaningless life to live.  To each their own, just leave me the fuck alone.  It was fun, and anything but restful.  But I've forgotten what restful weekends feel like.    I think Parker and I are going to have a slumber party at my moms tonight.  She misses her baby and grandson.  How can I say no to that?  Have a nice week kiddos.

       who gets the suck ass friend of 2004 award, you ask?  drum roll please......  and the winner is, amber nicole ferris of austin, texas.  why, you ask?   well, she forgot sarah's birthday on the 15th.  the same day sarah's birthday has been since she has known sarah the past seven years.  what is she going to do to redeem herself, you ask?  she is going to buy sarah the 25 cent upgrade margarita at trudy's.

       warning: the words nipple, clitoris, deep throat and hand job are going to be used in this post.  so i thought the sex toy party i went to with twenty or so 40+ year old black women was fun.  tonight's sex toy party was better.  or at least more hands on.  hand job demonstrations were done, more than once.  we had a deep throat contest with a banana, for prizes.  i came in a very close 2nd place, loosing by less than a centimeter.  we had to put gel on our nipples that made them hard and tingly.  then, i volunteered eagerly when she asked for 2 volunteers.  i didn't know what i was volunteering for at the time.  she put some cream on a stick and wispered, "go to the bathroom and rub this on your clitoris".  i just volunteered to put 'nympho niagra arousal balm' on my clitoris.  nice.  i worked out at the gym with pheromone perfume and sparkle dust on.

       are walnuts good for dogs?  i mean, i know they are good for people, but are they good for dogs?  the reason i ask is because i came home for lunch today, and parker had pulled an entire bag of them off the counter.  he ate every last one of them, including the plastic bag they were stored in.

       Last verse, same as the first.  There has been an undeniable country theme in my life this February.  It began with our trip to San Antonio to watch Pat Green do his thing.  It continued thru this weekend, with no end in sight.  Saturday, after a little recovery time from the margarita hangover and a quick visit to Golds Gym, Amy had organized an anti V-day girly luncheon, filled with sushi and a lot of talk about boys, or the lack there of in our lives.  Carey met up with us after lunch for some coffee talk and shopping on Congress (a must do if you make 6 figures a year).  I forgot how much I enjoy the company of these two girls.  Amy knows me backwards and forwards, and we go thru a lot of the same life experience simultaneously, which makes for nice conversation and relating.  Carey spends a good portion of our time together on her cell phone.  But she is so fucking precious and hilarious that her frequent disappearances to take a phone call are totally pardoned, because the time with her full attention is totally fantastic.  I was happy to be the recipient of some V-day love (in the form of emails and small tokens).  Some was from the usual suspects, some was completely unexpected and a delightful surprise.  All was needed and appreciated.  Despite my lack of love for the country music scene, this weekend proved to be filled with more wrangler butts and HUGE belt buckles.  After little convincing, I agreed to attend a Kevin Fowler concert on Saturday night.  Mainly because of the company and the fun we have together, despite the atmosphere.  The venue: Midnight Rodeo.  We had the best time, and continued to increase our social network.  Befriending Kevin Fowler's photographer and multiple other fellow honky tonkers.  We decided to fulfill our 3 am munchies, and visit IHOP.  Never count your eggs before they hatch, and never think you are soon going to be drifting into dreamland before you hit the bed.  Soon after arriving at the IHOP, in walks the road crew for Clay Walker (a honky tonker of sorts, but much more nationally know than Kevin Fowler).  After several omelets and all-you-can-eat-pancakes, the flirting between tables was in full force.  We accepted an invitation to hang out on their tour bus.  After shooting the shit with these interesting characters, we were flooded with Clay Walker mementos, including t-shirts and signed posters (upon leaving, I set my souvenirs down and asked if they would be offended if I left mine, considering I was not a Clay Walker fan of any degree).  Sunday and Monday was dedicated to errand running, working out, and the introduction of future roommates, Parker and Fatso.  I was so pleased and proud of my Parker.  He was suprisingly welcoming and friendly with his new best friend, and even allowed Fatso to drink out of his water bowl without teeth-showing or injury.  We even got to kick off the swimming season early, and took the dogs to Bull Creek.  Thanks to the much-needed recent rain, water levels are on the rise and were suitable for stick fetching and rock diving (Fatso dives under the water for seconds at a time to bring his owner rock treasures).    It appears the country theme will continue through March, as Clay Walker's crew have offered us a complimentary invitation to join them at Mr. Walker's March 20th rodeo appearance in Austin.  Yee haw!!!

       My mom likes to leave me extensive messages on my voicemail.  We used to save them at the 'den of sin' and play them over and over again and laugh over and over again.  One time Jessie Day almost pissed herself in the back seat of my car listening to one of her messages.  The subject of the message: an air filter.  The gist of the message was that my mom and her 'friend' just changed the air filter in the barn (my home for 2 years).  She vividly described the color and contents of what she removed from the air filter.  She noted that if I were to call her back regarding the air filter, or if I should have any more questions regarding the procedure or aftermath, I might not be able to reach her right away, because she would be getting in the bath for a moment.  If I recall correctly, the message was several minutes long.

       what a fantastic, eventful, expensive, sleepless weekend.  i should of taken notes.  and i'm pretty sure my liver now has a hole the size of a baseball.  sylvia and i departed on schedule friday.  arriving in san antonio with plenty of time to kill until kick off.  you give two twenty somethings time to kill and a bottle of crown royal and what do you get?  we check into the fancy smancy wyndam hotel on the riverwalk (and no we did not break one of the posters of the  urlLink four poster bed  off and put it back on with hair gel).  we made a grand entrance with a full bladder and not enough time to get to the hotel room.  the men in suits with walkie talkies and nametags did not so much appreciate us running thru the hallways to get to our room before we ruined a perfectly clean pair of pants.  needless to say, we made it without incident and a reputation to uphold as perhaps their most obnoxious guests ever.  not so much on schedule, todd and nicole arrive to an empty bottle of crown and two giddy lubricated girls, ready to rock n roll.  despite the weather conditions, sylvia and i opted to go the mini skirt/tall boot route.  whilst nicole and todd decided to go with the full-on cowboy/cowgirl look, complete with boots that had designs on them and belts that had a fancy buckle.  we fit right in at the taco cabana we stopped at on the way to the concert.  and i got hit on by a young man.  he was at least ten years old.  he and his family both were growingly concerned about my warmth, and my selection of clothing.  the show rocked my socks off.    and there was no shortage of girls with seriously bad hair and camel toes.  we even came up with a camel-toe-spotting-hand-signal and a count.  to all the cowboys in south texas, i am sorry your selection of your cowgirl counterparts is so bleak.  i'm sorry they have not been able to let go of hairstyles worn in the 80's.  and i'm so sorry that they aren't aware that if they get pants their size the lips of their vagina would not be so obviously outlined though their jeans.  after pat green left the stage, there was nothing left to do but ride the mechanical bull.  i have a tender area between my legs that i like to take good care of and didn't want to run the risk of possible damage at such a young age, so i observed and cheered from the side lines.  since nicole was the only one with jeans on, sylvia and her were both forced to ride in that outfit.  and no, it was not necessary to actually go into a bathroom stall to strip down and swap outfits.  and i'm certain the paper towel i was holding up sufficiently blocked the view of my two naked friends from the on-lookers.  i two-stepped, my friends.  until four in the morning.  well, i two-stepped if you count me being drug across the floor with a guy while he two-stepped as two-stepping, well, then i two-stepped.    only one time did the bouncer have to come over and ask sylvia and i to quit taking off the clothing of one innocent unassuming cowboy.  while sylvia unbuttoned his shirt, i went staight for the goodies, ripping off his belt all stripper-like and swinging it in the air and across the dance floor.  on the joyous ride home, i got out of the car to pep-talk nicole through the puking on the side of the road at 4:30 am episode.  i decided to seize the moment and relieve my bladder.  come to think of it, we did a lot of public urination this weekend.  i felt at one with nature.  and wiped with a taco cabana receipt once.  nicole used a walgreens one.  we reviewed the purchases before committing the receipts to our cooters.  walking nicole to the our room looked more like a video game than an actual walk.  thank goodness for the hallway walls, for these served as nicole's guide, bouncing from one wall to the other.  a joint later, and the muchies hit.  apparently, no matter how much convincing i offered, the operator reached by dialing 1411 could not offer any suggestions on getting a 5 am pizza delivery.  who else is up at 5 am?  the front desk people.  robert, an employee of the wyndam and our creepy stalker, was more than willing to help us with our hunger.  something tells me they don't pay him nine dollars an hour to follow hungry hotel guests through hallways and lobbies and deliver stuffed chicken florentine and wild rice, complete with flowers and everything.  just a hunch.  we did eventually sleep, for at least an hour.  we had to get a jump on the day, cause apparently we hadn't consumed ALL the liquor and beer san antonio had to offer.  it started with a bloody mary and went down hill from there.  we did a saturday tour of restaurants and drinking establishments offered in san antonio, including but not limited to hooters and crabby jacks (called crabby patty's by my sponge bob square pants fan, sylvia).  oh yeah, off the subject, i've been told i have to make a post stating sarah's prediction of where i will be in 2 years.  she sees me meeting 'the one' and married and with child.  in 2 years.  from the looks of this past weekend, i'm on the right path.  what guy doesn't love a drunken public urinator?

       my current obsessions: miso soup, house salad with ginger dressing, spicy tuna rolls, and golds gym  when your focus is as limited as japanese food and free weights, there is little to nothing to discuss on a public forum, hence my brief absence from the blog.  i've really been focused on loosing my extra 7% of body fat by august (thanks to the pookiest pookies in the whole wide world side, jessie and barry, i will be spending a week in the bahamas).  trang, my lovely body fat tester at golds, oh so delicately put it that if i would just cut back on my drinking a tad bit, i should have no problem.  she was careful not to suggest to quit drinking all together, but to consider having 6 cocktails as opposed to 12.  she pointed out how pleased her boyfriend became when she cut back on her drinking, and the money it has saved him.  i've decided i would rather be arrested and strip searched by the female prison guard dike with a mullet cut (fe-mullet i believe they're called) and a gut that hangs over her gun strap, who stands with her feet at least three feet apart and her arms crossed, than have my body fat tested again.  despite this, i've scheduled a follow up visit with trang in one month.  primarily because trang told me i didn't have to quit drinking and because she told me i was the funniest bitch ever (and she pinches a lot of fat, and of all the fat bitches she's pinched, i am the funniest bitch ever).  body fat aside, i love the gym.  people are my medicine.  and there is no shortage of people at the gym.  don't get me wrong.  i am focused at the gym.  but not so focused that i can't stop to have a brief conversation or catch the name of my work-out neighbor or crack an audibly loud joke to sylvia that she needs to quit showing off (as she loads the bar with a five pound weight...this one always gets a good chuckle out of the crowd) or bat my eyes at steven (my secret gym affair, although he is not aware of this).    this weekend i am going to a honky tonk in san antonio to watch pat green and a couple hundred girls with teased hair and camel toe scream and sing along.  i'm sure this will provide some note-worthy material.

       i just remembered this.  one time, about a year ago, i was touring an apartment with this really interesting couple.  they were really knowledgeable about numerology, and it was of the utmost importance when selecting their new apartment home.  not the point of the story, but they did not end of leasing because the closet was too small and the selection of apartment numbers available were not suitable.  so, i had just recently moved into my apartment, apartment 1512 (the one in which i'm currently living), and was curious as to what   my   apartment number meant.  they did some quick calculations and answered simultaneously, "change."  boy were they right.  i love apartment 1514, and i'll miss it.  but i'm looking forward to apartment 1512.  it will be a nice change from all the change that has occurred in 1514.

       My apartment smells like pot brownie.    I baked Tony a pot brownie cake last night for his birthday.  I bought green icing.  Tonight I am taking him to dinner and then we shall indulge.  Should be interesting.  Tony never stops dancing, and I like that about him.  He is always forthright.  He does not compromise.  He is dependable.  He is a free spirit.  His company is a pleasure.    I've made a great companion.

       i wanted to share with you the email i sent out this morning, and the responses from my crackhead friends.  it's just too good not to.     i'm the drunk girl in the bar.  this is what happens when one drinks a bottle of wine before going out and dallas night club has 69 cent drinks:  i dance with waitstaff, expose my friend's wearing halter tops tits, and lose cell phones.  please forward me your phone numbers, as my life line stored all of them, and it is no where to be found.  or i'll never call you again.  ps - i copied everyone in my address book on this email.  if you don't want me to ever call you again, this is the part where you don't send me your number.  pss - don't call your neighbor's new girlfriend by his x-girlfriend's name.  they don't like that.    responses:  My dick has stretch marks.  Terri Taylor --- holla   The bottle will eventually destroy us.   until then,   Robert   p.s. glad I got to see you, if only for a moment. --- oh shit, the pss was the best. :)  love you pppppookie.  -j --- wondered where you were!!  I'm unemployed.  Write me, maybe we can have lunch together one afternoon. --- You can probably back up your phone numbers in the future at your cell company's store, just as an FYI.  Talk to you later Ambersoy --- Dumbass ;) --- 459-2222 --- hey...sounds like I missed out on a good time ;)  probably going out with the dog this weekend if you're up for something like that give me a ring, Chris --- yeah that sucks-at least you had fun. come back out to CA! --- Don't call me again beeeeach!  I'm sorry you lost your cell phone, but I am glad to see that you enjoyed Dallas --- Dude wtf, I thought your plans were to go running last night. Will you  still be joining me tonight. --- girrlll, i got this same email from Amy several months ago....   i don't know if you ever had my number in the first place but i got yours, or your old one now, but ...here it is  --- Maybe some nice, cute guy will have found your phone and will call your friends in it to get your phone back to you! Good karma is in your stars!!! --- ha ha!  what are you doing in dallas, girl? --- Calm your self, girl!  Robin --- You are CRAZY! .....did Robin tell you Kaya is walking!!!! --- 555-SLUT   my followup:   the stars are aligned.  just to keep everyone abreast on the cell phone fiasco, it has been located and i won't have to take it up the ass from t-mobile after all.  i love my phone more today than i did yesterday.  have you hugged your cell phone today (this excludes you sternberger)?  also, my neighbor just stopped by to give me more shit about you know what.

       I love keeping busy.   There is no pace too fast.   I'm a high energy girl.   I like constant stimulation (shut up Brian).    This is not necessarily a bad thing, because of all the unique experiences I get be a part of.  But it is not always a good thing either.  When there is no down time, no time to reflect, no time to sit quietly with only my thoughts, I lose touch.  I lose touch with what I want, what I don't want, what my plan is, what my plan isn't.  I think I lose a little bit of my control.  My grip on reality.  Although this past week and weekend will go down in the hall-of-fame, I recognize that I need to slow down, if only for a short while.  Put the breaks on, if you will.    I don't want to go in to too much detail about my recent experiences and hook ups, because my writing has been lacking as of late and I can't give any of it justice with my words.  And a lot of it is a personal journey and private.  But trust me on this one, the only word to describe this week is: SCORE.  Big time.    What I would like to say about all this might sound a little shallow, or conceited, or whatever.  But obviously from the archives of this blog, you can deduce that how I'm perceived has never been a major concern of mine.  But I would like to talk about the beauty and gift of being a female.  Most of what I got to be a part of this weekend was solely based on the power of this tool.  You can hate on it, you can deny it, you can pass judgment.  I, for one, am going to use it.   Julia, I would love to see a post from you on the above comment = )  Oh yeah, and three more things:  Willie Nelson and I have the same birthday.  Willie Nelson's friends smoke Hydro.  So do I.  We smoke Hydro together.  "Amber, when Willie is up on stage singing.  And he lifts his sleeveless arm up in the air, and points his finger to the sky like he does, and the fat under his arms hangs down and jiggles...think of me Amber.  Promise me that."  Sarah, I came through on my end of the bargain.

       this week has been off the hook.  311 was just the beginning.  let me explain.  st. patty's day provided me with enough of a reason to get out on the town and tear some shit up.  after green beer, and mojitos, and lemondrops, and crown, and more green beer, i was leaning.  thursday at work was painful.  the end of the work day, and my misery was soon coming to an end.  it was almost 6 o'clock.  i was already plotting out in my head which pajamas i was going to slip into the second i walked in my door.    then, just like that, everything changed.  my mood, my mindset, my plans.  the phone rings.  it's my friend amy.  the same amy that participated and encouraged the green beer, mojitos, lemondrops, and crown the previous night.  we have been put on a 'list', the vip sxsw after party list.  rumored to perform, cake.  party starts, 2 am.    no amount of sleep deprivation could keep me away from this opportunity.  a two hour nap, and a soma chased with a glass of wine later, and i was ready for round two.  we hit the town, with 3 hours to kill before the event.  shots anyone?    2 am finally rolls around, and we swindle two dudes with a pick up truck to allow seven beautiful women to pile in the bed of his truck and drop us off at the after party.  we enter the event  to a full-open bar that was trying to conserve mixers, but certainly not liquor and joan jett and the blackhearts on stage.  one short hour later, and the announcer said the words i'd been waiting to hear.  "please welcome to the stage the one, the only, cake."  unmotherfuckingbelievable.  i have to say it again.  unmotherfuckingbelievable.    work hurts more today than it did yesterday.  but more good news keeps me smiling and anxious.  todd and nicole scored us free tickets to willie nelson's sold out show.  and my token police officer friend, nick, is working the chemical brothers/n.e.r.d. show at austin music hall.  "just come by, and i'll get you in."    ummmm, four free concerts in a week.  four free dope concerts in a week.  i would call that a score.  and i'm starting to feel like brian.  it will be a good weekend indeed.

       i had a religious experience last night.  water parted and i saw the light.  311 performed at the austin music hall.  the vibes were unreal and the show was brilliant.  a couple of comments.  nick hexum is a beautiful, beautiful man.  and i think i burned more calories dancing at the concert then i did all week at the gym.  airborne express guy's name is tony.  tony invited me to go with him.  his company made an already great experience all the better.

       at least twice everyday, someone links to my blog with the words 'terri tokers den' in their search engine.  the only link it suggests to meet their search needs.  well, none other than THE lead us not into temptation.  i don't know what terri tokers den is.  i don't know why so many people are doing an internet search for it.  i don't know why i get more hits from people searching for this than hits from those doing a search for 'jessica simpson'.  but  urlLink terri  has decided.  her apartment in the dallas ghetto will no longer be referred to as 'the crack den'.  it is now 'terri tokers den'.  but the ladder will remain in either the living room or kitchen.  and the fan will not be properly hung.  and the cat will continue to shed.

       julia's post today (now yesterday), about going to a spring break destination where she can increase her chances to score with a young thang, reminded me.  i am a horrible judge of age when it comes to boys/men, whathaveyou.  not that the lack of this quality is all that important, except when you're considering hooking up with them.  then age, especially if it is still followed with 'teen', becomes a tad of a factor.  or perhaps i just have a strong physical attraction to young looking men.  most recent example.  so yesterday, i'm talking with this guy.  and, i'm feeling him and thinking to myself 'he is really attractive'.  so, i put my flirtiest foot forward, and proceed to flirt to the best of my ability.  about fifteen minutes into the conversation, i ask him the question.  the question i should really interject into the conversation within the first three minutes from this point forward.  "how old are you?"  the answer yesterday?  "sixteen."  no, it gets worse.  so, the guy, the SIXTEEN year old guy, he doesn't have his drivers license yet.  yeah, i know.  it's a problem.

       i had a dream last night that i was doing whipits  with an old childhood friend of mine, nicole, whom i'm no longer in contact with.  in my dream, we were both wearing only our panties and bras.  i've recently made a commitment to wear only my (as opposed to my neighbor's) panties and bra (or nothing at all) while in my apartment, during these last few weeks i have without a roommate.  so i see where that aspect of the dream came from.  but whipits? come again.  wtf?  i had an interesting, thought-provoking morning.  we, as a company, are offering our volunteer services at a nursing home in the area.  we went this morning for an orientation and tour.  i'm sure this experience will provide me with stuff to write about, since the gym is failing my right brain.

       sleeping was my forte.  i have never had a problem with it.  falling to sleep, staying asleep, over sleeping.  i used to be good at it.  all of it.  as of late, this is no longer the case.  for the last several weeks, i cannot fucking sleep.  i won't fall asleep until sometimes almost 3 am.  i used to wake up at 7:30 am.  however, through my new bout with insomnia, there are days when i am up as early as 6 am.  i have been on time to work almost every day the last month for goodness sake.  this is not good.  and last night was my all time low.  i was watching some educational music television, when the internet failed to assist in slipping me into sleep coma.  when i finally forced myself to turn off the television at 1 am, the last video i watched was britney spears new song,  toxic .  not only is the video fucking weird and totally suck ass, but the song, and images from the video remained in my head for the next 3 hours.  i swear i was bopping to the beat in my bed.  i need your help.  what do i do?  i am sure it has something to do with my recent dedication to working out at night.  but that's not going to change.  i'd rather be sleep deprived than fat.  my tossing and turning is keeping parker up, and making him restless.  and it is starting to effect parker's studies.  his teachers are concerned about his sleepy condition.  so, now what?  hot tea? milk?  standing on my head? more pot?  sleeping pills, brian?  help!  i miss the good ole days, when i was out the second my head hit the pillow and when i was known to sleep through tornadoes and thunder storms and sex.

       first things first.  sarah has a girly question on her blog today.  she needs YOUR girly advice.  so, readers i ask of you this:    a) if you read this blog and you're a girl     b) if you read this blog and you're a girly guy     c) if you read this blog and just have good motherfuckin' taste (which, i might add, would include all of you....since you read my blog)    you have to go visit her blog.  right now.  and comment.   urlLink crappy title .  -----  furthermore, i'm getting a little wiggy about our team meetings at work (see post dated february 26th).  i think they are trying to set me up for a sexual harassment lawsuit.  today my boss said that "the mount was an advantage"  but a lot of it has to do with "technique" and "perseverance".  in regards to carpet cleaning.  -----  one more thing.  holy fucking shit.  have a clean change of underwear, and prepare to crap yourself.  robert holley just emailed me  urlLink this link .  need sound.  -----  i need to grow up.  the world doesn't revolve around hardons and dildos.

       Apparently I have a fascination/attraction with men in the customer service industry.  Within the last week I have given my number to 1. The Airborne Express delivery man at my work 2. The front desk dude at Gold's Gym and 3. The guy that checks me in at the tanning salon and cleans my bed when I leave.  Just thought I'd share.  It struck me as funny and odd.

       i think my ability to adapt in almost any situation is one of my better qualities.  however, sometimes i adapt so much to the situation, i lose a little of myself.  perhaps only for a moment.  but it's still enough that when i look back, i'm not proud.

       for lack of better things to talk about, but a desire to write, i will bless you with the goings on of my weekend.  my weekend was not too hot, not too cold.  it was just right.  it kicked off thursday night, seeing as i had friday off.  sarah and i met at guerro's on an empty stomach (and sarah had just rode a couple of 20 miles) and thought it a smart idea to have sangria margaritas during our one hour wait.  i think you get the picture.  when the rest of my crew showed up, i was already pretty faded.  but of course, this didn't stop me.  being the soldier that i am, i pressed on.  when my friend offered to pick up my tab at the end of the meal, he was a little shocked to see 5 margaritas on there (he's lucky he didn't see our tab at the bar).  the rest of the night was spent at his house viewing  pimps up, hos down .  a great documentary about pimpin' hos (i particularly like the white pimp.  i secretly voted for him at the pimp award ceremony).  friday, ginger and i loaded up the dogs and headed to bull creek for some fetching and swimming.  in combination, these are two things parker cannot get enough of.  in the more obscure, less crowded part of bull creek, there are some lovely waterfalls and cliffs that are just divine for parker and pot smoking and meditating.  after an exhausting day at the park (ginger's dogs are a handful, to put it delicately) it was time for some sushi.  something that always hits the spot.  after all was said and done, i came home to a lovely, anticipated email that made my great day even better.  i snuggled into bed about 8 o'clock, and was out for the count.  it was a nice change of pace to go to work saturday without a hangover.  i suspect i'm a little more of a 'people person' when i'm in the right frame of mind.  when i got off work, i rushed home to change and pack to head to my mom's to see her new addition of yard art.  i had spoken with my gay soulmate, james, earlier that day, so i knew there was a 100% chance i would end up at the gayified barn (complete with fresh flowers and decorative candles) with a cocktail in hand.  we had the best time.  james made dinner (hello, the man can cook).  we discussed our future together.  his mom only wants eight grandchildren (what a relief).  we played some mad motherfuckin' yahtzee.  one problem:  i can't add.  holy shit if james didn't have to add two plus two for me.  sunday, i had breakfast at my mom's.  worked a few hours.  came home at 5:30 and slept until 9.  something came over me at 9:30 and i headed to the gym and the grocery store.  i'm pretty sure i've never been so productive between the hours of 10 pm and 12 am in my life.  i'm looking forward to what feels to be a good week.  and wishful thinking for a kick ass three day weekend coming up.

       the denver police department wished me a happy birthday last night.  the senior vice president of our company was in town our last night in denver, my birthday eve.  so he took us out for dinner and a "few cocktails."  only a few cocktails turned into more like 10 or 15 or 20.  i lost count once i switched to doubles.  after he dropped us off at the hotel last night, i felt like the mahi mahi was not enough and felt compelled to order a pizza.  so, sitting on the hotel check in desk, in walks the pizza delivery man.  i instantly start indulging.  and then extend my credit card to him to pay for my pizza minus one slice.  he became very aggravated at me when he found out i only had plastic.  so aggravated that he left.  so now it's just me, the front desk dude, and one vegetarian pizza from papa johns.  after we finish scarfing down an entire pizza, the phone rings.  it's for me.  the manager of papa johns is on the other line asking for my credit card information to pay for my eighteen something dollar pizza.  what the fuck, eighteen dollars?  fuck that.  so i told him just that, "fuck that."  and hang up to head to the room for some nighty night.  the phone rings again.  the front desk dude informs me that the police have been called.  i enter the room and notify my boss that the police are on their way, and crawl into bed in my texas shirt and palm tree pajama bottoms.  moments later, pound pound pound on the door.  "who is it?" i call.  "the police" they respond.  my boss opens the door and invites them in, walking them over to my bed.  they ask me to get out of bed and join them.  after giving me the option of clearing up my debt or going to jail for theft, my boss offers them $20.  the pizza man accepts the money, only to have it jerked out of his hand by some drunk girl in palm tree pajama bottoms demanding "exact change of $3.89" (surprisingly i could subtract after reviewing the receipt for $16.11).  after fifteen or so minutes of me f'in this and f'in that and asking the police what i needed to do to go to jail and them responding that i was fixing to be taken in, the papa johns man returned with my change.  that's when the two cutest members of the denver police force and i shared a laugh and birthday wishes were given and i was released back to the hotel room.  first person my boss tells in the morning, the senior vice president of our company.  yeah, i'm in.  happy motherfucking birthday to me.  this is only the beginning.  i need to be put on a leash.  the kind with a choker collar.

       hey julia.  sorry for my absence.  it has been a CRAZY last couple of weeks.  first, there was the beach.  the day after i got back, there was work.  in addition, the day after i got back, there was moving.  after several evenings of moving, there was some social time with special people (not that kind, that kind).  now, there is a week in denver for work.  where i am currently.  soaking in every minute of this beautiful, perfect, peaceful weather and more development in the boss relationship arena.  let me just tell you that life is really good right now.  i'm feeling positive and strong and happy and where i want and need to be.    the new apartment ROCKS, and you are all invited to stop in.  i've gotten from visitors that it feels like a 'bistro', 'cafe', and 'coffee house'.  all of which i was going for, so i think mission accomplished.  sylvia and i have a rockin' patio, where we sat this past weekend for literally hours on end as multiple friends stopped by to do their part in the patio sitting.    my birthday is coming up on friday, and i've made sure to tell every person i've come in contact with about it including, but not limited to the starbuck's cashier, our waiter at yia yia's, the front desk lady at amerisuites, and well you get the point.  lots of birthday plans in store.  friday, the day of, i will fly in from denver early and treat myself to a pedicure.  that night the old school crew (amy, carey, joy boys) will be meeting at jazz on sixth for some birthday dinner and cocktails.  saturday is eeyore's birthday party, where i will play bongos and twirl in a skirt.  saturday  night, dinner with the pops at the hilton.  my dad recently completed building this hotel from ground up in downtown austin, and they have an amazing restaurant in it that i have not tried and have been dying to.   i am so proud of him, and i know he is proud of himself, so this will be a real treat to get to admire his work together.  then, the best of all.  sunday, my mom is having a barbecue.  the best of the best will be joining me for some amazing potato salad (sorry b), ribs, whathaveyou.  hopefully my friend ricky's band will be providing us with some tunes (check out his music at permakids.com).  and there will be beer flowing from a keg.  i am so looking forward to this.  talk with ya'll when i get back.  and btw, denver weather makes my hair wonderfully straight and perfect and how i am always striving to get it back in austin.  reason number one to move here if there is ever a calling.  note to kristen:  i respect how you feel about me.  i disagree with forming such an opinion about someone based on a silly blog where my true identity and who i am at the core is not revealed.  but again, i respect your right to do that.  the thing is kristen, you might not of picked up on this, but EVERY SINGLE PERSON who comments on my blog is a FRIEND of mine.  we know one another.  maybe not directly, but through a close friend we've established a connection.  i feel comfortable revealing and joking about things that happen in my day to day life.  yes, i smoke pot.  yes, occasionally i indulge in other extracurricular activities.  yes, i enjoy drinking socially.  yes, i love to party.  but this does not make up WHO I AM.  i won't go into who i am here, because i feel confident that the readers who mean a flip to me already know.  i am not sure why i even feel compelled to humor you with a response to your outrageous assumptions.  but again, it's my blog.  i invite you to continue reading my blog (which is bizarre that you would want to not only read, but check back several times throughout your day, considering your dislike for me).  all i ask kristen, is that you keep your ugly comments to yourself.  like lauri or jen or whomever said it, this is a happy place.  kristen, please respect my happy place.

       i'm back from my vacation, and like the real grown-up that i am (i think hanging around grown-ups all weekend might of rubbed off on me) i have already unpacked my suitcase (something of which would typically of taken me weeks as i pick thru it on an as need basis), went to the grocery store to stock back up (normally i would of improvised with brown rice and canned green beans or something), and got a good night sleep (usually it is hard for me to get out of vacation/party mode).  i checked my bank statement this morning and the charge from the hotel read "sea isle condoms"  (appropriate).  oh, another funny read.  the sugar free snackwell cookies i took on the trip read "consuming too many will act as a laxative."  the trip was perfection.  i'm not going to go into too many details to protect the innocent, but it rocked.  every moment of it.  we ate some AMAZING seafood (and we ate at the yummy black's barbecue in lockhart on the way home to stray as far from seafood as possible).  we laid motionlessly in the sand for hours on end.  we drank cocktails starting at 10 am.  we rented a buggy and drove around the town and the beach (but ended up at a pool hall about 45 minutes into our two hour rental...go figure).  i met locals, including harry and dave.  locals are a trip, and if you ever make it out to port aransas you have to meet as many locals as possible (and there is a strangely large lesbian population there?).  my suggestion, get yourself a reputation and a roll up straw beach mat while you're there.  port a comes highly recommended by me....great food, great people, great eclectic vibe.  best beach city in texas.  blah, i want to eat mushrooms and lay on the beach all day today.

       it's not a good thing when you go into work to find a noise complaint against yourself.  this recently happened to me.  someone called our answering service at 5 a.m.ish to report "multiple loud kids in the jacuzzi and a dog."  my friends and i were the multiple loud kids.  parker was the dog.  i guess this resident was more pissed than the two cops that showed up at 6 a.m.ish.  and i've decided i need a vacation (and maybe some points with the boss).  so tomorrow i'm going to port aransas with the boss, the boss' husband, and the boss' best friend.  the sole purpose of this trip is to drink the $50 bottle of crown i bought today, lie motionlessly in the sand, take at least one nap a day, and try to remember to brush my teeth three times a day.  i think i can handle it.  peace out until next week.

       i went on a blind date last night.  he picked me up at seven.  he was very cute, so we were okay in that department.  he opened my car door, which is always nice (and a new requirement of mine).  i was a little surprised that he made dinner reservations for z tejas on a tuesday night, but also pleased at the same time that he had put that much thought into it.  he had his car valet parked, despite the fact that there were parking spots within a couple yards distance of the front door.  this bugged me a little.  dinner was good.  i felt like i carried the conversation for the most part, but when he did speak, he was really funny.  like laugh out loud funny.  so that made up for him being a little on the reserved, conservative side.  he made comments that led me to believe he wasn't all that crazy about dogs, which posed a huge problem (i think we both picked up on).  we ordered desert.  he picked without regard for what i might want.  i let it slide, but did take notice to it.  immediately after desert was demolished and the bill was paid, he suggested "ready to go?"  i was a little surprised at his rush, but complied with a "sure" (mid-drink i mind you).  we drive home with a forced conversation.  he parks, gets out of the car, and walks me into my apartment (not to the door, but full-on into my apartment).  at this point, i'm wondering "what now?"  after a few moments of him watching me love on parker on the floor, he says "i'm going to go now."  parker and i walk him out to his car for the odd, yet impressive part of the night (or at least the part of the night that gave me this impression of him).  he starts by telling me that he thinks i'm just awesome, and one of the funniest girl he's ever went out with (which he takes back and says "no, THE funniest girl"....of which he repeated twice, probably out of nervousness).  he then goes on to tell me that he does not want to see me again.  he explains that when a guy gets to be his age (28, only three years older than i) they become very selective, and know exactly what they want and don't want.  a little shocked at his directness, i thanked him for his compliments and his honesty.  you know, it's not often that a guy will point blank tell you something like this.  who likes to deal out rejection like that?  not in the form of an email, or a blow off.  but genuine, brave rejection.  i told him how much i appreciated/admired this quality in him, and that it was the first time i had ever had a guy take this approach.  typically, you just don't get the call or return the call, and that's how "i don't want to see you again" is communicated.  this really, really surprised him.  he couldn't believe that people just blow one another off in this fashion (ummmm, welcome to reality).  despite my initial shock, and feeling of rejection, after i digested it and thought about the situation that just occurred, i have to give it to him.  i really like him as a person.  i think it shows his good nature and character.  i'm curious as to what ya'll think?

       i got up this morning at 6 am and went to town lake to run.  it was dark when parker and i got there.  about 10 minutes into our run, we got to watch the sunrise over downtown austin.  it was incredible.  i'm not sure parker even noticed it go from dark to light, but i sure did.  i'm now running the 4 mile loop three to four times a week.  i never understood the attraction people had to running.  in my original observation of the exercise, it just looked painful and uncomfortable to me.  i adopted running into my life about three months ago, and have a whole new outlook on it now.  it is fulfilling, enjoyable, and beneficial.  off the subject, i apologize for my sporadic, perhaps boring writing the last few months.  it's not that wonderful, exciting things aren't happening in my life.  i think for a long period of time (this includes the span of time when my blog was born) things were fun and crazy, but not all that real.  things have become really real for me lately, so i've been dealing with a lot of it on a much more internal level.  but, don't wonder (as i'm sure you all have been).  i am having a REALLY good time.  making new friends, dating, and growing.  the here and now is positive, my outlook is positive.  can't ask for more than that.

       two stories for you today:  we have this resident, we'll call her sally.  sally has been unrealistic, unreasonable, and unpleasant since the day she leased here.  needless to say, she has rubbed all of us the wrong way, office staff and maintenance staff included.  about a week ago, we got several calls from her surrounding neighbors that the night prior there was a party in her apartment, and drunk teenagers were entering and exiting sally's apartment all hours of the night and morning.  as standard protocol, we put in a call to sally to give her a friendly warning that this kind of noise was unacceptable and had disrupted all of her neighbors.  she immediately becomes defensive, claiming that she was out of town for the weekend and her teenage daughter was placed in trustworthy care during sally's absence.  she defended this adamantly, and there was nothing more we could do than state perhaps the neighbors identified the incorrect apartment number.  no more than a week later, we get a call from sally that the toilet in her daughter's bathroom is stopped up.  actually, let me rephrase that.  we got four phone calls (within a three hour time frame) from sally, because that's just the kind of resident she is.  later that afternoon, after completing sally's apparently urgent maintenance request, we found closure and answers and a great fucking laugh.  what was stopping up sally's teenage daughter's toilet?  condoms.  motherfucking condoms.  i think it was quite an eye opener for sally to find that her perfect little angel is having parties with alcohol and having THE SEX, all within one week.   saturday night, i went to have a slumber party at my gsm's (gay soulmate) place for his birthday.  around 1 am, both of us drunk out of our mind's, i discover that i have started my period.  i have no products on hand, and since we are literally in the sticks with no nearby stores, i am forced to call my mom to see if i can walk over there to borrow some feminine products.  james tried to get me to settle for a swiffer sweeper, even demonstrating application.  i insisted that although it sounded like a great idea and would make a funny story for our children, i was going to take the traditional route.  so, i take my drunk, bloody self over to my mom's at one o'clock in the morning.  since my mom no longer has her period, all she has is maxi pads.  not your normal 2 inch by 6 inch maxi pad.  oh no.  she has monstrous maxi pads that stretch from the front to the back of the largest mom panties ever.  oh yeah, another small detail.  i'm wearing a thong, that would not accommodate such a large maxi pad, so i had to also borrow a pair of  my mom's sexy mom panties.  i took back a souvenir maxi pad, to show off to james and to further humiliate myself.  he compared it side by side with the swiffer sweeper.  we found striking resemblance, less the adhesive.  then my wonderful, thoughtful, sweet james got me a heating pad without me even requesting it.  oh yeah, and he had diet coke in the fridge for me.  this was at my request my previous visit.  gay dudes are so good with details.  every girl should have at least one in her life.

       i was like a tornado in my friend's apartment last night.  i knocked over a bong sending water splashing across his upgraded berber carpet and shattering the stem.  this followed me bumping over a full ashtray.  it dawned on me this morning that i have not watched television in going on months now.  i have no clue as to any season premiers or finales or whatever is going on in that world.  one caveat, good morning america.  which serves as my background noise during my hour and fifteen minute girl process each morning.  other than that, music plays in my apartment all other waking hours.  and when i say all, i mean i leave my music playing for parker while i'm away.  more times than not i even inform parker of who i'll be leaving him with.  "parker, it's you and the gipsy kings today."  sometimes, if the cd is mellow enough or i'm too faded to think to turn it off, i'll leave it playing thru the night, only to get shut off for some good morning america.  i'm really glad i've unconsciously started this practice.  i've started to try a variety of new music.  any obscure (or maybe not so obscure) suggestions to try would be appreciated...

       i have a funny update for you.  remember the story i told you about the resident with the daughter and the condoms in her toilet (dated april 5th)?  sally was what we decided to call her.  well, this morning i get a call from a resident (the resident below sally's apartment) that last night she had to call the police because she heard someone coming down the side of the building and banging into her window.  then, several hours later, she heard a similar noise.  she was too frightened to go out and look at the time, but when she glanced out her window in the morning, she noticed sheets tied together, hanging out the window of her upstairs neighbor.  looks like sally's teenage daughter is up to her old tricks.  the shit cracks me up, sally does not think it is so funny.  in fact, she continuously gets angry with us for making such allegations against her sweetpea.    my four day weekend shall be in full affect starting 6:05 pm today.  the plans are totally up in the air at this point, but our goal is to 1. horseback ride at some point 2. find a dude with a boat that wants to take out two girls & two dogs 3. camp at some point 4. swim 5. swim more 6. swim some more.    friday is a dear friend of mine, amy's birthday.  our friend matt is our official birthday organizer, and sent out the following email:   we have a reservation for 10 people at 8:30 on friday at the downtown eddie v's.    rules: 1. don't be late 2. don't bring unexpected guests 3. and DO NOT SUCK while we are settling the bill.  if you have any intentions of sucking or any sucking tendencies (not the cookie kind), please just meet at the bar after.  or if you cause big suck situations by trying to get your cost to the penny and we don't have enough cause you didn't include tip and drinks, bring a calculator.  (rule 2 should eliminate the need for rule 3)  that is all   matt, you crack my shit up.  if you ever want a dope ass, entertaining, thoughtful, brilliant, wonderfully wonderful group of friends, these people rock.  can't wait to see everyone!!!

       sylvia and i had a wonderful evening of clean, wholesome fun (well, as clean & wholesome as it gets in 1512).    went for a run with my brotherman and pfunk allstar around the ole town lake.  parker LOVES the attention he gets down there.  i don't have him on a leash for most of the run, so he just prances in front of us (he insists on being the leader) as passerbys reach down just to pet his precious little head as they run by.  he also, as i've said before, if very fond of water.  the entire run is along the water (hence the name townlake) so every chance there is a safe place to jump in the water, he takes full advantage.  he jumps in and runs out as quickly as possible to get back with the pack.  which reminds me.  he has this new thing.  anyone that has been running along side us at the same pace for any length of time has now, in parker's mind, become part of our 'pack'.  if they try to slow down or speed up, he gets very upset and runs along side them frantically as if to say 'hey man, we're back here...get back with the pack'.  then, sylvia and i went to austin park & pizza to hit some balls in the batting cages, in preparation for our upcoming softball season, which starts monday. fingers crossed, mike will be wearing his pants.  we had to hit up the air hockey table on the way out.  we both have a bit (give or take some) of a competitive spirit, so these little battles are fun (and more like full-on wars).  we then came home and decided to pop sylvia's new willy wonka and the chocolate factory dvd in.  you can just imagine.  and now for the most important thing i have to share with you today.  there is a randall's close to my house.  i rarely go to randall's, because it is more expensive and their produce suck.  but it is the closest grocery store to my house, so when i only need a few things (usually this means a bottle of wine) i head there.  i am CONVINCED that they pump some fucking doughnut smell into the entry way of the store.  there is no doughnuts being sold or made near the entry, but the smell is as strong as walking into a krispy kreme bakery.  their intention is to make you hungry, and set off every craving meter in your body, forcing you to spend more.  kind of like when you grocery shop on an empty stomach, or after a workout, or when you're high, or when you're pre-menstrual...only a little different.  motherfuckers.

       if i didn't like my gyno so much, i might of been offended when she told me my vagina was "boring and normal" after today's exam.  i got put on the "best birth control pill since jesus was born."  "sign me up, give me two, i'll take it" was my response.  so, i'm checked out and cleared and good for a year, considering i'm careful and responsible and all that jazz.  but as we are all fully aware, careful and responsible are my middle names.  i'm currently the highest bidder on ebay for this kick ass hammock chair (for the porch, of course).  i will show it to you once i'm the proud owner, i don't want any of ya'll squaring away my game.  we put the anonymous letter left on our door saturday morning on our fridge, like parker and fatso brought home an arts and crafts project from mother's morning out or some shit.  apparently our neighbor is upset about club porch.  the new hammock won't help matters.  despite this small set back, the weekend was fantabulous overall.  friday i spent recovering from the roots show and shopping at target for nearly three hours.  three hours.  they have the cutest, most affordable summer outfitting.  i also paid a visit to my greenhouse boyfriend, made a couple of purchases, played with some hardware.  that night sylvia and i went shopping, but our natural domestic callings kicked in and we ended up at another nursery looking for more plants.  how much sun exposure does this plant need?  is it a perennial or annual?  what months does it bloom?  how far should they be spaced apart?  all questions that are a part of almost any conversation involving me these days.  well, we did our duty as normal functioning members of society who do things like color coordinate impatients with mandevillas on a friday night.  it was time to go to club porch.  that night there were several bottles of wine and interesting, revealing conversations with the evening's guests.    work saturday was not different than work any other saturday, EXCEPT BUSY AS FUCK!!!  after a good litte run and a nappy nap, i was ready to head to marcus and shelly's for a little kegger.  marcus even charged for cups, all highschool like.  i'm surprised there wasn't a flier with calvin and hobbs doing a keg stand and some map to some construction site in the middle of nowhere stating 'look for the cones'.  i really like marcus and shelly.  they've opened my eyes lately as to how small this town we live in really is.  we are connected through a lot of similar people, and the connections keep getting closer and closer.  ah well, i look at it like dope ass people attract dope ass people, then eventually all the dope ass people in the town are hanging out together.  have a four day weekend coming up.  put that in your pipe and smoke it.

       totally fucking random today.  lately there has been no break.  in my personal life, my professional life, all of it.  no break.  but, as i've said before, i'm a high energy girl, so i'm okay with this.  in fact, it's really been a fucking blast.  last night tony called me at the last minute to see if i'd be interested in checking out the roots.  ummmm, yeah.  it was so motherfucking good.  if you've never had a chance to see them, you should.  what talented mofo's.  in further news, if you are what you eat (or drink in this instance) i'm a three legged monkey today.  cause i drank the shit out of those last night in between my auditions for star search on the dance floor.  seriously.  i.was.the.only.one.dancing.  i have a new boyfriend.  he works in the garden department at lowes.  he called me this morning (yes, he has my number...we tight like that) to tell me that my japanese red maple i ordered from him did not come in today's delivery.  that plant is dope by the way.  check one out.  anyways, back to my gardening boyfriend.  yeah he's married.  yeah he has a gold tooth with a star cut out of it.  yeah his name is darrell.  but i love him.  i can't help myself.  it's hot all the stuff he knows about plants.  and matching the right plants with the right person.  he hasn't steered me wrong, and he has our patio looking amazing with his suggestions.  and we have a herb garden people.  AN HERB GARDEN.  it smells yummy, and looks yummy.  what's on the agenda for this weekend?  well, today i have a lunch date with a boy i met last week at a show.  i say boy because he is twenty two.  i'm notorious for picking up the young bucks.  then off to the gym to burn some of those crown royal calories i'm so fond of consuming.  saturday i work...ugh!   saturday night my new neighbors are having a keg.  my new neighbors who moved in to my old apartment (yes, i just moved to the apartment next door in my recent move).  they rock.  they both play the guitar and sing and smoke and hang out on school nights.  all those things i love so dearly, and now i have people an arm's reach away to partake with makes me a happy happy neighbor.  i'm certain our other neighbors are not as excited about our uniting, due to rising noise levels.  oh, and i bought a plane ticket for the bahamas.  must shower.  peace out.

       fatso is the brains, parker is the beauty.  tony described fatso's look last night perfectly.  he looks like he is riding around on the back of a motorcycle.  parker's obsession with looking at his reflection has escalated.  he now finds his reflection in everything (especially turned off televisions), and then sits inches away tilting his head side to side.  if you walk in the room, catching him in the act, he will glance over at you, then return to looking at himself.  unphased.  i realize none of this means a heck of a lot if you haven't met either parker or fatso, but come by and i'll introduce you.  you'll see what i mean.  just come on in.  the door's unlocked.  we'll be on the porch.

       horseback riding jacked my shit up.    after james and my slumber party friday night, we awoke and saddled up the horses for my first ride in over 8 years.  my friend sternberger (of whom i'm trying to get in the habit of introducing as 'chris') came by my mom's to join us.  i rode boots (who gallops at free will), sternberger rode helen (who stops at free will), and james rode whiskey (who bucks people off at free will).  we had a really nice ride, even trespassing like the true shoot 'em up cowboys that we are.  the dogs worked hard to keep up.  bailey (chris' dog) sought shade almost as often as helen stopped and refused to take one.further.step.  i almost fell off the horse once, at which the boys just laughed.  and i saw places beyond the ferris' ranch i never saw in all my 20 years i spent growing there.    saturday night the only goal was to not spend any money.  and to get intoxicated.  the only thing we could come up with to keep within those guidelines?  sit on the porch.  so we did just that.  a pain killer and a few glasses of iced goodness, and our evening's company was sufficiently freaked out.  i wish my roommate wouldn't of mentioned some of my past illicit drug use to his innocent ears.  we were at club porch sit until the wee hours of the morning before turning to the bed for preparation for what might be my sorest day to date.  riding makes muscles sore in my body i never knew i had, and surely i don't need to use for any activity other than horseback riding (hence this being the first time i can recall knowing about them).  sunday, inbetween repeating "ow, my back" when there was any lapse in conversation or noise, sylvia and i ventured out to sport our domesticicty, seeking plants and things that hold plants.  for our porch, of course.  sylvia bought me the most perfect, amazing, beautiful, green, pink plant goodness for my birthday (i taught her well in the art and purpose of giving belated gifts.  actually i'm just a procrastinator and horrible at gift buying.  but my excuse is always that everyone gives people gifts the day of the event.  mine is more significant and memorable coming several days after the fact).  anyhow back to the vine, of which the name is currently slipping my mind (and i won't get up right now to go check the tag for the name of it because my roommate already thinks i'm a freak and that it is funny that i am so excited about some fucking vine with pink flowers and this would just give her further proof that i am a freak and that things like fucking vines with pink flowers makes getting up in the morning a little easier for me).  but yeah, we went shopping and we bought a vine.  and some cd's, including n.e.r.d.'s newest cd.  track seven rocks the house.  i squeezed in a run and some dominoes on the porch before retiring to what has been a stretch of nightmareless nights (this just dawned on me).  only pleasant dreams here.  monday, tuesday, and this day have been dedicated to working and working out.  not really any concrete examples to offer or recent events, but it's foremost on my mind today, so i'll talk about it here.  recently, i've become really aware of how much my job and the people that also work at the place i call my job affect me.  we are such a close group of strangers, yet not close at all.  it's a strange mix of characters (all of whom are going to be protected here), but we just work.  i have learned more at 12100 metric blvd than i've ever learned in any other environment (not including any environment containing my family).  i'm really thankful for my job.  for my job paying me, understanding me, and putting up with me.  but more than anything, putting up with me.  sometimes i have a hard time putting up with myself.  and humoring me with laughs at my need to be a smartass every 46 seconds.    i apologize for the overuse of parenthesis tonight.  btw, sylvia (who happens to be under 5 feet tall(i apologize, but that doesn't mean i'm going to stop using them)(okay, now i'm doubling up on parenthesis...i think i might have a problem)) just got upset with me for suggesting we get a stepping stool so that she can reach the top shelf of the cabinets.

       baking chicken, surfing blogs, broke, wanting to go out for my friend's birthday, but broke, and tired, wearing sweaty clothes that ran four miles with me, feeling the-six-day-with-no-post-need-to-make-a-post-obligation.  my dog is in love with his new roommate fatso.  fatso is really teaching parker things about being a dog.  it is hilarious to watch.  i've never seen parker behave so much like a dog in all of the three years i've know him.  my birthday weekend rocked the house.  i wish ya'll all could of been here.  friday night after some dinner at jazz and some free drinks from random bars on sixth, we all came back to 1512 to play music, and dominoes, and music, and dominoes until 10 am.  oh, the love my neighbors must feel for me.  saturday was eeyore's birthday.  it was a little chilly, but that didn't stop us from having a bad ass time.  i just love a FREE pets welcome festival with the biggest drum circle i've ever seen, only beer from local breweries served, dogs with died hair, people on stilts, people in costumes, people on stilts in costumes, people walking around serving homemade baked goods (not that kind, but that kind), juggling equipment strewn about for the publics use, yarn and popsicle sticks for kid art (which would explain why we spent one hour there), turkey legs, and the cute waiter from cafe java philip ("like fill-up my drink" as he would say).  dinner with my dad had to be rescheduled because apparently my dad is on my grandpa's schedule now in that he eats dinner at like 5, and 7 was just way too late for me to call for dinner.  after some trudy's and the first scene of kill bill, i was out for the count.  sylvia and i got up bright and early for a run, then headed to my mom's to prepare for the bbq.  about 25 of my friends showed up for my mama's cookin' and some crazy good birthday cake. and alotta beer.  ricky's band got to jam for a little while.  and i love james.  even more now.  he took control of entertaining both the adults and children.  he opened up the barn to the adults, serving shots like he graduated at the top of his class from bartending school or some shit.  he saddled up the horses and took the kids on trail rides like he was running a summer camp.  it was perfect.  and i love james.  i'm going to go sit on my porch now.  man, i love that porch.

       i am so done with the rain.  where are we, fucking seattle?  people are going to start dropping like flies if it doesn't stop soon.  i can see the headlines now -  suicide rates in central texas at all time high .  it's fucking june for goodness sake.  breathe.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  go to your happy place amber.  and remember to breathe.  there are two types of people i've decided.  people who only eat at chain restaurants and people who don't.  of course there is exceptions to this.  like sometimes, the people who only eat at chain restaurants might venture out and eat somewhere locally owned because it's trendy (this happens a lot in austin).  and then sometimes, the people who don't eat at chain restaurants sometimes do, because let's face it, chili's makes a hella salad (and i think barry and jessie would argue in defense of maggiano's chicken & pasta dishes).  but here's my point.  shit, i'm lousy at making points.  what's my point?  i guess i don't have a point other than the jury is still out on what i think this says about one's character.  i guess more than it's about venturing out to new eating establishments, it has more to do with people who are close minded about eating & food in general.  typically i find that people close minded about food are close minded about a lot of things.  (i thought about this the other night, but i think i have more clarity when i'm high.  should of wrote about it then.  now i just sound like a 'tard.)  and speaking of food, i am so sick of the low carb, atkins, net carb bullshit.  i know most of my readers, and i know ya'll have already thought this thought a million times.  but since i'm on a bitching roll today, let me press on.  if you want to eat healthy people, i promise you it is NOT found in this processed crap.  eat natural, eat fresh, eat stuff that grows from the ground, and more than anything...eat VARIETY.  i promise, i lost 50 pounds with this mentality (and guess what, i've kept it off, unlike my atkin's friends who can only keep the weight off when on the 'diet').  of fuckit.  i am going to be at a wedding, in the bahamas in (hold on, let me refer to jessie's counter) 38 days, 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 54 seconds.  and i will be there with some of the dopest people in the entire world.  p.s.  sylvia, i will try to be naked less often in the apartment.  i will try not to stumble into your room naked on sunday mornings to see if you want to go to breakfast.  i will try not to get up  and go to the kitchen naked to get a drink or see if there is a boy in your room.  i am only human, but i will try.

       in light of jessie's fuck all the motherfuckers post, this might not have the same emotional impact.  i have a date on sunday with a guy i showed an apartment to a few weeks ago.  he is a little strange, okay he is really strange, but i'm looking forward to it.  strange people amuse me.  when he called me to set up the date, he said something about having a frisbee, needing to pick up some meat, and me distracting a random dog owner at the park while he steals their dog.  sylvia's induction into the club went off without a hitch.  i was able to recreate my 21st by scoring a free shot for myself at almost each bar we visited.  after sixth street, we got naked and went fishing with a net in a creek off red bud trail.  sylvia then said 'enough is enough with you sleeping in the hammock amber'.  rather than waking me up like usual, she left me there to sleep out the morning.  i migrated to the bed later that morning, and woke up sleeping in the wrong direction.  i am now going to measure my nights by where and how i wake up.  if i wake up 1. in a hammock or 2. sleeping the wrong direction in my bed or 3. in someone else's bed or 4. with someone else sleeping in my bed, this will be the sign of a successful night.  i'm off to the dentist to get my teefers cleaned.  do you think if i request it they'll give me gas for a regular cleaning?  i could really use the gas right about now.  OH YEAH, AND FUCK ALL THE MOTHERFUCKERS!

       i love my job.  i just showed an apartment to a girl with braids.  when we are leaving the apartment, i glance back to make certain i've turned out all the lights and notice a black something in the middle of the living room floor, and what i think in the moment to be a snake (since it wasn't there when we first entered the apartment).  i'm confused, until i look back at the girl and it dawns on me it is one of her braids.  i am too embarrassed for her to go back and grab it, so i now have to go back to the apartment to pick it up.  gross.  (the first thing that pops in my mind while typing this is lauri's reaction to having to pick up the lost braid).  btw, when i asked the girl if they would like for me to put the apartment on a 24 hold for them, they decline stating "if the lord wants us to have this apartment, he will keep it available."  of course i'm thinking to myself "if the lord wants you to have long hair, he would give it to you."  the lord, our father who art in heaven, kept me from saying that outloud.  my roommate is celebrating her 21st birthday.  we celebrated properly on her birthday eve at this dive that serves ONLY hot dogs and beer.  the reason i put only in caps is because they are very nazi about their policies and rules.  for example, don't attempt to pay with a credit card.  even if you miss the sign that reads "hey dumbasses, we've never taken credit cards, never will, never have" they will get very angry at you.  furthermore, do not attempt to sit on top of the picnic table, for they will yell at you for that too.  do both, and you will no longer receive service at your table, but will be forced to walk your drunk ass up to the bar where they all know that you have broken both rules.  tonight, we will celebrate the momentous occasion more properly.  we will re-visit the place i kicked off my legal drinking career several years ago, BABY A'S.  then, on to sylvia's tour de 21 bars and 21 shots.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY!  LOVE YA!  BE CAREFUL WITH THE BROWNIES!  tomorrow, we will take off to new braunsfels again for some t-double o-b fun.  dating is in peak season right now.  with lots of returns, repeat offers, and unqualified prospects.  that's all i have for now.  have to go do a braid pick-up.  man i'm important.

       sometimes you have to write your roommate emails like this one....    there once was a girl named amber now amber would have periods twenty of the thirty days of the month she would bleed and bleed and bleed she would have monster cramps and she would bleed did i mention she would bleed? she went to a woman who looked at her vagina, the woman announced "you will take yasmin, the BEST (she actually used the best word) pill this side of the mississippi" amber began taking yasmin at 9 am every single morning soon, amber turned into her alter-ego she was no longer the same person amber would lethargically get thru the days amber would eat cookies, and m&ms, and cookies, and klondite bars, and cookies then, one starry night, amber opened the fridge and the peanut butter and jelly began speaking to her it called out her name "amber, come over here" it did this, so amber complied she made herself a peanut butter and jelly and ate it as though it might be ripped out of her hand at any given moment she ate it with guilt and remorse, but she ate it just the same  if you hate me, i understand.  i will buy you a new pb&j  love, amber

       i'm not feeling particularly witty or funny or anything, but if i don't make a post soon, nicole's threatened to disown me.  her kids are out of school for the summer, so she is crazier than normal crazy level due to the fact that she watches every single kid in round rock in her three thousand square foot home.  (special note here to round rock child protective services:  nicole doesn't really watch every kid in round rock, i'm exaggerating.  but she does not like her kids to be in the homes of their friends, she'd prefer the kid's friends be at her home.  she is the fun mom.  right now she is constructing a aquarium the size of her kitchen to house all the frogs and tadpoles they've been collecting at the river.  i think she should charge admission.)  yesterday, after a night of crown royal and porch sitting, i got up early and joined a group of friends to tube down the comal river.  we picked us some beer and headed to new braunsfels for some f-u-n fun.  i'm not a big fan of rapids and floating into debris, so the comal and i go together like peas and carrots.  the guadalupe was closed due to the high volume of rain, and i was secretly glad, cause the guadalupe is beginning to end rapids and debris.  i've never left there with less than twelve bruises.  yeah, so the comal.  after the last stretch of our second float down the comal, the rain began to fall.  not drizzle, not light rain, but pouring ass cold ass painful ass rain.  i actually kind of enjoyed the rain.  i think the beer consumed increased my tolerance to what would normally be a huge disappointment when it comes to something like say floating a river in a tube.  i have a date with a really cute boy tonight (a cousin to a friend of mine).  he's only seen me after 6 hours of tubing and thought "for a girl that just got done tubing, you're pretty cute."  i'm excited to get dressed up like a girly girl and hopefully surpass his expectations.  this boy is precious.  he is a total texas boy.  he frames houses and drives a pick up truck.  but also makes hemp necklaces and plays the trumpet.  i feel like a teenager...i haven't been this excited about a date with a boy in a long while.  and i promise not to call him "the boy" "a boy" or any variation of that tonight.

       i'm working at a property today located in westlake.  in westlake people drive around with bumper stickers displaying the zip code with the slogan 'not just a zip code, a way of life'.  westlake is the kind of place where housewives drive H2s and take pain killers and wash them down with vodka martinis.  westlake is the kind of place where husbands sleep with their secretaries then invite them over to dinner with the family and play footsie under the table while their wife talks about nancy's, from the country club, botched nose job.  i just got a call from one of the resident's "assistant" to report a maintenance request.  another resident called this morning to talk about the monster sex her neighbors were having and something about osama bin laden burning popcorn at three in the morning in the apartment below hers.    westlake is a funny place.  it's the best thing since crack cocaine.  i got back on 'the pill' recently for the first time in years.  not because of any potential sex, but more to control my constant flow.  adjusting to the pill is harder than i remember?  i'm eating everything within arm's reach and feel really tired.  if this is how it's going to be, i'd rather just be on my period 20 days out of the month.  any advice?

       the weekend did me dirty.  enough about that.  boys are more confusing than girls.  girls are waaaaay more up front with their shit.  boys are indirect, wishy washy, inconsistent.  i can't figure out if i'm independent or scared?  softball was fun.  we've got a cast on our team.  so it doesn't matter if we win or lose, it's still fun.  did i say it didn't matter if we lose?  yeah right.  it matters.  we got killed tonight, and it mattered.  winning is more fun.  the umpires remembered me from last week's game.  i guess me having a two minute conversation with every batter from the opponents team while playing catcher will make you stick out in an umpires mind.  tonight i was offering up a date with any member of my team to every batter if they would just go easy on us.  i also got a base hit and caught a pop fly to right field even with the sun shining directly in my eyes, which always feels good.  i am working at another property tomorrow, so i have to COMMUTE to work for the first time in over a year.  holyhell (as t would say) there will be traffic.  traffic?  what's traffic?  the worst thing about my commute to work is someone taking the turn too fast around the dumpster with that horrible blind spot.  maybe i should make it an early night.  i had a two hour phone conversation with my best friend nicole last night.  the kind we used to have not too long ago.  i tell her stories about boys and dates and parties.  she tells me stores about gattiland and swim lessons and amandee nailing the backstroke.  and we both truly value one another's stories.  nighty night night.

       as my boss said this morning, my quarter is down on the pool table and i'm next.  i feel like i'm waiting for something to happen.  something's about to change. (how strange, sheryl crow's song "a change, a change will do you good" is playing softly in the background on our work stereo system right now).  i'm feeling a little restless right now.  as weird as this might sound, i love the feeling of getting burned, but having no regrets.  i'm experiencing this right now.  as soon as the 'everytime i think of it yucky feeling' passes, i know i will look back on this with a smile.  i started watching one hour photo last night.  we didn't start it until almost 11:30, so i didn't make it thru the entire movie.  but so far, pretty entertaining.  unfortunately, i turned it off at the part where sye the photo guy was having a dream and blood gushed out of his eyeballs.  that was kind of a disturbing image to got to bed to.  i had strange dreams.  in case you haven't noticed, the weekend is here kids.  let's celebrate.

       well, less than a week after setting up my textamerica account, and i'm already having issues.  i emailed textamerica's help department, and almost immediately received the following email from shawn:   your account was deleted for a terms of service violation - although I  am unsure what that might have been, you can set up a new one if you  carefully adhere to our terms of service   i emailed shawn back, questioning exactly what terms i violated, and got the following response:   I am really unsure. The founder often deletes accounts and until very recently, we have not kept track. In fact, even now that we are keeping track, there is no way in our system to see what the reason was (if it was even recorded).   Did you say anything that might have (even possibly) been percieved as derogatory about textamerica.com or our service on your other blog? This is often the reason but it really could have been anything. Nudity in an image or posting non camera phone images (images from other sites).   so now everything is working properly and textamerica responded promptly and everyone's happy.

       please don't hold this against me, but i just got back from red lobster, or the slobster as amy calls it.  we went so that carey could give me my birthday present.  my present was a homemade card that her students made (carey is a blonde-haired-blue-eyed-english-as-a-second-language-elementary-school-teacher).  a few things about carey:  carey used to be a cheerleader in high school.  she still does routines like two bits four bits six bits a dollar when we are out partying.  carey gets drunk and takes her shoes off and runs thru bars.  carey called me after leaving my house saturday night to tell me that she got home and was hungry, so she decided to make a pizza.  she woke up in the morning with the entire pizza face down on the kitchen floor and her shoes in the bathtub with tomato sauce spread all over her shower.  carey is very open with her body and her bodily functions.  carey always smells good.  carey also happens to be the 'whole package'.  she is quite a catch, if you can catch her.  she is beautiful, and smart, and educated, and true, and genuine, and funny, and really really cares about people.  she can see the beauty in anything and anyone.  if you can't tell, i think the world of her.    okay, i have to talk about this.  i apologize for the change in pace here.  but i'm kind of in a weird place tonight.  i got a call from my mom that a good friend of my brothers, and a friend of our family, died of a drug overdose last night.    it is a demon robert has battled for years.  it is a demon my family has always battled.  it is a demon i am very familiar with, first hand.  addictions are scary.  all addictions.  but especially those that put you in the darkest place you can possibly be.  i know the battle can be won.  i just wish robert would of come out the other side.  robert, you are a beautiful person.  i hate that you lost the battle.  i know how hard you fought.  we all hurt.

       i own a jlo cd.  i'm not proud of this.  but fuckit buckit, i tell you guys a lot of things on here that i'm not proud of.  i don't know why i own the cd of such a slutty, talentless, joke of an artist, but i do.  and we played it last night in honor of jlo's most recent marriage to marc anthony.  we decided last night that we are going to play this cd anytime jlo exchanges nuptials.  i drug my down comforter and pipe out to the porch and chilled in the hammock listening to the rain.  i completely crashed the fuck out.  sylvia woke me around 1 to come inside.  it felt right.

       i don't know why i always feel weird putting the plastic separator down on the conveyer belt to divide my groceries from the others in line?  this weekend was fun and felt like a lifetime.  it's strange how some weekends can feel so long.    friday night i had a really enjoyable date.  when i answered the door i was greeted with a beautiful arrangement of flowers.  i've never gotten flowers on a first date.  parker's been given bones.  i've been given drugs.  but never flowers.  it was a nice treat.  we had dinner at this really great italian joint on barton springs.  vinny's is by far one of the best italian places i've tried in austin.  the food is authentic, the prices are unreasonably decent (i had talapia and i think it was in the ballpark of $9), the waitstaff is friendly and very 'austin', and the salad dressing is so good i asked the waiter if he could cancel my order and just bring me a bowl of dressing (to which he responded "would you like that served warm"..."however most people have it, i suppose").  but the best thing about this place is that despite how long it has been around, it has not been discovered (i.e. no wait on a friday night).  after dinner, we headed over to flipnotics.  my friend chris had invited us to see a friend of his band, deadman.  what great entertainment.  for you austinites, i believe they will be playing at antones july 5th.  definitely worth checking out.  we stopped by 6th street to have a few drinks with a group of my friends, just before the storm hit.  it rained.  it rained and rained and rained.  we decided we wanted to get wet (brian, that one's too easy).  so we left the bar to take a stroll in the storm most sixth streeters were seeking shelter from.  there is something really carefree about walking in the rain without an umbrella, without trying to salvage your hairdo, without worrying about your mascara running...with the sole purpose of getting drenched.  since we were soaking wet, we decided to continue the wet theme and headed to the jacuzzi at a spa store he manages.  nevertheless, we had fun, we enjoyed one another, and we behaved fairly decently (this was determined based on a comparative scale).  he called me the next morning to assure me that i behaved very appropriately (something i always have to check on the 'day after') and that it was the best date he's been on in quite some time.  with only a few hours of sleep, sylvia and i got up early to head to my mom's for a trail ride with james.  it was quite an adventure with some minor snags on the way.  parker, being the daredevil that he is (actually he's just not always the brightest bulb, but we'll go with adventurous here), kept a dangerously close distance from the horses.  it didn't take long for him to get completely trampled by helen.  in all the three years i've had him, i've NEVER heard him cry like that.  it was very scary, but aside from shock, he came out of the experience unharmed and a safe twenty feet distance from us.  aside from this and my stirrups being too long, the ride was perfect.  after all the trauma, james made us some cocktails to unwind.  it was downhill from there.  anytime you start drinking at 1:30 in the afternoon, nothing good can come of this.  after a few toddies at james', we had some lunchy lunch at guerro's (we were in s. austin, we had to hit it up) and then headed home to meet scotty at club porch to hang our two new chair hammocks.  then, a celebratory evening with the open door policy, as usual.  we had a revolving door of mixed company.  they came in shifts that kept the apartment lively and filled with laughter.  it was one of those nights where the conversation is not simple.  it was ponderous, and deep, and inquisitive, and educational.  another great evening.  the sun rose and then we slept.  aside from all the great goings on of saturday evening, i received the most delightful phone call.  a dear friend of mine from high school, whom i've remained in contact with, but very infrequently, called just to tell me how much my friendship meant to him.  the funny thing is, he has no idea how much his friendship means to me.  robert was my first 'crush' at bowie high school.  i adored him.  our relationship never went to that level, but we were close friends.  but, one thing about our friendship stands out in my mind and heart to this day.  as you all know from previous posts, i was overweight thru most of highschool.  a very traumatic time for a female to be overweight.  robert loved me regardless.  furthermore, he asked me to prom.  not out of pitty, but because he sincerely wanted to go to the prom with me.  robert was very good-looking, very popular, and could of had the pick of the litter.  he chose me.  i can recall to this day some of the shallow dumbfucks of bowie highschool making comments and gossip about the fact that he was going with me.  my love and respect for him is even deeper for that reason, regardless if we talk every day or once a year.  robert is a beautiful human.  sunday served it's purpose.  the most movement in 1512 was when i got off my ass to take a shower.  even the dogs did not have the energy to do anything more than nap.  tonight we had dinner in celebration of nicole's sixth anniversary of her 29th birthday.  and since i dropped the ball on her actual birthday...    HAPPY BIRTHDAY NICOLE!!!!  I LOVE YOU!!!  YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN PINK!!!

       there's a full moon tonight, so bare with me.  has anyone else here noticed that i have started referring to sylvia and i as 'we'.  what a silly question, considering my audience...of course it's been noted.  well, it's kind of creepy, i agree.  and i promise to make a concerted effort to make it stop, or at least use 'we' a lot less frequently.  my sleeping schedule is fucked.  i think it's a result of the adrenaline rush of our late night activities.  sylvia noted tonight that we get a lot done in a single day.  i pointed out to her that it's because we NEVER sit still.  we are constantly on the go (with the exception of the marathon porch sitting that is).  tonight, immediately after getting home from work, we worked on our bills, went grocery shopping for well over an hour, unloaded groceries, left again to play tennis at an undisclosed location that was definitely NOT an apartment community other than the one we live at, then worked out for an hour.  okay, i just used 'we' a lot.  fuck it, it's impossible.  i'll just have to be creepy amber.  day two of  operation moderation  (cute, eh?) and still on track.  fuck off, baby steps, okay!  (i think that was the first time i've used an exclamation point in my blog.  for some reason i don't really like them...too cheezy i suppose?  NOT the first time, however, for me to use, or over-use depending on who you talk to, parenthesis).  as soon as i figure out how to use this text america stuff in combination with my phone, there will be some fun visuals to go along with my lifestyle.  any advice would be helpful (not on my lifestyle, but on using text america...but thanks).    amber+computers+cameraphone+textamerica+pot=huh?  i wish i was in the bahamas, at a wedding, wearing a flower behind my ear, standing with b in white linen pants on one side of me and with t on the other side still glowing from her recent marriage to b as a result of the twenty tequila shots the night before.  and johnny standing in front of me, holding a yard in one hand and wearing a wrist band on the other.  and watching two beautifully happy kids in love sweet love.  which reminds me.  i love that terri refers to barry & jessie as 'the grown-ups'.  and who is it that refers to them as 'bj'?  can't recall right now, but that's funny shit too.

       memorial day weekend chewed me up and spit me back out.  on day one of  mission: four day weekend  we had some serious goals mapped out and tactics in place to achieve these goals.  memorial day weekend provided us with lots of porch sitting, very diverse company, eating and drinking with no mind for moderation, and a lot of sleeping in late.  and then, the icing on the cake.  the ultimate goal we had set forth was achieved. there was a boat filled with boys and a cooler filled with beer.  the same wagon that t fell from this weekend ran over me, backed up, then ran over me again.  today i got back on course, and have re-dedicated myself to my life of semi-moderation (or at least my life of more moderation than i had before).  more later....

       for fear of getting a bad wrap, i'm not going to discuss getting too fucking wasted last night to be in a public place. rather, i'm going to ask you to read  urlLink this article . read it once, read it twice. as a result of my dad's new year's party (the new year's before last), there is the well circulated grandma pot brownie story. what was not discussed as publicly was a couple in attendance at the party (friend's - a word i'm using lightly here- of my dad and his whatever you want to call that lady that lives with him) . the couple was a little off -as they were fans of the crack pipe- but who would of thought. this is some jacked up shit. they seriously need to do a 48 hours on this story. and i want to make a cameo where i get to say "the new years i ate pot brownies with rhonda and jimmy, she didn't seem like a violent person at all. i had no idea the new year was going to be such a rough one for them."  (you may have to create a sign on name (free) to read the article, but trust me, it's totally worth it)

       how many people can say they broke the heel off their shoe demonstrating a fairy godprincess dance for their roommate?&nbsp; welp, it happened to me.&nbsp; my outfit for jessieandbarry's wedding is so fucking precious.&nbsp; the first thing you want to do when you put it on is twirl.&nbsp; i couldn't help myself.   i had the most fantastic weekend in dallas.&nbsp; we laughed until we cried at least 97 times.   terri, thank you for providing the world with a safe haven for girls to discuss poop and all its wonder.   jessie, thanks for being so 'put together'.&nbsp; even when terri has food all on her shit and i make scenes in retail shops, people think "i can't put my finger on it, but there is something classy about those girls."   considering the x-rated "dry run" of the bahamas trip this weekend, i'm not sure any bahamas pics will make it to the website.

       for once, there is more activity in my professional life than my personal.&nbsp; i got a promotion at work last week.&nbsp;  leasing and marketing manager .&nbsp; i have an 'and' in my title.&nbsp; did you ever think that would happen?&nbsp; my manager and regional manager called me in for a "meeting" where i was flooded with compliments and praise (just what my spirit needed after a few weeks of unnecessary drama) and then offered this new opportunity.&nbsp; i am so fortunate to be in an industry that suits me so well.&nbsp; it's my home.&nbsp; my personality and talents are used to their fullest extent (this one's too easy brian and terri).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  thursday, margaritas and mexican food with two girlfriends, that have been in my life since age five, to celebrate kaley's birthday (reference previous post about her deaf parents here).&nbsp; i can honestly say they've been around for everything.&nbsp; they just don't make 'em like that anymore.&nbsp; friday, after a full day of productivity, i headed out to gina's house (the boss)&nbsp;on the lake to celebrate another friend's birthday.&nbsp; mary, joseph, and jesus can that woman cook.&nbsp; we swam, played cards, smoked cigars, and ate like it was our last meal before going to the chair.&nbsp; saturday, the original crew (better known as the joy boys plus us fag hags, only better looking than your stereotypical fag hags) got together at a wine and tapas bar to celebrate the beautiful carey's birthday.  &nbsp;  sidenote: holy fuck with all the cancers.&nbsp; that's why this world is so fucked up.&nbsp; we have an excess of people born between june 21st and july 22nd.&nbsp; or perhaps i just attract a lot of these moody, sensitive crybabies in to my life.&nbsp; (just jokes my precious little crab&nbsp;friends.&nbsp; i've got nothing&nbsp;but love for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;and you know this, man.)&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  saturday&nbsp;night (brace yourself, this might come as quite a surprise) we got a little bit out of control.&nbsp; you know if you have to take your heels off to remain balanced (and by that i mean stand) you might want to slow down a bit.&nbsp; after reaching the conclusion that one should no longer be in public when they can no longer stand without support, we headed to james' house for a little&nbsp;homosexual sleepover.&nbsp; i woke up with my shoes in one room, my shirt in another, and my skirt in the bathroom.&nbsp; why does this never happen to me at a straight man's house?&nbsp; as my brother&nbsp;put it&nbsp;in his precious-abby-no-no-side-voice when i was telling him of our wild saturday night&nbsp;"so amber, you threw caution to the wind."&nbsp; i'd say.  &nbsp;  my horoscope told me that it was time for me to go after my object of desire.&nbsp; which got me thinking of all the boys i currently&nbsp;have a crush on.&nbsp; for fuck's sake, when i list them in my mind&nbsp;like that, i realize what a walking boner i am.&nbsp; i think i'm going to change my criteria from breathing and good teeth.&nbsp; i've started work on my 'list' at the recommendation of a good friend.&nbsp; (number 19 on the list:&nbsp;owns underwear that is not overly worn, stained or holey.&nbsp; and preferably&nbsp;no cartoon characters)  &nbsp;  i started practicing yoga recently, and now i know what all the fuss is about.&nbsp; if i sound really grounded and centered right now, that's cause i've been in the downward dog for the past hour.  &nbsp;  thank goodness my posts are logical and not at all random these days.   i just realized,&nbsp; i have another cancer birthday party to go to this friday night.&nbsp; that makes like 10.&nbsp; too weird.     note to nicole:&nbsp; i love you

       let me start by saying i love portishead.  i love portishead.  okay, i said it.  and lucky for those going through  pubic hair is funny  withdrawals (nicole, you can stop refreshing your screen every 6 minutes now) listening to portishead has put me in the mood to write a little.  or at least update the blog.  i think i got stood up tonight for the first time ever.  one time in ever is pretty good odds i guess.  so, point amber.  point hunter.  please, allow me to explain the scoring.  hunter is a guy i met while watching my friend's band jam.  he asked me if we could go out, and i agreed.  i was a little hesitant, considering he ran in the same circle of Boy I Have Hopeless Crush On, but agreed nonetheless.  the day came that we had planned to meet for lunch, and i didn't feel like going/combined with nasty hangover.  problem was hunter didn't/doesn't have a cell phone and i waited until a very rude 30 minutes prior to the date to call his home phone and leave a message that i wouldn't be making it.  he called me despite my inconsiderate behavior, but i never returned his call.  i know, i know.  you can stop thinking about how bad i suck now.  okay.  fast forward to last week.  went to see Boy I Have Hopeless Crush On's band play again.  i see hunter, some three months after the initial blow off.  i buy him a drink as a peace offering.  he gladly accepts, and we chat it up for some time.  after the show, he asks me if we can try again, to which i agree.  now here i sit, showered and smelling so fresh and so clean wondering 'what the fuck'?  he didn't seem like a eye for an eye kind of guy, but whatever.  i'll update ya'll on how it plays out.  the past week has been my most stressful week since i can't remember when.  not to worry my friends, i managed to squeeze in some fun with drugs, alcohol, and gay men.  but my lord, what is it they say?  when if fucking rains, it motherfucking poors.  the blog is a happy place, so i won't taint it with bullshit that i know will soon pass and i'll be like  what the fuck was i so stressed out about?   rather, i will tell you about all of the happy things from the last five days.  thursday, took the dogs on a tour of austin swim holes, checking out  urlLink sculpture falls  for the first time.  these pictures are all i could find, but don't do it justice.  we simply had a great time.    friday, after a great run, i took myself on a tour of austin margarita joints, having more than my fair share of margaritas (mmmmmmmm, margaritas).  Strange But Cool Guy i wrote about previously met up with me and came back to my house for some card games (and strictly card games...no touchy touchy despite his persistence).    and finally people! a CALM SATURDAY NIGHT.  i rented movies (thirteen, capturing the friedmans, and monster), ordered a pizza, and drank a few natural lights (shut the fuck up, we were broke about a week ago, it seemed like a good idea).  all this with me, myself, and i.  it was greatness.  sunday is where the gay men came in.  we celebrated matt's (ladies, just another example of a sad sad waste of a beautiful man for us girls) birthday in true gay style (the invite practically had a dress code for fuck's sake).  i LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these guys.  never a dull moment.  monday was softball, in which we kicked ass despite the fact that mike did not wear his pants.  he wore pants, just not The Pants.  and tonight.  well, we all know what tonight was.  but, i look too cute.  so i must seek out something to do.  laters.

       I'm off to the Bahamas in the AM, but due to adrenaline or too much coffee too late in the day, I can't sleep. Browsing the good old internet, I found this article. More crazy talk about our friend Rhonda. Enjoy.  Grandmother tried to get custody of couple's son  urlLink   By Melissa Ludwig AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF  When the Child Protective Services worker visited Rhonda Glover and James "Jimmy" Joste's home in November to check on the welfare of their 9-year-old son, she found the boy to be healthy and talkative.  His parents talked a lot, too. They told the worker that their son was the "Second Coming" and that Glover was treating her bipolar disorder by drinking Austin tap water. Joste invited the worker back that evening to "watch him pull stars from the sky."  The caseworker concluded: "the parents' capacity to care for . . . child is questionable due to their bizarre behaviors."  Shortly after the visit, CPS spokesman Aaron Reed said, the child's grandmother was granted a protective order to separate John Chandler Joste from his parents. When a Houston court gave Glover a second chance to clean up her act and keep her son, she and the boy disappeared.  Glover surfaced Tuesday in Kansas, where the highway patrol found her and her son in a rented recreational vehicle behind a truck stop. Police charged Glover, 38, with first-degree murder in the death of Joste -- her boyfriend and John Chandler's father. On Sunday, police found Joste's body in the upstairs bedroom of the couple's Southwest Austin home. The 55-year-old had been shot 13 times.  Their son has been placed with a foster family while state authorities decide on long-term placement for him.  In documents provided by Glover's family on Thursday, the CPS caseworker describes a couple with a history of drug use, domestic violence, mental instability and paranoid delusions. The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services confirmed the report's authenticity but would not comment on its contents.  Glover's family -- several family members asked not to be named -- said they had been concerned about the mental state of Glover and Joste for several months before Glover's disappearance, and had been fighting for legal custody of the couple's son.  "Our main priority is getting John Chandler safe and was getting Rhonda and Jimmy help to begin with," said Glover's sister, Karen Norris of Houston.  Police records show that officers have visited the couple's home at 5000 Mission Oaks Blvd. 14 times since January 2002. Public records also show Joste received probation after assaulting Glover in December 2000 -- Glover's family says the assault stemmed from an argument at Barton Creek Country Club. The CPS caseworker's report said Glover filed a protective order against Joste.  Concerned about the welfare of the couple's son, Glover's mother, Sherlyn Shotwell, flew to Austin in November to check on him, according to the report. After Glover refused to let her see the child, Austin police paid a visit and found a clean house and a well-kept child, the report said.  After they left, Glover called her mother and told her John Chandler was the "Second Coming," referring to the child as both Jesus Christ and Lucifer, the report said.  When the CPS caseworker visited the home on Nov. 12, she had researched the couple's past. In her report, she said Glover and Joste had a history of marijuana, cocaine and heroin use. Glover, the report said, had received treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic and in March 2003 had been committed to a mental hospital.  A few months later, the report said, Glover called Solid Waste Services and told them Joste had killed someone, cut up the body parts and put them in the trash.  During the November visit, the caseworker reported, Glover told her all the "blood and guts" from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks had been dumped into the ocean and "has poisoned our water."  Joste then denied the couple's history with drugs and the law and said Glover drank tap water to control her bipolar disorder, the report said.  Glover also told the caseworker she had been home-schooling John Chandler for about two months with the Encyclopedia Britannica, according to the report.  After the visit, Reed, the department spokesman, said Shotwell got temporary custody of John Chandler.  Family members say Shotwell then filed for full custody in Montgomery County, near Houston. Court documents on the case could not be obtained late Thursday, but Glover's family says the judge gave Glover custody of her son on the condition that she seek treatment for her bipolar disorder, get a job and put her son back in school. Family members say that when Glover failed to appear for a March court date, Shotwell was awarded custody of her grandson.  On March 13, authorities in Michigan caught Glover trying to cross the border into Canada, Glover's family said. They released Glover because the deadline to return her son to his grandmother had not passed, the family said. The family said they did not hear from her after that. Austin police said Glover's family filed a missing person report for Glover in Houston on March 15.  "We went through every step of the legal system that was available," Karen Norris said.  Four months later, Glover's aunt came looking for her in Austin, found the garage door open, and called police. Officers found Joste's body in an upstairs bedroom.
