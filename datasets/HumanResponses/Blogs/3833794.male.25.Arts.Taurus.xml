         I.  idaho is an invented name, the meaning is unknown, but texas is from an native american word meaning "friend."  better change it to "apiguna" from the mi'gmaq word  apjigu'niet,  meaning  bleed to death.   florida is from spanish, "feast of flowers," not "feast on immigrants" as we once thought.  it is believed that iowa is from a native word meaning "this is the place." about all a person can say about iowa is that is indeed...a place.    wyoming is from a delaware word meaning "mountains and valleys alternating," an image of tremendous, constantly shifting earth.  sounds biblically hazardous. minnesota is from a dakota indian word meaning  sky-tinted water.  license plates there read "land of 10,000 lakes." there are actually 11,842, defined as  areas of open, relatively deep water large enough to produce a wave-swept shore.    II.  the street preacher says my parents probably engaged in hundreds of  conjugal acts.   i miss my parents, so i sit down on a patch of grass to hear more about them.  he says the curse of sin fell upon all mankind from the very beginning.  he says if i have not been born again he can only say one thing, that  i am going to hell.  he says "you say God is so merciful, he wouldn't put anyone in hell?  oh no?!   you're going to find out."   i continue on my way, doomed and small.  III.  "you know, the sympathy ones are hard to find," announces the greeting-card seller loudly to a frazzled customer who has been digging through the bins for twenty minutes, sweating in direct sunlight.

         I.  jet-lagged, i meet M at orchestra hall.  the orchestra plays gershwin.  the music reminds me of ballroom scenes in old hollywood movies, the ones where a man and a woman are dancing.  she's wearing a dress so beautiful all the housewives in america know they'll never have one like it, and all the working men know they'll never have a woman like her.  II.  we leave at intermission and go to the kissing room.  III.  i sleep next to J.  his cello rests in its shuck.  nearby, a closet is piled to the waist with classical music scores.  somewhere among them must be a piece written by a tired composer after a night just like this.  L sleeps beside us.  her silver fur looks black.  she doesn't know that in 15 hours she'll barely escape drowning in the flooded creek that inspired Longfellow to write  The Death of Minnehaha.   IV.  "All in the golden afternoon / Full leisurely we glide." the young goats on the farm are cute, round and wise.  V.  on the east side of the mississippi, in a garden, a kitten has been buried.  his name is stellan.  VI.  by now the goodbyes, the rows of ugly houses outside the city,  are ordinary.   (pt IV quotes Lewis Caroll)

         I.  a slight, airy cross hangs between the woman's breasts.  nose like a dancer on that one.  great choreography.  long ride into the city.  the cross bounces up and down between the breasts.  the chain keeps it stuck to the woman.  "this has been the worst day," she says to the person next to her.  "when i get to the pub i'm going to order a mix drink.  with liquor as the liquor and liquor as the mixer."  II.  don't like understanding every word people say.  jarring.  reach for estonian words every time i talk.  then realize i can leave those on the shelf.  english will do.  it's the only thing that will do.  III.  the hostage's head is made of lead and slate.  it has no human features and reaches upwards, doesn't get far.  it looks as though fingers with no fingernails were raked down one side.  nothing to say, no mouth to say it with.  it tried to form itself into a weapon, a sharp arrowhead, before it froze.  it was soft and beautiful once.  ("Head of a Hostage" is a sculpture by Jean Fautrier, on display at the Tate Modern art museum)  IV.  "i don't want botox," says the man in the deep blue pull-over. "you definitely need it," says the woman with the brown cap pulled down tight. "yeah, you need it," says the woman in the smokey pink cashmere sweater.  V.  "I don't like this," says the woman, and she walks quickly past  Head of a Hostage.    She moves eagerly toward a pretty golden bust of St. Peter  without bothering to read the title of the Fautrier sculpture,  or the curator's note: "At night [Fautrier] could hear  the Gestapo torture and execute prisoners in the nearby woods."   I don't like this ,  he must've thought to himself.  Unfortunately  St. Peter was nowhere in sight at the time.*   *When Jesus was betrayed, Peter drew his sword to defend him, but denied him later in the same night, as Jesus had predicted he would (John 13; Mat. 26.26-46, 57-75).

         "kas saad votta minu jaapani tantsu hiir?  ma ei saa votta tema kaasa ameerikasse...."  (can you take my japanese dancing mouse?  i can't bring her along to the states....)  "jah."  (yes.)  "väga hea!  tema nimi on betti.  ma annan sulle hiiri tõidu raha.  võib-olla ta räägib jaapani keelt sinuga...ta ei kunagi räägi midagi mulle.  ta ka mitte tantsi."  (great!  her name is betti.  i'll give you money for mouse food.  maybe she'll speak japanese with you...she never says anything to me.  she doesn't dance either.)  we walked together through the town hall square before i went to the airport.  it was full of merchants selling bowls made of black alder and juniper, ceramic mugs, iron hooks, and birds made of grass.  he carried betti, her cage wrapped in a pillowcase.  "some things were better during the soviet period," he was saying when we reached the other side and had to part ways.

         the young man's balcony overlooked the old woman's garden.  thirteen perfect rows of tomato plants.  two rows of carrots.  a row of peas.  she worked her garden early in the morning.  she knew it was unlucky to come between the leaves of a plant and the afternoon sun.  she went to do laundry at the first hint of a shadow beside her.  the vegetables would be sold at the market in august.  the money would buy wood for the winter.  the young man noticed that the woman had allowed herself only one luxury in her garden, a thick round bush with dark green leaves.  one day in june he looked down and saw a huge red blossom on the bush.  by the end of the week there were nearly a dozen.  he leaned over the rail and gazed at the bush.  it stood against the garden fence, alone, apart from the rows of vegetables.*  a week later, as the young man laid his laundry out, he noticed a pool of red petals lying in the dark earth beside the bush.  the blossoms were as huge and bright as ever, but over the next two days the pool grew.  the tomato plants held their light leaves up to the sun.  the carrot stalks, shy little dancers, stood still and quiet.  but the nearby flowers gave their petals up, not to feed anyone or to provide wood for a winter stove, but so that the young man would know what had been done to the old woman.  during those weeks when the bush blossomed and began to bleed, she was nowhere to be seen.  the young man went out onto the balcony each morning , each afternoon, and each evening.  he looked for the old woman, then looked at the bush and wondered where she had gone.  one morning he stepped out and saw that the flowers had vanished and the soil was dark and blank.  the blossoms had been plucked off and every last petal lifted from the earth.  there was no color left in the garden.  every last trace had been carried away.   *In 1893, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the tomato was a "vegetable."

         the king was uninterested in what was happening just outside the castle, but took great interest in the events of faraway kingdoms.  each day he cried out to his chief eunuch, "any word from france?  any word from brazil?"    but on the 5th of october he was in a new mood.  "eunuch!  why don't i care about faraway kingdoms today?"  "sire, no man, no matter how great, can be concerned about distant matters day after day!" replied the eunuch.  the king sent the wise eunuch away and picked at his cape.  he picked at his crown.  he banged his scepter against a curtain and moaned.  "my carriage!" he wailed.  "eunuch! come!"  the entourage gathered in a flurry of bright cloth and horse skin.  the whole mess rattled loudly out of the castle, through the town, and into the country.  "what are these sloppy treed islands in the middle of my fields?" the king asked.  "my king," replied the eunuch, "these date from the birth of the field, when the farmers removed the rocks from the soil.  they piled them in a heap, then plowed around them year after year.  and so flowers, grass, and trees grew around and over them.  look there: storks nesting at the top of that Paradise Tree!"  the king thought of his royal potatoes, his royal beets and juicy mutton.  "what do these birds eat, eunuch?"   "eels, sire!"  the king ordered the carriage return to the castle at once.  each day thereafter he cried out to the eunuch, "any word from france?  any word from brazil?" and smiled, to be a man who could ask such questions and eat well every night.   * the king and his chief eunuch are based on the characters of the Shah-in-Shah and Patominos created by Joseph Roth in his novel _The Tale of the 1002nd Night_, translated into english by Michael Hofmann (Picador USA 1998).

         Odysseus murdered the loose servant girls-- we weren't told that he took their bodies one by one down to the sea and stripped them, ran one hand over each breast and one  between the legs before releasing them into the foam wake.  It is something any tyrant or hero would have done outside the pages of literature. No law forbids a man to feed his stomach, or to starve, waste, and hate his soul.  The figures of men darken the shore-line; they caress whatever is beautiful in those who bleed at their feet.  They wait for the sin to wash away in the tide, but it reddens the sand, and it stays. This place, where the rocks and crags give way to soft earth and water is where poets have come every night for centuries to find what remains and carry it back up to the grass and trees.   *originally published in Water-Stone Review, Fall 2003

         july 18-22 (new york, usa)  I.  the old man with the american flag waving shinily on his black plastic helmet looks triumpant.  he rolls backwards diagonally through a busy intersection, pushing lazily with his one leg.  the going is slow.  one cab driver honks in disbelief.  the other drivers wait very quietly.   II.  “absinthe?” J. offered. “I’m not going to drink it alone....”  “ok, less than a shot, though.” i followed her into the kitchen to supervise.  she pulled out two tall mojito glasses, poured generously into each, dipped the sugar cubes, set them burning, dropped them in, and her poetry caught fire in the other room.  I was crouched over the pages trying to stamp out the flames when D. announced that he was going to the 24 hour mcdonald’s for burgers.  i never saw him again.  i woke up sweating in the july heat at 10am and made my way downtown on the f train.  i'm still finding ashes in my hair, between my teeth.  III.  * “you  swore  in class today!   fuck this, fuck that.... ”  K. was drying a cutting board, or cleaning a glass, or trying to scrub an ink stain out of a pair of jeans.  it was some agitated thing a mother would do by a sink, beside herself at her careless son’s actions.  he had done something rude, and the other mothers would discuss it as a failure on her part.  “ they  swear,  we  don’t swear!”  i looked sheepishly up at him, noticing how nice his skin looked.   blondes tan so well,  i thought.  in my lap, a translated fragment of sappho gaped.  it didn’t make a bit of sense.  i turned the page.  none of them made any sense at all.  * “If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not listen to the voice of his father or his mother, even when they punish him, his father and mother must take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.’ All the men of the town must then stone him to death. You must banish this evil from among you.” –old testament (Dt. 21:21)  *  To lose face  is a translation of the Chinese  tiu lien.
