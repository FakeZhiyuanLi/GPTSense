      My cover has been blown, Bun-Bun has discovered the place where I talk to myself and hope that nobody actually cares enough to listen.  I can already hear Alex referring to me as a "Touchy-Feely-Pussy-Girl" at school.  I leave to do a tour of drill instructor duty at Fort Hunter Liggett this saturday, unfortunately its Advanced Orientation, so I'm laying the smackdown on 15 ten-year old kids who can't sit still for a week.  AO is the wild west, and Seaman (Airman soon, motherfuckers!) Montgomery is the new sheriff in town.  Or Deputy Marshall.  Or a wandering vigilante whose parents were killed my marauding League Cadets when he was just a wee lad.  But most likely I'm the yeoman.  *Does his little yeoman dance*

      It's 0233 and I've got insomnia... Slept over 2/3 the day yesterday and I'm not even close to being tired.  It's so boring walking around the house alone that I wish I could fall asleep.  I've been keeping myself content eating boxes of triscuits and doing this blog crap.  It's beginning to become very therapeutic, I've always wanted a place to complain about things.  I lost my USMA candidate number and password, so I'm pretty much shafted unless I want to go crawling to my MALO begging for him to bail me out.  I intent on floating lethargically through Sunday in a symbiotic relationship with my rack.  No church Monty?  Oh well, I'm going to hell anyway. Me, Hitler, Charlie Manson and Beelzebub can get a poker game together every other Friday.  I think I'll go to CenterStall and watch BJ Hall bring the pain over and over until breakfast time.

      My attempts trying to be an intellectual:  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they  did  for themselves, and became richer.  -Benjamin Franklin, The Encouragement of Idleness, 1766   The inherent vice of  capitalism  is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of  socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.      - Sir Winston Churchill         How do you tell a Communist? Well, it's someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It's someone who understands Marx and Lenin.    -Ronald Reagan         Communism doesn't work because people like to own stuff.       -Frank Zappa   Alas, it is all for naught.

      That post title is so cliche.  Don't waste your time on this blog.  It's nothing but a gigantic load of bullshit.  Who the hell reads this crap anyway?  Am I so egotistical I think that people from all over the globe who probably don't know me waste valuable time reading a site about my life?  Tell you what, if you're still reading this right now, you need get new direction in your life or something.  Stop reading this, your life is ticking away and you'll be worm food soon.  Go outside.  Do some community service.  Make sweet love. Pick daisies.  Frolick in the meadows.  Carpe Diem or whatever-the-fuck.  Join the military.  God knows they'll give you enough trivial pursuits to occupy you besides read this.  Monty makes a blog?  That's got to be one of the harbringers of the Apocalypse.  I've always fancied myself as an Antichrist...  but really, is there anything I can say to satisfy your desire for tasty tidbits of information on my comings and goings?  Are you not entertained!?  Maybe its just me... being very... very... bored.  Rest in Peace Superfreak...  Rick James 1948-2004 "Cocaine is one Helluva Drug"
