        In School...    Right now, I'm in the computer lab, supposed to be looking for information on garbage user fees. But, I'm checking out Will's   Howitzer Puppies . These are genetically engineered puppies, to take over the world. More on this later.

       I am in charge of the secret farewell present for someone I will name Lousie. Mid-June, she'll be leaving for South Africa. It turns out that she has already planned her own farewell party and  everyone  must bring something for her that will remind her of us. So the entire hackey group (except for Thomas) took 15 minutes of Science to do a digital photo.  We took two photos, actually. On the first one, Lauren gave Samie bunny ears.  Real  mature. Seeing as it was a  digital  image, we saw it instantly, and Samie found out instantly. She then, of course, demanded another shot (it  is  Lousie's farewell gift after all).

       Man, Ã‰tudes Canadiennes is really boring. We're doing  more  research for our stupid debates. Mine is really simple. The proposition, you ask?  User Garbage Fees Should Be Implemented . The answer is really simple. If Garbage Fees are put into place, then a  whole  lot of illegal dumping will take place.  Yup, you guessed it, I'm posting instead of working again. That's because  I'm done all the research I need!  Crazy.  Today marks the day when I enter the 21st century. I just bought a new digital camera. It's a little piece of crap (600 kilopixels) that is just used for point-shoot-download-then-upload to the web. Expect my photo here anytime soon.

       Man, oh man, was that a crazy party last night. But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started in math class, where every day starts. I mean, seriously here people, math is always the first class of the day. Our regular math teacher couldn't be there, because she was coaching the girls' soccer team. Therefore, we had a sub. He normally taught Social Studies, but was brought in anyways. Seeing as we had a sub, everyone came over to sit at my table, mainly because I'm so cool. Will and I were working together on the math homework, and the sub came over and left us an interesting anecdote.   You know what happens when you wear a toque like that in the middle of a hot, summer day, don't you?   Um.. no.   It's the main reason why I don't allow hats or toques in my regular Social class.    [obviously disinterested]  Really.   Your toque doesn't let any moisture escape, and you know what that does to your scalp, right?    [fairly monotonous]  No, why don't you share it with me?    [not picking up on Will's hints]  Because of all the excess moisture, your scalp becomes all saturated and pruny&#8212;   uh-huh   &#8212;and then you know what happens?    [evidently annoyed at this point]  No.   Your hair falls out. It's an early sign of male pattern baldness.   Wow. Thank you for that disturbing thought. I'm doing my math now. My toque is still on my head.    After that was &#201;tudes Canadiennes, with  another  sub. As always, even though we already have a load of crap due very shortly, M. Sokalski left the sub an assignment due at the end of class. We had to find 10 difficult words and define them, and then summarize the promises of  all the federal political parties  of Canada. Most people in the class were complaining about the fact that it was too hard, so the sub decided that a communal effort was in order. I decided to forge my own trail and do my own work. To aide my brain, I decided to listen to  urlLink Strong Bad Sings .The sub, however, didn't like that. &ldquo;The human brain is incapable of doing two things at once.&rdquo; What he didn't know is that Will (who was also listening) and I are  excellent  debators. His main argument was that talking on a cell phone while driving leads to a lot of deaths, I mean, a  lot  of deaths. We countered with the fact that every car is equipped with a radio, and if you can  drive  and listen to music (i.e. multitask) then you  should  be able to  write  and listen to music without major problems. It was also been proven scientifically that the human brain can concentrate on up to 4 tasks  at the same time!  However, since the classroom is an autocracy, he won.  We still forged on our own. I wasn't  really  listening to him and the rest of the class, however, I do know that he talked about the Mandarin language for at least 15 minutes. During this time, I became really bored  (wink wink)  and rested my head in my hand. My hand happened to be holding an earpiece. I don't know how it got there. After a couple of songs, though, he noticed and threatened to confiscate my discman if I did it again. So, I turned it up real loud (which with headphones in isn't loud at all) and listened with it on my desk very quietly. In case anyone's keeping score, the class finished about 5 of 10 difficult words, and I finished about 5 words too. However, I decided that a summary of the political partied would be more beneficial to me and finished that as well. It's something I call " time-management ". All while doing the impossible multi-tasking! Hah!  Next came lunch, which was extended by about half-an-hour to incorporate a live band, BBQ, and the  Big Ollie Contest ! It was enjoyed, however, with a good toss of the disc.  Nothing else exciting happened except for the party. The walk to Louise's house from Kelvin is about 15-20 minutes. A ride would take about 3. And it's less energy expended by my body. So when Samie offered Lauren and me a ride, I naturally accepted. I didn't know however, that it would include a trip to Costco and then Samie's house. It added about an hour and a half to the 3 minute trip. But it was still a cool party.  Phhew! I have to get out of the house. This will be finished later.
