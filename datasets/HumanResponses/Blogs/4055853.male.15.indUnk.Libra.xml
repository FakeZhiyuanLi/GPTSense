       I'm here to inform the good people of today that this country is run by a bunch&nbsp;of people whose sole entertainment is pointing at a tree and laughing, or finding yet something else to take away from us:&nbsp; freedoms, almost got paintball guns, and VIDEO GAMES!!!&nbsp; Sure, they couldn't take away the games from us, so they gotta go and bitch about how influental these games are to our young children's lives, and get letters slapped on the front of every game box.&nbsp; For God's sake, please tell me how Grand Theft Auto can teach me to hold up a school and demand all the tea in China?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if they think they are protecting our kids from violence, oh ho ho,&nbsp;the kids will be all that more surprised when they find out guns really hurt, and knives aren't just used to cut dinner anymore.&nbsp; Keeping people from finding about violence all their lives is as futile as stopping a speeding semi truck with a hockey stick (pretty damn futile).&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; I'm rebelling.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; My grandparents (overprotective, dammit) don't know this site exists.&nbsp; That's right, I CAN WRITE BLOGS!!!&nbsp; What was I talking about again?&nbsp; oh yea, and that is the history of the apple.&nbsp;

        Well, hello kiddies.&nbsp; If you are reading this, you are one of three people:      1.&nbsp; One of my friends I've given this site to (sucker),      2.&nbsp; Somebody scrolling through the blogs available and finding&nbsp;"I'll Escape One Day"&nbsp;a particularly interesting title (wtf?), or        3.&nbsp; A robot sent from the future to destroy me and prevent me from leading an army against dozens of bastards like him&nbsp;(I smell a crappy movie series.)       Anyway, I rarely get so infuriated I have to go and sit in front of my computer and pour out my feelings to an anonymous audience, so don't expect many interesting updates.&nbsp; Alright, that's my intro, have a nice   urlLink  !@#$%ing    day.

       It seems we have 1 1/2 smart people (Im not gonna fully count Chaz's dipshit answer, but I cant ignore it either) and an undecided.  We'll have god's response at the end of this blog.  Jenny, I must say, U WILL JOIN THE ALLIANCE OR YOU WILL BE THE RESULT OF THE DEATH OF A SMALL ANIMAL AND YOUR MICROWAVE'S EXPLOSION!  Well, if you do say no, we'll conquer the world without you.  We don't need you.  Now... the time we've all been waiting for... GOD'S ANSWER!   ...   ...   ...   ...To be continued...            ...Ok, that was gay.  He said he'd come, but only if the killing was righteous and deserved.      6 positions left on the team of destruction.            Chaz, I am your god.  Bow to me.      I  c  a  n   d  o   r  a  i  n  b  o  w   t  o  o  ,   j  a  c  k  a  s  s

       I am about to do something incredible.  It's so !#$%!in awesome, the world would bust in two if it weren't against the law.  I am about to make a proposal, something so collossal, refusal to comply with this proposal will result in the bombing of a small neutral country.  I propose that we stop this small insignificant war between Interlude787 and Will92988.  I propose WE JOIN TOGETHER AND TAKE OVER THE WORLD WITH OUR MIGHTY WORDS!! Yes, my friend, Interlude, this alliance will leave the world and many others for the taking.  Oh, and Tako can come too.  And God.  God may come as well.  Will we use this combination for good or for evil?  Stay tuned on my blog site...      Or... you could just watch the news for big happenings.      Any others wishing to join must send me a check for 20,000 bucks, made out to Will, Ruler of the Freakin Galaxy, and must come to tryouts.  Only 10 may join.  Positions are given on a first come first serve basis.  It's your future.  You pick which side to be on.

       Here's some shit ive always wondered about:      1.  Isn't Toys R Us the most mystifying name of a commercial concern uve never heard of?  What does it  mean?   Are they saying they believe themselves to be toys?  Do their business executives carry around cards saying "Dick R Me?"  And why is the R backwards.  Surely not in hope or expectation that it will enhance our admiration?  Why, above all, is it that even though there are thirty-seven checkout lanes at every Toys R Us, only one of them is ever open?      2.  Generic thing I've always wondered about, fitting the number two.      3.  Why do people have to believe they are higher than others?  It is obvious I am the highest being alive (allowing room for Maddox, of course)?  Isn't it obvious that Interlude is actually a bottomfeeding bastard following his own dick to destinations we have never heard of?  Is it my fault he is about to die?  Yes, but I'm done here.      4.  Why does America suck?  Wait, I think I already got this one figured out:   It starts with a "G"   It ends with an "H"   It has a middle consisting of "eorge Bus"   It's not  fucking bus   He is a total asshole.      5.  Why do people believe I am speaking to them when im not?  If i'm speaking to you, then you'll know it.  You'll also be someone of importance.  You'll also not be Interlude787 a.k.a. Chaz.  You'll also realize that if you're name is Chaz that, i'm just screwin with your mind, and you are about to die by dinosaurs spontaneously bursting out of the ground beneath your feet.  I want you to know I have instructed them not to hurt the cats or kittens, but I cannot be held responsible for any casualties.  I also want to warn you to not, I mean,  do not get in the car!       6.  Why is it you people have continued to read this far into my blog when it's obvious that I have run out of things to rant about?  !#$%! you all!  That's right, I censored myself, because unlike some people *cough*Chaz*cough**cough* I have respect for others I have deemed great enough to respect.  Have a nice day.  Also, if I have found a number of comments surpassing 10, I will have Chaz's head.  20 or more, and you will never see him again.      Remember, follow your hear, to whatever extent.  If u don't, you'll never know what would have happened if you had...   ...   well, i guess if u had,you wouldnt know what would have happened if u hadnt      So the answer to life is...  Schfifty-five!

       Call me mean names.  Go ahead.  I will remain strong, even against your wishes.  I WILL NOT GIVE INTO YOUR DEMANDS!!!  You know what these evil, shiteating, empty-box fucking, ass-spelunking fuckheads deserve?  They deserve to have several illegal refugees shoved up their ass.  I would do it myself if it weren't for the fact that they might not like this approach, seeing as their head would be halfway up someone else's ass, and seeing as there's no such thing as drug payment. They quite frankly want nothing to do with it.  I wouldn't either.  But I would do it otherwise.      Once again, may I say the following sites are worth it?       urlLink www.Takomora.blogspot.com     urlLink www.interlude787.blogspot.com          You gotta hate me.
