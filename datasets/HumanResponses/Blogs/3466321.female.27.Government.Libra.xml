      As mentioned in my DINKUM* musing earlier today I went to a forum on Social Disadvantage yesterday where a social enquirer of some acclaim - Tony Vinson presented the basic findings of his recent report into social disadvantage in NSW and Victoria.    Tony Vinson has looked at a range of indicators to identify areas in NSW and Victoria most in need of long-term intervention and assistance to redress entrenched cultures of disadvantage. The indicators he considered included low birth weight, early school leaving, child abuse, early imprisonment, etc. He measured the occurances of each of these indicators in each post code and used this data to develop a picture of the most disadvantaged areas. The results are very conclusive highlighting a number of areas that score highly across all measures of disadvantage.  The really compelling part of his research is that it is longitudinal and shows some intriguing patterns of improvement and worsening of social disadvanatge in particular areas.  This research is likely to be an invaluable tool for social policy makers, governments and service providers to help them identify areas most in need of services and resources.  The important message not to be lost from Tony Vinson's work is that long-term intervention is the only way to overcome entrenched and intergenerational disadvantage. He is very concerned about the 'three-year-term' political approach to government intervention in socially disadvantaged areas and is adament that only with long-term (ie 10-20 years)programs of intervention and assistance can the cycle of inherited disadvantage be broken.  I will hunt out a link to more information so you can find out more about his work and how to get a copy of his report.  Really great stuff.  *For the uninitiated DINKUM is my acronym of choice to describe the 'yuppy-me'. It stands for Double Income No Kids and Un-Mortgaged

      I have recently been pondering the human condition of 'Too Much is Never Enough'. The drive that makes us always want just a little bit more money, a slightly bigger house, just one more pair of shoes, just one more shade of red lipstick...  I was at a seminar yesterday on Social Disadvantage (see my post 'Social Disadvantage')which I suppose is as appropriate a place as any to discuss human greed. A colleague and I got to talking about happiness and she was saying how she'd read a book or seen a docu about a British pstchologist who was talking about the 'Too Much...' condition and how it keeps us from ever really being happy. She reflected on how she and her husband had lamented "If only we had $15 000 more..." when looking to buy their Northern Beaches (Sydney) house some 5-10 years ago. She concluded though that no matter how much further they had extended themselves there would always have been a bigger, better, more beautiful house with a slightly better view or slightly larger garden to make them yearn for more than they could afford.  We moved on to indulgences like eating out. I explained that my husband and I are really rather keen on the posh nosh and have enjoyed some of Sydney's yummiest establishments (hopefully many more dining experiences will follow). I explained how when I was at uni I'd think seriously before going to a restaurant with $15 mains, now I don't look twice at a $625 group bill for a Tuesday night dinner with a few friends.  Our dining experiences have reached such relatively dizzy-ing heights that I find myself contemplating a $250/head meal to celebrate New Years Eve without a qualm in the world.   It is musings like these that these that help me to begin to understand the $250 000/month divorce settlements based on 'basic living expenses'. Even when you have everything you always want more. No matter how much money you spend there are always other things you'd like to buy.  If you allowed yourself to take your feet too far off the ground you really could end up a long way from Kansas.  A Four Corners doco this week quoted a guy from the Australia Institute saying "Consumption now is people spending more than they can afford, on things they don't want, to impress people they don't like".  Where do you go from there?   Lucky for me my only real vices are food and lipstick and I can still get as much enjoyment out of two potato scallops and $2.00 worth of chips as I can get from a $110 dining extravanganza.

      What does the phrase 'Silver Ring Thing' mean to you? Does it sound like some kind of annally focused sexual act? Or perhaps you're thinking of the top of a bottle of Bundeberg Ginger Beer? Well in fact it is the name of a 'pro-abstinence' movement in the United States. I don't mean abstinence in the sense of 'no beer until Friday' I mean the 'no sex before marriage' kind of abstinence.   On the weekend I saw a show on the 'Silver Ring Thing' which receives funding from the US Government to run abstinence focused 'sexual education' in American schools. The geniuses behind the 'Silver Ring Thing' propose that the only way to be safe is to not have sex.  That the only way to prevent 'having your cervix burnt off due to cervical cancer' or to reduce the risk of genital warts is to abstain. They do not teach kids about anatomy, relationships or contraception - they simply say 'Just Say No.'  They don't stop with government funded school 'education' campaigns though - they also tour the country hosting Anthony Robbins style evangelist seminars where they get young virgins to talk about how cool it is to 'save yourself' for your future husband or wife and how uncool it is to 'touch or have sex with' your teenage boyfriend or girlfriend. They talk about how 'grossed out' they are when they go to parties and see 'all this sex going on' and how uncool they think it is that young girls get around wearing 'dental floss' for clothing.  When I see these young virgins I'm reminded of the preppie prom queen from the 1990s teen angst classic 'Pump Up the Volume' who microwaved her pearls in rebellion against the unrealistic expectations of her straight-edge parents and teachers who have totally unrealistic expectations regarding what is acceptable teenage behaviour. What happens when these trainee evangelists decide they'd rather like to have sex afterall? What happens when the halo slips?  The 'Silver Ring Thing' round these young kids up into a huge stadium with thousands of other kids, whip them up into a frenzy, whack a silver ring on their finger and convince them that their natural sexual drives are dirty & evil and that they should either abstain or get real good at keeping secrets.  I can't believe that someone who cared about the welfare of their children would really promote abstinence only 'sex ed'. How could anyone honestly assert that its safer to keep kids in the dark about the fundamentals of sexual anatomy and safe sex practices? This is how they get kids in the US drinking litres of Mountain Dew or douching with Coca Cola in the belief that it will act as a contraceptive. Also how they get teenage girls giving birth to babies in their wardrobe before wrapping the baby in a jumper and throwing it out with the garbage. Secrets and lies are no good people!  The great news is that the 'Silver Ring Thing' are receiving extra US Government funding to take their show on the road into developing nations. Another wonderful example of the altruism of the greatest nation in the world.  The quote of the day has to go to the guy who stood up at a debate between 'Family Planning' and the 'Silver Ring Thing' and said "Hey I'm a teenage guy and I practice abstinence...although not through choice! What I want to know is why don't you promote masturbation instead of abstinence as the safe sex alternative? Nothing wrong with a bit of self-love...ain't gettin no diseases from that shit."

      There have been two major events in my life this week that have changed how I feel about where I live. I wish I could say that it was the news that the Howard government is moving full-steam-ahead with its plans to legally redefine marriage to exclude same sex couples and to prevent these couples from fostering or adopting children (is there an echo in here? I thought I heard this rubbish from another conservative moron earlier this year?). It would even be OK if I said that the major life-changing event was the publication of horrific photographs of sleazy exploitation of Iraqi soldiers in Baghdad...  But no! The two big tragic events in my life this week have been:  1. The Australian public voting to keep Perth in 'My Restaurant Rules'  2. The opening of a 'Gloria Jeans' on King Street Newtown.  In relation to the first I was absolutely appalled that once again Australians proved themselves to be self-deprecating champions of the mediocre. The Perth couple were in my view an absolute abomination. They had no style, no taste in food and no business sense. They were given this 'opportunity of a lifetime' to open there 'dream restaurant' and what do they produce? Steak sandwiches, fish and chips and a chocolate fondue (actually the fondue was kind of cool...but that's beside the point). In comparison the Melbourne couple had oodles of styles, great business sense and really excellent taste in food. They were slick, schmick and totally on the money.   I knew things were going badly when I saw the crowd that gathered in Perth to support 'Ash and Amanda'. All the contestants (except the worthy couple from Brisbane) and half the judges chose to be with Perth rather than Melbourne. Mind you I'd rather have the chefs from Sydney's acclaimed 'Aria' and 'Aqua Luna' restaurants on my team than an air-headed food reviewer from 'New Idea.' This was a very telling sign indeed. The popularists were with Perth but the aficionados were with Melbourne.  When the results cam through on Sunday night I seriously contemplated emigration. How typical of Australians to vote against the couple that had it all going on. Melbourne were too good, too confident and far too likely to succeed in the restaurant game for the voting public to support them. Don't we just love to back the underdog! Cringe!!  My second crisis this week had me packing in my post code rather than my country when I noticed that a 'Gloria Jeans' had opened up in the heart of Newtown. No one could miss the past half-decade of gentrification of the strip and the encroaching presence of designer clothing franchises but who would have thought that the street renowned for its cafe culture would stoop so low as to lease its prime real estate to an American juggernaut and purveyor of skinny-half-shot-caramel-lattes??!!  I could not believe my eyes when they opened the 'cafe' and was positively dumbfounded when I saw people in there...drinking these coffee flavoured beverages. What are these people thinking?  There are so many cafes to choose from in Newtown. Really people...it is safe to drink and eat at independent un-branded establishments. Just because these indi coffee houses don't have a franchise on every city corner does not mean that their products cannot be trusted. Far from it. How could you possibly prefer the homogenised mass-produced rubbish at GJs to the homecrafted whole food offerings of the Newtown locals?  About 7 years ago the Newtown community successfully forced the closure of the Newtown franchise of the golden arches...I really hope that the introduction of the coffee flavoured giant does not signal an end to culinary and philosophical morals of the 'hood.

      This is one of my favourite winter recipes and is very yummy:   Cake     2tbsp Butter 1/2 cup white sugar 1 egg 1 tsp vanilla essence 1 cup self raising flour 2 dsp cocoa 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup crushed dark chocolate  Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Alternately add the egg, flour, cocoa & milk - stirring well. Fold through the crushed dark chocolate (I like to crush it by wrapping the block in&nbsp;a tea towel and giving it a good smashing with the rolling pin).&nbsp;Pour mixture&nbsp;into a greased deep casserole dish.   Sauce :  1/2 cup sugar 2 dsp cocoa 1 1/2 cups boiling water  Sprinkle the sugar and cocoa over the cake mix in the casserole dish. Gently pour the boiling water over the top (the water filters through the cake mixture during baking taking cocoa and sugar with&nbsp;it&nbsp;to create&nbsp;the juicy sauce at the bottom).  Bake at 180 degrees (moderate oven) for 35-40 mins (until cake springs back to the touch and a skewer comes out clean).  Serve with vanilla ice cream..mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
