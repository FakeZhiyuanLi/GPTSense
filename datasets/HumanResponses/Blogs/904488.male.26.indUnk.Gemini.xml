      Ok, here we go... so the idea... yes, an idea, an zine, a network, a movement. As john puts it, a beautifully-lame poetic gesture. As the summer approaches, it is time to begin again.  We've been working for some time on making a beta-zine, a feeler, a tester of sorts to see what kind of interest we can generate. and by being as alienating as possible, by talking about pain, and heartbreak and all sorts of personal sappy shite, we should quickly be able to see who is genuinely interested in this - and can see through the sentimentalist bullcrap and get to the heart of the issue.  What is the heart of the issue. we're still not quite sure. but its based in two simple ideas that have created the necessity for this moment/movement. 1) there is a growing, global political movement, an avant-garde if it were, that ebbs and flows, but that does truly exist - that has begun to bring together all the singule-issue activists into something much stronger. A non-hierarchical network that believes another world is possible, dreamers and cynics, environmentalists and anarchists.  Design/art has left them behind in narcissistic ignorance. Sure we all made some anti-war posters, but that positions design simply as a functional tool. Where did the brave, simple, ideas go? look back to history, to the constructivists, dadaists and situationists. Designers all who strove for more and less - who fought, struggled and at times triumphed over language.  And then, of course, there is the personal. the personal is political, how can we see, feel, hear, that connection? if we can commit, seriously commit, to communication, to an ethical, moral even, form of communication between ourselves, between friends, lovers, and parents - perhaps we can see what needs to be done. In honest, dialogue and love.  soon, guys, soon....

      The basic idea is to materialise discussion around oppositional culture - nothing new, but I'm hoping I can do it in an interesting way.   Interesting, personally I'm more and more opposed to oppositional culture as a whole. Rebellion and resistance I think are part of the problem, not a solution. The rhetoric of course is still seductive though...   "opposed to oppositional culture" - that's great man! I suppose I agree with you somewhat, but it depends on how you define the terms. 'cause in my books, you're all opposition baby!   like I said I think we see the same problems. but the whole thing with revolution, resistance and class war is that its all still violence and war in the end. Ultimately its the same rhetoric that the neocons are using against Islam, us vs. them. I'm over that. There is no war to fight, other then ones we start. No one is our enemy unless we make them one... I'm out to fix problems, not fight them.   of course, of course. and well said. I don't think of oppositional approaches as inherently violent, though I do see your point on an ideological level. Nonetheless, there reaches a point when a "NO" is necessary in order to redirect dialogue, raise questions and challenge institutions. Don't get me wrong, I realise the absurdity and pure romanticism of what I'm trying to do here, but I also realise that if I don't do this while I'm in my twenties, I'll regret it in my thirties. "What better place than here, what better time than now...."   hell yeah! pretty much my philosophy too. these are the times for risk.

      It's come to my attention that my roughly hewn out manifesto below may come across as alienating. It was my intention to simply get all the thoughts that were in my head out. Though I am still confident in the principles behind what I am proposing I'm trying to find a better way to formulate them so that it can be more broadly accessible and engaging. But first I need to put my official proposal together, and then I will try and get back to it. Just so people know, the wheels are in motion. Give it another week.  At the bottom of all this, all I'm looking for is dialogue, let's talk. I now know that I need to look at more specific ways of engaging people. I've sent out a broad call for "rebel calls" or quotations as a starting point. Either send them my way, or post responses below.  Thanks.

      Four minutes to midnight is an idea, a 'zine, a network, a movement; a stupidly beautiful, lame, poetic gesture flung at the face of a stifling culture of neo-liberalism.   Four minutes to midnight is the moment when we begin to speak openly again, the moment when we realise time is running out, when we no longer allow cynicism and fear to silence our voice, when we sing, dance, yell, whisper, laugh and cry, when we commit to doing whatever we can to resuscitate dignity and hope in a culture that is geared to make us feel inadequate and insignificant. when we fight to win.  At the centre of this, we fundamentally commit to dialogue and communicative action, to the radical and transformative potential of communication.  From this central commitment, two basic principles emerge.   The first is a recognition and celebration of the existence and growth of an international oppositional culture. and a recognition of the necessity for cultural producers to do far more in engaging with, reflecting upon, and developing this culture. not only as voice-givers or tool-makers, but in directly contributing to the language of progressive resistance. Not to speak for, but to speak with.  The second principle is based in the recognition of the failure of the classical and modernist grand-narratives of the past. In reaction to this, we find the avant-garde position now resides in the development of micro-narratives, in the multitude of personal stories and journeys. Diversity is survival, and subjectivity is a critical weapon against hegemony. However this engagement with autonomous subjectivity categorically refuses to fall into the trap of relativism and its associated flattening of values.  In order to escape this trap, we endeavour to work in the space created by the interrelation of these two basic principles. To paraphrase the women's movement, "the personal is political." We see this space and our positioning within it as the starting point for genuine social dialogue and our assault on the industry of culture.  Furthermore, casting all sentimentalism aside, we call for a deep commitment to each other, to love in only its most honest dimensions, and from this, the belief that together, we can change the world.

      A big thank you to all those who have participated in our first round/issue and to those that have shown interest in the project. A .pdf of the first issue is now up in the  urlLink documents  section of the site and printed versions are on the way. Those that would like printed versions, please feel free to contact myself or  urlLink John , though as our budget is non-existant the 'official' print run will be quite small. In proper DIY fashion however, we encourage you to download the .pdf and print/distribute your own if you feel so inclined.  The first issue is a rather loose assemblage of materials, from quotes sent in and found, odd bits of writing that I've had kicking around and comments by participants responding to the question "what's wrong?" In editing and designing the first issue, DISSONANCE, John and I discovered some themes in all this material and tried to structure a loose thematic narrative with the content. Though we actively tried not to make them explicit (to maintain the open nature of dialogue), we hope that they might reveal themselves subtly and provide a way forward in this project. I won't deny my active role as the main editor/designer, and the expression of my voice and intentions behind the publication, but I do hope that those who have participated feel that they've made active contributions and will be encouraged to respond to how I've worked with their ideas and words. I apologise for the many responses that have been left out due to the necessity for concision and narrative, yet they have all helped to inform the development of the project and may be included in future issues.  I'm pleased by how people have reacted to this project so far and hope that with the release of the first issue, you'll be encouraged to participate even more. I realise that the lack of specificity of subject matter has perhaps been a bit of a barrier to really generating any dialogue, yet at the same time I think this open nature is essential to the philosophy behind the project. I will be making more specific posts for us to respond to, but I also hope that others will be encouraged to take the initiative and bring up what they think belongs to this project.  The question now is how to move forward. It is my intention to put out another issue in about three weeks time, before the end of august. I'd like to quite literally build on the first issue for this and I encourage people to go through the issue and react, in whatever way they find appropriate, to any of the content within it. Find something that engages you, a quote, an idea, a random line of text, a word even, and see if you can build on it. This could take the form of a written response, another quote, an illustration, a photograph, etc. The most important thing for me right now is for us not to censor ourselves, and to just find a way to express ourselves honestly, to try and build a dialogue around the things we care deeply about; love, joy, pain, politics, design, coffee, teddy bears, and especially the points where all these things converge.

      I'd like to open our conversation with a broad but important question. What's wrong? Take the question how you want it, but a gut-reaction would be preferable. Describe you're immediate physical surroundings, and try and answer the question honestly, from whatever perspective you want. Please also take the time to read other people's comments and build from them if possible.

       It has to start somewhere, It has to start somehow, What better place than here, what better time than now.  - Rage Against the Machine  Please post your quotations in the comments of this thread. I'm currently compiling the ones I've received by email and will post them here as well. In addition to posting quotations, please also respond to any of them that you might particularly like or hate.    Just a quick note about the intentions behind this. 1) Some may question the rhetorical nature of this approach, especially with these quotations taken out of context. Though I agree that this is a concern, I nonetheless believe in the necessity for poetic rhetoric, rhetoric can cause movement, and movement creates change. 2) By gathering these together from diverse sources, I hope we can make evident the vibrant history and contemporary expressions of dissident culture. 3) Asking for quotes seems an easy and fun place to start!

      I'm "officially" starting this project as of today. Many thanks to all those who have shown interest and kept me from turning my thesis project into another piece of pretty but pointless design. So the question is, how do we start?  For those that don't want to go through the (albeit short) length of my proposal, what I'm hoping we can do here is engage in a dialogue about our personal experiences of oppositional culture, and then materialise it. Now the question has come up many times, what is oppositional culture? I have no simple answers, though a good overview might be the book  urlLink We Are Everywhere . However, more relevantly, I think what I'm really talking about here is simply the gathering of little moments when we say to ourselves "no, this is not how the world should be..." But equally, the moments of ecstacy when we realise the freedom we have, when we feel the fragile beauty of the world, and when we then make the commitment to making sure these moments won't be taken away from us and others.  So, the question remains, how do we start? Well, I've decided upon a fluid plan of action that is open to modification and discussion. First, I've sent out a call for "rebel calls" and have been compiling them. I'd like people to take the time to try and come up with a couple more that really mean something to them and either post them in the thread above or  urlLink email  them to me. Within the next two weeks I will compile the quotes, along with some other texts, and put together our first issue of the 'zine. Which I will then send back out to you guys in search of responses, be they textual, visual, audio, etc.... I'll collect those responses and we'll do it all again.   I'll also be posting other dialogue topics on this site and would like to just encourage people to visit regularly and respond directly in a spirit of open communication. Let's see if we can build something here. Thanks

      My thesis proposal for this project can now be found in the documents section. For those that have been confused by what I'm trying to do here, it might help to have a quick look through it, though equally it may not. Don't let the structure/language scare you, you gotta do what you gotta do for school, but make no mistake, what we're doing here is trying to start a movement. Please post any comments, questions and criticisms below.

         I've had a lot to think about over the last few days on how to keep this project growing in interesting ways, how to get more people interested, how much direction to give, how to make sure I fulfill my MA requirements, and also technical issues of printing, binding and distributing. John is getting a good start in Montréal, hopefully you'll find some things popping up around there.  There's some great meta-level discussion of this project going on at the  urlLink Cranbrook Forum . If you're still confused as to what I'm trying to do here, the thread over there might help (or it might just confuse you more). I've made some lengthy posts and there has been some really good feedback so far. It is interesting for me to see the different types of conversation that are happening in different spaces and mediums.  I've decided to try and give a bit more thematic direction to the future issues while at the same time trying to maintain the open/collaborative nature of the project. I've outlined the themes in the cranbrook thread, and the next issue will focus on the concept of dialogue. This is obviously still a broad theme, and a theme that will run through the entirety of this project, but by specifically talking about dialogue now, I think we might be able to get some groundwork underway for the later issues. There are some good summary links on the subject of dialogue  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . What I was thinking is that people could make brief summaries of the discussions and ideas that have been tossed around here and elsewhere. This could take a loose form, but what I'm thinking, for those who would like more parameters, is either a copy/paste collage of things they've found interesting, short rants in reaction to the overall material, "poetic" interpretations or "academic" analysis.    urlLink This  is an interesting and quite simple example done for the  urlLink progress project  last year.  I know there hasn't been too much "meat" to our discussion so far, but I think interesting things are starting to happen on the  urlLink what's wrong  thread and John's recent  urlLink Illusion of Unity  thread as well as in the actual content of the first  urlLink issue . If we keep up these discussions while looking at the overall picture I think something valuable might come out of it. What I'm interested in here is seeing people's different interpretations of the content and purpose of these discussions and this project in general and then finding the relationship between them. If this all seems a little tedious, don't worry I'm not expecting anything in concrete form, just some open reactions.  For the more visual among us, I'm also interested in remixes/reactions to the first issue. I know it was type based, but I think the language was quite visual. These responses will run along with the "summaries" and some supplementary dialogue to form the content for the next issue which should come out by the end of the month.  Thanks for your participation thus far and if anyone wants a copy of the first issue, please let me know!

      This morning, sitting in my local cafe, reading The Revolution of Everyday Life by Raoul Vaneigem I was struck by the following passage ;    Love in its turn swells the illusion of unity. Most of the time it gets fucked up and miscarries. Its songs are crippled by fear of always returning to the same single note: whether there are two of us, or even ten, we will finish up alone as before. What drives us to despair is not the immensity of our own unsatisfied desires, but the moment when our newborn passion discovers its own emptiness. The insatiable desire to fall in love with so many pretty girls is born in anguish and the fear of loving: we are so afraid of never escaping from meetings with objects. The dawn when lovers leave each other's arms is the same dawn that breaks on the execution of revolutionaries without a revolution. Isolation a deux cannot confront the effect of general isolation. Pleasure is broken off prematurely and lovers find themselves naked in the world, their actions suddenly ridiculous and pointless. No love is possible in an unhappy world.
