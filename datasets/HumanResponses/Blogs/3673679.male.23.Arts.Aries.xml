       "Are you Attila?"  I must admit, I'm a bit taken aback when a 40-something, somewhat frumpy-assed woman in grey tights asks me this. Occasionally I'll see this one at the gym where I workout and exchange smiles with her, as friendly but familiar strangers often do. Today, however, this particular one had just finished her workout, and it seemed I was going to get nothing less than an offbeat history lesson. Or something.  To that effect, I never thought I'd catch myself staring at a 40-something, somewhat frumpy-assed woman in grey tights at the gym. At the end of my workout, however, that's exactly what I was doing. 'Are you Attila... ?'  I stalled. "What?"  "Are you Attila?" she repeated in true pull-string doll fashion.  She wasn't smiling. This must be serious. I took in her softly-lined face, her disturbingly blue eyes, the creases where, no doubt, curious dimples must live when she smiles, her hideously pink lipstick. She's attractive, I tell myself, but that thought encounters some difficulty making it's way from reason to fact. I stare some more. Perhaps after a few dozen cases of beer.  Am I Attila? Like, Attila the Hun, historical Mongolian conquerer? Or was this some godly man she met in here before, and has now *mistakenly* mistaken for me? (I don't know about others, but I certainly can't imagine any man named "Attila" as anything less than deified, in every sense of the word.) For a moment, I let my ego revel in the possibility of being mistaken for someone who is undoubtedly nothing less than a solid statue of masculine physique, but those horrible, neon-pink lips remind me that the inquiring individual is a 40-something, somewhat frumpy-assed woman in grey tights at the gym. MY gym. A stern, demanding look falls over her face--or was it there all along?--and the right side of my brain represses the smile from my mouth: I think she really wants to know if I'm Attila, and I think she wants to know now.  "Ummm... no." My answer comes out more like a question, and I immediately wonder if it will either embolden her to probe further or cement her belief that I am, at heart, a real wuss.  "Oh," she says. Strangely enough, she doesn't seem disappointed. "I met a guy in here once named Attila, and he looks a lot like you." What? And the entire TIME you were just wondering if I was this Attila guy? Up to this point, I had almost completed rendering a fully interactive, three-dimensional concept model of Mr. Attila in my head. Now, suddenly, I look like him. Perhaps this thought should have crossed my mind during the whole, "Are you Attila?" part.   Did she just smile? I'm desperate to see where this is going.  I return the smile. "Uh, ha!... no, sorry."  She's turning away before I even finish the sentence. "No need to be sorry," she says behind her, signifying that not only is the conversation over, but that I am indeed a flirt-less dweeb.  Things like this happen to me more often than I'd like. A couple weeks ago I went to a bar affectionately referred to as "The Smoking Bar" with a couple friends. As you can probably guess, right off the bat I'm less-than-enthused, so imagine my unbridled joy when a 243 pound woman in boots, ripped jeans, and a black Tasmanian Devil t-shirt from 18 summers ago asks me what I'm "doing here." Clearly six or seven beers in to her night at 8:30 or so, she literally leers at me. I breathe a contemptuous inner-sigh: drunk people never have any respect for personal space.  "Me? I'm just standing here!" What a dork. At times like this, I thank God that I'm not very witty.  "You're just standing there, are you?" Her half-open eyes look me over, but I don't need to hear the next thing she says to know what she's thinking. My testicles shrivel into my abdomen.  "How old are you?" she drawls. Her eyes are persistent in their probing--my torso feels like an examination table.  "Twenty-six," I tell her, and wonder why I'm lying. I suppose I don't want to seem the fragile 22 that I am; I'm afraid that such a vulnerable, boyish age will only encourage a woman with such intentions to "christen" me, or something far worse. As her eyes move back up from the faded, baggy crotch of my jeans, she meets my eyes.  "Twenty-six," she repeats, looking me over once more. My penis cowers in fear. "I'm going to go to the bathroom," she informs me, and smiles at me as she lumbers away. She turns from me just in time to avoid colliding with a wall, but I find myself wishing that she'd kept her eyes on me one second longer.  My friends shoot me a look. I shoot them one back, and our understanding is mutual. We're gone four seconds later.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take from experiences such as these. Perhaps a heightened awareness of my appeal to older women? If this was the movies, I'd be the protagonist the males in the audience love to hate. Perhaps I should be less flirtatious in my appearance? My wardrobe is nothing suggestive; aside from the occasional muscle shirt, I shoot for style with decency. I certainly don't mean to return the suggestion with these women--I'm an old-fashioned fellow, who likes to get to know his sexual partners as people first, among other values such as age, lifestyle, and diet.  But these are small things. Especially when I look like Attila.

       I smiled at her out of the corner of my eye, a sheepish, cowardly, last-minute attempt to garner some sort of self-verification out of it, then I was gone.  I pushed my shopping cart into the teeming parking lot, only half-paying attention to where I was going: I was still somewhat entranced by her taut, tan skin, the way her nipples made a triumphant stand against her tight, beige sweatshirt as she stretched in line next to me.  "That's a lot of soda," was what I wanted to say as she stacked three half-dozen cases of Diet Coke and one Dr. Pepper on the checkout belt. Instead, I meticulously self-monitored myself, taking pains to appear confident, non-chalant, but also cute, charming, endearing, and genuine. Really, it was the least I could do.  She had even giggled to me a little as she stacked her soda--no doubt a tease, an invitation to converse, flirt. But I played it safe, opting instead to agaonize later, alone, over whether or not I she had given me any second thought after I abandoned the checkout line.  I pushed my shopping cart onward. "Oh well," I consoled myself. "She had horrible teeth, anyway."

       Ah, Veto.* You frazzled little fat man. Thanks for calling me back.  I just had a meeting with Veto C***********, manager to several established and recognizable actors, and, to say the least, he seemed a bit frazzled. Maybe it's that short, fat, Italian men are always frazzled, or maybe it's that he wants nothing to do with no-name talents that ride on his star clients' coattails. Regardless, I refuse to go down without a fight. It took me two months to get this appointment, and I'm not going to be deterred by frazzled curtness.  "Trevor?" He's about four-foot-eleven, and pokes his pudgy head around the corner for the sixth time in three minutes.  "Yeah!" I'm too anxious. I've just been flirting with Bernardo,* the receptionist, while waiting, but only because flamboyant individuals like him always view casual conversation with other men as a pick-up. Unfortunately, I know this from experience.  I follow an shuffling, erratic Vince down the narrow, short hallway to his office, and decide that he was a penguin in his former life.  "Have a seat right there." He points to the chair directly in front of his desk. Then, he leaves. I wait. He's still gone. I check my watch. After a couple of minutes, I start to wonder if this is all a cruel joke. But he comes back in, shuts the door, and sits down at his desk opposite me. "What can I do for you?" he politely blusters.  Right to the point. I can dig that. "Well, Vince, if you want to get right to the point, I want to be a project for you." Yeah. He's not happy about this. He's wondering which one of his idiot assistants gave this punk-ass no-name an appointment.  "Okay." His eyes shift out of focus, and a furrowed brow creeps onto his forehead. He huffs. I think he wants coffee. "Have you done monologues for us?"  "Yeah, I went to New York and did some for Tobey--"  "But you haven't done any for us?" Interruption. Good. A large coffee.  "No, not yet."  "And you're living out here now?"  "Yeah."  "Okay, well let's get you in here to do some monologues, probably Thursday, Friday, or Monday, you'll call Carey tomorrow and set something up." I will? This guy wastes no time. It's only been thirty seconds. I make a second attempt at being memorable.  "Okay, well, I have monologues prepared--"  "Yeah, but I'm not set up for that today, and we'll need someone else in here, so let's set something up for later this week." With this, he gets up, goes to the door, and as I'm following him out I make a last ditch effort. I pull out my demo-DVD. He does a double-take over his shoulder. For a moment, he stops thinking about his coffee. "What's that?"  "This is just a picture-resume I put on a DVD, something that'll give you a better and more in-depth look at my experience and potential and whatnot."  His eyebrows contort in a decidedly bothersome way. "Okay, leave it on the desk."   I would have happily left it on his desk if he hadn't just then snatched it from me and put it there himself. His desk is cluttered, and he puts it under a few pictures of a very cute girl that was in here before me. I remember seeing her on my way in... she was very happy and charismatic, but in a way that reeks of bullshit. She had horrible shoes, too.  Vince is now behind me at this desk, and breathing like a bull in heat. Awkwardly, I lead the way out of his office, holding the door open for him. He stops behind me, pokes his head into an office where Carey is sitting at a computer, and tells her that I'll be calling tomorrow to set up an appointment to do some monologues. With that, he turns to me, says, "Okay, tomorrow," then speed-waddles back into his office.  At this point I'm pretty sure I feel dejected. I turn around to the shiny-happy face of Bernardo, and can think of nothing else to do but admit my defeat by reporting the obvious: "That was fast," I tell him, throwing in an uncomfortable laugh for good measure.  "Yeah, it really was," he tells me.   I decide that I don't like him very much, either. ____________________  *Names have been changed to protect the (somewhat) innocent.
