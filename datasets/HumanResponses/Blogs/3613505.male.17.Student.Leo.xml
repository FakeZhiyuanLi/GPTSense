      --- hehe well i think we should just skip over what has happened in the past week or so hehe i never got around to writing more stuff in here out of constant tiredness..... yeah... i've  been THAT busy okay so i met this girl a while ago and we got to talking... she lives in Victoria so that was kind of a bummer bc well you know if you wanna start something you really can't because long distance relationships never work-- well she said she was coming over for the weekend and asked if i wanted to hang out with her and i was all yeah for sure. so she's all okay and umm she can drive so she came to pick me up in this Escalade(haha i checked it out) and i was like whoa pretty nice there... and we drove around for a while...   THURSDAY   yeah lets start off on thursday - k she came to pick me up in the nicest car ever and we drove down to Jericho Beach, talked a bit - got to know each other a bit more found out what music she likes - turns out she loves all those animated movies like Finding Nemo... Monsters Inc. and such. It was really sweet - then I told her you know are you getting hungry so she said yeah - where should we go, so then we debated over it i kept insisting that she choose but she wouldnt so i said.. well... theres this really nice greek place on 4th (SYMPATICO) so  i told her yeah its good food and you'll really like it - so we went in sat down and talked about everything and nothing all at once - she has the most beautiful eyes ever - theyre green but they have light brown rings around the irises. Well after that we drove around downtown agan wondering what we should do and I told her ... well... we might as well go for coffee before we go back to the hotel room so we drove aroound and around looking for a Starbucks with enough parking (hehe its not exactly that easy with such a big vehicle) so we finally found it and I decide to have a cappuccino and she has a latte and we giggle around some more.... then we drive over to Stanley Park to drink our coffee and she tells me more about the story of her life and how her parents don't really like her and how they express it so bluntly -- it was kind of a bonding moment... then we headed back to the Four Seasons where she was staying, got a couple of beers from the mini fridge and sat down on the bed to watch some quality tv :-p  haha riiiiight  so we end up having a pretty cool makeout session but I stop it there - i know what youre thinking.....  no you didn't ... but, alas, I did. haha and umm yeah we had a really sweet good night kiss and I went on my way.   FRIDAY   The next day she picked me up again (it's easier that way.. shes the one with the vehicle) and we headed over to the Fairmont at the airport where she would be staying that night to check in. AFter checking in we went into the room to put her stuff away and uhh... freshen up :p haha okay it turned into a pretty long makeout session again but it was all very cool... haha it lasted for a couple of hours i think... anyways we got hungry so we headed over to a Japanese place she knows pretty well (apparently) and we had the all you can eat deal... and umm yeah that was fun there was a certain 'BET' that I will not go into right now hehehe oh i think i'll remember that anyways i had a really great time trying to eat with chopsticks and which my shaky hands made almost impossible - she actually asked for some cutlery for me.. argh... too embarrassing ... well she was a doll.. and i was a sweetheart :-) haha so then we decided to head over to the movies in Tinseltown to watch White Chicks because she had been on the set for a few of the takes and it was an overall funny movie. We held hands the whole time. and wow... the sexual tension just rose.... and rose....and rose. So by the time it was finished it was around minuit je pense.. but we ended up back in the hotel room hehe where umm... yeah... we had fun and such. I didn't get home until about 4 am and my dad came running down the stairs all freaked out hehehe very funny. I had a really great time.   SATURDAY   It was Saturday that she had to head back to victoria so we went out for a sort of Brunch I guess at Sophies Cosmic Cafe - I had a bowl of fruit and she had some big breakfast platter thing - we talked about our childhood and stuff (she went to a very strict catholic school run by nuns and priests) and we also discussed out disagreements with religion... blah blah blah.. all fascinating things actually... there i learned she wasn't exactly an artistic person at all which is fine with me because i guess I balance her off :) after that we went to stanley park again and we umm made use of the size of tthe Escalade  hahahahahaha  i love how witty and subtle i am. anyways we had a great time - then we had a frap and again she had a latte which really bamboozles me because it was sooooo hot that day - we went over to english bay and sat on a bench... watched people walk around ... got a little burnt by the sun and decided it was time to head back to the car. We picked up some blueberries from some grocery store and we said adieu -- then i went my way.... she went her's and  i didnt hear from her until later on that night near midnight when i got back from a basketball game with my homeboys haha yeah i'm ghetto i know... and we talked for a bit over the phone and then she had to go so we promised to see each other again. aww.. i really like her.. maybe this will be a start to something beyoooteeefool -- hope so.   SUNDAY   Nothing much happened sunday - woke up at around 5 because i'm a lazy bum and went over to school to supposedly play some basketball - turns out they were playing under the searing sun so i told them i was out of there - too much heat for me. they stopped too because they saw the stupidity of playing outside - saw christian at the bus stop.. argh that kid needs to live a little... hes stuck on joining the reserves and whatnot and hes trying so hard to lose weight but then hes just starving himself and its hurting him way more than it's helping - apparently he's passing out and stuff because he doesn't eat... blah... the boy needs help.. anyhoo after chatting with him for a while i headed over to hugh's for a bit - hung out - then headed over to the mcDonald's by the nightmarket to visit emily hah poor child has to work in the worst place ever. we couldn't even get into the nightmarket.. something must've happened and yeah so then we hung out some more at the McD's and then walked Emily home.... then I went home.. watched this really stupid movie called 'May'... read up more on my super long book.. 'Black House' and passed out   TODAY (MONDAY)   noooow that i have all of you caught up on the most significant recent events i must go shower or something.. clean up this giant mess and get my afro cut or something.. hair's driving me nuts. anyhoo i'll write in later today and update you all on my LIFE haha alright? yay... see you in a biiit!

I ALWAYS do... then again i get intimidated by hotness hahaha no i dont - thing is i don't see this working out but i do want at least a couple of hot makeout sessions..... lol   wow can you tell im a teenager -- haha wait but no no some older people can be such horndogs - other day this one individual.... i wont name names (MT) wanted to *censored* haha and yeah that was great lol ---  SCANDALOUS  hehehe wow i sound so dirty but nothing happened - i gave this person a weird look and got out of there...  hah so funny how you can have complete conversations with your eyes... they're just so expressive... well mine are anyways... i was in a coffee shop the other day and this girl was sitting at a table in front of me... me. reading a book. her.staring off into space... THEN our eyes meet and i wanted to see how long i could hold her gaze- haha we held it for a few seconds and she looked down - hahaha i kept staring and she kept looking up so i couldn't stop grinning.. hahaha mustve creeped her out i thought so i kept reading.. then i spaced out and looked out the window and saw the coolest dog... and i pointd to it with my eyes... yes yes i did... and then i finally asked for her name and ive never seen her again haha - hopefully i'll meet up with her one of these days  wow i keep coming back to write in this -- its so incoherent how ive just started new ideas and such... bah.. there's always a critic... including me.. yeah i dont like the way i write a lot of the time but people seem to enjoy it... well.....  my formal writing anyways - for instance - i wrote this editorial about how the chinese gov't was calling the dalai lama a Quebec Separatist... and i mean the editorial wasn't bad but i couldve done it so much better..... BUT my teacher couldn't stop talking about it... embarrassing... meh it's all good..  i dont think i'll ever see her again... hahaha ill mention reasons later i shouldnt badmouth her - shes a nice lady  hmmm - i have officially killed 20 minutes - only ten more to go before my sexy date calls - oh la la - eww thing is this individual doesnt really have much of a personality so im being very shallow here but i havent had a date in the LONGEST time it's ridiculous ahha so these are just my own mortal, human instincts wanting some contact.  oh la la i am quite the socialite - drinking monday night, movies wednesday night, house party friday night, haha somewhere in between i have my last few exams- hehehe wheee next week will be pretty coolio joolio  well it is nearly 9 and im on the phone with another amigo - i dont wanna stop talking- haha we somehow ended up talking about our future careers as carnies (hahahahaha we both got interviews at the PNE) :p we're so cool  mmmmmmmmmm pizza just got here - oh man - order the hawaiian pig from the flying wedge its so so so so so good - i love it.  mmm well gonna go fight for my piece of this delicious-looking pizza-pie.

      Well hello to all the world - or you know... you cool people fortunate enough to be reading this. This is a log of my everyday life with social commentary slipped in. I'm a rather refreshingly witty individual and am under appreaciated -- hehe no really i'm serious. Tonight I am in a moody mood because i got stood up - yes - yours truly got stood up ... grr the nerve. It really sucks too you know because i was kinda looking forward to this for a while. We met through a mutual friend but we only talked online and over the phone a couple of times. Then today I was pretty hyped because you know we were gonna finally meet and WAM-BAM... stood up...  i called a couple of times but..... no answer. People are so very indecent these days, youd think someone would have the courtesy to CALL or i dunno make smoke signals or something.. fuck.. eww no i'm actually not angry just disappointed.  Ahh.. i bet this is just karma doing its thing. see.. a couple of weeks ago i went out with my lady friend and we were just hanging out doing whatever it is cool peoplelike us do on saturday nights.. haha ... so we ended up drinking a full bottle of wine... ahaha okay  I  ended up drinking most of the wine but w.e we were both pretty messed up... oh yah this happens when we leave her place to 'go to starbucks for some coffee' haha so we get back to her place all messed up... stumbling through her front doors waking up the whole neighbourhood (oh yah we bought pastries too...mmmmm) haha and we somehow keep straighfaces about the whole thing... even tho i can barely walk straight..... anyways there is OBVIOUS sexual tension between the both of us but neither one of us decide to act on it so w.e we're there watching some movie and then the next thing i know..... it's over haha it was really trippy... so by now it's like 1am and im all... 'uh oh... buses are about to stop running' so i go for the door and she pulls me back by the arm and plants a big wet one on me... haha i was so shocked i actually kissed her back and kinda grazed her arm - anyways she got shy and whatnot and she pretty much pushed me out the door -- haha so now you got me.... drunk and dazed about what just happened and i stumble my way to the bus stop.... im actually surprised i made it home...  well thats not the end of things...... yours truly is a bastard and for that i am sorry - i never called her back or did anything - we saw each other once more but i just wanted to get out of there.. it was like... you want me...... but im not attracted to you which is saad becaue she was such a close friend of mine.... well... she is..... just..... i havent talked to her in like a month.... hah shut up okay... i have problems with committment i think... was just talking about that with this good friend of mine and i decided that i'll only get involved in a relationship that i know right from the start isn't gonna work out... why do i do it? beats me... hmmm maybe it's some kind of genetical thing... blah.. who knows anyhoo maybe thats why i got stood up  it still sucks...  omg omg okay this morning i wrote my physics final and i am sooooooo happy... i actually got EVERYTHING -- haha it sounds so nerdy but you have no idea how much this physics teacher has suffered to try to get us stupid cretins to learn a few basic concepts and i got them all ( i think ) it was great -- only i was freeeeeeezing in that exam room.... hah the goosebumps were so noticeable this one guy started laughing at me... cha.. but thankfully thats over - after that i went over to the gym where i found out how weak i really am - i can't do ANYTHING... well thats a lie... i can do pretty much everything just really badly hehehe  well after that i bused home and who do i see on the bus - this girl i met a few months ago we just started chatting randomly on the bus and now were homies haha yeah im cool like that -- i was really happy to see her for some reason and its weird because i barely know her   and yeah then i got here and watched this crazy movie about a deprived lesbian hooker who goes out to kill all her clients it's called MONSTER and it's pretty good - during the movie a couple of my sister's friends came over and the dog was raping one of them... gawd hes such an embarrassment..i think i'll put him in obedience classes or something -- meh... then again hes the bestest little dog ever and so then  i raided the fridge and left for my 'hot date' - :*( haha serves me right... no no  it sucks ot be me right now...... ack and now im just tired and annoyed at all the studying im gonna have to do this weekend for that retarded bio final... eww -- i hate this  well i'll keep you posted on the ongoings of my very eventful life  OH YAH TOMORROW IS MY JOB INTERVIEW!!

      hehehe well not much has happened to me lately - been on a job hunt for a loooong looooong time and um yeah so enough of that its really annoying noone will hire me even though i really think i have potential -- well poo on them noone cares about the loveless people in the world  hehe MORE people care about the cool polar bears we have around... such as Mr. Nolan Conrad... haha he is sooooo AWESOME... haha i would definitely do him... haha  hes not only a sexy beast but hes a fellow intellectual as well.. haha here is his column which btw is from this great website called 665:  -----------------------------   ENVIRONMENT NEWS   by NOLAN CONRAD, gay polar bear   You know, I get a lot of grief in my day to day existence for a lot of reasons; sure, I'm a little overweight, and yes, I am in fact a polar bear that is gay. But if there's one thing I do know, it's that our planet is under attack from all sides, and sadly, it's an easy thing to miss. I for one aim to assist in the opening of the collective eyes of America, and perhaps the world. And that, you see, is the purpose of this column. News that matters, brought to you through the unflinching eyes of a polar bear who likes other polar bears that are the same sex as he is.   ITEM - So it looks like California has asked president Bush to provide it the same protection from offshore oil spills he has afforded Florida in recent times. Well, you'll pardon me if I'm a little skeptical, but to me, this whole thing stinks of stunt on the part of our little White House squatter. Perhaps he thinks that a few offshore leases here and there will make the country forget what a ruinously bad environmental track record the man has. Mister Bush, here is one homosexual Ursus maritimus who will never forget the oil bigwigs who've got your presidency in their back pocket.  ITEM - James Slattery of Minnesota has been fined $1,800US after his reckless snowmobile driving took the life of 20 Canadian geese and 14 mallards. I'm sure some will think this is an exorbitant fee to pay for simply killing some of our precious wildlife, but I for one applaud the decision. Hats off to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, whose investigation led to the swift delivery of justice. Incidentally, my hat goes perfectly with my outfit.  ITEM - The Environmental Protection Agency has released findings which show that simple exposure to air pollution presents a cancer risk as much as ten times greater than any deemed acceptable by Federal law. Well, perhaps now all those big companies will be forced to own up to the damage they have been constantly and recklessly inflicting on our precious natural resources and to the human race itself. "These findings are a wake up call that EPA should take action to reduce this long overlooked public health threat," says Emily Figdor, the clean air advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Well put, Emily. By the way, if Emily were male and ideally a polar bear, I might perhaps want to engage in sexual intercourse with her. But since she isn't, I don't.  ITEM - I will be in the Vancouver area the weekend of June 22 to give a speech at the Clearbrook Library sponsored by University of Phoenix Vancouver. The topic of the speech will be "Endangered Species: Are We Doing Enough?" Doors are at 6:30 and the presentation starts at 7, followed by a question-and-answer session. It's my hope that we'll all benefit from an open dialogue between like-minded individuals. After the Q&A, I will probably go cruising for a few twinks who are into boots. Hoping to organize a piss party; contact me through the usual routes if you know anybody or if you yourself might be interested in getting crazy with a room full of piss-soaked faggots, at least one of whom (me) will be a polar bear. Boots a plus. I am HIV-, you be too. We're hoping to avoid another of those bullshit parties where there are way more tops than bottoms; please plan accordingly (this is not to say that there won't be a little pig-in-the-middle planned, however).  ITEM - The state of North Carolina has come under fire - and in fact legal action - from the states of Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia, and the Southeast Compact Commission for Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management for its opposition to a planned radioactive waste dump which would be placed in its own borders. The lawsuit is over an agreement North Carolina made in the past which the other states feel it is failing to honor. Well, if you ask me, the only thing North Carolina is guilty of is failing to mollycoddle these NIMBY-crying losers. IF they want a place to dump pollutants, then perhaps they should look into their own land - or perhaps they realize what a bad idea this dump would be and don't want to shoulder the responsibility for it. They ought to be ashamed, and I hope the courts see it the same way.  ITEM - In case you had somehow forgotten, I am a polar bear, indigenous to the Arctic, that prefers the romantic and sexual company of males (and I myself am male). I also prefer penises in my anus and mouth and hands and in one very bizarre yet still satisfactory encounter, armpit. It occurs to me that I should probably go back and point out in the previous item that North Carolina is a lovely state with a pleasant atmosphere, friendly people, and an absolutely stunning gloryhole scene. Oh well.  ITEM - And finally, closing out the column with a little good news: According to the World Wildlife Fund, three of the top ten whale-watching spots in the world are located in none other than the United States of America. Just goes to show that while we still have a long way to go, the environmentally-conscious are indeed making a difference! Well done to all involved in the conservation effort. If we keep it up, the world will indeed hear our voice. Inspiring stuff. And for now, reader, I leave you with that thought. And remember: Think globally, act locally. God bless.   NOLAN CONRAD is an internationally-known voice for environmental concerns. His column, "Environment News," appears in over a thousand papers nationwide. Mr. Conrad currently lives in Alaska and is totally into boots and gulping down gallons of hot steamy golden piss.

      okay so i havent written in a while and thats mostly because nothing much has happened ummm k i havent heard from Kate in a while - it was starting to annoy me that she called me like every night but now i kinda miss it aww you say but the thing is i dont know if i really like her because of ceratin reasons... one might recall a certain three and five haha i love this code that only i and a certain other person who shall never ever read this journal thingy know about ... hmm kinda saddens me but the thing is i really dont like her (Harley) -- see i met her a long time ago it was like around october i think and umm we became really good friends.. started hanging out with her more and more and more- got to know her friends too... we got along just fine too and everything was cool... thing was she wanted me but quite frankly i think she is pretty ugly and her personality doesnt really attract me either.. everything is about how she suffers about being discriminated against.... its really stupid because... Harley.... NO ONE CARES... w.e anyways she stayed overf a couple of nights and i think it was like her way of trying to get with me... luckily nothing happened but i really really have no feelings for her--- shes just so... ugh.. gross. I dunno.. shes kinda tall and really skinny... she smells kinda funky... her feet are all callousy and her hands are really gross too.. she does so much stuff to her face that she has uglified it... hmm it kinds hurts to talk about her like this but its just so true -- i really dont like her. shes off to New Brunswick for a while .. family trip or something. and she thinks shes hot shit... she talks about her future as if only her decisions matter or have any sort of importance... every time i tell her that you knw i look forward to mcgill and being in university and whatnot she comes back at me with this stupid smirk and says.... well. you know.... youre the type of person who wont succeed in university... like what the fuck... i thought we were friends here and i was all.. he just because youre gonna get stuck in BCIT (not that its bad at all -- i just wanna go to uni) you dont have to take out your stupid regrets out on me... you screwed up academically and your love life sucks.. she goes out with these retarded people that only want to get with me haha its soo sad but w.e i really  dont mind her otherwise. she showed me her sketchbook the other night... talking about her 'technique' and all this bullshit she doesn't have... well its actually kind of saddening... she thinks shes this really great artist but her paintings and work have no feeling at all - theyre all pretty much crap... i dont have the heart to tell her because she tries to damned hard... i just wanna like pull her back and say - hey you know what.. your art sucks... it has no depth.. value.... or feeling at all. everything looks so 2dimensional yet she brags about how its so so great and no... it's not. Every time i talk to her about my achievements she pushed me down shes like oh well you know you only got it because your school is so small... and i say fuck you -- you know what i dont need this crap... i think im a great person and ive grown really tired of you...your friends only hang out with you because they feel sorry for you - youre really just a sad loser... get over yourself... youre not that great -- yeesh and again i have to admit she is one person that i have confided in about everything about me.. she knows a lot about me but not the most important part of me which is reserved for only certain people... yeah... i almost told Gabe who is becoming a pretty good friend of mine...yaargh it just gets me so mad that Harley thinks she so fucking high and mighty... like oh yeah im painting the gazebo because SOOOOOOO many people are counting on me... no theyre not you retardyoure just a pompous, talentless bitch who wont get anywhere because you cant get over yourself.... i wish there was some good stuff i could say about her but no... everything is about her... everything she wants she has to get whenever it pleases her... ewww...well you know what... not anymore... you have really  ugly shoes too... haha that sounds so shallow but shes the cheapest person ever... she has money but she walks around in these messed up scraggly-ass shoes... argh... i have no idea why i hang out with her --- shes such a loser... yet... i dont know... somethings keeping us bound... but i hope the binding loosens soon. maybe after this trip to new brunswick she'll chill out a bit ---  AAANYHOO-- back to Kate..  yeah so i havent heard from her since... tuesday or wedneday i think and its starting to bother me - i think ill drop her a line maybe give her a call let her know im still interested in her...  oh today i had this long and deep discussion with my good buddy Gabe - shes the coolest girl ever but she gets involved in such crappy relationships... hmmm they guy she has been dating doesnt really appreciate her and i think its breaking her heart. i would seriously go out with her but she doesnt know --- haha i lead such a double life its not even funny... i think it might become a problem soon when people meet other people i know -- and argh... especially now with me being int he public eye because of certain achievements. haha its not so bad at all. but back to gabe - she really needed someone to tell her that she was really a great girl and i took this job upon myself because i really believe she is.... we talked about everything and nothing all at once and she told me how i am so very undefined... and i asked her..... well.. how so hmm.. you knoow what it'll be easier if you just read our convo... then again... no i dont think she would appreciate that --- nope i will just tell you the crude details that only pertain to myself - such as... okay i am scred of comitment. theres no other way to put it - i wont get involved with a girl because everytime i start to something inside me panics or something.. i swear i have no idea and i just go into a frenzy.. okay no maybe i dont go into a frenzy but i do break it off.. why? i dont know because im a n idiot i guess...there was this one girl whos name we shall not mention.... i got to know her pretty well but then she did the unthinkable.. she gave me a kiss that was to mark the begining of a more serious relationship ..... sooooo.... ive only spoken to her once more and it was kind of awkward. i dunno it was just weird and uncomfortable and i have no desire to see her again oi havent had any long deep talks with her because i have no idea what to be around her - haha and the thing is get this my friend abe has a friend who's cousin is this wonderful girl im talking about.... *sigh* ... if i wasn't such a coward i would call her up and ask her out on a date  yaaar...  then i remember that im broke and really cant afford to take anyone out.. not even myself out for some coffee or w.e.. hmmm this depresses me but i really have to get a job or else i will be doing absolutely nothing for the rest of the summer and that would be a very boring and tedious waste of time.... :-S hmmm i think i will go to all the strabucks in this city and bed and plead for a job... i will too... haha i need to get PAAAAAID and...... laid. haha yeah...anyhoo now i must go take a shower because i feel like a filthy pig - eww its like 7.30 at night.... and its not really night either its stills o light out.... hummm. well have a good one.. ill write late on tonight prolly...   ciao babes

GET A JOB AND LEARN TO LIVE FOR YOURSELF!!!    urlLink   What type of Loser are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.     urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS!
