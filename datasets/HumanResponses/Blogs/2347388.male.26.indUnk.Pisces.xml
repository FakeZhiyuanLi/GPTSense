      So I was in a gas station pisser the other day, when I looked at the wall and noticed that someone had taken the time to carve "Jesus loves you" into the wall.  My first thought was that it is nice to be loved, but then I wondered what kind of stance Jesus would have taken on vandalism.  I'm no theology scholar, but it seems to me that there must be something in those 15... oops, crash... 10 commandments about not carving into thy neighbors bathroom stall.  Does this bother anyone else, or just me?  Let me know.

      So I have come to the conclusion that today's songwriters have no real creativity.  I was listening to the radio today, and the band Staind came on.  Here we have a group of guys who will tell you that they are happy and well adjusted (Ive seen it in interviews) singing about not belonging and being all depressed and shit.  This new trend in suicide rock is all a giant load of bull.  If you insist on looking to songs to understand how most young Americans feel about themselves look to Weezer's "In the Garage" and "Undone- the Sweater Song."  They are all about kids finding a safe place to be themselves.      One more note.  If these new artists want to learn something about depression writing check out the Blind Melon album with the bee girl.  It's all about subversively depressing people with a happy beat.      If anyone out there agrees, or disagrees let me know.  My mind is an open forum of Ideas.

      So I was in the same bathroom as mentioned in the first posting, and noticed that someone had creatively edited the grafiti that said "the Lord is strong here" into saying "the ODOR is strong here."  Now I'm sure that God hates destruction of property, but he also must enjoy honesty. Speaking of honesty, for those of  you that Tony hasn't already told, I compromised my code of ethics the other day outside of Paul Brown Stadium.  There was a bum holding a sign that read "help the homeless.... why lie, I want beer."  So I went back and gave him a dollar.  But the key moment came as my dollar floated into his bucket, he said to me, "the truth shall set you free."  Classic.

      Yeah tony, I've got your link envy right here.  The only link envy Tony has is a link of Keilbasa.  He would either like it down his pants, or his throat. Wow that sounded bitter. So anyway, for my fans who go straight to my link try to remember that Tony's birthday is coming up next Saturday, so jump on over to his site (the one you pass through to get to me) and wish him a Happy birthday.  There, now he won't have to diginto the depths of self-promotion. Oh yeah, saw more God-fiti the other day.  For you new folks that is religious graffiti.  Apparently Jesus still loves me while I'm peeing.  Kind of makes me all warm and fuzzy on the inside.

      Okay, so here's my question...   Why am I not on the list of people who have met Tony?  It seems to me that the person who had to share a house with him growing up should get a little more of a mention than just my little side-bar that no one even reads.  If you are tired of Tony's little brother being neglected, tell him.  Today begins the official "Get Greg on the list" campaign.  Have you ever noticed that "campaign" reminds you of "champagne"  mmmm...Champagne.  No? must just be me.

      Well, My Godson has arrived.  His name is jackson Clymer Ewing, and he came into the world on Feb. 5th 2004.  That makes me officially "The Godfather."  F-ing A that is so cool.   Now we must focus on my unborn spawn.  We have a few favorite names picked out, but I am curious what you all think.  If anyone actually reads this crap, please comment on any names that you think would fit.  Keep in mind that we are not finding out the gender until birth, so all MALE or female names are welcome.  Read into that last sentence anything you would like.

      Or else A-rod might be gone, and Georgie girl would be stuck using his fat contract to dry up the tears.  It's amazing how much hatred I have for A-rod (by the way, is that just his name or that thing he likes Jeter to shove up his.... nevermind) since he became a yankoff.  I never paid too much attention to him until then.  Maybe I'm just pissy because the MLBPA just bent over and took it from New York after making all of the other teams at least buy dinner.

      So, what exactly does that mean?  Ever since Tony started this site his photo gallery has said "coming eventually."  I think that it's time for Tony to get a little mtivated and put some pics out.  God knows that he has the time (I mean who watches "Charmed?"  The only thing TNT is good for is "Pensacola:Wings of Gold.")  Think Baywatch quality writing about Marine pilots.  Not as much eye candy, but it does have Sandra Hess.  I guess she's some sort of B-movie actress.  This is all I have seen her in, but... Very nice. We all also know that Tony has the pictures.  I mean, I get to C-bus maybe twice a year, but he certainly has enough drunken pictures of me to fill their own site.   Oh well, maybe it's just one of those things that are best unresolved.

      So after hearing about Pat Tillman's death I reflected my reaction to 9/11, and the emergence of a war with Iraq.  I remember thinking, "what should I do to make a difference?"  After 9/11 I considered joining the military, but used my future wife and family as a crutch to not feel as bad about not doing it.  Then the war with Iraq really hit home when my best friend's reserve unit got called to duty.  Again, I thought about enlisting, but I now had a wife, and the prospect of a new job on the horizon.  So I stayed home.   It makes me grateful to think of people like Mr. Tillman who have made great sacrifices, leaving family and careers behind, so that I have the freedom to live my life without fear.  All of these men and women deserve our undying gratitude for their commitment to perpetuating the freedoms that we all take for granted so often in our lives.  Thank you to any sevice person who may stumble onto my little posting.  Thank you for defending my rights.

      So, Tony was lamenting a few weeks ago that he couldn't make a perfect omelet.  Well, yesterday I acclomplished that exact feat. 3 eggs, mushrooms, ham, cheese, and green (yes, green) olives.  Perfect coloring perfect consistency on the eggs, perfect fold-over.  I was going to post a picture, but I didn't want to waste precious eating time.       Most of the rest of the day was spent either at a wedding, or drinking after said wedding.  So, congratulations to Jen and Chris.  The wedding and reception were both great times.

      Yes, I made a grammatical error in my last post.  Instead of "there is snow..." I wrote "Their is snow..."  I guess it is from hearing so many people replace saw with seen ("guess who I seen last night?")  and the copious amounts of double negatives.  Yes I was an english major, and I am usually better than that, but I focused more on literature, and I have been out of school for a few years anyway.

      So I wake up this mortning after yesterday being so nice outside and nothing much on my schedule.  I think to myself "I think I'll get in 9 holes today."  Then I go downstairs to put out my dog. (The coolest and smartest dog in the world, mind you.)  Their is snow on my deck, and it's friggin" cold.  It's enough to piss you off.

      So, evidently several of the employees of a large grocery store in Bowling Green, Ohio have differing opinions on the subject of religion, and have taken it upon themselves to wage war on using the wall of the men's room as a battlefield.  Evidently, Jesus not only loves me, but Oreos as well.  Jesus also saves by using his Kroger Plus card.  But most importantly, "Donkey's eat cheese."

      All I can say is that she is beautiful, and that her mother (my wife) came through like a champ.  Enjoy. This is my new daughter   Emma .

      I just want to do a little survey.&nbsp; Anyone who stumbles onto this site, pleasea leave some sort of comment.&nbsp; This will let me know how fruitful the 5 minutes I waste every week are.&nbsp; If I can entertain just one other sad, pathetic individual I'll be happy.

      6. Jack Black.  Great actor.  Huge partier I'm sure.  I think I've seen most of his work dating back to "Airborn."  Great movie about some surfer kid who moves to Cincinnati to live with relatives but gets tangled up with the school hockey team.  Black has a small but important role as Auggie the goalie.  5-4.  John Favreau and Vince Vaughn.  Not only for "Swingers."  I've never seen either of them in a bad movie (except maybe that remake of "Psycho.") Both are more smooth (or shmoove as I have begun saying recently) but I think I could hang.  3. Kid Rock.  He just doesn't give a f*ck.  I think it would turn into a 3 day bender before we were finished.  2. Snoop  Cause he's a mutha-f*cking hustla.  You better ask somebody.  I think I would come out of it very relaxed, but probably forget everything that ever happened to me before that point.  1. The Godfather of Funk, George Clinton.  Se above about memory, but I bet George would have the coolest stories, and there would be no hassle about anything.  I've only gotten within about 10 feet of the man, but he just gives of this aura of funky goodness.

      Sorry folks.  I haven't had time to post even on my vacation.  That's what happens with a 1 month old in the house.  Just dropped by to make 2 points:  1.  Abe FROMAN is the Sausage King of Chicago (El Reyo De Salchicho Chicago for my spanish speaking fans.) Not Abe Fromer.  2. Anyone hiring?

      I think that if Tony has yet to put a photo gallery on his site, he should remove the link to said gallery.  Any thoughts?
