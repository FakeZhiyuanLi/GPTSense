      Today is a bad day.  The weekends festivities are killing me.  God we had a good time though.  I am touched because someone confided in me, something huge, on Saturday night. He has a problem and needs help. This will be possibly be an emotionally charged one.  I wish I could say more... but even though noone reads this but me, or cares for that matter, I can't seem to. I am scared of someone 'figuring out its me'. Can you believe it. There's no way it could happen.  I have so much in my head today. Will try to take it easy and lay low.  Peace out

      Last night my friend R ran out of a dinner with the gals last night claiming 'she could not do this anymore.' Do what I wondered?? Then after calling her later it was that she can't pretend that everything is okay and hide how sad she is. Anorexia, relationship problems, family breakdown... lots of things have been her vice over the past few years.  She is such a warm, wonderful person but sometimes so hard to be around. Am I selfish for finding it hard? Maybe. But for years now I have been wanting her to bounce out of this 'down' period. She's always so down. I feel really sorry for her, I have no idea what depression is like, and people who don't have it, like anything, find it hard to understand. I guess I just think of times when I have been broken hearted for whatever reason and imagine that being a permanent feeling. That has to be rough. The thing is, she is really pretty, smart, funny, from a wealthy family. So she appears to have everything. But then.. how silly of me to assume that. I have known R since we were 10. We are now 23 and have ave been very close from the start. Since she was 18 she has been 'down'. I hope everyday that she realises how wonderful she is. I wish she would start to smile again and give life a chance. I wish I didn't find myself getting annoyed with her being so depressed. I hate hearing myself turn her emotional state into something about me... but sometimes I get so frustrated. Anyway... this is me, Dimensions, fighting my demons. I guess I'll now play another game of Tetris and hope that this sunny Friday afternoon goes quickly. Bring on Friday night Happy Hour!!

       You know what the sad thing about me is? This is my first blog ever and I have chosen to use the same font/colour/size that I use at work... in all my work related correspondance. Tomorrow I will change it- maybe it's time to live a little.   My name is Dimensions and I am a 23 year old girl living in Sydney, Australia. This morning a friend of mine emailed me a link to her personal blog. She had been keeping an anonymous yet deeply moving blog a secret to her friends, yet open to strangers.   I have learnt a few things today.   You cannot judge how people are feeling based on how you have felt in simialr situations. I had no idea my friend was depressed. Now that she has opened up and allowed two of us to see her previously anonymous blog... she has chosen to start a new anonymous one. I had a fleeting glimpse into my friend's inner thoughts and now this will be taken away unless I can search through the new blogs to find her again. Her creativity would be a dea giveaway, I'd find her new name etc, I think.    How can someone who I think has it all, find life so difficult. And when I say have it all, I don't mean the perfect life. She has lost her father and over recent years has gone nearly completely deaf. These are hard things to come to terms with, I can only imagine. But she is such a funny, smart, gorgeous, witty and charming person... I have always thought she had it all. She thinks the same about me which is funny. I played a part in her blog and she thought I had it all! Haha. Maybe noone has it all...   I feel honoured that I wa allowed to read her inner thoughts.   Which brings me to this new Dimensions blog.   I have a pretty good life, have had a few hiccups along the way but that is to be expected. I have a good family, great friends, a good job and a wonderous boyfriend. But I have so many thoughts inside my head and feelings that I do not like to share with friends or family because sometimes I feel I say too much, I think too much and I am too complex. I am just a girl I guess... and appearances aren't everything. I am so inspired by my friend that I will continue to write now too and share my thoughts with noone. This might just be the answer I have been looking for. What I could see by my friend is that whilst I thought she had it all, I was wrong. I don't have it all either. I think I'd do a lot better in life if I could share more thoughts and feelings. That's what my blog will be about. How many dimensions I have, and in turn, how many dimensions we all have.
