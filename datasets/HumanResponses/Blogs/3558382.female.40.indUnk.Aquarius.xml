      Since I will not be here for a few days, you could amuse yourself by making a comment or 2. This is supposed to be an interactive medium but I have only seen a few brave comments so far.  You can comment about the blog, my writing skills, the weather, or anything you like. Part of the purpose of this trip is for me to get ideas about what to do when I get back to Geneva. I have already received many suggestions and will probably write about them in here in the future. I keep writing the suggestions down in a special blue book with planets on the outside.  If you'd like to think about this for a bit and give me suggestions, you too are welcome to participate in this game by commenting in here (or, if you prefer to do it anonymously, you can send me an email).  Thank you very much in advance.

      For those of you who know me well, I am VERY allergic to horses. Therefore it wouldn't seem like a very good idea to go to a horse farm where they have 16 horses, 5 cats, and one dog. The amazing and unbelievable thing is that I haven't taken a single anti-allergy pill since I arrived here on Friday morning!  Susanne, aka Sushi, and I have known each other since we were 10. We used to be so much alike that my mother couldn't tell us apart from behind. We used to have the same clothes, sneakers, things, used to like the same colours, you name it. We realised that our fabulous connection still exists...we have the same blue mobile phone. Not only that, we have chosen the same ring tone as well. Susanne has her right ear pierced twice, just like me, and she is also wearing a glittery thing in the second hole, just like me. Fun fun fun. Today we bought the same kind of fleece jacket just like we used to do as kids.  Midsummernight's Eve rained away. It was pouring cats and dogs when I arrived on the train from Copenhagen. We agreed to stay in that evening instead of celebrating. And that was ok because we only wanted to chat and chat all evening. It was 4 years ago since I visited Susanne last, and then she was living in Wimbledon living a slightly different life. Since then she has made a dream of hers come true: Susanne bought Lynga horsefarm 18 months ago and rents out boxes to 16 horseowners. There are plenty of girls helping with the work on the farm, and Susanne's and Han's daughter, Samanta 9, gets to ride her pony Cello on a daily basis. Han is also happy living on the farm because it enables him to do things with his hands, which he enjoys (like building horse boxes, for example).  Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that I would be able to live on a horse farm with all my allergies. But I guess The Cleanse I went through has done me a LOT of good (if you haven't yet heard about The Cleanse I have done, I'll be more than willing to tell you).  My early departure from Edinburgh gave me a glimpse of the city from above on a nice sunny morning. I wish I could publish my pictures from there in here, but realise I have to learn the Picture Blog before being able to do that. I'll try to learn that later during my trip.  It is late and my train leaves at 8 in the morning. I'd better go and re-pack my bags. The coming week I will be with my aunt in her summer house. Hence, no computer or internet access until Thursday (at the earliest). Therefore, I wish you a good week and see you soon. (If you don't see anything from me by Friday, it means I will be busy at a friend's wedding until Monday 5th.)

      Today I finally had some Scotch Whisky. I visited The Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre. A couple of days ago I was approached in the street by someone who wanted to do a survey of tourists coming to Edinburgh. If I showed up at a hotel the following day and promised to participate in a focus group I was going to be given Â£40. Pretty good pay for an hour so I went. There were 8 of us, 3 Americans, 2 Canadians, 1 Lett, 1 Chinese, and me. We received the money immediately and then they served us coffee and tea. The focus group discussion was taped and basically the Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre wanted to know why we had not visited their attraction since it was right near the Castle. We all gave our reasons why and left forty pounds richer. We had a nice time actually, and were given brochures of the whisky centre which made us all decide to go there now that we knew about it.  Yesterday the weather was absolutely horrible. Windy and rainy and cold. At least today the rain didn't fall sideways... I went to Holyrood Palace yesterday, only to find out it was closed 23 June to 5 July. Next I went to an interactive exhibition called Dynamic Earth--only to find out they had closed at 15:15. Typical. I went to the hotel to wait for my 40 pounds instead. After the market research Margita and I had a really nice girls' dinner, just the 2 of us. We caught up and reminisced about old times ("yes, remember that one who, at 17, said he had always liked older women, and I was only 21!).  Today I finally got to both Dynamic Earth and the Whisky Centre. I really enjoyed getting to know how whisky is made and the distinctions between malt whisky and blended whisky. Whisky is the Gaelic word for 'water of life' in case you didn't know.  In the evening went with Margita to the children's weekly swimming lesson. Great fun. Freja is crazy in the water. She extra crazy today because of her birthday. She told every person she met: "I'm five today." Cute. I gave her a t-shirt (pink of course!) where it says: "I'm a wee angel".  Early tomorrow morning I take off for Copenhagen. From there I will hop on the train and cross over to Sweden to visit Susanne (aka Sushi), an old school friend who lives in Halmstad. Hopefully we will be able to celebrate midsummer in style, but the weather doesn't look that promising. Oh well, it's the being together that counts.  Ok friends, until the next time I get my hand on a keyboard.

      Holistic Quotient. This is the combination of IQ, BQ, EQ and SQ, where the letters I B E and S stand for intelligence, body, emotional and soul respectively. I love this interpretation of the human being and of humanity.  Susanna and Martin Ehdin are the Swedish authors who have written about this very interesting perspective in the book with the same title as this blog-entry (Original title: HQ - den manskliga helhetssynen). As far as I know, the book is yet to be published in English, but at least you can take a look at their websit www.ehdin.com for more information. Susanna is an MD in Immunology and Martin is a consultant who lectures at business forums.  I have been reading this book for the past month. It's less than 200 pages so it's not very long but there is a lot to think about in there. I have been re-reading many passages which resound with my thinking and values. Throughout my reading I have wished for this book to be translated into English so that I will be able share it with my friends. I even considered translating it myself in order to get it done. But by now I have checked out my namesake's website and realise that she will is probably in the process of getting it done already.  The book describes how you and I can create a better future for ourselves and our world by giving our HQ more prominence in our lives. We need to create a balance whereby we reduce our reliance on IQ, which is the dominant way of thinking in today's world, and giving more space to our kinestetic and spiritual abilities and senses.  The reading of this book gives me hope. I very much belive in its approach, particularly since it resonates with all the cleansing that I have been doing lately. The book talks about the intelligence of the heart and the body, the value of our own personality, our inner and outer environment. It presents a new view on health and integrated medicine, and then goes on to discuss wisdom, spirituality and identity. The tinal chapter pulls it all together by bringing HQ into our relationships, our workplace, into parenting, and into society. One important message is that we are all connected and what each and every one of us does had an effect somewhere else. Just imagine our hearts beating with the same frequency. What power!  For me, this book represents a holistic view for humanity. I highly recommend it.

      Today is Siri's birthday. We will celebrate with a mini-party this afternoon. She will have a big party on 3 July and is very much looking forward to it.  On Thursday we went to see Jesper perform on his recorder (blockflojt in Swedish). He played his solo by heart (he was the only one who did). There were 16 performers all in all. At the end 10 of them played a piece all together, which was very nice.  Friday I got the privilege of picking up the girls from school. We had to walk to Jesper's school to catch up with Margita and to watch Jesper during his sports day. Unfortunately it started raining and was pretty miserable so we had to go home and change before heading off. Once we were better equipped we set off on our walk. Freja, with slight exageration, said "I don't like this rain. This is the worstest day of my life!" Once we finally got to Jesper's school we had missed all the action. Jesper had received 8 first places and one second place so he was very pleased.  Friday evening Margita had her girlfriends over. They all went to pre-natal class together when they were expecting their now 8-year olds. And they still get together every 2 months for dinner at each other's houses. We had fun and chatted a lot. I had made falafel which turned out to be a very popular dish.  Saturday afternoon, after kid activities like Gymini and football, I took the 3 kids to see the new Harry Potter movie. Jesper and Siri had already seen it. My darling goddaughter Freja sat on my lap the whole movie through and was only scared twice. Good girl! She loves Harry Potter.  Saturday night Nick took Margita and I to the party of an Irish friend, who had just moved into a penthouse apartment down in the harbour. Wow, what a view of the city from there! We left when it was past midnight so we were pretty tired on Sunday after two late nights in a row of partying.  Today I will go into town for a while to have a look around.

      Monday was a great day. Margita and I started off with a breakfast at POSH with Nick. Then we went to change the battery of my Baume&Mercier which had died during the night. Next stop was Boots to get some suncream. I also bought a nail file which was a casualty in my suitcase during the first leg of my trip. Next stop was the mobile shop to check out a new mobile phone for Margita. She was in need of a free upgrade. She ended up getting a nice little light oyster handset from Siemens. By the time we had done all this it was still only ten o'clock.  The tourist bus took us around the city and down to the port during the next 2,5 hours. The guide we had was very funny and kept us amused and interested. It was very windy and cold out there on the roof of the double-decker bus, but it was the best place from which to see this beautiful city. The sandstone from which the majority of the buildings are made from were once upon a time dug up here in Craigleith, right next to where Nick and Margita live. We had lunch at a very quaint little cafe called Clarinda's. Clarinda was the muse and love interest of the writer Robert Burns and his grave is located just beside this little cafe in the Old Town. Margita had a nicer reason for going there, as she and Nick went there to celebrate each time after she had her scan to confirm her pregnancies.  Tuesday I had a nice time at home fiddling with my digital camera. I have signed up for an on-line course and I went through the first lesson, as well as the user guide for my camera. It was nice to have the time to do only this for as long as I wanted. The next lesson is tomorrow. In the evening on Tuesday we went to see Siri in her ballet class end-of-year show. She was the grandmother in Peter and The Wolf. Before her came the smaller girls, i.e. the snowflakes and the flowers. They were all very cute to watch. Thursday night it is Jesper's turn to perform on his flute.  Today was a very lazy day. I woke up at 10:30 which I haven't done since I was on holiday last summer. It was wonderful.  BTW, I forgot to tell you that the Swedish football star Henrik Larsson, who scored twice in the game against Bulgaria on Monday, he is a much loved local hero in Scotland. He has just spent the last 7 years playing for Celtic, one of the popular local teams. Hence, there are many scots wanting Sweden to win the Euro2004 in Portugal because their hero is on the Swedish team. As a curiosity, a Celtic's home game draws an audience of 60'000 people.... A bit different to poor Servette Football Club in Geneva.

      On Saturday I went for a lovely walk along the water of Leith, a small river running through a section of Edinburgh. In the evening the kids insisted that i watch Bruce Almighty on DVD with them before going to bed. During the whole movie Freja was cuddling up beside me. Every 10 minutes or so she turned around and stroked me on the cheek, just to make sure i was still there. Cute.    Bill, a Canadian friend of Nick and Margita, came over for leftovers (he is affectionately known as the Hoover from Vancouver!). He had brought a video of when his band played in a pub recently. Unfortunately we could never get the cable to work between the video camera and the TV so we ended up listening to the Amazing Greys instead. The Amazing Greys is my brother's band. I received a copy of their first CD with 8 songs just before I left on my trip. very good stuff! Bill and Nick were very impressed and loved the sound.    On Sunday the whole Price Family and I went to an animal park in the country side. The weather was nice but very windy. There was a funny looking feasant which Siri thought looked like Elvis. He really did with his large tuft of pitch black feathers on his head and the white suite of silver-spotted body feathers.  We got to hold baby chicks in the hatchery, and when we went to the falconery I got to hold a big European Eagle Owl called Honey. She was beautiful! brve Jesper held her too, plus 2 other birds of prey. Freja got to hold a very cute Barn Owl, whereas Siri fed a buzzard on her arm. After an excitig day we stopped for Fish&Chips on the way back home.    For the past 2 days I am drug free, i.e. I haven't taken any paracetamol for my back pain. I now only take a herbal remedy called Kawa Kawa root. Keep your fingers crossed that I will be able to keep this up. But isn't it funny though that I am able to do this less than a week after leaving on this trip? I think I was very keen to get away.  Have a good week! Today Margita and I are going on the tourist bus around the city.

      Last night, Friday, Margita had invited 5 of her colleagues for dinner: Alan, Simon, John, Roger and Robert. They all had hamburgers and sausages, while the 2 vegetarians (Robert & I) had oven roasted vegetables, pasta salad and green salad. Jesper gave us a brief flute concert [I will try to post his photo here eventually] before we went downtown to visit a few pubs.    First we went to the Berlin Bierhaus, which was located just past Alva Street (for those of you who don't know, my niece is called Alva). Then Alan insisted we go to Harry's Bar. There were a lot of people, a hen party with a dancing blow-up doll, there was a lot of smoke and extremely loud music. I immediately had to put in bits of kleenex in my ears in order to stay sane. Just goes to show that I have outgrown the previously joyful experience of hanging out in bars... The energy field is so different in bars and after all the cleansing I have done lately I need calmer and more harmonious surroundings. Nevertheless, we had a good time and Margita and I came home at a very respectful time around eleven.  Ah, I have just found where I can change the timing of my posting. This time it will be Edinburgh time instead of California time.

      My trip has started!!! On Tuesday the 8th I landed in Edinburgh in great spirits. It was really nice to see the Price Family again: Margita & Nick, Jesper 9, Siri soon to be 7, and my godchild Freja who will be 5 later this month.     The departure from Geneva was a nice suprise. I had proudly packed one suitcase which weighed 20.4kgs. I also had one carry-on with a beauty case on wheels and my back-pack. The lady at the check-in counter said she had never seen such a thick packet of tickets. When she heard about my adventure over the coming six months she smiled and gave me Priority tags on my luggage, "For a lucky start to the trip"', she said.    The surprise was that I am allowed to carry 2 pieces of luggage with 32kgs each on the overseas legs of the trip. Luckily I only packed the one suitcase because with my back I'd never be able to lug around as much as 64 kilos, forget it. But it gives me a bit of room if I'd like to buy something later on. For now what I have is enough.    Yesterday I rested after many late nights last week preparing the trip. Today I went for a bicycle ride around the neighbourhood. The kids are eager to meet me and play with me after school as of 14:15 and onwards every day. Right now they are all at their swimming lesson which means I can get some time to type this. Margita and I will do a tour of the city on Monday. Hopefully I can take some nice photos.

      I'm glad I found out about Blogging. This way I will be able to share a brief diary about my trip around the world to see friends.  Only 42 more hours before I take off on my World Tour 2004. I'm very eager to get going but still have a lot to do. Must get back to my papers.... See you soon on this Blog!

       What an amazing show! All the artists are doing amazing things. Not your average circus.... I missed them when they came by Geneva last year so I am very happy that I got to see them here in Calgary. If you get a chance to go see the Cirque du Soleil, GO.   Sharilyn and I were just talking this morning about how wonderful human potential is. If you train enough your body can do fantastic things.      In a short while Sharilyn will take me up to her new Cabin at Buck Lake, about 2,5 hours north of Calgary. From there we will to a road trip, a kind of Thelma and Louise trip but without the illegal stuff, with two kids in tow, and a different ending. We are heading for Vancouver on the west coast. We will see the Rocky Mountains and the wine districts. We will spend 3 days on Vancouver Island. After that we head back in-country to Sharilyn's parents' cabin. Also by a beautiful lake.      On 26 August I will return to Calgary for a last few days before heading off to California...

       Today I went to the coolest and biggest Harley Davidson shop I have ever been to. Too bad I didn't bring my camera. Above the entrance there is a huge fork with a wheel. Very cool. The salespeople introduce themselves by name and shake your hand when you come in. I was very impressed. They had a large remaining stock of the 2003 Centenary version bikes. Hard to believe when what we heard over in Europe last summer was that there were no more to be had last year...      Sharilyn, a very good friend from Red Cross during my Asia posting, brought me there along with her two kids Kieran and Laurel. After admiring the bikes in the shop we went to the front into the Harley diner which was decorated in Harley orange, black and crem white. Very nice place. Today's special was a "HOG Wash, Vodka Paralizer." I didn't have one, because I have been drinking way too much over the past few days. Kieran, who will be 5 next month, had fish and chips and managed to finish one of the HUGE pieces of fish on his plate. It was a real Harley driver meal alright. Sharilyn and I had Chef Salads, while little Laurel (19 months) had bits and pieces of fish and ham.      This past week in Calgary has been great. Lots of shopping, more shopping, quite a lot of drinking and then a bit more drinking. As you can see I've been having so much fun that I haven't even had time to write in here. Actually, Sharilyn and I are going off for drinks right now, she tells me, so I'd better write off here and continue later. After the drinks we are going for dinner and then to see the Cirque Du Soleil show Quidam. I'm very much looking forward too it. More later...

       Before telling you about Ottawa I have something very important to say:     &nbsp;   26/7 -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROBERTA!!!     &nbsp;   My arrival to Ottawa was my very first visit to Canada. I instantly liked it. Roberta brought me first to the farmers' market in the middle of town and then&nbsp;home to her beautiful house about 25min north of the city on the Quebec side. (I realise I should probably invite Roberta to do some interior decorating for me, I liked&nbsp;the way she has made up the house so much.)     &nbsp;   Although Roberta had arranged for me to go to a dinner that evening, I was exhausted from an early start in Washington that morning. It was also&nbsp;nice just to have&nbsp;personal logistics&nbsp;time all by myself that evening.&nbsp;I have to schedule in more of that during this trip.&nbsp;I unpacked everything in my suitcase, did lots of laundry and ironing. Yes, I did the ironing&nbsp;even if the clothes were going straight back into the suitcase again. (For those of you who don't travel as much, I can tell you that the fit in the suitcase is much better if you&nbsp;iron your clothes first.)&nbsp;   I also took time out to&nbsp;write a couple of blog entries, which&nbsp;I posted the following morning.     &nbsp;   Roberta and her husband&nbsp;Sandy have a very nice cottage by a lake 1,5 hour north of Ottawa.&nbsp;Our trip there&nbsp;the next day&nbsp;I saw as&nbsp;a great opportunity to get a first experience of the Canadian wilderness. On the way there Roberta got the use of Sandy's BMW M roadster (if you don't know it, check out the BMW website--it is one cool car!!! Slightly more sophisticated than my 1987 325ix.). It felt great to swish through the countryside with our&nbsp;caps on. Sandy graciously took all the luggage and the groceries in Roberta's Subaru.   The weather was wonderful that day.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The cottage is on a rocky incline down towards the lakeside. We&nbsp;jumped in&nbsp;immediately upon arrival. It was so beautiful and very similar landscape and nature to Sweden. Just some differences in&nbsp;flora and fauna. We took a boat ride around the lake in the sunset and watched the loons which were calling to us. We went passed some friends and received a very precious gift: chanterelle mushrooms. Mmmmm... We had them with butter, cream and a bit of white wine. Divine. After dinner I eagerly watched the humming birds flying back and forth to the feeder filled&nbsp;with sugar water. Very cute. There was a bird which had a very prominent whistle. Given its persistent song, we later we found out it was a Singing Sparrow.     &nbsp;   The next morning looked kind of grey and the rain started around noon. And did it ever rain. Roberta said in the 5 summers they have been there they have never seen such a downpour. The screened-in porch flooded with rain blowing in and the dinner table got soaking wet. We had a laugh and took a nap to recover from the thunder and lightning. Fortunately it cleared up by the next evening so we had another nice tour around the lake and saw beavers swimming right by the boat.     &nbsp;   Sandy had to go back to town, leaving&nbsp;us girls&nbsp;to talk and talk like girls do. We know each other from the Red Cross. Although she was doing consultancies even before,&nbsp;we are both thinking about what is next in our lives.&nbsp;We had a very nice time while discussing. Roberta had&nbsp;brought a book called  Energy Medicine by Donna Eden . My nose was stuck in this book&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of the time at the cottage. We did The Three Thumps, The Wayne Cook Posture, and Spinal Flush and felt all the better for it. We experienced some additional torrential rains and the drive way flooded sand all the way down the hill to the cottage deck. A ditch was dug to remedy the disaster so hopefully this will address the problem in the future.    &nbsp;   Although we did get some more sunshine, the rain was mostly on the agenda and Roberta had to wipe the dinner table on a couple of more occasions before we left. Unfortunately the top had to be on the M roadster Thursday on the way back to Ottawa. Thusday night we all went to see Spiderman 2 and had a great Thai meal. Friday was a last chance to&nbsp;drive around&nbsp;some of the city but I did no sightseeing at all. It wasn't that kind of visit and I thoroughly enjoyed it that way.

       Lance Armstrong just won the Tour De France for the 6th consecutive time!!! I have a tremendous amount of respect for that man. What an athlete! Last summer I went on my Harley into the mountains  down  a road where all the T de F cyclists had gone UP. Wow...and to think they go up hills at between 22-25km/h.&nbsp;I even have great respect for Jimmy Casper,&nbsp;&nbsp;the poor guy who came last for the 2nd time in a row, nearly 4 hours behind Lance.    &nbsp;  On Friday night I arrived in Calgary. I received certain comments that I must start posting blog entries again after my (off-line) cottage visit in Ottawa. Well, it's encouraging to know that people read what I write in here and look forward to what's next. Makes me want to write more.    &nbsp;  Ok, I will post a couple of things today so keep reading folks. But first I must call my nephew who turns 18 today    &nbsp;    HAPPY 18th BIRTHDAY MAX!!!!!!      &nbsp;

       Noreen lives in Maryland in Darnestown just north of Washington DC. I arrived on 5 July after the wedding and stayed until the morning of the 17th. Noreen and I have known each other for 13 years. We met in Geneva when she worked for the WHO. At the moment she is between projects and is recovering from suffering a severely broken foot last summer.  &nbsp;  Noreen introduced me to her astrologer in 1994. She did a reading for me when I was based in Cambodia, and I have done about 4 since then. We went to see Eleanor the day following my arrival so that we could actually meet face to face for the first time. We had a great time and then I received my first face-to-face astrology reading, as opposed to on a cassette. It is amazing how the planets influence you. My Uranus opposition is having all sorts of influence on me right now.  [Should you be interested in a reading please send Eleanor an email at    urlLink   rolphkibrick@mindspring.com      and tell her you are a friend of mine.]   &nbsp;  Given that I have specifically told people that I am not on a tourist trip, Noreen took me on a slightly different tour around WDC. She took me around to a couple of the sights seen in the movie Farenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore. Since I didnât feel like stopping anywhere, I took pictures around the city by doing what we jokingly called âdrive-by-shootingâ. Last Sunday I finally got to see the movie as well. It was great to hear the response from the audience and I'm really glad i got to see it in the USA. &nbsp;  We did go to the Eastern Market just behind the Capitol. I love markets and always enjoy a stroll around the stands. Next we went to a place called Adamâs Morgan where they have a pub called âMadamâs Organâ. You can imagine the painting on the wall of the pubâ¦ The neon sign outside the door says: Sorry, weâre open.â  &nbsp;  Around town we met various anti-Bush campaigners. In Adamâs Morgan we saw a group called Run Against Bush. The organize runs around the White House every weekâ¦  &nbsp;  Anyway, there is more to be said about WDC but I have to stop here as Iâm heading out to a cottage in the Canadian wilderness for a few days. There is no electricity and no internet. Wonderful! I hope I get to see some bears.

        As I travel and stay with people I notice things, both about them and about myself. Have you noticed how people have different energy? How we sometimes are more energetic and sometimes more laid back? Some people bounce around life, while others are nervous or calm in their general nature. Of course I notice these things in the people I meet. But what I realize while making this trip is that I am totally exposed to and made aware of the different energies in the homes of the people I stay with. What is even more interesting for me to observe is my own reaction to these different energies. Sometimes what I notice are habits, sometimes rituals, or even ways of speaking, all of which give indications of the energy present in the home Iâm visiting. Food habits also have an impact on the energy present as we all take in the energy of the food we consume.  &nbsp;  When you travel on the way I do this phenomenon that I am describing becomes even more apparent. It is very different to when you travel and then go back home and then go on another trip. During this trip itâs not possible for me to go home and dwell around in my own energy and surroundings. I go from one country to another (yet a very different energy already there!) and from one home to the next. Itâs a very funny and unusual experience. I try my best to simply âbeâ in and with the energy and the habits that surround me and not make any judgment. Observing is much more powerful than judging. I have found this so interesting that I will try to describe a couple of situations for you.  &nbsp;  When visiting my friends I try to be respectful of their habits and space, while at the same time trying to help out as best I can. While in Edinburgh I supported Margita in the kitchen. I helped putting the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and replacing the clean plates in their cupboard. With 3 kids it tended to fill up rather easily. As Per and Eva, my brother and sister-in-law, will know, âdishwasher-dutyâ is one of the things I like to help out with when I visit their home in Stockholm. Margitaâs husband, Nick, also has a habit of taking care of the dirty dishes in the kitchen. Except his approach is quite different from mineâ¦  &nbsp;  How do you operate when putting your dirty dishes in your dishwasher? Are you a rinsing kind of person or do you just stick it in there with food still visible? Do you have a system for putting the plates and glasses in? Everything in their place or do you let the cups stash where they fit in? Iâm only asking so that you can start to analyse your own behaviour a bit.  &nbsp;  Nick definitely has a system for putting in his dishes. He rinses the dirty dishes thoroughly under the running tap before putting them in the washer. In fact, he nearly does the dishes before putting the dishes in the washer.&nbsp; When stacking the plates he places them in order of size and nearly in a colour coordinated manner. The cups and glasses are arranged by precision on the top shelf. According to his standards he is acting totally logically. According to my standards he is a compulsive dish-control freak. If I would have put in the dirty dishes during the day and Nick would continue with this duty in the evening, he would actually take out all the dishes I had put in, rinse them, and put them back according to whatever system he follows.  &nbsp;  The first time I noticed this behaviour, I observed Nick in total disbelief. How on earth could a person go through with all this work when having a dishwasher that is supposed to do the work for you? Margita laughed with me and said: âI gave up commenting about Nickâs dishwasher activities years ago!â Towards the end of my 2,5 week stay I started to actively make fun of Nick. I said the dishes still got washed when he wasnât around, and I asked if he could notice the difference on the plate taken out of the cupboard. I asked him why he went through all the trouble. His stern comment was: âThings have to be done properly.â Thatâs when I realised how attached to this behaviour he is.  &nbsp;  One night Margita and I sneaked into the kitchen and started messing up the order of the dishes Nick had just rinsed and put in the washer. We moved plates and glasses around, making it look really messy by putting plates diagonally and in the âwrongâ place etc. We expected him to comment but Margita suspected he didnât even notice but just went through his regular motions of putting things back in order.  &nbsp;  Although my mind really rebelled against Nick compulsive behaviour, I also tried to see things his way and decided to see if I could learn from it. I tried to see where I might need more order in my life and where I might benefit from âdoing things properlyâ. Perhaps we might all benefit from examining our âdishwasher behaviourâ and bring it to a different are of our life to make a difference?  &nbsp;  At the same time I really started to wonder whether Nick bring this same behaviour to his office, and whether he keeps doing other peopleâs work over again until things are âdone properlyâ. Dear Nick, I can only hope&nbsp;that as&nbsp;you get older and wiser that&nbsp;you relax&nbsp;your attitude to dishes a bit.  &nbsp;  By the way, there are other ways of using your dishwasher. Noreen (who I visited outside Washington DC) uses her dishwasher as the rack to dry the dishes she has just washed by hand. The reason for this is&nbsp;that the house she lives in is so old that she doesnât dare to use the dishwasher anymore. Roberta here in Ottawa has the most old-fashioned dishwasher I have ever seen. I can&nbsp;presume it works very well since I discovered dirty dishes in there--non-rinsed, I might addâwhen I put in my own plate&nbsp;last night.

      The wedding between Vidar and Malin took place on an island off the west coast of Sweden. You get to Styrso island by taking the tram from central Gothenburg to Saltholmen and then you can use the same ticket for the half hour boat ride out to the island. Amazing. This was a full 3-day wedding party, and for me it started already on Thursday.  I arrived to the car-free island in the afternoon. I quickly realised that the preferred means of transport on the island was the ever so Swedish "flak-moppe", or a three-wheel moped with a flat carrier top in front. I trotted up the island to the 100-year old house which was to be my accommodation. It was right next to the church. I was to share the bedroom with 2 other girls but for now I was alone. 12 people in all were to live in this beautiful Herlitz house, which had a terrace in the garden with a fabulous view of the island. The communal breakfast for all of us was provided by the bride and groom, who were very keen that their guests were feeling comfortable.  Thursday night we all had dinner at the Herlitz house. When I arrived only the family and people helping with the wedding had arrived. They were all very busy with the preparations. Hence, I helped out with the dinner arrangements for the whole gang. We had a BBQ on the terrace with the view. It was quite windy and cool, but after a day with a bit of rain it was nice to be able to sit outside in the evening.  Friday was nice and sunny and as I left the house I took a peek inside the church. A funeral had just been held, which only goes to show that it is a living church. For the next four hours I helped Bjarne, a friend of Vidar's and the volunteer cook, to cut vegetables for the 90-people dinner taking place that evening. The three of us helping out with the various chores of fileting fish, cutting vegetables, and peeling potatoes, had a lot of fun. Bjarne made sure to keep us served with nice cool white wine while he made the artistic work of preparing delicisous paella and two kinds of fish soup. After a small mishap of a blown fuse (imagine cooking for 90 people!), Bjarne could coninue his cooking. The bride's brother, Erik, was busy driving around on a "Flak-moppe" helping the arrivng guests to their various accommodations. It had proved quite a challenge to house 103 guests on an island with only one hotel!  Friday night drinks and dinner were held by the water in a kind of club house. Bjarne's cooking was disappearingly good. Norwegian and Swedish guests continued to arrive during a day which saw a lot of movement on the roads due to vacation travel. Once everyone had settled some speeches were held for Malin and Vidar. Among other items, some friends had arranged a singing match between Vidar and Malin which was extremely funny. Malin's stepfather gave Vidar a parcel containing all sorts of Swedish goods from blue and yellow t-shirts with crowns on them, to ditto boxer shorts, socks etc. This evening was a nice informal occasion to get to know some of the guests. There was an awful lot of wine available. 18 bottles of red, even more white, lots of beer. By the time the last party people had left at 4 in the morning only one bottle was left.... Luckily I decided to go home at midnight.  Saturday morning I was woken up by the birds at 4am. I could just see the church from my window on a day which looked very promising indeed. The next time I woke up at 9 it was pouring down with rain. Wow, was this the way it was going to turn out after we had come all this way to this beautiful island? It kept raining for a coule of hours, but cleared up in time for the wedding in the afternoon.  By Saturday morning the Herlitz house had filled up with all the other people staying over, among them 2 cute babies of 4 and 6 months. The bride's hairdresser, Hans, stayed at Herlitz house as well. He took care of fixing the hair and makeup for the bride and her sister. It was nice to see them get ready, while they were carefully hiding their dresses under big black plastic bags. The time was getting closer...  By 15:15 everyone had gathered in the warm sun in front of the church and we were asked to get seated. A lovely bridal march was played on violin as the couple walked up the isle. The ceremony was very personal and beautiful. Many of us cried, as did the wedding couple. After the ceremony it was back to the pension where the dinner was to be held. The wedding coule took the only maxi-taxi on the island to the helicopter pad, where they changed vehicle. Vidar drove the obligatory "flak-moppe" up to the pension with his wife on board. I caught a very funny 15-second video clip of their arrival. I hope I manage to find a way to post it somewhere so you can see it. It was an arrival in style with all the guests laughing out loud!  After champagne and strawberries it was time for dinner. I was extremely lucky to be seated at the long table next to the one with the wedding couple and I had a great view. I had Danish Rasmus to my left, Swedish Nisse to my right, and Norwegian Oystein opposite. A truly Scandinavian mix. Each of us had a small leaflet beside our plates. Normally this would be the menu you would guess? Not in this case. It was a complete list of the names of every guest present and a brief presentation. What a splendid idea! Beside my name it said something like:  Humanitarian globetrotter. Patient ski teacher to Vidar.  This list kept conversations going and as the evening went on it felt like I knew more and more people.  The pension where the dinner was held was very nervous because it was the biggest wedding party they had ever cooked for. They need not have worried because the food was absolutely sublime. The starter was a nice plate of various exotic mixtures of herring. The one with basilica was very tasty. This was followed by a fantastic flat fish (halibut?) and a white wine which was divine. I don't particularly like white wine but this Alsace was fantastic. Then followed a chicken with lime rice, but given that I don't eat meat I was served fresh cod instead. What a treat! The red wine was in a class of its own as well and everyone was marvelling at the food.  The toast masters made themselves known and started off the speeches. Every single speech made us laugh and cry. Every speech was very well prepared and highly interesting. And there were quite a few. The amusement factor was on top and the boredom nowhere to be seen. The one speehc which had us all in stitches was when Vidar's brother read the essay Vidar wrote about the cow when he was 8 years old. " ...The cow has four legs. They are called cow legs. The cow has hair. It is called cow hair. It is brown. That's why it's called cow-lour. " And so on... I think 8-year old Vidar had been improved along the line a bit, but it sure made us laugh!  After 5 hours of sitting down it was time for coffee and a chance to move around a bit. The tables were removed so that the band could put their instruments in place. By midnight everyone was dancing and kept at it for many hours. By 3 it was time for a typical Swedish snack: Jansson's Temptation. Yummy! By 4 the band had gone to bed and the staff kicked the 30 or 40 of us still partying out of the main dining room. We continued to party in a different part of the building. In fact, this part of the building was right outside the room of the priest. Poor woman and her husban... It was raining outside so I used this as an excuse that I couldn't go back home. By 5 the bride and groom finally decided that they should get some sleep and left the brave dozen or so still dancing. Malin really wanted people to enjoy themselves and party all night. Well, she got what she asked for!  Hans the hairdresser and I borrowed bicycles from the pension and made our way home in the drizzle. It was a lovely morning and we saw fishing boats going out to sea. We had so many giggles on the way back home we probably woke up half the island. Our bicycles didn't have any protection on the back tyre. Hence, the water spurted up our back making us very wet all from the saddle and up. Major giggle-enhancer. Hans sang opera on the way back. I managed to take a picture of him while riding. Once back at Herlitz house we decided to have some cheese and a beer. By 6:30 we were ready to go to bed and decided to make it up in enough time to make the brunch between ending at 13:30.  By 10 I was already awake. I decided to shower while there was still hot water (yes, all 11 of us shared one shower). Sabina who shared my room was also waking up and we chatted about what a nice party it had been. We were full of admiration and I decided I wanted to spend more time with all the nice people and decided to go to the brunch early. Needless to say, there were only a few brave people up at that hour at the pension. The priest and her husband were off to attend service at the church. They had slept little but said they enjoyed the comfortable beds while listening to the party people singing and dancing right outside their door until 05:30. Malin and Vidar were of course up in style and were very happy with the successful party. During brunch it was nice to catch up with the people from the night before and to get a chance to praise the staff in the kitchen.  During the day guests left on the boats back to Gothenburg. I left with the majority of the people at 15:00. We had had a great time and many of us were tired but happy. Poor Erik had been so busy during 3 days on the "flak-moppe" that he fell asleep on the boat back. Most of us felt we could do the same.  During all these days I took many photos. I am experimenting with a new site for posting photos. Please take a look at: http://ssoderstrom.photosite.com It would take me a too long to download all of them but hopefully you will be able to view a nice selection of them soon.

      After Lynga Horse Farm I went to see my maternal aunt at her cabin in the countryside. Her little house is in the middle of the woods, as the crow flies quite near Alingsas (which is east of Gothenburg, for those of you who might still be lost).  I love going to Maj-britt's house because of the calm and quiet. The fire from the iron stove in the kitchen always smells so nice, and we take lovely walks in the surrounding woods. During this visit she showed me a phenomenon which I have never witnessed before. She took me to a big bush of burning nettles and said: "Look at the babies, aren't they cute?!!!" She meant the little brown and black worms crawling around. Well, that's what I thought, anyway. They were actually the larvae for a well-known Swedish butterfly.  Once I had spotted the larvae, which after a while did look quite cute, I went to check on them at least twice a day. They changed skin and went from brown to hairy black. They ate their home and moved on to the next nettle plant. They split up into two small gangs, etc etc. There was always something happening on the nettle bush while I was visiting. I don't know how long it will take them to reach butterfly stage but they were doing great by the time I left.  While at the cabin I finished a wonderful book which Susanne gave me. It took only a day or so to read.  The Alchemist by Paulo Cohelo . Brazilian author. The book was number one on the Swedish best seller list in the book shops. A very wise story about a goat herder going off to find a treasure. A MUST READ with lost of nice messages!  Before that I had already started (and by the time I'm writing this also finished) a book called  Intuition by Osho . Since doing the cleanse I find myself being much more intuitive and even telepathic comapred to before. While I was in Edinburgh I just went into a book store and bought this book. It turned out to be very interesting reading. Here are a few quotes: Talking about Barriers to Knowing, Osho says: "Millions of people carry their office home with them. Your intellect is needed. Your head has its own function, its own beauty, but it should be in its place. Theree are far greater things that are beyond the reach of the head, and when you are moving into those realms, you should put the head aside. You should be capable of that. That's flexibility. That is intelligence.  And remember never to get confused between intellect and intelligence. Intellect is only part of intelligence. Intelligence is a far bigger phenomenon; it contains much more than intellect, because life is not only intellectual, life is intuitive too. Intelligence contains intuition. So many great discoveries have been made not by intellect but by intuition. In fact, all the great discoveries have been made by the intuition."  From the chapter on Strategies: "The heart is feminine. You miss much in your life because the head goes on talking; it does not allow the heart. And the only quality in the head is that it is more articulate, cunning, dangerous, violent."  This from the same chapter calls to me in relation to this trip I'm making: "The beauty of facing life unprepared is tremendous. Then life has a newness, a youth, then life has a flow and freshness. Then life has so many surprises. And when life has so many surprises, boredom never settles in you."  Strategies again: "...the intelligence of the head is not intelligence at all; it is knowledgeability. The intelligence of the heart  is  the intelligence, the only intelligence there is. The head is simply an accumulator. It is always old, it is never new, it is never original. It is good for certain purposes; for filing it is perfectly good. And in life one needs this--many things have to be remembered. The mind, the head is a biocomputer. You can go on accumulating knowledge in it, and whenever you need you can take it out. It is good for mathematics, good for calculation, good for the day-to-day life, the marketplace. But if you think this is your whole life, then you will remain stupid. You will never know the beauty of feeling, and you will never know the blessing of the heart."   And then from the afterword:  The distinction is subtle, but it is the same distinction as between the mind and the heart, between logic and love...between prose and poetry. A destination is a clear-cut thing; direction is intuitive. A destination is something outside you, more like a thing. A direction is an inner feeling; not an object, but your very subjectivity. You can feel direction, you can not know it. You can know the destination, you can not feel it... ...Destination is fixed by the mind; direction is earned by living. ...You cannot decide direction, you can only live this moment that is available to you. By living it, direction arises."  This trip that I am making has a lot to do with direction and living. Although there are quite a few destinations on the trip, while at the desintations the trip has much more to do with direction and inner feeling than anything else. This is what I am exploring with the friends that I visit.

      Yes, I am back on-line again, after an unusually long absence. But it so happens that it is 10:30pm here in Washington and I'm still jetlagged.... Therefore, no lenghty posting tonight. But if you are waiting for something good.... :-)  I have a lot to write about, a couple of books, a nice visit to my aunt, the wonderful wedding on the west coast of Sweden, my arrival and past couple of days in Darnestown outside Washington DC.  See you soon!

       Well, we left Ravelstoke Thursday morning and drove all day in the rain all the way to Abbotsford, Sharilyn's home town (and yes, we did stop in Kamloops on the way there!). That evening I was feeling so tired and could feel my throat getting sore. I have spent the past 3 days in bed with fever and probably a strep throat or something. Yesterday I was feeling a lot better and finally today I dared to venture out with Sharilyn and the kids to buy yummy blueberries.      Here in Abbotsford we have been staying at the (non-air conditioned) house of Sharilyn's sister and her family. They are all up at the cabin by the lake until Sunday. Right now I am sitting in the nice air-conditioned house of Sharilyn's parents. It feels great, especially since it is +38C outside. Luckily it rained the first 2 days when I was sick... We will have dinner here in a nice cool temperature before heading off again.      Imagine my surpsrise when we went to the blueberry farm this morning. I was so mad I didn't bring my camera. They had a huge blueberry-picker which went through blueberry fileds the size of vineyards!!! The bushes don't look anything at all like what I'm used to seeing in the forests back in Sweden. We bought a 5kg box and really stuffed ourselves with blueberries for lunch. Yummy! Some of the berries are as big as cherries. Amazing.      In Ravelstoke I didn't even have time to write about the trip. I had to buy a time card to log on to the internet and although I bought 30 minutes it ran out after 15. She gave me another 30min card and that one ran out after 15 too. Hence my hurried typing. We had a really great day that first day of driving. THe stop at Lake Louise was really nice. There is a huge hotel up there and there were so many tourists heading up there that we had to wait in a queue to get to a parking. Sharilyn (aka Samy) kept asking me to look out for wildlife along the road during the drive, but it was sparse. We saw tame gofers begging for food at one of our quick stops. No bears... boo hoo...      Tonight we do the one hour drive to Vancouver to visit Samy's in-laws. They have kindly offered to babysit for 3 days while we go to visit Vancouver Island. That promises to be a great trip. Samy has been planning this since February when I told her I would be coming over. I'm so glad that I got well again so that we can do it. If you look at a map, we will be going to places like Victoria and Tofino. The ferry lands in Namtua. I hope it is a bit cooler there with a bit of a sea breeze.      As for the subservient chicken, I tried to get it plucked and grilled, but it didn't want to obey... Did anyone else try except my Whales&amp;Wolves friend?

       Buck Lake is a small lake SW of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada. That is where Sharilyn and Bruce's cabin is. Sharilyn and I arrived there on Saturday afternoon after our lovely spectacle at Cirque du Soleil. The cabin is great, an orange house with red roof and HUGE logs inside holding up the ceiling. It takes 30s to walk down to the lake. They have a hot tub on the deck outside the kitchen, where we relaxed every evening.      Bruce and little Kieran took me out fishing in their paddle boat (they haven't had time to buy a proper boat just yet). I spit in the water three times, like any good Swede would do, to brign me good luck during out morning fishing trip. The boys were very good to me, giving me the best lures. Well, I caught 2 pike in two different spots. Unfortunately, neither pike met the required 63cm for brigning it back home for dinner, but I sure had fun fishing all the same. The poor boys didn't get anything that day so I thanked the spitting!      The next afternoon Sharilyn went fishing with the boys. Kieran caught 2 Walleye. Sharilyn, who took my advice and spit 3 times, caught none other than 5 Pike and 4 Walleye!!! She was extatic. Poor Bruce didn't catch anything, until the very last minute when a little pike felt pity for him and got hooked. Sharilyn was so proud all evening, while the boys were sulking a bit.      In the evening last night there was a big thurnderstorm at the cabin. Bruce had gone back to Calgary to work and Sharilyn and I were out on the deck looking at the lightning show. She told me about the tornadoes that sometimes hit, and how it is best to hide in the bathtub if you don't have a cellar (which their cabin doesn't). As we were still giggling from this and the lightshow and just about to go to bed at 22:30, there is someone at the door. By this time the rain had started to pour down quite heavily and there was a strong wind. Diane Love, one of the neighbours, told us that there a tornado had hit Rimbey about 35km away and was heading to Buck Lake. They had the truck outside out house, rady to evacuate us to the neighbour's basement! We ran to put some clothes on, got the kids out of bed and hurried outside. Phew... What a suprise! We spent the next hour and a half at the neighbour's basement watching the Weather Channel. It soon became clear that the tornado had died down and had gone on the other side of the lake. The kids were having a grand time playing with toys and we were given drinks to calm down.      At midnight they drove us back without anything having happened, but it seemed the bad weather from Ottawa and the cottage finally caught up with me! :-) We had a shorter night's sleep than planned before our road trip, but it felt good to be back in our beds again.      This morning we left the cabin to go past the Rocky Mountains. We left at 08:10 and stopped an hour and a half later in Nordegg, a tiny sleep little settlement in the middle of the woods. We had our breakfast at the Coalminsers' Cafe together with surprisingly many other guests (there were not many other places around that area to stop). The room smelled of nice home cooking, but mostly oily fried dishes. The funny thing was that all the chairs in the room were old office chairs with wheels and armrests. I've never seen a cafe like that before. The kids were very well-behaved and once done played outside in the little coal train before we took off again.      We got to Lake Louise for lunch. We ate at the Deer Lodge which was a nice oldfashioned place.  Later we went for a walk around the lake and watched the wonderful glacier-green water. The rain caught up with us again on the way down. Tonight we are sleeping in Ravelstoke at  urlLink www.regentinn.com        My time is running out on this thing so I'll write more tomorrow from Kamloops...
