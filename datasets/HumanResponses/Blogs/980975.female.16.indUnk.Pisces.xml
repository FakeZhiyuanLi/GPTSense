      Well today was such a change in life.... I had a fabulous day. I turned in my term paper, no more worry about that and I finished my study questions... that was school, nothing special. .................. ..................... After school I got together with my chums: Erin, Andrew, Nathan and Tally, we all took the el bus-o to Andrew's where he gave me a cookie and got some money and we headed to 15th to buy CD's. I bought a Death Cab For Cutie compact disc and it was cheap, which made me happy. Then we walked over to Broadway and walked around going to different stores and eating shakes and cheeseburgers. Tally and I then took a walk to look at some of the great sites of Seattle, after making our rounds we went back to the village of value and met up with the rest of the gang and I bought a little T-shirt that makes me have a uni-boob, it was a laugh and a pour >the rain made me laugh while Nathan, Erin and I ran to the bus stop to wait for the numero 7 ::we stopped underneath a bridge and watched the rain come down and it was so peaceful::  how is my brain? Not so large and full of sickness and full of glowingness *wink* what am I jamming to? °IT'S TRICKY!!!!° RRRUN RUUUN RUNNN DMC i should be...? working out and sleeping at the same time (hopefully sometime that will happen, i should try that 48 hour hollywood diet >"WORKS WHILE YOU SLEEP!!!"

      How many times do I have to say To get away, get gone Flip your shit past another lasses Humble dwelling You got your game, made your shot And you got away With a lot, but I'm not turned-on So put away that meat you're selling 'Cause I do know what's good for me And I've done what I could for you But you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting Singing again, sing, sing again How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this Am I gonna heal from this, he won't admit to it Nothing to figure out, I got to get him out It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me 'Cause I do know what's good for me And I've done what I could for you But you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting Singing again, sing, sing again How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this Am I gonna heal from this, he won't admit to it Nothing to figure out, I got to get him out It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me How many times can it escalate 'Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe? And I must decide, if you must deride That I'm much obliged to up and go I'll idealize, then realize That it's no sacrifice, because the price is paid And there's nothing left to grieve Fuckin go 'Cause I've done what I could for you And I do know what's good for me And I'm not benefiting Instead I'm sitting singing again, singing again Singing again, sing, sing, sing again How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this Am I gonna heal from this, he won't admit to it Nothing to figure out, I got to get him out It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this Am I gonna heal from this, he won't admit to it Nothing to figure out, I got to get him out It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me  present state of my brain? large and full of sickness present music of my brain? one good spliff present thing my brain should be doing? writing a term paper

      Tuesday was a hoot and holler just ask emmy, WOO. ........... emmy and i came home and chilled with some of our homies and yeah had a good time with that and i dare not say more.... except, it was happy and so uncomfortable it was comfortable.  >today I watched little girls and made $40 doing so... NICE.  ... tomorrow i am going off by myself to downtown to pick up a few things that i want, a couple of compact discs and i am terribly excited  nothing exciting happened today and it made me sad because usually comething exciting happens. *ah yes, i got to beat up Hoseph, that made my day*  i missed tally while he was gone, because he is nice and yeah, i am glad he is back  Andrew is leaving, i will miss my math buddy, he will be back though, good.  i am listening to my brothers gangster rap and it is pretty... sigh.  someone told me i was a bitch today ** to you** fuck you, maybe i am a bitch or maybe you are too sensative, or maybe it is a little of both, plus, i need to be a bitch, i don't know why, but i need a little bitchiness at all times. **someone told me i was a push over today, i don't get it, i am a bitchy push over??? oh snap.  ~i miss you, the way you made me laugh when nothing was funny, the way you laughed at yourself, the way you were happy, how slow you ate, i could tell you everything, how you got me, how you didn't care what i said and just took me for who i was, being attached at the hip, being so close, crazy lake swims, races that have nothing to do with cars, flying down the stairs in sleeping bags, cleaning out my sick bug cage, being mullet twins, mud wrestling, bollos de mantequilla, joselu.... i am happy you are coming back~  question frequently in my head: what if your life is someone elses dream and you are nothing but a dream? and are you a good dream or a bad dream?  secret of the day: i like bacon

      Monday Bonday, surprisingly pleasent. ...................bitter sweet symphony..........................  school was okay, lunch was better, i took Hoseph's shoes and he let me wear them like clown shoes and it made me feel all special and stuff, man i love Hoseph and he sure is a fox *wink* Next was school some more and that was that... yeah. After school I took the bus to Meals' house and he just had to work out, but it was okay because he made me laugh with his funny faces and I made him laugh with my lack of balance. I can bench 50 lbs once... BOO YA.  Let's see, then we went and had protein shakes, actually Meals had one and he made me try it, lets just say it wasn't the best shake i have ever had. >Then we chilled and chilled some more and I got to see his hair AND i did a pull up, i think that deserves another BOO YA My mom picked me up and we went out for burgers and now i am here listening to my piano music and leaving soon to pick up emmy. :::::::::::::GOODNIGHT SEATTLE!!!::::::::::::::: "you fall into the trap till it tears you apart" she said "my trap is my escape" she replied "it is your escape until to fall into to it the last time and you find you can't get out" she said "i don't want to get out, i want to be stay there forever" she replied "someday it will be closed and you will lose everything" she said "i know, that is why i die inside everytime i escape, it closes a little every time." she replied "I love you" she said "you love me" she replied

      ahhhhh Saturday was pure bliss... i am here to bore you, viva la mullet.  Took the bus was late and lost ben kell and nathan Met up at dicks with emmy and ate a deluxe dick Walked back to the ave and had a heart to heart, thank you em. Met up with the boys... erin showed up after seeing matrix reloaded, she said it was weird. Went back to my house with emmy and erin The boys showed up Went to madison park. Ate and drank goodness. Climbed the lifeguard tower and chilled at the beach chasing geese and watching otters. Bought instant pudding. Went home with Emmy and Nathan. Ate the pudding and listened to records. Watched The Breakfast Club. Watched The Brave Little Toaster. Watched The Rescuers Down Under. Lounged and had a peck of a time. Fell into deep slumber. Awoke to cell phone ringing ... "hello?" "hey, it's ross, i can't kick it today" "alright bye" "get some sleep"  -turns out he ditched us for Dani, woop woop-  Went downtown and to the gap. Bought matching thongs with Emmy and they are pink with polka dots and green coolness. We are dorks indeed, but at least we have cool underwear. Put on new under-roos in westlake bathroom. Went to see holes. Many cute boys in that movie. Took bus back to my house and are presently thinking, pondering and ringing.  present feeling?   ::::::::::::::::>snazzified

      what a day it has been indeed. good? bad? meh? it was good  i would say. it began with school, poopy school, but i got out at 10. then i went home ate took the bus to the zoo met up with rosso and we went on a speed viewing of the zoo that boy is crazy, i love him, he and i saw bats, hippos, and giraffes oh my. after ross sped off, emmy and i met up and went to see a movie not just any movie but finding nemo it was FABULOUS i laughed so hard and i can now speak whale BOO YA then we came home and ate and talked to miles and he was all beat up i laughed at him, it was funny yet sad *karma sucks ass doesn't it?* natalie had a fiasco emmy had to tend to it she left i am alone i am sad i am listening to sad music ----i hate having lows---- the two worst feelings? loneliness and envy sadly i am always envious and constantly lonely, but that is okay <><><><><><><> i think i am in love and it is odd because i don't know who i am in love with. i feel love. i know it is there. but i don't know who. i know who it isn't for. but i don't know who it is for. that doesn't make sense. but it does. just think. did you know i know the secret of love? it took a lot of thinking and observing ones in love. i found it out. love IS a secret. and when you are in love you know what the secret is. but you don't really know what the secret is. but you have the secret and that is enough. i don't want to love. my heart doesn't want to love now. it wants to pump blood into my system. that is enough for it right now. it can't handle pumping love.

      Once in a house on a hill A boy got angry He broke into my heart  For a day and a night I stayed beside him Until I had no hope  So I came down the hill Of course I was hurt But then I started to think  It shouldn't hurt me to be free It's what I really need To pull myself together But if it's so good being free Would you mind telling me Why I don't know what to do with myself  There's a bar by the dock Where I found myself Drinking with this man He offered me a cigarette And I accepted 'Cause it's been a very long time As it burned 'till the end I thought of the boy No one could ever forget  It shouldn't hurt me to be free It's what I really need To pull myself together But if it's so good being free Would you mind telling me Why I don't know what to do with myself  To pull myself together But if it's so good being free Would you mind telling me Why I don't know what to do with myself  To pull myself together But if it's so good being free Would you mind telling me Why I don't know what to do with myself

      wow, the past few days have been a blur, fun, yet a blur.   i have a very large amount of money right now. yes. goodness.  gray called me today, it made me happy.  I talked to kell for over an hour today, i love that boy he sure knows how to make me happy, yet very sad at the same time. I miss him. we are going to hang out tomorrow. i am excited.  i went shopping today and got some cool stuff, it made me happy to find cool stuff and have my mom pay for it. that is so nice.  nathan just said "i bet you are writing about me in your blogger" i wasn't planning on it, but now I will say something.  >don't flatter yourself. i think you hate me  i am going to see how to deal, that is right mandy moore is the pimp shit. I am going with Amelia and the funniest girl alive, Katherine. Damn I am excited.  my mom bought a penis cake, penis straws and penis lipstick today for a bachlorette party. I love it. I want a penis cake for my birthday, it would make it more funny.  it was miles' birthday yesturday, i remembered, i didn't say anything. I think I will make him some cookies. yes, i would like to do that.  someone said something odd to me today "you would be prettier than >blank okay then.  i hate it when i am not cool enough for people.  i also hate it when people act like your friend... but if you disappeared they probably wouldn't notice till someone told them years later.  erin is so cool. yeah, she is. she danced with me and a strange lady. what a good time. we have a good time. ah yes.   i want to make you smile whenever you're sad  carry you around when your arthritis is bad  all i want to do is grow old with you  i will get your medicine when your tummy aches  build you a fire if the furnice breaks oh it could be so nice growing old with you  i will miss you kiss you give you my coat when you are cold  I need you, feed you, even let you hold the remote control  so let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink  put you to bed when you've had to much to drink  i want to grow old with you  i love adam sandler. i love you adam. marry me?  you are married. i will settle for meatball.  .:eat my shorts:.

      oh my goodness! the past few days have been so fucking good I can't tell you... this is what summer is about.  friday: I met up with kell and we went to the fountain at the seattle center and we got all wet and then we slept in the sun. Then he bought me a BLT and we went and saw Pirates of the Carribean... Johnny Depp is soooooo hot, want to touch the heiny (is that how you spell that?)I WENT TO THE LITTLE WINGS SHOW!!! it was so good... erin and I were two feet from him and it was so awesome and I bought the bobby birdman CD. i got overalls too. it was tthe best day.  saturday: went to the block party... won a shirt and got a fake zippo... fun day. went to Hailey's and we ate really good food and then came back to my home and danced the night away  sunday: I went to the block party and met a bunch of fools from lakeside and they were all so nice and they are my new buddies... lets see there was ben, gray, mike, daniel and yeah... they were funny fools. we saw pedro the lion, the vells (again, spelling might be wrong), Calvin Johnson (so funny) and the united states of electronica.... oh wow, what a fun time. We went and listened to the techno goodness and danced, danced and danced some more. I got a dread...... oh yeah and thai food.  Monday: I hung out with Hailey Gus and Kye and we watched waiting for guffman and then we went to the park and had a fun time talking about poop. then I went and met up with charlotte and we chatted until mike showed up and then ben and daniel showed up and we all chilled at the beach until these fools that used to go to garfield came and played groovy music. Then I walked home with some fools and rented ferris buelers day off. so good. then i chilled and watched motorcycles with my brother and jeff (mwah) *twichtwich*  yeah....... you might not think it sounds like fun, but it has been so fabulous and I am in a mighty fine mood.

Once at Ben's house we headed to fremont to see an outdoor movie, A Rebel Without A Cause. Gray, Zach, Damien and Daniel were all there. Ben brought crackers and jam and we had a delightful time. The movie was so weird. I liked it though. Only me and Erin liked it. Erin stayed the night. She found something. I got it. Dats coo. On sunday morning I went to Hailey's and we watched movies and ate. we went to madison park and swam and chilled with Mike, Ben, Gray, Jamie and Zach... they are funny boys.  Got home and ate some more and watched good movies.  I was a bitch to hailey about evan. I am sorry, kind of. Finally i said "hailey next time you are the phone with evan i am going to grab it from you and say 'if you are going to spend the whole time talking to Hailey why did you even go to florida?" she wouldn't let me have the phone. damn.  .:did I just yell?:.  today was chill and relaxed.  AINARA IS BACK  LIFE IS GOOD  I LOVE YOU AINARA  yeah, she be coo.  //do you really want to hurt me? do you really want to make me cry?\ i am going with kell and greg on wednesday to watch holes get poked in people... i am ready for fainting.  gus and i are hanging out tomorrow. we might go to value village we might make cookies i dunno  peter called me. what a sweet boy. after 5 o'clock we have a date  i think i have said more then enough  i wanted to bore you  i promise         `someday my prince will come`

      today was fun... around 2:30 I finally arrived at Gus's house after a bus ride that was way to long and hot. we then watched undercover brother and played funny computer games, i am bill clinton... don't eat the weed, but eat the hamburgers. then we went to the store to buy the ingredients for BLT's. once home we ate and then scampered off to Adrian's mamas house. we began star wars but it wasn't so good.  then off we went and they did their business, while i picked berries for them and pretended to be paparazzi. ah, what fun.  off we went again to Gus's, where berry pie was served to everyone and Wayne's World was watched.   I told Gus he was dumb. he doesn't remember much. things I have told him a lot. i am sorry. you aren't dumb.  then he called me weird girl. and by that he ment retarded girl.  i got home, my mom killed a giant spider for me.  now i sit here, telling you this.               >vibrate on

      what a day it was. so fabulous. i am going to share the whole thing with you. don't get bored now.  babysat... 5 hours. Hailey came over. we stripped and went on my slip n' slide. i bought one the other day. it is so much fun. i am so cool it scares me >head inflating we shower and scoot to the down of the town. we wait for erin. for 50 minutes. while we are waiting a bunch of guys come and surround us. our conversation: you blow? huh? you blow dick? sorry. his friend comes in.. MAN! what is your problem? don't ask them that. other boy comes in. what are you guys doing here? we are waiting for a friend. you gunna suck his dick? actually it is a girl so, no. you lesbians? no. can I read your arm? sure.  then they just walked away. ha.  later we march up to the top of westlake and these to old mexican men talk about liking to look up our skirts. we close are legs and flick them off. they go down and continue to look up at us with there gold teeth until i look and point at my mouth with a grossed out face. then walked away quick.  erin shows up. we walk to FAO to catch the 7. while waiting the FAO dude in the suit comes and chats with us. i name his stuffed dragon Jesus, he names it red pointy tongue.  we get on the bus and meet two cracked out people who are very nice. stage and pebbles... their names. we chat with them.  they offer us drugs. we decline. I tell him i like his hair (the opposite of a mohawk- long on the sides and short strip down the middle.)  we get off and go to mexican food. so good. we talk about breast feeding. giant butterflies eating my nose. the waitress hears us talk about her... it takes her 20 minutes to get our check. bitch.  we leave to catch the 43 to my house.  the 8 rolls by and a guy on it i see is pointing at me and waving. i don't know him, so i simply wave back to the stranger and see him off. Hailey blows a kiss as a joke we laugh. we get on the 43 then a few stops later he gets on the bus. he sits away from us, but still close. I look at him and he sees me. he takes off his sunglasses. his eyes are splendid. i kept looking at him. we had to get off the bus. I was sad. we smiled at each other. then i waved him off yet again. we will meet again. oh yes, soul mate, we will meet again.  i just painted my nails and they are pretty.   kell angers me.  nathan is an odd one, but he makes me laugh. that is good. "no tan lines good!"  i have this tatooed on my ankle: "i am invisable, understand, simply because people refuse to see me." i love it.  hailey's birthday was good. we slept on the roof. we saw two shooting stars.             *your smell, i miss it*

      nathan decided to talk to me again. then he hung up because he had to go smoke. of course that was after he told me how stupid i was for wanting to do a something. well things are looking up, aren't they?   it is so hot out. i can't stand it. i am cooking. i wonder if i will taste good. I hope so. >lick  i watched a baby yesterday for seven hours and I did it today also and I do it tomorrow too, but with another baby. OY VAY.  i look like an earth kitten today. me-ow.   it is hailey's birthday.  happy birthday my darling. i love you.  i sang to her in several different voices, she laughed.  I am going to hang out with erin tomorrow i hope.  we shall have a ball.  we are going on a trip to mexico. ;-)  Kell gave me a braclet that he got in hickville. it has mother mary's all over it.  i am wearing Demetri's braclet too. I saw him the other day. he is nice boy. i wish we talked more often. humph.  Shayna and i are going to go to the japanese gardens. Gus might come. exciting.  well I am off to a cold place.  say what?  .:eat my shorts:.

      i just watched spirited away for the second time. it made my mood better. then it got bad again. damn it.  nathan won't see me or talk to me. no one phones me when they are simply requested to. It is amazing what a small phone call can do. it can make you feel so much better knowing that you were on someones mind and they wanted to talk to you so they took time from their day to say hello to you. what a delightful idea.  someone asked me what my freshman year was like. my reply. one half was fabulous the other awful. there was pity in their face. fuck you.  if i said everything that i missed, you would think that i complain too much and wish i would shut up, so all i will say is this.  i miss what was right and now it is all wrong.  or is it all a lie and i have it backwards?    .:they let me down hard.I fell hard.my heart is hard:.   kell laughed about my panic attack. if it hadn't have been so real i would laugh with him.  i think i am dying.  help me doctor.  what do you prescribe?

      it is weird when i am feeling down i am not just sad i feel like a part of me is missing there is this strange feeling at the top of my stomach like a sparkler is going off inside of me it always starts as anger sometimes the anger comes from something little, but usually i don't know where it comes from, it just does it moves from my stomach to my chest there it sits usually it stays until I push it away to a place where it hides i don't forget about it it just moves to a place where I don't have to think about it all the time the more I hide it, the quicker it comes back more and more often until I crack I yell I scream I cry I sit I listen I suck it up I go on with life Knowing it will be better It isn't better I want to hibernate I want to be old I want to be around people who have more of a plan in life then getting fucked up I want to be loved I want to trust again I want to be noticed I don't want more regrets I want to like myself I want people to stop thinking my life is like the fucking Brady Bunch  boy, i sound selfish. why don't you go cry about? .:okay:.

      this evening was fabulous. i dressed up like i was going to a cocktail party I looked vintage. I scampered to the laser dome and met up with Peter and Kalen. We talked and made fun of little girls till the lights dimmed. karma police. I loved it. It was laser sex. then off to ice cream at Dick's. we chilled. Peter almost got beat up by a thug. i laughed so hard I almost peed myself. I went home. may not sound to spiffy, but it was a hell of a time and it should have lasted longer. Bumbershoot is tomorrow. BOO YA.

      i bought a dress. i got a deal on pants. i was alone. i got my cool pictures developed. i love them. i sat and called greg. he was busy. went to the park. sat for hours. hailey came. nathan came. ate a pint of ice cream. juice. anger. sleep.  I have been with some friends the past few days and they have been very mean to their parents. now it is understandable, that you can be mean to your parents, but if they are being nice, in fact, offering to do things and being very nice, why must you be mean? i almost said something. i kept my mouth closed. i know it isn't my business. but to see you be so rude, when all you are getting is nice. it doesn't make sense. no sense at all. you might try to be better. perhaps you will find it might work. no one loves a bitch. especially one who is one for no reason at all.

      you don't notice when you do it why would you? I mean, unless you can watch yourself, you would never know. until you see other people doing it WHAM it hits you they look so stupid and you think, that is what i look like? sad, very sad. I have realized that I am indeed a good girl at heart. I have also fully accepted it. I can't do anything about it, so I shall not let it bother me. Although, it does. As i get older I get more self conscious and less ball-zy. god damn.  so, it was very scary. i didn't like it one bit.  stop telling me how i feel you fucking ass hole, you have no idea because you aren't me and I am tired of you telling people what I feel or how i felt. what the fuck? you have no idea. don't give me shit. if you don't like what I do or say. fuck off. don't be my friend. please just don't tell me how dumb I am.   sorry, i don't get it either.

      This is for you, if you ever choose to read it. Something happened. I am not exactly sure what. But I do know that I never see you anymore. Ever. I miss you dearly. You were one of my best friends. You ment more to me than I think you realize. I always feel like you hate me. You think I am this annoying thing that won't get out of your life. I am sorry if you think that, and I don't try to make you feel that way, if that is how you feel. I know you wonder why I don't make the effort to be your friend, if I do indeed miss you so much. The truth is, I did, I tried and I never felt you tried. I seemed to always call you and always ask you to hang out. Maybe I am wrong. But that is just how it seemed. After a while, I gave up. The worst part is when people come to me and say "i thought you guys were best friends, what happened?" I don't know what to say, I avoid it if possible. I don't know what happened, but I am sorry it did. I don't know what I want from you. Maybe nothing. Maybe an explanation. I am just tired of acting like nothing ever happened. Like we were never friends.

      you have no idea what it is like it is this horrible sensation always looming there no one knows well, only a select few anyway and what they know is more serious than they think you are never going to get it but maybe i am wrong maybe you will one day but by then it will be too late i will be dead or very much alive not by any help from you so instead of saying thanks i say no thanks because what you think is helping is really hurting and i hate you every last one of you but you are never going to get it no you aren't

Didn't you see me standing there?  Why did you turn out the lights?  Did you know that I was sleeping?   Say a prayer for me.  Help me to feel the strenght, I did.  My identity, has it been taken?  Is my heart breakin' on me?   All my plans fell thought my hands. They fell thought my hands on me.  All my dreams it suddenly seems. It suddenly seems. Empty.

      I remember the first time I saw Romeo and Juliet. I thought it was okay. I remember the second time I saw it. I cried so hard my chest hurt. I had a low. One hard to explain. The third time I watched it. I cried long, big sobs. The forth time. I was immune. I just sat there. You should watch it. It is genius. It makes you so angry yet so happy and so in love Oh, Romeo. My, Romeo.  RO-MAY-O. 'why then, is my pump well flowered?' leonardo... I must say you really pump my nads.

'having the time of my life' always there that is what you were change happens this I know but my question is this why is change always for the worst and the things we want to change never do they say everyone has changed even myself I do not know if I am better or worse but you certainly are not you the occasional glimpse that is all I get do you remember? perhaps shocked. that is what I was. such a quick transformation so quick that I didn't have time to stop it so quick that I didn't get a chance to breathe so quick I didn't get to tell you every last thing tell you everything  I wanted you to remember before you decided to die or maybe I have it all wrong maybe I am the one hiding because I was the one who died but if that is true and I am dead what does that make you? certainly not alive. certainly not.

      $650 in change found in man's stomach   JEFF DONN; The Associated Press   BOSTON- French doctors were taken aback when they discovered the reason for a patient's sore, swollen belly: He had swallowed around 350 coins - $650 worth - along with assorted necklaces and needles.   The 62-year-old man came to the emergency room ofCholet GeneralHospitalin westernFrancein 2002. He had a history of major psychiatric illness, was suffering from stomach pain, and could not eat or move his bowels.   His family warned doctors that he sometimes swallowed coins, and a few had been removed from his stomach in past hospital visits.   Still, doctors were awed when they took an X-ray. They discovered an enormous opaque mass in his stomach that turned out to weigh 12 pounds - as much as some bowling balls. It was so heavy it had forced his stomach down between his hips.   Five days after his arrival, doctors cut him open and removed his badly damaged stomach with its contents. He died 12 days later from complications.   One of his doctors, intensive care specialist Dr. Bruno Francois, said the patient had swallowed the coins - both French currency and later euros - over about a decade. His family tried to keep coins and jewelry away from him.   "When he was invited and came in some homes, he liked to steal coins and eat them," Francois said.   The case history of the French patient, whose name was withheld, was reported in today's New England Journal of Medicine.   The patient's rare condition is called pica, a compulsion to eat things not normally consumed as food. Its name comes from the Latin word for magpie, a bird thought to eat just about anything.   Pica can take the form of eating dirt, ashes, chalk, hair, soap, toothbrushes, burned matches and many other things. Francois once treated a patient who ate forks. Most such objects are small enough to pass on their own, but some must be removed by doctors.   The condition is perhaps best known in children and pregnant women but is also sometimes linked to psychiatric illness.   A few details of the Frenchman's case were presented Jan. 1 along with the X-ray - but no explanation of the stomach mass - as a challenge to New England Journal of Medicine readers in a fixture called "A Medical Mystery."   Dr. Lindsey Baden, an editor at the journal, reported that 666 readers in 73 countries - mostly doctors or doctors-in-training - contacted the journal to try to solve the mystery. Almost 90 percent settled on diagnoses consistent with pica, but only 8 percent correctly identified coins.   "This case serves as a reminder of important factors that should be considered in the care of patients who are mentally impaired,"Badenwrote.

      I saw you there that day now, I don't quite remember exactly when it happened maybe when that certain look was given at that certain moment . maybe it was when they knew before we did yes, I think that was it their certainty confirmed our ever exsisting wonder  red.blue.yellow swish swish. my jacket.  burning throats.  that ever-longing glance.  the glass had shattered. pieces were everwhere. not as easy as everyone thought.  sun sun sun. cigar.cigar. need. yearn.  "i hate the way i love you" i love the way i hate you i hate love the way i you i love you, way the hate 'the things we won't do for love'  everyday my circle cries everyday my thoughts die  head or heart?  . .. . .... .... .. . .. ........ ... . . . . . ... . . ..  she sits there, not moving hardly breathing heart growing then shrinking her thoughts are blank her absence is only physical you come to find how her absence has been perfected she watches you with her eyes, expectance rising in her heart, she waits, silent spirit grows deep within her shaking palms, her eyes meet yours, no longer is her spirit there, it is suddenly taken over by a wave of shame for ever hoping, her eyes turn to puddles reflecting the silent dreams she had for this very moment. as you look into her soul with your x-ray vision of destruction you let out a small laugh. ruin her.  i am sorry. i am so very sorry.  so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry. so sorry.  all that she needed. so sorry.

      he noticed. he is my teacher. you don't. if you do, anyway. you remain quite quiet.  the realization that you have no power is a hard thing to take to understand you think that you know what is right for you for her for him and to find out all your efforts mean nothing can be damaging  there is that feeling again of losing everything and gaining what you don't want  what do i want? love? hate? anger? you?  Wait they don't love you like i love you. Wait they don't love you like i love you.  I changed because I was tired of being like you. You stayed the same. I crave the you I used to be. I crave the me I used to be of you. funny how things work. .. .out  bright green pants really steal my fancy  books about impossible love shatter me yet, envelope me with fantasy  mull. et. mull. over. pull. over.  sail away, sail away, sail away.

       she walks into the room she feels naked in her cacoon of secrets lost to the world of reality she tapes up her smile records her casual conversation her mind floats between between love and want she makes her way across the room full of mixed drinks and mixed emotions five jagged steps later she collapses into the unsuspecting arms of her past lover eye contact waves over in her blank stare there is suddenly a burst of memory his face makes his way through the depths of her bad dreams with her hateful hands and betrayed lips she draws him near she kisses him a knowing kiss a lating hove kiss she leans her head back and once again looks within his eyes while regret drips from her eyes her hand slides from his body unknowingly she makes her way back through the door through the hallway she crouches alone on the stairs waiting for another unfortunate lover another love hidden inside infatuation

      today ellen and i were walking towards her sisters car I didn't have a particularly bad day the sun was shining always provides a smile but there sitting on the hood of her sisters hood i realized why i had been feeling distressed and awkward today was no ordinary sunny day while most of you found no difference, for me every minute of the day held signifigance I fell so happy I could burst but at the same time i felt I was missing out on something today was a day for my soul mate and me today held memory in every blink today i yearned for the one I love today i lost the one I love today i found that my soul mate exists there was something strange in the air today I couldn't explain it to ellen in everyway that it was fluttering through my brain i wanted to devour everyone in the beauty I felt yet i wanted to break down in my sorrow  while I know I sound ridiculous and you probably are thinking I am surely absurd  I most likely am but something about the sun today gave me an overwhelming feeling

      There're no words to say   No words to convey   This feeling inside I have for you   Deep in my heart  Save from the guards   Of intellect and reason  Leaving me at a loss   For words to express my feelings  Deep in my heart   Look at me losing control   Thinking I had a hold  But with feelings this strong   I'm no longer the master   Of my emotions

      There's no need to argue anymore.  I gave all I could, but it left me so sore.  And the thing that makes me mad,  Is the one thing that I had,   I knew, I knew,  I'd lose you.  You'll always be special to me,  Special to me, to me.   And I remember all the things we once shared,  Watching T.V. movies on the living room armchair.  But they say it will work out fine.  Was it all a waste of time?   'Cause I knew, I knew,  I'd lose you.  You'll always be special to me,  Special to me, to me.   Will I forget in time,   You said I was on your mind?  There's no need to argue,  No need to argue anymore.  There's no need to argue anymore.

SMALL MEDIUM LARGE  .tears.   why is it that when everything is going ok boooooom i am hit with a blow so big i can't function my brain is moving too fast it is so tired so very tired         .,...,,.,,.,.,.,.,,,..,,,..,,., i am tired of missing missing so much and not being missed back is it pathetic to want to be missed? yes.     >insert gnarly guitar solo here  that was BLISS BABY  man can that guy WAIL whale? yes.     i am counting UFO's.

      you shouldn't say things like that to someone like me you should know that no, actually you shouldn't but  i wish you would have said nothing nothing doesn't keep me up at night nothing doesn't turn me upside down            so, what is the deal with that bizness? buzz.buzz.         i watched adaptation i loved it more than i can explain 'life is composed of what you love, not what loves you'       i saw you watching me through your secret window we winked a knowing wink cause that is what we do. no speaking. no acting as if we have ever met. simply a wink. do you like these winks? i no longer wish for this secret window.     so you wrote me back it had been so long you gave me advice i like you you are so mysterious yet i know you when are you going to send me on a grand adventure? another task perhaps? sorry i failed the first mission. you know i tried.

      recently. i have been feeling like a horrid person. and i would like to openly apologize to every person. i know it won't mean what it should. but i ought to be said.  who first?  Dear ******,   I am sorry. For anything I ever did to make you doubt. You are my love. You know this. My soul sista, as we used to put it.   Dear ******,   I am sorry. For not loving you the way you love me. I am sorry. That you can't be around me anymore. I miss you often. I hate that I turn your mood sour. I never ment to do so. Someday, when our love is equal, we shall make sandwiches that are godly and dance along to run dmc sounding from your blaster of ghetto.  Dear ****,   I am sorry. For not being a good person to you. Although we will always have differences, and I know we will never be as we used to. I treated you with the ut-most disrespect, that which you did not deserve. I will always have my thoughts about you and you for me. but i do wish you to know. that I cherish you as someone who understands the tangle that is me. always picking up where we left off. never time for discomfort. this apology doesn't deserve to be accepted, for it is too late. but i want it to be said. i am always up for sober fun with you. i am always up to chat for hours with a coffee in my hand. you mind is a web i don't understand, and never will, but that i have grown to understand. so now all that is left. is to say, you deserve love. more than many people i know. and i do hope you find it. and i hope that that person loves you. these things ought to be said. they ought to.  Dear *********,   I am sorry. For ever allowing you to leave my life the way you have. I am sorry that you felt you weren't good enough. when really perhaps you were just too good and there wasn't enough of you to be shared with me. I check up on you often. I ask people how you are. Happy i have heard as of late. always good to hear. I miss you every day. I often think about calling you, but I feel it is too late. I know you are probably laughing at this. thinking that I don't really care. but I do. whether you think so or not. and. I guess all I want to say is. you are wonderful. and. a mystery to me. remain happy my dear, it suits you beautifully.   Dear *****,   I am sorry. For letting you slip so far away. I am sorry that I wasn't good enough. You know that i love you. and. my friend you shall always be. I am sorry you lost your spark. I hope that someday soon you will find it. on that day. I shall tell you the secret of schmidt and you will understand the stub.  Dear you, and you , and you,   I am sorry.       if you only knew how my heart swells.  leave not room for regret.  things just might unfuck themselves.  today I want to meet you.  our soberness will envelope us.  and our understanding.  will make us love.

DOCTOR is there nothing I can take? i said DOCTOR to relieve this belly ache.                  come on. just come on. come on *****.  you fucked up so monsterously that the thought of your face increases the chance of vomiting  woo, i would hate to be wearing your shoes, bitch.            shake you butt. like a stupid slut.   like a stupid  slut .

      everything seems to have  fallin apart at the seeeeeeeems?seams?  yet  put itself together again  but the pieces don't fit  no no no  fitting is not what they are doing . god damn . why won't they just fit .maybe.  just for a week?            the more I try to be a better person the more I fail.         listening to her cry. made my heart hurt. i am sorry.       i sat on your roof that morning. all alone. the sky was turning pink, but still blue. that between period right before the sun. appears. my shooting star no longer able to be seen.  i wanted to call someone. have them rescue me from my content loneliness.  instead i crawled back through the window back into your bed back into your arms because you can't escape reality because you will never know what you want and nothing will ever be perfect.                can't go a lookin for good conversation.   well this mood is unfortunate.                           donut kisses.                               i said i didn't need you anymore. i ment i didn't need you anymore. i don't feel the way you think. you are a poor unfortunate soul.
