      Jamie, I hope your finals went well.  I hated studying for them, but then when they are over you feel so good :)   Dont be inspired by me...I feel bad for the people that have been here for over a year, it must be very hard for them.  CNN's views are pretty accurate.  There are quite a few IEDs and car bombs.  I think the toughest part is trying to always be alert and ready.  After a while, it gets tiring and that is when people let their gaurd down.  Things are definately improving though.  Just last year people were telling me that they were sleeping in the terminals of the airport on cots with no AC and going to the bathroom in a ditch outside.  Now, every tent has AC and port-a-potties, and a dining facility where we get meals...it really isnt that bad.  Just think of it like camp but you always have to carry a weapon :) Good luck with finishing out school. Love ya,    Hi all, Just a little update on how things are going.  I was able to see Hope, a good friend, today who is also in Baghdad so that made my day.  On Friday I am still moving to a small camp between Baghdad and Karbala so I will have a change of scenery.  I really like the other LTs in my company, which is a very good thing, but I am not so sure about my commander.  He seems afraid of standing up for his soldiers and I think he feels inadequate around the combat arms officers (he is MI).  Maybe he doesnt feel manly enough, who knows.  But, needless to say he is not very good and he always tasks things out which makes you wonder what he does all day.  During the day it is getting hot already, but the night is pleasant and I sleep really well, which is a bonus.  Last night there was a cat stuck between the sandbags around our tent and the actual tent.  It made the worst noises...but it was funny because I think some guys from the next tent got so sick of the noise and solved the problem  (all I know is we heard voices and then the cat stopped--who knows what they did).  Yesterday we also ran into an Iraqi car in a parking lot with a HUMVEE, which was humerous.  We were backing up in a hurry and then bam...the alarm went off and he all started to giggle.  We were both parked in no parking zones.  One of the people in the car got out and we exchanged information and told them to call civil affairs...I bet the guy never sees a cent :) But, in a nutshell life is good and then showers are still hot :) Love you all and take care.

      heyy...      I just wanted to thank you for being such a great TA this semester. sorry for missing so many sections, it wasn't because they were boring, it was because I'm afraid of the SciLi elevator. that thing shakes like a bitch. but did you notice my attendance improved after the advent of the nipple ring? anyway, thanks for being so fun and awesome, and making what could have been a painfully dull section into something I enjoyed. we were all disappointed when you missed the last section, and we even stayed for a half hour waiting for you because it was the last section. good luck with whatever you do over the summer, if you're ever in DC let me know, and we can drink straight vodka out of a straw together.

      Letter requested by Dean XXX XXXXX  Two of my primary goals have always been to be healthy and to be able to comfortably support a family. These goals can obviously be achieved in any number of ways. I, and my family as well, have always stressed the importance of learning as a means in achieving those goals. This semester I have taken a particular liking to my classes, and all revolve around various literatures. In French and Comparative Literature I am able to read cannons that perhaps cannot fully transcend the language barrier, and in my English class I can appreciate many of the great authors I used to only recognize by name. Perhaps these interests will propel me into a carrier as a teacher; perhaps they will simply leave me searching, like a 19th century po√®te maudit, uncompromisingly for my own place in this world. (I hope law school isn't too expensive!). To what extent are my personal choices supporting my goals? Last year I don't think they did very much. I can see now how detrimental my decisions were, how foolish and juvenile, and the severity of my current predicament. A person I believe to be wise once told me that, when coupled with youth, he could stand stupidity, even possibly excuse it. It was stupidity in adulthood for which he had no tolerance. I feel now that I have exhausted both this tolerance and this excuse and can attest to having grown up. I will attempt to conform all my future decisions with my personal goals. In such a small environment as a dorm or a classroom, my actions are very much magnified and have a tremendous impact on my community. And if these actions attract the attention of DPS, they impact my community even more. I will not say that I made no good decisions last semester, but they had, unfortunately, far less impact on my community than my bad ones did. The actions that prompted this essay had a negative impact on those around me in all my communities at school, at home, even in my own room. I have spent too many nights waiting with baited breath for a letter from the Office of Student Life to not have aged. I understand the severity of my punishment and the predicament my status as a student is in. It has gotten to the point where it is impossible to fully concentrate on anything else. Always on my mind is this worry, as it should be. On my toes I am my own best ally. I hope to be off this probationary period soon, so that I can go about without living with this fear. But for the time being I will use the scrutiny being placed upon me by the disciplinary deans as a motivator, and not as anything else. I am sorry for my transgressions in the last year. They displayed disregard for the rules in this community, rules that must be adhered to.  I have familiarized myself with the rules governing most practices at the university, and am making a conscious effort to obey them all. Thank you, XXXXX '06

      I made it to Baghdad two nights ago at around 130 in the morning.  The flight was good and uneventful.  We are living in tents and using Port-A-Potties, but there is hot water in the showers, so I cant complain.  I will be taking over a platoon next week and will be moving south.  The PL now is a girl who is really cool.  We get along really well.  The camp (Camp Chosin) is not as nice, so I probably will not have access to internet.  They are always improving the living conditions, but it guess down there it is still pretty bad.  I will be with a bunch of infantry guys, so that should be interesting (sorry Adam).  I guess I will be one of the only females, so that should be interesting.  I met some of the guys in my platoon (again all male), and they seem fun.  It is starting to get hot out with is not so fun, but all of the tents have air conditioning, which is very nice.  I have a new address for you guys...it is:  PS If you have a min could you please send me powdered drink mixes, Crystal Light (Grapefruit), Gatoraid, Kool Aid and magazines.  Thanks you guys are the best. Have a good night and I will try to write again as soon as possible.

      XXXXXX,  I am sorry, but my feelings were really hurt this evening.  I have been calling you all week to no avail.  I know you don't return calls, etc. and that's just fine.  You said you'd call me in an hour that one evening and maybe even stop by for a cigarette.  So you didn't have time to come by, but you could have called to let me know. I know that you lead a busy life and won't always have time to hang out with me and let me know how things are going for you.  The only thing is that when you clearly have time for other friends, I am inevitably left feeling like a very low priority to you.  I should hope that your family and girlfriend are a far greater priority than I am.  I should hope that XXXXXX is not.  I called your room and your cell phone tonight to see if you wanted to have dinner.  Perhaps you didn't get the messages, perhaps you did.  Either way, to run into you and then learn of your plans tonight that showed no genuine interest in seeing me (when you clearly had the time) made me feel like shit.  I hope you think that I am overly sensitive, because I am.  Look, I'm easy going and laid back most of the time, but when I care, I'll let you know.  Quite frankly, I'm insulted that you...

      Prof. SCY thinks I have a good chance of getting a B.  Would anyone like to re-raise him before the flop?   Hi! Benjamin,  For a large class, the median and the mean will be very close, so as a rough guideline for setting the borders, either one will do.  At this point , I would say that your chance of getting a B is pretty good. You can do the math as well as I do. I have provided all the information I could for you to do your estimates.   Best,  SCY

      I can't believe the American Heart Assocation funded my project after I wrote this in the application:  HOW WILL THIS EXPERIENCE CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR CAREER PLANS?  As a Cardiac EMT with over 3 three years of experience working in pre-hospital emergency care, I have seen first-hand the far-reaching effects of cardiovascular disease.  I am currently pursuing undergraduate studies in biology with an immunology focus.  The cellular and molecular origins of human disease processes fascinate me.  The relatively new idea that chronic inflammation and innate immunity contribute to atherosclerosis has major implications for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  My desire to study atherogenesis in the context of immune modulation stems from my dual interest in clinical medicine and basic science research.  I hope to further both of these interests by attending a combined MD/Ph.D. program after completing my undergraduate studies.  The proposed project is geared towards my career interest in cardiovascular disease, pediatrics, and immunology, making it an ideal summer opportunity for me.

      Josh,  Here‚Äôs some poker advice.   Myself and Gideon are tight-aggressive players. We‚Äôre not afraid to bet big or call a big bet if we think we have the best hand before the flop. We bluff occasionally.  You are a loose player. You bluff at a lot of pots, you draw at a lot of hands, and you play a lot of pots. This has enabled you to have some success and some disappointment. I don‚Äôt suggest you change your style to become a tight-aggressive player. It so happens that you tend to play well against myself and Gideon because we will lay down our hand on a bluff.  Mr. Eric Noble is something of a rock. He will try to limp in to catch a flop. You cannot bluff at him in that situation, because if you do he will call you up if he has anything. Noble actually is a pretty good player; he made a number of good laydowns against me. When it looks like the other player probably has him beat, he will lay down a hand on the river. The reason this doesn‚Äôt hurt him is that he usually has not raised before the flop so doesn‚Äôt have very much money in the flop to begin with.  When it comes around to him in any position, he will value bet his hand. He is easy to read this way, that‚Äôs why he can be played with. For instance, Eric once had 8-8 before the cut (before the cut is the position to right of the dealer button). Instead of raising, as I would do with a pocket pair, Eric choose to limp in. He had position on me and I had the A-J.  The flop came down A-8-7 rainbow (no flush draw). I bet a dollar to see where I was. When Eric reraised me instead of just smooth calling, I knew he had flopped trips, because an amateur player will always value bet that hand. I threw away top pair right after he bet, knowing I was probably beat.  If he limps in, make him pay to see a flop. When 3 or more people have folded and he limps in, raise unless you have a monster (A-A, K-K, etc). He will probably fold right then unless he has a huge hand. For a dollar, dollar-fifty, you have a great idea of what cards he might have. If the flop comes, you can decide to bet or check depending on what you read him as having. You can‚Äôt outplay somebody after the flop if you don‚Äôt know what they have.  When he bets, and you also have a hand, you‚Äôre probably going to have to have the nuts or close to it. If you reraise, he will call you down because he doesn‚Äôt know any better.  Often, Eric will make a bet of fifty cents to go. This is a weak bet and must be called or raised depending on your read.  I bluffed at Eric once last night, and when I did, it went bad for me. I bluffed at Hubbard non-stop and broke him. Inexperienced players come in all different shades, but if you‚Äôre going to bluff, make sure you have a good idea of what you‚Äôre bluffing at.   Let me refer to the infamous flush-hand now. I don‚Äôt remember what you had when I hit the flush, but I know it was damn sure better than what I had to start, the 5-3 of clubs. That‚Äôs a hand I like to limp in with to see if I can catch a draw. If you had a made hand on the flop, you should have made me pay to hit my draw. If you had made it 5 dollars to go before that river card came, I would have folded because my pot odds would not have been right. It‚Äôs often better to win a small pot now than a big pot later if your opponent may be drawing to a hand that would beat you. Another thing is that when you are drawing, you want to be drawing to the best possible hand. That way, you avoid the worst case scenario-you hit your draw and make a huge bet, just as your opponent has hit an even bigger draw.  Poker books are fun to read.  Alex

      FEMALE PRAYER:    Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray for a man who's not a creep.   One who's handsome, smart & strong.   One who loves to listen long.   One who thinks before he speaks.   When he says he'll call, he won't wait weeks.   I pray that he is gainfully employed.   When I spend his cash he won't be annoyed.   Pulls out my chair and opens my door.   Massages my back & begs to do more.   Oh! Send me a man who'll make love to my mind,   Knows what to answer to "How big is my behind?"   I pray that this man will love me to no end,   And never attempt to hit on my friend. Amen.       MALE PRAYER    I pray for a deaf-mute nymphomaniac with huge breasts   who owns a liquor store & a boat.  Amen.

      George Clooney 'bravo' for Italians Actor enjoying time in home away from home Monday, July 12, 2004 Posted: 2:48 PM EDT (1848 GMT)   LAGLIO, Italy (AP) -- George Clooney shoots baskets with the local kids, carries grandmothers' groceries uphill and works hard on pronouncing "buon giorno."  He has international stardom and rascally good looks, but in this hamlet where Clooney owns an 18th century mansion with a private dock on Lake Como, the star is simply "bravo" -- Italian for "a good person."  Sure, the fans pitching tents outside Villa Oleandra are a nuisance, but locals say they don't mind the extra business their celebrity neighbor has generated since he bought the mansion two years ago.  "He's good and kind with everyone. All you have to do is not intrude on him," said Giordano Saibene, sunning himself on a narrow stone ledge with a view of the pine-shaded villa.  Intruding may include snapping photos -- Saibene said Clooney's bodyguards once threw apples at a fan who was trying to take a picture of the villa.  On a recent lazy July day, word was out that Clooney wasn't in town. So Laglio, surrounded by forested foothills stretching toward the Alps and Switzerland, was enjoying a respite from celebrity watchers.   Only a few days earlier, however, star-watching was at a fever pitch as fans searched for a glimpse not only of Clooney, but his co-stars in "Ocean's Seventeen," which was wrapping up filming in Italy. Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Lucy ----, Jake ----, Gideon "Zeus" Friedman, Rachael "Doc" Bedard, and Josh "Ice" Brau are in the sequel to 2001's "Ocean's Eleven," which is a remake of a the 1960 Frank Sinatra movie.   "Everyone was outside the villa. Old ladies and entire families. There were even those who slept in their car. It was a pilgrimage," said Nearco Folloni, owner of Laglio's Lanterna bar.  Pitt liked to tool around in a rented motorboat, said Daniele Riva, whose family boatyard provided it. Riva said local authorities asked that boats not be rented "to the curious" who might disturb the stars at play. The Rivas, who have built boats for five generations for the rich who summer in Laglio, obliged.  Mariuccia Riva, Daniele's mother, said she first came across Clooney when he had locked himself out of the villa. Since then, he always tells her good morning.  "He says it like this, 'Buon giorno, signora,' " Mrs. Riva said, opening her mouth wide and rolling the vowels in an exaggerated imitation of Clooney's efforts to pronounce Italian.  Clooney is known for hopping into the boat with a white convertible top that he keeps at his dock, zipping guests across the lake to dine in other towns.  A Como newspaper published an appeal by Laglio's Catholic pastor, pleading to fans to leave Clooney in peace, saying Laglio's "tranquility" is its main selling point.  But Folloni contended celebrity is good for business: "Before, Laglio wasn't on the map. Now it is and we like that."  Townspeople say they have an easy relationship with Clooney.  "Maybe because none of us ever bothered him, he would invite us" to join him on a public basketball court, said Saibene.  Clooney would pedal the few miles to the court on his mountain bike, a basketball in his backpack.  The actor was cycling one morning when he saw Saibene's 75-year-old grandmother trudging home with bags of milk, bread and other groceries and carried them for her.  "This man in a cap and dark glasses stopped and asked if he could help. She thought he was an American tourist," Saibene said. "She doesn't watch TV because she's in bed by 8 o'clock. She has hens and chicks to tend to."

      July 18th at 10:30pm ET    Ali G Goes Ivy League    2004 Harvard University Commencement Speech   "Booyakasha - Professor G indahouse aiii. Big shout out de Harvard massiv [THROW UP 'H'] I iz done a capital 'H', coz Harvard iz a place innit - u see I ain't no ignoranus. Things like 'apple' and 'orange' do not start with a capital letter, unless dey iz at de start of a sentence - but some of you brainboxes probably know dat already innit. Me name be Ali G and me represent de UK [DO SIGNS]. For those of u who didn't study geography de UK is a place over a 100 MILES away from here, de capital of it is? Anyone? Not u geography square! ....yes, it is Liverpool. U iz clever and quite fly if u don't mind me sayin. First of all, I iz got to say I iz a bit nervous speakin to so many of you - at least me would be if I weren't totally mashed. Normally de only public-speaking I does is to 12 people - and it's well easy all me has to say iz me name and de words 'not guilty'.   Checkit, me agreed to speak here today coz me wanted to talk to de brightest minds of our generation, to see what makes Harvard de most special university in de world, and also coz dey agreed to pay for me flight over here and hotel room. Sorry to bring dis up now, but when u iz told dat your hotel bill is bein paid for, u naturally assume dat dat includes essential extras like breakfast AND special interest pay-per-view movies. Imagine my surprise den dis morning, when I was given a bill for $164. Me was actually tryin to SAVE Harvard money by buying the 24-hour 'slutfest' packages at $19.99, rather dan paying for individual films at $11.99 each. Which would have cost u - [go thru them] Young and Tight....Backdoor Burglar 2......Backdoor Burglar 3.....Campus Confessions....Asian Fever...Shaven Buffet [get lost] twice dat one... Cold Mountain - dat was a mistake, Backdoor Burglar 4 ....almost 490 bucks. I mean come on, some of it was even research for dis, I iz sure one of de cheerleaders in 'Ivy League Amateurs' was wearin a Harvard sweatshirt.....infact...[TAKE OFF GLASSES] allo darlin, respek - I expect u need a cushion to sit on, aiii.   Anyways I digest. It iz a well big honour to be arksed ere today. To fink dat so many great people has been educated ere like Lyndon Banes Johnson, or as he is better known - JFK, George Clinton was also ere I fink , and de one before him, and also...William Tell - is he one of your lot, probably, and dat bloke wiv de hat, but most importantly dat really fit honey from Star Wars - if u iz out dere, me'd love to - me iz stayin at de Best Western Hotel - me's got a really nice room, altho since dis morning dem has put a parental lock on de tv.   As I stand here today lookin at all of you, on this, your first day of university - I fink of all de fings me can offer you - wisdom, experience but most importantly of all 22 ounces of de finest Morrocan chronic. Well, Dat iz if de Ex-Lax works - to be honest I usually go at 11 in de morning - but nothing dere - infact me'd appreciate it if one medical students here wouldn't mind takin a look. Don't worry it's clean as a whistle, u could eat your lunch of it - infact meJulie has. [TAKE OFF GLASSES] I know u don't mind dat kind of fing does u.   Hearmenow, u iz de most cleverest students in America - some of u iz probably brilliant at counting - ye know...1,2,3...4.... I could continue...easy. Others of u will be brilliant at English - have memorised de whole alphabet 'a to x' and even be able to spell words like 'hippototamus'.   I iz also well clever - me was so brainy dat me finished me education 6 years before any of u - at de age of 15 - de teachers had to admit dat dere was nothing else dat dem could teach me. U students has come from every corner of de US from de rainforests of Arizona to de deserts of Alaska. Some of you iz probably never even seen a black man before.......allo   Dere is all types of people ere, and it's fantastic to see dat Harvard has finally let in so many women. A lot of u iz probably feminists or as we call dem in England 'lezzas'. I agree wiv u, dat u gotta treat women wiv respec - its de least dat bitches deserve.   Relationships should be brought into dis -de 20th centrury - u women out dere shouldn't have to do de cookin and de cleanin when u come home from work - u should do it before u leave in de morning.   But more importantly it's wikid dat in Harvard young women and men gets to learn so many amazing subjects.   Some of u here will have been studying medicine...dat knowledge come wiv a lot of responsibilities. Remember, doctors is some of de most powerfulest people in de world - u can give life, u can cure disease and u can ask to see a woman's [whistle] wivout getting slapped.   For those of u studying history, u probably learnt a lot about de Presidents. Like who was Jefferson, and what did Lincoln give America - apart from de town car.   Some of u iz de best legal students in de country. U would know wivout even thinking, how to get someone off a charge of possession. And if any of u do, then can me remind u - Room 204 at the Best Western. Just do me a favour put your ear to de door, and don't come in if u hears me shouting 'Natalie, play wiv me light saber'.   Let's talk about de finances of all dat k-nowledge dat's been dropped on u. It costs $38000 a year to go to Harvard. Now I don't know how u lot has earnt dat - [TO PORN STAR] apart from u - and u iz earnt every penny, but most of u iz got dat cash from your parents.   All you fathers out dere u iz made choices - wiv dat money u could have bought top of de range Lexus but instead u chose to invest in ya kids future. IZ U MENTAL? If u iz got other kids me hopes u don't make de same mistake again innit. Does u realise how many honeys u can get wiv a Lex. 'allo sweetness my son's got a Harvard degree' [FEMALE VOICE] 'wot, who cares'   Or [CAR NOISE, WINDOW DOWN, ELBOW OUT] allo darlin, wanna check out de dvd player in de back aiii.' [her] 'wot's dat?' [me] 'it's ostrich leather' [MIME BLOWJOB]. So students give it up for your parents.   Let's talk bout de future - your future. A lot of you iz probably worried bout employment. Unfortunately most of u WILL end up gettin jobs - especially now u iz got de burden of a degree.   You iz de elite, u will be tomorrow's captains of industry. Sittin infront of me is probly da next Bill Gates, Donald Trump...or even Ronald Mcdonald. And even if you can't all be Ronald himself, most of you iz probably McDonald's Team Leader material. By da way, if any of u ever gets to do business wiv Sir Ronald, a word of hadvice - don't mention de size of his feet....him iz well sensitive about it. Me mate Dave hactually met him, and he said dat even tho him may seem like he's always smiling, dere's a sadness in de eyes...coz of dem feet. All de money in de world - and science still can't do nothing. Maybe dat's something dat some of u M.I.T. nerds can fink about innit.   You lot will become powerful people who can change de future - and you need to, coz de world at de moment iz totally f-blank-blank-blank-ucked. Yeknow de word - I been told I ain't allowed to say it - u know [MIME FUCKING] - u know de rude word. U know [MIME FINGER SEX]. [TO PORN STAR] U definitely know...wiv de whole team.   Anyhow, u iz gotta fink bout de problems in de world coz u iz gotta sort dem out innit. Look at da envirolment - global warming is so bad, dey say in 100 years time, all de rainforests will be gone and all de ice caps will have melted. Actually, 100 years time, we ain't gonna be around den, so don't need to worry about dat one.   But dere is other fings - look at de state of family today - girls is havin sex at younger ages, dere's an increase in absentee fathers and more and more people is havin affairs - but we shouldn't just concentrate on de good fings. Believing in something is easy. Actually doing something is harder. Actions speak louder dan birds.   U has all got de potential to become great americans. And remember America is de greatest country in de whole world ...apart from Jamaica...and Holland.. oh yeah and Thailand coz u got dose girls who do all de ye know [pop sound] and probly some others - but u iz definitely in de top 20. ?U people iz de future, u has de chance to change de world, to hactually improve de life of de poor, OR U could goto Wall Street and earn millionz - get plasma screen, chinchilla coat, a series of relationships wiv gold-digging hoes happy to de de most disgusting sexual favours for some bling. Don't waste de opportunity dat g-d has given you - see u in Wall Street.   Let's rap dis up now, coz I fink me feels somethin movin down below. So, what iz I hopin to take away wiv me from dis time in Harvard? - new friends, different ways of finking about de world, and as many laptops as me mate Dave has managed to nick from your dorms, while u has been sitting ere listening to me stalling.   But I has got ideals too. Just like de great civil rights leader Martin Luther...Van Dross, I has a dream...of little black girls and little white girls...playin wiv each other. Let's make it happen I look out and I see 1000s of people wiv different hopes and different dreams - but it is important never to forget where u all came from - becoz black, white, brown or pakistani we all come from de same place - de punani. Jah bless - bigupyaself Princeton...and keep it real... wesside."

      [Three case reports of breast abscess after nipple piercing: underestimated health problems of a fashion phenomenon]  [Article in German]  Jacobs VR, Golombeck K, Jonat W, Kiechle M.  Frauenklinik, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany. volker.jacobs@hotmail.com  OBJECTIVE: Piercing is a growing fashion trend among young people. Nipple piercing has shown an increase over the last years. We report about three coincidental cases of breast abscess after nipple piercing within the last months in our clinics and discuss the related problems for health and society. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of three case reports regarding course of illness and reasons as well as review of literature and internet. RESULTS: Three patients average age 31.9 (28-35) years were hospitalized with breast abscess after nipple piercing (2 x left, 1 x right). The distance piercing to infection was on average 7.7 (5-12) months. In all patients the abscess was incised and the abscess cavity removed, two had an irrigation tubing for a three days, all received i. v. antibiotics postoperatively. Evidence for bacteria was found in case 1: PCR-confirmation of atypical mycobacteria and coagulase negative staphylococcus, case 2: coagulase negative staphylococcus and group B-streptococcus and case 3: green and microaerophilic staphylococcus. The length of hospital stay was on average 8.0 (6-9) days/case, the hospital costs were 3 624,54 e (3 000,26-4 310,58 e) euro;/case. In a follow-up period of 10,0 (5-15) months one relapse occurred which had to be re-operated.  CONCLUSION: Nipple piercing has grown in popularity within the last years and is in general not a stigma of a subculture or lower social classes any more.  However, the risk for breast infection is on the one hand underestimated by the women and on the other hand played down by piercing studios. Breast infection after nipple piercing is rarely documented in scientific literature and data bases. Only seven case reports are scientifically published so far. Healing of the wound channel varies and can take up to 6-12 months. The risk for infection is approximately 10-20 %, often in a interval of months after the procedure. Insufficient understanding as well as inconsequent performance of hygienic preparation of the wound beneath  other risk factors like nicotine abuse , wrongs size of jewelry, post breast enlargement with prosthesis etc. increase the risk of breast infection after nipple piercing. Due to obvious under documentation this is the largest series of breast infection after nipple piercing in the world.

      To the Editor: A healthy 20-year-old woman presented with breast pain and bilateral purulent nipple discharge three weeks after having her nipples pierced. She received a course of antibiotics (cephalexin), and her infection resolved. Two weeks later, she returned because of bilateral spontaneous galactorrhea. Evaluation at that time showed a prolactin level of 218 ¬µg per liter, with a negative urine test for pregnancy and normal concentrations of serum thyrotropin (0.22 ¬µU per milliliter), blood urea nitrogen (8 mg per deciliter [2.9 mmol per liter]), and serum creatinine (0.6 mg per deciliter [53 ¬µmol per liter]). Three weeks later, the patient noted a decrease in galactorrhea; her prolactin level was 82.7 ¬µg per liter. Two months later, she became pregnant and had an uneventful termination of the pregnancy. Her menses remained normal throughout this time, except during the pregnancy. Two months after the pregnancy, she had the nipple rings removed, and she has had no further galactorrhea. By a month after the removal of the rings, her prolactin level had returned to normal, at 11.3 ¬µg per liter. Since cephalexin therapy was completed, the patient has not received any medications. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary was normal.   This young woman had a dramatic increase in prolactin and associated galactorrhea that coincided with the placement of bilateral nipple rings. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine1 notes that hyperprolactinemia in which the prolactin level is greater than 100 ¬µg per liter "almost invariably is indicative of a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma." Williams Textbook of Endocrinology2 comments that "a single prolactin measurement may be sufficient to diagnose a prolactinoma if the value is greater than 200 ¬µg [per liter]." The online version of UpToDate3 notes that serum prolactin concentrations "may increase slightly," reaching the range of 21 to 40 ¬µg per liter, with "intense breast stimulation" and that serum prolactin values above 200 ¬µg per liter "usually indicate the presence of a lactotroph adenoma." In an older study,4 nipple stimulation did not elevate serum prolactin levels in nonlactating women. Other studies have shown lower levels of hyperprolactinemia (less than four times the upper limit of normal) even with the intense stimulation of afferent pathways from severe chest burns or rib fracture or immediately after thoracotomy.5 In the case we report, marked hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level, >200 ¬µg per liter) was associated with the intense stimulation of nipple rings (probably with the added stimulation of the associated infections), and the prolactin level returned to normal with removal of the rings.

      Dean T,   I am a little unclear about this deduction business.  What "benefits" must be provided by the University that they reduce student stipends?  I am a little bothered by a potential 10% reduction, since I went through the trouble of getting outside funding.  My feelings are hurt that Brown would chip away at a stipend.  It's not like I got an NIH grant that included institutional support.  Is there any way the AHA could re-issue a check directly to me with your approval?  If student payroll wants to dock me, I am prepared to challenge them directly.  I am sorry to be such a miser about this, but I can't tell you how frustrating this whole thing has been.  Let me know what I can do.  Again, I am sorry to make trouble for you.   Jamie

At this point, I owe money to Stonehenge Properties, Chase, CapitalOne, BananaReupublic, Res Life, my brother, my father, and Alan Greenspan.  In other words, I'll take what I can get.  2 installments are better than none.   J

      Hello! I hope your summer is going well! There seems to be some problem with my email so in the case you haven‚Äôt received your comments from the final paper, here they are.  Dr. -----‚Äôs are attached and I have typed Dr. Goldstein‚Äôs in. Good luck with what you are doing! It was a pleasure having you in the class and I hope you enjoyed it as well.  Dr. Goldstein: Nice writing. WHy the AIDS patient? Why not keept he whole lying confusion in the ER. I liked the opening, but felt you gave up the pace and grew sentimental. What's the messageof the 3 voices united?  June 4, 2004   Benjamin (Jamie) Gallan  Thank you for your narrative that shows three views of the episode with the knife injury.  You succeeded in capturing the events and in presenting multiple perspectives and I found the story entertaining.  There were some difficulties, however in that the versions did not seem sufficiently distinct from one another either in voice or tone. In addition, some of the language appears a bit inappropriate for the speakers where the modeling may be more reflective of their background and educational levels and cognitive models, as well as their emotive states.  The mystery of the wound remains unanswered and there is likely room to increase some of the drama by adding a further creative layer.   Thank you for your contributions during the course of the class and I encourage you to continue to write.  This piece could use a little more work but I believe that you will be able to find your voice if you continue to write.  Thank you, particularly for your contributions regarding improving the class.  Good luck next year! Dr. ------

You are the 122nd member to finish this training and you have put us at 50% of the team having completed the DMAT Core.  By completing the training, you have finished one of the requirements to be deployable and moved us on our way to meeting this next goal.  Feel free to move on to the DMAT Advanced training.
