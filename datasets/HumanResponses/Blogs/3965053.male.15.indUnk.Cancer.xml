        if you've played  prince of persia  (if you have not,  i don't know how you're still functioning as a human being), you know that the music from the game is quite exceptional and can make you downright emotional when you remember all those cutscenes and puzzles and battles and romance and - i'm getting worked up right now.    if you're up for the 65mb, here is the zip file containing all 14 in-game tracks.  urlLink http://www.teapartydreams.com/modules/Downloads/downloadfiles/PrinceOfPersia.zip    wow, those are good times.   wow, those are good times factor ..::.. 100% out of 10

      with  ninja gaiden 's  xbox-live  only, totally free&nbsp;expansion coming in early august, along with the&nbsp;second  master ninja tournament ,  tomonobu itagaki  - the creator of the game - is doing plenty of interviews and other press-related events with giddy and anxious game journalists. most of these&nbsp;meetings have&nbsp;established what will come with the pack - new camera system, two new costumes, new enemies, a new weapon, and an "action system". but  ign.com 's   interview had the single greatest question and answer i have ever seen for  ninja gaiden.   &nbsp;   "IGN : What do you say to those lesser gamers who complain that  Ninja Gaiden  is too hard?  &nbsp;   Itagaki : Just fight instead of complaining." -  urlLink www.ign.com   &nbsp;  yes!&nbsp;excellent! how very frank and well-said,  tomonobu-san . that really does sum up every feeling i've had about those complainers out there. so simple, and so true. just stop complaining and play the game intelligently.  &nbsp;     battles  is four guys making music. no genre to slide them comfortably into, no "you'll like them if you like _____", this is just tremendous music. using equal parts standard instruments and crazy electronic gadgets, the stuff that these guys crank out is so good, so fresh and unique, you almost want to buy a whole new stereo system because you owe their ep,  ep c , more respect.&nbsp;or something like that. the only way i can explain what this cd is like is to dissect it track by track.  &nbsp;   1 ..::.. B + T   starts with a simple melody and builds on it with the occasional, fiery bursts of volume as the track runs it's six minute duration.   2 ..::.. UW   a spaced-out and pretty trippy collection of noises and beats that are&nbsp;ultimately an intro to track three.   3 ..::.. HI/LO   the longest song on the cd. listen as&nbsp;beats and melodies evolve from seemingly random noises, only to&nbsp;grow and change and build, calm back down again, build again - it's just fantastic.   4 ..::.. IPT-2   the shortest song on the cd. don't even try to dance or nod your head to this one. it's almost  squarepusher -like in it's speedy and pounding beat.   5 ..::.. TRAS2   this is a great example of this band's magic. it seems as though this amazing song just evolves, like they're making it&nbsp;almost subconsciously and it's just growing.  &nbsp;  while i was hoping for an all out, insan-o climax to the cd instead of the odd drum solo, i still recommend&nbsp; ep c &nbsp;for anyone looking for interesting and cool new music.&nbsp; check them out at  urlLink www.bttls.com   &nbsp;  sounds like ..::.. um... well... yeah... hmm... favorite tracks ..::.. all of them&nbsp; &nbsp;

         a.c. newman 's cd  the slow wonder  is good. it's really good. it's close the blinds, turn it up, and dance around and knock stuff over good. chock full of sing-along-ability and high-energy pop melodies, it's just too much fun to miss out on. if you must,  urlLink http://acnewman.net/  let's you hear some of the good stuff , but if you're craving charming and just plain ingenious pop, you should head out and buy it right now.  sounds like ..::.. new pornographers (duh) with his own magic touch sing-along factor ..::.. 10 out of 10 favorite tracks ..::.. 1,2,3,6,9,10,11     gungrave: beyond the grave  is the first release from the  gungrave anime series , which is being made from a manga and a... well... a videogame.  wait, please don't stop reading.  because, from what i've seen in the four introductory episodes, i only have good things to say about this series from the creator of  trigun.  now, before you get any crazy ideas from that, this is no  trigun . it's much more mature and gritty. episode one pulls you in with slick and badass gunfights that could be described as "john woo all anime-d up", but this show has it's own special style that is pretty darn cool. from the jazzy intro sequence leading each episode's engrossing and tense storytelling, to the crisp, error-free animation, this is one anime that i'll stick with until the very (and probably bitter) end. check out more at  urlLink http://www.gungravedvd.com/ .  badass factor ..::.. 10 out of 10 strong, fresh, and cool character factor ..::.. 10 out of 10 awkward scenes of exaggerated laughter factor ..::.. 6 out of 10 (no anime is perfect. yes, even dragonball z: gt has it's faults)     trackmania  is a relatively unknown pc game that should not remain unkown because of it's originality and fun (just like  gish ,  n ,  pocket tanks , and about a billion other games that get no respect). it's a racing game that is focused on racing and creating wild, almost roller-coaster-esque tracks. where the game really shines is it's well done and extremely fun multiplayer that will have you racing against people from all over the world, criticizing and commending custom tracks, and learning many languages easily. okay, the last one is a stretch but i did learn that germans really like the films  snatch  and  pulp fiction  and will break into fits of argument if you say one is better than the other. hmm.  anyway, get the demo at  urlLink http://www.trackmania.com/  and see what you can find out about germans while racing on some custom tracks.  overall neatness factor ..::.. 8 out 10 crazy germans factor ..::.. 11 out of 10

        there's not really anything i can type to explain  last exile  to you. i don't really want to. it's almost like i would be insulting this series with my half-assed, trying-to-be-witty-and-intelligent-at-the-same-time attempt at a review, when really, all i can say is that if this show continues the way it has, there' s not a doubt in my mind it will be my favorite anime ever. even that sounds stupid.      for some reason, lately i've been craving some loud, fun, mindless music and the two cd's i just bought most definitely satisfied. the first was  the thermals ' " fuckin' a " ,  which is like some kind of garage rock epic masterpiece, and the second was  the soviettes ' " lp II ", which also kicked my ass. who cares if the songs are not much longer than the time it takes (or should take) to brush your teeth, they make me happy and are fun as hell.

        it's done. whew.  boy was i wrong when i said i felt like i was at the end - i was barely halfway. so after a marathon of play, i completed the game and will now  unleash my demonic opinions like a fleet of cacodemons . i mean, review it.  aside from the weak as hell (excuse the pun) sounds of the weapons, the rest of the game is full of creepy and well-done ear candy, especially if you have a 5.1 sound system . monsters will scare you, footsteps will have you looking over your shoulder, eerie moans and howls coming from the walls will haunt you. nice job,  id .  you already know this is the best looking game ever created so we won't need to discuss the technical part of the game.  the straightforward, simple gameplay is exactly what i expected from a  doom  game and it is true to the old formula of shoot-everything-that-moves. however, this doesn't mean that it works perfectly. the game feels too long because of the monotonous and sometimes tedious gunfights. about three-quarters of the way through, it sort of lost that special something and almost turned into repetitious work - aiming and shooting, aiming and shooting, aiming and shooting. it also seemed to lose it's scare-factor - i wasn't really jumping out of my seat anymore. i had seen it all, i saw it coming, and it just seemed annoying. honestly, if this game didn't have the insane engine that it does, there would be almost nothing new or interesting about it.  but that  is  what  doom  does. the original  doom  revolutionized gaming with the first great FPS engine. this  doom  does the same, it revolutionizes how we play and think about games. if you come into this game expecting something like  far cry  or  rainbow six 3,  you'll end up in tears.  this is  doom  and it knows it.     it's by no means bad in the gameplay department, it's really quite tremendous. it's just that when you have a game so heavy on simple action and terror, it needs to be short and sweet. this game was sweet for the first three-quarters, but then the novelty is exhausted and it turns somewhat bland.  but before the game completely went to hell (excuse the pun), the  serious sam -esque final boss battle redeemed the great notions of the game i was still hanging on to. thanks  id  for making that ending kick ass.  so now i'm messing around with the multiplayer and it's exactly what  doom  multiplayer should be - run around, pick up weapons, shoot the hell out of everything moving. the broad-band only connections have proved to work well, as i have encountered minimal amounts of lag during matches. this, along with the mods, will keep  doom 3  on my machine for awhile longer.  if you're system can handle it and you want one of the best action games of the year, regardless of the slight tedium in the latter parts, you need to pick up  doom 3.  if you own it already, and are multiplayering-it-up, my alias is  "poo"  and i'll see you in hell. (i swear, that's the last pun)  overall ..::.. 8.8 out of 10 make you scream like a girl factor ..::.. changes depending on user's level of demon tolerance, but you will likely get scared so 8 out of 10 best graphics ever ever ever factor ..::.. 120 out of 10 multiplayer factor ..::.. 8.1 out of 10 trillions of mods on the way factor ..::.. absolute 10 out of 10   note: my favorite cute little extra from the game is on a person named  rob finch 's pda.   if you have ever seen the tremendous british show  the office , you know that two characters from it are  david brent  and  chris finch , also known as  finchy .   on  rob finch 's pda, there is an e-mail from  brent davis  (which sounds a lot like  david brent ) that reads:    "Finchy,     Don't forget that Trivia Quiz Night is this Wednesday. Do yourself a favor and brush up on the Shakespeare, mate. If we lose to those twits in administration again we'll never hear the end of it.     Brent"    in the tv series    the office ,  chris finch  is always referred to as  finchy  and there is an episode revolving around a staff quiz night. "mate" and "twits", common known british slang, further prove that someone at  id  software is a fan of the show.

      i'm pretty sure i'm closing in on the final few hours of  doom 3 . i've returned to where the whole demon invasion shmeal started and it's getting  messed up . it's gonna be really hard to forget this stuff after the game's over. i can just tell that the most frightening scenes will stay with me long after i've completed the game. but i can't deny that it's been fun and the ending better not disappoint. stay in touch, i'll probably have it beat soon.     controller.controller  finally have a website of their own - and i finally heard their stuff and i'm not disappointed. they're cool and hip and disco-esque and have a great female singer, but that doesn't really say much. i should use a thesaurus to find more intelligent and complicated words to describe them, but wouldn't it be better if you just heard the music yourself? i think so.  urlLink www.controllercontroller.com   sounds like ..::.. !!!, the rapture cool cd cover factor ..::.. 10 out of 10 for sure

      i'm many more hours into  doom 3  and it has grown scarier, harder, and more fun. there have been a few moments that even the most experienced pop-out-scare anticipator would never see coming. if you play in the dark, with the volume cranked up way loud, it's impossible not to get edgy and downright terrified.  as for the story, it's coming along fairly well, but it's certainly not the games strong point. there are a few mysterious elements that are interesting enough to make you curious, but it ain't no  half-life .  the more i play, the more this game seems faithful to the original  doom  games. as a  huge  fan of the originals, i'm confident to say this game really is the original formula with a ridiculous engine slapped over it. this creates some problems, but they are no match for the better parts. it's not complex, it's not deep, it's just a game thats light on strategy and extremely heavy on straight-up action and tension.  more updates will follow as i blast on through the giant floating heads, rocket-launcher skeletons, and demonic bulls. stay in touch.

      if you ever have the chance to go to  ireland,  do  not  pass it up. for me to describe how much i love it in words would take a whole different blog, so i'll just say that - other than my bed - it is my favorite place in the world.    i managed to make it home in time to pick up  doom 3  the day it came out, august 3rd (as if you didn't know) and i can honestly say i'm scared.  the first ten minutes or so of play is action-less, just lets you and the controls get introduced, creates the setting and the mood, establishes a plot and characters, and builds some tension (if you pick up anyone elses PDAs, you can see eerie clues of the forthcoming disaster). Then, all at once, in about three seconds - excuse the pun - all hell breaks loose. Almost immediately after meeting an edgy scientist who is transformed into a rabid zombie with glowing eyes, the entire facility is torn to shreds. the lights are constantly jittering from bright to complete darkness, the walls are falling apart, structures are collapsing, and all around you echoes the tortured sounds of the others trapped in the labs, accompanied by hellish howls and abstract sounds, with some creepy whispering and alarmingly loud bashes thrown in for effect. you'll encounter various demonic enemies and pop-out situations that will have you leaping from your seat as you travel from room to room. so, i'm a little more than two hours into it and yes, i will admit, i am scared.  but it's just too much fun to stop playing. i'll keep you posted as i journey (as spoiler free as i can) through this crazy environment.     the futureheads  have been compared to  franz ferdinand , and while that is valid in some ways, i think that doesn't give them enough credit.  the futureheads   do  create dancy-pop-rock type of music that you can't help but sing along to, but they infuse the songs with their own stylish touch that keeps them from sinking into anonymity or simply being labeled as a  franz  rip-off. you should definitely check them out at  urlLink www.thefutureheads.com   sounds like ..::.. radio 4, franz ferdinand with more brit-punk
