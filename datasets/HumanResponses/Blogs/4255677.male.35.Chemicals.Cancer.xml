      I have lots of time on my hands at the moment after being in a motorbike crash so I saw this on the Google page and thought I'd give it a try. I've been unable to work since the day of the crash, July 16th, and I'm so bloody bored. The combination of not being able to use my left arm, having no transport and living in a small town with very little to do means that over the last four weeks I've spent a small fortune renting DVD's and going to the pub. Luckily two friends of mine work from home so I've not had to sit in the pub on my own crying into my beer like some sad Billy No Mates. Well not often anyway. I've just heard that my bike is ready to pick up. The crash happened at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon during Swindon's rush hour. I had just left a shopping centre and was planning on going to a friends house for a haircut. I had travelled about 1/2 a mile and got caught up in the rush hour traffic tailing back from a large roundabout so I moved into the bus lane, completely legal for motorbikes, and headed up the hill passing all the stationary cars in the other lane. At exactly the same time a gold Toyota Avensis was heading down the hill from the roundabout with the intention of turning right,( you've got to remember that I'm from the UK and we drive on the left), into an industrial estate. I was heading up the hill on the other side of the road so the turning into the industrial estate was on my left. As I passed the turning the guy in the Toyota cut across me from my right and that's the last thing I remember about the accident. Well the last thing I remember is seeing a big gold blurry car in front of me and thinking to myself, quite calmly, that I was going to get really hurt here. The first thing I remember after the crash is hearing a woman's voice telling me that she was going to take my crash helmet off. I opened my eyes and saw my bike in pieces on the other side of the road then promptly passed out again. The next time I came around I was lying on a stretcher in the back of a speeding ambulance and a paramedic was asking me questions about an accident that she seemed very interested in. It must have taken me about five minutes, just sitting there staring at her and wondering who the hell she was, before it all started coming back to me. That confused five minute period is the weirdest experience I've ever had. My injuries consisted of a thorasic sprain in my back, a swelling inside my shoulder joint, a neck sprain, lots of cuts and the whole left hand side of my body came out in a horrible black bruise. The doctors at the hospital told me later that when this kind of accident occurs, a travelling motorcycle getting hit by a travelling car, the motorcyclist is lucky to get away with broken limbs so I must be a very lucky Welsh bastard. I'm not sure what theme my blogs are going to take, I've read a few others and they seem to follow a particular theme, so I hope you enjoyed reading this and if not I'm sure you'll let me know.
