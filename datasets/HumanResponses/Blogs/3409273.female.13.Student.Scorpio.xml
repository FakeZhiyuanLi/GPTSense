      wow, ito ang aking unang post. yehey.Ü sa site na to hindi na ko mag-eengLish, kasi baka sabihin ng iba feeLing ako, or something like that. kung hindi kayo nakakaintindi ng tagaLog, maLas niyo. or visit my xanga site naLang. cLick  urlLink here .  ma, summer came and went so quickLy. ay, hindi na nga paLa ako mag-eengLish. i forgot.Ü anyway, parang kahapon lang nung periodic exams for fourth quarter, tapos ngayon second year na. haaay. ayoko nang mag-araL!  but raLLy, it's worth it naman eh [ang panget ng tagLish..Ö] kasi pag pumapasok ka you aLso enhance your sociaL skiLLs [taLagang hindi ko mapigiL mag-engLish! s**t!Ü] and i think tama lang yun kasi mas marami kang makikita at magiging mas heaLthy ka. o diba?Ü tapos marami ka rin friends.. para masaya.Ü  taps shempre the best about going to school is yung experiences mo. it's like, pag hindi ka pumunta sa schooL waLang mangyayari sa buhay mo na something worth remembering. or something like that. basta, gets niyo ba yung point ko? basta yun. kaya kahit maka-2.5 ako sa lahat ng subjects ko sa second year, i'd gLadLy go through the experience again if i can.. and again, and again.Ü  after aLL, minsan ka na nga lang magiging high schooL, sa span of life mo na 70 years, 4 years ka lang magiging masaya with your highschooL friends. so better make the best of it. [ang kuLit. sabi ko bawaL na mag-engLish eh! haay!Ü]  -end of message.Ü-

      it's 8:35am and i'm supposed to go to pisay [my schooL] at 9 with mithi but since i think she's asLeep i might as weLL have fun on the net whiLe waiting. i've got everything ready for my enroLment, but i reaLLy don't have money. i guess i ran out during our reguLar mithi-and-i trips to sm north.. but whatever.  it's so sad to know that one of my barkadas, jerico, is "migrating", or as he uses the term. i think they're going abroad because of the eLection resuLts [which is stupid, i guess, so they must have another reason]. he won't be coming back to pisay anymore, which is sad.  i'm so excited. i don't know why.

      tomorrow i'm going to have to enroLL.. aLready? it seems onLy yesterday when i was sitting in my cLassroom taking my periodicaL exams.. and now summer's over aLready? time to say bye-bye to my summer friends, and heLLo to more homework. nooo!  but then, i don't have to feeL aLL sad about it. after aLL, i'm going to see my friends tomorrow.Ü and i'm actuaLLy excited to go buying new schooL suppLies, new rubber shoes, new everything. weLL, aLmost everything, that is.  and above aLL that, going to schooL is not the most dreaded part of life. it's actuaLLy the most exciting, the most fun. especiaLLy now that i'm in high schooL. i know there is nothing reaLLy exciting about second year-- no prom, no parties, just studies-- but who knows? i might come across something whiLe living what i think is a perfectLy normaL life..
