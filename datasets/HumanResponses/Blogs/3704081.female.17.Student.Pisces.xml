      &nbsp; Wildhorse put me really close to some of the people&nbsp;I had&nbsp; considered  friends, and really opened up my eyes. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE SUCK!!!! I'm not naming names, (but if you went, you might catch on...) I think that's why I made new friends and didn't spend so much time with the other LC kids. They got to be a tad bit irritating. Speaking of "tad" I made some new friends that were from LC as well, and got closer to some of the other girls in our group. I think that was what God wanted me to do- branch out and meet new people and strengthen some of the bonds with the ones I didn't know too well.  I took a "survey" this morning, it was different...but fun.   The Soundtrack to Your Life Survey  Make a soundtrack for your life, matching songs with the following: Opening song: "The remedy" by Jason Mraz  Waking up: "I Wish You Were Here" By Incubus (It's my wake up song on my alarm.) First date: "I'll Be" by Edwin McCain  First kiss: "Learning to Breathe" by Switchfoot  Falling in love: "Echo" by Incubus  Seeing an old love: "I've Got to See You Again" by Norah Jones  Heartbreak: "Love Me Like That" by Michelle Branch  Driving fast: "Hold My Hand" by Hootie and the Blowfish (I crashed my honda to this song...)  Getting ready to go out: "Seniorita" by Justin Timberlake  Partying with friends: I don't party.  Dancing at a club: "Hey Ya" by Outkast. Everybody loves it.  Flirting: "Shut up and Kiss Me" by Mary Chapin Carpenter  Being Good: "Ain't Misbehavin'" by Ella Fitzgerald  Walking alone in the rain: "Breathing" by Lifehouse  Missing someone: "Miss you" by Blink 182  Playing in the ocean: "Island in the Sun" by Weezer  Summer vacation: "California" by Phantom Planet  Fighting with someone: "You're So Vain" by Carly Simon  Acting goofy with friends: "Seventeen" by Tim McGraw  Thinking back: "Mother Mother" by Tracy Bonham  Feeling depressed: "I'm Moving On" by Rascal Flatts  Christmas time: "Jingle Bell Rock" by Bing Crosby  Falling asleep: "Godspeed" by the Dixie Chicks  Closing song: "Secret" by Maroon 5   urlLink  Take The Soundtrack to Your Life Survey

       I am on such a spiritual high right now! I'm so proud of my friends Cory and Kayla, they accepted Christ this week at wildhorse canyon. I bought my mom a sweater and a rad little stuffed giraffe for Hannah. Andrew got the same one, and is all mad at me, but he won't ever see it unless he decides to hang out with my little sister.  weird.  but i don't think that'll ever happen. She decided to stay another week in pendleton, so I can't drive over and see her and bring her home, sad... so now I wait until Thursday.

       My best best buddie pal is home!!!  That would be Ashley. She's been in Utah all freaking summer.  Loser.  Nah, not really, I'm just lonely. I was at her house last night for about 5 hours just talking. I told her the story about me and 6 other girls getting stuck in an elevator at our  urlLink hotel in Madrid ,(that's the backside of the hotel in the picture) and  urlLink the fountain with the lions...  she got a kick out of that one. I think we're suck good friends because she's another one of those "happy kids" like me who just doesn't let stuff get them down.  *Brush your shoulders off*   (In the words of Christine...her and her rap music.) But now I'm leaving and have to travel some more. Yay.  I'll be home on the 24th. Go to  urlLink Wildhorse canyon  sometime, or  urlLink Malibu . Or go backpacking at  urlLink Beyond Malibu . They're freaking awesome!    Back in a week!

       Dear ________,  I am really ...well I don't know what the word is for it with you right now. You know, it just bothers me how I sit around and I wait for you and then you never follow through with  anything.  Today isn't the first day this has happened. Sure, we do hang out occasionally and we do have fun together, but those times are like.. once in a blue moon.   I don't get you at all.  You say that we are good friends, but whenever I want to do something, or try and make plans with you, you are always too busy, or too tired, or this is happening or that is happening.   You know what hurts my feelings worse? When you give me an excuse, I know that you're really going places with your other friends.   *But I won't name names because then you would know that this is directed at you, and I don't want that to happen.* I'm just trying to get out some emotions right now.     I just wish and hope that someday I'll mean as much to you as you mean to me.

      I can actually say I've had an AWESOME day! I got a few phone calls that really made my day from Trent, Lisa and my Grandma. It's nice to catch up with people, even though you haven't heard from them in a week. I like to hear about everybody else's summer, it might give me some ideas for when I'm bored and broke. I went golfing today, shot pretty well, had a few screw ups, but some good recoveries. I was watching the golf channel this morning with my dad and I learned something about my putter, which helped me with long putts and from the fringe. It turns out, mine's balanced differently, so I'm supposed to center the ball on the heel rather than the center. I  still shot in the 80s, so I'm a happy camper . Jeremy beat me though. By 9 strokes today. It was only 4 last week.  Grr.   Last night after work, Jeremy, Christine and I were on the hunt for ice cream. We went to Mickey D's, where the building just got redone, so the inside is trying to look like a diner,  with driftwood by the ketchup ... Anyway, we all got our ice cream and left. But  you should know that Christine has a lead foot.  And a Mustang. She goes flying out of the parking lot onto the highway, forgetting there's a median... "Now why the hell didn't you tell me there was a M-F-ing median there?!?" That was hysterical. No damage done though.  Thankfully.

       What a wonderful day. Already, I've seen over 500 hot dogs eaten on the Nathan's 85th Annual Hot Dog eating Contest. That's just nasty.   urlLink   The same guy won again for the 4th time. He ate 53 hotdogs in just 12 minutes. NASTY. Must be that American spirit. The fireworks show the  true  American spirit. We're a nation of pyros, and I am proud to be an American!

      So yeah, my summer is definitely the most boring summer any American high school student has ever known. Sure, I've traveled quite a bit, but that wasn't social! You can't say that it wasn't entirely educational either. But what I did learn from that trip of mine is this: people suck. People like the ones I went with primarily. They all were nice for about the first, oh, five minutes. But now I'm home, with the majority of my friends that I actually want to be around are gone. So I fill up my time talking to a bunch of boring people who don't ever do anything. here's how a conversation goes: "Hi." "hi." "what's up?" "nothing much, how about you?" "Nothing." and it just stops. Doesn't that sound exciting?  NO.

      I've discover a very shocking thing about myself.  I thrive off of chaos!  I read a book Page let me borrow, called  urlLink "The Truth About Forever."   (there's a summary there) It seemed like it was a book about  me ! The girl in the story was very involved in school, had a good mom, a rebellious older sister, no dad in sight (my real one isn't), and lived such a routine life everyday with her brainiac boyfriend (that's the part where it's not like me.)  Then she gets a job at a catering place, which at every event, something goes wrong, is lost, is broken... Sounds like Gallucci's to me. But the odd thing is, she loves it! Sounds all too familiar. I'd never quit that job if I could live with my mom forever and not have to go to college... but then there's reality.  But after working there, she's opened up to new things, new people, and a new outlook. Oh, and one more thing she did in the book that's like me, she found the courage to talk to her mom about her life. Not just work, but life. I tried that a while back, but all that got me were tears and a fight.   I've been embracing the curls in my hair lately, and I think I'm not going to blowdry it everyday like I've done for the past 4 years.  My head needs a break.

       Poor Ashley, the only person she's ever really loved died. Nathaniel was from Iowa, he was in a motorcycle accident. On Sunday, I took the night off and went and just got her away from her house before she really lost it. Her mom tried to make her read his obituary! That's just cruel. We drove all over town and went for coffee and then went to Ryan's. I've never heard a person sob so hard, but I can only imagine how much that would hurt.      Hey Ash, I know you've heard this a million times, and have been let down about 95% of the time, but hear this: I will always be here for you. Always.
