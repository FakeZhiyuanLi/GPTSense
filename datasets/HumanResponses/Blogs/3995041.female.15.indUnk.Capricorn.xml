I call it my mad cow! literally! not angry mad! but a crazy mad. when I get to my computer at my dad's house I can scan it on so everyone can enjoy my creation! Well acually I'm not sure if everyone will like it, but it's worth a shot right? I probly won't get any comments on this one, but maybe in the future I will, this will give me lots of stuff to do.

Well my real name is Tabitha, but I don't like being called that! Because, well I'm a tomboy, aka I'm a girl that acts and dresses like a guy!
