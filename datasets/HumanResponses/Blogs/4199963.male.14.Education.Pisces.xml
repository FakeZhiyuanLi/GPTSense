Thats about all from me but finally one of the best movies is on monday...American Pie cant wait to see it.   cya!   GO BLUES!!!

       So many things r happenin at skool like rach and tom getting together, so many people leavin our class and ppl blamin us 4 wastin time 4 no reason. so many things changin so dam quikly wen will sumthing normal will happen.    i cant think of anything else to say so ill just put sum jokes in.       Yo mama's so fat, when she stepped on the dog's tail we had to change his name to Beaver.       What is 40 feet long and smells like urine? Line dancing at the nursing home.    A GUT-WRENCHING FART STORY A man woke up every morning and passed gas. After about eight or nine years of marriage, his wife finally said, if you fart any more, you'll fart your guts out. Being a butcher, the wife decided to put pig scraps in his pants so he would wake up, and not do it anymore. She put the scraps in his pants that night. He woke up in the morning and went across the hall to the bathroom. Two long hours later, he came out and stated, honey, you were right about me farting my guts out BUT WITH THE GRACE OF THE DEAR LORD AND THESE TWO FINGERS. I GOT THEM BACK IN THERE.       10 Signs That A Kid Is A Nerd 10. Likes people that oppress him: teachers, parents, principals, police, and authority figures.    9. Is overly enthusiastic about 'Dungeons and Dragons' and other role playing games.    8. Very familiar with megahertz, wears glasses and, can quote scripture.    7. Frequently speaks of martial arts, but still gets beaten up.    6. Says 'Whom' instead of 'Who.'    5. Is pleased when disruptive individuals are sent to the office, so that they can continue with their learning.    4. Prefers NPR to any music.    3. Gets upset when there is a test or quiz that he did not know about.    2. Rooted for Deep-Blue in the famous chess game.    1. Must be pulled off bridge when not accepted at the college of his choice.        Evan -  As you could probably guess, jokes about penises fall in the "offensive" category, so I've taken them out.  Remember - on the blogs, you're always at school . You wouldn't make those jokes in class - don't make them here. We're learning about responsible and appropriate writing, and that wasn't it.  I'm not going to give you a strike for two reasons: first, because  the jokes weren't  directed at any person in 8S, and second, because it was the first offence.  I'm sure you'll know better the next time .  (I wondered about the "nerd" jokes for a while too, but I think we can leave them up for the simple reason that, despite being the class with the smartest kids, 8S doesn't actually have any nerds...)
