      I'm siccckkk. Arrghhh !!! Fever and stomach ache. Not fun at all. It's weird cause yesterday in Lit class , one of my friend turned to me and said " You look pale today , i think you're gonna fall sick tomoro ". I was shocked. And how true it turned out to be. One hour after i came back from college , my temperature increased. My stomach growled. Ouch. Had to skip class today , thank god i only had one lecture today ( the most boring one too HOI ). I'm actually&nbsp;feeling better already , this evening two kind friends were nice enough to drop by and visit me. They even brought me apples! ( Thank uuuu ) Tonight we already planned of going this place to eat mamak food so even if i wasn't feeling too good , i just had to go. Had some good old teh tarik and roti plaster. YUUUMMMMMM. Too bad my stomach wasn't in the condition for my 2nd roti so i had to donate it to some greedy vultures ( kafaii duh ) Oh well i still enjoyed it , i mean , its MAMAK! Now to find some place that sells mango special and garlic cheese naan...

      Another skool week is over. Hurraayy! Starting to get really used to life over here. Everyday its wake up - college - back - nap - dinner - online/hw - sleep - repeat. The walking distance does not matter anymore and the cold weather is not felt anymore. But it is getting colder everyday though =P its reported at about 6 degrees today. Brrrrr!!!&nbsp;Classes are good so far. Coping really well and there isn't really&nbsp;much homework.&nbsp;Even if there was ,&nbsp;the lecturers wont bother to check it. So its pretty relaxed i'd say.  &nbsp;Two days ago we helped our friend move his stuff. He was shifting because he didn't have a proper place to stay before this ( He was sleeping at the friends' living area ) Had to carry his bags for about 20 minutes walk. Caused me a shoulder ache ( Oww ) But oh well , good deed has their rewards - he treated us dinner. How nice of him. Ohh and last night , kafaii's sis cooked us bak kut teh. Obviously it wasn't as good as back home , but who cares ? Its BAK KUT TEH !!! SYOOK!!!!   Tomoro's weekends again..... wonder wat to do ?

      Yes , i did. For the first time in my life , i cooked for dinner. It was just some simple instant pasta ( Macaroni and Cheese )&nbsp;, but it still required some skill at least =P It turned out not too bad. It wasn't as tasty as i expected though. I guess i added too much milk. Oh well , there's always a next time.&nbsp; Lip Zhun fried the fish fingers and Kafaii.....umm....... washed the dishes. Oh waiit he did cut some onions. And he cut them into real big chunks. Yummm......I HATE ONIONS !!! I also found out that my cup cracked for no obvious reason , so i had to walk all the way to Kafaii's place to borrow a cup later that night. How sad.....

      Just before i start , here's a group pic of the winning team during camp : &nbsp;   &nbsp; We started the weekend by going to Smith Street to do a little shopping. Daniel and a few other friends of ours came to join us. Poor&nbsp;Daniel , had to wake up early just to miss a train ; and when he finally made it here at 9.30am , we we're supposed to leave at 10. ( kafaii told him we're leaving at 9 lol ) Anyways we took a tram to our destination. Smith Street is filled with factory outlets like Nike , Adidas , Reebok and so forth therefore making it a perfect place for me to get a pair of walking shoes. The shoe i brought here was spoilt during camp time. How sad. It was my favourite shoe too , a Nike Shox Limitless. Oh well , at least i got myself a nice Converse shoe for 49.95 $ and an orange Nike T for 10 bucks. Not a bad bargain huh. Kafaii and the rest also found themselves on a spending spree, buying shirts , jackets and shoes. We bumped into a few other college friends on the way and they too joined the party and we had lunch together. &nbsp; Later that night, me and Daniel went for dinner at China Town. After that , we decided since we had nothing to do why not crash Jenshen and Kwok Liang's&nbsp;place. They have after all&nbsp;, a Gamecube and not to mention a&nbsp;lot of snacks.&nbsp;Keewwlllll ! So we did , and George came over too so we played multiplayer games till about midnight.&nbsp;Not fair , they have a bigger apartment than us =(  &nbsp; Sunday morning , woke up pretty late today. Once again we joined our friends to eat at an Indonesian restaurant. Then it we went grocery shopping. Didn't take too long , managed to stock up on food and snacks. Its amazing how small this world is , we bumped into nearly half of the&nbsp;fast track students. Things got pretty boring after that. Daniel played the comp while i took a nap. For dinner , we we're joined by George and a friend of his to get a nice hot bowl of Vietnamese beef noodles. MMMHHMMMMM

      I had drama class yesterday.&nbsp; Yes , drama. For the first time in my life i've attended a class which is stress-free and best of all , no books! It was&nbsp;really fun , i mean when was the last time we actually had fun in class? But maybe it's also the fact that over here , we're not really close to our classmates yet so it feels OK if we do something stupid or make a fool of ourselves. Drama takes like 30 % of our english marks, we have to do solo and group performances. Sounds interesting , doesn't it. Getting marks for something other than writing on paper :/ . But either way , its still my favourite subject so far. One thing though , we need to take off our shoes during class. So better wash our feets every Thursday.....&nbsp; Anyways , for dinner , we suddenly came up with the idea to crash our friend's place Calvin ( not Yew thank god ) and order some pizzas. His apartment was opposite our college at Swanston's , and man is his house big! It's like umm how am i gonna describe this..... lets just say his living room is bigger than my whole apartment. Yeah it is.&nbsp; And he umm lives there ALONE. Wow! Rich kid. He's even got cable TV. I'm so darned jealous. But oh well , he was kind enough to let us hang out there for dinner. We had 4 large pizzas , and it was divided among 6 of us. Mannnn it was gooood. Better than Malaysian pizza anytime. Hehe... &nbsp; Today is the shortest college day of the week , or every week. 2 classes from 11 to 3. We planned to play sports after skool but it didn't turn out so well for me. We took off to the uni sports center and when we arrived it started raining. Not onli that , the courts we're full. So we headed back. And just when we were about to arrive home , our friends called and said that they were still going to play football. So kafaii went on and play with them but i headed home. No bball kakis sniff sniff. Oh well , good time to sleep anyways. It's starting to get really really cold here , might be because of the rain , but still..... Brrrrrrr &nbsp; Here's the group pic at the airport. Yeah i know , its FREAKING SMALL but i'm sure u'll find ur head there somewhere =) &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Things are starting to become a routine. College life, it seems. Yesterday things were back to normal. However i did manage to squeeze some time to meet up with my cousin during lunch break. Unfortunately , she was stingy and she refused to treat me . Sigh. Some cousin she is ( just kidding! ) Last night, we had a mini party at our friend's place and the girls cooked dinner. Not for us though, we already ate. Homework is starting to pile up. Not a good sign.....  Woke up this morning at 7.30am thanks to my dearest friend Daniel who was so kind to give me a morning call ( DAMNNN YOOUUU!!!! ) I was feeling drowsy. Class starts at 11, and HOI ( History of Ideas u noobs ) was first on queue. As expected, history is never fun. The whole class nearly felt asleep , and Kafaii described her as Jigglypuff ( Those who play Smash Bros should know wat it means ) And thankfully there was no psyhics lab in the afternoon so YEAAAAYYY free time!!! Finally got some time off to relax. Had to teman kafaii to bank to settle some of his stuff. The weather is getting colder and colder.....  *** My posts are gonna be real short starting from now cause everyday life is kinda the same now so ill just put stuff thats out of the ordinary =) ***

      Phew i'm exhausted. We had a lecture marathon on Thursday. Man it was sooooo tiring!! It was from 8.45am to 3.45pm with onli 45 minutes break for lunch. Not fun. Yeah yeah many of u will argue that it's nothing different from college back home but, i had 8 months holiday so... =P hehe. It was so damn boring i had to turn out my ipod during HOI class ( that's history of ideas ). I planned to stay up late to chat wif my friends back home but damn the internet had to malfunction. How unfortunate. That's why i didnt post anything on Thursday. The next day was camp. It was held at Rawson Village, no idea where it is myself. At first , we we're all really unhappy about the camp. Karen and Jenshen told us how boring the place was and how dull it would be. They really turned us off. Thank god things turn out differently ( Explained later ).  It was about 2 hr's drive from Melbourne to get to our destination. It wasn't too cold, we we're then allocated to our rooms. We had lunch, fish and chips. Yummmmmm.....free meals hehe. The next activity sounded boring at first, it was drama activities. But it turned out to be good fun, we had to act out 5 slides of still pictures at a certain location. And of course with a story behind it. Each group had their own ideas and all of them were unique and very hillarious. Our's was about me and my wife having a honeymoon at a luxury resort, and were later attacked by a shark ( How sadistic ) The next activity was bushwalking , probably the most boring activity at the camp. It was just a really really long walk through the forest with nothing too exciting. But we chatted on the way so it wasn't too bad. Ironicly after dinner, we had to best activity at the camp. Bush dancing. Something new. Something cool ;). It's hard to describe the dance, they taught us quite a number of it. Its kinda like a party dance, like dance dance dance then switch partners and it goes on and on. So basically we get to dance wif all the gurls hehe. Everyone was sporting, everyone participated. It was really great, we didn't want to stop, but we had to. But the fun didn't end there. We we're playing around wif the basketball a little , and then the gurls suggested to play captain ball. Not a bad idea, we thought. And it wasn't. We had heaps of fun , and the gurls turned out to be more aggresive than the guys. Scary. We could have went on forever , but kafaii got a cramp, and it was then only that we realised it was midnight already. I made a lot of new friends , and slowly we're getting closer to each other.  Next morning, woke up freezing. The wind was blowing hard, and the air was cold as ice. The schedule was like NS , meal - activity -tea - activity - meal - and so forth. We were seperated into four groups, each doing different activites at the same time. My group was really sporting. We got together really well. We did high ropes , something i missed out in NS. It was scary at first , and it really hurt my hand. It felt fiery after that. Later, we played captain ball , AGAIN. Our lecturer in charge joined us, making things a little more interesting. We did the flying fox ( its starting to really sound like NS huh ) And my favourite , basketball !!!. There's this Japanese girl , she's really good in basketball. She plays for the Osaka Sabers. Wow. Hehe. It was great to shoot some hoops again, its been like a month ? Ohhhh it felt good. Next up was the mini-olympics. It would have been fun if it wasnt for someone in my team who is a real pain in the a**. Just thinking of him pisses me off. At first , the events sounded real serious, like 100m dash , high jump and stuff like that. Turns out things were different , like the long jump, was actually the limbo. Haha. It was quite fun, and our group turned out second. We we're awarded a lollipop each. Hehe. During intervals we play ping pong and some football. I earned myself a new nickname , chicken wings. It's spreading like wildfire , and i'm always the joke. So what else is new? Oh , and i spotted a koala hanging on a tree that night. Not something you see everyday huh.  The start of a new day,  and i was feeling like an eskimo. We had to pack our bags , it was the last day of camp already. After breakfast we were seperated into our four groups again for some kind of competition. It consists of 4 mini games, and the points were added up to judge the champion. And guess whose group won =P We had teamwork , we worked hard , and enjoyed it at the same time. Our prize was a packet of Maltese , something i wanted to try for quite some time. ( It's choc btw ) We had tea , and we had time for just one more activity , the low ropes. No competition , just something to test our balance and stuff. Wasn't too interesting , but it was a good way to kill time. After lunch , it was back to Melbourne again. We got together wif our college friends for dinner, and we ate Indonesian food. Sigh time flies so fast when you're having fun. Tomorrow's the start of a tight schedule......

      Ahh , the start of another new day. Woke up early today, at 9, surprisingly. And i slept at about 1 o clock. Something bad happened last night but i'd rather not talk about it. Just another of my stupid accidents. Warmed up the garlic bread that came with the pizza the last time for breakfast. Played my notebook for a while, waiting for kafaii to arrive. Together , we left to the bank to activate our accounts. Didn't take too long, just a simple procedure. Recharged my pre-paid (don't ask why) and then we rushed to college. They're holding a Book Room, where we can buy our necessary lecture notes. We then had 2 hours break before the next lecture, so we decided to get our lunch at the Union House. 2 other friends joined us, they're from Malaysia too and from the same NS camp as kafaii. I ate kebab, the meat was not too bad but the bread was just too think. At the end of the meal i was exhausted from all the munching and chewing =P Kafaii on the other hand, ate tomyam noodles , but nooooo it wasnt enough. He had to feed on his friend's chicken rice too! tsk tsk tsk. Then we went to this common area where to got some rest, actually we were just killing time before the next lecture. We started to look at our Math 1 lecture notes, figuring out how to solve some questions ( Yes it's freakky i know ) After a long wait, the lecture started. It was just introduce to us on how to use the Trinity Portal. Nothing i couldn't do myself. It was soooo damn boring. Later, we found ourselves back home again. Didn't do much, just hung around till it was dinner time. Lipzhun went and joined his cousin, while me and Karen joined kafaii and his sis. His sister brought us to this Malaysian Chinese restaurant. Ate noodles with char siew. Not bad not bad. At least they had a decent ammount of vege in it. Haven't seen greens much these days...hehe. The night was still young, so they all came over to my place to just , umm well , hang out. Kafaii brought us to this website www.albinoblacksheep.com. It's full of lame video clips and laughed our heads off watching some of them ( SHOW ME , SHOW YOU , KIKKOMAN ! KIKKOMAN! hahahahahah ) Can't believe we spent 2 hrs on that...

      Warmed up some overnight pizza for breakfast. Finally something not cereal. Hehe.  We were supposed to be attending some introductory lectures at college but we decided to  skip it. Our first "ponteng". We had more important things to do. We had to get our phones. Kafaii met up with us and off we were to the nearest Optus outlet. ( Optus is something like Maxis ) Me and kafaii got ourselves Optus pre-paid, so its free for us to call each other now. Not to mention its free to Karen and Daniel too =) Next up, we went to Exhibition Street to get our internet cable connection ( for me and lip zhun ) It was quite a long walk, and it took us a while to find the place. We got ourselves a 190k cable connection. We were hungry then, so we dropped by at the nearest Hungry Jack for lunch. Fastfood is , after all the cheapest meal around. We then rushed back to try out our internet. Worked like a charm. Super fast too. I downloaded stuff at 100kb per sec. That's about 2.5X faster than my streamyx back home. Coooooooollll! Couldn't enjoy it for long though. We needed to go college , for subject selection. We left for college, and found ourselves back in the apartment in less than an hour. The subject selection didn't take long. We got back just to find out that....our internet was not working! Darn!!! Had no choice but to take a nap , praying that it'll work when i woke up. It didn't. Damn. Dinner time. We had a good meal, at A1 again. Roast duck rice, yummmmmm. It's always good to have some Chinese food once in a while. Went back to the apartment, and Internet's back on. Hurraayyy. Jenshen and Kwok Liang came over for a while, just to catch up on old times. Played a few games of DOTA , dont you just miss it ? =)

      I couldn't go online yesterday to blog so here it is. It was our first day of college! Yeaaayyy!!!  Woke up early as college started at 8.45. Lip Zhun stayed up to watch the Finals of EURO2004 and while kafaii planned to watch it, he didn't. He slept like a rock. Greece won...NOOOOOO!!! Anyways we packed our bags, ate a simple breakfast (cereals, AGAIN) and off we were. It took about 25 minutes for us to get to the Evan Burge Building, where our registration was held. It was simple, very organized. We got to know a few new friends from Indonesia, Singapore and even China. We were then treated for lunch. It was yummy and kafaii wanted more, but he "pai seh" wor.... Hehe. We were seated with the Deputy Director of Trinity and she was really friendly. She's actually from Malaysia. She came to Melbourne more than 20 yrs ago for her studies and never turned back since. And oh yeah Lip Zhun said loudly in front of her that we're skipping class tomorrow! *smacks hand on face* Later, we were brough on a tour of trinity college. It was a long walk, about an hour. The tour guide was really nice, and from Malaysia too. We had to attend some lectures after that, to guide us and inform us about our acedemic stuff and about subject selections. Almost fell asleep ZZZZZZ. 4.30, finally ends or first day of so-called college. Back again to the apartment for a well deserved rest.... We got pretty bored after that so me and Lip Zhun tried out some LAN gaming. Wasn't too bad, better than nothing. We played Jedi Outcast and Warcraft3 haha. And to our surprise , there's a channel on our TV that shows a surveillance camera at out main door! How cool is that? We ordered Pizza for dinner. Australian pizza and BBQ chicken pizze. Yummmmmm...very full tho! Couldn't finish it all so we kept it for tomorrow breakfast. End of day 4. ****Btw Lip Zhun is starting to join the "lame" gang ;)***  (my posts are getting shorter and shorter, i hope its not becoming a trend)

      Woke up in the morning , freezing. Woke up my house-mate, who was sleeping without a top. I salute him. Met up with Kafaii and Karen, AGAIN but this time with Lip Zhun joining the party. Stopped by a few places to shop for a compact heater, i need them to warm my feet from time to time. We went to this small chinese restaurant for lunch, named A1. Karen suggested i eat rice with some egg thingy on top so i ordered them with roast pork. It costs me 7.50 bucks, but it was worth it. The portion was big and oh am i glad to be eating rice again =) It was quite a long walk back, and i was carrying my brand new heater so we decided to "hijack" a tram. We call it "hijack" cause we're gonna go on it without paying. Don't ask why , its just some lame thing we made up. It was scary at first, but it doesnt seem so bad after all. We sat the tram to my place to drop of the luggage and get some rest. Somehow we ended up taking some pictures of the apartment and even a video to send to my parents later on. We locked Karen out on the balcony =P The day was still young, so we thought we should check out the location of our college. With Karen as our tour guide, she brought us on a half an hour walk to the college. We managed to catch a glimpse of the sports facilities on the way. Since we're already out, we then decided to crash Karen's place, just to kill time. We stayed at her shack for a while, enjoying a cup of lemonade while checking out some "interesting" magazines *Nyek nyek* We also watched a tape of.... South Park! ( OMG they killed Kenny! You bastards!!! ) We felt tired after that so we hijacked another tram back home. Kafaii got seperated cause he geniusly ran across the road and into the tram without waiting for us. The rest of us couldn't cross. There were cars. Bye kafaii! Luckily he didn't get lost hehe. It was only our second time hijacking a tram. Had a 2 hour nap ZZZZZZ and then it was dinner time. Went out for fastfood again, this time its Nando's. The price was not too bad , at 5.95, but the chicken was freakinnn smalll!!! The side dishes was in a quite big portion though, but it wasn't enough. We went back to kafaii's place for a cup of instant noodles. We're staying overnight cause kafaii and lipzhun's gonna watch Euro 2004 Finals next door....while i sleep =D

      2nd day: Woke up freezing at 9.30pm . Brrrrrrr! Made myself a simple breakfast. Cereals and hot chocolate. Mantainance staff supposed to come to the apartment for a checkup, but turns out he couldn't make it. If only i was told earlier, i'd love to sleep a few more minutes :P I went to kafaii's place to meet up wif him and Karen. It was Simpsons Weekend on FOX8, so we took an hour to drag kafaii out of the apartment. We went to Victoria market to pick up some groceries. Karen spent us some nice , hot spanish donuts. MMMHMMMMMMMM !!! It's like "yau char kuai" wif sugar on it. It was lovely, especially during this kind of weather. Next stop , shopping again. Haha. This time it was mostly for food, you know, instant stuff. I bought pasta, instant noodles, milk among some other stuff. Karen tempted us to get muffins even though i didn't want to. I wanted to save. But she talked me into it, darn another few bucks wasted. We then got back to kafaii's place and cooked lunch. Well actually not we, mostly Karen haha. Me and kafaii helped wif the cutting and of course, tasting. Not really hard to cook though, just dump in the ingredients and let it cook ( the pasta has sauce wif it already in powder form ) It was OK, could have been better cause the pasta was a little hard and chewy, not as soft as it should have been. It was still i good meal, we dumped chicken, onions and carrots it in, not to mention all kinds of salt and seasonings we could find in the cupboard haha. While waiting for the food to be ready , i warmed up the muffin i talked about earlier and maaaannnn it was worth it. Ohhh it was hot and oh so delicious! After that, it was back to the apartment for a little rest. Lip Zhun was still out, wif his cousin. Karen decided not to go dinner, so me and Kafaii went to the nearest fastfood outlet for our dinner. Hungry Jacks. Ate a Whopper meal , which is the cheapest around at 5.85 bucks. And after that i went home to get my laptop and brought it over to kafaii's place. There's where i am right now =)

      1st day: Arrived at airport at about 7 am , aussie time. Didn't get enough sleep, it was uncomfortable. Kafaii slept like a rock. It was havoc at the airport. There was no trolley available, had to drag my super heavy 30kg luggage. I think i built some muscles already =) The imigration department was holding the line back. Took about half an hour to get out from there and to find a nice person waiting , holding a board "Mr. Chee Weng". He drove me to my apartment , Arrow on Swanston. His ride was a luxurious one. Had GPRS , heck he could even charge his phone inside. Took a while to check in , and i found out that my apartment-mate, Lip Zhun was not there yet. Turns out we accidentally left him at the airport (Sorrryyyyy) The apartment looks like a mini hotel. I actually need a keycard to to access the lift , and works as the key to my shack. And guess what, my apartment , with kitchen, toilet , living room and 2 bedrooms, IS AS BIG AS MY ROOM AT HOME!!! But at least everything looks brand new, i guess it shouldnt be a problem living here for a year. After an hour, we got out of our apartment to meet up with Lip Zhun's cousin, this nice guy who knows almost everything about Melbourne. He brought us to the heart of the city, and we met up wif Karen. Lip Zhun and his cousin went their own way for lunch, as me and Kafaii patiently wait for Karen to arrive at Nike shop. Yup, we waited and waited and waited. FOR HALF AN HOUR!!! So sieeen summore so coollddd! We went for lunch, ate fish and chips. And in case u guys are wondering, an average meal here costs 6-8 bucks. Yes its that expensive. Enjoy food as much as u can in Msia. Went shopping later to buy some stuff. Its really convinient to shop here since we're already living in the city... Reached home at about 5pm, finally to get a good rest and a hot bath. I unpacked my bag ( Had to , there isnt even enough place to leave it open ) I went dinner with kafaii and lip zhun, at a Vietnamese Noodle House. Ate a delicious bowl of Beef Noodles, at a huge price though. 7 bucks (7 X 2.8 = ?) After that , boredom. There's absolutely nothing to do here. Hung out at kafaii's place for a while, watching TV. We got bored , so we decided to check out Lip Zhun's cousin's place, which is coincidentally next door !! And OMFG his place is da bomB!!!! He has all kinds of entertainment stuff , he has 1500 K broadband man!!! And he has this really choon PC made by alienware wif a cooling tank at the side wif plastic fishes swimming in it! How cool is that? Not to mention he has the best Altec Lansing speakers connected to his TV and guess wat, he even has Gamecube and PS2!!! And of top of that , FUZZZZBALLL!!! Damn he's got cash. After a while, i got back to my apartment and played a little game of Warcraft3 to kill some time. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

We all took our jabs today though i needed to wait a FREAKIN HOUR for it. Man the doctor took like wat , 10 min per person !??? Grrr!!! And it onli took him 2 sec to jab the freakin thing!!! ( didn't feel a thing ) Anyways dinner wasn't much better either. Me and my stupid bright ideas. Tried to copy Daniel's mom's tuna pasta. Failed terribly.... nearly ate raw potato if not for my friend who was coincidentally around ( potato cant be eaten raw ? LOL ) Tasted like dog food , is was so wet and yucky. Next time i better get the proper recipe before experimenting again.... BLeh!  Still rethinking about the blog layout changing thingy , since Jolene kindly offered her assistance to me =P

      Today we had physics lab and this is the first time for us doing it alone without assistant from lectures/teachers. Man was it a horrible experience. Mine was to study the coefficients of static friction of a variety of materials and some other factors. Have to put a mass on a plane then increase the "tita" to a point where the mass slides down and measure the "tita". Have to change material everytime and all those bull also. Man my results we're all over the place with hugh errors and inconsistency. And to top it all we didn't have time to finish our reports ! Arrghhh !!! And to think that its counted for our total marks in PH ! Omg...... And everyone else had problems too. Next time i'm sure everyone will come to lab prepared for everything......   *** It seems only jolene bothers to comment on my posts...for everyone's info u guys can talk cock by clicking  on the COMMENTS button below every post. And if karen u're seeing this we can go lepak anytime , but its hard to contact u when ur phone is broken =P ***

      It's starting to look like the only thing interesting here is food. Everything else is so normal. I'm starting to play basketball again , but not much. And it will only get less , cause the skin of my right palm is starting to peel again ( its that time of the year i guess ) and its hurting too. I also found out that it is not wise to go shopping alone. You need all those extra hands you can get when you are buying really heavy stuff. I bought a set of kitchenware and sweated my way back to the apartment ( its winter btw ). I've been walking around alone a lot lately , i wonder why...  Anyways back to the food. Lip Zhun's family is in town , and his parents were kind enough to treat me n Kafaii to a luxurious dinner. Lobster noodles.....OOHHHH SYOOKK!!! Something we wouldn't enjoy for a loooooooooooong time. And the other dishes we're unbelivably delicious too! Yummy. And just last night , i walked to Grattan ST to tapau some nasi lemak. They tasted good , obviously not as good as back home , but good enough. That afternoon we also got the chance to try Gelati ( some italian icecream u noobs ) Omg its the best ice cream ive ever tasted! Texture smooth as silk , flavour rich as ummmm Bill Gates ? Oh god that's lame. Must be too much kafaiism. Hmm.... And oh yah i cooked dinner ! Without professional help ! Really ! God and it actually tastes good too. Here is the pic of my newly created dish :    * Yes , yes it doesn't look appetizing but it tastes good ! I promise !*  I forsee an interesting and busy week in front of me , especially with drama. We have to do a 2 min solo mime performance each ( mime = acting without props and sound ) That's gonna be something.....
