       If you're wondering where my first post went, I deleted it. Having that tome about some girl there was starting to freak me out.  Anyway, I haven't had much to do, so I've been watching my Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVD's a lot. (I don't care what you think Adam, the show is great, so it must be  you  who sucks.)  Been fooling around with my computer, playing some DDR, (Dammit Evan, someday you  will  try it!)  etc, etc.  Want to know a great way to spend a Saturday evening? Clubbing? Hanging out with friends? No, try going to the mall and grocery store with your mom. Really puts your social life in perspective.  That cashier at Strawbridge's would just  not...shut...up.   Heh, with Steve in NJ with his girlfriend, I have the computer all to myself, and yet I can't find anything to do with it except make a blog post.     Frylock: Yep, I thought it was about time that we invested in a high-definition plasma screen.    Meatwad: I thought you said TV was bad.  Frylock: It is. But we f***ing need it.

       Yeah, haven't had much to write after complaining my guts out in my last post. Anyway, just wanted to say that a friend of mine (The previously mentioned Adam) played me a song by Five Iron Frenzy called "Pre-Ex Girlfriend" and I am now even more emotionally scarred for life. Here are the lyrics.  "Pre-Ex-Girlfriend"  She's so cool it's almost eerie she's so fine I lost all hope Genetical testing something has gone wrong she should get back in her cage before they find she's gone She said she hated Kenny G that girl is way too good for me We'll break up before it starts She'll only tear my world apart da na na na na na na na  [Chorus:] Pre-ex-girlfriend, that girl is just too fine Pre-ex-girlfriend, leaving me behind  You might say she's everything just before everything goes wrong She's sunshine and lightning she pulls at my heartstrings she's stunning and then she's gone The intellect that girl has She's saying "death to false jazz" Like kryptonite to Superman she's here to break my heart again da na na na na na na na  Watch her on the floor tonight feel the crush she will incite the spark of hope she will ignite a beautiful sight Softer than the lightest snows watch her as the moment slows in my face the door will close and there she goes.   [Spoken:] Guy: Uh-um Hi... Girl: Hi Guy: I uh, I was across the room and I looked over, and I saw you... and um... Girl: yea? Guy: I was wondering if... Girl: Uh-huh Guy: Maybe you wanted to... uh... go do something? Girl: Umm.. No.   You see what I mean? If you don't, you probably haven't read my first post. Hats off to you for opening up old wounds, Adam!

       *Gets pelted with CD's and "Vivi" dolls*  OK, OK, I'M SORRY FOR THE JOKE ALREADY!  Man, you types are a tough crowd.  Anyway, I started playing FFIX again today, for what other reason than: I'm bored. *Dodges a pewter statue of Cloud Strife* -and that Final Fantasy is unrivaled as the greatest series of games ever created and the people of SquareSoft/Square-Enix are gods among men and anyone who believes otherwise should be cast down to the depths of Hell to burn with the likes of Hitler and whoever was responsible for "Temptation Island."  Happy?  Got the "Best Sessions" DVD set of Cowboy Bebop today, too. 6 more episodes in no real order or continuity, but screw it, it's more Bebop.  I suppose that's about it for today. *Gets hit in the eye with a Moogle*  ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE OF YOU THREW THAT!?

         Just another boring summer day. Well, actually, I'm not going to bitch about that today, because I finally went out and did something about it. Namely, I went to the library, and $4.50 later I was in possession of the first five episodes of Cowboy Bebop, the Cowboy Bebop movie, and the 4th-6th episodes of InuYasha.        Holy crap. How I have never been exposed to any of this before is amazing. It is now one of my life's missions to see the rest of the Cowboy Bebop series. InuYasha was good too, but I don't think it can begin to compare with Bebop.        Kinda makes me wish I got Comedy Central for Adult Swim. Blasted anti-cable parents.           Spike: I love the kind of woman that can kick my ass.

       It's August, as you all know by now, and again it is that time of year to ask ourselves: "Where has the summer gone?" It never hits you with how little time you have until August rolls around and you were mentally still in June.  Wait, I'm stopping this line of thought here. The idea of August rolling around and how little time there is in summer has been put into script in probably around 10,000 other blogs by now, and since today isn't "National Write the Same Damn Thing Everyone Else is Writing Day" I won't bore you with what everyone has thought since the invention of summer vacation, back on June 16th, 1842. (Yeah, I made that date up.)  Anyway, I would like to pose a new axiom: "Time flies when you are doing fuck-all." (So you don't get the wrong impression, I am using "fuck-all" to mean "nothing." Ask your parents about it. Don't mention my name.) I mean, I have practically nothing to do, except hanging around with Adam, Ground Zero Gaming, and thinking angsty thoughts while sitting at my computer, without much reason, mind you.     Yeah, I think that's about it.
