      Ok my first design is up, eventhough my exams is around the corner. Just too enthusiast and I don't want the&nbsp; inspirations to fly by. So here it is. The designs aren't that complete yet. Need more time to concetrate. Maybe after my exams.

      First post always seems difficult to me. &nbsp;  Actually this blog is created to develop my web designing knowledge and not much towards my social life.&nbsp; Designs will change later when after my final exams.   [Being different is taking the path not trodden]

      Try adding a comment again bubbles, coz i just took off some codes I added for fun. I guess maybe they are the ones that caused the problems.  A new font color I change. I find it ok for the color contrast, easier to read. What do you all think?

      I'm so sorry about what I did. Totally forgotten about "hotlinking rules", and thanks alot to bubbles for reminding me!   Quote: Hey! Direct linking is WRONG!!!!!! Cos when you do that, you're eating that person's bandwith. and that person has to pay for it. So I hope none of you would do that to me. I don't care about the free hosts though. ;) That's none of my bussiness.     Ok, now to correct what is wrong here.... One way is to host the image files yourself. However most webhoster (even free ones) bans hotlinking.   An understanding of hotlinking and bandwidth stealing I got from the net:      WHAT IS HOTLINKING AND BANDWIDTH THEFT?   Bandwidth theft or "hotlinking" is direct linking to a website's files (images, video, etc.). An example would be using an &lt;img src="" /&gt; tag to display a JPEG image you found on someone else's web page so it will appear on your own site, journal, weblog, forum posting, etc. Bandwidth refers to the amount of data transferred from a website to a user's computer. When you view a webpage, you are using that site's data transfer to display the files. Since web hosts charge based on the amount of data transferred, bandwidth is an issue. If a site is over it's monthly bandwidth, it's billed for the extra data or taken offline.A simple analogy for bandwidth theft: Imagine a random stranger plugging into your electrical outlets, using your electricity without your consent, and you paying for it.     So its wrong to hotlink!! Another way is to use  urlLink  ImageShack  , a free image hosting that allows hotlinking. Its easy to use and most of all, legal. I personally recommend this. Maybe there other hoster around that allows that, just type hotlinking in google and look.    Thanks alot to bubbles for the reminder!!!    Another thing is about bubbles's comment about her problem on my blog. Anyone else expriencing the same problems? Please infrom me fast, if its my blog I'll try to correct it. Thanks alot!!

      Link your blog directly to others by just a simple way! What else you can even insert an image to signify the personality of your blog! Need and image link? Ask me. But first here's how to insert image links in you blog in case you don't know how:   1. Find the image that you want to insert and right click it. 2. Select properties and copy down the URL or address. 3. Enter your blogger dashboard and change your settings. 4. Change the template by inserting the image's URL between the image tags.  &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/app/link"&gt;&lt;img src="imageURL" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  5. For example, bubble's gif link is showned below  &lt;a href="http://www.nimrodel.org" target=_blank&gt;&lt;img src="http://ccc.1asphost.com/214034/img/bearbut.gif" alt="Bubbles" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;      Any questions or comments? The comments link is always there.

      There's a problem with my host server, so I'm very sorry that the contents on the page doesn't come up well. Maybe the host server is down for the moment.
