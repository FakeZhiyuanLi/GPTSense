						      ah, it seems i decided to degrade from the hasty life of real-time online chatting to a simplistic, but nevertheless satistfying, method of board posting communcation... reminds me of those great times i had with bbs (bulletin board systems for you high-tech infants)... damn, that makes me feel so wretchedly old... and to think i've only lived for a quarter of a century...      well, i guess i can use this to keep my sanity intact... if i can write down the things i've done or thought about, perhaps i can actually learn something about myself that might surprise me... then again, i surprise myself by being myself everyday so it's won't be much of a surprise, eh... bummer...      on a happier note, i got a contract job a week ago (03|11|03)... i should be estatic, especially since the work is related to flash mx and xml, but after workin 10 hrs each day straight, it can take away the excitement, ya know what i mean? still, it is a good change in the horribly slow pace i was living as an unemployee (is there such a word? if not, there should be!)...      i'll leave my first post by shouting out, NGO NGOI NEI to the one who lightens my heart everyday with her shining brillance... although, her constant nagging is popping a nerve or two now and again, but it's all good (i hope)... LUV YA, DARLIN' DEAR!    © pu out ©     =======    [[ Commented by liljerms on November 12, 2003 ]]    coo man. what's a bbs? I must be too young.

						    [HOME]     ah coo man... just a few hours ago, i wuz fryin' my brain, ya kno, lookin' for brain pellets and all... then suddenly, wammo! i wuz hit by a stray pellet... luckily, i caught it with my teeth which caused waves of "programmic" knowledge to flow in... ah da vibes, man... i can feel it, the power of the true source... Da One Source... i must drink from it.... yes drink... i must.........    ah refreshin!  tastes like chicken soup!      then again, perhaps i read waaaaaaay too many fantasy books....... at least chicken soup is truly da One ReSource against evil Lord Coldermort........ damn, i DO read way too many fantasy books...........     seriously, tho, i came across a revolutionary an idea that may make all those coo DHTML sites seem elementary.... it deals with what i call "streeaming dynamic tree loading"... i might as well write it down to get it organized from thoughts to paper.....     da idea happen chanced when i was thinkin about frames for the LubeTrend.com Project (don't worry, this post is protected so ONLY U, who is U, can see it)... if we are to utilize frames, let us utilize it to the fullest, eh!     my concept is this: utilizing 2 frames, let us call them TreeView and TreeLoader    TreeView contains (obviously) the view of the tree... da first "child" nodes of the root node is displayed (taken from the database)... not only are they displayed, they are also stored in an array (let us call these nodes RootChildrenNodeArray)... another array is created for children nodes (ChildrenNodeArray)...  TreeView communicates directly with TreeLoader by dynamically passing a parameter to it via QueryString and JavaScript.... TreeLoader takes this parameter and do a query on da database to gather another set of child nodes...  Once TreeLoader is finished loading up, it will call a JavaScript function in TreeView that basically tells TreeView to update the ChildrenNodeArray and RootChildrenNodeArray with the loaded information from the database... the function will then traverse the either the ChildrenNodeArray (if there are any children) and pass the new id as a QueryString parameter to TreeLoader...  the process is repeated until the RootChildrendNode has no more nodes left to check... in a sense, the data is streamed to the client dynamically... all in HTML and JAVASCRIPT!!!      damn, i'm tired... i want to write more on this, but my fingers are tired and my eyes r droopin.... sry mungs, i'm gonna hafta sign out for now.... i'll write more when i get a chance... any comments? any problems? let me know so i can address it... of course you may ask: does it work in netscape? i would respond, does it really matter? but instead i will say, yes, if we are careful enough in DHTML programmin' we shouldn't have any trouble with making this work for Netscape also.... anyhoo, pu is tired.... so pu will have 2 say good nite 2 y'all   © pu out ©

						      Damn! I just suddenly woke up from a dream... No, was it a nightmare??? No, maybe a dreammare... It was just a strange dream... Not one of the common repeatable dreams I normally have... I'm writing it down to while it's still fresh in my head... But the problem is I can't see...      Oh wait, I forgot my glasses... Hehehe.... Like I said, I just woke up; my eyes are half-closed, and my hair disheveled.... Well, lemme go into my first recorded dream..... As far as I can remember, it started out............   «  .......with Pu driving his car in downtown Portland. Pu was on his way to pick up his Dear from school. Looking at his watch, Pu thought he had a lot of time; so he decided to cruise around downtown a bit. He also gave his two friends, Dapimp and Lilj, a call because he was somewhat bored. They chit-chatted a while, laughing, making jokes, saying some nasty stuff about each other, you know, their normal routine chatting. Then Pu asked them if they want to meet up with Dear and him and go out and have some fun afterwards. They said alright and Pu told them to meet him up at school. Pu looked at the time again. It was getting close to picking Dear up.    «  Pu turned his car around to go back to school. On the way he saw somthing strange: a two-court tennis area with several people playing in it. The strange thing about it is that Chubby Lady was on one side of the first court and something like ten people were on the other side of the second court. Chubby Lady was making a boast that she could beat all of them in tennis even if they team up together at once. Pu guessed that's the reason why they were playing on two courts; there would have been no place to run for those people if they were playing on just one court. Strange indeed.    «  Yet, even stranger was that as Pu was driving, he "ran" into a guy wearing white button-up T-shirt with plaided lines and khakis, carrying a green bag and holding a strange item in his hands. The thing was that "running" into someone with a car isn't like "hitting" that person. Imagine that driving a car is just like walking. If you bumped into someone, they won't be mad or injured, but surprised as if you were bumping them in person. And it's a normal thing.......    «  Anyways, Pu recognized the face as one of his old highschool classmates, but can't really pinpoint the name. The Stranger, surprised, but happy, began to asked Pu some series of question. Irritated at being stalled from picking Dear up, Pu took the item that the Stranger was holding and toss it far away into the midst of traffic. It was mean of Pu, he knows it, but he has to pick up Dear on time or she'll be mad at him again.....    «  Pu droved on and finally arrived at school. He saw Dapimp and Lilj waiting for him there already. Strange, didn't he just called them like only a minute ago? Pu droved around the block for a parking spot, but no place showed up, not even a temporarily waiting spot. After what seemed like hours of driving (but is only a few minutes), Pu looked at the time again and he was running out. Feeling pressured and fustrated, he decided to drive a block down to find a parking space.......    «  One block, two blocks, three blocks, four blocks, five blocks... Still no parking space. What the hell is going on? There got to be at least one parking space somewhere, but not a single one can be found. Pu was compulsively sweating; he needs to find a place to park soon or his Dear is going to be mad. All he cared about is not making his Dear mad. Com'on, a parking place, pleeeeeaaaaaaase!!!!    «  Finally! He saw one in a parking lot. And it even has his name posted to a sign next to the empty parking space. "There is a god!" was all that Pu could think. He pulled into the parking lot and was about to park he car there, when...............  »     At this point, something happened in my dream. Maybe I woke up a bit, shifted my body, something, but the dream got altered in some ways. The strange thing is while I was dreaming I did not notice this inconsistancy; it was as if it hadn't changed at all, but upon waking up and writing it down, I just realized that there was a point in my dream that things got altered. You will see what I mean when you read up the rest of my dream.... And so the story continues.....   «  ............he noticed that the sign above the empty space didn't just say his first name. It had a "Ng" as a last name. That means the spot wasn't reserved for him but for some supposedly Vietnamese guy. Pu was definitely mad; to be balked by some stranger who dare has the same first name as he (Pu thought his name was highly unique). Fine then! He was quickly running out of time, and there is virtually no other parking space, so he decided to park there anyway. After all, it'll be just for a few minutes; no one will notice.    «  Pu quickly pulled his  shopping cart  into the parking space and detached himself from it. He snuck by security, fearing that if he got noticed he'll be force to drive his  shopping cart  away.  But after he got out of the parking lot quietly, he broke into a sprint.    «  Pu knew it was a far run, but he still ran anyway. He quickly look at his cellphone for the time. It was close, very close. Dear would be waiting for him any moment now. He has to make it; he can't be late again. Their relationship might depend upon it. It was a good thing that the path to her  workplace  is downhill....    «  Closer, he was getting closer.  Com'on Pu!  You can make it.  Just a little more....    «  BAM! He ran into the Stranger he met before. But again, physics was weird here. Neither Pu nor the Stranger fell back a few paces. It was just like a bumping into a wall and being glued to it instead of bouncing of it. Pu said sorry to the Stranger, but didn't recognized him immediately. However, the Stranger did.    «  During the incident, Pu dropped the all-important stylus for his PDA. For some odd reasons, it was extremely dear to him, as if it held his lifeforce. The Stranger picked it up; Pu asked for it back. The Stranger smiled and threw far away and into the midst of traffic. Angered, but with no time to do anything about it, Pu quickly ran after the stylus. It was bouncing here and there and getting hit by several cars, which is stranged in itself because instead of being caught by one of a car's many crevices, it bounce right off as if each car is surrounded by a bubble of air.    «  After a while, Pu was finally able to retrieved his stylus, but it was dented, scraped, and bent in all places. Still, he put it in his pocket and continued on his "quest" to not make Dear wait for him. There's still time.    «  He sprinted as fast as he could until he arrived at the tennis area he saw before. The Chubby Lady was still playing against those ten other players. She was killing them, perhaps literally. Pu could see bodies scrambled all over the concrete court. Balls were zooming back and forth at amazing speed. And the Chubby Lady looks as if she was not wasting any effort at all. In fact, she's playing with a racquet in one hand and horrendously huge burger in the other.    «  Pu looked around; the tennis area, surrounded by high climbing metalic fences, was wider than he thought (probrably to compensate for the size of the Chubby Lady). So wide was the area, that even after squinting, he could not see where it ends on either side. It was as if the tennis area was a barrier that he MUST get through before getting to  Dear's workplace . It doesn't look like there's any way to go about it. He has to go through the tennis area, dodge the onslaught of tennis balls, and reached the exit on the other side.    «  It was a crazy idea. But he had to do it. So, he prep himself, opened the gate and entered the danger zone. Approaching the danger carefully, Pu dodged the high-velocity balls the best he can. Halfway there, he noticed that the Chubby Lady was smiling at him. She had ugly, rotten teeth with maggots crawling about! Shocked and horribly terrified, Pu stumbled and hit the ground. But that ended up as a lucky stumble because an extremely high-speed ball was aiming straight for the back of his head before he stumbled. For the rest of the "trip" Pu had to crawled on his belly.    «  Finally, he reached his destination: the exit. Pu pulled himself back up and brushed the dirt of his clothes. He looked at the time: he got a few seconds left. Yes, he would make it. He DID make it. Beyond the exit was  Dear's workplace  and he would make it on time, for once.    Pu opened the door....    «  ....... and found himself in a desert with one or two houses around him. Surprised, Pu looked around; not a single soul could be seen. Even the door that he walked through disappeared. Where was he? What happened to Portland? How did he end up in a desert?    «  And then his cellphone rang; Pu picked it up.....  He heard Dear's sad voice on the other end....    «  "You're late.....  Again.............................."      And then I just woke up, not in sweat like I usually would from a nightmare, but in a horribly shocked state. But the dream was very powerful and I remember most of the detail. So instead of going back to sleep like I normally would, I got up and decided to write this blogs in hope that I can learn something from it.     I know that this dream conveys one thing to me: my fear of being late all the time. For a major part of my life, I've strived not to be late, not to make other people wait on me, but things never turn out the way it's suppose to and I end up late for a lot of things and a lot of reaons. Many times, it is my fault; I just don't know how to manage my time well enough. And sometimes it is not. But, I will continue to strive to find a better way to manage my time so that I don't consistently be late on what I do or postpone important stuff (like SCHOOL).     Hope you enjoy my first blogged dream!   © pu out ©

						      Yesterday, two or so hours ago, I shed tears that I thought were long gone...  And so did my younger brother, Thai...      Why, you may asked... It happened in just a matter of moments, a surge of feelings that were unbearable, which had to pour out... Hatred, sadness, lost, grief; they all filled me with a terrible pain that I had all but forgotten... The pain of a lost love one...      The memories were clouded and darkened by the passage of time... But time cannot vanquish it so easily... A spark, from what I did today, ignited the flames which made the memories so cyrstal clear that the sharp edges are like daggers to the heart... And so tears came streaming from my eyes without my knowledge as I was lost in thought, in a time long gone... And it was all because of an irony, a painful irony at that...    ****    It was a night unlike any other nights; my younger brother, my cousin and I had just finished some talked about family matters... As usual, I was discreet; I am not one for talking about about others behind their back or criticizing what they do unless what they do really pains me... But my brother, Thai, on the other hand, is heavily outspoken and stubborn when it comes judging people, which includes family...    I agreed with him on many points, but to call family members horrible names or cursing them just because they did or is doing something you feel is bad seemed a bit extreme to me... Respect is given, not earned... Someone does not need to earn your respect if you can give it... At the very least, you should give them the respect required of all humans, good or bad, and that is to respect them as human... But my brother holds a different view and we settled it at that...    We've talked for hours and by the time we were finished, I decided to do some computer work... But I needed to finished off some bill payments first... It was then that the painful memories flooded back in...    I was just finishing up paying for my cellphone bill on the Verizon Wireless website, when I noticed something peculiar... The website had his nifty little bar graph on the right side column which tells the user of how many minutes the user used for the past five months... And there it was, five letters, seemingly unconnected but spelling one word that I have not seen for a long time: J A S O N, the name of my deceased nephew who passed away when he was not more than a year old...    At first, it didn't click, but I slowly realized what the letter stood for: July, August, September, October, and November... I thought it was somewhat ironic once I figured this out... To have first letter of five months spell out your name; that seemed like an odd coincidence... But an even worst coincidence was the fact that Jason died on the very next month, December... And today (or yesterday, that is) was the very first day of the month of December...    Suddenly, loneliness and despaired crept up to my concious being... "Was it wrong of us to name him Jason? Did his name has something to do with him dying on the month of December? Could we have done something to prevent his death? What could I have done differently so that he may live? How could fate taken away such a precious little life and let those who has little life left bear such burden?"    Questions, memories, pain were rushing through the viens and nerves in my body as if I was being electrocuted... Jason was so young when he died... I could still remember holding his barely breathing body in my hands... I could still taste the sour memories of the countless tears that the family has shed because of him... And I could still hear the shrilling shriek that came from him, the shriek of pain that was not of hunger or sadness, but of lost... I can still see his dark cold eyes, staring into nothing as if he is staring right through me...    The memories were to much... I could not hold the tears back... For every drop that trickle down my eyes, once dried from the burden of life, I could feel the very beating of his extremely weak heart as if he was sitting right beside me... I welcomed that thought; even if he was a ghost, I would give anything to see him once again alive and bouncing like a regular baby...    But atlas, that cannot be... It was not meant to be... Still, I questioned fate and I questioned myself... Can life be so cruel to take away someone so precious? Can I bear each living moment knowing that I could do nothing to make the pain go away? But it is a burden that I must carry, forever; it is a sadness that will live in my heart always... I can do nothing about about it but carry it with me to my grave, as I will undoubtly carry on the burden of other sadness in my life... Perhaps this is what Atlas, the Greek God that carries the whole world on his shoulder, feels like for all of eternity...    At least I can rest knowing, I won't be carrying for all of eternity...    Such painful memories can be surpressed, but not forgotten... Now that I know the five months which spelled his name, I will constantly be reminded of him when the seasons come and go... Still, I am happy... I am happier knowing that something so precious will NEVER, NEVER be forgotten...    © pu out ©     ========    [[ Commented by thongtap on December 4, 2003 at 6:25 pm ]]    I kinda want to cry than to say anything. We are guys ok, we're not supposed to cry. Naaa, for something like this it's nothing better than letting it all out. I'm lucky that I've never experinced such despair, but I wish I did, so when the moment comes it wouldn't hurt so bad. Although, I have been through some painful moments, where there was nothing I can do to fix it. I know how painful it was. There is nothing like loosing your love ones. But in your case, it's worst b/c you will never get to see them again. Well, not physically but only in your heart. I wish you all the best buddy. Just know that we're always here for you.    pee out,    :)

						                had my first study group session with my development team at work... it was pretty interestin, albeit a little arkward as we didn't exactly know where to go about it...  the study was on writing requirements doc... we were supposed to read chapter 1 and 2 by today (of course, i slacked off on reading)... the chapters weren't all that interesting as it was basically giving out premises for writing this book and crud... but the discussion turned out pretty good...  we will continue doing this once every week, a couple of chapters a day until we know what is takes to be profecient in writing docs that will save our ass with future clients... popart suffers a great deal when it comes to designin and developing high ended systems for bigger clients... they do well with simple brochure-ware sites, but as much as they want to think that they are the best, they are suffering horribly with e-commerce websites, with the result being more costly to us than to the clients...  let's hope for the best then, eh?

						    "Help us, Ravien!  Help!"  "How?  I'm just a kid!"  "The Gift!  Use it!"  "No!  I can't!  I mean, I don't know how!"  "You did it once!  You can do it again!  Hurry, Ravien!  Please.  There is not much time!"  The Gift. Vyle's Accursed Gift as it is more commonly known by. Given to Hys' children as pennance for betrayal he had committed against the Chosen Kingdom in the Time of Lore. Children's tales, used to frighten kids to sleep.  It was said that Hys destroyed the barrier that had held the Dark Master, Vyle, prisoner for centuries. Vyle gave him the Gift so that he may plunge the world into darkness and despair. Hys, after seeing the chaos that ensued after his misdoings, used the power given to him by Vyle and turned it against the Dark Master, sealing Him back into the ageless prison. But before Vyle was locked up, the Dark Master placed a curse upon the Gift:  "For generations that come, for generations that goes,   the Gift can only bring certain death and tearful sorrows."  Ravien shooked his head. He cannot be thinking of history lessons right now. His family is in trouble and unless he can find something that will help them, he may loose them as well as his own life. This is definitely too much stress for a nine-year old boy to tackle!  The ring of fire was getting closer. Ravien could feel the heat radiating from the magical essence. Heat. Wait, that was the key: heat. He needs to burn the magical barrier that is blocking him from reaching for the Gift.   (To be continued)

						   as noted in my motto, the blogs that comes forth from this blogspot will consists of true events in my life, dreams, and of fantastical made-up stories in hopes that someday i can become a well versed storyteller...  to aid u in distinquishing which is which, i will write about my life events or thoughts in plain text,  while dream will be bolded ....   stories untrue will be told in italic...   hopefully this will help distinquish the great deal of blogs to come....  ===========   "a storyteller?" thinks the money-making fool.  "why not a writer?  u can make so much more money, man!"      "grandure and freedom is my ambition, friend" says pu.  "a writer is but a versioned storyteller, narrowed by the medium of words...  storytellers are the conveyors of dreams...  such grandure is what i seek..."      "bach!" came the murmur.  "sentimental old goat who has gone senile..."      "perhaps, especially since i'm talkin to myself..."  pu sighed.  "ah well, i can but live to catch the tide of words that is to follow..."

						   i've finished my backups of blogs tonight (or morning for those technically adept)...  last night i started and complete the livejournal.com backups (title of blog begins with "livejournal.com")...  tonight i did the same for xanga.com; albeit i had to create titles for...  check them out in my archives if u want to see the memories...  i also played with the template thingy a bit...  instead of use the browser font size, i decided to stick with a static font size of 12px...  this small font seemed to be a better fit for the style anyhow...  plus, i added an the "tao of pooh" image that i uploaded to xanga.com blog site...  that's so far the extent of my "creative endeavour"...  for the moment at least...  i will get around to customizing the site further when i get the time...  :)  for now, tho, enjoy the site and remember to "pu out" every now and then!!  =Þ

						   man, what a day...  it was disheartening in lots of ways...  a co-worker (soon to be ex-co-worker) expressed his general distaste of our workplace and for the most part, i would have to agree...  i didn't view it in such dislike as he would, but his words rings true...  how do u expect to work in a place in which rewards u not for the work u have done, but by the status of ur background?  don't get me wrong here; the environment in my workplace is great: the people are nice and friendly, the air at times are lively, and...  well, the people are nice and friendly...  but that's just the problem...  great people, bad company...  perhaps i am to be at fault for the great many mistakes made at popart; lord knows i've made quite a bit mostly from absent-mindedness or neglect...  and it is because of my involvement that things had gotten screwy at popart for i don't seem to hear of any "bad" deals that went before my comings...  but then again, i worked my ass off to get things done a great deal of time...  i just feel that for the commitments i've made and for the sacrifice i've given, it was all for naught...  immediate gratification just isn't there...  don't count me as a greedy bastid, just yet...  let me explain...  gratification comes in all shapes and sizes...  when i hold my pucademy courses and people there become wide eyes and happy, and they apply it from the boundaries of the class onto their everyday life, gratification comes to me in the form that i can see i am making a difference...  that has always been what i strive for in life...  to make a difference, perhaps not politically or internationally, but knowledgably and emotionally...  that, my friend, is what makes me happy and keep me going every day of my life...  but what of  urlLink pop art ?  do i seem to be making any difference?  perhaps...  perhaps without me, the would not get a lot of the things that went wrong to be right...  perhaps without me, people would be far sourer than they are now...  but then again, that's bein hella egotistical :P  i do not think that way...  my mind works in the fashion that with me, things have been different...  being difference doesn't necessary mean that i've made a difference in the preference that i would like...  the whole process is, in a nutshell, just hellacious to work with...  document this, document that, who's responsible for this, who's responsible for that...  we've worked more hours than we estimates...  that is bad...  that is very bad...  good news: they are changing to make it work better...  but will it become better?  and will the voice that i speak be heard among such changes?  i do not know and perhaps may never will...  all i know is this inkling feeling that it's turning out like my old workplace,  urlLink tak ...  how u may say?      they are spending money they dont have (meaning someone else's money) on renovating so as to make their company look better in the light of clients.  not a bad thing, if ur able to sustain a healthy income...        there are disgruntled employees, primarily in the field of respect, i.e. i've been here much longer than you, why should you get the "senior" status and be paid more than me, especially if i know so much more stuff than u?  this doesn't occur all that greatly at tak for we were a happy-go-lucky type of group...  but we were angry at the "special" treatment that some particular family member was getting...     shortening the estimate just so we can win the bid...  there's really only one sales guy that does that at pop art, and he's out of there...  so there's hope...     there's just way too many politics, i.e. we need a female programmer in our group to balance out the male hormones, etc...  i'd say we need a  good  programmer regardless of gender or race...  but there's no heed to what i say...     and the treatment of people like they are  part of a great company , instead of them as the  ones who creates a great company ...  regardless of the goodies that the Big Guy says, i.e. it is we who makes the company, etc...  the feeling is just not there to entice us to be part of it...  that is the reason for the great amount of turn overs, i dare say...    the list can go on...  but ah well, i shouldn't complain too much...  bad for the heart...  :)  i just dislike certain events today:      i had to put out two fires which were like VERY VERY LOW priority compared to the work i got, but some were making such a BIG fuss out of it...  damn them...  can't they see i got real work??     got an email from our "senior" developer about redline tasks...  god damn it...  it's all about images...  we need to get work done; for us to be bothered by some god damn red lines that are either in pending status and the PM just did not care to update it (not our fault damn it!  we told them already!), or such low priority, really gets to our guts...  and to top it off, it is coming from a "senior" developer in status only but not in knowledge really gets our seat jumping...  but we patiently stayed cool...     the depress feeling begotten from news of my co-workers about other co-workers and the company's status affected my work...  couldn't really concentrate and get any work done..  maybe jerms right...  i needn't hear things about other people, eh?     to top it off, in the staff meeting, to hear that my "recruiting bonus" will be paid in installments...  omfg!  recruiting bonuses is $500...  chunk changes...  i will get $250 in my next paycheck...  and the other $250 when the tom stay on for more than 3 months...  i say like WTF??  if i'm gone within those 3 months, i got cheated out of my $250...  i see da strategy, makin me stay an extra 3 months just collect it, but god damn it, i don't have to like it...     and lastly, i did not like the way they treated a PT contractor, albeit for security reasons...  they held a staff meeting and expected jeremy to work by himself instead of welcomin him to the group...  i thought that this was just plain freaking ass rude...  he hadn't need to stay for the whole staff meeting...  just perhaps to get introductions going...  i say it is always good to introduce even tho they may not be staying long...  it's just plain courtesy...  if i was in jerms position, i would feel shut out, that just because i was "just" a contractor, i needn't be made to feel welcome...  perhaps i'm looking too deeply into this, but they are my feelings and i'm sticking with 'em...    as you can see, my days have indeed becoming disheartening...  as much as i would like to make an excuse for pop art, i cannot make excuses for people's action there...  there are great people there, believe me, and even the big boss is great...  but i had thought the same of the big boss of tak in my early days, and looked where i ended up, almost right back where i started...  :(  ah problems...  what can i do about them, eh?  i know...  get the HELL out of web development and into game development...  god damn it, if i could just find the time...  ~pu

						    pu was standing in line at the cafeteria with some friends.  they were joking about nothing in particular.  after getting the food, he headed for the table where dear was sitting.  at that point, his friends disappeared strangely, probrably because he saw something that was not supposed to be there sitting at the table next to his dear: a cute boy.  unlike most other times, pu can see the face clearly this time.  spiky hair, black thick jacket (probably from gap or banana republic), a gray thin school bag slung across his shoulder.  he was the epitome of "coolness".  and to top it off, his face has a boyish charm to it that all girls would fall dead for.  you know, the type in which girlfriends would tell their boyfriends "Oh, he's sooo cute..." and their boyfriend would fall dead at their feet because of a heart ache (or a heart attack)...  anyhow, pu was distraught.  there was a cute boy sitting next to dear, talking with dear.  that cute boy was as bold as a tiger, and probably as cunning as one.  jealously filled pu's vein, but he schooled himself to calm down.  perhaps it was just a passerby awestrucked by dear's beauty and just having a conversation.  or perhaps it was just an old friend.  well, no matter, pu needs to go sit down.  standing there staring and looking like a goof would do him no good.  pu went to sit down at the table.  it was a bit strange for it was a long booth; pu sat directly across the cute boy, dear was to pu's left, sitting on a chair, although the booth was long enough for her to sit in.  the cute boy has a friend sitting next to him.  probably a crony.  but that friend was discrete: pu's greatest attention was on the cute boy (note: it was not because he's cute, but because he's a threat).  a conversation was struck.  pu don't remember much of it as he was tad angry at the presence of the cute boy and kinda shut off the volume to whatever he said.  pu keeps glancing across the table to see if there was anything going one with the cute boy and dear.  at that moment, pu realized he was not eating.  not wanting to be impolite at staring all the time, pu began to eat.  he occasionally glanced over here and there, but he continue to eat, albeit slowly.  then he notice the cute boy scooting close to the edge toward dear.  he let that be for a bit.  then he notice the cute boy reach out for something.......  pu peared over the edge of the table............  at that moment, tons of tiny but angry electrons rained at his cervertical cortex (the brain), making his face fiery hot: the cute boy placed his hand over dear's (which was on her lap at the time).  dear expression was of amazement, and she quickly pulled her hand away.  but pu didn't care.  jealously raged and got the better of him.  pu quickly stood up and brush all of the food on the table aside to the right.  the food, plates, and drinks slid smoothly off the table, creating a racketing sound...  yet, no one in the cafeteria paid them any heed.  he towered over the cute boy, eyes red, face hot, and muscle buldging (pu has muscles?  omg!  well it is pu's dreams after all, hehehe).  "what the hell do you think you're doing?" says pu to the cute boy.  he didn't answer.  was the guy deaf or something?  "keep your filthy hands off my girl!  if i see you do that one more time, i'll knock you cutesy head off!"  what was pu doing?  he never gotten this mad before, and he never says those sort of corny lines.  but then again, he watches way too much movie sometimes.  the cute boy never answered.  he just got up, looked at pu, gave him a smirk, glanced at dear, and walked off in a different direction, away from them.  even his walk was cool.  his friend followed him like a lapdog.  damn those cute and cool boys!  after they walked off, pu turned to dear, his temper still in full mount.  that probably was not a good idea.  "who the hell was that guy?  are you seeing another guy while you're seeing me?"  "so what if i am?" says dear without expression or emotions.  at those words, pu tempered subsided; hopelessness and despaired filled his heart.  was he to loose his dear?  was all that he ever did for her for naught?  what did he do wrong?  or was it what he  didn't  do?  he hadn't changed much except for growing fatter and less responsible, pu felt...  was that it?  was she leaving pu for the cute boy???????  noooooooooooooooo!  not a cute boy.....  a smart one was okay, he guess.... but not a cute boy............!!!!  pu slunked.   he was as quiet as sleeping baby...  perhaps that was all he was, pu thought...  a big sulking baby...  pu glanced up and saw dear walking away...  was she walkin in the same direction where the cute boy went?  he couldn't really tell.....  the tears were blurring his eyes...  tears?  what tears?!  he was a man for god's sake!!  men don't cry no more....  angered beyond recognition, pu slammed his fist on the edge of the booth......  for some odd reasons, he had strengths far greater than he had realized...  the booth flipped over his head and landed just a hair strand behind him (this may have been a recollection from the "Hellboy" movie pu had recently seen).  pu then stood up, took some money from his wallet (apparently pu was also rich) and just threw it behind him to pay for the damaged he caused (also seemed like one of those movies cliche that invaded the dreams)...  afterwards, all was dark and pu eyes opened......................

						   i had some sleep problems last night...  i keep tossing and turning for no obvious reasons...  i slept well for the first five hours, but then i woke up (i set my alarm clock to wake up at five to do some work work, but my internal clock woke up like 5 minutes before it rang) and couldn't really go back to sleep...  neither could i actually wake up...  keep tellin myself like 5 more minutes...  damn it...  the weird thing was that in that awake/sleep mode, my mind was racing through some really weird stuff...  sometimes i think i'm going crazy...  odd things just come and go in my head...  sometimes guilt for not waking up to do some work, sometimes anger for waking up to do some work...  it was extremely tormenting and i couldn't really get a full 5 minutes of sleep...  and so i keep delaying...  5 o'clock, 5:30, 6 o'clock, 6:30...  finally, i could get soooome sleep...  but the sleep was much more dreading then my half-sleep encounter...  within 5 to 10 minutes, i entered REM sleep and dreamt...  for a full 30 minutes, the dream turned into a terrifying nightmare that woke me up in despair...  but..................  i will have to tell you about the nightmare in my next post...  i'm a tad bit late for work.... :P

       Jerms woke up from a deep sleep to find he was still dreaming. Or was he? He looked out the window. It was a clear night, his room lit by the moonlight streaming through the window. Long shadows cast on the wall formed shapes of unmentionable things. He looked over at the clock….. 3:33pm. "What the...?" Jerms thought. “If it's 3:33pm, it can't be dark outside. Ok, so obviously, I'm still in a dream. Guess I'll close my eyes and see if I wake up for real this time.”  In that split second of time it takes for Jerms to close his eyes, he sees one of the shadows on the wall move. His eyes are now closed. He tries to open his eyes to find out what the shadow was, but they do not open. His eyes are shut tight by an unseen force. Jerms strains his eyelid opening muscles to open them. Even all that training in the eyelid Olympics could not prepare him to counter this strength. He gropes in the darkness and puts his hands to his eyes. “Ah! Who’s there! Help! Can’t…..open….”   Jerms’ eyes open. He is still in his room, but everything is all wrong. Shadow and light are reversed. What once was shadow is now solid and clear. Things that were once solid are now dark and fuzzy. He looks at his own hands, they too have turned to shadow, and are blurry around the edges. Jerms notices someone staring at him, and gives a little yelp.  “I am Pu of the shadow world. Welcome,” says the figure standing only a few feet away.  Oddly, the man looks vaguely familiar to Jerms. “Do I know you from somewhere? Oh I get it. Of course. I’m dreaming. We always see familiar faces in our dreams.” Jerms is trying hard to be logical about it. “So... perhaps you could give me the standard explanation-of-what’s-going-on speech at least?” Jerms asks.  “Yes. I was just about to get to that. You have entered the world of what’s seen in your world as shadow. To you, our world is seen as shadow. To us, your world forms our shadows. Since you have managed to foolishly land yourself in our world, you have turned into a shadow. Quite interesting actually.”  “OK this is kinda cool, but creeping me out. I really need to wake up now,” jerms says. But something deep inside his brain tells him he is already awake.

        welcome one welcome all to the pj stories blog... here you will find random stories generated by two of the greatest figures unknown to mankind: pu &amp; jerms... sometimes the stories connects... sometimes they are vastly different... it all depends upon the moods of the authors... one day perhaps, order will be sorted from chaos and the authors will be rich from the stories they generated... but until then... enjoy!
