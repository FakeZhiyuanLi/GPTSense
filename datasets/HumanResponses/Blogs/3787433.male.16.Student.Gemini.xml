      We ain't B-Boys but we dance to live. When we dance to live, the dance's the give. We ain't Hip-Hop artist but we rap to Survive. When We rap to survive, the rap is what keep us alive. So what if there's other gender. We're the best holding it down together. Can't let it go. But we got to free it. Free it when we kick it. When we kick it, it's freestyle. Free to move, sing and rap is our style. The best is always the best. Ya'll poser better go and rest.  Get Ready For WAR Inc... 1st stop:  Vanue - Queenstown Secondary School Event - Quest Talent Time 2004
