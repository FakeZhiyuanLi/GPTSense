        Big mistake.  Yesterday I swelled up like a mofo due to an allergic reaction to my many many mosquito bites (I look like I have measles or some skin disease) so at my coworkers' urging, I ran off to the pharmacy and bought some antihistamine and took one right away.  I could barely keep my eyes open, even by the end of the day when I was driving home.  Just my luck, it was the one day I got stuck in traffic.  I was literally slapping myself to try to stay awake.  *sigh*  Today I didn't take any antihistamine so that I can actually get some work done.  I sure hope that the swelling goes down by tomorrow night...

        I decided to do a separate post for my gastronomic outing with the couples...  I started off with the Sambuca prawns, which were absolutely delicious.  My only beef with them was that there were so few (I think there were only 5) for $12.  Each prawn had a little pile of green cavier on it, and was covered with a yummy cream sauce.  For my entree, I had the seabass despite my craving for red meat.  I opted for the seabass because since it is on the verge of extinction, not many restaurants serve it!  :(  Sucks because it is my favourite fish.  I was mildly disappointed with it, maybe because I have such high expectations of it from having it at Deep Cove Chalet (in Sidney, BC).  The menu said that it was served with an Asparagus cream sauce, but I didn't see or taste any sauce on my dish!  Jenn ordered the Alcatraz pizza, which had pesto and scallops - a much better choice than my entree.  El and Jimmy ordered the prawn and scallop penne, which was also better than my entree.  Sean ordered the veal tenderlion, which was alright.  In the end, my recommendations would be to stick to the appetizers, pizza, and pasta.  I recall I had the rack of lamb last year and it was also just so-so.  For dessert, I ordered the chocolate decadence which was supposed to serve 2, but when it arrived it was so tiny that I finished it on my own.  Jenn and Jimmy split one and Jenn still wanted more dessert after they finished it.  It was THAT small.  I was a little astonished that single me spent the same amount as Jenn and Jimmy combined!  Not sure how THAT happened...  As for the music, it was not bad, but we all agreed that we'd prefer to hear that style of music (blues) at a bar or a pub; over dinner, we prefer to listen to jazz vocalists (i.e. Jennifer Scott, Karin Plato), or something more intimate.    As always, it was an enjoyable night, filled with many interesting, stimulating, and thought provoking conversations.  I finally found someone to go to the Josh Groban concert with me: Jenn!  Before tonight, I was starting to think that my taste in music was really old because the only other people I could find that wanted to go were my PARENTS!  Imagine that!  Having the same taste in music as your parents... *shudder* I am thinking of hitting up more piano concerts; unfortunately I missed the Ling Ling concert, but I'll be sure to attend the next brilliant pianist who comes.  Preferably Chopin, would be great. :)

        Another beautiful weekend!  We are so spoiled to have such great weather despite grim forecasts!  Friday, a friend came back to town so we hit up Plaza and had some good times, good times.  Got home after sunrise and was hungover and sleepy for most of Saturday, which I spent sleeping on the beach.  Although I was at the beach for several hours, I did not seem to get any darker.  I have this feeling that I've reached the darkest I can possibly get.  Had dinner at Little Mexico Cantina in Steveston on the patio and got 10 mosquito bites (I counted).  My blood must be really sweet or something because out of the 3 of us, I was the ONLY one who got attacked!  My other friends didn't get any bites!  To make matters worse, I'm allergic to mosquito bites so they are ALL swollen.  The one on my right ankle is the size of a mandarin orange and makes me look like I have one "cankle" (defn: when your ankles are so fat, they look like calves - taken from the movie "Shallow Hal").  I have 5 on my right arm/shoulder, 2 being in my armpit area and the one on my shoulder blade being the size of a golf ball.  I even have one on my scalp!  Not sure how that one got there...  Sunday, I went to my Accounts Receivable job in Delta because month end is coming soon and had a very productive day.  I owe my productivity to all those coffees I chugged prior to leaving the house.  After work, I rushed home to get ready for my 5th wheel dinner at Capone's.  All in all, a good weekend!  The only thing that would have made my weekend better is if I got home earlier on Friday night and wasn't hungover the next day... but no regrets, it was a fun night :)

        The moment has finally arrived:  I got an internal job offer today!  Actually, I knew about it a week ago because my boss tipped me off, but I had to keep it on the down-low until it was officially announced.  The whole HR department went through a reorganization and as the result, many current employees who already had jobs, had to apply to the newly created positions.  I consider myself very fortunate to have landed a position because I am only a "Casual" (i.e. on-call) employee and therefore am last in the pecking order.  Although the job offered to me is temporary (i.e. only for a specified term), it seems very likely that it will be for a fairly lengthy period because the person who "owns" the position I received is on assignment in a different position and she still has a lot of work to finish off.  I will find out how long my term will be for on Monday, after my boss meets with her boss.  Also, this job bumps me up in the pecking order for "regular full-time" jobs; I am now second!  AND, I may be eligible for benefits finally!  I may be able to fix my bum knee finally!  :)  Oh, to be healthy and active again!  Woohoo!  Now, this does not mean that I have finally decided to switch over to HR;  since it is a temporary position, I still have the opportunity to switch back into IT once more internal IT positions to come out.  Plus, my boss expects me to leave if I land an IT position and she is totally cool about it; she just wants what is best for me and for me to be happy.  Too bad all bosses aren't like her!  I'm glad that she is going to be my new boss because then I won't have to worry about burning any bridges when and if I leave the department.  I will continue to try to get an IT position within the organization because I feel that there is more growth in that area for me, considering my background, skills and education; with no real HR education or training, I feel that my success in the department is limited unless I go back to school.  Of course with every good news, comes a big reward.  I went shopping today and bought a couple tops, a pair of shoes that I had been eyeing for awhile, an anklet, and.... (here comes the REAL reward)... another diamond ring!  :)  It is a 18kt white gold 0.25ct GH diamond solitaire.  The quality of the diamond is really nice and it sparkles a lot!  As some of you know, I seem to like rewarding myself with diamond rings; this is the second time I have done so in the past year.  AND once again, I got suckered into buying it because the salesperson knocked off some extra dollars to sweeten the deal.  Originally I wasn't going to buy myself my jewellery reward until I receive news about how long my term will be for and after I negotiate my salary, but I couldn't resist a good deal!  At least buying jewellery is a good investment... a lot better than buying clothes...

       ... hardly.  I had my 5 seconds of fame today as an extra for Global National.  My friend works for the show and was doing a story on the growing popularity of poker.  It is going to air this coming Tuesday June 29 @ 5:30PM on Channel 11.  Look out for me!  I'm the token female player who schools all the other (male) players and actually jumps up with my hands in the air cheering when I got a 3-of-a-kind.  Or was that the time when I got a straight.  Either way, ladyluck was on my side when the camera was rolling. :)  When the camera stopped rolling and we started betting money, it was a different story.  I lost $5.  Oh well, it was fun.  I think I discovered a new (cheaper) weekend activity to replace clubbing.  :)  We are going to play every weekend, I think.  See you in the casinos!  Just kidding...

             What a beau-T-ful weekend!  I think I was home for a total of 5 hours (minus sleeping time) all weekend.  It was a good fun-filled, action-packed, productive weekend!  Friday, went shopping right after work.  Bought a purse. :)  I've been eyeing it for awhile and it was 40% off.  PLUS my boss tipped me off about a job offer coming my way soon... so I felt rich and indulged, once again.  Went to Boathouse and sat on the patio and ate oysters (Malepeques, of course!) while watching the sunset over English Bay.  Beautiful night!  Saturday, went to the beach like the rest of the world.  Played some beach volleyball, threw the frisbee around until I broke a nail, ate popsicles, tried skim boarding - bundles of fun!  I might very well get hooked on it!  I still haven't gotten the hang of it yet, but I haven't fallen yet and I have been making progress!  Unfortunately I had to cut my skim boarding lessons short because I had to rush home and get ready for Tracy's birthday.    We went to La Bodega for dinner and the food was excellent, as usual.  My recommendations:  the potato salad, paella (apparently you need to pre-order it), mushrooms, red snapper, prawns, sangria - everything I have tried so far has been absolutely delicious!  The potato salad has capers in it so it makes it tastier than the traditional way.  Afterwards, we hit up Caprice (as usual) and got a little tipsy.  I blame the liquid cocaine nazi (Jan), and that not-so-beautiful shot of "Beautiful" (Grand Marnier and Hennessy) I was FORCED (and egged on) to drink.  Now, for those who know me well, you know that I have not been able to go near Whiskey since that FIFO boat cruise where I consumed way too much Crown; this night was no different, and as expected, I couldn't keep it down.  Ick.  Sunday, went to work.  :(  Such a crime to work on a beautiful day!  But there were tons of cheques that needed to be entered before month end and I can't finish them all in the last weekend of June (there's way too many).  Afterwards, took my folks out for dinner at Tropika for Dad's Day since both of my brothers were in L.A. (lucky bastards).  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TRACY!!

       Every year, I've managed to attend one dinner performance.  This year, I'm planning on perhaps hitting up a concert or two, as well as a couple dinner performances.  There are a couple performers that I want to check out, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to check them all out, so I guess I'll have to pick and choose:      Oscar Peterson : Fri Jun 25 8PM @ The Orpheum   Tickets are a bit pricey ($75-$95), I think.  But I think it'd be worth it, if I manage to find someone to willing to fork out that much to see him.      Karin Plato Quintet : Fri Jun 25 8PM @ O'Doul's / Tue Jun 29 8:30PM @ Cascades (Pan Pacific)   I've never heard her perform, but I've heard that she's really good.  She's a JUNO-nominee too!      Jacksoul : Thu Jul 1 8PM @ The Centre   I've never heard her perform, but I've heard that she's really good.  She's a JUNO-nominee too!      Jennifer Scott Trio : Sat Jul 3 8PM @ O'Doul's   I heard her perform at Monk McQueen's awhile back, and she was just amazing!  She has the most amazing smooth soulful voice... very similar to Lauren Hill.  And she plays the piano at the same time - very talented!  Her voice is so amazing that you get goosebumps from listening to it.  Okay if you aren't into music like I am, you probably don't know what I am talking about.  Supposedly O'Doul's food is only so-so and the atmosphere is kind of fu-fu (in order words, stuffy), but in my opinion, her performance will make up for it!  Probably one of my favourite Jazz performers.      I have 5th wheel dinner plans with some friends next weekend (took us over a month to coordinate our availabilities and find a day that works for all of us), so we decided to double up and hit up the jazz festival while we're at it.  We were going to go to Ouisi but then we decided to check out Capone's again because the food was tasty when we went last year.  I wouldn't mind checking out Ouisi one day though; I hear their food is nice and spicy, just the way I like it! :)  Wes "Bluesman" Mackey is performing at Capone's that night, I'll let y'all know how he is.    Anyone know of any performers worthy of seeing?  For more information on the Jazz Festival, visit  urlLink www.coastaljazz.ca/jazzfest2004/

Oh and if you leave a comment, please leave your name so I don't think you're a stalker and nuke off your comment. :)  I might do a Yogathon!  All proceeds from this event will support the Western Canadian Pediatric AIDS Society and help send HIV/AIDS impacted children to Camp Moomba. 108 Sun Salutations... I hope I don't die! (just kidding).  I've never actually done yoga before but I'm going to attend my first yoga class with a friend tomorrow and then I'll decide whether or not I'll be able to survive the Yogathon...

       As of recent, I have been sitting at a crossroad in my career.  For all who have been living under a rock, although my education and my work experience is primarily in the IT field, the job I am currently employed in is in HR - very not IT-related.  Due to the poor market conditions, instability, and high competition in IT, I have been contemplating going into either HR or Accounting because I have a couple hook-ups that can get me jobs in those fields.  Here is my dilemma:  There is a position opening up in my department that I have a shot at getting.  The pay is better than most IT jobs available to someone with my education and experience, my coworkers are awesome, and my boss rocks (she doesn't want me to leave the organization so she is trying to find me a permanent job); however, I am afraid that I will not feel challenged in this role and usually get bored if I'm not challenged enough.  Ideally, an IT job within the organization would be perfect, but if I am not able to find one in time, I will have to choose between an HR job or a lower paying IT job elsewhere.  The thing is, I am very reluctant to take an entry level IT job because I have a lot of IT experience from all my co-op jobs.  On the flip side, I probably don't have enough IT experience to be able to land an IT job of the calibre that I have been used to; it is more likely that I'd only be able to get a lower-paid higher-end IT job.  I suppose I have been too fortunate for my own good in the past, landing a ludracris consulting contract right after graduation.  So it all boils down to that burning question:  Would you rather have a boring job that pays well or a challenging job that doesn't pay very well?  Being the type of person who is driven by challenge, I have always thought my answer would be the latter, but now that I am actually in the situation and have experienced the former, it is not so easy to take the pay cut.  I have a few friends in more  "challenging" jobs who are getting progressively disgruntled over their earnings, and as the result, actually decreased their productivity levels to match their salaries.  Perhaps if I wasn't so adament on being financially independant from my parents, I'd sacrifice the fat cheques at the drop of a dime for the chance to use my noggin.    Now, I think there are more elements involved in the answer to that question -  the atmosphere, potential job growth, the people, internal job opportunities, benefits, location, stability.  What one perceives as "challenging" and "interesting" may change over the course of time.  I used to prefer locking myself in my office so that I could code all day long without talking to anyone.  But now, after working in HR, I realized that I enjoy interacting with others,  I enjoy communicating with others, and I enjoy working closely with others; no longer do I aspire to be the hermit in the back room programming away.  At the urging of my boss, I have applied for the HR positions, as well as a few IT positions.  I suppose I'll take things one step at a time and decide when the time comes...

       OMFG  The stupid rhinestone fell off my cheap Chanel sunglasses!  And I don't know where the little gem is so that I can glue it back on!  Word of advice... don't buy Chanel sunglasses with rhinestones glued on them!  Time to buy a new pair... apparently those big plastic glam ones are coming back in... Any suggestions?

       I went shopping... again.  I have been unsucessfully trying to ban myself from shopping for at least a month, but barely lasted half a week.  The longest I've gone without buying an item was probably about 2 weeks (around 1 month ago or so), after which I went thru withdrawal and went crazy in Bebe.  To date, I've only worn 1 of the 7 tops I bought that day. =P  For tonight's shopping excursion, I blame Jan (just kidding).  Actually, the only reason why I agreed to go shopping was because there was a sale at Aritzia and you know how I can't resist a good sale... To my defense, the 7 items I bought cost less than the 7 tops I bought from Bebe, and all items were on sale and practical.    I'm absolutely terrible, I keep buying things and forgetting about them.  I have a closet full of unworn clothing, shoes, and clothing I've only worn once.  I don't feel quite as bad knowing that someone else I know has the same forgetful problem I have (*ahem* Jan *ahem*).  At this rate, I'm going to be living out of my car...

       Could it be? Have I really escaped the wraths of the gambling itch?  Last night, when Mon and I went back to the Casino, an older man in the parkade warned us, "Save your money, girls! No one is winning tonight!" We thought that he was just an unlucky bastard and laughed and walked away, but little did we know that he was correct.  When we got inside, Mon immediately went to play her once-lucky Underground Money machine, aka the "mole game", but like the previous casino visit, it was no longer lucky for her. She fared a bit better on Money Storm, my once-lucky machine that won me $111, but greed consumed the both of us and we refused to cash out despite being up $20.  I went to play Wheel of Fortune because a couple of my friends had won on those machines, but it wasn't lucky for me. I tried my hand at the blackjack tables, where I had a bad blackjack experience due to a bossy tablemate who claimed he was "teaching" me, but only managed to piss me off. He would tell me when to play and when not to play, when to stand, when to hit, and when to double down. At first, I hesistantly listened to him, but soon after I rebelled like a child, and purposely did what he did not want me to do, just to prove a point. Well that didn't pay off, and I ended up busting my way off the table. Oh well, c'est la vie. The whole table seemed to feel that because I kept busting, I was the reason why they lost since I "took" the cards that could had been theirs (and the dealer's); unbeknownst to me, this was apparently some of sort "blackjack strategy" that I was unaware of.  By the end of the night, Mon and I both lost, and left the casino depressed, a drastic constrast to our giddy behaviour from the beginning of the night. No longer did we feel the urge to win back our losses; instead, we saw gambling as it is: a dangerous addiction. I am still up $50 in the long run. Perhaps I should quit while I am ahead!

       Ladyluck is on my side :)   Went into work (accounting job) around noon.&nbsp; Productive day.&nbsp; Shame that I couldn't enjoy the beautiful weather though :(&nbsp; Went out for Pho afterwards with Mon and Tre, then gelato.&nbsp; I had my usual Coconut, as well as Cappacino and Rum and Praline Nuts.&nbsp; The Rum and Praline Nuts tasted like rum balls.&nbsp; It was good, but I got tired of it after 2 spoonfuls.&nbsp; The other 2 flavours were delicious :)&nbsp; Amatto Gelato rocks!&nbsp; Much better than Mondo, in my opinion.   Went to the Casino again!&nbsp; Played on the Cops 'n Donuts 5 cent slot machine and won won won!&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Put in a total of $30, and cashed out $100.25, winning a net amount of $70.25.&nbsp; I&nbsp;could have cashed out around $150 but I got greedy and kept playing and went down to around $75 and then back up to $100.&nbsp; Machine #2148 is my lucky machine -&nbsp;I will remember that!&nbsp; Tre won $175 in like 2 minutes on the machine 2 down from me!&nbsp; Lucky bitch!&nbsp; It made me get greedier and want to win more and more money haha.&nbsp; After the Casino, did the high school thing and drank a bit&nbsp;in&nbsp;the school field with John and his friends haha   I find that slot machines are like video games, especially when you get those bonus rounds!&nbsp; On the Cops 'n Donuts game, there are 2 bonus rounds:&nbsp; in the speed trap bonus round you get pulled over for "making too many credits in a x credit zone" and you have to select 3 excuses which are worth varying amounts of credits; in the donut eating bonus round you select which donuts the cop is to eat, and depending on his satisfaction level and how fat he becomes determines the number of credits you win.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is funny because you see the buttons on his shirt start to burst if you feed him a lot.   So far, this is the most I've made from the casino.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Hopefully I can get 4-digit winnings (before the decimal place) soon!&nbsp; That would REALLY make my day!

            Beach day :) Learned that Demand > Supply for water guns.  Went to Spanish Banks where Cor and I tried to start a water fight and avenge on Bri (Vuong) for dumping water balloons at her a couple years back when she was wearing a white T-shirt. Unsuccessful. He just stood there and took everything! Or else he'd whine about not getting his blanket wet. *sigh* Bri (Liu) came by with his Super Soaker and I played the role of beach bully and attacked many (unarmed) people, hosing them with the 20x setting. Fun stuff! So fun to be a bully... I bought 2 waterguns for Cor and I to use before heading out to the beach but they SUCKED! Apparently water guns at this time are hot commodities because Toys 'R Us was SOLD OUT of Super Soakers and all other decent guns! They only had one type of gun left, and it was faulty; it was supposed to be a "4 barrel gun" where you attach 3 little guns to the 1 big gun and when you press on both triggers, all water would shoot out of all 4 guns, but when you press on the front trigger, the 2 little guns would pop out 75% of the time! AND the gun's water streams had very poor range and endurance. I am going to try to return both of them, because the 2 little guns are NOT supposed to fall off when you press on the trigger! Broke ANOTHER nail that also gushed blood and throbbed (it is still throbbing days later). :( It hurts!  At night, went to Moxie's on Robson for May's and Cor's join birthday party. The service was pretty shotty; from my impression, their attitude was, "you are LUCKY to have made a reservation with us and even luckier if we fulfill it!" Cor made a reservation for 25, which was split into 2 tables, and they gave away one of the (smaller) tables! And the hostess was all self-righteous and gave us attitude about it! She said that we were late but they didn't even warn us! And our waitress originally told us that the other table was ours! I ordered the ribs, but I was still hungry afterwards so I ate half of May's pasta. The food was only so-so, most likely because we had a large party and they like to bring all the food out at the same time so most of the dishes were sitting under heat lamps cooking for extended periods of time. Pat ordered her steak medium well and it arrived well done! So she sent it back... it was a chew toy!  After dinner, went to Balthazars for some drinks. Cor got another muffdive, and a blowjob, and May got 2 muffdives. I took a lot of pictures with Cor's camera but I doubt she will post them.  Another busy day where I was running around from one event to another....

            I would give it perhaps 4 out of 5 stars... it was good, but not "one of the best". To make it into my 5 star group, all dishes have to be consistently outstanding, not just a handful of the items on the menu. To date, the only restaurants that I would consider to be 5 star, are Deep Cove Chalet (in Sydney, BC 10 minutes away from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal) and Gotham's Steakhouse.  To start, I ordered the Appetizer Trio, which came with a cold tomato soup, smoked black cod, and tuna tartare. I really enjoyed each item of the trio. Although the soup reminded us of salsa sauce, it was refreshing and had a kick of spicyness. The smoked black cod was very flavourful and moist, served with chopped cherry tomatoes and baby shrimp. The tuna tartare was lightly dressed with sesame oil and there was a nice balance between the taste of the tuna and the taste of the oil. I tried some of Mon's Rockshrimp and Shiitake Mushroom Springroll, but preferred my trio platter over it.  For my dinner, I opted for the rack of lamb, done medium rare (as usual). It was good, but still not as good as the one at Deep Cove Chalet. I think what it lacked was seasoning. I sampled some of Jan's Seared Halibut, and found that it was dry and flavourless. However, the Gnocchi that came with the chicken was very good, as were the mashed potatoes.  For dessert, Cor and I split the panna cotta. It was a bit too heavy for my liking; the butter flavour was a bit too prominent. Not sure if that's how all panna cottas are, or if it was because there was white chocolate in it, but I think I'll have to try it elsewhere to see if it's any better.  The company was by far, the best though (as usual) :) Cor liked her gifts and wore mine and Jan's gift the next day. Plenty of pictures were taken, many of which were candid shots courtesy of Christine. Mabel bought Cor a muffdive. I will try to get Cor to post the pictures of that, but I highly doubt she will. After dinner, we went to the casino where I lost $20. Jan and Mabel were the only lucky ones that night. Apparently 5 minutes after Jan left the slot machine, the women right after won the $5000 jackpot!! Jan felt a bit cheesed off about that, because it could have been HER!  Next day, Cor's birthday part 2 out of 3...

       I heard the most exciting rumour today!&nbsp; I heard from a friend that works at Holt Renfrew, that they are opening a Dior boutique!&nbsp; Not sure when it is to open... but I hope soon!&nbsp; Only problem is that all the Dior-deprived Vancouverites are going to go Dior-crazy and pretty soon it is going to be so mainstream!&nbsp; I think I better wear my purse as much as possible, while it is still remotely unique...  I couldn't resist... I bought that pink D&G purse that I have in black today!&nbsp; So now I have it in both colours.&nbsp; I bought it so I could use it to go to work, but I just realized that it doesn't fit as much as I thought it would..... ack oh well, too late.  Oh and I tried Capones again today, and the Sambuca Prawns are still very yummy!&nbsp; So far, very consistent... the crab cakes were good too!&nbsp; But as Jan said, it's hard to screw up crab cakes!

       I love snacking - potato chips, in particular.&nbsp; I have always thought that potato chips would single-handedly force me to shop at plus sized stores because once I eat one, I eat the whole 200g bag!&nbsp; This bad habit of mine was fine when I was young, but I am no spring chicken anymore -&nbsp;&nbsp;my body can't burn it off&nbsp;as quickly!&nbsp; Now, cutting out all snacking is just being unreasonable -&nbsp;especially around certain times of the month -&nbsp;so I went on a search to find healthy snacking (virtually guilt-free) alternatives.       Spudz Potato Crisps    Pretty tasty, tastes like rice cakes.&nbsp; I tried the Salt & Vinegar ones and they were a bit addictive.&nbsp; If you don't want the skin in your mouth to peel, perhaps try a different flavor.     Snackwell's Potato Crisps    One of the better "healthy" snacks, in my opinion.&nbsp; The Garden Tomato flavor is good.&nbsp; I haven't tried any of the other flavours though.    Cheerio's Snack Mix    I really like the Honey Nut flavoured ones.&nbsp; I also tried Lightly Dressed and Hot 'n Spicy but they pale in comparison to Honey Nut!    Vegetable Thins    Pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend eating them after eating Spudz&nbsp;(or any other snacks with&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;MSG)&nbsp;or else they taste a bit flavourless.   Another&nbsp;bonus?&nbsp; You won't feel as crappy after eating these snacks... at least I don't.&nbsp;

       Awesome weather!&nbsp; Lovin' it!&nbsp; Discovered the&nbsp;thrills and joys of gambling!  &nbsp;  Friday, planned on going to Sophia's dragonboat fundraiser at Skybar, but ended up going to Wet and Aqua for Viv's birthday.&nbsp; Aqua was alright... I only had fun because my friends were there and we were engaging in some heavy drinking.&nbsp; The scene is too pretentious there, but I expected that, with all the asians there.&nbsp; It was silicone city!&nbsp; Man oh man!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Saturday, went to the beach for some skimming, volleyball, and the highlight of my day - a big ass water fight!&nbsp; One of the guys brought a big duffel bag full of waterguns so we all grabbed one and engaged in a widespread battle!&nbsp; I was the only one who used war tactics though... I aimed for their earholes and used the bypassing pedestrians as a human shield.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Must have picked up those techniques from all those years watching Counterstrike.&nbsp; Half of my nail ripped off when I was playing volleyball and it was gushing blood and throbbing with pain.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Hopefully my nail grows back soon...  &nbsp;  Saturday&nbsp;night, went to Gabe's birthday BBQ where I got at least 8 mosquito bites even though I wasn't sitting on the grass.&nbsp; Right now, the one on the back of my thigh swelled up to the size of an orange!&nbsp; Looks like I'm going to be back on my anti-histamines... After we ate the cake, some of us played the Taboo board game I had bought him for his birthday.&nbsp; Fun game!&nbsp; We used to play Cranium ALL the time, but we went through the whole deck of cards and started remembering the answers so it isn't as much fun anymore... I figured that it was time for a replacement!&nbsp; And now we have one!&nbsp; Jan and I kicked ass, being the English vocabulary pros that we are.&nbsp; But we were on opposing teams, so at least it was a bit more fair... (my team won though, of course haha).&nbsp; Afterwards, we went to Viv's birthday part 2.&nbsp; Met up with them at (I'm actually embarassed to admit this) Atlantis, had a few drinks there, then went to Tonic where we ended our night.&nbsp; The drinks were very very watered down because I must of had 15-20 shots and I was feeling alright.&nbsp; Plus, we had our usual Liquid Cocaine shooters and they didn't burn on the way down like they usually do.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sunday, went for Dim&nbsp;Sum with my usual weekend lunch crew (Andrew, Pat &amp; co.) at Top Gun.&nbsp; It was alright... we were all still hungry afterwards though.&nbsp; The shrimp ricerolls weren't very fresh, but the beef ricerolls were good.&nbsp; Afterwards, went with Andrew and Pat to get sunglasses because Pat knows the owner of this optical store and can get a really good deal.&nbsp; I picked out 2 pairs and couldn't decide between them so I bought them both!&nbsp; Saved $40 for buying both anyways :)&nbsp; The first pair are Chanel with black plastic frames and a gradiant blue lens.&nbsp; The second pair are Versace, with the wire framing only the bottom of the lens, instead of the top like it normally is; essentially they look like they are upside-down.&nbsp; On each&nbsp;side is the Versace logo studded with rhinestones.&nbsp; The lenses are lightly mirrored.&nbsp; Both are very unique, funky styles.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sunday&nbsp;night, went to Cactus for drinks.&nbsp; Then went to the new River Rock casino with Mon, where we played 5 cent slots for 2 hours.&nbsp; Fun stuff!&nbsp; Initially, Mon put in $5 and cashed out&nbsp;$45.&nbsp; Then I put in $45 and lost :(&nbsp;&nbsp;HOWEVER, my dear Moni gave me $5 to try to win back my money... and I won $111!&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mon&nbsp;was down $5&nbsp;when we left... and I lost another $10 but I still walked out with $45 :)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Gambling is FUN!&nbsp;&nbsp;Mon and I are HOOKED!&nbsp; We were so&nbsp;giddy when we left the casino because I had won a&nbsp;decent amount of money (in our opinions).&nbsp; We plan to go to the casino more often :)&nbsp; Mon made this $5 rule, where we will only bet $5 and play until either we win an acceptable amount of cash, or until we lose the $5.&nbsp; One day I think I'll try my hand at Blackjack... and maybe Poker.... :)&nbsp; Better chances for bigger winnings.... and losings.

       If you haven't yet tried Manzo's, I highly recommend it!  My friends and I have been eating there for the past year and it is just incredibly yummy!  It is located in Richmond, on Alexander road across from Monogolie Grill and Cap's Bicycle.  They specialize in Japanese robata (i.e. skewers).  Our "usual" orders include:     Pork meatballs   Tsukune (chicken)   Sukiyaki (beef hotpot with a sukiyaki broth)   Ebi Gyoza   Takoyaki   Sashimi Pizza    All robata comes with 3 skewers, I think.  It is usually very packed in there, even on the weekdays, so best to either go during non-peak hours or else make a reservation!  Luckily last night it wasn't as busy and we managed to get a table right away... but that's rare.  Check it out!  It's worth your while!

       I am going to Hart House next Friday, July 23 and in anticipation, I have started selecting what dishes to order.    urlLink http://www.harthouserestaurant.com/menu.html    Usually when I go to fine dining restaurants, I order the SAME dishes all the time: Seabass, Bouillebasse, Smoked Black Cod, Sablefish, Rack of Lamb, Fresh Raw Oysters, Kettle of Clams/Mussels. I am going to *try* to expand my menu selections, and order new items. Of course, I may just fall back into my routine and order my same old dishes... depends how adventurous I am feeling that night. :) The items denoted with an asterisk (*) are my most probable choices:    Appetizer choices:   Green Curry Mussels  Cauliflower and Leek Soup  Rockshrimp and Shiitake Mushroom Springroll (*)  Dungeness Crab and Avocado Salad  Warm Tiger Prawn Salad    Entree choices:   Pan Roasted Ostrich  Rack of Australian Lamb  Asian Marinated Duck Breast  Seared East Coast Scallops  Seared Halibut (*)  Papardelle with Braised Veal Cheek    Dessert choices:   White Chocolate Panna Cotta (*)  Passionfruit Cheesecake   I'll let you know which items I decide on... My decision is reliant on what everyone else is ordering too :)

       A bit BBQ-ed out from having it 3 meals in a row :P  Friday, had Pho for dinner with Aud and Bri before we went grocery shopping for our camping trip.  Then, went to Urban Well for a couple drinks.  There's no more dance floor!  Apparently they got in trouble or something because they only have a liquor license and not a club license so dancing is prohibited.  Had a little run-in with the 5-0 and now I am traumatized and have resigned as the weekend party driver.  Moral of the story:  don't do illegal U-turns even though there are no cars around (and especially after a drink or two) because the 5-0 is watching!  Saturday, woke up early and went to Deer Lake (near Harrison) to go camping.  Made a couple pit stops on the way there to buy breakfast, go to the library, buy cherries/blueberries/corn on the side of the highway.  We were fortunate enough to have decent weather during the day, and fired up the grill, went hiking for a bit, and explored around town.  Tried the new "Mango Malibu" - it is soooooo good!  Even with half Malibu, half juice, the concoction was surprisingly (or expectedly - it was only 22% alc./vol) tasty!  Also had some Soju.  When we went to bed, it started to POUR.  All in all, it was an alright time, despite some misfortunes (Bri got a flat tire, the raccoons got at our garbage, it rained and rained all night).  Would have been better if my shoes didn't get wet (and dirty) overnight and if I wasn't dying to hop in the shower and get clean.  Thankfully Aud lent me a futon mattress so that I didn't have to sleep on the ground because everyone who slept on the ground was freezing cold all night long while I was sweating and removing layers of clothing.  Learned some little known facts about my friends (Gill is an honorary boyscout who is pro at making campfires).  Enjoyed some sausage with my fellow smokie-connoisseur, Aud.  :)  Sunday, slept in and slept on the way back and then ate the rest of our food at Aud's house.  Went home and slept some more.  (My lack of sleep over the past month has finally caught up to me).  Went out for ramen at Kintaro with the married folk for the 6th meal in a row.  Delicious!  I just had the regular Miso Ramen, and Aud had the Cold Ramen which is only served in the summer.  Highly recommend it!  You can choose your soup base (fatty/medium/lean) and your BBQ pork (fat/lean) and can add in extra ingrediants (bamboo shoots/seaweed/egg/bean sprouts).  I have been searching for a new ramen joint to go to ever since Ota-Ya changed management, and I think I have found one!  Went out for dessert at Sweet Obssession.  Delicious again!  I have been longing to try it out (after recommending several other friends to try it) and I finally have!  We split the Roasted Coconut Chiffon cake, Warm Toffee cake with Vanilla ice cream, and the Hedgehog cake.  I have heard many good things about the Warm Toffee cake and they are all true!  Exactly how I expected it to taste!  :)  If you ever tried it at Glowbal, it tastes the same!  Unfortunately, Glowbal no longer serves it :(  The Coconut Chiffon cake was awesome too!  Very sweet, but light and fluffy.  The Hedgehog cake was good, but paled in comparison to the other 2 cakes!    If anyone wants to check out Kintaro or Sweet Obssessions, let me know!  I'm in!

        Victoria Secret was having their semi-annual sale when I was down there and they had their fragances/moisturizers for 7 for $30.  I used to wear Pear Glace, Whispering Mist, and Love Spell.  To my chagrin, they decided to discontinue my favourite scent, Whispering Mist.  Last weekend, I bought Endless Love and Secret Crush.  When I put on Endless Love today, I realized that it smelled exactly like Whispering Mist!    I think I want to go back and stock up on more Endless Love before they discontinue it and while the sale is still on...  Anyone up for the States?

        Eventful and unrestful.  Shopped out and popcorned out.  Sick of driving.  Skin misses the sun.  :(  Shoe collection expanded by 3.  Liver was happy and well rested.  :)    Friday, went to Oakridge to pick up my ring and bought a couple items before I made it to the jewellery store.  At night, just chilled.  Went to Mon's and watched Barbershop 2.  It wasn't very entertaining.  We still don't really get what it was about and I guess it didn't help that there was a scratch on the DVD in the middle of the movie so we skipped a scene.    Saturday, drove down to Lynnwood (Alderwood mall) with Jan to do even more shopping.  Not sure what's up with the American drivers, but the ones I encountered drive like old women on the I5!  Privately road raged the idiots who drove slow in the left lane ("Move to the right, FAWKER!").  Made it there in exactly 1.5 hours.  Spent 2 hours in Forever 21.  If you have never been to the store, you won't understand why or how we spent so long until you've seen it:  it is HUGE and chaotic!  Tons of clothes to sift thru and you have to line up for a changing room and to pay (if you go on a weekday it's less busy, supposedly).  Was planning on buying another pair of Shox since they are cheaper down there but there weren't any styles I really liked to I bought another pair of (pink) sandals.  When we were in A&F, we bumped into Audrey and Brian!  When we got back into Richmond, I went straight to Tre's and we went to watch Spiderman 2.  It was entertaining, albeit chessy, but what do you expect.  I thought that all those bloodcurling screams were unnecessary, and that realistically, the train should have tipped over and fallen off the track due to the swarms of passengers in the dangling train car.  Gill (aka Mr.Philosophical) had an interesting perspective on the movie; he talked about how there were many antagonists, i.e. man vs. self, vs. MJ, vs. Harry.  Wow, someone has been paying attention in English class.  I went with 4 other girls and between the 5 of us, we polished off 2 tubs of popcorn (loaded with butter and popcorn seasoning) and now we have sworn off popcorn forever (yeah right, I bet it'll last a week).  The movie got out around 12:30am and I rushed home to change and go out to Balthazars for Gill's bday.  By the time I got there, everyone was drunk so I played mother hen and wrestled with Gill to confiscate his car keys;  I took one for the team and fought my way into his pockets to fish out his keys.  I was so bagged when I was driving back and fell asleep right when I got home.  Sunday, worked all fricken day.  :(  noon - 9pm.  Most of the day was spent working on this hugeass 7-paged cheque that I started last weekend.  All cheques had to be done for month end (June 30).  *sigh*  Long long day.  I was barely home and I'm falling behind in my chores... my room is a disater zone.  Hopefully next weekend I'll be able to catch up on my zzz's.  I haven't slept in since probaby 2 or 3 weekends ago.  Perhaps even more.

        Well, I am sitting here at work, probably one of the only suckers that didn't ask for a day off. :(  On the bright side, my commute to Lions Gate Hospital which usually takes me close to an hour, only took me 30 minutes today, and this is without excessive speeding and changing lanes (I was too sleepy to drive normally - in other words, aggresively).  Canada Day was spent primarily lounging at the beach trying to shake off a hangover from the night before.  Mon and I went to the Salmon Festival and walked around for a bit, but quickly realized that we were too hungover and decided to go to the beach and sleep.  For dinner, I went out with Jeremy and Ali to Dockside Cafe.  Before dinner, we stopped off at Ali's to check out his (illegal) pocket bike.  Not sure if y'all have seen/heard anything about them, but essentially it is hybrid between a bicycle and a motorcyle.  He bought it when he was in LA and flew it back here with him.  It is this tiny thing that only weighs around 95lbs and goes around 60kph.  Apparently it is for kids aged 16 and up and hence does not require a license or insurance to ride.  Not sure why it is illegal in Canada, but hopefully the laws change.  Ali is going to try to swing a deal with the manufacturers again and get Jer and I each one for around $299US (normally they sell for around $500US, I think).  If you see a chick cruisin' the city streets on a tiny motorcycle, it's most likely me so please refrain from honking at me for going too slow.  :)  Please don't run me over...  Dockside Cafe was alright, but they had a special set menu for Canada Day.  Ali kept raving about the squid there so I was mildly disappointed to find that it was not on their menu for the night.  One day I will have to go back and try it...  I had a burger to alleviate my ongoing BBQ craving and it really hit the spot.  :)  Afterwards, we went to Performance Works and listened to some Jazz.  The style of the group that was performing, Andy Milne & Dapp Theory, is described as "jazz fused with hip hop and Bartok".  Not your conventional jazz performance, but it was entertaining nonetheless.  They had a "poetic percussionist" who rapped briefly in each song.  It reminded me of US3, the group that did "Cantaloop": jazz fused with rap.  The pianist was outstanding, as was the saxophonist.    Next stop:  O'Douls for Jennifer Scott?

       You get what you pay for...  Last night, I began assembling my closet (with Dad's help to lift the heavy boards) in my sauna-of-a-room. Man oh man, was I going to pass out from the heat. The heat gradually made me more and more irritable (as it did to Dad) and eventually lead to frustration by the end of the night when it came time to attach the 2 [heavy] mirrored doors to the armoir.  I have engaged in numberous Ikea projects to date, and have never had any problems until now; I blame my troubles on the sheer size of the furniture. Here's my beef with my latest Ikea experience:   The instructions were wrong! I bought the 100w x 60d x 201h closet and the instructions only had steps for the 50w x 60d x 201h closet and for combining 2 50w x 60d x 201h closets together. I had to figure out part of it myself...  It was missing 2 screws! Thankfully those were non-essential parts and my closet is perfectly functioning without them.  The frame is wobbly, despite screwing everything as tight as can be and following the instructions to a T.  The doors are annoying to attach! You have to align it precisely, which is near impossible to control due to the weight and size of the doors. If you don't attach the doors perfectly, they won't close properly.   The doors are a tad too heavy for the frame! When you open both doors fully, the closet tips forward due to the weight imbalance.  There is no magnet to ensure that the doors don't fly open.   If I really think about it though, the closet wasn't THAT cheap... and when you factor in all the costs of labour, frustrations, and damaged father-daughter relationship (just kidding), it probably costs more than buying a pre-assembled one!  Now, the next step is to figure out the optimal clothing-organization plan so that I can fit ALL my clothes in my 2.5 closets (I took over half of my brother's spare room closet)...

       It's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hot in my room.  It is comparable to a sauna.  For the past couple days, I have been bit by bit preparing my room for my new closet (that is currently sitting in the hallway boxed up).  I intend to put my new closet where my bookcase currently resides, and moving my bookcase to the empty area by my desk which is presently occupied by various crap:  a large tupperware storage container full of my old school stuff, and what seems to be hundreds of empty shopping bags ("evidence", as Mon puts it).  Yesterday I began by clearing the area by my desk that I want to move my bookcase to.  Today, I single-handedly moved (and repaired) my full-sized bookcase to its planned destination.  I swear, I must have sweat out all 2L of water I drank at work today, because I felt like I was going to collapse from being overheated!  I would have waited for cooler weather, but my room is in such a disarray that it has been really bothering me.  Tomorrow, I plan on assembling my closet (with the help of a brother).  I can't wait until my room (and all of my clothes) are finally organized!  I have been waiting for this moment for 2-3 years....

       Time sure flies... seems like just yesterday that I wrote last week's update!  Before we know it, summer will be over :(  And then we will have to endure 8 long months of bitter cold sundress-less weather... oh what a crime it is.  Friday, went out on a "date" with Jan, just like the ol' days when it was just the 2 of us, wining and dining, drinking and dancing.  We reminised about the ol' days of people watching and noticed that ever since we started partying with the rest of our girls, we have been having more and more drunken memories.  We hit up Glowbal for dinner (our usual dinner venue from back in the day) and Opus and Crush for drinks (our usual lounging venue from back in the day).  We shared the appetizer platter, which was very yummy.  It came with a crab cake (super tasty), tuna tartare, and mushroom risotto.  For entrees, we both opted for the dungeoness crab crusted seabass, which was done really well, not overcooked and soft and flaky.  For dessert, we shared the chocolate platter, which came with white chocolate creme brulee, tiramisu, truffles, chocolate gelato, and chocolate pate.  The only thing that I really liked was the pate; the rest was just so-so.  The crowd at Crush was disappointingly unstylish and ruined our plans for people watching, our usual bartender (who used to give us free drinks) was no longer working there, even the cute doorman who used to always let us in was missing!  The only "familiar" aspect remaining was the fact that we ran into friends that also used to be regulars at Crush.  Saturday, went out for obligatory lunch with my family, since my eldest brother was back in town for 2 weeks to attend 2 weddings.  Went for dim sum, where we sat around chatting for an hour after we finished eating (such an untypical thing for my family to do... we NEVER usually bond!)  Dragged my dad out to Ikea after lunch to help me buy a waredrobe closet (I have been in desperate need of an additional closet for over 2 years... mine is full and I already filled up half of my brother's 2nd closet and I still need more room!)  This one piece of the closet was hella heavy and I ended up cursing numerous times while lifting it off the buggy and into the vehicle.  Went out for dinner at Also with some girlfriends.  Everytime I go there, I have the Bitchin' Peach martini... it is really good :)  Too bad I couldn't say the same about my entree; I had the Kimchi Chicken and I got chickened out after 5 pieces - not enough kimchi!  And the noodles were so greasy.  Afterwards, we dropped by Wet for a birthday, then hit up the casino where Cel taught Cor and I how to play roulette.  Cor and Cel were lucky and kept winning, but I kept losing.  I should have stopped earlier but got drawn into the wraths of gambling, once again.  *sigh*  Sunday, went out for lunch with Cor and Mon.  Then went to the mall to search for a last minute card for my cousin's bridal shower.  The shower dinner was at Papi's in Steveston.  It was so dark in there that I started nodding off.  But the food was good!  There was a limited menu for the party, and I opted for the house salad, prawns and scallop swekers with herb risotto, and lemon mascarpone cheesecake.  Not only was I consistently the first one to finish my food, but my plates were always spotless.  I felt like such a pig.  :8(  Part of the reason I ate so fast is because I wasn't talking to anyone.  I was sitting beside my mom and across from my aunt; there was no one in my age group there so I was extremely bored, to the point of nodding off!   No beach time, once again :(  I think I need to find more beach buddies!  Anyone in?

            Ahhh long weekend :)  Friday, got off work early to drop by Cor's last minute surprise birthday cake gathering, organized by Cami. Ate a LARGE slice of ice cream cake (it must have been 1/8th of the cake) at Cami's urging. Went out for dinner with Andrew and Pat at Chen's Shanghai Restaurant to satiate my craving for chinese food. The siu long bau was yummy, as usual. Too bad I couldn't say the same about the deep fried duck! Had gelato afterwards at Amato Gelato (Coconut and Amaretto... yummy). Just relaxed at home for the rest of the night and rested up for the long awaited clubbing night with the girls and Cor's boyfriend and co.  Saturday, went out for Dim Sum with Cor at Neptune. Went to Lansdowne and Richmond Centre for a bit where I ended up buying a new diamond pendant (sloooowly replacing all my jewellery) because the salesgirl gave me a discount (such a sucker for good deals). Went to Plaza for some druken fun.  Sunday, went out for lunch with Tre and Mon at Kingspark, for some "Cha Tan Tang" (sp?). Went to Costco, where we all started dragging our feet due to massive hangovers. Then went to Oakridge where we did a little bit of damage. Went to Jeff's bbq where I was crowned the smokie-eating champ for eating 4 cheddar smokies (I felt so gross afterwards). Then went to Cor's where we attempted to watch The Big Bounce but turned it off halfway through because we all were falling asleep from boredom.  Monday, worked :( Then went to Spanish Banks to chill with some old friends. Then we hit up Earl's for margs for the rest of the night.  No beach time :( Relaxing weekend though.
