      Spent the day interviewing possible roommates.  I can't help but feel as if a good portion of my day was a complete waste, but there are a few hopefuls.  One girl came and didn't even look at the room.  She didn't like the neighborhood.  Go figure.  One woman came and we found out she was allergic to cats.  We did post that this is a "cat owned" household in our ad.  Why waste time?  Seems silly to me. We got a woman who worked in selling newspaper personal ads.  A guy who was a photographer, gallery worker.  (I'm a little intimidated by him, he has an MFA in photography, errrrr.)  Tomorrow we will interview a political activist, someone my roommate knows through someone.  I'm hopeful for him, he sounds pretty cool.  Wish me luck.  We have a week to fill the space.  In happier news, between interviewees, I had the time to tune up my bicycle.  I've had this bike since last November and haven't ridden it yet.  I took it out today, first for a spin around the neighborhood, just to make sure everything was working right, then to my friend Onika's.  She lives near Prospect Park, and it's about a half hour ride.  Never can do anything half way, can I?  I rode back too, and took a longer path so I could ride through the park near my neighborhood.  It was quite nice.  Unfortunately, since it's been at least five years, if not more, since I've ridden a bike frequently, my bum is pretty damn sore.  Legs too.  It was so nice though, to feel the wind in my hair, and to actively participate in my commute.  I could really use the exercise too.  After riding about three blocks, I was huffing and puffing, but it got easier as I continued on.  So, goodbye NYC transit, hello pot holes!!!  At least riding my bike is free.  But not without sacrifice.  I arrived at Onika's sweaty and smelly.  I'll remember to bring a change of clothes next time I bike to a social gathering.  ha ha ha.

      I decided I wanted to write this stuff down, finally.  I've been thinking about "the revolution".  That can be very vague, and in writing, I hope to solidify my thoughts some, and make myself clear.  As this is a very large topic, and one which requires some research, I will be doing this in parts.  Today, I'm focusing on "what is it? a definition of the revolution" and "why?"  It is not a political revolution, but an evolution of thought, a chance to let integrity rule, and a hope that humanity will learn to act with precision of intent and clarity of action.  The evolution must be one in which greed, selfishness, and ego are transcended.  I hope that one day, humanity will consider what is best for everyone, not just that which benefits the singular entity.  I'm not talking about communism, socialism, or any other socio-political system.  I'm talking about everyday life, as little things grow.  Any revolution/evolution in society has to start with the individual, I'm hoping I'm not alone.  The evolution is where open-mindedness flourishes and taboos are forgotten. Where we have faith in what is before us, instead of an ideal that cannot be duplicated, and the clarity of mind to understand the difference between what is before us and what we are simply "seeing".  (That's right, Amanda, just keep reading Hegel. lol)  Before a revolution can truly begin, there needs to be enough individuals with common purpose.  Slowly, one by one, more and more people understand.  It seems, and maybe I'm being optimistic, that once someone has the "click of understanding", their personal evolution has begun.  There is no going back, now.  This is a call to arms, but not in the physical sense.  This is a revolution where our weapons are concise intention, words, thought, a willingness to teach and understand, artistic expression, open hearts and open ears.  It is a desire to grow, indivually and collectively, through widom, intelligence and open discussion.  I am building an army of artists, philosophers, writers, musicians . . . housewives, lawyers, used car salesmen, and telephone operators.  But the question now, is why?  Best to put it in a list.  I do not feel as if these need explanation. 1.  billions of people living in abject poverty, humiliation, and starvation, plagued by disease and oppression 2.  war and pollution 3.  overwhelming increase in medical depression and mental instability in the middle classes 4.  departure of society from nature and cyclical living at an ever increasing rate 5.  increasing separation of economic classes  I know I'm not alone in understanding that these issues need addressing.

      So this is Monday.  La la lovely weekend is over, and I'm finding myself with a hectic schedule. *sigh*  Working at night at the photo lab, and (hopefully) days at the cafe I interviewed at.  I just got home from the lab after one day, and already I'm tense and about to bust out of my skin.  I consider this a reminder of why I left there in the first place, but money's money, and it's only for the week. Already scheduling shooting on Saturday.  Looks like I won't have a day off till Sunday, and that is already booked with apartment renovation.  It's not such a horrible thing.  At least I'm not terrifically bored, and I have found that having too much time on my hands tends to make me a little nutty . On a happier note, I'm proving once again that's there's always a bright side to everything.  Though I have been frustrated about my recently ex'd roommate owing us a good deal of money, when she moved her stuff out, she left three large bags of clothes behind.  So thus, cup of coffee in hand, clad in pj's and accompanied by the lovely boyfriend, I went shopping in my living room this morning.  I have a whole new wardrobe now, and the timing couldn't be better.  Laundry day is fast approaching in a very urgent style.  And it's funny, because every time I asked her if I could borrow something of hers, she would hand me something way too big.  Strangely, everything she left behind fits me perfectly.  Curious.    I spent most of my day printing weddings and family portraits, so I haven't anything terribly interesting to yap about.  Except one thing. . . . I printed a very formal birthday party.  It was for a little girl.  The strange thing is that they were celebrating her 1 1/2 birthday.  In beaded gowns and tiaras.  Maybe I just live life very simply, but it came off as rather extravagant.

      I really love birthdays, yet I'm not terribly fond of hangovers.  This one isn't too bad, and I'm recovering quickly, but it's here nonetheless.  Thank you, dear friend, black coffee. It was an interesting night.  I met a handful of new people, which is always a pleasure.  Saw a couple people I already knew too, and that was definitely a pleasure.  Smoked cigarettes in the rain, holding an umbrella on the rooftop.  Managed to question, yet again, my unfailing blind faith in love.  That is one of those things that probably takes up way too much of my head space.  I wonder often if it's better to love unselfishly or to question why I love as I do.  Is the one I'm loving worthy of this huge expanse of emotion, having no end.  Is my love too much, where it should be restricted?  Is there such a possibility of restricting my love, and if so, would that not be a killer to love itself?  And thus, isn't the self-restriction of love living within fear, and forcing love to become about myself, when it ought to be about love?  Is it not better to jump into the deep end and swim freely, than to wade in the shallow end, fearful of drowning?  These things require pondering, but I suppose are better left to being answered by time and experience.  On another note, I rode home on an empty subway car, as it was quite late.  My digital camera doesn't pick up nuances in reflected light as well as I'd like it to, so I did not photograph what I saw, but may make it a point to ride with my A-1 to capture this.  I was on one of the older cars, with the orange seats.  Each and every seat was reflecting light in a different way.  An hourglass shape here, and a butterfly shape there, some amorphous shapes, and others simply circles.  I find these simple things very enjoyable, as they are always there, it is simply a matter of seeing them, having the still space in which to want to.  I got to watch the water beaded windows speed pass graffiti underground, and look through layers of plexiglass at tiled walls, my favorite being the Lexington Ave station, N train.  There is something very beautiful about being on an above ground train (which I was for part of it) and seeing the lights of NYC distorted through water beads.  Really very beautiful, and I'm not sure why, but I will ponder this, and hopefully come up with an answer in due time.

      I've been thinking of doing this blog thing for a while.  I'm not really very good at calling people, so I figure if anyone wants to know what I'm up to, they can just check out my blog.  I guess it's sort of a cop-out, but so many times I've decided to get better about being in touch, and failed again and again.  So thus . . . .  I'm Amanda.  I'm a photographer.  Here's the url to my website:  http://www.amaphoto.com  I live in Brooklyn, and I love it.  I'm an artist, in every sense of the word, or at least I try to be.  I try to make every action, thought and moment have value and integrity.  Sometimes, I fail.  Sometimes, I succeed.  And sometimes, I flounder about in the middle ground.  You'll hear more about the trials and tribulations of this particular life-long experiment in future blogs.  What I'm up to:  I photograph bands.  I don't usually get paid.  I'd like to.  For now, however, my main interest is in documenting live music performance in NYC.  With each photograph I take, each show I go to, every song that is written, changes occur in the though processes of community.  I am watching a revolution unfold, and I believe I will have a story or two to be told before I go.  I am currently working on curating my first art show.  It should be pretty good.  It has begun to frustrate me, but I will carry on anyway.  I am looking for a job.  I want to serve coffee to people.  It is my aim to have myself in a space where communication with strangers is viable.  I also want to caffienate the world.  So that's me in a nutshell, for now.  There is, of course, more to it.  Stay tuned . . . .
