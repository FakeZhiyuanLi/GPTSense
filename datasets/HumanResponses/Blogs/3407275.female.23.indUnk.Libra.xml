      I always get the overwhelming feeling of escaping.  And whenever the urge comes for me to leave the city, I get up and go climb a mountain, take a road trip, or just get away for the weekend.  Else, I get restless and irritable, as if I was being suffocated and I’m gasping for air, scratching to get out.  Sometimes, the urge is so strong that I get crazy and drop everything.  I just up and leave my responsibilities, without any pre-planning.  I call these  gung-ho hits .  Pretty much the same way I make my everyday decisions.  It’s harder now that I have work.  Back in college, you miss a class you make up for it by studying what you missed and just getting your notes straightened out,  if you even take notes .  When you’re blessed with a good mind, then you actually have less of a hassle than most people who cut class with you, you just breeze through the class and you’re set.  I was able to feed my longing to leave the noise, pollution and stress the city instigates in me almost every week.  Back then, climbing and backpacking was part of my life.  Sometimes more prioritized than school.  Then I became a bum for a while and my urge became pretty content with my freedom to go anywhere at anytime I please.  Sometimes I think that hunger to escape lay dormant during those days.  Eventually, my slacking off caught up with me and I was forced to work. Not only did that limit my time to feed my urges, it left me stuck to see the heart of the city everyday, too.  More than ever, your heart aches to get out.  You wonder how some people can stand it.  I could never really tolerate it as well as others did.  More often than not, I find myself wondering how people are able to stand it.  I guess in many ways I’m just a  modern nomad .  I find it difficult to stay in one place too long.   Forever in need of change and finding peace in changing environments .  There are very seldom of us around nowadays.  When the rawness of land dies as it is replaced by the development of a city, the nomadic spirit of the people surrounding that land dies with it.  It’s a shame how present-day development takes away the very core of man’s soul.  It rids us of the idea that it actually takes very little for us to live.  So many unnecessary comforts have sprung to our attention that we find ourselves needing them in our everyday lives.  I love going out to the wilderness and get myself back to the basic necessities of life.  Many ask me what the whole point is to my subjecting myself to discomfort.  It makes me think how I never saw it as discomfort at all.  If anything, I consider it comforting that I can still realize and recognize the rawness of life.  I can still generate that zest for living and enjoy life with the simplest things in this world.   Balu  said it, or sang it rather, best in The  Jungle Book  as he taught  Mowgli  how to “look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities (and to) forget about your worries and your strife…”     Mountain ranges in Northern Luzon  Like I said,  the more basic it is, the more alive it makes you feel .  You realize and experience life in its simplest form.  Not many people can appreciate that.  If you backpack a lot, you feel this because it is instilled in your nature to forget all the luxuries this world has to offer.  You literally  live off your backpack , living on barter, bargain, free-loading and scavenging.  It always amazes me how a small amount of money can get me so far when I rough it, compared to when I spend that same amount on the luxury of riding a plane, a cab, or prepaid reservations at a nice hotel somewhere.  Not only will going out gung-ho get you more audacious encounters, it tests your survival skills and takes your adventurous spirit to its limits.  You always gain more when you embark on such, as city-pampered people would say it, “crazy” endeavors.     My quickest escape: Puerto Gallera  A man who was lost in the wild named  Chris McCandless  once said in a letter to a friend, “…but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future.”  I believe this statement with the same passion as this great man who said it did.  He died young, but lived a full life.  When I am old and gray, I would rather sit in a wicker chair on the porch of a modest house with great stories to tell my grandchildren, than sit in my yacht, have more money than I can count, and realize I have led a boring life.      chris mccandless a.k.a   alex supertramp   So when was the last time you’ve roughed it and actually left the suffocating premises of the city?

      I was set to leave on Wednesday to go away for 5 days--my last hurrah before I finally start  work .  Work is something I dread because its the easiest way to feel the  everydayness of life .  So before I start my drone-like days in Ortigas, I wanted to reset my system and escape somewhere far,far away...However, things started to go against me : the sudden weather change (I don't think the rainy season ever started this early!), lack of orders, realizing the fact that i have been to this "escape" 6 or 7 times, and finally, my really good friend who i was counting on going flaked on me...  Normally, I would've raised the roof and gone ballistic.  But oddly, when the really late bad news hit me today, I was oddly ok about it.  I was seriously  not  in  denial  about my feelings, I was  really  ok with the bad news.  So I go about my day.  Slowly, the bad news of my not leaving sinks in as it spreads across the Shire while people began to inquire why I cancelled my trip.  They are as shocked as I am that I'm not pissed about the situation...  Then I started thinking...why am I not pissed?  My friend  Dre  (who, God knows, I've given a hard time about flaking more than anyone I know) says its probably because I've matured.  What does that mean?  I would say that flaking is in my top ten list of "hatest things in the world" but after today I may need to rethink that list.  Aside from wondering if my friends spiked my drink with prozac last night, I can't think of any reason why I am fine with this particular flaking incident.  Maybe  I have grown up  and my capacity to take in bad news just grew, too.  So I'll place my reaction to today's bad news as disappointed--for the lack of a better word.  Although I should feel bad about my disappointment, I feel weirder that I don't...and I'm more puzzled about  that  than feeling bad about wrecked plans.  And now its got me thinking, what else has changed?  What else will change?  I kind of like the fact that I've changed my outlook regarding my negative traits, but what if this "maturity" they call changes things I like about my old self?  I love doing stupid useless things, like texting a friend even when they're right next to me.  But what if I'm forty and I look back and actually feel that to do that is stupid?  I'd honestly feel bad about it...  So what do I do now? Frankly, I don't know.  I'm still stuck in the city and have 5 more days of bum life to waste before starting work!  I still want to escape to somewhere...but since chances of that happening are dramatically dim, I guess I'm left with hoping that  Peter Pan    loses his shadow in my room tonight so that he can wisk me away to  Neverneverland . That way I get my escape and I never have to grow up and deal with "maturity."  I hit two birds with one stone.    can anyone tell me how to get here?

      It's funny how whenever I walk into a room full of strangers I ALWAYS EXPECT that they'll all instantly hate me.  And usually they do.  But then, there are always those few who dare to stick it out to try to get to know me, and they see the pages behind the cover and realize I'm an amazing person.  The few people that really know me well can gaurantee not only my loyalty and good friendship, but that I "manufacture fun."  I know my best guy friend  Dre  will kill me for saying this because he believes that we BOTH manufacture fun, but that's not my point.  My point is that  I am fun .  I don't understand why most people get a misconception that I'm intimidating just because I'm different.     how can you be intimidated by this face?   That's why for those who have taken a chance to look beyond the cover of my book, I cherish their friendship a lot.  Because even though I can count them with one hand, I have no doubt in my mind that they love me for who I am  period .  So in return, not only do they have my complete devotion, they also get a taste of the unique maximum fun I maufacture!     Dre (my partner in crime) and i posing with our twin devious grins      *I have it all figured out dre, you and I are both maximum fun creators.  So when we're together, it becomes a whole chaos.*

      Today I blew up at a friend who I felt has been abusive and demanding towards me recently.  Maybe it’s miscommunication like she says.  Maybe it’s a big misunderstanding.  It could be she's completely right and I'm completely wrong.  Or it could also be the other way around.  In the end, what really matters is  you say how you feel  towards a friend even when sometimes it may hurt him or her.  Believe me, it beats bitching about it to someone else and later on not doing anything about what you have just bitched about anyway.  Number one, you destroy friendships by destroying reputations that way.  Number two, you don’t solve anything.  By being honest, you avoid both.  I love the people I have decided to invest in.  Sometimes that love gets tough when things get rough.  I do not sugar coat it for you when I have a problem with you because that’s not what real friends are supposed to do.  You say the truth and you say how you feel, even if it hurts sometimes, because that’s what good friendships are.  In light of this, I decided to write about my favorite people and why I love them.   CAT      sleeping beauty Cat in caliraya   My best friend who I love and keep close to heart…my pseudo-lover, she has been there for me through good times and bad.  She never fails to make me laugh with her uncanny ability to be goofy (yes, my perfect goddess of a friend is goofy, too!) EG. slamming headfirst into  her own kitchen door !  She has her own dose of tough love.  Will never sugar coat it for me when I really need the cold hard truth.   DREPPY      Dre trying to be buff and goofy at the same time   Dre + Pam = Maximum Fun.  Enough said.  No one has ever come close to being as equally good a friend to me as I am to him.  My friendship with Dre is timeless and priceless.   HERBO      I was going to put a much worse picture, but I'm kind enough to just indulge you with this one   You learn and unlearn things in life all the time.  Learning and unlearning things with Herbo is the best.  I haven’t enjoyed it as immensely with anyone else more than I have with him.  Chemistry is not one of my favorite things, but it seems to work well with us.   TOBOR      Look at that face.  How can you not love that face?     Pam   (in a shaky, almost breaking into to tears voice over the phone) :   “Mon…”    Mon   :  “Sige, punta na ko dyan.”   Ten minutes later, he arrives at my house in the same clothes he’d slept in to make sure I was ok.  Can’t beat that.  I owe Mon a good chunk of my sanity.  Ironic how it often seems like he’s lost his own.  Hehe.   LIAN      a worm's eyeview of lian   Lian is a rare person, I don't think I've met anyone else quite like her.  Her quiet ways and her chaotic personality is a contradiction in itself.  But she is precious nontheless.  I only look up to a rare few.  I definitely look up to her.  Lian is never afraid to make a face when her photo is being taken.  She is one of the most photogenic people I know.   JAZZ      A bird's eye view of Jazz (her favorite camera angle)   The beach and Jazz are one.  Most of my greatest beach trips are with her.  No one can be a greater groupie.   “She knows the lyrics to all the songs, even the bad ones…especially the bad ones.”    JOHANN      Johann in that Sagada trip where a ghost scared the living shit out of us   Without any sleep for twenty four hours, he takes a bus straight from work to go to Puerto Gallera because of a promise he made to be there when he said he would.  Drunk, dazed and just about to puke, he stands up and says,  “Pam, I love you.  You’re my big sistah!”   Jo, the one liner steady-eddy I can’t seem to hate even when he bums too much cigarettes that I actually buy an extra pack for him to bum from.   DANA      Dana making a funny face   She's like Guns N Roses in the sense that you don't really listen to them as much as you used to, but they were there when you needed them.  Dana and I rarely saw each other after highschool, but she made that time in my life a blast!  I'll never forget our petty bestfriend fights.  Especially the biggest one in  St. James  where it was a full-blown cat fight and we had spectators betting on who's gonna win.  "Ako tataya ako sa mapayat!"  "Ah ako dyan ako sa mataba!"   Dana is probably one of the most generous and beautiful-souled people I know.   ITOS      Is that receding hairline I see?   My old fart of a friend.  He watches out for me all the time, always making sure I'm in check,  “Are you being Pamthetic again?”   My savior from first-job hell.  He never fails to lend a numb ear ( a  numb ear  is an ear that is tired of listening to you blab about the same things over and over that it ends up not listening anymore but has an automatic “uh-huh” after every 3 or 4 sentences )  Itos never fails to keep it real.  And never fails to tell me when it's snowing :)   KEN      Ken sleeping the  entire time  during my birthday in Caliraya   I just love Ken because no one can dance like Jesus Quintana like he does.  That and his ability to compose a hilarious song on the spot.

      For as long as I can remember I have had more guy friends than girls.  What can I do?  I have always been  one of the guys .  Heck, I’ve actually been dubbed  Romy Boy  by my guy friends.  But the day I was dubbed the name to the day I actually lived up to it (by ridding of my only girl trait: long hair) was one of my most liberating experiences and a big turning point in my life.  Turns out, after playing the part of Romy Boy, I found the real Pam underneath when I learned to be, well, more of a girl and less of a Romy. Hehe.     Romy Boy Romualdez   It all began when one hot summer evening, a bunch of my friends and I was bored out of our minds hanging out in  Paolo Aranza’s  porch.  There was nothing to do.  We were all bums trying to tolerate  Marvin’s  excessive yapping on a new interesting thing he had just discovered.  Paolo and Marvin start a heated conversation about which video game is better…I see my friend  Amanda  roll her eyes from a distance.  Then, out of boredom, she blurts out  “Let’s shave Pam’s head.”   Her boyfriend,  John Joe  adds,  “I have clippers at home!”   Marvin gets excited.  I force Pao to go.  I tell Amanda I’m not going to shave my head unless Pao (who hates to leave his house) comes along.  Marvin convinces him.   I shave my head .   Voila!      at my baldest   The next day, I have breakfast with Amanda’s family.  Her dad comments,  “Didn’t you have hair last night?”     This got me thinking, I needed to break the news to my mom subtly, so I text her,  “Mom, just to warn you, I cut my hair and made a drastic change!”   Why did I shave off my hair?   I have no idea!   Mostly I would say it was because I was in dire need of change during that time in my life.  Partly I can account to my not being able to say no to a dare.  Either way, I’ve always wanted to try the Sinead O’Connor look.  I didn’t regret it.  I had a lot of fun with my bald head.   Here are some episodes of my shaved head days:      trying hard to look like a girl in sanctum (notice the make up and earrings! things i never wear!)      giving up and pretending to play the part (thanks to am for the authentic lesbian couple acting look)      me trying out the 'fro...      ...blonde...      ...a dominatrix...      trying to show everyone i'm  really a girl  by wearing bikinis more...      ...and sometimes a skirt (but obviously i can't sit in one!)      Hell, I even tried the Bene look   Then the  baboon stage  came...     ...and i tried to hide it with a beanie...      ...but got rid of it when i saught refuge in Sagada with my good friend Kat   But now I'm normal again.    Thanks to the following people: John Joe (for the clippers), Amanda (for suggesting it), Paolo (for tagging along and being the deciding factor) and Marvin (for convincing Pao, and pissing him off in the process!)                    and one crazy night at Pao's...all this would have never been possible.

      A good friend of mine came by yesterday to get his  ATC , a piece of climbing equipment I borrowed from him for my  Puerto Carrera  last December.   Nel  and I are not very close, but we have been to many mountains and trips together.  He was with me when I climbed my last mountain,  Mt. Amuyao  which was an easy four hour hike to the top but an arduous sixteen hour trek going to the town of  Batad .  It was the hardest experience I’ve had to date.  My friend,  Mon , who was leading the climb, shortened a three-day itinerary to two days!  I believe that this experience was the best and most memorable I’ve had with Nel, as well.  I dedicate this blog to him because he’s leaving for the States soon.      Nel and I in Sagada last May 2004     Why Do We Climb?   a.  The sunrise is worth all the hassle.     Mon watching the sunrise   b.  You get to see things from a different perspective (like above the clouds!)     c.  You build friendships that cannot be compared to any, since you go through an experience that you can’t have with friends in the city.  Imagine knowing your friend’s smell from day 1 to day 5.  d.  You test your will power  e.  You’re definitely fit     right after Puerto Carrera   f.	You have a sense of belonging.  Meaning, you feel like your part of an elite club that only has a few members.     My climbing buddies   g.	It is simple.  When you climb, you see how little it is you need to survive.  I like remembering this from time to time.  In the end it all boils down to my desire for simplicity.  In climbing, this is where I feel most alive since I am at my simplest state...

      After leaving  Ateneo Law School  back in 2001, my life felt like it was turned upside down.  It’s almost been two years since that whole wreck and I don’t think things have fallen in to place ever since.  I was one of those weird kids that  really  wanted to become a lawyer—for real!  For as long as I can remember, I have tried to pave the road to get there.  I was one of the few to graduate high and actually know what I wanted to do with my life.  Until of course I got on board and decided I wanted out.  So I walked the plank and jumped off with a smile.  To borrow  Ani DiFranco’s  words, “if I’m gonna go down, I’m gonna do it with style.”  Sure enough when the first trimester of sleepless massive caffeine high nights of studying were over, I was the only one to walk out of there with a smile on my face.  From then on I have been a lost little soul.  No worries.  My bestfriend  Cat  once said that we’re allowed to make wrong turns in our life.  I don’t think I have made any wrong turns in my well mapped out life until I actually swerved off the nicely paved road I made for myself and tried my chances on the beaten path.  I’ve been making all the wrong turns since then.  But I’m happy.  I know that I’m going to keep making the wrong turns until I find the right ones and I’m glad that I’m doing this now, while I’m young and can afford to make such mistakes.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt more lost in my life more than the way I do now.  It feels like I’ve been hitting rock bottom constantly.  Some days I get temporarily elated because things seem to turn up, only to realize that they haven’t and it’s like I’ve hit rock bottom of rock bottom.  Then you think to yourself, “ It can’t get any worse than this, things will have to look up soon.”   They don’t.  So I’ve made myself comfortable here, in this really bad rut that I seem to be perpetually stuck in.     My bestfriend Cat and I with our best smiles   Despite all the negativity, at least in the end I know what I want:  to find a job that I will be happy in  (which is to  write  or be  doing anything creative ).  So after swearing off call centers and bank teller day jobs, I suck it up and live in poverty until my window of opportunity opens.  I know that if I sit still enough I’ll be able to grab it when the time comes.  For now, I try to get by with my life by keeping in mind that I am a writer because when I wake up in the morning it’s all I can think about doing.  That’s where it all starts anyway.   ps. I walked out of that job I was bitching about in my last blog!

      Last night I had a hard time sleeping...Aside from the fact that it was really late and I was forcing myself to sleep early because I needed to wake up at 5am, I had a bad case of the anxiety blues!  I start work the next day.  My good friend,  Ton , asked me if I was excited.  I smirked at his question.  Excited?  About work?  If there was a word to describe what I was feeling, it would be more of  dread .  However, I sit here now at the corner cubicle of my new work place as I write this and though I still don't know what awaits me (because after I was told to not be late,  my trainer is late !), I'm pretty sure things will not be as bad as the ones I thunk up in bed last night...I just realized that expecting the worst things on uncertain situations is what works best for me.  That way, I never get disappointed in the end.  I just have to figure out how to deal with the  dread of the next day coming .  So here I am now, with droopy eyes and hating myself for arriving at 6:30am (parking here in Ortigas is insane!).  Not only did dread help with my lack of sleep, but so did (a) my left knee in constant pain! (b) no warm body beside me! and (c) because I knew that when the dawn came I would be feeling the everdayness of things again...  But I'll see...  It is apparent, compared to my other writings, that today I'm just purely venting and ranting since there's nothing better to do while waiting for my  late trainer !

      I just came from the worst beach experience of my life.  Unlike many, I prefer the beach empty.  No parties, no blasting music from bars, no one from Manila I know lurking around…just me and the serenity that an empty beach offers.  An empty beach offers the same peace a mountain top can offer.   Imagine this, it’s early in the morning, the sun is just rising in the distance behind another mountain’s peak, you sip your coffee as the wind carries mist that your hair catches.  You sigh then realize,  this is why I live .  The only problem with mountains is that  (1)  you get so dead tired when you finally reach the top  (2)  you have to suffer the smell of your stinky self for at least 3 days and  (3)  on a hot day, you can’t exactly take a refreshing dip in the water because there rarely is any water source (and if there was you’d be drinking it not swimming in it!)  But the lucky free spirit that I am, I should be proud to say that I was able to experience a beautiful beach so empty that as I ran across one end to the other I only bumped into four or five other people.  That beach was  Boracay .  Impossible, you say?  Think again!  Although this place has the promise of breath-taking beauty it also has the notorious reputation of being one of the most chaotic party spots in our country.  But very early in March last year, I caught a window of emptiness and entered into a different, almost surreal world.  To top it off, I only spent  Php3,500 !   Here’s how:   A.   I didn’t plan anything .  I just set a date as to when I wanted to leave.  No pre-reservations, no plane ticket reservations (I didn’t even take the plane!), just me getting out of my house and taking a cab to the pier.  B.   I was lucky .  A good friend of my ex-boyfriend’s had a captain for a dad on one of the shipping lines and my boat ride to Boracay was free!  (Just incase you’re wondering, the fare is Php950 for air-conditioned tourist beds that comes with a pillow a mattress and sheets.  While Php700 accommodations are available for economy beds which are lovely steel double deckers—and that’s about all you get!)  C.   I am resourceful .  The boat drops you off in the middle of the ocean.  Water taxis (which are actually just bangkas) take you straight to Boracay shores.  However, to charter a bangka costs about Php800. So I introduced myself to a pack of dirty old German men amidst all the chaos (and believe me, fifty people or so trying to get off one exit door to step into the middle of nowhere is chaos!) as I proceeded to ask if they’d like to share the boat ride with me.  Sure enough they did and I ended up only spending Php60 for myself!  D.   I’m the ultimate beach bum!   I found a place in Station 3 that is right by the border of Station 2.  A beachfront resort with fan rooms that I was able to haggle to ( yes it’s true !) only Php300 a night! Since taking a shower isn't part of my beach vacation itinerary, I just basically needed a place to crash.  The room was  perfect .  E.   I always say barter is better than purchase .  I headed for  Bom Bom bar  to have a drink and brought some of my CDs.  My lucky credits were still working I guess because as I struck a conversation with the bartender,  Mike , I discovered that he was also an old backpacker.  Mike left for a one month Boracay vacation and has not come back to Manila in three years!  He likes my music and asked for a couple of my burned discs.  In return, I got free drinks during my entire stay and was even invited to dinner a couple of times as an exchange of good will among new friends.  Or simply, a barter between free spirits.  I don’t think I can ever go back to Boracay unless I’m guaranteed that it will be the same as my last visit.  The ambiance is so different.  There was no tourist vibe at all.  The only people I met that were not locally from there were other backpackers from other countries (eg. two cab drivers from London, a lone high school graduate from the States, etc).  So for those of you who wish to watch a perfect sunset while propped on your elbows on beautiful empty white sand, come with me this March… let’s pass the backdoor way to Boracay  :)    have you ever seen boracay this empty?

      I finally found the end of that long fuse I've acquired.&nbsp; That's right folks, I'm super pissed at the moment.&nbsp; I'm not mad about anything in particular, I'm just pissed off at the world in general.&nbsp; Yes, it sounds really angst-sy and childish, but I think to be pissed because your fed up is&nbsp;worst feeling of frustration one could ever experience.   I now realize that with a greater capacity of patience comes a greater feeling of despair when you finally get filled to the brim.&nbsp; Last night I found myself unexpectedly cooped up in my room with all the lights out under the covers sighing every twenty seconds or so.&nbsp; Clear signs of depression.&nbsp; I didn't get out of bed until right now.&nbsp; I can't even remember the last time I felt like this.&nbsp; Maybe it was back in college when I worked so hard on my thesis proposal only to get rejected when I was finally about to defend it.&nbsp; That was ages ago!   But so unlike me, I have been keeping in all the complaints and frustrations about my surroundings for quite some time now.&nbsp; I block out these feelings by trying to focus on the positive side of things.&nbsp; Again, so  unlike me .&nbsp; I found myself bitching extremely less than normal, if not none at all.&nbsp; I thought this was a really good sign of change, a good sign of mastering the art of patience.&nbsp; Phsssshhhh...bullshit!&nbsp; I was killing my spirit in the process.&nbsp; Someone once reminded me "that too much of anything is bad for you."&nbsp; I think in essence, too much of goodness is bad for you, too.   My point, aside from my bitching?&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; Balance.&nbsp; I need a balance from patience and bitching.&nbsp; I need to be able to release both in equal amounts.&nbsp; Man, have I got a lot to learn.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I'll have a lot of crappy nights in bed either feeling despair or frustration from lack of one or the other...But for now I just want to be selfish.&nbsp; I haven't thought about myself in ages.&nbsp; I always put other people first before myself ever since I've acquired my new gift of patience.&nbsp; Sad thing is, no one puts me first in their life&nbsp;so I feel cheated.&nbsp;   So there you go.&nbsp; Selfish it is.&nbsp;

      Last night I fell asleep anticipating a phone call that never came.&nbsp; It's all good.&nbsp; I'm getting real old and, for me, spending a Saturday night on the telephone after watching a DVD was actually my gimmick already!&nbsp; Normally, an anticipated phone call that never comes would have driven me up the wall, but now I just shrug it off as things being the way they are and go one with my life, in this case I&nbsp;just went on with my more boring than usual evening.&nbsp; I was so un-anxious that I fell asleep while waiting!&nbsp;   I was rewarded when I woke up this morning though, because after so many months I finally hear my best bud Dre's voice on the phone.&nbsp; He called unannounced!&nbsp; We haven't talked on the phone in ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since Dre moved to the States, things around here has just not been the same.&nbsp; Regular things that we used to do just don't seem as much fun.&nbsp; Hence, my staying-home-more-often-than-not syndrome.&nbsp; Oddly, when I did speak to Dre, our conversation seemed like he was still living 15 minutes away.&nbsp; No catching up at all!&nbsp; We spoke like there hasn't been any space barrier between us.&nbsp; Mainly we talked about a friend's gig and our favorite TV show,  Six Feet Under  (which he is now seeing a season ahead of me!)&nbsp;.&nbsp; I told him about my Saturday gimmick, and it turns out that his Saturday gimmick was worse:&nbsp; he was  working !  As mentioned,&nbsp; since Dre left I haven't been going out much either.&nbsp; At first I thought it was because I was lamenting his departure or something.&nbsp; But now I realized that it was all just a coincidence.&nbsp; My peeling myself away from doing the same things over and over on Saturdays was just me telling myself that it's not the kind of life I want to have right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturdays in Alabang&nbsp;are usually spent drinking in someone's house together with a bunch of guys I grew up with.&nbsp; Most of the time I listen to them&nbsp;complain about&nbsp;chics (too much of it or the lack thereof) and how they needed a new gimmick since life was getting boring.  I've been hiding from Saturday nights spent like that.&nbsp; Since I don't like shmoozing in Makati bars either, I'd really rather stay home now.&nbsp; At this point in my life, what I&nbsp;find as things important are:&nbsp; &nbsp;finding a job I like, making sure my family is intact, keeping contact with friends I value and pleasing the guy I like.&nbsp; I think I have all of the above  for the moment , so I'm pretty much&nbsp;content.&nbsp; Right now, I don't really need to be anywhere else on Saturday nights but sitting at home with my contentment.

      Last night, right before I crossed over to Morpheus' realm, I was thinking about my life.&nbsp; Last year  I found myself .&nbsp; I lost what I value most in&nbsp;life:  my pride .&nbsp; I felt naked and unsure of myself, always second guessing my actions.&nbsp; Back then, before the dreaming world took over, I would unrelentlessly torture myself by thinking that I have lost my old self and  this , whatever it was, was the new me.&nbsp; I wrote a lot of poetry that year, more than any other year in my life, and all of it was about mourning my dead spirit.&nbsp; I really believed that I had lost my old self and this new  loser  has emerged which was who I was going to be permanently.&nbsp; Thank God I woke up from that nightmare.&nbsp; What I had lost I had found again.&nbsp; I emerged from the dark smiling because not only did I rediscover myself and realized that it wasn't damaged, I also realized that I had obtained so many new qualities, too. &nbsp; The most important was   patience  .&nbsp; My short fuse seems to have been replaced by an unbelievably long one.&nbsp; Even  I  am amazed by how long my patience can last.&nbsp; I seem to give more&nbsp;people a chance now.&nbsp; I always strive to see the good in most of them (even though deep inside a lot still don't deserve it!).&nbsp; When I do see the bad, I seem to still find the positive in them because what good will it do me if I did otherwise?&nbsp; People who've known me for years say that the change is evident.&nbsp; I remember one of my very best friends  Ingrid &nbsp; (who just came back from the States then) say "Wow, Pam, you're still the same old you but so different at the same time.&nbsp; I can see it just sitting here with the way you talk and the way you act."&nbsp;  &nbsp; Through my new found patience I am less stressed about the dumbest things that I used to dwell on.&nbsp; For example, if some girl looked at me from head to toe (my biggest pet peeve),&nbsp;I would brew about how best to torture her by giving her a really slow death.&nbsp; Now, when it happens, I usually just brush it off with a frown and go on with my life. &nbsp; I think the reason why my relationships with people are going so smoothly nowadays is because of my patience as well.&nbsp; It has changed my disposition immensely.&nbsp; I would bend my rules first without even thinking if the other party would bend theirs for me, too.&nbsp; I've realized that pissing contests are a waste of time so I refuse to participate in them.&nbsp; I know I'm good at it anyway, so if I find myself needing to participate in one, I know for myself that I can do a pretty good job at it.&nbsp; No sense in proving it every single time,&nbsp;especially when things are pretty shallow. &nbsp; I rarely fight with people at home.&nbsp; I rarely fight with people  period.&nbsp;   &nbsp; I can't explain it but somehow my perspective in life and my personal relationships have changed a great deal.&nbsp; I'm gonna say it has changed for the better because my good friend  Kat  says I look really happy.&nbsp; I remember I asked her how she knew I was happy (because I myself didn't know if I was) and she said, " because it comes out in your eyes ." &nbsp; I guess I'm not so dead anymore.&nbsp; Life is funny.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;feels a lot&nbsp;like a rollercoaster.&nbsp; It gets you really high up, only to bring you back down.&nbsp; When you're&nbsp;in a slump it feels like forever compared to when you're high on life and time just flies by you.&nbsp; Most people never learn and fear the slump parts of life.&nbsp; For me, I look forward to them.&nbsp; They're not only challenging, but very humbling as well.&nbsp; No fail, at the end of that rotten road theres a&nbsp;better you that always emerges.&nbsp; I'm always excited to see how I've evolved in the end. &nbsp; I wonder when I'm gonna be given the chance to find myself again.&nbsp;  Herman Hessey  wrote in his book   Damien   that "the most distasteful thing to man is to find the path that leads to himself."&nbsp; Very true.&nbsp; I think &nbsp;that's why people who refuse to take the path to themselves in turn never change.&nbsp; I'm lucky that I was kind of shoved to that path last year, hence having no choice but to take it.

      Today I spent the afternoon in the mall doing what I do best— mallrat .  I think I’m too old to mallrat, but I’ve been doing it since high school and when a slow day gets even slower, the mall is where I seem to gravitate.  I don’t go to the mall to window shop.  Nor do I go to the mall to schmooze or catch the happy hour.  I go to the mall for the best entertainment— to people watch .  Yes, my mundane life is made more exciting when I go to the mall to look at people passing by.  It may not look like a lot of fun, but when you think about it the mall has a lot of potential.  All you really need is a good eye for spotting things that make you laugh, a cynical mind to shrug of your guilt and a dose of shallowness to appreciate the even more ordinary things in life.   Here are my favorite common mall finds:     The Common Masochist.    Generally in their early twenties to their late thirties, these women strut around the mall in their halter tops, short fru-fru skirts and 4-inch stilettos.  A mall is where you usually go shopping, right?  That means a lot of walking is involved, hence, thirty minutes in heels will start to kill your feet for sure!  Another common mall purpose is to watch a movie.  Our theatres are usually freezers, why shiver in your close-to-nothing wardrobe when you can just go to the mall in movie-appropriate clothing?  Somebody please tell me why these people insist on torturing themselves!?!    Inappropriately Lost Lovers.    Many malls today have benches to sit on so you can rest your tired feet from shopping.  I kid you not—some people actually think these places are hang-out spots!  I have seen couples whisper sweet nothings to each other’s ears on mall benches!  I mean, please people who walk by can see you, you know?  And not many of us have strong stomachs!    Lemmings.    Teenagers who don’t have personality, they copy what the other is wearing and only vary in color.  I’m sure you see them all the time.  How can you miss them?  They wear the same hipster pants, the same tight shirts (that only come in pastel colors) and the same sneakers.  You notice them but when you  really look , you see blank faces.  I swear I can hear them baa-baa their way down the escalator amongst the other twittering fools around them.    The Lurkers.    Although I am guilty of lurking, what I mean to address are the new breed of lurkers: people who lurk  in the bathroom .  Ever since the nice bathrooms in Glorietta and Rustan’s came out, a lot of people have been hanging out in bathrooms.  For god knows what reason, I am unable fathom.  These bathrooms charge like 10 bucks.  Why pay cash to hang out in a place that smells like piss?  And I don’t think it’s a maintenance problem because, guess what?  A bathroom is where people are actually supposed to go to piss!  If you really like the aroma, then why don’t you go buy yourself some ammonia and sniff it?  Or invite friends over to your bathroom and hang there.  Believe me, it’s a lot cheaper that way.  Alas, last and certainly not the least, these people make people watching worth my while…    The Genuine Weirdos.    This blog is actually dedicated to them.  Those people who stand out and catch a regular mallrat’s eye.  Although they vary in form and intensity, these people are the sole reason why I go to the mall to people watch because they give me raw entertainment.  I am awe-struck every time, it never fails.  I was in Glorietta once on my way to watch a film (mind you, in the shirt I’d slept in and my brother’s really long shorts with my black tsinelas) when my friend pulled my arm to catch my attention.  He was pointing at an odd looking old couple.  The woman was wearing unbelievably thick make-up that did nothing to flatter her already age-ridden face.  She had disco blue eye shadow to match her really orange cheeks and blood-red lips.  Her hair looked like it was frozen with hairspray—I swear if a lizard fell on her head it would get lost in there for eternity.  She had a rainbow umbrella that matched her rainbow dress.  She was arguing with the man she was with who matched her outfit perfectly.  He had on navy pants, a red cap and rubber boots!   Rubber boots to the mall!   To date, I don’t think I’ve seen anyone weirder than they.  I remember my friend wishing he had his digital camera so he could take a picture with them.  They were such a site that he wanted to be in the picture with them!  They reminded me of the “weirdos” that Enid called Satanists in  Ghost World .  I know, I know.  Most of you are probably gonna say I’m mean.  Hey, guess what?   I am mean !  But think about it this way: without these people my life would be  that  much of a bore.  I wouldn’t know how to pass time on extremely slow days.  In turn, these people’s lives won’t be as exhilarating without bored cynics like me.  So to those of you who people watch as well, if you come across me and think I’m weird by your standards, by all means,go ahead and insult me!

      Not a long time ago, some weird girl confronted me about how she couldn’t stand me.  When I asked her why, her crazy reply was “Because you talk about sex all the time!”  You can just imagine how my dumb-founded reaction to that looked like.  I mean, who gets pissed at people for mundane reasons like that?  In my head of course I was thinking  “I do not!”    So I asked my ever-present friends (which are all, unfortunately, testosterone filled boys) if that was true and they in turn answered no.  However, now that I have been in contact with my numerous—not to mention, long absent—girlfriends, guess what our constant topic of conversation is?  SEX—of course!  You think guys are the only ones who talk about sex?  Ha!  Whoever grew up believing that is a fool.  Ever since I got curious with the opposite sex I have openly been talking about sex in Cat’s blue bathroom while painting our toe nails with Ingrid.  I think girls are even worse than guys when they talk about it.  Because when girls talk, they don’t degrade the guys by treating them like trophies.  There are no  “Man, she was so hot for me I made her scream my name all night!”   comments.  We don’t brag nor do we embellish the way men do for the sole purpose of competing with each other’s machisimo insecurities.  When girls talk about sex, we talk about it bluntly and the way it really is.  What’s best about it is that we compare notes and share notes to make ourselves better at it.   I also think that it’s healthy when girls talk about sex—to each other or to their male friends.    1.  It means they’re secure about themselves as sexual beings.       It’s never good to suppress anything since we all know      suppression can get you in trouble.  Personally, I think our      little feisty friend has this problem.   2.  I think it’s a turn on for guys, too, if chics can talk about      sex openly.    3.  Talking about sex makes you a better lover.  In turn, talking      about it gets you what you want as well.  STOP.  Before I become a  Sex and the City  column, I wanna stop and say that I didn’t intend this piece to be the new  Xerex .  All I simply wanted to do was (1) bring to people’s attention that today I realized girls talk about sex more than guys and (2) to show that bitch who told me she didn’t like me because I talked about sex all the time that   Ha! I’m normal!  I’m healthy and not depressingly suppressed!  Plus, I always get what I want and most likely am a better lover than you!    *hands on my hips with matching tongue sticking out*  Since I can  only  talk about sex all the time, maybe that’s what got me into law school, too.  Maybe we can discuss taxation and contracts sometime, I’m sure she can out-argue me since, you know, I can only talk about sex all the time.  Fucking psycho.  Question for the Week:   “Do you know how long its been since I last had sex?”   I got asked this 3 times this week!  Jesus.  This blog may  vindicate  the weird girl’s reason for hating me.  But my sarcasm has taken the better of me.   Vindicate  is Herbo’s word for the week.    ">....sorry for the ranting and raving this morning guys, just had the urge to write something with a sardonic umph to it.....

      I was looking around the net on this lazy Sunday afternoon when I came across a testing website I followed from a friend's live journal.  I decided to take the   "Where are you on the Highway of life?"   test.  I was a bit curious and wanted to know what I would say if I came across myself as a road sign.  I love going on roadtrips so its only fitting that my curiosity was tickled.  Can you guess what my road sign would say?              pamromualdez Highway    Contentment Meadows    3      Bewilderment Avenue    23      County Jail    39      Study Hall    129      TravelWorld    516      Please Drive Carefully               Username:      urlLink Where are you on the highway of life?

      About a week or so ago, a friend called me asking why her yellow pad had scribbles on it that looked like my handwriting.  She was worried that I had split personality or something because the scribbles looked like there were two people conversing in writing.  It turned out that it was a game my good friend  Ton  and I were playing.  But for someone to actually think that I could  really  have a split personality disorder!  Now that I think about it, if you look at my  Friendster  account, most of my testimonials from close friends and acquaintances alike say one thing in common:   I’m crazy . This got me thinking, maybe I am borderline insane.  I may not have a split personality disorder but I am obsessively impulsive  with anything .  I do plunge into everything headfirst without thinking and just worry about things when I get there.  To site a few impulsive moves I’ve made:  1.  All my tattoos are there not because they were well thought-of but an idea that sprung due to a slow, lazy day or some need to do something different because I was bored.     the tattoo that started it all   2.  I dedicated a whole blog on how I was dared to shave my head.  Going Sigourney was out of impulse as well.  3.  Just yesterday, I was watching  Blind Horizon  and thought to myself  “Shit Neve Campbell’s hair rocks here.  I want her eighties look,”  so I went to the salon and chopped off my already growing hair (that I previously wanted to maintain).   Short Side Story:   I’m so broke these days that Ton actually thought I had cut my own hair.  Again, something crazy enough that only  I would do .      Before and After   4.  Now that I’m broke, there are so many things I really need and can’t buy.  Looking back, so many of my useless things were because of impulsive buying.  A good example is my Imelda collection of flip-flops.   I own around 25 pairs !  Really, who needs 25 pairs of  tsinelas ?!?  Despite all these seemingly negative results due to my reckless nature in going about things, this trait has also brought good qualities in me.  For example:  1.  So few can go up to a guy they like and actually say “ Hey, I like you. ”  I have no problem admitting that to someone I’m interested in.  I account most of that to my ability to make rash decisions without giving it half a thought.     my ultimate crush.  when I finally met him, i blurted out "i love you" without even thinking.  i was a doofus, but real nontheless.   2.  If a friend had the urge or need to leave tomorrow to go to some far off place and made the fortunate mistake to ask me, I will say yes without thinking about the consequences.     to date, my most gung-ho trip was to Sagada for the weekend with Dre.  We told our parents we were going to the beach, but really, we wanted to see how a 24 hour road trip would be like   3.  A lot of the fun I manufacture emanates from this “do, don’t think” attitude I have.  4.  I am frank because I say exactly what I feel without thinking.  I don’t know how to do it any other way.  5.  It has become my trademark, some sort of divergent identity.  People always shake their heads and say, “That’s such a Pam thing to do.”     trying to french lucy, something only I would attempt to do

      I’ve always hated money.  I’ve seen many friendships and even families get destroyed only because of money.  Yet I can’t ignore the fact that it is such a necessity in our lives.  Money  does  make the world go round.  I write this blog today because I am sitting in front of my PC broke.  I have zero cash to my name.  I have  nothing , not even assets to sell to make cash.  And in the midst of my poverty, I sit here not wishing to have money, but wishing for it to disappear.  My idea of Utopia is of a world without any currency.  Why?  Mainly because of the following:  1.	Without money, the equality issue will be abolished. 2.	Barter would be our means of acquiring things.  You build relationships with people through bartering. 3.	Everyone has equal access to basic necessities.  Poverty will no longer be an issue.  Wouldn’t the world be a perfect place without this root of greed called money?  What is it about this small piece of paper that has so much power?  If you really think about it, the idea is really absurd that it ticks me off that I can’t do anything about it.      Pink Floyd  said it best in their song   Money   from their   Dark Side of the Moon   album.   Money, get away Get a good job with more pay and your O.K. Money it's a gas Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash New car, caviar, four star daydream, Think I'll buy me a football team Money get back      I'm all right Jack keep your hands off my stack. Money it's a hit Don't give me that do goody good bullshit I'm in the hi-fidelity first class traveling set And I think I need a Lear jet Money it's a crime Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie Money so they say Is the root of all evil today But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're giving none away    “Money it’s a crime.  Share it fairly but don’t take a slice of my pie.  Money, so they say, is the root of all evil today.”   -- Cold, brutal, dirty and beautifully captured by the brilliance of the wordings of Roger Waters.  I hate money.  It instills greed.  It is a cause of desperation.  What good does it bring to the world?

      I know I know, I was bitching about how I only had twenty minutes of peace during my trip in my last blog. But now that I have  pictures , I stand corrected!     yes, I climbed with a group of lemmings, but as you can see, my friends and I stood out from the yellow herd in nothing-special clothing that brought out our individuality.            As I summited, I was greeted by an overcast sky that was preparing for the sunset (note the reflection of the hidden sun on the water...)           the sunset was the main attraction of the afternoon...        ...as it casted a golden reflection upon our faces        After dinner, Karen and I pose for a supposed-stolen-shot in the middle of belting out Pink Floyd duets under the twilight            Ah...nothing like waking up to breakfast with (A) the cook (B) cooking an amazing italian scrambled egg (with real mozzarella cheese!) and (C) her boyfriend salivating at the sight of either the food or a great potential future wife (you be the judge!)            ...and this greets me as I prepare to go down the mountai n...   For those of you who  don't understand , I think this is all worth the huffing and puffing going up and down some silly little mountain.  This is what resets me .  Note: Thanks to Jay-Z for the pictures. Cheers to friends who sit on ridges to share a smoke, old or new!

      Yesterday I  came back from a climb.  It was an easy mountain, nothing challenging, nothing breath-taking, and somewhere in the middle of my huffing and puffing on the way up I even thought, "I should've just stayed home with my couch and cable."  Nontheless, today I feel the Monday blues just as badly, if not worse.  Looking back, I did have  one moment  of serenity.  It was a full moon, I was on top of a ridge smoking a joint overlooking the view of some sea in the twilight.   It was peaceful for a good twenty minutes.  When I got back Ton asked me if I was able to "reset."  I gave him a shrug for an answer.  I really didn't know.  But now I feel the Monday blues, a feeling reminiscent of how I dread work right after a climb in the past.  Maybe I wasn't able to reset fully, but that one moment of quiet, that one piece of nature I was able to see again was good for me.  A bit of remedy to cure my really bad case of city fever.  So now I sit in from of my PC at home procrastinating to the last possible moment before I have to really peel myself away from here and force myself to dress up and get ready for that ride to Makati--where the feeling of being in the city is stronger than any other place.  I sigh.  The price we have to pay for our freedom.  You get older, you get to do whatever you want, but it also means a bigger responsibility you'll have to face.  What a trade off.  I hate mondays...
