      Hello, I’m back again………. Friday was simply great; I did wear a saree after all. Since I live close to work (about a 5 min drive) my friends made me go home and change into a saree. Luckily my mum was at home so she draped the saree for me. The weekend was pretty busy. I met up with a few of my old office friends on Sunday after nearly 2 years. It was a huge effort on Ash’s part to get all of us together, but she did it nevertheless. It was really nice catching up on what has been going on and most surprising was, after we spoke for sometime, we realized most of our colleagues in office are either married or have a baby!!!!! We all met up at Barista and sat there for about 2 hours just catching up on what we had missed. Jerry is now a manager doing Strategic Planning (playing Sin) :o), Dhanya and Ash are trainers, Bryan is a Quality Analyst, Anne is back in college and Sujit and Conrad are doing very well for themselves. Gayathri who apparently didn’t turn up on Sunday, is now in charge of training. Three years back, all of us just out of college, looking for some place to start our careers. We got to know each other better and sooner than we realized we were good friends. All of us were in one team fortunately J and we continued to work together. Being our first job, every one was very enthusiastic, especially Ash, she would come to work even on her days off; our manager had to literally drive her back home. It was these friends who like a dose of caffeine, kept me awake during night shifts (2:30 am – 11:30 am).They were one of the reasons I looked forward to going to work (and the salary also :0) We used to go sometimes to a resort on team outing’s and we used to have a ball. Getting back to work next morning was a problem, but that’s beside the point. Little by little, people started leaving; Sujit was the first one and then Anne, then Connie and Brian and then me. Ash, Gayathri, Dhanya and Jerry still work in the same place. As months and years went by, we lost touch; everyone was so busy doing their own thing but the evening out on Sunday was an ice-breaker. It was like re-living the good times we had, how this first job has molded our future, our personality and not forgetting the precious friends we made. There is nothing better than the pleasant memories you carry with you as you move ahead in life.

       12th August After a long thought about what to post in my second blog, I am still clueless and my imagination seems to abscond when I need it the most. Well here I go anyway…….just another day at work, that too not too much of it. It’s not very nice when you finish your work at the beginning of that day and then you have about 3-4 hours left with nothing to do. I wish I could go home instead L 13th August I am back again, this is the second day and it’s taken me around 24 hours to write a few lines. Since the  Indian Independence Day  falls on a Sunday (waste of a good public holiday) we are having Independence Day celebrations in office today. To celebrate the spirit of Independence we decided to dress in Indian Traditional clothes. I conveniently forgot about it and realized this just before I could leave from home this morning and it was too late to decide to wear a saree. The Saree is the Indian Traditional Dress worn by the women. It is usually 5-6 yards longs and is draped around the waist in a very beautiful and elegant way which I don’t think I will ever be able to master. It takes me hours to wear the saree and even after that it looks like I’ve just wrapped a bed sheet around myselfL. A Saree comes in different fabrics, Chiffon, Georgette, Silk and Cotton, to name a few. There is a particular type of saree with a lot of gold thread woven in the fabric, this is called ‘Zari’ and it is the most beautiful Indian Dress I have ever seen. Everything is so colorful here, we’ve got the Indian flags all over the office and everyone looks so bright and beautiful in Indian Clothes. I’m off to celebrate our Independence……..bye
