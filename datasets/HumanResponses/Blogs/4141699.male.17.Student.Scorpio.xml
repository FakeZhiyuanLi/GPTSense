      Today I recieved a call from a somewhat frantic  urlLink Elise . She was in a store that specialized in British items. Alright, so maybe I was the more frantic one. =). There was a bedset with the Union Jack on it! The only problem is that a comforter isn't included in the set! I  however  would be much more satisfied with a simple mug with the flag on it...Still no flat mate. =(. I am still waiting. I wonder when everyones going to show up!

      I officially love blogspot. Its very...controllable, yet user friendly. I love my layout! Anyway. =). Again, I mention I have  not  been told my flat mate and room assignment, and I will be arriving there in less than two weeks. Oh well. Jennifer says be prepared for the worst. I am -trying-.  A word of politics: China needs to be sent the right message by America and is not being sent one--and so it proceeds to walk all over American foreign policy. The president should have balls enough to support the independence of a capitalist democracy, Taiwan, autonomous for a very long time, from the despotic rule of undemocratic communist China.  The United States sells Taiwan weapons to defend itself against its what the US claims is its rightful owner. The 'One-China' policy is wretched and should be destroyed. What is China going to do? Stop manufacturing? Thats going to happen. *rolls eyes*.

      My blog is now ad-free. An empty white box is better than an ugly flashing ad anyway, no? =) Working on the profile and sidebar items.

      Just one more week, four more days, and seven more hours until takeoff; and so my independent life finally begins. Several friends of mine have already  receieved  their 'flat mates' and assignments--I have not, and I am -so- anxious to recieve mine. To hell with it.

      It's friday, and I still do not have my flat mate OR a room.  I faxed over more information to those incompetent fools at Residence Life. They said everything should be squared away now and to call back next week. I hate bureaucracies.  I'm so mad. To hell with preparing for the worst with my roomate, I think I had better start getting prepared  for dealing with -this- kind of  rubbish  for the next four years. Come on! What am I paying $40,000/ year for? Anyway.  urlLink Maria  made this awesome button for me! Check it out =) and link to me!    And if you're a member of the board and would like to link to the board on your site, Maria has made  three  choices:      .  Enjoy, and once again thanks to  urlLink Maria  for all these buttons...She's a teenage genius.

      Roomate! Roomate! Roomate!  Those incompetent fools at Residence Life finally pulled through and said that I have been assigned. However, the woman who gives out the assignments won't be back in her office until Thursday, which is when I'll know. Again, I repeat, incompetent fools.  I have to start packing. :(. Byebye my beautiful city. *sigh* I shall return!
