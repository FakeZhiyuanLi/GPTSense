      Disclaimer: This is a true story. And therefore, also long and a wee bit boring. Apologies.  Dragging myself to my last lecture of the semester, in the early hours of the afternoon, I felt quietly confident about the prospect of my life not changing much in the following 24 hours. I was going through the motions - feigning interest in what the lecturer was saying, engaging in epic battles with the audio-visual equipment for my own presentation, and passing around biscuits. My relief at having survived the semester perhaps left me a bit short of oxygen to the brain, because the next thing I knew I was fraternizing wildly with "George" (Oh, who am I trying to kid? That is his real name) at the pub. Oblivious.  [NB. George is a guy I'm always sitting next to and eating (for some reason) mandarins in front of. We never speak properly. He usually starts a conversation but unfortunately I happen to be eating a mandarin and only manage to nod and smile. Once, I tried chasing the mandarin with a coffee (not recommended) and that got a semi-decent chat going between us. Ahh, but then I leaped away to the ladies (like a gazelle). Maybe he got the impression that I'm aloof and interesting from my garbled silences and bounding away at unexpected moments. Maybe the whole "act like a cat" routine really does work. Fancy that...]  Anyway, we all have stories about drunken liasons but I have to confess this was my first. All previous liasons were very straightforward and in no way involved people I studied/worked with. Did my standards take a massive tumble over the last 5 years? No doubt, being single for a year and the coldness of the winter months did sway me a little. This combination is trouble, driving us all into the arms of nice but incredibly unlikely people in the most unlikely ways.   So we end up going off campus to catch up with my friends. They leave the pub at 10pm. An incredibly drunk-in-a-philosophical-way guy pulls up a chair and engages in a debate with us about whether the statement "Elvis was a Redneck" is justified - we began in the affirmative because he took the negative and eventually both parties slid towards a middle-ground - very excitng stuff to watch diplomacy in action (in this case mine, cos the guys seemed intent on holding on to their own prejudices). Before we knew it it was 3am. What a stupid time of the morning to be roaming about with a "friend" who happens to live 5 minutes away. Oblivious still.  Did I mention that he wanted a pit-stop at his place, before we headed to the pub with my friends, to "find his keys"? The quotation marks are more there because of my feelings in hindsight than from any real mistrust of George. And he did end up having to borrow his housemates keys after all. And I got to see his total demolition site of a room, replete with drum kit (one drum and two cymbals, c'mon...) and poster of Johnny Rotten (right next to the bed, I was impressed the next morning). I think I should have gained some sort of insight into his personality then that would have prevented me from doing anything stupid. Being disorganised and absent-minded just made him more attractive to me. The "act like an intellectual" routine - sheee. Smitten.  So to cut the embarrassing bit short (did you see how I evaded it for an entire paragraph?), we drunkenly (I mean, passionately) embraced and kissed and made each others' arm go numb where we had stopped for a break. It was nice. We didn't do "it" either (which is always classy, right?). However, there wasn't a centimeter between us all night and hands were played with and fingers kissed. I prefer to remember him saying "I could just scoop you up" to "It's a good thing you're here or I'd be cold". But perhaps this is where I went wrong in my calculations. Boy Meets Girl and Has An Amazing Night....OR....Poor Uni Student Meets Potential Source of Body Heat and Has A Warm Night, For A Change. Wouldn't put it past him, now. Suspicious.  Now, you say? What has happened since to make you so bitter? Well, just keep on reading.  Wednesday: Attraction! Flirtation! Connection! Thursday: Evaporation! Paranoia! (mine) Confusion! (mine)  Okay, so we were incredibly hungover in the morning. Very mellowed out. So mellow that, once out of bed, we didn't really talk or touch. I put it down to my flusteredness (he had walked in from the shower, dripping wet and put his boxer briefs on in front of me - under a towel...but still!). *Faints*  He had asked me to have breakfast with him at a cafe around the corner (because he wanted to prolong the niceness...OR...because he had an empty fridge??). We had a good chat. I think he became alarmed when I ordered blueberry pancakes with maple syrup AND grapefruit soda (must think I'm a sugar fiend or incapable of making compatible food choices). We both had hands stuffed firmly in our jackets as we walked to the Library. We muttered something about wishing each other luck during the exams. We hugged and said the obligatory "I had a really nice time" - how bitter do I sound?? It's incredible that we went through the entire morning as if nothing had happened. And, halfway home I realised I didn't get his number nor he mine. Which brings me to the even more embarrassing bits...keep reading. Oh, unless you're bored to death with this tale of romantic incompetence. I would be too. But there's a comedic value in it, somewhere...under all the PAIN...I'm just being melodramatic to get you to be interested, don't worry. Pseudo-melodramatic.  On Friday, I bit the bullet and phoned him...at WORK! My reasoning was: better to call him and sort this out once and for all. I couldn't even do that properly. He works in a bookshop and so when I momentarily lost my cool, I blurted out a request for "Satantic Verses" followed by a request for George to the very puzzled but nice Scottish-accent on the phone. I really hope she didn't mention this to George - he knows that I work in a MUCH better bookshop and would hardly need to use his. He said he too forgot to get my number. Right. Gave me his and I practically force-fed him mine. I bailed from the conversation when I remembered he was at work and, though he seemed happy to chat, I was beginning to feel a bit deflated and unsure about how to think about this. Perplexed.  On Saturday at work, new guy Leighton (who I find out also works at George's bookshop - whaaa?!) confirms that George is a bona fide Good Guy - they've, y'know, jammed and stuff over the last three years. Aaaaarrgh. I'm looking for a different set of credentials here Leighton but thanks anyway cos now I know the best strategy may indeed be to ask whether George needs a harmonica player. Optimistic.  On Monday, I'm wracked with paranoia and I really just want to clear this situation up into something that makes sense to me. So I do the thing that any self-respecting waiter of a phonecall should NOT do - I preempt his call by calling him first. My reasoning: what if he lost my number, like he lost his keys (no quotation marks now)?! His housemate tells me "George is out" which I then analysed to ridiculous lengths - maybe she was on orders to deflect all calls from unexplained girls? Paranoid. Very Paranoid.  Wednesday, 16th June: Bloomsday 2004. Thanks James Joyce for giving me an excuse to call this guy yet again. This time the boy was actually around, though it appears he has to be shouted at several times from the bottom of the stairs - he was playing his drum. He keeps greeting me with "hey man" - is this good? It smacks to me of my own diversionary tactic of refering to someone as "dude". So we discuss Joyce - I alarm him yet again by confessing to have read only the first and eighteenth chapters as a way of economising my time between essay-writing. And some of my paranoia is evaporating away because we're having a genuinely great time. I think by this point it was fair of me to expect him to say something about us - I had already shown my interest by calling him twice. Nothing. I got the impression he was very stressed about exams and was enjoying the break from studying. Not time to broach anything deep and meaningful then. Said something along the lines of "we should catch up in the holidays". Impatient.   He tells me he'll be in the Library on Thursday but, feeling foolish about this whole business, I decided not to turn up in time to catch him there. Bad plan because he was still there when I turned up. I swear I 'm not stalking the guy - though he IS shortsighted and so I very easily could. Worse still I was getting stupidly happy about seeing him there. It being exactly a week since I'd last seen him, I had hoped it would break this accursed effect he was having on me. Also, he was pretty sleep-deprived, stressed and hair unbrushed. Maybe also he was dressing to repel...will nothing turn me off? I try guaging whether his arms are too short - anything to kill the attraction - but it doesn't work. I manage to make him laugh a bit and then he opts for a nap over a coffee with me. Almost blurted out "want some company?".   I'm in real trouble with this guy. We have similar interests but really different personalities - he likes ambiguity and I'm a mess if there's too much of it. According to my astrology-obsessed friend - I must, being a Capricorn with Gemini rising, try to "out-Aquarius him". This sounds stupid enough to work, if I can figure out what it means. Giving it a rest until the end of the exams at least, by George!
