      Ugh i hate mississippi weather in the morning.. If running is so good for you why does it take so much energy to make yourself do it??? This morning while running it felt like FOREVER till i was done...I must say it does feel good once i am done running..so why is it so hard to do it??? I used to actually want to run last year, yeah well new year..i do not love it this year..   well rob just stopped by and they are making him go to the field for five days..man i hate the military..he is leaving to greece for a year already, can I please have the time I do have left with him spent here at home..I think the military is run by a bunch of men who hate their home life and do not get listened to so they make it a point to be assholes at work. I have made a promise to myself that I will not be bitchy and i will be patient with people, but geez these people make it hard to stay civil. Its like being with kids ALL day..These grown men act like they can't do anything..I feel like yelling I am not your wife get off your ass and do it yourself. but that would be insubordination, can't have that can we,lets all be team players now..Sorry for all the gripping. :)

      letme back track a little here, friday started as any other day it was supposed to be "fun day"  gotta love it where they make it mandatory to have fun and play sports.. Well before the events started they called out names to congratulate the people that received excellence on their physical fitness.. ha ha imagine my surprise when they called out my name.. wow.. most people would be thankful they watched their weight and didn't eat carbs, i am NOT that kind of person..as soon as i got a break in the day i picked up rob and took him to an early fathers day meal at my FAVORITE place TGI FRIDAYS. We drank alot and shared some appetizers. Yup gotta keep fit. Hey the drink had strawberrys in it isn't that healthy?? And in my defense I did move touch the celery..(off the plate)   urlLink    lunch&nbsp; urlLink

      time is 10pm and i am getting ready for bed. last night we fought because we don't sleep together if he is leaving and is so hurt about it i don't see why he doesn't sleep with me, he doesn't want me to get a job because itll interfere with our time yeah whatever, that is why i am here alone while he is at a friends house. i feel so torn... he is a good man....he has put up with alot..but how long are you indebted to someone when they loved you at your worst...do you have to forever be obliged to them???at this rate i will never repay him for his love at the time i needed it..however the days and years have gone by and i require a different love now.no longer am i satisified with knowing we are under the same roof, a feeling of content that once held me here i need to be held and told..a year without the one you live and breathe for..i don't know who is supposed to overcome that...it is such a nasty thing to ask of someone..yet the navy feels it is the best way of life..yeah and they wonder why the divorce rate is so high among dual military members...at times it feels like being punched in the stomach when i think of him leaving.like you can not breathe and the world has turned upside down... at times it feels like a relief a chance at peace.that feeling only lasts for a moment and than a big wave engulfs me and i can't think or talk i feel so lost when he is gone..if this is the man god intended for me why is it so hard..for so long i have chased him and hunted him never letting him breathe on his own...i am terrified if i let him out on his own the things he will discover..not so much not trusting him.i just lost sight of who i was and what it is that is so wonderful in me that keeps him here..somewhere along this bumpy road that we have traveled together i have lost who i was...i feel like a shawdow of what i once was or ever hoped to be...i feel if he feels the easyness of life without the distractions of a wife and two baby boys.....well...who would want that at such a young age...believe me it wasn't planned...but where do you go from here when real life has taken you whole and swallowed you with no hope of letting go...either succomb to it or you drown.&nbsp; he thinks i portray myself as the victim in our relationship to everyone LORD knows i am no angel i have made my mistakes i have done stuff in my life that i am not proud of...everyone takes a different path to the life that they &nbsp;lead..i wish i would have gotten &nbsp;here the easy way but i did not&nbsp;i am trying to do the best with what i have...&nbsp;i have a good man i know i do there are things i wish i could change about us together and individually.."you knew how i was before we got married" is usually the response i get from him when i tell him of my unhappiness yeah true i did but i hoped our extra activicties would change and grow...you can only hang out and drink for so long before quit all that and you start planning for the future... please don't take this as bashing him (i am not))i am merely expressing my frustration and my emotions..someone out there has to be feeling this or at least has been there.no one starts at fine and perfect and if they say they do or did they are lying..YOU ARE NOT PERFECT AND NEITHER IS YOUR LIFE OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP SO GET OFF OF YOUR HORSE!!!! their will always be haters to try and break up what you have don't let them..they are only unhappy in their life and their happinness is determined by making you miserable..i have met these people and they SUCK!!!!!! SO THERE B-IO-TCH-ES YOU CAN'T GET ME DOWN!!

      Well tonight was pretty boring started cleaning went walking around pets mart anything and everything but clean out my car from my weekend trip to Texas and go online to class. This is the last online class I will ever take. Mentally I am already preparing myself to pay this class back, you can't win 'em all:( It is so hard you have to be mentally disciplined to go on nightly i love the classroom enviorment, I love the feedback you get from the others I don't do well with sitting in front of a computer. I am young and my husband is a computer genius so you would figure some of his knowledge would rub off on me but NOPE--give me a  pen and pencil anyday.. I got to see my husband last night for a couple of hours (highlight of my weekend).. I wish i would have taken my camera to texas this weekend because my son got his first big scrape on his forehead and on his knee..my baby is so strong..

      How many times have you asked for time alone?? If you could just get a break away from your family you could relax, enjoy yourself well let me tell you it ain't great..We started blogs so we can communicate with each other while we are apart so rob when you are reading this know you are on my mind. Today was day one of rob leaving while this five day stint is not so bad it is crushing me because in a month and a half he will be gone for a whole year. Is a marriage even functional after being apart for a year?? Let me tell you mine will be,, i do know that much. Well tonight i hung out with a good friend (Jessica) we went to kmart and just hung out ( i did laundry over there) rich checked my car---rob you owe him beer---he said my right front tire was LOW.. the same tire i have had to replace twice in the past three months. i leave tomm. to go drop the boys off wish me luck i return safely.. right now i have them to occupy my time i am going to be HURTING when they are gone the same time rob is..Well good night baby i hope you are doing okay..itll be over soon..i long to have a regular marriage. the kind where you never have to part for six months or (gasp) more.where you don't keep having to learn each other i want to grow up with my husband not learn how much he has grown while we have been apart. military life is not for everyone---right now i feel it is not for me... it is so hard to keep a marriage alive and healthy when you are always parting ways..well i have manage to work myself up and start crying..again..will i stop??i don't think i have stopped crying since i started on thursday.good night my rob-bear. i love you. and while you might be getting wet from the rain i am sending lots of love your way.. i miss you
