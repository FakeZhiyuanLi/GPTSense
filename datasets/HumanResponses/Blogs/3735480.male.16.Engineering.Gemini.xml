      * Warning, I am not talking about eggs here!but something just as delicate ."Alex is back from his one-day break from monday because of paper route! i do not make much sence when im tired, sorry homies/ettes. Well, today i decided to choose a topic that everyone knows, trying to be perfect. We all try to do everything at once so we can win at everything we do, we all try to find the perfect person, we all try to look for the perfect lottery ticket, and we all try to figure out what the perfect flavor of icecream is. Yes, we all try to scramble... to struggle and frantically force ourselves to be the person we aren't. To hike, climb and use all of our energy to get somewhere that is near impossible to get to. But what we should actually do is poach, for we should break our barrier of fear, look inside ourselves and cook up something truly amazing!Not to many people know how to create this delicacy of being ourselves, probably because we become stuck in a bad habit of making the scrambled perfect. Yes with only one teaspoon of understanding, and a couple dashes of self confidence, we can become perfect!by being  ourselves  We all are a true delicacy because all of us are different. We all try to be the same, the same perfect, and yet we all seem to have individual personalities, unique gifts like moving our ears, noses, and knowing how to frown. Poach is to begin and not complete, to never stop learning and feeling and doing, and thats what we should really brew up in our minds, a true delicacy, because we are all perfect, in our own little way.

       *DEEP Hello my frisky freak show weirdo's and welcome to Alex's domain of obliqueness. I apologize earlier for putting my name then saying ruler earlier, for I am no more than a broken ruler. Rulers line things measure everyone up, and if they don't meet their exact requirements, then they just throw them away into the trash. Broken rulers however, they still line things up, but they have no need for measuring whoever they want, they line them up whoever they are. Today's topic may not seem of much importance to rich people, since they don't understand it,  but the poor people know exactly what IM talking about, that's right  nothing ! Nothing is neither the right or lefts ally, but merely the person who balances them both together, where he reigns  "In the state of Nowhere"  Just like when people say "Are you sure you went to the icecream parlor, are you sure you didn't go...Nowhere?" Because that's where people go sometimes to fight out their problems in practical ways, or create something in their imagination, their own little world. The truth is folks and folkettes,  There is no spoon!  in the place of nowhere! There is the  Unlimited  and beyond, and you control all that you see and hear. Sounds absolutely breathtaking! Don't you love it when your talking to somebody and then you and your brain take a little walk in imagiworld and then wake up and no one noticed that you left? You still heard everything the person said, but you create your own image of how you interpreted it and take it a little further than a space monkey? Or when you concentrate on your studies and then go somewhere totally off topic? I  Love it  when that happens! Its like getting high without using any hallucinogen's, (not like I've tried any but the way id interpret it, id think its pretty much the same) Or don't you love it when your dead tired and somebody wakes you up and you say something stupid and fall asleep again, and you find out the next day. Just like ill find out the next day that i wrote this horrible posting!Haha well my countryfolk, see you soon!~Al the not so broken... broken ruler

      Whats happening ya'll this is the Yo Al and you've guessed it, "Graduations over!! Party time and whatever"~most of graduates. Yes, graduation of the grade 12's of 2004 has finally ended with our final support of yet to come for those lucky graduates. Let them be remembered as our friends, brothers and sisters and lucky contestants for the board game "Life" (literaly). I know that all of them might not see most of their friends ever again, and they have to start thinking of full-time jobs like doctors, members of S.W.A.T, firemen, and of course the very popular, hobos, but in the end of all that hardwork, you'll have the beginning of making all your happiness and dreams come true. Your dreams like building a bombshelter underground full of life long preservable rations like beef jerky, powdered milk, barrels upon barrels of water, and raisins that only your great great grand kids can use in the future, or start playing a guitar where all of a sudden a crowd appears in front of you and no matter how bad you are they are cheering you on, or hamsters and the like find out a way to become intellectually and technogically smarter than we are and take over the world, or your most favorite stuffed animals turn alive and having awesome conversations with you...yep i can't wait for those valuable moments to come. Destinations, vacations, going somewhere thats really cool, travelling around all nations. Speeding down a highway, with the top down of your sports car, kick all this into motion! Oh i can't  Wait!  Leave to a place where the sun always shines the winter is never cold and beauty is at your fingertips for the rest of your life and always you have time to spend for everything you want to do with everybody! Ahh this  is  the life!! All you have to do is never give up and strive for the best without hurting everyone else to do it. Just think of all the possibilities! Look into the eyes of fate and beat him at his own game! Make your own fate and   believe that you can do it  ! Oh my goodness gracious cheescake milkshake!Im getting cardiac arrest just thinking of all this lovliness. Time is my precious and i will not loose my grip to the onslaught of failure. The question is...will  YOU! of course you won't! Because all of us lefties and righties will band together to create the paradise of an eternitime. Will you join me?!?! If you won't will you join the environments side and keep the world safe for your children and forechildren and whoeverchildren so that you know that all of us will be safe? Well i am signing off and i wish you all a wonderful life full of dreams and you make them come true! Bye ya'all! ~Al the ruler

      Hello my weirdest of the weird, today is a friday, and as i write the day becomes a saturday so this blog posting is actually worth two days so i tricked myself!! As i tire, i think, "im never giving up! everyday i write a posting and it must take effort!" Effort is something not to be taking advantage of! The way you work at things to make yourself become stronger, faster, smarter, wiser, and charismaticer is something you need to take effort on! Achievement is at the end of the tunnel, not light on this circumstance. Effort is when you tell yourself "screw you and your laziness right brain, talk is cheep and i had enough of your  wrong hot air." You have to start making a treatie with your right and say to it to only work on weekends, because the week never ends when Alex is around! It is a constant battle against what your effort is striving for. Efforts pain and suffering makes you build up and create protection against the nastiest of the nasty, the procrastinator! When you leave everything to the last minute it creates a nonstopping worry of handing things in on time, being late for everything that you strive for, or not make it at all! Let that go and do everything before you have recreation and fun, because the fun becomes funner when you dont have to worry about crap that has nothing to do with what you are doing. When you start thinking "Oh i have sooo much stuff to do....and i have a month to do it soillleaveittillthelastminuteeatmorebars" then the effort fails and it backfires on your already stressful days. Its just like the time when i had my first final in math which was really tough and before that i had suicide wings, hot peppers, and habernero sauce for an appetizer and then i had some real spicy pizza at Houston pizza (where this really hot waitress talks to me everytime i go there.very very lucky me!) and then it went down the right(wrong) way and ...well it felt terrible afterwards! its like swallowing acid and it just goes right through you! OH MAN!  Effort is tough, but when you give yourself something that you dont need at that moment, your just asking for trouble. Effort can be thrown away, but why would you want to do such a horrible thing? In the end, Effort can and will save your life, I guarantee it. Thank you all yet again for you reading and listening to my weird ways. So heed my warnings, dont have so much hot stuff all at once, beware of the procrastinator, and watch for the odd one. See ya! Im here  all summer   ~Yo al

       CAUTION!!!DEEP!!! Hello again! It is a beautiful day!!  , and a most amazing one i might add, my superexcellent weirdo's. Today was a day where being bored was just an excuse for lying around all day and relaxing, because of the very cold wind in the morning, but afterwards it became very windy and just cold. A day where people can say, "Oh school is over..................im bored................................................... iwanttogobacktoschoolbecauseihavenothingtodothewholesummerilljustgogetsomebeefjerky." But the truth is, boredom can only attack the people who want to be bored. Thats right folks, people  want to be bored . Lets just cut down that word, bore-d, bore that means a drilling tool, and d that is the main symbol for dextrorotatory, which means going clockwise, which means turning, or causing to turn to the right hand, which is  wrong!  Bored means that you are just momentarily drilling into your mind to let your right do the talking, that is a major no no weirdos! Bored is where a candle lights itself on fire and watches itself melt, thats not a good thing! A good thing is going outside, having a great time with what time you have, but time does not mean clockwise, it means something that is given to you. Time means left! It means it has a freedom of choice, where it can go really fast when you don't know it, or really slow when you don't want it to, or visa versa. You have to get on times left side, or you just might end up like a lazy couch potatoe. Im not saying its really terrible to be a lazy couch potatoe, because there's always one of those days...or weeks, but i am saying that you got to put that lazy-couch-potatoeness into good use! Become what you must, when you must, or when you want to must,(to be compelled, as by a physical necessity or requirement). All that im truly saying is that you truly have a freedom of choice to give up your left control to your right, and that what being bored is all about. Never give up, and you'll never be bored. I hope this state of deepness pleases you all and i also hope that you comment and tell me what a next question should be answered leftly, or alexly. Peace out my homie g dogs and cats~ Alex the true weirdo!

      Hello my fellow weirdos, and welcome to Alex's home of interestingly unique postings made by yours truly, describing my thoughts and emotions and comparing to the way things are said otherwise. *CAUTION*I have to warn you though, that this entire blog may reduce your IQ to a dangerous level...This is a blog where there is no right or wrong post, only left. Left is a different difficult perspective that trys hard to tie into the right world, and it is the left that will have a say for once.  Is there a point to all this nonsence you ask ? Well maybe you will know the answer, but im just going to have to say im gonna have someMy question for the day is what is mad? lets start off with one of the definitions. often people refer to mad as,a strong distasteful emotion stressing the mind that causes people to let out rage, fury, or a lot of gas. This usually occurs when something displeasureful occurs in the membrane, and when it all builds up, it turns into a hateful, unwanted emotion. What i think about this is that being mad has alot more negative consequences than positive and i think it is almost a major waste of time. The causes vary, but then again, so are the different shapes of snowflakes, but all we recognize is the snowflakes, same with being mad. People sometimes love being mad just to get alot of attension, while people love the snowflakes, but sooner or later you become cold and literaly sick of all those snowflakes, and theres only one reason reason to go in the warmth,and thats to get away from all those snowflakes. Thats why making up is such a good thing, like how the sun and moon after so long are away from each other, then all of a sudden they make up when a solar eclipse happens, it looks amazing! thats why i dont even know how to  frown and Thats why i think we are better off not ever being mad, and instead of breaking up,  make up . Thats my somewhat answered question for today, and if anyone reads this...please do not hesitate to respond, i need to know if this was a good waste of time or a bad waste of time, or a left waste of time. Thank you all and to all an awesome summer ~Alex the lefty weirdo!

      * My friends and weirdos of all sorts!  The Way Things Work website had major problems on my computer for a big walloping while, and I never got a chance to update this baby! Haha maybe i should stop blaming things on everything but me! The truth is, i couldn't think of anything good to write!But here I am, back at last! Todays theme pretty much means picking yourself up when the times get rough. To stand up for yourself and be somebody, be somebody like...not me! Its kind of like trying to eat more when your full. When you've had enough of people pushing you down all the time, that doesn't mean you should stop picking yourself up! You should turn the tides and make your insulters have a dunk of salt water. Of course when your in a situation where you keep getting knocked down consecutively, you go into another room, give them a ten minute time out, and come back!(That also gives you time to think of saying something back.:P) Or you have another option,  stop... drop... and roll ! to make an awkward silence and stop the people from going on fire! Yesarnold, be the fast rabbit who can think of something quick, and be the turtle who can take more hits than Ozzy Osbourne and the people in the 60's combined! (or was it 70's?) Well my folks, I have run out of things to say, and I don't think i can top what I just said today... so peace out, chill out, and see you out...the door of alex's realm of weirdness. Oh and remember... when your feet are in the air and your head on the ground, try a trick and spin it!

      *If you have commented on the last two, then i recommend you do not read my first paragraph full of nonsence, skip to the next.  hopefully better than the last two   HELLO ALL! Im sorry about the last two blogs for they seem a little intensified and cooled down at the same time, but how am i supposed to recognize my wrong-doings if there are no comments? People you read these blogs, but i see no comments happening! Did you know comments are about what other people think about the blog?It doesn't matter if it sucks, or its good as long as i know you guys/gals are reading my blogs! I have taught you the ways of the left and right, where this place is left!It is neither right or wrong, so the good and bad comments are welcome. I am like a comb, I help straighten you out, but only in the way you want me to straighten you out, so tell me what you think so i can reform these posts from what you think of. Remember:These are my thoughts about what I think, and i want to hear what you think as well! Whats the point of freedom of speech if nobody uses it properly?  I am doing this for your benefits, not mine, I WANT YOU! TO COMMENT ON MY BLOGS! hows that for a hot burning speech with cold words? Besides, theres gotta be crappy postings in order to have good ones. So tell me which ones are the crap too.          Hot and cold, Hot and cold. Don't you love the hot and cold. Sought for not, Bold as old, stack up the pot from what you sold, hot and cold. Yes, hot and/or cold, you can choose both, either one, or one from each :P. Many terms are used by these words, for instance: hot is getting close to a conclusion of a solution, like Sherlock Holmes saying "Im hot hot hot on the case!" or having anger like saying "heat!", or having the  hots  for someone. Cold is like saying something harsh, or saying someones as cool as a smooth...ie, or the song hey ya at the two minutes and eighteen seconds part. Together though, together they may yet be really awesome, or really bad who knows. Like for instance, hot and cold could be like a cream puff, where its pretty warm on the outside compared to the freezing inside!BRRR, *Sneeze* That kinda reminds me of a hot fudge sundae...mmm i love those! I guess hot and cold is better than for worse, but there could be other hot and cold combinations that are more *Cold* than anything else. Like Iced tea or hot cold-hearted chicks.... Well look at the time I'd better be off! Oh and don't forget, you can be hot, you can be cold, but if you want to be both, make it a left combination!~Al the try-to-hard blunderous frienfracken

      Hello my friendly fancy pants and I welcome you all to my homeland of weirdness! Today was the day where I hit that sudden growth spurt that everyone dreads, (or muscle spasms or something) and today I became the most awkwardly stumbling blundering person you would ever set your eyes on! I mean I was falling over everything, from fences to sprinklers to mailboxes, (yes I fell  over the mailboxes, and I broke pretty much everything metal that was ten feet close to me. The worst was the sprinklers though. Imagine this...I woke up, picked up my papers for paper route, and started to walk to the first route. Suddenly, I tripped over the sprinkler, fell onto the grass, and somehow my foot got caught in the sprinkler! Of course the sprinkler broke so water was flying everywhere, and I'm completely soaked. To make matters a little more worse, a grandma was watching the whole time laughing at me in a evil cackling way. So here I am, soaked like a drowned grey flamingo and all I could think of was "why why why did I not listen to myself about preparing for the worst..." Then the grandma tells me  "If I was that clumsy, I would never leave the house!"  If that isn't rude, I don't know what is. After I thought about it, I could have interpreted it as one of the most terrible things anyone can say, because being clumsy is saying every single insult in one word. Just look it up in the thesaurus, it says helpless, incompetent, unskillful, inexperienced, ham-handed, elephantine! Like who would ever want to be called clumsy? Its saying that your fat, stupid, non-skillful, ugly, rude, and a vulgar clodhopper (whatever that means)at the same time! If it were my choice, I'd arrest people who would call people clumsy because they have no right to say that! Well my folks I hope you understand why you should never say clumsy ever and I hope that grandma is reading this. See y'all soon y'all ~Al

      Hello again my people! Ahh, finally I got back to my blog, four days since I've been here because of paper route I get really tired after all those papers I have to throw around, complainers to listen to, and things that I didn't do wrong but the company did wrong, well I guess I should have prepared for the worst everyday. Preparing for the worst! Not the best! This is one of the great things anyone can do. Preparing for the worst means being a little more cautious in your everyday life. It means to lock your doors when you leave everyday, it means to bring suntan lotion and bug spray every time you go to the beach, it means bringing over a good classic movie that everyone loves just in case the new movie you rented sucks, and it also means to count every paper just in case your missing one in your new paper route job. All of these are just a small list compared to how prepared you can be. I'm not saying to be super prepared everyday or not be prepared at all, just be prepared for the worst, just in case. Now being prepared for the best is not a bad thing, its a Horrible Thing!! Because you'll never be surprised, you won't ever be happy with what you've got! (because if you don't get the best then you will be miserable all the time), and your parties will be ruined because you wanted them a certain way. I'm also saying that you must make a certain equilibrium with the best and the worst, because you can make sure that nothing goes wrong, but you can't expect that everything goes perfect either. If you do not understand what i just wrote, then understand this, "be happy with what you've got, and strive for more at the same time" And if you don't understand that, well then im glad that you even read this far if none of this makes sence. I hope this blog pleases you all, comment and remember, if worst comes to worst, prepare for the worst!

      Hey everyone! This is your broken, weird, unfrownable ruler speaking. Today is my seventh posting and its only the start of summer! Oh man I feel proud of myself. And you should be proud of yourselves because you read these postings and try to understand the complete nonsense, sometimes if you really think hard they make sense but some of these posts are really hard to understand. Even I sometimes don't even know what IM talking about, but I guess you have to respect my effort.        Ahh yes, respect.  Respect is something not guaranteed in your life warranty, its something to be  earned and cherished.  It is something to route for in all daily activities to all things and people. Respect means the state of being regarded with honor or esteem. It also means a courteous regard for others feelings, and that has a lot of meaning to it as well. All animals, insects, plants and humans have emotions, and they all need to be respected. For instance, mosquitoes are intolerable little nuisance's that all build up and ruin peoples days. They give you little pain if you don't scratch them, but lots of itching and resentment later if you do. But, they still need to be respected, because that's the way they live out their lives by giving little pain to others in order to survive in the real world. Sometimes people can act like little mosquitoes, and if you keep scratching your wounds, then it will keep on itching, but they still need to be respected. If you want respect, you got it from me unless you do something incredibly stupid haha. Well you guys/gals have an awesome weekend, peaceouthomiegdogsilikechristmascandles. ~Al
