      haha i'm soooo out of inspiration right now... all my brain has processed lately is recipes, japanese food names and descriptions, and a little shopping over sunday. But today, it was all made better with the best sandwich I've had in the longest time! An organic sandwich at that heheh... replete with alfalfa sprouts (just a little!) lined with hummus, and bombed with these great lamb kofta balls. Huwa. I finished everything on my plate, and I want some more. :D  I never want to lose my appetite for food. It is the greatest comfort, no matter how stressed. People who don't stop for food because of deadlines? Not me! Eat first, be happy, then go back to work!  As the motto goes, fat together friends forever!

      Baby wennie I wish i had shared this weekend with you once again.   Cycling biking through parking lots   breasts and all I nearly flashed those that patron redondo beach. my bikini top untied my shirt flying off my head  opps oops gracie gracie i flashed those over there and those over here.  hahaha oh how beautiful it was to cycle in the sun in short and a bikini with the breexe whipping my face and my skin smittened with the sun  All i did this weekend was all i probably wanted to do a massage for an hour in a frooffy place and cycling the evenings away  I am drunk again  haha i did the dumbest thing  it was rika's birthday on friday and we had dinner together on sunday. the food was good! my appertite comes when i cycle into ocean breezes and sunsets there was this piece of cake that was walking by with a candle in it i was half way through my wine and i was like guys start singing and everyone started singing  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! HAPPRY Birthday TO YOu but alas the cake went right by our table onto another the waitress had to stop cause it was so  funny that i assumed it was ours and the whole place just laughed and laughed and i was just under the table laughing HOWW fucking embarrassing  I inevitably got rika a cake cause it was highly necessary for everyone to get it  since i made them all sing to a candle that wasn't ours oh how everyone sang  including those in the back of the restaurant when our cake finally came!  hahaha fucking hell THANK GOD I HAD the excuse of being a fucking drunkard shit!!!!!  TOday when i was getting a m assage I had to get naked completely naked  it was so nice so sick cause i missed it so much but it was so nice to have someone touch my back in a dim lit room  and rub me down for an hour granted all i wanted to do  was scream HARDER HARDER cause after all i was used to Kakak's indonesian style torture but this was nice it was more sensual  It made me feel lonely it made me feel yucky  and unfulfilled because it felt so good to be touched it feels like i haven't been touched  for ages. It is sad but it is true. I miss affection terribly.  I am not sad I am just...just  singing lets ride ide ide ah aha big pimping up in nyc jay z style.  its good to be happy  even though it feels  physically empty.  it is enough that i can get 400 ringgit massages sporadically and enjoy the sun in a bikini whenever.  i take a deep breathe in deep breathe out  it is true others are probably  happier and i just have to understand that if it isn't supposed to be me then it isn't. so with that i say  big pimping sending cheese.  it was surreal riding down the bike bath looking at the sail boats that littered the ocean bed and see the sun glaring down at everyone. it was surreal like it was when i was riding the subway on days when i hardly slept.  its alright with me cause you make me feel  so brand new and i want to spend my life with you since  baby since we've been together loving you forever is what i need let me be the one you come running to i never be untrue leetssssssssssss lets stay together. -al green.  yes i have to admit it would be perfect if i could hold a hand  when i amd happily drunk and snuggle. but it is not what is meant for me i will try and sing my days instead and be happy. and i will be. cause i have to be.

      Ohhh baby i am fucking drunk  me and my dear brother went out for dinner we had wine well lots of it it didn't seem to affect him but haha me me me well lets say we started talking about the family and i was laughing and hitting the table and pissing our waitress with my demands  It was therapy it was fucking therapy for the both of us  it was brilliant we sorted out my life in a sitting  the book that has made me realise the possibilities of my life is aptly called princess.  we have sorted it out to perfection if not more.  we know the plan we are keeping to it  trust fund and all motherfucking money assholic parties and all. we are set.  I have voiced my disdain in men and curiously submitted to giving white men a chance.  I have come to realise that i am insured as lucky  even if i am not getting fucked when i want to by who i want to.  after deleting my insecurites i have come to realise those of others more clearly  its a wonder  everytime i was out with chris some dude on the street would always holler to this brother about the keeper he had on his side little did they know there wasn't going to be anyone to keep.  beauty scares i didn't reaslise now i do  and now i will proudly strut the paths of my life even if  i am miserable doing it alone i will do it cause i will be driving a fucking fast car with  jimmy choos.  life awaits even those who were fucked up by assholes as a child and many more through choice in adulthood.  people are dissappointing but you can always count on yourself

      BRain Wash COded Pink:  wennie wennie wennie oh what a glorious day  I awoke with a slate so clean that my brain felt washed  If something makes me insecure I think we all should just huddle back the base line and slowly sneak away   my references to things are becoming dry huh  Today i am filled with dreams and an all fruit diet cause i am feeling sympathetic towards creatures living and dead.  Today  I am filled with the awesome possibility of living and i really don't care where i live  What a glorious one year vacation only spoilt by my personal insecurities and ok random forces out of my control but fuck that it is in the past What is in the future is a headstrong bitch well the same one we all love and adore  I hate being all smittened it makes me lose all sense of self value for some reason What to do la!! i am a stinking good focused bitch la will do anything and everything for my pleasure even if it causes displeasure.  but alas that is  all in the past I am going to travel I can't wait to get the fuck out of here and travel  whether it be mentally or physically.  even if i get hooked into a job,  i don't think i will stay long who would want to? when you can live without one right so fuck that  If all my judgement  on persons were so terribly miscontrued then i really should deserve to only be served prolifically with one night stands I mean lets be honest how terribly afraid of relationships am i? supposedly according to those i have lived with very scared? haha whatever i don't know what i do know is that i am no so gung ho on it anymore  it fucks me up. I think being a free spirit could help  and if i meet someone who would want to spoil and kiss me then i might permit it as long as I am not the one constantly saying so when are we going to fuck? when the second course is being served.  boys are stupid whats worse is that i tend to like the stupidest of the lot  hahaha well maybe not i don't know.  but what i do know is that chris's dad is in the writers guild with salman rushdie and paul auster and he is a writer Everyone i know who is remotely successful seems to have their connections with the people you want to be connected with..their family. and unfortunately for me, or fortunately i don't know i am one that can't seem to be able to use this connection  but alas we know i am going to be fa mous  if not hanging off my diplomat husbands arm sitting in Haiti trying to figure out how to peacefully put a motherfucker militant  into a hole he built for his dissidents.  fuck the UN peace keepers they are pussies lets start a new hire only  army to deal with motherfuckers  the only way they are able to be  dealt with.  now to work towards  it. and somehow figure out how to raise motherfucking genius kids. ii think  i am in love with the right person now me.

      FAIRY TALES: ( I have no cavities in all my 25 years and going, knock on wood) there is a particular tooth in your mouth that aches when you get turned on. really. trust me you just don't realise it.  if you have a good set of teeth, and aren't too prone to drinking ice cold beverages on days where  the sun has yet to touch 85 degrees, ( this would mean you are insensitive to any change in tooth feeling really, so you might as well stop reading now.)  if you play close attention to your mouth and your 'feelings' well below your mouth you'd realise that your tooth would start to ache before  any other feeling of possible forgetful euphoria should to ever kick in.  It is what i call the devils bite. this odd dull, incongruous pain.  the nerve is possibly connected to your clit, i can't say penis, cause i don't have one.  possibly after a couple  chunks of milk chocolate, a cigarrette and some water you'd be aware of this need to be  smoothered by a rapturous kiss. something that would look  so fucking disgusting and ridiculous on film but would really truthfully feel like you are taking the biggest bite of the best chocolate or vanilla pudding in the world. you would realise that your tooth is aching for something sweet of the different kind just as the thought passes your imagination.  LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION: this tooth i would like to call the horrid angelic-honeybee tooth is located on the right side of your upper molar collection second from the last, before the wisdoms. honey bee cause it stings ever so slightly.  MESSY: I have to say the funniest thing  that has ever tickled me ever ( and frustrated me to tears) was faking an orgasm for the 15th time when a certain someone was going down on me. It just became so hilarious that this almost 30 year old male man couldn't eat pussy properly. I used to have to do all this moaning and groaning just so i wouldn't have to  put up with his sour fucking face and stupid boyish tantrums about his socks being too tight or his publisher was throwing a tantrum about his next book. how do you tell a man who says..sshh i know what i am doing young lady :P   how do you shout and demand that he isn't while you are spread eagle close to tears cause you are so bored and in such a position and not feeling remotely sexy. you can't. so instead you don't sleep with him cause if he can't eat properly chances are he can't do much  or even if he can, why risk the possible dissappointment. man, the easiest men to get over are those stupid man that think they are the shit and really all the while it was just you faking it cause you didn't want a fucking drama post fake orgasm. but seriously, how can you not tell if a woman comes or not! you can!   hhmmm, but he got that far harpreet?: well what my excuse well i guess i don't know i was going through my life experimenting la. in all my years of fucking which really amounts to  almost no years at all the best time that i ever had was on  my floor slightly doped up post japanese anime watching  with james clar. this slightly shorter then me man, was the most attentive motherfucking stranger i have ever been with. haha, thank god you went  to the china club that night jw, if you didn't there would have been a  hell lot of weird ass silence  and shuffling coming from my room.  NOISES: see it isn't  about the moaning and groaning half the time and if it is you wouldn't remember it. and if you remember it its cause it felt like you were reheasing for the christmas choir for the hundreth time and its a pain.  on being me: i hate being me cause i get am such a volatile and sensitive creature when i am insecure. and when i am that i just feel like hoping on a plane and dissappearing. its far easier to do then face any form of insecurities.

      oh god i have to tell you about my dream last night  i was on the 5th floor of this apartment building and it faced the sea front.  but the apartment was in a glass bubble. then suddenly there was this warning that there was a tsunami coming  i was sitting outside on the balcony with this mexican or puerto rican woman who had a son but the son was inside the apartment. suddenly we saw this huge shark and i turned to ask the lady next to me how come the shark is so big but then the lady was now my father and he said it is all relative, when the waters get deeper the sharks and all that lives in it gets bigger, like a fish in a tank as opposed to a glass bowl.  haha, so now this shark hits the glass and cracks it  and we run inside seeing the sea swell we need to get out of the apartment desperately i grab the boy  and try and put on some shoes but i can't find my waterproof shoes so i settle for cowboy boots that aren't mine hahaha  we get into the elevator and i accidently pressed gold instead of G for groundfloor and we end up going up we end up on the 13 floor and we are stuck watching the glass crack further and the waves become bigger.  sigh dumb ass huh.

      Eros.  The Greek Legend: God of Fertility Son of Iris and Zephyrus said to be an attendant to Aphrodite and not his son Offspring of Aphrodite and Ares Ares- the Greek God of War, who is handsome, tall, but vain and cruel. Etymology: Man, Male, Strife Aphrodite is the Goddess of love, beauty and sexual rapture. Etymology: Foam-Born Born from Erebus and Nyx( night) Anteros, said to be the brother of Ero's, he languished in loneliness, until Aphrodite gave Anteros to Eros. Anteros is the god that punishes those who scorn love and do not return love of others. The young greek boy, winged , armed with a bow and arrows. much like the modern day image of Cupid. Eros, struck with his arrows on Gods or mortals  of which would rouse them to desire. The golden arrows with Dove feathers  aroused love or the Leaden arrows with owl feathers that causes them  indifference.  Aphrodite was his mother...Psyche, a beautiful mortal.  The Roman's borrowed Eros from the Greeks and Renamed him in  Latin... Cupido , meaning desire.  Aphrodite , the Goddess, was very jealous of Psyche,  the immortal. Aphrodite sent Ero's her son, to make Psyche fall in love with an ugly man. Seeing her Ero's feel in love with Psyche and visited her every night, but forbade her to see his face. They spent their nights together in darkness, till one day, Psyche, picked up an oil lamp and glanced at his face, he awoke by the heat of the drop of oil that spilt on him and leaped out of the room. Psyche roamed the lands in search of Ero's till eventually, Zeus felt sorry for her and reunited them.  The english definition of Psyche: etymology: breath, soul  The Light of Dark. If Psyche feel in love with Ero's before she even saw him. It seems almost like he could have very well been the ugly man that Aphrodite asked His son to  ensure that she feel for him.   Sanskrit has 96 words for love. Persian 80 Greek 3 and English 1   The Philosophy of Love: Love is an umbrella that houses 3 complex elements that make it whole. Eros, Philia, and Agape.

      This is one of my favourites from his translated book of poems - Fables of Dawn.   ***   If You So Wish  If you so wish there is a blue sky with a different kind of blueness there are white clouds with a different kind of whiteness there is another way of gazing at the full moon a purple sun in the fifth season morning with a different kind of shine night with a thicker darkness  Close your eyes for a moment here we live without calendar recall the first tears mixed with laughter how sweet, how bitter when we uttered the first words  I'll send you a butterfly from a place that never receives any light and a handful of blue chalk from a cavern dug with nails and song  I'll indeed send you if you so wish a boat without number and time get on it, friends without parents there is a blue island with a different kind of blueness  ***  I am awed by the breadth of his imagination every time I read it. If even the lorry garbage collector wrote this for me, I'd marry him the next day! :)

      velvet speed a current of cool black tar under my belly we're on the road  ***  There's been an accident red sequins climb the hill ahead slowly  ***  There's something about travelling late late at night in a fast, well-suspended car, with my father driving, leaving packs of cars behind. Everyone is quiet, and we watch the kilometres measured in milestones pass, and judge the speed by the blurring lines on the road. I wrote these on my motorola, sms-ed to some bemused friends. Still like these lines.

      hi you. i guess this is my solution to dangling my legs over the sofa at night and hanging out waiting for bloody clients in the office. writing to my lonesome. and you. and random clicking strangers :) eh that template you hate so much is as easy as choose-click-click. this is much cooler i think. this may just become a book, if i can think of a proper binding story. how about we start one with aunty mangorain? sigh. i know, i know. our writing is so different. i'm much more sleeping like a cheetah in the afternoon in the sahara, and you are a white bengal tiger running amok in california. and aunty mango is a gypsy visionary with curry spices. i wish you'd start a personal blog. i don't want to go through jacq, zab et. al's blogs to get to yours. come la.

       There is, in Costa Rica, a species of small palm tree with elevated roots that walks through the forest, literally, in search of sunlight. Silently, doggedly, on a knightly quest for sustenance. Think of its spiky leaves and gnarled trunk composed of outcroppings, leaves long ago discarded, lifting its legs as the sun arcs hidden across the sky, above the canopy of trees.  Frogs dance to the beat of water. Innately sensing bodies of water, they traverse the most incongruous of landscapes. Once a frog leapt out of the drainage hole in the balcony of my fourth-floor apartment. Having left its digs which must have proved boring—after all it was just a straight pole down to the roof below—it crossed the cool marble floor of the living room to the main door. I let it out. It probably smelt the pool in the courtyard. Maybe their hearts beat to the reverb of ripples, follow the patterns of tides.

      When i pick yellow crystals of pus from my eczema-ridden leg, i test them for their hardness and clarity. All of us rich in our own various ways.

       My fingers ache to the bone to swirl a brush in water, transfer paint to rough surfaces, travel oil across ready swathes of paper. My heart cries to birth new visions. I plan on minute post-it notes big, big projects, inked out in all the variety blue, red and black Artline 0.4s offer, but they all end up in my right-hand drawer, behind the chocolates and CDs. And i watch television at night, and sleep with raging heart.
