       definitely worth watching    unbreakable -  watched this again.&nbsp; m night shyamalan does good.&nbsp; Good story, strong performances, genius camera angles all the way through.   the wonderboys -  great story!!!&nbsp; Definitely go for this, michael douglas is very good   the negotiator - &nbsp; 2 top class actors (spacey and jackson) and a good script make this brilliant   runaway jury - &nbsp;john grisham thriller.&nbsp; Great plot twists.&nbsp; And some genuine moral scenes in there (which gives a nice feelgood factor)&nbsp; weisz, hoffman and cusack all brilliant   confidence  - another top film with&nbsp;rachel weisz (she'll be around for a long time), the cast are excellent and there are more twists in there than a large intestine   farenheit 9/11  - dunno if u can call it "good" but it made me laugh, cry and leave the cinema wanting to get involved in politics (which is unheard of)     &nbsp;  some redeeming moments    25th hour -  edward norton makes this just worthwhile - leaves u a little unsatisfied tho   spun&nbsp;-  some sick/dodgy scenes which spoil it but some of the camera shots are beautiful and it seems like it could be a fairly accurate represenation of the drug   matchstick men -  odd.&nbsp; But interesting.   thirteen -  sounds like it might be rubbish, but it comes across as a reasonably accurate portrayal of the pains and joys of being a teenager.&nbsp; Holly Hunter is excellent as the single parent desperately trying to be a good mum throughout.   &nbsp;  don't waste your time    the astronaut's wife -  with johnny depp&nbsp;& charlize theron it had potential...but sadly it sucks   van helsing - &nbsp; no no no no no no no no no no no!!!   can't think of any more at present but i hope it helps u to make wise rental choices!

      got slightly vexed @ a new project wiht the strapline "a winning way to help local charities" called Manchester Lottery.  Basically the money it makes goes to 3 charities (christies against cancer, community foundation for greater manchester, manchesterkids)  But it sounds like it's blatantly marketed @ teenagers - it works by using&nbsp;SMS text messages.&nbsp; I just see it having the contrary result of creating more problems for young people - gambling addiction, encouraging being foolhardy with money etc  hmmm...anyway you can check it out on  urlLink www.manchesterlottery.com    i wrote a lengthy response to community foundation, i think they're the brains behind it.

      another (particularly) boring day at work today.  ...which got me thinking about doing a survey.  Although, it won't really be like a survey, because this bloggersite can't do polls.  Anyway, my top 10 ways of relieving the boredom (alternatively called avoiding doing what i'm supposed to be doing) are as follows (no particular order): 1 try to start a conversation on msn messenger 2 surf the web 3 go and make a drink 4 go and have a "think" 5 use the loo 6 search amazon for my next dvd/book/cd purchase 7 check my email 8 start to do something important only to hit delete after writing 2 sentences 9 ... 10 ...  ...well, that's my point, i've really drained the barrel when it comes to being bored at work and i need some new ideas  please feel free to comment.
