      I don't know why I bother anymore. I'm better off keeping my secrets hidden away in journals and blogs than telling actual people. They tend to just let secrets go to other people, especially the people the secrets are about. Not even bad secrets but just the general fact that people like to fuck with my trust. I'm too much of a pussy to do it to them but lately I've been thinking that I should. I know I wont... but I should. An eye for an eye sounds good.

       It was surprisingly warm at 9am today as I journied from my house to the bus stop two miles up the road. The night before I recalled my mother and I arguing about the dirty little habbit I try to keep from her: smoking cigarettes. I hate lying to her but I don't know how she'd take it if she knew. It was even stranger when I got a phonecall at 7am from my aunt who had knews of my grandmother who suffers from emphysema. She had gone to the hospital with internal bleeding and was scheduled for a blood transfusion. I ignored the little coincidence and carried on. I prepaired myself for the day and headed out. By the time I had reached the bus stop I had about 20 minutes to spare. I strolled over to the nearest gas station and wandered inside. The clerk wasnt at the counter but I didn't think about it. I pulled the change from my pocket and went to the cooler at the back. I slid a Root Beer Jones Soda from the rack and went to the counter. I leaned over and looked at the door to my left behind the counter and a man appeared. He smiled and rang up my purchase, I paid him and left.&nbsp;I walked to my bus stop which was only on the other side of the road and sat myself down against the pole. I pulled out my last cigarette and eyed it before taking one more drink of my soda. I set it down and popped the cigarette between my lips. I looked down at the soda cap in my hand and on the inside of it were the printed words "Stop Smoking."    &nbsp;  Of course, I smoked the cigarette as I wondered what had taken god so long to get the message to me.

       So. Nate stayed the night last night because we were all going out to dinner today. Last night, however, I came home shitfaced after a nice couple of hours with Billy, Buckley, Danny and the infamous Marle. Nate stayed home with my parents and chatted. The worst part about getting shitfaced is one: I can't remember things. Two: I sometimes can't control what I do. Three: I know I'm acting like an ass.&nbsp; Speaking of ass, when I was laying on one of the couches and Nate was on the other I blasted ass. I didn't mean to, but it was like...hardcore ass. Yeah I know it's all unlady-like and what not but COME ON. Everyone does it... sadly. When my brother said something I blamed it on my foot rubbing against the wood on the couch. Yeah. I know I'm smooth. I don't need you to tell me. And another thing, Marle threw a goddamn beer at me. IT WAS FULL TOO! I went and picked it up and threw it back though. I'm glad Nate wasn't angry with me. I was so worried. I didn't mean to get trashed but its like I didn't notice what I was doing. He was just glad that I had a hang over like I should've.

       I have a problem with giving and telling people what they deserve. I shouldn't be so nice all the time, especially to people who've fucked me over before. Remember that lovely Green Day song Nice Guys Finish Last? Yeah. That's me. I'm the nice guy. I especially hate it when I've been pretty damn good to some people and they turn around and somehow get it into their head that I went and fucked them over. Wow.    &nbsp;    " Nice guys finish last     Your running out of gas    Your sympathy will get you left behind    Sometimes you're at your best,    when you look the worst    Do you feel washed up,    like piss going down the drain     &nbsp;  Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane    I'm so fucking happy I could cry    Every joke can have its truth and now the joke's on you    I never knew you were such a funny guy     &nbsp;  Oh nice guys finish last,    when you are the outcast    Don't pat yourself on the back,    you might break your spine     &nbsp;  Living on command    You're shaking lots of hands    Kissing up and bleeding all your trust,    taking what you need     &nbsp;  Bite the hand that feeds     You kill your memory "

        I left town for a couple of days with my family and Nate. It was alright. It was nice to get away but I kept getting the nagging feeling from recent events though they faded away after the first day. Eastern Washington is beautiful. I've never really seen any other desert besides that but I still think it's great. My mom finally found Chief Josephs grave. We went to the first cemetary and looked around. I was chasing grass hoppers when I stumble across a small old grave. I stopped and crouched down to read the tombstone. It had a name but I've forgotten it now. The dates on the grave were something like: October - , 1912 to February - , 1914. She wasn't even two yet. I wondered how she died, or if her parents had another baby. If a couple lose a child so young and then have another, do they eventually forget about the first one they barely knew? Do they still come to the grave? No... They'd be gone by now. No one else knew her except for those people. No one comes to rest flowers on her grave. No one remembers her smiling face. God the mound where she was burried was so small. It's sad to think that someday while I rest everyone who knew me will eventually go on and forget or die off and then no one will come to my grave anymore.

      After I saw that worthless piece of shit I sat for about 15 minutes in the theater with Nate and stared at the screen; the constant 'what the fuck was that?' thought running through my head. I wanted to like it. I really did but it just..turned to crap so fast. No. Not crap. Worse than crap. I'd rather mingle in my own fecal matter than watch that ever again. I mean... The previews made it look so good as to what it really is. ANyway. Amber is here. Freedom is mine.
