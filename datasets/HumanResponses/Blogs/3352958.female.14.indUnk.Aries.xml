      Hey everyone! My grandma and grandpa left today. I have nothing to do today because no more school-ball! Today there was a choir concert presentation for my school at the end of the day it was SO BORING. I fell asleep. No offense if you were in it, but that was SO boring. Except good job to all the solo people you did good I listened to you guys! We also went to the high school for a tour of the school even though I know it by heart almost. I have two tests to study for tonight and I have to watch the Twin's games! Geez! Well nothing else to say you guys. Love yas---kiks

      Hello everyone! I'm in a pretty good mood considering my miserable day. This weekend my southern star team and I trecked to Blue Dirt-hehe and had a tournament w/ 5 games! Yesterday we won all three games and I had good games myself. Today though we lost our first game against Spencer, Iowa by like a lot. The problem though was that it was pouring rain. Not only was it raining but the fields were like swimming pools. I pitched one inning of the second game and struck out one girl which is awesome because the ball was constantly soaked and muddy. I didn't walk anyone either ;)! The second game was jipped though. We ended up getting 3rd place in the tournament which sucks! We played Fairmont last right? Well okay they batted and only scored one run right, okay no prob. HOWEVER! When we were up we had one out runners on 1st and 2nd and the umps called the game because it was raining so hard! So we lost and we didn't even get a chance to have a full at-bat! Not fair! Oh well, we got a medal...and we have a game tomorrow, we'll just have to win that! I'm so excited for school to end! I'm also sad though because it means hanging out with some people less than I would like to. My goal this summer though is and I quote "lose 20 pounds and get an AWESOME tan" that is my goal..you can quote me on it later too...we will see! I'm excited for this weekend. I don't really care that I'm missing the dance. They've been really gay this year. I don't know if it's because of the people at our school or the DJs or maybe they're just planned wrong somehow. The only downer is I can't dance w/ Zanik. For Valleyfair though I'll make it up to him and hang out w/ him there. So that way I don't have to wonder around by myself. I probably would've found someone else to hung out w/ though anyways. It's not that I don't have friends it's just I don't have a BEST friend. Ya know what I mean? A best friend to just hang out w/ and tell EVERYTHING to? Ya that would be cool but whatever I've survived so far without one and life is fun now anyways I'm not bugged. On Friday I realized that I had forgotten my knee brace in my gym locker and I needed it for my softball tournament. So my sis drove me over to the school and there was a janitor at the school (at like six o' clock at night...weird..) so I stood at the door and knocked til he finally came and let me in. I almost hugged him but then I'm like "Kirsten...no..." Well I guess I better be off my grandparents are here for a while so I better go talk w/ them so I don't seem like a snob or whatever! Much love----kiki

I have a southern star softball tournament in Blue Earth-five games total between Saturday and Sunday! JEEPERS! Then a little later I'm going to Tricia's to hang out w/ her and Beth L...maybe Melissa er..I don't know...cuz confirmation is FINALLY over! My lucky brother and two of his friends are going to the Twins game tonight, so not fair! I'm very jealous! I will just be stuck at home...watching them on TV...talking on the phone....tear...jk! I'll get over it, I'll be at their games next weekend anywho! Well gee I guess I don't have anything else to say! I'm outty! Love you all very very much! hehe----Kiki

      Today was a good day for me. I finally got an apology out of someone who was snoopy and I forgave them. It feels nice to forgive someone. I'm mad about it, but I'm forgiving. I'm in such a good mood. I feel so close to a certain person. I just feel so comfortable around him, it just feels "right", ya know? Well anywho!  Tonight is my last confirmation class! YAY! I am very very happy about that! Also some Twins news...Joe Mauer played DH today, he didn't catch but I am very happy! That is a very good sign! Maybe he'll be playing by the time I go to Kansas City so that I can take some snapshots of him...HEHE!!! Today in gym I did absolutely nothing because I can't do the high jump, long jump, and hurdles, ugh what a shame! So Mary and I just sat on those cusiony things by the high jump and talked about people. It was fun. We were trying to get a tan cuz we're both so pale. I like Mary, I didn't know her before, but I really like her, she's a great person. Tomorrow we have our last school-ball game of the year..TEAR...we're gonna go out to eat after our game so we can all hang out. I'm kind of sad that eighth grade is coming to an end. I had SO much fun this year. Many ups and downs but it'll all turn out for the best somehow. I love most of our teachers, they're so awesome. I hate summer because I never see anybody and I don't hang out with them as much. I hope I don't lose anymore friends this summer like I have the last month. Well I'm gonna get going I'll write later everyone--much love----KIKI

      Hey everyone! I just got back from a softball game we beat Austin by quite a few! I played first base the first game and the second game I played outfield...and you know what is ironic? When I was taken out the ball was FINALLY hit out into my neck of the woods...but NOOO I wasn't there. UGH! What a pain! Ben's party was postponed until Friday, but I'm excited!!! Only like ten or so more days of school left but like there's a few less for me because I'm missing next Friday, I'll explain later, and the second to last day before school because of Valleyfair! Today I confronted someone about their being a bit too nosey for my liking, and what did they do? They lied! I almost fell out of my chair laughing though. See what I think is ironic is the poeople that some people don't like (you know who you are) those people are the people that have been really close to me lately and really nice and honestly I consider those two and then a few more to be my best buds at this moment. In the library I sit by Zanik on those little couches and stuff you know and like Mr. Nelson always walks through the library and always wants me to move away from Zanik I just refuse. I know Nelson would never do anything to me. He wouldn't send me to the box and whatnot...Well I have to go take a shower, dry my hair, and all that jazz before Zanik calls love you all! ---Kiki

      This is my first post, but I'll just start writing it normally. This morning we had softball practice for Southern Star. I'm number 8, not number 18 which makes me angry, but OH WELL! I will hopefully play second base a lot. I love playing second and I played it all year last year. I like pitching and all it's just that it hurts when I pitch and it isn't very fun to have so much pressure on you. Tonight Ben is having a party at his house and I'm very excited for that! Even though I am not on best of terms with certain people I just won't talk to them, no big deal. It's so silly being in my fight with my so-called "best friend" because it's being made such a big deal when it really isn't one and to be honest I don't care that we're in a fight, it's not my problem really. Well I better go e-mail this person...

      Yesterday was one of the worse nights ever! It was so incredibly scary for me! I had to pitch---which was just yuck to me, but I knew I had to so I went through with it. I was actually doing pretty good. I had only allowed two runs in and struck out a few people. We also had about six runs added to that. But, from the begining I couldn't really catch my breath I just couldn't stop breathing loudly. After the second inning I went over by my mom and asked her if I could use her inhaler ( I have asthma ). I did but it didn't seem to work and I couldn't get any of it to stay in my mouth. My teeth eventually started to tingle--this had never happened before. It was like my teeth were shivering, it was weird and awkard. But I went back and sat down on the bench. Eventually I had to be walked over to a picnic bench behind the dugout in the shade by Mal. By the time I had sat down I still couldn't catch my breath and now suddenly half my face and my hands "tingled".  People kept coming over trying to get me to take deep breaths but I just couldn't. It seemed impossible. After about ten minutes my whole body felt "tingly" like I kept getting poked with tons of needles. My mom and dad kinda freaked out so they decided to take me to the hospital in St. Peter. I had to walk some distance to get to the car and I had to be supported by my parents cuz I felt so unbalanced and felt like I was gonna fall at like any minute. When I got there they took my blood pressure and listened to my lungs and decided that I wasn't having a asthma attack or anything. They told me I was and did hyperventilate and by hyperventilating, I worked myself into a panic attack so it was good I went to the hopsital. They had me breath in a paper bag ( yes, like in the movies ) and they stuck an IV in me and put something in it to calm me down. I eventually got my breath back probably I would say an hour after I started having troubles and the tingling dissapeared. I got a wheelchair out of the hospital because I was having troubles walking good. When I got out Jenny and AJ were outside making sure I was okay. It was nice to know that they cared about me. I'm okay now and everything. Just shooken up. I can walk good again, too. Somewhere though I feel like I kinda let the team down by just leaving. But if I had stayed there I could've fainted or gone into severe muscle spasms. So I hope they understand I didn't have much of a choice. Well I suppose that's all there's a Twins game on and I'm gonna go watch my Joe Mauer and Lew Ford. Oh by the way Jacque Jones might get traded when Shannon Stewart comes back. Because Lew Ford has been doing a little better than Jones this year. Which is sad cuz I love Jacque to death, but I love Lew WAY more! I even use his swing and it works just dandy too!--Special K

      I am officially resigning from pitching. And if you are on my softball team and are hearing this for the first time I want you to get the whole story. I am not kidding when I said I am through with pitching, cuz I really am. I can't stand it anymore. I've had enough.  My reasons for quitting are these:  1. My knee surgery has been hard on me. I am unable to do what I know I'm capable of doing. I hold back and I'm not as confident. I'm nowhere near as good as I was last year.  2. Only a few of you know what I'm talking about when I say it's so much pressure being out there on the mound. You HAVE to pitch strikes, no duh. Everyone is watching you. I also can't tune people out: Blair, fans, the other team. I just can't seem to do it like I do in hockey.  3.I'm sick of having people judging me when I'm pitching. If I do something wrong, I know it. I'm not the only one who makes mistakes and you ALL know that! I would like to see you guys go out there pitch, then be ready right after the release. Believe it or not, it ISN'T easy!   I also have reasons why I didn't want to quit or didn't quit earlier:  1. I don't want to let the other pitchers down. Especially Jen cuz I know she pitches a lot as it is. I feel bad that I'm giving her and Janine that huge load. Who knows, maybe they'll appreciate it though..??  2. I don't want to let my teammates down. I know that I'm not a great pitcher, but I don't want them to think that I'm a quitter! I'm not, I've just realized that this isn't my thing anymore and I'm sorry if you have a problem with that.  3. You know what position has grown on me? OUTFIELD! I really want to play it. It's not as much of a pressure spot but you still get some action. I know most of you think that's a stupid position, but guess what it'll be important eventually and I think that's a great position for me.   *******I feel bad that I'm quitting because I've been a pitcher for so long. I would like to thank all of you who have been there and helped me. I feel bad, like I've been a complete waste of time for you guys. I do appreciate it though, thanks.

      I'm not a perfect person..there's many things I wish I didn't do...gosh I just LOVE that song! Sorry! tehe! Well anyways I will move on, I had hockey for the first time yesterday. It was nice to finally be back out on the ice...and actually not be the youngest one out there too! It really hurt about that last hour (my knee I mean), but I hope it didn't show! I'm not at my best, so I'm hoping that I'll only get better from here! I have a tournament this weekend in New Ulm..we have to play really early..ugh..although I won't be playing much the first game I'm guessing, that's understandable though. See I chose hockey over softball on Wednesday. I really needed to go to hockey though, cuz usually the first day is the easiest, and if i was totally unable to skate I wanted that day to find out. OH well, I don't think I missed much of a game anyway! Let's see, Zanik's coming over for a few hours tomorrow, we're like deprived of each other! *tear haha well I think I'm going to get going--much love--kiki

      Hey everyone! I guess I haven't written in here for so long! Well I thought I did..guess not! I have so much to talk about. Well let's see I am very proud and excited for myself. Some of you know why, if you don't just ask ;)! Yesterday I went over to Mal's to practice pitching. I really needed the practice of course. I did kinda bad, hope ya didn't mind Mal! LOVE YA! We just hung around while it was raining hoping mostly that we wouldn't have a game for reason I choose not to say. Too bad we had one...oh well it was okay. Most of ya on my team know though! Today I went shopping it was fun! I got a new swimsuit that well it makes me feel comfortable! The bottom is like a miniskirt, but it's a suit! It's SO cute I love it! I got some other stuff too. I just don't feel like explaining EVERYTHING! Now all I need is to tan! I am now deciding to run 1/2 a mile every other day. See I've already done it twice, I run a lap around my circle, then walk a lap for a total of one mile. I know it isn't much, but it's just because I'm out of shape since my surgery I need to get back into shape for hockey. Also it'll help my knee lots! I am also practicing pitching, which I need to do! Oh I got my pictures from the last day of school back today! They're so funny! Like Tara (Hill) is doing her fun pose in like ALL of them, it's so funny! Also some of you know my infamous "Seducing the Camera" pic right? Well Zanik did one for me and I have a picture of it! Oh gosh it's SO funny! He looks so cute! I guess it's more of an inside joke between a few of us (Mal, Mindy, Zanik, and I) but it's funny OK! LAUGH! Oh a few days ago my cat, Blackjack, had a seizure. Ya that was kinda scary, but he's fine now! THANK GOODNESS! Uhhh...well I guess that is all I have to share. Talk to yas later---love you all!

      Tonight I have to go to church for my confirmation summer mentoring thing. I have to go to a council meeting. I don't even know what they do at those!?! Tomorrow Zanik will be coming over and then he's going to my softball game. yay! Yesterday we finally beat the Mankato Peppers. The Peppers are like a team that some girls in Mankato try out for. So they're really good. We beat them in extra innings. International rules say that the person that got the last out in the previous inning gets to start out the game at second base. So I had that wonderful opportunity. I got the winning run and Beth Lecocq was on base behind me and got the insurance run and eventually the run we needed to win. So that was so fun. I played first base the whole game. I'd rather play that anyways because Jen pitched and if she had to stop I was sure I'd be going in and I don't know how I would've done with all that pressure. Not that I dislike pitching, but I think she did better with all the pressure she had on herself. Ya it hasn't even been summer for a week and I'm so bored! I need to find stuff to do! GEEZ...CALL ME! hehe...Well I think I'm going to go...much love-kik

Just kidding--we didn't do anything but cuddle and stuff...nothing really to hide here. Ya yesterday I had a softball tournament we got 3rd place. Which is awesome! Today I didn't do anything. Tomorrow I have a game against the Peppers in Mankato and on Tuesday there's a coucil meeting. I have to go to one of these for Confirmation with my mentor. yayhoo! jk! Nothing really exciting to report. So I think I'm gonna get going here...love yas--kiksta

      A few days ago there was a plan crash in Owatonna that smashed into a house. My surgeon, Doctor Gordon Welke, was in it. He was killed. Right now I am very very sad becuase my Godmother's husband has a brain tumor. So I feel unlucky right now. I mean Dr. Welke was just my surgeon, but it seems so unfair that someone who helps people and isn't that old at all has to die. I'm in kind of a depressed mood things aren't going wonderful for me right now. However I'll keep going on with my life! Yesterday at my softball game I pitched the whole game and we won 8-4! I pitched the WHOLE game that is so exciting for me. Because my knee didn't hurt at all! That ump had a bad strike zone. It bugged me for batting and pitching. Today I went to my Godmother's house and visited them for a while. It was nice. I just got back and I think I am going to go work out and ride bike. Well that's all I'm gonna say for now...much love---GOD BLESS GORDON WELKE AND HIS FAMILY--kiks

      Hello everyone. Before I explain my weekend and stuff I would like to make a correction I wrote about a week or so ago. I wrote that I wish I had a best friend and that I have never had one. I don't feel like I have a best friend right now but deep down I do. It just doesn't seem best friendish this whole ordeal right now. Sorry if any of you got the wrong idea. Well onto, I will first explain my weekend. I went to three Twin's games in Kansas City, Missouri they won 1 out of 3 of them. I had fairly good seats. There really weren't any bad ones. I guess my parents hadn't planned to go to all three. But I honestly never got that impression, but somehow they were tired of my pleading and let us go to the third game too. I feel bad though cuz my mom had planned all these things she wanted to go see. I had a great time though. No matter what baseball NEVER seems to get boring for me. I just love it so much! Today we went to Valleyfair and it was raining all day. I mostly hung out with Zanik but at first we were in big groups that people split up and kept splitting up and stuff. I actually went on Wild thing---yes THREE times in fact. Zanik is really truly scared of rides...I didn't think it was possible for someone to be more scared of rides than me but I guess it's possible! Haha..it's okay I still love you Zanik! I guess this weirdo kid was stalking Jennifer which is freaky. I wish I had seen him up close I would've made sure he would've left her alone. Well I best get going-love you all---kiki!!

       I had softball practice today. It was fun. Me and some other girls had fun saying how bad we were and stuff---I guess you kind of have to know the whole story to understand--if you want to know--ask away! I had a talk with Z yesterday. Things aren't exactly FLY with us but at least he knows how I feel and vice versa. I just realized something. If Doug M. gets traded to the Red Sox there is a good chance that we may be facing him on Saturday or Sunday. Isn't that like CRAZY! See the deadline is three o' clock on Saturday. And the Twins have a three game series against the Boston Red Sox. So if he is traded THERE than we will be whooping his ass as of this weekend. That really tweaks my melon. Anywhos! This weekend I'm headed to Elk River for our state tournament. I'm staying with my grandparents, but leaving EARLY Saturday morning which makes me angered. I would say this should be an interesting tournament there are some problems flying around. So we will just see. Well that's all for now. Love ya guys--kiks

       My Twins won today! :) I am so incredibly happy about that! They swept the White Sox, first time since 2001, but hey we don't need to flaunt that fact. That really helped us tremendously now we have a much better position in first place. We needed to win as many games as possible considering the teams that we'll be playing: Oakland, Red Sox, Angels, Yankees. Doug STILL hasn't been traded---but Justin Morneau still played today--He had an interesting game. He really hit two home runs. BUT the stupid umpires changed their mind TWICE. They just shouldn't do that to young Morneau. Teasing him like that...lol. Hunter got a homerun which made me smile because the crowd has been booing him lately so I just thought---take that and shove it where the sun don't shine CHICAGO! In the first game he tagged up from third on a sac fly and to get home safely he knocked down the Sox's catcher REAL hard. The guys suffered a mild concussion--haha WHOOPS! Thankfully Hunter got home safely! However, the rest of the series the fans gave him a hard time by booing him and whatnot. If I was him and like over twenty-five THOUSAND people were booing ME I would cry--lol. I didn't do much today. Not much TO do. Cept watch the Twins game of course. The last week has kinda blowed but ya whatever! I think I'm going to get going now that's all the Twins jazz I'm gonna share for today if you wanna know the WHOLE story of the win which i know you ALL do go to  urlLink www.twinsbaseball.com  !! I know you wanna! LOL--well I'm outty---kikstas

       The fair is over...thank gosh! But now I'm all alone by myself, I'm sad because Zanik seems to not like me at the moment. He didn't want to hang out with me over fair time and hasn't called me...and frankly I am mad/sad at the same time. Today my brother and I had a water war in our yard...it was fun. Yesterday I had&nbsp;a chat with someone on my softball team. I'm not gonna name anyone specifically, but I'll say for sure that I haven't laughed SO hard for quite a while. Weirdos...Dougy is pretty much gone from the Twins. He doesn't really play anymore and we ALL know why...They don't want him to get hurt cuz that would ruin a deal they're working out to trade him. I'm in a way glad he's going. Sure I'll miss a familiar face that has been there for a while now. But, that's the game. I would say that Justin Morneau is way better offensively, no doubt. He has five homeruns already---that's how many Dougy has had ALL YEAR. He is also a big asset to the team. He hasn't made any major errors or anything at first. So I'd say that's the best way to go. So bye Dougy---twas fun! I don't know how I'm gonna get through these next few days because I am thinking only about Zanik. I fear we're done. I have a state tournament this weekend. Or so I hear! oh yay...I am so excited to go to a D! tournament--lol my gosh it's a fricken joke! We're at least a LITTLE better than that. I hope we lose right away though&nbsp;so we can be done. I'm through with softball for this year I've always like school ball better--cept last year. I am looking forward to hockey, but that starts at the end of October so I have to wait still for that. I forgot to tell yas! I got my hair cut yesterday! I got at least five inches cut off and it's layered and stuff. I love it! It's so much easier to put up and not at all a pain! It looks real different now. I get grief cuz people thought it was SO beautiful. But hey, it's a pain to dry and wash and brush and put up---I'd like to see YOU do it.&nbsp;I get tired doing it! Glad all that jazz is over for at least a LITTLE while. Yesterday&nbsp;my family and I were gonna go to the DQ, but all the band people were in there---no offense guy---and we didn't wanna be stuck with all those&nbsp;I'll be nice and&nbsp;say 'different' people so we left and got&nbsp;stuff at Hyvee. Better choice anyhow.&nbsp;I wanna just keep going on and on writing because it gets my mind off stuff. But I have nothing else to say. So I guess I will get going everyone---Love you guys! k

But today I got an unexpected call from an old friend of mine whose names is Kjerstin. She lives in my old town and she happened to be in Mankato with her church group--Everblest--they sing and they are returning from being in Mexico. So I went over and her, my mom, and I all went out to eat at Culvers and we talked. I had fun. Then I went to the fair and I had a grand old time haha. Well I hung out with Beth B. most of the time and we had fun. Also I hung out a bit with Mal. I'm kinda sad the fair is over tomorrow cuz it's a good way to hang out with people and whatnot. That is about all for now. I did not go to the fair yesterday. I wasn't feeling it, didn't feel like going and stuff. I'll go tomorrow though, no doubt.

       Hey everyone, I would've written a bit sooner, but my kitty, Blackjack had yet another seizure. It's scary that he has so many. This one he looked like he was sliding across ice and still trying to regain his balance. I at first thought he was trying to get away from my other cat, Max. My family and I are always cautioned when we are around it, we pet him and calm him down afterwards. I fear that even though he's like 11, he might be dying. I'm crying thinking about it, I mean he's MY cat and I don't wanth him to leave. Enough sadness.....Today I didn't really do anything. I could've gone to the fair of course, but I chose not to. I am like really tired and haven't been sleeping too well lately. I was also trying to get back at someone, lol as lame as it sounds, I'm just kinda mad at this person, and this person doesn't even know it. The Twins won today, they've won five in a row and are still only half a game in first! GEEZ! Well, as long as they keep winning, they can't lose their lead. Well I am gonna get going, love yas!

           Hey everyone! The fair is FINALLY in town and it is MUCH fun! Today was the first day. My day consisted me of not doing much til about fivish when I had to go to church to interview an older member of the church. I ate there then walked over to the fair. When I was there I surprisingly saw lots of people I knew. I kinda floated between groups. Then I hung out with Zanik. We hung out in the cow barn a lot with Mindy and Cavit and some other people coming here and there. Oh funny moment. Okay there was like this huge ass mud spot, and guess who stepped in it wearing only flip flops! Yep, ME. Haha, it was funny though, I wasn't even embarrassed at all. But I went and sat under the bingo tent and water kept falling off the top so I got smart and put my feet under there and eventually all the mud got washed off. Eventually my feet dried too, haha. I am planning on spending all day at the fair tomorrow too. It gives me something to do I suppose and I enjoy it. I got to see horsies today, that made me happy. Also kittens, chicks (baby chickens, dur), baby goats, baby cow, ugh all SO cute! It got kinda icky at one point it looked like a storm was brewing, thankfully it didn't get us. PHEW..Kirsten doesn't like storms..let me tell ya...I had fun also embarrassing Jenna. That made me happy too, hehe. Well those are my adventures for today, I'll write later, love ya all! ---kiks

           Howdy everyone! I am officially done with hockey for the rest of the summer..:'( ...tear...I tried skating today without taping my knee though. It wasn't like fantastic, but tons better than I had expected! I am getting better at my slap shot I can lots of times shoot it about a foot off the ground now, but I need to work on it more over the summer. Yesterday I helped move things out of my sister's old apartment back home. It was really fun because she had this old chair she was going to throw away so my Dad threw it down the stairs outside her apartment. Then my brother and I totally ripped it apart and were throwing parts of it around. Chad also attempted riding a broken bike. It was greeeat. Then we got home and had Godfather's pizza..mmmm...my favorite....!!! Earlier that day I went to my brother's double header for baseball. They split. But they were both very good games. Today I didn't really do anything at all. I just stayed in my room...should've vacumed..darn...haha. OMG today my cat almost dissapeared! You know those openings you have on your wall they're called cold air exchanges...they're usually near the floor and like little vents. Anywho..my cat, Max, almost went down it! If he had gone down into it he could be walking around in our house where we wouldn't be able to get him!...He would've been walking around in those silver metal tunnels like people do on TV. Only we probably wouldn't of been able to get Max out! Well my mom saw him (she was painting) and had to pull him out by his tail then his back legs. And of course he's hissing and getting really mad that she was doing that. But she had to! That was kinda icky though! He's been crabby all day now. Then I went to hockey and on the way home got an ice cream at Culvers. It was a grand ol' time! Well that's about it. Zanik's FINALLY coming over tomorrow..yay..Well byebye! love yas!--kirsten

            Hey everyone! Today I deposited some money in the bank that I'm saving up. I don't know what for though, car, college, house, something like that! I have over a hundred bucks which is pretty good considering I have no source of income except an allowance. Earlier I went to my brother's VFW baseball game. It was some good times. They lost though, but to be hones I love baseball and no matter what it's interesting to me, no doubt! After that I went to Hyvee with my mom and got some milk..yes...time of my life! I saw Mr. Rohloff there, but I didn't go and say 'hi' to him cuz he was in the wine and spirits part. OH MY GOSH! I need some! I know that my sound kinda wrong and different--take it how you must but I know what I mean. I'll be honest with you all...once you do something, ANYTHING, whether it's minor or not with a guy, you want more! TRUST ME! Tomorrow I am gonna go to my brother's double header that starts at eleven o' clock AM. After his games I'm gonna go to Mankato to help my sister with some heavy stuff or whatnot because she's moving back home! I'm excited! She'll be here until she gets a job and house I'm sure since she has graduated from college. I feel bad though because I could've hung out with Zanik on Saturday--mini golfing with his older brother and his brother's girlfriend--WOHO..lol...I'm really bad at mini golf though I get like five on each hole...haha...I am not hardcore at it though. I can't wait til the fair cuz then I'll be able to finally hang out with Zanik at least a little! Only thing is....there are a lot of people at the fair..hmm....Well I best be going...love yas all---Special K

      Haha don't ask about the name. I just thought that it was very catchy. lol. Tonight I had hockey and it went so well! My knee didn't hurt all that much only during the drill "The Great One" lol, Kyle made it up. That just consists of a lot of tight turns. Also stopping on my left side hurts a bit. I think I did a very good job of taping my knee tonight too. I went to part of my brother's game and then I went in the car and taped it. Oh guess what everybody! Not that any of you care but it is Zanik and I's three month anniversary...yay...lol! TOo bad I haven't seen him for like three WEEKS! I didn't even get to talk to him today! So I'm kind of sad :(. Hmmm what else?......Tmorrow I am gonna go work on my summer confirmation at Deb's house. I'm almost done which is very good! All I need to do is a few more of those modules, write my I believe statement, go to a church that's not a Lutheran one, interview someone, and do a service project. But i have all of those planned out, cept my I believe statement. I've been riding bike a lot this summer and I think it's helping a lot because I don't think that my knee is swollen anymore. It looks different from my other knee, but that's expected because my knee cap got moved over. I think I'm gonna get moving here I don't have anything else to really say. Bye everyone--love yas---kiks

      I had kind of a scare yesterday. Zanik called me at like 3:30ish yesterady and that is NOT his normal time usually he calls at 8:45 on the dot! So I was kind of like..ok...? He was like ya.. my house got struck by lightning or something, I really couldn't hear him he was quiet and talking quick so I was just like ya..uhu...It turns out though it hit his phone line or whatever, but the funny part is that he had JUST gotten his computer fixed and was talking on it the day before and now like right away it's like completely fried. I'm kind of sad though that he can't talk online with me but..oh well..The homerun derby is tonight I watch through Round 2 then I got really bored with it so I'm like psh screw that! Tomorrow I'm gonna work at pizza ranch for the Relay for Life bussing tables or whatnot. I'm only gonna be there an hour or so but BE THERE PEOPLE! support us! lol...I only have two more hockey practices left. I have to be sure to work on my shot and stuff during the summer and stuff. Volleyball starts in August, I'm kind of confused. Do I wear my knee brace? and if I do where do I put my knee pad? So many questions! lol the county fair is coming up soon! I'm so excited lol. Well I'm going to go everyone much love--kiksten--that's a new one lol

      Hey people its been forever! I'm SO sorry! Well softball is over finally! Or at least that is the impression that I'm getting since no one is calling me. But I don't want to get into that cuz that would just ruin my good mood which we don't want to do. Well I got back from St. Louis on Monday it was a blast! It rained every day except for Sunday, we went to a Cardinals/Mariners game at Busch Stadium. I've been to 5 stadiums now--Metrodome, Comerica Park (Detroit), Miller Park (Milwaukee), Kauffman Stadium (Kansas City), and Busch Stadium (St. Louis). On Saturday I went onto that arch thinger it was so cool the view is awesome! It's sort of creepy up there though. I'm not really a heights person though. We did other stuff too I just don't want to bore you with all the details! I haven't seen Zanik for about two or three weeks now---I'm kinda sad. I'm Zanik-deprived. GOOD NEWS THOUGH! He MIGHT be getting MSN again finally! Hope so! We'd be able to talk much more! One of my friends that used to be on my hockey team in my old town might be coming over this summer. I suggested during the county fair time, that's the only time there's anything big in Waseca. Her name is Holly Barr and she lives in Isanti not Cambridge, where I used to live. Close though. I'm over halfway done w/ summer mentoring for confirmation. I have to write an "I believe" statement that I have to say in front of the church on the day I get confirmed..woho...I have NO idea what to write for it I'm kind of panicked about that too! My grandparents are coming over this weekend and spending a night or two. I'm excited I don't get to see them much and since they're pretty much my only grandparents it's important to spend time with them! I'm excited for their 50th Wedding Anniversary this August. I get to see all the cousins and well I'm just excited to see everyone again. Hum...well I'm going to get going my hands are getting cramped. Love you guys! ---kirsten

       For anyone who reads this and doesn't know...Zanik and I broke up a few days ago. Its been hard no doubt. But I called him yesterday and we talked and we're good now, we discussed why we did. I think we're good friends now. SO nobody feel sorry for me or anything--I'm fine and we're good! Yesterday I went to the Twin's game against the Anaheim Angels. I had a blast! I bought a new MN twins necklace that I just adore. Of course though, the game that I go to is the one they lose of their series...8-3. But that don't matter to me. I enjoyed every moment of it. I love watching them play baseball so much! Tonight I'm going to participate in the Relay for Life. It starts in about an hour so I can't talk forever. Earlier today I went to the track at about ten AM to set up luminaree bags for the event. I helped spell out HOPE on the bleachers with bags and I broke candles apart--to all who did that as well..OW! ....they know what I mean. I got a big sunburned too...whoops. I am downloading songs right now. It's taking a long time. I have about seven now...YAY! Next week captain's practices start for Volleyball all week 9-11 o' clock. I'm kinda excited to go to that to see people and just be doing some sort of sport again. I cannot wait for hockey though. I love hockey SO much. That'll start toward the end of October though. Well that's all I'm going to write for now I think. I need to go eat before I leave and make sure I have everything! Bye! love ya guys--kikster

       I'm gonna use a yellow font I don't care if you can't read it..lol.  I didn't do much today I finally slept in which was nice. I fell asleep about tenish and woke up about ten the next morning. I have been getting like five or six hours of sleep the last two days so last night's early going to bed deal was nice. I worked out today as usual. I am right now trying to download songs and it is taking quite a while to be honest I'm listening to the same song over and over and over haha. Everytime-Britney Spears at the moment. I talked to Z tonight. I finally called him, I felt stupid being the one who called. But hey whatever. Volleyball should be starting within the next few weeks so we'll see how that goes. I'm a bit nervous I will say though. I mean I hope I play and I'm good and that I'm not overwhelmed and whatnot. Other than that August will be a slightly less busy month. I have the Relay for Life and my g-parents 50th wedding anniversary this weekend but that is all I know of now. OH OH! AND I will probably go the the Twin's game this Thursday! I'm so excited that will definently make my month! Well I think that's all for now...talk later--kirsten

       Just got back from our state tournament in Elk River a few hours ago. I have to say that I am a wee bit relieved to finally be through with softball. I am even pondering whether to play southern star next year. It just doesn't tweak my melon like school ball does. By the way 'tweak my melon' is my new phrase. I will now explain how we did. Our first game of the tournament was yesterday early in the morning. We lost to I don't remember what team they were but our team had TONS of errors so we didn't deserve to win it anyways. I didn't get much action in right field, but none-the-less I like outfield. Eventually it WILL become a more valuable position. We played two more teams that day and won both. So we ended up playing at eight in the morning today. We won our game. I had a really good hit with two outs and on an error by the other team when Ten. hit the ball I got from first to home and Ten. later got home. Those were some good insurance runs. We won our next game too. Our last game we didn't win, but I'm not really included in that we cuz I did not play at all! I don't know what I did wrong to not be able to play but whatever it's really not my problem I just felt stupid not playing at all. He had me pinch hit for J but I hit a grounder, and to be honest I didn't really want a hit, because I didn't wanna be the tying run when I had done nothing else. I didn't feel B deserved a win to be honest. I do not think I'm gonna do summer ball next year. If I did I want to be with the older girls like I was last year. They actually let me play and I had fun. We got fourth place to finish it off. Guess who was right about the Doug M. thing?  he's gone exactly how I said he would be. Oh well we'll ALL get over it. Oh back to the tournament thing everyone was drinking this Advocar stuff, well not everybody. To be honest it was all too funny for me. Considering everyone was taking it I didn't see much of an improvement over our usual playing, but hey maybe it works...? It was just funny to watch all that when water and gatorade tweaks my melon just fine! Well I am going to get going everyone I am getting kinda tired...love yas!---kiki
