      The truth is tearing up my heart I can't recognize this place The endless road without a stop sign Can't even find a stranger this time Why am i still holding back my tears In this loneliness there's nothing to fear Every chord still seems a wonder How we could be together Every time i ask if this would be the last Why am i still talking to myself Hoping you will have the keys to my cell Every song might calm the weather but it just draws me deeper How do i get out of this I think i never will A crystal forming in the eye Maybe this would be the last The winding pathdown my face Till i begin to taste the bitterness inside

      Hiding in a corner looking at you Keep a distance While not noticing that i'm around Look at you with your back facing me When you don't know My heart brings a sweet little feelings  You breeze past me, you can't see me is this call fate I'm here with you, right beside you You just don't know I breeze past you, you can't see me From this time There seems to be a bridge Where we keep our distance right where we are  Keeping a distance from you I try Can't get too close From this moment I know I can't breathe Look in my eyes deeply if you will My heart beat fast I tremble on my knees I pray  Just where you fall in love There are smiles, there are tears, there are joy The distance is where I keep my thoughts for you

      翻着我们的照片   想念若隐若现 去年的冬天   我们笑得很甜 看着你哭泣的脸   对着我说再见 来不及听见   你已走得很远 也许你已经放弃我   也许已经很难回头 我知道自己错过   请再给我一个理由 说你不爱我   就算是我不懂   能不能原谅我 请不要把分手当作你的请求 我知道坚持要走是你受伤的藉口 请你回头   我会陪你一直走到最后 就算没有结果   我也能够承 我知道你的痛   是我给的承诺 你说给过我纵容   沉默是因为包容 如果要走   请你记得我   如果难过   请你忘了我

      It's best to wait for the one you want than settle for the one available. Best to wait for the one you love than one who's around. Best to wait for the right one because life's too short to be wasted on just someone.  "Before you get married, keep both eyes open, and after you marry, close one eye." Before you get involved and make a commitment to someone, don't let lust, desperation, immaturity, ignorance, pressure from others or a low self-esteem make you blind to warning signs. Keep your eyes open, and don't fool yourself that you can change someone or that what you see as faults aren't really that important.  Once you decide to commit to someone, over time, their flaws, vulnerabilities, pet peeves, and differences will become more obvious. If you love your mate and want the relationship to grow and evolve, you've got to learn how to close one eye and not let every little thing bother you. You and your mate have many different expectations, emotional needs, values, dreams, weaknesses, and strengths. You are two unique individual children of God who have decided to share a life together.  Neither one of you are perfect, but are you perfect for each other?  Do you bring out the best in each other? Do you compliment and compromise with each other, or do you compete, compare and control?  What do you bring to the relationship?  Do you bring past relationships, past hurt, past mistrust, past pain?  You can't take someone to the altar to alter them. You can't make someone love you or make someone stay. If you develop self-esteem, spiritual discernment, and "a life" you won't find yourself making someone else responsible for your happiness or responsible for your pain. Manipulation, control, jealousy, neediness, and selfishness are not the ingredients of a thriving, healthy, loving and lasting relationship  Seeking status, sex, and security are the wrong to be in a relationship.*TAKE NOTE*  What keeps a relationship strong? * communication * intimacy * a sense of humor * sharing household tasks * some getaway time without business or children * daily exchanges (a meal, shared activity, a hug, a call, a touch,    a note) * shari ng common goals and interests * giving each other space to grow without feeling insecure * giving each other a sense of belonging and assurances of    commitment  If these qualities are missing, the relationship will erode as resentment, withdrawal, abuse, neglect, dishonesty and pain replace the passion.  "As long as we have memories, yesterday remains. As long as we have hope, tomorrow awaits. As long as we have friendship, today is beautiful."  Love is when you take away the feeling, the passion, and the romance in a relationship and find out that you still care for that person.  If You Are :  MARRIED = Love is not about "it's your fault", but "I'm sorry", not "where are you', but "I'm right here", not "how could you" but "I underst and", not "I wish you were", but "I'm thankful you are."  ENGAGED =The True measure of compatibility is not the years spent together but how good you are for each other.  NOT-SO-SINGLE = (Those who have "special someones") Love isn't about becoming somebody else's "perfect person." It's about finding someone who helps you become the best person you can be.  HEARTBROKEN = Heartbreaks last as long as you want and cut deep as you allow them to go. The challenge is not how to survive heartbreaks but to learn from them.  NAIVE = How to be in love: Fall but don't stumble, be consistent but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understand and try not to demand, and get hurt but never keep the pain.  POSSESSIVE = It breaks your heart to see the one you love happy with someone else but it's more painful to know that the one you love is unhappy with you.  AFRAID TO CONFESS = Love hurts when you break up with someone. It hurts even more when someone breaks up with you. But love hurts the most when the person you love has no idea how you feel.  STILL HOLDING ON = A sad thing about life is that when you meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was never bound to be and we just have to let go.  SINGLE = Love is like a butterfly. The more you chase it, the more it eludes you. But if you just let it fly, it would come to you when you least expect it. Love can make you happy but often times it hurts, but love's only special when you give it to whom it's worth.
