      alrite peeps..i'm back..past 2 dys been kinda boring.chionging hmwk throughout e wk n yahz..except tuesday of course!! -grinz- had dis council/prefects camp at MGS (supposed guy haven). our sch was invited there so i kinda tagged along... onli 4 guys frm fmss went though:me,edwin,zhenrong n joel tan...but it was kinda kool...i was a little apprehensive abt goin to MGS for personal reasons.. but got a pretty gd welcome so i jus had to warm up abitz..dumped all our stuff in their MEP rm..kinda smelled lyk e band rm after footdrill..aniwae,e real deal started at anrd 2.15pm when we gathere at sum place..can't remember where it was but it was near their parade square...then they asked us to gather in our grps..cause everyone got dis name tag thingy wif a grp name on it...so gather in yer grps la! mine was called 'Luhrmann" (e best grp of them all! aHAHA!)duno wad it means but heck..grp members totally rocked...super farny..had 12 members... 1 guy frm SJI called ian,2 guys frm ACS called joseph (mr smiley!) n andrew (e supposed wet blanket), one gal frm RGS called krystal,another gal frm GMSS called cassandra (crazy woman) and 7 frm MGS.(too lazy to type all their names..i'm a pig,sue mi.) got to noe their names...ice breakers..e usual drill..i luved e first ice-breaker....e scissors paper stone thingy..might propose to use tt for sec1 orientation nxt yr..thanx fer e idea MGs! then had dis 'chicken game' thing..each grp draw lots larz..then had to act out wad 'chicken' u were n dress up one member to look lyk tt chicken..my grp got e shy chicken..then had to go to e carpark to look for an item which had e tag 'shy' on it...n our grp had to use it...aniwae,found e thing RIGHT OUTSIDE E ENTRANCE IN A BUSH..-_-..n here we were searchin lyk siaoz n e carpark...dotz lor... then our grp lyk quite dead for sum reason...cause we all sporty ppl,duno how to do art..then joseph manfully agreed to be e dressed up chicken. *bravo*. then spent most of e preparation time slacking away...n deciding wad we were goin to do....eventually jus stuck strips of yellow crepe paper on jospeh's back to make him look lyk sum chicken feathers thingy...made this 'handkerchief' too...shy wad! then hide his face behind e thingy lo....got quite frantic when our turn was drawing closer...eventually,during our 'final recap', i had no choice but ot take matters into my own hands n buid up on our initial idea... sorrie if i sounded a little 'commanding' horz..(although i doubt any of them will read this) pulled thru e act n made quite alot of ppl laugh...ahha..  after tt went 'outdoors' for games..had dis telematch thingy...ahahz..andrew wanted to eat e grapes..in e end we shared it among e grp..was still fresh n quite swt..then we played 'fruit n veggie' captain's ball...disgusting...e name tells all..still,my grp being e sportiest grp of all..won all e matches...at e most we lost onli 1! ahahaazz...Lurhmann rulez e pitch!! played fer quite sumtime..after tt went to wash up n eat dinner...had abt an hr to prepare our item for later...was dan farny...we intended to sing e song 'friends forever'...was a peaceful song..then edwin n zhenron aka zr were e 'guitarists' wif a stick n a mop..zr pretended to be blind..ahaaha..our ending at e last word 'friends' wld be lyk..sum rock ending..where everyone wld shout 'FRIENDS!' n edwin n zr wld jump off e stage n pretend to smash their guitars..ahahaz..to scare e heck out of everyone..so,after we said..ummm..sung our prayers, all went to eat lo...usually e guests eat first naturally,but all e guyz in our grp had dis naturall instinct of letting e gals eat first..had dis mini argument on dis ..n eventually e guyz guiltily went to eat cause e MG gals couldn't eat until all e guests got their food..so in a sense we took pity on them...while eatin we all told lame crappy jokes..made everyone laugh at e lameness...  entry gettin too long liaox...will write abt e concert another time...hahaz..later peeps!
