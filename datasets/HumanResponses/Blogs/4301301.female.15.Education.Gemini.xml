      So have you ever listened to the songs "Seventy Times Seven" by Brand New and the song "There's no "I" in Team" by Taking Back Sunday and been like..okay what the heck are they talking about? Or have you heard of a feud that was going on between the two bands but never quite heard what they were fighting about? Well I've also wondered that but now, I know...I'll share this with you.  A few years back, Jesse Lacey from BN was best friends with then memeber of TBS John Nolan, but Jesse's girlfriend cheated on him with John. John called Jesse and the conversation went no where and at the end Jesse said "You're as subtle as a brick on the small of my back so lets end this call and end this conversation" and hung up. Later those words were added to the BN song, "Seventy Times 7"(heres the song lyrics):  -Back in school they never taught us  what we needed to know  Like how to deal with despair  or someone breakin your heart  For twelve years I've held it all together  but a night like this is beggin to pull me apart  I played it quiet left you deep in conversation  I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen  I remember I kept thinking  that I know you never would  And now I know I want to kill you  like only a best friend could   Everyone's caught on to everything you do  Everyone's caught on to...   As if it happening wasn't enough  I got to go and write a song  just to remind myself how bad it sucked  Ignore the sun, covers over my head  Wrote a message on my pillow that says  "Jesse, stay asleep in bed"  Don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)  Search your cell for something which to hang yourself  They say you need to pray  if you want to go to heaven  But they don't tell you what to say  when your whole life has gone to Hell!   Everyone's caught on to everything you do  Everyone's caught on to...  (and I can't let you let me down again)  Everyone's caught on to everything you do  (and I can't let you let me down again)  Everyone's caught on to...   So is that what you call a getaway?  Tell me what you got away with  Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish  I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids  Have another drink and drive yourself home  I hope there's ice on all the roads  And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt  and again when your head goes through the windshield   Is that what you call tact?  You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back  So let's end this call and end this conversation  And is that what you call a getaway?  Tell me what you got away with  Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed  when you say "best friends" means friends forever   Is that what you call a getaway?!!  Tell me what you got away with!!  Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish!!  I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids!!  Have another drink and drive yourself home!!  I hope there's ice on all the roads!!  And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt  then when your head goes through the windshield!!   (I can't let you let me down again)  Everyone's caught on to everything you do  (and I can't let you let me down again)  Everyone's caught on to...  (I can't let you let me down again)  Everyone's caught on to everything you do  (and I can't let you let me down again)  Everyone's caught on to...-  So as you see, definetly bitter and angry and so on.....Wonder where the title to the song comes from? Well if your familiar with the Bible you might know that Jesus calls upone people to forgive others not just 70 but 70 x 7 times. But as an answere to this song TBS wrote one intitled "There's no "I" in Team" which goes something like this:  -Well I can't regret,  can't you just forget it?  I started something I couldn't finish  And if we go down,  we go down together  best friends means,  well best friends means   And I've got a twenty-dollar bill  that says you're up late night starting  fist fights versus fences in your backyard  Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor  Soaking in sympathy  from friends who never loved you  nearly half as much as me   Broken down in bars and bathrooms  All I did was what I had to  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's just what anyone would do  Take the time to talk about it  Think a lot and live without it  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's something unforgivable...ohoh   Well I can't regret,  can't you just forget it?  I started something I couldn't finish  If we go down,  we go down together  best friends means,  well best friends means   You never knew  well i never told you...  Everything I know about breaking hearts  I learned from you, it's true  I've never done it with the style and grace you have  But I've made long term plans  based on these mistakes   Broken down in bars and bathrooms  All I did was what I had to  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's just what anyone would do  Take the time to talk about it  Think a lot and live without it  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's something unforgivable   Is this what you call tact?  I swear you're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back  so let's end this call,  and end this conversation  there's nothing worse...  (that's right he said, that's right he said it)  I swear, you have no idea  The jealousy that became me thinking  (that's right he said)  that you always had it way too easy   Broken down in bars and bathrooms  All I did was what I had to  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's just what anyone would do  Take the time to talk about it  Think a lot and live without it  Don't believe me when I tell you  it's something unforgivable   Best friends means I pulled the trigger  Best friends means you get what you deserve  Best friends means I pulled the trigger  Best friends means you get what you deserve  Best friends means I pulled the trigger  Best friends means you get what you deserve  Best friends means I pulled the trigger  Best friends means you get what you deserve  Best friends means I pulled the trigger  Best friends means you get what you deserve   Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!!!  Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!!!-  And as you can see they use the same line as in BN's song, after these two songs were exchanged and all the two friends made up later and now TBS and BD aren't fighting or Stray light run which would be John's new band....okay well that's the story!

      These past two weeks I've been listening to alot of MatchBook Romance.   Matchbook Romance is composed of four guys, all from New York, they were formally known as The Getaway. They released an EP on the interent before being singed onto Epitaph Records and then released their second album, Stories & Alibies. September 7th is when they are releasing their third album, it is a split with Motion city Sound Track.  Stories &Alibies is made up of twelve songs, one of which is just instermantal. My personal favorite's would be; Playing for Keeps(track 3), Lovers and Liars(track 5), My Eyes Burn(track 8), and the The Greatest Fall(track 12). This album is composed of heart felt emo lyrics about their many problems in life....which seems to be woman at this point in time.  Stories &Alibies is a very polished album with catchy songs and a minimum amount of screaming. If you enjoy bands such as Taking Back Sunday and The Get Up Kids you'll definetly enjoy this number. I'd have to say that these guys have a definete future in the music buisness.   Find more at: http://www.matchbookromance.com

      Love. It's a word that in this world has come to mean so many different things even though the true meaning has never changed. People in this life have come to abuse it more often than not. We use it to get our way and we use it to make people do stuff that they don't want to do. They're so desperate for love that they'll do anything to hear someone say it to them. They'll steal, they'll kill and they'll sell their bodies all for "love". Love is not broken promises, love is not broken homes, love is not unwanted children, love is not shown in the back seat of a car, love cannot be forced. Love is not saying one thing and doing another. Love is not impulsive, cruel, critical, or manipulative.  Love is not disrespectful and thoughtless.  I really like how Paul explains love in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8, "Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails."  In verse 13 it goes on to say, "And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love.  But the greatest of these is love."  This is so true, love is a great thing.  I just wish that there were some universal rule that made it impossible to say it unless you meant it.

      Sleep . . . I want sleep . . . I've often wondered if sleep is such a necessary thing.  I know, that sounds dumb but why do we have to sleep?  There are so many cool things that we could be doing when we're sleeping.  I think I heard somewhere that we spend at least a third of our life sleeping.  I don't know about you but I kinda find that a waste.  I'll have to admit it, but I totally enjoy sleeping and next to showering, it's one of my favorite things to do (by myself that is).  Anyway, gotta cut this blog short - some dude is here and I would rather hang out with him than write in this blog so LATER.

      Have you ever noticed how easy it is to befriend a kid?&nbsp; All they want is for you to play with them and love them.&nbsp; They'll accept and love you no matter what.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kids don't care&nbsp;if you're ugly,&nbsp;and&nbsp;they don't care&nbsp;if you're the best looking person next to Brad Pitt.&nbsp; They don't care if you got totally sloshed the night before&nbsp;and they don't care if you'd gone to church that morning.&nbsp; They don't care if you get good grades and they don't care if you fail every class.&nbsp; They don't care if you drive a BMW and they don't care if you just crashed your Kia.&nbsp; They don't care if you live in a big house and they don't care if you ate your breakfast out of a dumpster.&nbsp; The don't care if you're wearing Calvin Klein and they don't care if you're stuck in your sister's friend's cousin's hand-me-downs.&nbsp; They'll believe you when you say that you'll take them to the park and they'll remember when you forget to.&nbsp; They'll give you a second chance when you let them down and they're always willing to forgive.&nbsp; Maybe we should all have the heart of a child.

      Have you ever done something that doesn't look hard until you're in the middle of it and you have no idea what you're doing and there's flames everywhere that just get bigger with water?&nbsp; I've always seen people barbeque and it doesn't look hard.&nbsp; You put the meat on, soil it in barbeque sauce, you flip them a couple times and then eventually they're done.&nbsp; I've never seen anyone char them in a matter of minutes of try to put the big flames out with water and they just get bigger . . . is it me or do I sound really blonde.&nbsp; Maybe some things just need some getting used to before you actually can make them nice and tender.&nbsp; I guess the first time doing anything you kinda suck until you get used to it.&nbsp; Walking, riding a bike, swimming, kissing . . . the list could go on forever.&nbsp; I guess some things you can just be totally good at right off the bat.&nbsp; Probably doesn't happen very often but there are those few lucky people who you can't stand because everything they do they do good and did good from the beginning cuz they're just like that.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm off to hang out with the coolest guy ever so have a great day and guard your carnal treasure.

      Have you ever had one of those days when you think everything is alright, everything is normal, and then you get a knock at the door and you think hey, maybe that package is finally here and you open the door and it's Jehovah's witnesses?&nbsp; It's kinda like seeing icecream in the freezer and finding out that the bucket's empty.&nbsp; I've never actually taken the time to talk to them before but these people somehow knew who my brother was and so I figured I'd give them the time of day.&nbsp; I've been really interested in other religions lately - not to have another one but to know what we're fighting against.&nbsp; I don't know a lot about the Jehovah's witnesses but I do know that they're wacked.&nbsp; These ladies at the door though were pretty nice as they all&nbsp;are I guess&nbsp;but they didn't get the hint when I told them I already had a relationship with God.&nbsp; Yea, that means I know what&nbsp;a Bible is - they thought I'd never seen it.&nbsp; They make you feel kinda like your God isn't good enough even though I think they believe in the same one.&nbsp; They think their bible is somehow way better but say that it's the same as the Christian Bible.&nbsp; I don't know these things but I think I'm gonna start&nbsp;researching them so that next time they come to the door I can ask them the questions.&nbsp; Anyway, trampolines rule and have a great day.

       Analogies are great aren't they?&nbsp; They're like those McDonald's toys with the hidden message in them that you need the red screen to read.&nbsp; Life is confusing and you need the red screen sometimes.    &nbsp;  Have you ever noticed that&nbsp;finding God&nbsp;is kinda like potty training?&nbsp; So you're a baby.&nbsp; Life is great.&nbsp; All you do is eat, sleep and poop.&nbsp; The problem is, you have to sit in that poop until someone changes you.&nbsp; It's gross.&nbsp; You don't really like it but you don't know any different; that's just how life is.&nbsp; Then one day you get introduced to the potty.&nbsp; Now you like this potty because it makes you not have to be poopy anymore.&nbsp; You realize that there is another way.&nbsp; No more wetness.&nbsp; Now although you like this potty a lot and know it's the best thing for you, there's always times when Blues Clues is so interesting that you forget about the potty.&nbsp; The puppy outside is just way more interesting than the potty and you forget.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; I'm wet again.&nbsp; I'm poopy again.&nbsp; But someone always comes along and says, "It's okay, we'll just change you and you can start again fresh."&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding God&nbsp;is the same way.&nbsp; Here you are, living your life.&nbsp; It's going fine.&nbsp; You're not totally happy but it's good enough - you know what you're doing and you don't know any different.&nbsp; Then one day someone introduces you to God and you think wow, I can't believe I was living how I was living.&nbsp; This is so great I don't know how someone would want to live any differently.&nbsp; I don't feel poopy anymore.&nbsp; But, eventhough you have this new life there's still the wet times, you still make mistakes and you still mess up.&nbsp; You get caught up in life and you forget about God.&nbsp; You get discouraged and you think that this is it, you're back to your old life.&nbsp; The great thing is though, God is always there to forgive you and let you start fresh.&nbsp; He's always there to change your diaper.

      Isn't it wierd how sometimes the things you think are so dumb are actually kinda cool? I find it that way with a lot of things starting with this blog. When I first heard about them - thought they were pretty stupid and I still kinda do but they, like most things, can be used for either good or evil and I intend to use this blog for good. I often wonder if there's just a select group of people who will conform to any situation. They can be a jock, they can be a band geek, they can be in drama club, they can do drugs on the lawn in front of school. They can do this all at the same time and not be convicted. Is it what you do that makes you who you are or is it who you are that makes you do what you do? Can going to McDonalds make you a hamburger? Can going to church make you a Christian? Too many people define themselves by what they do. People drink and say that it's who they are so they can't change it. Doing drugs is who they are. Swearing is a part of who they are - without it they wouldn't be themselves. If you change, are you still you? Do you perpetually convert into a different person your whole life? Is there a time when you find who you really are and stay that way until you die?

      I had on new clothes, New sneaks on my feet. I was there for class on time, Went to the back and took my seat. Yeah, I'm moving up, I'm already grown. Soon I'll be graduating, And out on my own. I talked to some of my friends, We were all having fun. Said some things I shouldn't have said, Did stuff I shouldn't have done. I knew I was different. I felt God touch my heart, I knew I should set a standard, But then I'd be set apart. Walking to the bus, I was not looking for strength. I heard the car tires screeching, But now it's too late. I'm standing in this room, And I can see the heavenly gate. Oh no! I never prayed. I thought I had time to get it straight. An angel walked to me, He had a book in his hand. I knew it was the Book of Life, When would this dream end? I told him my name, And he began to look. Then he looked at me sadly and said, Your name is not in this book. Angel, this is a dream, No, I can't be dead! He closed the book and turned away, He whispered - You cannot proceed ahead. No...no this can't be real, Angel, you can't turn me away. Let me talk to God, Maybe he'll let me stay. He led me to the gate, Jesus came to me. He did not let me in but said, Beloved what is your need? Jesus, I cried, please, Don't cast me away from you. Tears ran down his face as he said, You knew what you needed to do. Lord, please I'm young, I never thought I would die. I thought I'd have plenty of time, Death caught me by surprise. Lord, I went to church, Please Jesus, I believe. He said you would not accept me, My love you would not receive. Lord, there were too many hypocrites, They weren't being true. He took a step back and asked, What does that have to do with you? Lord, my family claimed to be saved, They weren't real. You know. He said, I died for you, Now I have to go. I fell to my knees crying to Him, Lord, I planned to be real tomorrow. I couldn't make Him understand, I had never felt such sorrow. Then it hit me hard, I said, Lord, where will I go? He looked into my eyes and said, My child you already know. Please Jesus, I begged, The place is so hot. It seemed to trouble and grieve him, He whispered, DEPART FROM ME, I KNOW YOU NOT. Lord, you're supposed to be love, How can you send me to damnation? He replied, With your mouth you said you loved me, But each day you rejected my salvation. With that in an instant, Day turned into night. I never knew such torture could be, Now too late, I know the Bible is right. If I can tell you anything, Hell has no age. It is a place of torture, Separated from God and full of rage. You know, I thought it was funny - a joke, But this one thing is true. If you never accept Jesus Christ, HELL IS WAITING FOR YOU! So please, ask Him into your heart.

      I don't know about you but I HATE junk mail.  I set my email inbox to exclusive so that I can only see messages from people who are on my contact list.  Lately though, I've been having to check the junk email folder because of the possibility of new addresses emailing me for school stuff.  I've noticed through reading those subjects every day that every single one - and I mean EVERY one is about either getting "bigger" or getting out of debt.  I swear, all the world cares about is sex and money.  They try to trick you too - they have just a regular name in the name box and then hi there or Re: something in the subject and you're like, well I don't remember these people and then you open it and wish that you hadn't.  I stopped doing that.  You know, you learn your lesson after a while.  I had one getting out of debt one that said "Get out of debt the Christian way" and I thought wow, they'll use anything.  Trying to make you think it's okay because it's "Christian" - YEA RIGHT!!!  The other ones are more obviously not for opening - "The 10 Inch Plan" from Wish Master; "Nonsurgical" from Impresslover; "No Medication" from Gratify Her; and my favorite of the day "King-Sized PP" from Mr. Johnson.  Seriously - do people have nothing better to do with their time than write dirty emails?  This world is pretty sad.  Sometimes I want to just live in a bubble where you don't get dirty emails, you don't hear of people dying on the news and you do'nt owe anybody any money.  That would be my utopia.  Anyway, I wish to depart to my exhilarating day so have a good one.

      In the midst of this getting ready to leave, it hasn't exactly sunk in yet that I'm only here for 8 more days.  I mean I totally love the idea but I'm one of those people who doesn't totally understand until the event has happened.  For example, when I was pregnant with Kaylie, I knew that I was gonna have a baby (as usually happens when you're pregnant) but it didn't totally register with me until I was holding a slimy little body in my arms.  Wierd how that happens.  I am totally excited though about the thought of not being in Terrace for a whole eight months.  I guess I may be back for Christmas but not totally forsure.  I figured out that I like change and hate change all at the same time.  I guess it depends on what is changing.  I seem to like moving since I've done it 8 (about to be 9) times in the last 3 years.  I like new things.  I like the newness of a house when it is totally empty and the change that your stuff makes.  I hate endings though.  I hate breakups, I hate packing, I hate graduation (mostly).  I hate leaving but like coming.  On a side note - Canada sucks.  We haven't even won as many medals as Michael Phelps has by himself - what a sad country we live in that it's bigger than every country but the US, and tiny countries have more medals than us.  WHATEVER!!!!  Anyway, I have to get rid of some furnature so guard your carnal treasure and have a great Saturday.

      Compromise - I'm all about it. I think that in any relationship there needs to be compromise. I do not mean that you need to compromise yourself, I'm a firm believer in being yourself, I mean that some things you do have to be compromised a little bit. Before you think I'm getting really off here let me explain myself. I'm watching golf. I don't particularly like golf but I'm watching it because a certain someone I'm kinda fond of likes it. Are you getting what I mean now? I'm also going golfing this afternoon - didn't think I'd ever golf in my life, mostly because I know I wouldn't be good at it and I only like doing things I'm good at (most of the times), but I'm doing it. I guess I think that everyone is totally and completely different. Some people may be similar in a lot of ways but still very different in others. I think that if people aren't willing to compromise at all, then your relationship is not going to go anywhere fast. If you always want your own way then you're too busy being selfish and you're not able to experience new things that you wouldn't otherwise experience. Experience is good. It helps you grow and keeps you from being stagnate. Anyway, gotta pick up some tips before the big game so keep your stick on the ice.

      If I had a list of the ten best things in life, seeing old friends would be one of them.  I hung out with a couple of my friends tonight that I hadn't hung out with in quite a while and while it was refreshing, it was also a challenge.  I have pretty significantly changed my lifestyle since then and it's kinda funny talking about old times and hard resisting the things I used to do.  It's worth the temptation though to see and talk to them again.  Man, good times had.  There are some people in this lifetime that you just click with and it's so cool.  I doesn't matter what sex they are and it doesn't matter how many or how few times you've hung out together, you just click and it's just awesome.  I realized tonight just how much your friends influence who you are.  You do what your friends do - no arguments.  True, you can hang out with them and not do what they do but in reality, the people you hang out with every day shape who you are.  I've been blessed this summer with awesome friends who are a very good influence on me and who I love hanging out with because they don't lead me to do things that I would otherwise be tempted to do.  Though I've appreciated them, I haven't as much as tonight.  Without them I might be swaying a bit from God's path and I do not want to do it.  It's just strange the effect friends can have on you to do things that you know aren't right but they make them seem okay.  Anyway, one of those awesome friends, who I am so thankful for, is on his way here right now so I'd better jet.  God is soooo cool!

      It's so sad that this summer is almost over!!  But, at the same time I am totally stoked for the fall.  Summer is always a cool time of the year - I've always enjoyed it.  Although it is not my absolutely favorite season, some of the things it brings are awesome.  Camp, VBS, camping (though not this year), lying on the beach, swimming in the lake, tanning, road trips, you know, all that fun stuff that can only come in the summer.  I have to say that for me this is the best summer that I can ever remember.  HANDS DOWN!  I didn't think it was going to be very good - I moved back to Terrace and into my parents place, where I didn't think I'd ever be living again, and thought that it was going to be a long boring rainy summer that didn't really amount to much.  BUT, God is so cool that I ended up spending three weeks doing kids stuff, which I absolutely love and then met this guy that God totally exceeded my expectations with.  It's so wierd how God works sometimes because at the beginning of the summer I was totally sworn off relationships and totally didn't want one and now I am in the best one I could have ever hoped for.  Anyway, it's SUNNY and I'm in a good mood so I'm gonna go out on my lawn and just enjoy the SUN for a while.  Peace.

      Have you ever found the news really depressing?  Since it comes on every day on numerous channels, it's pretty hard to avoid.  What I want to know is, why do we always find bad things interesting and not good things?  The principal at my senior high school mentioned to me once that he was frustrated that the local news paper didn't want to print the honor roll results.  He said that if he went and molested one of the students it would make it on the front page but they wouldn't put student accomplishments anywhere in there.  The news is exactly the same.  I think I've seen one maybe two positive stories in my life.  All I ever hear about is murders, rapes, beatings, robberies, cheating polititians.  If you think about it, pop culture magazines are the same way too.  Celebritys doing drugs, cheating on their spouces, maybe having a baby, maybe getting married, a lot of maybes and a lot of rumers - it's great not being famous.  But still, why can't we be interested in good things?  Why can't we just be happy for people and not have to feel sorry for they all the time?  Why oh why oh why?

      I have to admit that I've been a little bit of a tetris addict the last couple days and today in my weird thought pattern I figured out that playing tetris is a little bit like finding the right guy. You've got all these pieces that have to fit together and you do the best you can but some of them just leave a couple holes. As time goes on you get a big hole. Now you know that you need that one special piece to fit into the hole. But, you get impatient. You try to fill the hole with the wrong pieces and they just don't fit totally right and you end up having a big mess. Eventually you wish that you had just waited for that one special piece because then you wouldn't be in the mess that you're in. The great thing is that you can get back to where you were if you work at it. Little by little you can get rid of the mess and have a clean slate again. The pieces are things that come at you in life that make you who you are. The trick is finding that one special person that totally melds together with you.  The wrong pieces are the wrong guys you date and the wrong things you do and the make your life a mess.  But, with God's help, little by little you can piece your life back together with the right pieces and then the next time you can wait for that right piece becuase you know it's worth it.  And on the plus side you can beat the high score.

      I've been noticing more and more lately that I cannot do anything without God. When life is going good I tend to forget about Him because I get so caught up in what I'm doing. I feel like a dog with it's tail between it's legs sometimes when I realize that the reason things are going downhill is because I haven't talked to Him lately and haven't trusted Him. Why is it in our nature to do this? Sometimes I get so exhausted and disappointed with myself that I just give up. I stop trying and I turn my heart off - I stop caring. I hate that. I hate not caring. When I start not caring, I don't talk to God, I don't read my Bible, I do stuff I know is wrong and I don't care.  I need to stop doing that.  I know that there's only one way that that can happen and that's to start caring.  It's hard though.  It's not an easy journey.  I know what the path is, I just tend to walk in the bushes a lot.  I need to start reading my Bible more and talking to God a lot more and trust that if I do that, He'll help me to start caring again.  I'll get back on His path and things will be good again.  I just have to remember to pray that when I'm on the right path, I'll stay on it.  I won't forget about Him and I won't take advantage of Him.  Okay, I'm done - God is SO good and he's blessed me so much lately.  How can you not care about someone who cares so much for you even when you don't care about Him?

      Insecurities. They are one thing that I honestly hate about life but at the same time I think that in a way they keep you humble. If you really think about it, your insecurities keep you from doing a lot of things that could have been really great. One of my biggest insecurities is being embarrassed.  There were a lot of things in highschool, and even now, that I didn't do because I was afraid I'd mess up and get made fun of.  I  liked playing volleyball in junior high but when it came to senior high and we had to actually try out for the team, I didn't because I was afraid I wouldn't make it and I would get looked down on.  I didn't dress up on dress up days, not because I thought it was dumb, but because I was scared that I would look stupid and get embarrassed.  I didn't do solos in jazz band because I was afraid I'd mess up.  I pretended some things I did, I did on purpose because otherwise I'd look even more stupid.  I eventually turned my feelings off because I was sick of being embarrassed and hurt.  I just did stupid things and pretended I was totally fine with it and pretended it didn't matter.  I didn't do any of the things I was scared of doing before, I did stupid things that totally weren't good for me but I didn't care.  I didn't have any feelings.  As time goes on I'm still trying to get those feelings back.  I still have that I don't care attitude and I think that if I'm gonna get anywhere in life I have to be embarrassed once in a while - it might even be good for me.  Anyway, the shower's free now so have a great day and don't worry, God still loves you even if no one else does :-)
