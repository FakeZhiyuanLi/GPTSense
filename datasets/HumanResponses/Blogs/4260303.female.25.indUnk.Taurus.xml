      For all those deeply involved in the heated debate over what causes season changes, I hate to say "I told you so", but....   urlLink http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/season.htm   I would like to reiterate a couple key points from this article (which was the first I found when searching):  "The seasons have nothing to do with how far the Earth is from the Sun."  "...the seasons are caused by the Earth being tilted on its axis by an average of 23.5 degrees (Earth's tilt on its axis  actually varies  from near 22 degrees to 24.5 degrees). "

      Hello everybody.  I hope everyone's weekend was pleasant.  Before I forget, we need to get Jon Shaw on here.  Somebody get me his non-work email address.  Jeremy...I'm looking in your direction.   Welcome back to the right coast, Ryan.   My whirlwind beach trip was good this weekend.  My brother and sister-in-law came to my place on Friday night, so I actually got to hang out among good company for the first time in a month.  A trip to and from the beach in 36 hours was a little more stressful than I'd like, but it was good to be on the sand in nice weather.  I got a brutal sunburn, so I feel pretty crappy.  The sunburn and the active weekend are also contributing to me being extremely tired.  My body and I just aren't getting along much lately.  Hopefully we'll work it out.   Hope this finds everyone well.  People need to start posting more.   Love, mjl.

      So...I logined to this place from the hotel room, and never got a chance to post.  It must have occurred after I sauntered into my hotel room from the beach.  I tripped over some urlLink  furry creature  at the camp ground. I drank a lot of beer that night, and I don't remember. [For those slow folks, read "bad joke re: previous post"]  I'm back and "almost" de-jetlagged. Your fellow traveling employee has ended his official business trip of the year, and is looking forward to some awesome vacation time, culminating in a raucous occasion in Raleigh.  So, I was uut and abuut (impersonating a clever computer guy from Canada that I met in Seattle) across the great lands of this nation for four days. I enjoyed the time immensely. I go to spend time with some old friends, I geeked out with new company software (and all the users across the country who were there). I even got to meet a application specialist working on  urlLink Longhorn , after his presentation at our conference, even though it closely resembled a pep talk for  urlLink assimilation .  Friends? I got to see Matt shortly before he left for the airport. Even though Laurel was already out in Philly, I hailed a cab up to Capitol Hill (skipping an extravagant dinner at the Space Needle in the process) to see Matt for 2 brief hours. Palmer arrived shortly later, and Heather drove us out to the airport (which I had just left from, riding on a bus for 45 minutes).  Palmer, Sarah(Palmer's fiance), and Chris and I hung out the next two nights. Saw the beach on  urlLink Puget Sound , got to eat at some great restaurants, checked out the  urlLink EMP , and otherwise got  urlLink nice and toasty  on my company's tab. Of course, toasty meaning...I drank my favorite beer of all time. And I brought a six pack home with me. mmmmmm. Don't tell anyone.  See you in the board room. R

      No comments on the story about a beer drinking bear?  It's a story about a BEAR drinking BEER!  A BEAR!  This is the work we do, ladies and gentlemen!   Madame CEO, I propose mandatory weekend hours for everyone to compensate for this egregiously poor performance.   Respectfully, VP Red

      So here it is 3:30 again...piles of work, no ambition.   When I go to one of my schools, I have to get on I-95 N for a couple miles.  Every time, I'm tempted to throw all my work files out the window, buy a case of beer and keep heading north.  Everything here is wonderful, don't get me wrong.  But it's like looking at a beautiful painting...as nice as it is, you're not  there.   It's a two-dimensional artifact that you can only see.  Yes, I'm "here," and attempting to enjoy each day as much as I can, but I just feel like a large part of me is not here.  Everything has been crazy since I've been here,, so maybe it's just a matter of giving things some time to even out.  We'll see where the road leads, I suppose.  I guess that's where that mysterious notion of faith gets involved.  I'm still trying to figure that one out.  Some days it's a little clearer, others it's a foggy mess.  It's a work in progress.  Sorry for the lamentation.  This blog should by no means take on this serious of a tone.  As punishment, I sentence myself to a 45 minute drive home.  I hope this finds you all well.   Love, mjl.

      So apparently, those in authority in Johnston County Schools decided to block access to webmail services.  So I will not be able to access my email account during the day.  The didn't get the blogger, though....yet.  I will not be defeated!  I do have a work email, and it is  urlLink michaellang@johnston.k12.nc.us   Music of the morning:  Sparklehorse -  Good Morning Spider  and Califone -  Roomsound

      Chris, good work on the name.  Obscure references to the greatest Pearl Jam album ever will mean nothing but profit for Jack's Hat, Inc....profit, I tell you.  Come to think of it, I could probably use a little more creative name than my own.  I'm going to go work on that.  Bo, you're mysteriously absent.  Don't give me the "work is sooooo crazy" excuse...that's just stupid.  Remember who you  really  work for.   Love, mjl.

      Ok, so our beautiful CEO and Jonesy are in.  Where's everyone else?  This is one of the very few mandatory activities of all Jack's Hat employees and associates.  Get on the ball or get off it!

      Welcome to the conference room, Jonesy.  Clean yourself up.  And wear some pants, for God's sake.  Just because we're incompetent doesn't mean we want to see your legs.
