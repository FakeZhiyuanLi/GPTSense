      It is funny how we feel towards good and bad times.  We can always remember the past horrible experiences perfectly but we can hardly describe the good ones.  Butt when we're having a good time we can't even remember what it felt like to have a bad time.  And the bad times in our minds are defined by the good times that we have had.  And then sometimes if you are mad enough you are begging for release but you also want to stew in your madness.  It is a viscious cycle is it not?

      why on earth do they call them firemen.  Wouldn't that mean when the house is flooded they'ed bring in the fire hose.  "Captain the ship is flooding! What can we do?"  "Dial 119 for the FIREMEN!" I don't know it just doesn't really work for me.  That leads to loss of water the so called "firemen" of today use tons of it.  What happens when we run out.  No really I have heard people worry about this.  One friend had a pretty convincing theory for the answer to why the earth's water was depleting.  He claimed "People are drinking it all."  These are the type of people that are aloud out on the streets.  They are aloud to drive a car.  Heck they are aloud to get married and reproduce.  Allowing people like this to have children is like throwing a poodle into the cockpit of a space shuttle and saying "Let's see what happens..."  I'll bet that guy is in prison now because he does not strike me as someone that could easily avoid abduction.  I can picture him now in a 10 by 5 cell guzzling water out of the prison tap screaming "THEY'LL PAY!! THEY'LL ALL PAY!!!"  When we do pay, and it is only a matter of time before we do, what will we pay?  By the time our water is completely depleted we probably will not exist any more but if we finally died off who would be depleting all the water.  Holy crackers that's a big one.

      Why dial up.  Why.  What would give anyone the notion.  Why don't they give adsl to everyone for free.  Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  I cannot pursue much of anything with a lag like this.  Heck i can barely "pursue" my own email or write these pathetic blogs for people that do not care.  Butt seriously, adsl should be for all the masses to enjoy.  With the advent of the EU UN and NATO all the countries are uniting.  All the people are identified.  Everyone is watched so why the heck can't they just fudge it all over and smooth out the internet.  Because they are evil trolls.  Do you understand.  It's as if the internet were run by a horde of especially harsh accountants and marketers.  The Marketers rope you in and force you to buy their product.  ie. pop ups and free dinners at chilis.  Accountants have all the evil tendencies. ie. pages you cannot close and "page cannot be displayed".  simply put if you take  ACCOUNTANTS+MARKETERS=THE TROLLS THAT STOCK THE INTERNET That is my bogus theorum for tonight.  I am tire and you don't car good night.

      what a day.  Hot, hard, sweaty, dirty, and long.  Hey something interesting here...I have received word that a tornado touched down in Budapest.  That has never ever happened in Hungary.  Do you know what that means...It means that there is only one question left to ask: "WHAT WILL THE WORLD LOOK LIKE THE DAY AFTER TOMMORROW?"  Wha ha ha.  Yeah that movie was okay but not that great if you catch my drift and if you did not than you are a bad catch.  Something else on the news Candidate Kerry came riding through Cincinnati today.  Yeah.  I was surprised.  I was driving down the parade rode soon before the festive event and I noted that the sidewalks were littered with hippies and all manner of tydye.  I saw a dog with a tube top on.  The last thing that I wish I could forget was a man dressed in a flesh body suit and in drag.  Yeah you guessed it the bikini.  AARRGGH.  His face was covered with all manner of alarming make up and aaach i cannot stand to write any more.  I am not Homophobic and i do not intend to sound so but what i witnessed yesterday was horrid.  Thanks Kerry.  We owe you another one.

      If you know where the line "You can't run from me Shan" comes from write me and let me know.  You could be the lucky winner.  Winners will receive from themselves a hearty pat on the back.  So those of you who know the answer already congratulations.  If you really want to email me and tell me about it.  Either way you get nothing.

      There is something that I hate.  For a hypothetical situation let us say that I am watching Dumb and Dumber...and enjoying it...HARRY YOUR HANDS ARE FREEZING...MOCKING BIRD...TIC TAC SIR...yeah you know.  Now let us also say that we are at the point where Harry's leg is on fire. (for those of you who have not seen the movie or don't care i shall paraphrase,  Harry the idiot is hitting on some chick and accidentally catches his leg on fire, needless to say everything goes to hell)  I am watching this laughing hysterically when someone across the rooms starts making brilliant observations like: "This movie is Dumb"  "Why didn't he tell her that his leg was on fire and then come back" "Where's the mountain dew".  I will respond to these people in order of 1,2,and 3. 1) Yes the movie is dumb.  Look at the freaking title and then tell what the intellectual value of this movie is.  Why are you saying these things.  What are you trying to prove.  Of course the movie is dumb.  It is about two very dumb people and one of them happens to be dumber than the other.  Get a dang grip you pompous bag of monkey excrement.  2)  I'll tell you why and this ties in with my previous answer.  Harry is an idiot.  Do you know why.  A writer wrote a part and Jeff Daniels is playing it.  Now if you are still boggled why Jeff Daniels is acting so dumb let me spell it out for you.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.  He is being payed obscene amounts of money doing what you do everyday for free.  3)  In the fridge DUH.

      Well here I am.  Who reads these things anyways.  Apparantly I do.  Cool people read these things.  should I talk about me.  i am an artist, musician, singer, actor, and all around good guy.  i like long romantic walks on the beach.  okay cut the crap i've never been to the stinking beach and i live in a landlocked country.  i am of course a student so if during the school year i don't post for over a weak that is because i am working on something more important than a ridiculous rant.(alliteration, w00t!)  My first question for everyone out there:  Have you ever seen Sting perform for free in hero square.  It was honestly one of the cooler experiences of my life.  Except for the undeniable fact that i went with my best friend Ivan and his girlfriend.  I told him "hey i hate being the third party..." to which he promptly replied "I'll make sure it's not like that.   Well i trusted him he is my best friend after all...and the fact that i have never had a girlfriend of my own is a sore subject.  I go to a tiny school where all the girls consider me thier big brother...thanks alot.  Anyways halfway through the concert they were over there totally sucking face.  Punks.  Well at least someone can get some.    Welcome to my world of blog.  Unless I have something important to say I will merely rant.  Thanks for the webspace and part on.  -Felbot

       if i had a dime for every time someone said "cut the mullet" i would very possibly be one of the richest hogs in the world.  This is a tribute to the Mullet.  Glory to the mullet Gods as we offer sacrifices and burnt offerings of fruity smelling candles.  The armies of the mulletron will one day rise again in their  MULL titudes.  I do not personally have a mullet but a few of my friends have done so.  One in particular had his cut right before a prom/banquet/crappy school function sort of thing.  It was okay though since his date was wearing vampire fangs.  As another one of my friends so eloquently put it "Your wierd, your wierd, nice couple...la la la la la"  Yeah he's pretty freaky too.  But who could blame him.  He was in the presence of something far more potent that the strongest car freshener.  In the light of the coming mullet warriors i christen this blog with beer in hopes that my actions of faith will not go unnoticed on the day of the return of the mulletitans.  Until then be wary what you say...and...brush your teeth.

       well to all my exquisetly loyal readers out there i have been in Brazil for a month.  So that was the reason for the lull.  Not that you really care.  even if you ever did accidentally stumble upon this you probably gave up by now.        have you ever thought what it would look like from God's pespective up there.  I'll bet he has a panel of buttons.  some for the sun, some for the moon, and one big red one entitled "SMITE"  that would be a cool way to live.  Franky is walking down the street.  He hits his toe on a piece of poorly poured concrete.  He mumbles behind his teeth "dam"  then suddenly before he can take another step  SMITE!   and blam franky is a pile of chalky substance on the cratered sidewalk.  That could make life pretty good.  you would be sitting at your office for example and you would see someone running down the hall with their hands over their head screaming "crap no i'm sorry, i'm sorry i didn't mean it it just slipp SMITE! "  a crash and tearing as the ceiling is ripped open and heavenly flames dash a hole through the side of the building.  Wow.  No that is not the way God works.  But for writing this i just might ge SMITE!
