       Hello my name is patti. now i no if u wanted to no about me u could alsways just go to my profile...but i thought that if u really wanted to no me this is ur chance right here right now.  i live in Guelph Ontario, but i was born in Toronto. i live with my mom and my two sisters, Megan(18) and Jaclyn(10), and my dog BJ. i am 13 years old right now and i will be attending GCVI in the spring.  i absolutely love to play sports. i play soccer and i do dance(jazz and hiphop). in grade 8 i made every single sports team there was to make. i also love music. i play the guitar, piano and saxophone. i also like listening to music. i basically like any type of music other then rap. i hate rap! i also love animals, i want to be a vet when im older. i also love kids. through the summer im going to be a LIT(leader in training) and a day camp in the neighbourhood. i am really into volunteering aswell. i volunteer for everything in school and around my neighbourhood. my fav. subject in school is gym! of course! i also like math,music and science(depending on what section of it).   so i think that is basically me. no that u no more about me i think that i will be able to express my self more clearly and u will understand what im talking about better.

       I have so many feelings mixed up in my head right now. I recently lost my dad to a sudden heart attack. it has been really hard for me latley. alot of the reason i think is that i was there and i saw him die right infront of me.   we went away skiing for the weekend everyone in my family but my older sister and we hadn't even been there a hole day yet. my mom and her friend went shopping for the afternoon and my little sister, my dad and me went skiing. we weren't really experienced skiers, my sister and i only went on school trips before and my dad had never done it before so we went done a couple of times while waiting for lessons to begin.when we went to sit down for a brake a few minutes before our lessons my dad missed the chair. he said that his arm was hurting and that he felt dizzy. the ski patrolers came over to see what was wrong and then my dad went unconsious. all i remember thinking was i have to be strong i have to be strong for jackie(my little sister)i thought to my self that if i start to cry she will really think that something is wrong and will freak out so i have to stay strong. i new something was really wrong when people took me and my sister aside and called our mom.then they said the ambulance was on it's way.  now i have so many mixed feelings it's unbarable. i don't think i could have made it this far with out my awesome friends through the hard times(laura, trisha, ahsley...etc) thnx u guys i luv u all sooooooo much for ur help!  for anyone else out there going through a hard time i no how ur feeling and believe me it helps when u talk to someone or wite or type like what im doing,u may think it's a dumb thing to do but it really really helps.

       today i made a new goal. it is to write in here once a week to say what happened during my week. on the weekend i went to help my cousins clean a town house and i didn't help with the cleaning to much. it was raining that day and all the kids went out and played soccer on a basketball court in the rain lol that sounds extremely confusing. yesturday was pretty boring. the most exciting thing was going golfing. not miniput golfing. i went with an old friend (wouldn't say she is very close though lol)any ways it was only my 2nd time golfing and she goes like every week and i didn't loose by that much, and ya that was aobut it for that day. today my cousins came over here(same ones as on the weekend) adn we just played all day and thats about it. my lil sis got like jurt a bunch of times and now has a brace on her wrist and a goose egg on her forhead lol but what can ya do??
