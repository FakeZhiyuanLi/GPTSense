      was just listening to george michael's last album patience. felt sad when i read some time back that this was going to be his last album. in my eyes he definitely was going to be as big as michael jackson, if not bigger, till he announced he was gay. his music though remained largely unaffected by the decrease in his popularity. it was just as sublime as always. some artists soothe your heart and pump you up at the same time. U2, george micheal are of the highest pedigree indeed.

      my cycling trip went great. ashish d joined us too. we cycled about 18 miles total and went to this place called delhi park. was an awesome nature trail. will put up some snaps soon. my ass is paining since then. nikhil j and i came to a conclusion that the National Science Foundation should fund a project to improve the comfort level of cycle seats. oh, i mean how ppl like lance armstrong spend half their life on seats like that is beyond me.

      ah...its weekend at last. sometimes i hate the way i look forward to saturdays. they are just so enticing. and as long as i can remember, sunday evening gives me the worst blues. today i am going to a 3 hr cycling trip with nikhil j, nikhil m, rahul and harry. i have been an active preacher of the damage caused by cycling (impotency for one), but i know that my virility is too good to be affected by things like this. so what the hell!! also just paid my credit card bills from india and have come to the conclusion that bombay is not a place where i can afford to stay. i mean 400 Rs. for a meal for two, thats close to extortion. But while i am whining, i will admit that i had the most amazing time, thanks largely to natasha who despite her work, managed to find a lot of time for me. love you girl, and the time that i spent with u was absolutely priceless.

      for those of u who haven't been initiated to the world of dilbert, go to www.dilbert.com. Its a classic strip, filled with cynicism and is a total management basher. infact i will admit that whatever lessons i got in management were due to scott adams and his books. no wonder i chose not to enter the management fray. lol. the point of the matter is, the charachters in the strip are well chosen. it takes some time to get used to the setting, but trust me, is more than worth it. i heard scott adams is in the MENSA list of celebrities with highest iq. and i will say it shows. some interesting tidbits on celebrities can be found at talentdevelop.com/gtcelebs.html cartoons can be an excellent source of amusement, calvin and hobbes (i primarily got hooked on to it because of natasha's choice), garfield, dilbert etc. it was unnerving to see 'Unbreakable' show the other side of it. Manoj N. Shymalan is a true genius.

      just an amusing point of view. if u ever go to timesofindia.com, chances are that the first page photo will be some skimpily clad model in some godforsaken fashion show in guatemala. or some sexy babe watching a game at the wimbledon. its just funny how times of india online version misses the sporting event conveniently and focuses on the skin show happening at the event. i used to be scandalized at reading the last article on page one, till i went to india and saw that the actual paper still has the same look. no raunchy photos ( that is still the prerogative of bombay times page 3), no scandalizing issues (like how missionary position is favoured in india compared to doggy style in europe), i mean let vogue and cosmopolitan do their job. times of india is better at covering mudslinging going on in delhi.

      was reading an article the other day on netscape. it was about why guys love talking about sports with each other so much. the study concluded that being knowledgeable in sports gives guys a feeling of strength, no not physical, but a feeling of mental strength(!!!) whatever that means. but i guess everyone wud agree that w/o sports our life wudn't have been the same.  while i am at sports i will say that euro 2004 is turning out to be a damp squib as far as goals scored are concerned. i mean most matches are like 1-0, 0-0, hell germany had a draw with latvia!!! that too 0-0. i am sooo bored. w/o brazil life isn't the same. enuf rambling for the day...my favs for the euro 2004 are hmmmm its hard to say. my heart lies with italy. but i know they are having a tough time qualifying. chritian vieri is such a m@#$%^f#$%^. i hate him. i hope they win though. and i hope france loses badly. real badly.ciao..

      I will be the first one to admit, this blog is created so that I can post comments on a friend's blog. Hell, I don't even have a homepage...so u see, i am not very enthusiastic about cyber life. Thought i hope this will be a great experience.  Just getting over the hibernation of basketball for the next six months . But what an awesome way for it to end, the detroit pistons crowned the NBA champs. Deservedly so. And for once ending the domination of west coast. It feels so nice when everything is in its place...

      Almost done at last. It seems possible that we will finish this off tommorrow. After a gazillion trips from my old house to new, we finally managed to take a major part of our stuff, and yes, quite a lot of stuff ended up in the dumpster.   The night is quite interesting, I might add. Two plans are developing. Nikhil and Co. want to see a movie (mostly 'Village') and then we can always watch 'Bourne Supremacy'. The second plan is Necto. They are having a two year bash today, and we got free tickets last week, so that seems enticing as well. Lets see which way my vote swings...

      As rd christened my moving process..  I was bored even before i started, so now i am more bored (if that was possible).  There is a lot of work to be done, so I better not waste time blogging.  On the brighter side, my bed and desk are in the new house, I just need to assemble them. Back to work again....

      So, I have decided to blog even more frequently when I am moving. Its impossible (actually difficult) to move everything (furniture, clothes etc) in one go. So we are taking it room by room. Just finished the furniture in the hall (2 couches, one lazy chair, a small desk). The new house is nice, but I don't want to leave my old house. I think it will take me some days to call my new place my home.   I am most concerned about the phone. Its sort of my lifeline and a good way of contact with Natasha, which I use frequently. Apart from that, shifting the utilities don't bother me so much. And I am most concerned about the two huge steel tables which weigh one ton each. No, I am not kidding, really, they are very heavy. And last time I lifted them, I ended up with severe stomach ache for the whole night.

      No, I don't have anything exciting planned as the title may suggest. It's quite the contrary. This weekend is the moving weekend for me and my roommates, we are going to leave our house for two years, the house that we have called home since we came here, the house where all our memories of US started.   More than the senti stuff, I am sad about having to do all the physical labor of shifting the couches and tables and all that we gathered over the past two years. Its such a pain. Nooooooo. Just the thought bores me to death.  So maybe this time I will have a valid reason to not post over the weekend. Hey- you  can't do both- blog as well as move.   Whats the consolation?? Maybe I will go and see whats new in the life of Jason Bourne, and yes, how can I forget, 'The Village' opens.....TODAY!!

      Song- You spin me right round baby(like a record) Year-1984.  Band- Dead or Alive. This song totally spins me round. What amazing lyrics, who can think of an analogy of a girl spinning you around 'like a record', its just pure thrill. And as if the lyrics are ordinary, its backed by excellent dance music making it one of the hottest dance tracks around.   Well I...I set my sights on you (and no one else will do) And I, I've got to have my way now, baby (and no one else will do) And I, I've got to have my way now, baby All I know is that to me You look like you're havin' fun Open up your lovin' arms Watch out, here I come   awesome stuff. Sometimes these retropicks make an amazing listen. If you are in India, I will suggest get this song from Kazaa. If you are in US, better not try that and U of M, don't even think about. RIAA has already busted three students here.   My credit cards have been lying around of late, gathering dust. I can't even remember the last item for personal use that I shopped for. No clothes, nothing for the past two months. Eeeks, thats pretty scary. On a logical note: I need to get more hangers before I get more clothes.

      It was good fun playing frisbee in the rain yesterday. You hardly get tired. Even after two hours of play we could easily have played an hour or so more. The flipside being-cramps. In slightly cold weather, you don't realize that you have sweated a lot. Result- You drink less water and bingo, you get cramps. This game is turning out to be a lot more fun than what I had expected. Wow. Saw a little bit of Hyderabad Blues 2 yesterday and hated whatever I saw. I mean it just shows how indecisive a person can be. Nagesh K. needs to be hanged for dishing out such a torture. And Jammy needs to be crucified for making us see it over dinner.  For the first time, I sat down yesterday and watched 'Sex and the City'. I just wanted to know why people like idle ramblings of NYC women about sex and fashion. I have made a mental note to see it more often, till I form a definitive opinion of whether I like it or not.

      This post was once mailed to me by a friend Aditya from Syracuse. I normally like these kind of interesting things. They are funny and totally useless. Have fun.  If you yelled for 8 years,7 months and 6 days you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it)  If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it)  The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 feet. (Oh my God...!)  A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes. (In my next life I want to be a pig)  A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it starves to death. (Creepy.) (I'm still not over the pig)  Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (Do not try this at home .. maybe at work)  The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off. ("Honey, I'm home. What the....")  The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a human jumping the length of a football field. (30 minutes...can you imagine??)  The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds. (What can be so tasty on the bottom of the pond?)  Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (I still want to be a pig in my next life ... quality over quantity.)  Butterflies taste with their feet. (Something I always wanted to know)  The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue. (Hmmmmmm........)  Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do. (If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)  Elephants are the only animal that cannot jump. (OK, so that would be a good thing....)  A cat's urine glows under a blacklight. (I wonder who was paid to figure that out.)  An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain. (I know some people like that.)  Starfish have no brains. (I know some people like that too.)  Polar bears are left-handed. (Who knew...? Who cares! )  Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure. (What about the pig?)

      Deep in the bosom of the gentle night Is when I search for the light Pick up my pen and start to write I struggle, fight dark forces In the clear moon light Without fear... insomnia I can't get no sleep  Insomnia, I heard this song for the first time when I was in maybe 11-12 std. Its a nice trance track. The reason why i thought of this yesterday is because- yes, you guessed it right, I am having problems sleeping of late. lol.   The end results is i get up all groggy eyed. I hate this scenario, hopefully it will go away after a few days.   Work seems to be taking shape again after the contract extension-priorities redefining and stuff like that. So thats neat. It's drizzling in Ann Arbor, and that sucks. I hate it when it rains in summer. For someone coming from a place like Bombay, I am used to seeing precipitation only during four months and not year round, as it happens here.   I hope frisbee game is on today.

      So finally the much awaited moment arrived yesterday afternoon, when i was supposed to go to the Thai Restaurant and savour the food. I don't know whats with the Thai fetish- I can assure you that the fetish is restricted only to food :-), but I just felt like having it. Anyways, we drove to the place and surprise of surprise, Sunday afternoon, the place is closed. Was bitterly disappointed. So we went to a place called Macaroni Grill, as the name suggests, an Italian place. It was unique in many ways, but I loved their Caffe Latte Cheesecake the most. Was really nice. For someone who likes coffee and cheesecakes, life can't get better than that. Football season is rolling around the corner and I am excited. There is no better way to spend saturdays and sundays than to sit on a couch and watch the games. Well, thats if you are not married/don't have your gf around :-) But seriously, its going to be one helluva five months.

      Saw Bad Boys-2 last night. I know i know, it released a long time back, but somehow had missed it. I like the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence partnership. They both are so cool. Kevin Bacon anyone?? I think he is very sexy. I really like his quiet style. Seen 'Mystic River'? I thought Sean Penn did a nice job as well. A good movie, but i hated the ending. I absolutely hated it, so much so that I left the theatre fuming.  Ah-well, thinking of that movie spoiled my mood again. Bollocks.

      Just decided to forego a night at Club Divine to staying at home. Frankly, am in no physical condition to go anywhere. Played soccer in the evening and that has caused some pain in my knees. It always gets better when I sleep. I think its pretty funny-almost like a self recuperating system. Neways, so long as it gets better :-) Manoj Shymalan's 'Village' is releasing on July 30 and I can't wait to see it. I like his movies-its like, you have to be patient for the entire movie but then all loose threads are connected at the end and a unifying theme emerges. Very nice style. Also, I read on CNN Money that Apple Inc. is slashing their prices for Regular Ipod by almost a 100$ each. So a 20 gig Ipod will be 299$ and 40 gig for 399$. Now, that's pretty irresistible. But hey, can anyone tell me when??

      Recently, Sid and I have been going to a Thai Restaurant in Ann arbor called Tup Tim after our frisbee games and having a Thai Iced Tea/Coffee. Hey, after so much running, you do deserve a nice cool drink. Whats funny is that we normally walk in all drenched in sweat from head to toe (and i am not exaggerating) and then take our carry out while the people sitting and enjoying their meal are amused.  When I was in Bombay, I once had Paneer Satay with Natasha in one of my favourite places called Sun Moon and Potatoes in Malad. Well, the place has deteriorated quite a bit, but thats another story. Their portions are really generous and the satay was really nice with that wonderful peanut chutney. I remember we liked it so much, we had two plates of satay and then a main course dish. Needless to say we didn't finish it. But then, what's a doggie bag for??

      Some Calvin and Hobbes fans might find this interesting...  Courtesy: Dave, davescoolwebpage.com  Why did Bill Watterson quit making Calvin and Hobbes?  Bill Watterson stoped making Calvin and Hobbes for the newspapers on December 31, 1995. He eventually published his last book in 1996.  The main reason for this was the constant pressure to have a new strip 6 days a week. Another reason was being required to follow the stupid panel rules for newspaper comics. (Until relatively recently, the divisions between each part of a comic were mandatory.)  The best person to explain this would be Bill Watterson himself. The following is a letter from 1995 that was sent to the editors of all the papers that caried the strip:  Dear Editor:  I will be stopping Calvin and Hobbes at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.  That so many newspapers would carry Calvin and Hobbes is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.  Sincerely, Bill Watterson

      Yesterday, I realized blogging is not for me. I have seen people blog for a couple of years now and frankly i don't know how. I will tell you what my problem is. I don't like to talk about my daily schedule, nor my work or thoughts. I think all these things will bore the reader.I have seen that my blogs are increasingly about music and sports. Ah well... is there anything as a blogger's block? I think what's undecided in my mind is 'How personal do I want this thing to be?'I don't know. I don't think I have been able to find a right balance.  But at the same time, whatever short span I have been blogging, this thing has become a little part of my life. Its just a nice space on the web where I can write something  and people who know about it can read. Its too tough to let go of it.  Anyways- whats hot:Lance, for Tour de France and his role in 'Dodgeball'!! (And you thought          Texas only produced Cowboys and dumb presidents) whats not:having to work on beautiful sunny days.

      I can't figure out why I am so lazy about posting over the weekend. I just don't feel like lifting my butt off the couch and going over and typing something.  Had been to Dayton, Ohio on Saturday/Sunday to watch the annual Dayton Air Show. Dayton is the birthplace of aviation, meaning that the Wright brothers hail from Dayton, so everything in Dayton is Wright Avenue, Wright Brothers Park, Wright Laundromat, Wright Car Wash service etc.  The air show was worth it. Got to see some formation routines, some solo acrobatic (or shall i say aerobatic) stunts and some orgasmic sonic flights by FA/18 Hornet and F-16's. Really, I just want to see our Sukhoi in action now. It really is something when you see these fighter planes blast past you. The real show stealer was a truck!! A 3 jet powered (36000hp) truck which can go at 360mph (world record for truck). It was cool. Some good news awaited me when I came to Ann Arbor, that my project contract was extended as we had hoped for. That pretty much takes care of my PhD work. I am really happy, but 'there are miles to go before I sleep'. Breaking the news to Natasha, I felt nice. There's something about telling good news to loved ones, isn't it??

        Played frisbee for a good three hours yesterday. I must thank Sid and Nikhil for introducing me to this game. Seriously the amount of running is such that you will lose 2 pounds in one game. I normally carry a gallon of water (3.9 litres) and drink atleast half of it!!   On the brighter side, my knee held up well yesterday. When I came home, my left leg used to shoot this pain. But it wasn't very serious and I knew it will subside in the morning. So here I am. Also taking X-rays on Wednesday helped, because I was less uncertain about the nature of my injury. It will be a pity if I have to leave this game because of some stupid knee injury.

      Techno is a form of electronic music that emerged in the mid-1980s and primarily refers to a particular style developed in Detroit. It can also refer to a number of more recent offshoots of the original Detroit style such as trance. "Techno" is also sometimes used more generically by those unfamiliar with electronic music to refer to all electronic dance music styles. Techno was primarily developed in basement studios by "The Belleville Three", a cadre of African-American men who were attending college, at the time, near Detroit, Michigan.  For a place like Detroit, thats quite an honour. So why is it that Michigan has very few Techno places now? I was looking in google for a nightclub that plays techno and it is extremely hard to find.  Its sad but true that the techno scene has shifted to Europe. Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Paul van Dyk all from Europe, but all listened to records from Detroit when they grew up.  As if its not bad enough that there are not many techno places, people here don't even appreciate it. How many radio stations do you hear playing good trance? And how many play Hip-Hop? No offense meant to Hip-Hop lovers, but hey how can you lose something that you developed and gave to the world??  My favourite nightclub in Ann Arbor, Necto plays techno every Thursday and it totally kicks ass. They have guest DJ's coming from Europe, guess because there aren't many left in US to scratch that stuff. Thats my only solace. It was heartening to see the amount of people during PvD's show in April. And what a show it was. Its a pity that we don't have it more often.

      I thought this article is quick to read and easy to follow. Those who know me well have seen me sit with an icepack on my knee every alternate day. I thought I will post this, so that people not already warming up before they play start doing so. Don't wait for something to break!! One of the nagging questions for me when it comes to warm up is- How long should you do it?  "IMPORTANCE of WARM-UP AND STRETCHING" By Ahmad Tousi, FIFA Licensed Coach   Warm-up is one of the most important elements of an exercise program. It is particularly important to prevent injury: Warm-up is low level activity, such as a brisk walk or a slow jog, which should be completed prior to stretching and more strenuous exercise. The objective of the warm-up is to raise total body temperature and muscle temperature to prepare the entire body for vigorous activity. The warm-up period prepares the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, nervous system and the musculoskeletal system by gradually increasing the demand on those systems so that they are able to accommodate the demands of more strenuous activity.  Passive Warm-up: The main goal of passive warm-up is to increase body temperature, either total body temperature or local body temperature, without physical activity. In passive warm-up the body temperature is usually increased by some external means, such as wearing heavy apparel, like a sweatshirt, and/or a massage with a topical exercise rub, such as Ben-Gay. One of the advantages of using a passive means of warm-up is that energy is not expended in the warm-up activity. However, for best results it's recommended that passive warm-up be used in combination with active warm-up.  Active warm-up: Is composed of two types: general and sports specific warm-up. The general or non-specific warm-up utilizes low intensity movements such as walking or slow jogging general warm-up, involving low level activity, is usually more effective than passive warm-up in increasing deep muscle temperature. Specific warm-up exercises actually involve the body parts that will be used in the subsequent competitive event. An example would be swinging a tennis racket in a practice stroke. The advantage of the specific warm-up is that the temperature is more effectively increased in the specific body parts that are to be used.  THE PURPOSE OF WARM-UP: PREVENT INJURY - ENHANCE PERFORMANCE Experts agree that the main purpose of warm-up is to increase the blood circulation in order to raise both the general body and the deep muscle temperatures, which in turn help to heat up the muscles, ligaments and tendons in preparation for more vigorous activity. A proper warm-up provide many benefits due to elevated temperatures associated with it. The likelihood of injury is reduced. Athletic performance can be improved. The warm-up increases muscle efficiency, reduces potential for muscle pulls, improves reaction time and improves the speed of movement of muscled and ligaments. Proper warm-up can also help reduce the severity of post-exercise muscle soreness. The higher temperatures and increased blood flow resulting from warm-up are important for delivery of oxygen to the muscles and for prevention of build-up of unwanted waste products which can lead to muscle soreness.  INTENSITY and DURATION of WARM-UP  It is difficult to recommend specific intensity and duration of warm-up for every person, but most research in this area suggests an increase in body and muscle temperature of approximately one to two degrees Fahrenheit to be adequate. A brisk 5-8 minute walk or a slow jog will generally produce sufficient warm-up to prepare the body for more strenuous exercise. The duration and intensity of warm-up should be adjusted according to the environmental temperature and the amount of clothing worn. The higher the environmental temperature and the greater the amount of clothing, the sooner the desired body temperature is attained. It is also important to begin a major activity while still warmed-up. Ideally, the rest period should be more than a few minutes. In any case, no more than fifteen minutes should elapse. When the beneficial effect of warm-up has dissipated, the muscle temperature will have returned to pre-warm-up levels.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WARM-UP and STRETCHING: WARM-UP THEN STRETCH  There is an important difference between warm-up and stretching. Many people stretch and call it warm-up. This is incorrect. It is important to warm-up before stretching. If one stretches the muscles without prior warm-up, the muscles are cold and are more prone to injury, such as muscle tear or strain. Before exercising, begin with a warm-up period to raise the body temperature. You want to get the heart pumping and increase blood flow to the muscles before stretching. Slow running in place, a slow aerobic dance, or a walk-jog (all with ball), and the application of an external exercise rub, is an ideal warm-up regimen to help prepare the muscles for stretching.

      Yesterday I was at Sid D'silvas house frittering time when my eyes fell on apple strudel lying on his table, and I must say it really was awesome. The problem is you have so much snacky stuff in the stores that it is hard to pick anything. Usually, I end up buying a pack of choco chip cookies and some chips at best, but now I have something new to look for. :-) Then I came home after playing volleyball and invented a new snack. Has anyone tried eating pretzel sticks dipped in Priya's Mango Pickle. It tastes very nice. I like pretzels, especially on an airplane. It compliments the cranberry juice that I normally have perfectly. In fact its such a staple diet for me on the aircraft that I never have cranberry juice at home.  But all said and done, this innovation is due to the fact that I don't get my pani puri or pav bhaji. With snacks like these who need pretzels!!

      What does it feel like to be free falling from 420 feet above the ground (roughly equal to a 35 storey building) and reaching speeds of 120 miles/hr (190k/hr)? Well, I experienced that this saturday at cedar point. Ladies and gentlemen-the world's tallest and fastest roller coaster- the Top Thrill Dragster. As if that is not enough, they even have the world's second highest roller coaster, the Millenium Force, and trust me that one rocks too. Cedar point is based very close to Lake Erie. So when you are going down (no pun intended), you can only see the waters of Lake Erie and trust me when I say that your whole life flashes infront of your eyes, in case of the Top Thrill Dragster, many times. And final tidbit, the Top Thrill Dragster accelerates from 0-120 miles/hr in 3 seconds. To give an analogy, thats roughly the same as a F1 car acceleration. Now, how many g forces are we talking about??

      I was reading a book by David Bodanis, on the progress of science from 1850-1950. It was quite interesting to read the phase from 1905, when Einstein first came with his theory of relativity to 1945, when the full power of that theory was realised in the form of an atomic bomb. I would just like to mention a few facts of general interest. Around 1939, Einstein who had taken refuge in America from anti-Jew practices in Germany, sent off a letter to Roosevelt saying that Germany had the capability to develop a very powerful bomb and that America should start thinking of making their own. Response- Roosevelt replied back politely saying that it sounded interesting but it won't be considered. Around same time, Heisenberg (yes, the one with Uncertainity Principle) was fathering german progress. They were miles ahead of America. They controlled Uranium fields in Czech and Belgium, their only problem was -heavy water (dueterium) needed to slow the nuetrons bombarding uranium nucleus. It was scarce. Einstein was never involved in american progress because his loyalty was always doubted. Oppenheimer was the one who looked after the creation of atom bomb. After Pearl Harbour (1941) America started their campaign actively. In a remote Norwegian lake,in 1943, the german supply of heavy water, while being transported to germany was sunk. That is why inspite of the technical prowess the germans could never build a bomb. The rest, as they say, is history. Truman, elected in 1945 would have been crucified if he had chosen not to use a working weapon. Finally what Einstein saw in 1905 was brought to life in 1945.  ps: I don't know whats with the science fixation with me today. But hope you enjoyed the little piece of history.

      I have always found it amazing when I see what I study in my real life. 2 Examples for you to think about  1) Everyone cooks, well almost everyone. Say you want to stir fry something. The first thing you do is pour oil in a fry pan and heat. And since you want to stir fry, the oil layer is not very deep. What do you do next. Catch your favourite TV show till the oil heats? If you do that, you may just miss an interesting phenomenon happening in the pan. As the oil close to the pan heats up, its density reduces and it tries to go up. The oil layer on top is not as hot and it becomes relatively denser and moves down towards the pan. This motion of oil creates steady convection roll cells, the magic being the shape of the cells. They are hexagonal!! Its so much fun to see them. This instability was discovered by Lord Rayleigh and is known as Rayleigh Bernard Instability. 2) Ever held a spoon under the tap. Suspend it vertically such as the bottom of the spoon (the part that touches your lower lips), touches the stream of water, and the part of spoon that touches your upper lips is away from the stream. What happens? Two things-first you will see water stream following the bottom part of spoon instead of falling straight down. Coanda Effect-courtesy Henry Coanda. Second, if you are suspending the spoon in your hand, you will feel a lateral(horizontal) force acting on it. This effect is not because of surface tension. And this is what happens when air flows over the wings of the plane. If water weren't following the spoon (if air wasn't following the wing), then we would have no force on the hand ( we would have no lift!!!)     Life is so beautiful when you can explain everything, isn't it?

      I am normally not the one who puts up personal posts, but today I make an exception. 8 July, 2000 was the day I told Natasha that I love her. It has been four years since. I am just glad that I could muster the courage to tell her that. A few months later, she said that she loved me too! And life has been much better after that. She has been such a great support and friend for me. Love you my girl!

      Butterflies taste with their feet. (won't that affect the taste of things?)  A duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why.  (thank god, bearing it once is bad enough)  In 10 minutes, a hurricane releases more energy than all the world's nuclear weapons combined. (but it can't be controlled)  On average, 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year. (duh!)  On average people fear spiders more than they do death. (that doesn't explain spiderman's record sales)  Ninety percent of New York City cabbies are recently arrived immigrants. (aha, and we all know where they come from!!)   The Main Library at Indiana University sinks over an inch every year because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. (duh-er)   Thirty-five percent of the people who use personal ads for dating are already married. (that's sick)  Elephants are the only animals that can't jump. (lemme me guess why...hmmm...why are all the high jump participants thin??...how about... WEIGHT?)  Only one person in two billion will live to be 116 or older. (And I don't want to be him)  It's possible to lead a cow upstairs...but not downstairs. (thats funny, what if the slaughterhouse is in the basement??)  Women blink nearly twice as much as men. (but wink only as half..)  A snail can sleep for three years. (what luck)  No word in the English language rhymes with "MONTH".

      RECIPE for a Marilyn Manson: Take one music journalist from Ohio and add one part sex kitten, one part serial killer. Mix well. Slowly fold in some KISS, Alice Cooper, power chords, Trent Reznor, occultism, and Dr. Seuss. Season with one hell of a marketing campaign. Cover, let simmer, and ladle over the youth of America. Serves four million. Love him or hate him, but you can't ignore him. Marilyn is easily the most hated rock star in america. It is justified to call him a 'star'. Over the past decade his album sales haven't been phenomenal, but his popularity (or notoreity, whichever way u look at it) has been noteworthy. His lyrics (like "don't discriminate, hate every m*&^#$f@#$%") are very loud. Its amazing how a single human being has the capacity to hate almost everything on this planet. But hey, that's what death metal is about. In 94, he opened for Nine Inch Nails, another terrific industrial rock band, again from ohio, and did some nasty things. He tore the book of mormon on stage and was named the 'reverend' of the church of satan. His antichrist feelings were never concealed, thus invoking the ire of millions. He is said to have cut last two sets of his ribs so that he can give himself a fellatio. Talk about being different. Admiringly though, inspite of all the negative publicity, he never strayed away from doing what he does best- hate. His music has all the essential elements of a good rock band. Good bass and drumming. His shows are quite breathtaking. He once used a 6 year old caged boy as a prop. It is important to realize though that he 'puts up a show', that in reality he wouldn't hurt anyone. Its like the difference between a porn and a snuff film. Manson is not snuff.  Personally, I like his music for the same reason as I like rock. It gives me a way to vent my fury without throwing things around. Its not everyday that you listen to Manson. No. Only when you feel like ripping the world apart, thats when Manson helps you.

      Watersports are among the best things in life. They come in all shapes and sizes. Leisure? Try canoeing or sailing in a yatch or a catamaran. Want to be close to nature? How about snorkeling or scuba diving. If some adrenaline rush is the order of the day, then go rafting or jetskiing. Personally I adore rafting. I am a certfied rafter, so I can take on professional courses!!There are very few things in the world that give you a high as the sight of an approaching rapid does. Just feel like grabbing the bull by its horns.  When I had been to Florida, we went snorkeling and parasailing. It took a few minutes to get the hang of it, but was awesome fun. One of the things that I feel I should try but don't know how - surfing. I think it must be great fun. But all good things come at a price. In India these things, if available are very inexpensive, in US, I think they cost quite a bit. Be ready to shell the dough!

      has been some time since i posted on the blog. just was very busy with my work and didn't find much time to write anything. spiderman-2 is the next big thing coming up. reviews have been fabulous. and how did i forget the fourth of july weekend!! have got quite some plans lined up, lets see how each of them materializes. talking of spiderman, i have to mention about the ride at Universal Studio, Orlando. It's a 3D-simulation ride. So you and a few more people sit in a van and wear suspicious looking dark colored shades. The story is like you are the journalists travelling in a van covering the activities of spiderman. The van is moving on tracks and spiderman and all other charachters are created by laser, just that they are 3 D!! So unfortunately you get caught in the fight, and the evil souls(all 3D laser created charachters) try to douse you with water (and you actually are sprayed with water) and burn you with fire (u feel the heat), though not specifically in that order :-). and finally your van falls from the top of a building. simulation-zero gravity effect. absolutely awesome. and spiderman catches you in his web. So everything except you and the van are laser created. Was undoubtedly the best ride that i have ever been to. If this sounds like fun, then there are a handful other rides like this. Was a good theme park to visit. And if that was not enough, there always is a NBA restaurant and a hard rock cafe inside!!

      Train spotting is a pastime practised largely in the UK (and possibly elsewhere) in which enthusiasts spend time at railway depots, train stations or at trackside vantage points noting down serial numbers of passing trains and locomotives.  The aim of these hobbyists is to see all of the locomotives and perhaps coaching stock and multiple units (coaches with motive power as well as passenger seating) in the country. To this end, they collect and exchange detailed information about the movements of locomotives and other equipment on the railway network, and become very knowledgable about its operations.   Trainspotting is a movie by Danny Boyle, based on a book by Irvine Welsh of the same name. It sparked controversy in US and UK on its release as to whether it promoted drug use.   "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a fucking big television.Choose leisurewear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats that you've spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your future. Choose life... But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose life. I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"- Mark Renton  It deals with some rough subjects - hard drug use, HIV, premature death, theft, bloodshed. But the movie in a great sense is about the attempts of one main character to go straight and "choose life", but his 4 dastardly friends end up making that very, very difficult.  Certain scenes for which you really have to have the sickest sense of humor to appreciate-  -when he ends up in the "worst toilet in scotland" and drops his suppositories in the bowl and has to retrieve them -when the barely year old baby dies because someone gives her heroin. -when Renton has sex with a girl he meets at a bar and then in the morning, sees her dressed in a school uniform (she is ~ 16 yrs old). He even drops her to her school.  Its hard to discern where the story is going- what with all the shit happening in the lives of the friends. You have to see it, its definitely worth a watch.   It amuses me sometimes, how drugs make someone so immune to their surroundings...  PS: Guys who are lucky enough to be at home at 1745 GMT pls, switch on ur TV's and watch the 200m freestyle final between Michael Phelps and Ian Thorpe!!!

      1) Real Madrid signing of Michael Owen. Dude, they have a 'Michigan 1902-point a minute' offense, maybe even better. And thank god for Carlos Queiroz's ass being hauled out of Santiago Bernabeu. Pathetic man lived up to his expectations and thanks for giving us such a disappointing season. And while I am at it, can the price of their jerseys go a bit down. 80 euros is way too much.  2) Cramps galore at frisbee yesterday. Was about 14 c yesterday evening. So much so for the 2 months of summer. People played without drinking water and fell down with cramps. Luckily for me I sweated and that is a good indication that I need to drink water. But its awesome, you just never get tired till you stop.  3) For people cooking okra off frozen packs and pissed with the sticky vegetable due to the wet okra after thawing, here is a tip. Put potato in, that absorbs all the stickiness and tastes great and the okra stays nice and crisp. Plus the quantity increases!! Everyone knows how deceitful okra is. 500gms is sufficent for exactly 2 people!!  4)Normal is boring- So do something different today. Like take a diff route back home. If it doesn't work well, you can always blame it on Friday the 13.

      Scattered Thunderstorms: Its funny when I get this message everyday before I leave my house in the morning expecting some ...well..thunder, but don't hear anything, except the occasional grumbling from my stomach, because I invariably miss breakfast. I have heard it rains like crazy down south, but here in midwest, even an ocassional scatter of rain is sufficient to send people scuttling for cover. I had this very strong urge to break the 'Severe Weather Cabinet' located in my office and peek inside and see what can save my life in the toughest of weather conditions, till the maintainence supervisor told me " Ah-well, its nothing but an umbrella and a towel in case it rains" !!!!! Hello, I mean is this supposed to be a joke? At a place where winter temperatures go to 0 F (or about -20 c), I would rather that the 'Severe weather Cabinet' had something more like a fur jacket or a bottle of vodka. And if its below 0 Celcius for more than 6 months, then its not likely to RAIN for 6 months, isn't it? To make matters even more ridiculous, the yearly downpour is 646 mm in Ann Arbor compared to 2167 mm in Bombay. Looks like a comparison of dog's pee to the water hose to me. I don't understand, and we are among the top 5 engineering schools in the country. Obviously common sense is not that common.  Another farce- tornado warning. I am sick of those people at the weather bureau having some fun at my expense. I am pretty sure the conversation goes like this..  Weather man #1: Hey you know what, my wife wants to go to a mall this saturday and buy some jewellery from J.B. Robinson. I just want to stay at home and watch the Ohio State- Michigan game. Just don't know how I can turn her down.  'Smart' Weather man#2: You owe me one pal, lets issue a tornado warning for saturday. That way you 'will' have to stay at home.   'Smarter' Weather man#3: How about a tornado and a scattered thunderstorm warning?? That way I won't have to do the yardwork that I was supposed to.   I know, it sounds a bit fat fetched, but considering that I have witnessed at least a dozen tornado warnings last year but none of them happened to be anything more turbulent than an elephants' fart, I am pretty sure thats the origin of tornadoes and not some stupid low pressure region as they teach us in elementary school.  And yes, I want to see a full blown tornado, where the fury of nature is unleashed on us poor mortals. Thats what makes it even more frustrating when they don't happen.

      “I don’t want to end up rich and alone.” (Eminem)  On October 17, 1974 Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born in Kansas City. He was born to Debbie Mathers, who was going to be a single mother. His family was constantly moving back and forth between Kansas City and Metro Detroit. From ages 1 to 5 he lived in Detroit, then in Kansas from ages 5 to 9. The family settled in East Detroit when Marshall was 12. Growing up in a mostly black neighborhood, Marshall always had a love for hip hop.  Living in a high crime area, two incidents that Marshall based his music on were the time that he returned the finger to a car full of passing kids, who then stripped him of his clothes and pointed a gun at him. Another was when he introduced a childhood friend, MC Poof to a white neighborhood, and they challenged his right to be there, and subsequently fired at both boys with a gun. Those were major turning points in his life and he based several songs on those experiences which are so cruel, but so true of life today.  Mathers dropped out of school and landed several minimum wage paying, full time jobs. Through it all his musical focus remained constant. Mathers, aka Eminem, was discovered at age 14 by a pair of Detroit producers who call themselves Funky Bass Team. The two name songs that put Mathers on the right tract were Fucking Bastard and Biterphobia.  The album finally got recognition though with songs such as Murder Murder, No Ones Iller, and Low Down Dirty. The album sold so well that the record company at the time Web Entertainment, had to order thousands more copies. Mathers then needed an alias, which then became Slim Shady, Eminem. Eminem finally got connected with Dr.Dre in 1998. Dre saw his demo tape, listened to it, and liked it. He was signed to Dre's Aftermath label in January of 1998. The Slim Shady LP went Triple Platinum.   After fame and stardom caught up with him, so did litigations from his mother for his lyrics against her. His wife tried commiting suicide and ended up spending 30 days in jail. Not even his worst enemies would deny the love Eminem feels for his little daughter. Hailie Jade is the best gift life has given to him and he wants to be the best father for her.It is even known that Eminem did anything possible to go home early after the 8 Mile Premiere. He wanted to be able to drive Hailie at school next morning.Eminem has battled to reunite his family.  I feel Eminem is still in his prime.  Some think his popularity is running short, but from learning about his past and realizing he will never give up, the great days for Eminem are just beginning.  Like stated above, he debuted in his first staring role as an actor on 8 Mile, which was a very successful film.  If you want to learn more about Eminem, this is the movie to see, because it is “close to” his actual life story.  He has also, just recently, started his own record label, and signed one of today’s biggest rappers, 50 Cent.  Eminem has had kind of a rough life, and I think he tries to explain that through most of his lyrics.  Maybe that’s why he’s so popular.  A lot of people can probably relate to them.  Anyway, I think the young, white rapper is moving in the right direction.    I won't even go into the beauty of his songs, it will require another post in itself.  And by the way, if you haven't seen 8 mile, then you should. Its a really nice film.  No more games, I'ma change what you call rage  Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged  I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed  I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher  Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper All the pain inside amplified by the fact  That I can't get by with my 9 to 5  And I can't provide the right type of life for my family  Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers  And it's no movie, there's no Makai Pfeiffer, this is my life  And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder  Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus  Teeter-totter caught up between trying to be a father and a pre-madonna  Baby mama drama's screamin on and  Too much for me to wanna  Stay in one spot, another jam or not  Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail  I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot  Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not  Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go  I cannot grow old in Salem's lot  So here I go is my shot. Feet fail me not or not this may be the only opportunity that I got  This part of song from 'Lose Yourself' pretty much sums up his state of mind...

      Blogspot has been giving me some problems logging in. Any one else experiencing the same problems??  August 15 is drawing near and this time fortunately it happens to be on a Sunday. I love August 15s. Every one comes to our Central Diag (As the name suggests, it is located at a prime spot and has a lot of paths leading from it towards various department buildings) for flag hoisting and a very small speech (yes, it is very small) by the invited guest. People wear traditional clothes and generally have a good time meeting aquaintances. Then our group of friends go out for lunch at an Indian Restaurant which is very full. Being a Sunday, the next thing on the agenda is- afternoon nap.   The location for the hoisting is also fixed because on the Central Diag is a very tall pole (~200 feet) which has the american flag on it, and apparently if you have to hoist a foreign country flag on american soil, there should be an american flag close by, and that american flag should be at a height greater than the foreign country flag.   My first archival paper was accepted into the Journal of Tribology yesterday. Its really good to have an archival publication, especially since in my field of study they are valued much more than conference papers/proceedings. For the uninitiated, Tribology means the study of three disciplines related to friction and wear. First one is Fluid Mechanics (which happens to be my specialization and my paper is based on that) to study lubrication. Second-Solid Mechanics, to study the nature of forces acting on objects under consideration. Third- Material Sciences, to study properties of friction materials.  A copy of almost the same paper that I will also be presenting at a conference in Long Beach in October can be found at http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~schultz/Manuscripts/AphaleCho04.pdf   Just the abstract and the introduction should give you a good idea of what my work is all about!!

      This weekend the five of us Sid, Monto, Nikhil M, Kedar and I had gone to Indian Lake State Park for camping. We had an awesome time, what with all the things to eat and drink, frisbee, swimming in the lake and some more food.   We reached there Saturady evening around 7, pitches our tents and after a brief stroll at the lake, got down to lighting the fire and cooking food. The chicken, paneer and potatoes turned out great. There was so much snacky stuff, that by the time we got to eating the main food, we were half full. But the left overs served us well the next day morning for breakfast.   We played frisbee in the lake for quite some time and then decided to leave around 2:30 ish. Got back home around 5:30 which was cool, since we got the evening to spare.  It was pretty good fun, my first camping in US, I will come up with a detailed post on that one later. Will post some pictures (we didn't take many) soon..

      I am really pissed at SBC right now. They said my phone conn will be installed on Wednesday, and that didn't happen, so I called them and asked whats up. They said that it shud be up and working now. Now there is some problem with the main telephone console for which their guys will have to visit and fix, till tomm evening. And at the end of every conversation that stupid woman asks if I am satisfied with the service, i mean, is it supposed to be a joke, of course i don't give a fuck about the company, just get my goddamn line connected.  Neways, I plan to get a cell, though am not sure if I will use it or not. But thought WTF, its been two yrs since I am in US, might as well get connected with some old buds.   Lost in the intramural volleyball finals today for second consecutive year. Maybe we should borrow the 'chokers' tag from ganguly and co.  Sometimes I feel what am I doing here? When I should really be with people I love. Is it worth it all? I don't know, hopefully one day I will have an answer .  They are playing the song 'Turn me On' by Kevin Lyttle right now on TV. Babi, I miss you so much when I hear this song. I always think of our night in the Hawaiian Shack ;-)Had so much fun that night!!

      Sidharth Sivasailam on his blog 'sidharths.com' talks about a unique story of a person from IBM who pioneered Dynamic Instruction Scheduling (???). The story is not about his struggles at work, but struggles in life. I was even more surprised at the person's current location. Definitely a must read.   Yesterday , after quite some time went to the recreation building. Have been avoiding going there since I play outdoors for these four months. Played racketball with monto among other things and strengthened  my belief that squash is a better sport. But somehow noone here plays squash, so end up playing racketball.   Anyways, the point of the matter is, I stepped on the weighing scale for the second time since I came back from India. And voila, I am ten pounds lighter!! Thanks to frisbee, but 10 pounds in 2 months and I am mightily pleased with myself.

      1) Spent almost the entire day polishing a word document which had objects from Excel, Powerpoint, Microsoft Equation Editor, Tecplot, Digital Photographs etc. And I can't tell you how irritated I am. For all these years at Umich, I consciously stayed away from LaTeX, because I always found a smart ass who said "Chinar, there is no real need to learn LaTeX. Whatever u can do with LaTeX u can do with word also, like figure referencing blah blah" Has anyone here imported an excel figure into word and seen right before his/her eyes how distorted it gets. Then you spend the next 2-3 minutes mending it. This is a very painful procedure if your document has ~ 45 figures. So, the mental note: Learn LaTeX in the next month or so- well thats if its going to solve my problem.   2) Does any one here procrastinate with the administrative aspect of their work? I find the process of going to the secretary and then finding out that she is not the one but some other old white fat lady in another building at the other end of the campus 'might' help me, very boring. Result: I never bother going to her, unless and until it is about my paycheck ;-) which they haven't screwed up...yet. And please don't say 'Phone and ask'. For quick action, its always better to pay them a visit. If something doesn't get done infront of you, then probably it doesn't get done at all. Note: Persist, even if it takes a lot of your time.  Saw Bourne Supremacy yesterday. Is a good flick, action packed and fast moving. You won't be disappointed, even more so if you like Matt Damon. Some parts of the film are shot in Goa, India.   M. Night Shyamalan this time uses a love story to deliver his message of facing your fears and does an excellent job of it. Its a very nice story woven around innocent people living in a village. As always there is a twist in the end that makes the entire movie realizable. Definitely, a must see.
