						   What yesterday seemed so catastrophic, today is relegated to past fears.  What I once thought the end of the world was really the beginning.  As T. S. Eliot says:  What we often call the beginning is really the end To make an end is to make a beginning The end is where we start from              (Little Gidding)

						   I finally got a job.  Not the one I was hoping for, obviously, but a good job I will be able to enjoy: delivering flowers.  I'll be a delivery boy for a flower shop here in Chico full-time starting in August (not sure exact days/times yet, but they are coming).  I'm working tomorrow as well.

						   What a concert last night!&nbsp; He sang old and new favorites for 2 hours that seemed like only 1 because it was such a high-energy, fast-paced concert!  He sang two of my all-time favorites last night:  Yoda , and  Melanie.&nbsp;  All the songs though were top-notch, and were recording quality!&nbsp; There were no flaws to his performance!  What a great time: hundreds of people of ALL ages coming together to hear the master of the parrody and American comedy song-scene, and scream their lungs out as they all sing along on songs like  Eat It ,  Episode&nbsp;I &nbsp;and  Fat .  I personally sat between a mother and her 11-year-old son, and a couple who was in their late 50's.&nbsp; Everyone was singing and having a great time.&nbsp; Al did three encores at the end because he got three standing ovations.   ------------------------------

						   It's strange becoming an uncle... again.  His name is Luke Joseph, and he  was  born yesterday weighing 7lbs. 6 oz. and was 20" long.  We (mom dad and I) watched the kids for the last three days (was it only three?) and they went home tonight with their other grandparents.&nbsp; Their mom and dad and little Luke&nbsp;go home tomorrow.  I hope I can sleep tonight... shouldn't be a problem though!

						   It's been a long weekend, and, so far, an even longer week. There's been a lot on my mind and plate.  For instance, this Sunday I tried a new church which was very friendly, the teaching in the sermon was good, and there is a class for people my age that meets durring the sunday-school hour.&nbsp; They also have a mid-week book discussion for college/career aged people; currently, they are working their way through the  Screwtape Letters  by C. S. Lewis -- reading two chapters then discussing them together.  Sounds great!

						   Today came and went without my hearing from the Administrator of the school. This means one of a number of things. Since he told me on Tuesday that He would call today, here are the most likely cases:   He forgot to call (extremely unlikely as he wanted me to teach at his school, and knew how important this day's message would be to me)  There was a family emergency.  The board decided not to hire me at all, and he tried all day to come up with a nice way of letting me down easily, but failed, and felt so guilty he didn't call.  He was abducted by aliens.   Out of these four options, the second and third are the most likely.  As for myself, I have decided that it was the third option -- they decided not to hire me at all -- because I am tired of getting my hopes up for something only to have that joy ripped from me, and ending up more depressed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "I have never eaten a purple oyster, because, frankly, I was under the impression that they were rotten." -- Elwood    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

						   They say that "tomorrow is another day," as if that should be a comfort.    It isn't.    With the way life has been going for me, it is a threat.  --------------------------------------------------------------  "Of all the people I've met, you are the must human I have encountered in the last 24 hours" -- Elwood  --------------------------------------------------------------  Do you ever have those days when nothing seems to be going for you?  That seems to be me.  I mean, what does a guy have to do to get a good day out of life?  Expect nothing?  I wanted to have a good day -- just one -- the beginning of this week.  I said what a good day would look like; listed four things -- four -- which, if they happened, would be a very good day.  I even went so far as to eliminate some to allow for a very good day: two things.  Nothing.  Sigh...  "Tomorrow is another day."

						   Okay, those of you who don't know, I was slated to be a teacher full-time this fall at Providence Christian School.  However, I just got off the phone with the administrator, and there are only 5 students signed up for fall.  That means that there are not enough students to pay enough full-time teachers.  Therefore, I will probably not be hired as a full-time teacher... ergo, not enough money to make ends meet.  Since I do believe in God, I trust that everything will work out for the best, because He has promissed that those who follow Him, He will do what is best for them.  That being said, I also feel betrayed by Him... again.  You see, I am one of those who put all of my eggs in one basket as He leads me to do, and, since He has lead me this far, I have been trusting that this was what He wanted for me.  The same thing happened with my girlfriend.  I felt she was the one, and, when she dumped me, I felt betrayed, not by her, but by God.  The reason: He had brought us together, and we had followed His leading in every step of our relationship (even on timing of things like holding hands, and saying "I love you").  Therefore, when He told her to break it off, I felt betrayed by God.  Now it has happened again.  I know, deep down, that God does not betray His children, and that He is not vindictive or cruel; when He does something like this, He has something else in mind that, in the long run, will be much better for me.  In the meanwhile, I am fine: "freaked out, insecure, neurotic, and emotional." (The Italian Job)  Just had to tell somebody... even if nobody is reading.

						   Tonight I can't sleep, and, rather than laying there, unincumbered by sleep's blissful pleasures, I decided to create my own on-line journal.  Yippie?  It would seem to me that none would be interested in my rantings, but, even being that the case, I decided to try my hand at chronicling myself.  But the question comes, "what do I put in here?"  Seeing as there are none who know I own a blog, I can certainly put anything I want to say, regardless if I use their names or circumstances in this journal; however, becuase this is an on-line journal, it has the possibility of being found by those friends of mine whom I would not wish to hurt for the world, and so will need limit myself in content.  --------------------------------------------------------------  "It seems to me there are far too few people in this world who appreciate the niceties of bovines." -- Elwood  --------------------------------------------------------------  What is to be done when you have a recently broken heart, no friends in the immediate vicinity, and are in need of companionship?  A phone-call to friends does not even come close to being physically with that person(s) to whom you belong.  Should I try and push myself beyond my boarders to make friends for the sake of making friends?  If so, with whom?  There are really only three options I can see to make friends in my current situation:     1) go to bars,     2) find them at a church     3) wander around hoping you run into someone who looks like        they might be nice and have things in common with you.  Personally, I don't drink, so the first option is eliminated.    At the church I am currently attending, there is only one other person my age, and she brings her fiancee with her.  True, I could look for a new church, but when you find one with people who actually care about you, you tend to neglect the fact that these people are almost all older than dirt, and go for the teaching instead.  So that option has been nearly eliminated.  The third option is ludacrist, which does not altogether eliminate it as an option, but relegates it to the section of "hey, it could happen..."  Another remedy to this problem is to find another girlfriend, but this doesn't seem like all that good of an option (1) because there are no girls in my area I know (see aforementioned problem with meeting new people) and (2) I don't want to be one of those people who go from relationship to relationship, because I am in it for the long-haul...  I mean, I'm 26 and still single.  --------------------------------------------------------------  "Beware the harbingers of doom: speciffically flaming gerbils and guys named Bernice." -- Elwood --------------------------------------------------------------  There has only been one woman I have dated, ever, and she just dumped me at the end of June.  I thought she was the one, and she decided she didn't want to be married... ever... owch. I know she didn't mean it to sound like that, but it came across as a pretty bad rejection.  It's hard for me to think of her.  So, jumping into another relationship doesn't sound all that appealing to me at this point.  But what do I do when I am lonely amd meed physical touch of someone who cares?  It's an hour-and-a-half drive to see any of my friends, and they all have lives.  Me?  I'm currently between jobs... which means I don't have one.  That means no income.  That means no appartment.  That means...  Tada!  I live with my parents!  Ergo: I am a loser.  --------------------------------------------------------------  "How many lawn gnomes do you think I can fit in my trunk?" -- Elwood --------------------------------------------------------------  I feel a lot like Edmond Dantes in "The Count of Monte Cristo" (the book, not the movie).  I'm only to chapter 28, so far, but in that time, Dantes has had everything he had ever loved and known stripped from him, and has to start all over again...  His problem is that he doesn't.  He starts up where he left off 16 years ago, only now trying to change the past.  I can't allow myself to do that, but must keep stryving forward in order to attain the goal of NOT being a loser all my life, but getting a job (which is almost secured, but for the paperwork), getting a place of my own (oh, I would love that!) and starting a life of my own with a wife (which doesn't look like it will ever happen).  Dantes had it easy: he got out of prison with an education unequalled at most universities, and got to start his "new life" with millions upon millions of dollars (comparitively).  The fact that he didn't start his new life, but tried to regain the old one was his main downfall (as Faria warned him).  --------------------------------------------------------------  "Look not to the ground, but to the sky, you who are weary, for from thence proceeds the red-cross packages airlifted to you from those who care most whilst you are interned in the camps against your will." -- Elwood  --------------------------------------------------------------  Well, my eyes are getting heavier now, so this ends chapter 1: My life as a loser with only questions.

      ... at least, what I read of it.  You see, I can usually tell, within a paragraph if a book is worth reading or not (I say usually, because I am not an expert, and often miss books that are supposedly great because of it), and in the case of  Atlas Shrugged , this is my finding. You see, when similies and metaphors are used as symbols, they should not blatantly hit you over the head, and yell "hey, do you see me?" But instead, should lead the reader on throughout -- subtly. In Atlas Shrugged, I felt like I was being flogged with the meaning of obvious symbols -- just in the first three pages. There was the symbol of the tree, and the bum, and the 'calendar in the sky' and the sky-scrapers covered in ivy and rotting, just to name a few.Then we come to the moralistic phrasology of the young Mr. Willers.   When asked what he would want to do, he answered at once, "Whatever is right," and added, "You ought to do something great... I mean, the two of us together." "What?" she asked. He said, "I don't know. That's what we ought to find out. Not just what you said. Not just business and earning a living. Things like winning battles, or saving people out of fires, or climbing mountains." "What for?" she asked. He said, "The minister said last Sunday that we must always reach for the best within us. What do you suppose is the best within us?" "I don't know." "We'll have to find out." She did not answer; she was looking away, up the railroad track. (Rand, 13&14)   Immediately there is a suspension of belief in my mind because children don't talk that way.  There is also the problem of introducing a character without introducing them, then places them both (young Willers and the unknown female) on a railroad track... another obvious symbol for the journey of life.  It was after that paragraph I stopped reading -- the begining of the fourth page -- because I could see where this was leading: moralistic expiation of philosophy.  I have read it in other stories/poems as well -- the ones I had to read for class.  In each case, you can tell the author is trying to make a point, and you know what the point is, but they continue to lead up to the conclusion anyhow... just in case you are a dullard and can't see past the end of your nose.  Herman Melville was an exception to this case.  While his works were filled with blatant symbolism, he treated his works as stories, first and foremost.  When you read Melville's  Benito Cerino , for instance, you can take it as a story, or as an allegory, but the choice is left up to the reader as to how far they delve into the issue.  The same with Poe.  Both of these were masters of the sub-text, and also masters of the story as well.  Nathaniel Hawthorn was a bit more concerned that his message come across, and so wove into the story the point he was trying to make, but you were still able to see the story if that was all you looked for.  Rand, on the other hand, shoves the sub-text through the story in such a way that the reality of the story is skewed and the philosophy shows through.  This may be what Rand had in mind with her book, but, in my opinion, this is not good novel-writing or story-telling.  The fact that her book has reached millions of people with her ideas of utopian society says something for her books: it says there are many people looking for the answers to life's questions, and will turn to anyone who is convincing of their convictions.  It does not, however, say that  Atlas Shrugged , is a good book.  You see, in a good novel, you must (so say many authors) grab the attention of your readers in such a way that they desire to continue reading your story.  The opening is what has your readers continue reading, or put the book back on the shelf.  It is the opening paragraph which determines if people will read on, and, in many cases, the opening sentence determines whether the book is sold.  I don't say the book is no good, I only say that it is not, in my opinion, a good novel.   Rand, Ayn.  Atlas Shrugged.  Yew York:Signet.  1957.

       I'm reading Dostyevsky's  The Brothers Karamazov  in which they have a discussion about this faith, and have quantified it -- a size issue.     Size isn't everything.     We know it has nothing to do with size because a mustard seed has the same faith as an coconut as a walnut as grass seed: there is no difference in faith depending on size... or would you say that midgits don't have as much faith as the rest of the world?  Or that basketball players have a greater faith?    Mustard Seed Faith

        "Doug's Tavern"   As a boy I never missed an opportunity to sneak into the bar with my father. He would be there behind the counter serving up hard liquor to the customers and I loved to watch him slide a beer to within an inch of his mark. There was nobody smoother than my pop. He’d let me in if he saw me standing at the door, and sometimes he’d let me come back and fill taps for some of the customers; if there was a light crowd, he would even let me try my hand at sliding -- I only broke two glasses, and those were the first two. After that, when I was about eleven, I began to go in to help, off and on in the afternoons -- always sneaking up to the door and stepping in just far enough for him to see me and nod before heading behind the bar with him. I got good at passing beer. I could slide a full glass all the way across the counter to stop within two inches of falling onto the floor or someone’s lap.  “Let’s put ‘im to the test!” One man shouted, and the bets were laid down on how close I could get a full tap to the end without falling off or spilling a drop, and another bet on my father beating me at it. Money flew. There wasn’t a man in the place who wouldn’t lay down on a sure thing -- my dad would win: everyone knew it, and everyone bet against me -- except one man. He had been sitting at the back playing a hand of five card stud and raking in enough to keep his boots shined until the end of next century.  “I’ll lay down fifty on the boy,” he said, and set down a large wad of money, “my money says he can get it to tip on the edge without falling.”  Laughter went up around the bar, but the stranger stood his ground. He was a betting man, sure enough. His silver studded buttons spoke not of opulence as much as good luck. He wasn’t from our town, but had shown up two weeks earlier and plunked himself down in my pop’s bar where he would spend his days in cards and money. We all knew him as the stranger, simply because we never asked his name -- didn’t have to; he always paid in cash. He stayed in the “Rusty Moses” across the street and was rarely seen anywhere except in the bar or in the hotel, but once he was seen in church, and once walking into the Sheriff’s office.  “I’ll see that bet,” my father said, “Fifty against.” “You can’t bet against your son Doug,” a voice cried from the group. “Well, you don’t have to drink my beer either, do you William?” “Fine, keep the bet.” “I will,” my father said and laid down two fives on the table. He leaned down and whispered in my ear, “aim low,” he said, “I’m fillin ‘em with whiskey.”  My father’s hands carefully poured the expensive whiskey to the brim of a large mug, then set it down in front of me on the counter. Someone in the back of the crowd put out the lamps everywhere but at the counter, and they all gathered closer.  “They each get three tries,” the stranger said, “the best one counts.” “They only each get two,” another voice shouted, “three’s too many!” “One,” I said. The truth was that I knew I would lose, and so as not to let the torture of my young mind last any longer than it had to, I’d rather lose on the first turn than have to fail at two. “One’s all we really need anyway, right?”  My father winked at me and the final bets were laid. “Who goes first?” “The kid.” “Naw, let Doug go first.” “At the same time.” “Flip for it!” My dad took a coin off the counter and held it up for inspection; “Roy,” he said, “this your coin?” It was made of gold and shined like the noonday sun in the lamp above us.  “Sure is,” Roy said spitting tobacco juice into the can with a satisfying ring. “Take this back. You can’t afford it.” Dad tossed the coin back to its owner who frowned a bit, but knew that my dad spoke the truth.  “I’ll flip then.” Roy said, and tossed the coin in the air.  “Heads.” I called as it tumbled for what seemed an eternity before landing squarely in the old man’s hands.  “Tell you what,” the stranger said clasping his own hand over the coin so there was no way of seeing what side landed up, “let the man go first -- just to make it interesting.”  “Fine.” Dad said, and took up his normal stance behind the counter. He turned the mug in his hands, rolling it like the Indians do to a stick to light their fires -- slowly and steadily. Then, when he felt the time was right, he took the handle in his right hand, hauled back a bit, then launched. The glass slid for the length of the counter until it rested with one quarter inch hanging over the edge.  “Not a drop spilled!” Someone called, and the cheers arose. “Now its the boy’s turn,” my dad called, taking the same mug back and placing it firmly in my hands, “just remember son,” he said, leaning over my shoulders and placing his two large hands over mine, “whatever you spill you have to clean up.”  Laughter came from all sides of the room as my dad let go and stood back to watch. He chuckled as well.  “I’ll show them all,” I muttered under my breath, “I can do it -- pop knows I can do it even though he bet against me! Now what did he tell me? ‘Aim low,’ right? Okay, here goes.”    I dispensed with the rolling of the cup and instead, kissed the handle which sent up another round of snickers from the audience. I hauled back, then noticed the slight condensation trail left by the mug on its last path. “Aim low.” I would. I hauled back again, then let it fly down the same path my father had made, aiming just below where I thought it should stop. The mug slid -- this time with a slight hissing noise as it retraced its trail. It came to the edge and peered over...   Reprint of a Creative Writing Assignment from July 2003
