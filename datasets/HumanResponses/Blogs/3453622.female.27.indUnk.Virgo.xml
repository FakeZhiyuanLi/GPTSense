                                  Tonight Amanda got a time-out during dinner because she was up dancing ballet rather than eating her dinner.&nbsp; She is having a popsicle now though, because she actually took her medicine without a fight.&nbsp; Hallelujah!           &nbsp;

      My orignial post was titled 'Wednesday' but somehow it got erased.    We had a busy day today.. Lunch with friends Open Gym at the YMCA Gymnastics Ballet/Tap class Doctors Appt.  Amanda has a sinus infection, just like Ethan..so now she has to take antibiotics as well.  As if it isnt bad enough fighting Ethan two times a day to take his medicine, we now have to fight Amanda to take medicine two times a day for however long it takes for her to be better for 7 days.  Fortuantely I think this is the first day Ethan has been symptom free.    Ethan has also become an avid climberand climbs on the couches and coffee table and giraffe chairs...it is quickly becoming one of his favorite things to do.  He enjoys turning off the answering machine and pouring cans of pop out on himself when mommy has her back turned for a split second.  He also enjoys tearing Amanda's princess castle to pieces while he stands on the table holding on to it.    I think I forgot to shower today..I'll have to take that onto my long list of things to do today...  Blah.

                                  Tonight we had the usual nightly dinner struggle.&nbsp; Amanda wouldn&#8217;t eat any of her 2 hot dogs because she wanted 3!&nbsp; Because she is 3!           And she &#8220;besided&#8221; we were going to have popsicles for dessert..but when I told her she couldn&#8217;t &#8220;beside&#8221; what was for dessert if she didn&#8217;t eat her hotdogs she screamed&#8230;.           &nbsp;         The nightly battle always goes a little like this.&nbsp; Stay tuned for more.           &nbsp;          &nbsp;

      Amanda put a carrot in her armpit.  When I asked her why she had a carrot in her armpit, she said it was because it looked silly.   Go figure.

                                  Amanda said tonight that her new ballerina doll was skinny.&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah, a little orangey&#8221;&#8230;I got the connection, her skin made her skinny.&nbsp; &#8220;But Belle isn&#8217;t skinny.&#8221;          What is she, we asked?&nbsp; &#8220;A doll.&#8221;&nbsp; Is Daddy skinny?&nbsp; &#8220;No he has hair on his arms.&#8221;&nbsp; Is mommy skinny?&nbsp; &#8220;No.&#8221;&nbsp; But what am I if I&#8217;m not skinny?&nbsp; &#8220;You&#8217;re skinny now, I&#8217;m telling ya, you&#8217;re skinny.&#8221;&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; At least in my almost 4 year olds eyes I am skinny&#8230;even if it&#8217;s only for tonight.&nbsp;     J               &nbsp;          &nbsp;

      So, tomorrow we will be having a birthday party for Amanda.  She will be 4 on June 30th. She is having a princess party again this year, and it is costing us an arm and a leg.  Ethan is also having his 1st birthday in a couple of weeks...July 16th.  Since it's his 1st, I thought he should have his own party.  Now I am thinking we will get a cake and go to Disneyland instead of givng him a party.  Next year they will share a party. More birthday news and pictures to come.

                       st1\:*{behavior:url(#default#ieooui) }                        So, Wednesday is the day that Amanda has her gymnastics class, her ballet/tap class used to be after the gymnastics class, but got cancelled.           &nbsp;         Today in gymnastics, Coach Klaus put the 4 girls in Amanda&#8217;s class to work.&nbsp; They had to move a mat so that it was under the ladder, and when they were finished they moved it back.&nbsp; It was such an adorable thing to see.&nbsp; I was very proud of Amanda, and wished so badly that the battery in my camera wasn&#8217;t dead.&nbsp; She was also very nice and tried to get Cami to join the class when she was having a tantrum and didn&#8217;t want to go.&nbsp; It&#8217;s tough being this age.&nbsp; Amanda has also made another new friend in her class named Lilly that Amanda has been talking a lot about recently.           &nbsp;         Even though the ballet/tap class was cancelled, Amanda is still practicing her ballet regularly, she loves to do and say &#8220;Tendu&#8221; and &#8220;Passe&#8221; &nbsp;and &#8220;Arabesque&#8221;,&nbsp; which took me a lot of research to learn what she was even saying.&nbsp;     J               &nbsp;         Ethan is still climbing like a little monkey onto the couch so he can bang the blinds against the window and try to eat them, he is also still enjoying turning off the answering machine on a regular basis.&nbsp; He still doesn&#8217;t say mama, but tries very very hard.&nbsp; He says &#8220;d.d.d.d..Da!&#8221;           &nbsp;         He still only has 2 teeth, but is really enjoying eating dinner with the family, and I have to say, it was quite a shock when I realized I now had to make 4 dinners.     J    &nbsp; He eats better than Amanda sometimes, I think.&nbsp; He is devouring what he can of his dinner, usually what&#8217;s left after he picks the plate up and puts it up to his face to suck the food off of it.&nbsp;     J               &nbsp;         And the biggest news of the day is that the kids now have a new cousin! Hooray!          But Amanda doesn&#8217;t want to go to   England   she said&#8230;and I assured her we wouldn&#8217;t be able to go back for a good few years.&nbsp; Unfortunately.           &nbsp;         Why can&#8217;t money grow on trees?           &nbsp;          &nbsp;          &nbsp;

                                  Amanda said she is as hungry as a pumpkin.&nbsp; (Which I&#8217;m thinking may be similar to being as tired as a carrot&#8230;see below)          I tried to clarify what I had heard her say and she then asked me if pumpkins eat food.&nbsp; I said I didn&#8217;t think so.&nbsp; So she said he was as hungry as a children instead, not as hungry as a pumpkin, because pumpkins don&#8217;t eat food.           &nbsp;          &nbsp;          &nbsp;

                                  Ethan has now mastered climbing the stairs with something in his hand.&nbsp; The first time it was a little red ball.&nbsp; The second time it was the phone.&nbsp; I&#8217;m convinced one of these days he is going to either call 911 or a foreign country.&nbsp; And you wouldn&#8217;t believe what a thrill it is to push the buttons on the answering machine and hear, Answer On, Answer Off.&nbsp; Amanda also enjoys playing with the phone and recording answering machine messages.&nbsp;            &nbsp;         Amanda wants to solve the mystery of how a shirt got into her top drawer.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t put it there, neither did daddy.&nbsp; She asked if I put it there.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t.          So now it is a mystery.&nbsp; &nbsp;She is convinced it was me because I did the laundry.           &nbsp;         Oh well.           &nbsp;         Amanda has gotten herself ready to go to the pool.&nbsp; She even packed a bag for Ethan with a towel and his &#8220;boy suit&#8221; in an M&amp;M bag of course.&nbsp; She has her own bag packed&#8230;but forgot to put something over her bathing suit&#8230;so she ran back up stairs.            &nbsp;         My very big boy is sitting on the rocking chair with his birthday balloon..Rocking back and forth, pushing buttons, and enthralled with his big sister in her pool coverup.            &nbsp;         More to come&#8230;
