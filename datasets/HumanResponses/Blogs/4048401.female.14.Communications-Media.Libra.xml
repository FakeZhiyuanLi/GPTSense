      How sad, the Western show that Spirit went to last year is on again but I know I cannot go.&nbsp; Dougie is too old and I won't have my new horse by then, what a bummer!&nbsp; I REALLY wanted to go, I might try and get Dougie working, try and con grandma into letting me use Zara or bum a horse of a friend, highly unlikely for any of them to happen though. This is a pic of Dougie (the bay horse) I was just about to dismount so that explains why my hand is in the air and my foot is out the stirrup, lol.   Dougie is&nbsp;taller&nbsp;than the other horse,&nbsp;he is 14.2 the black horse is 14.1 (Doug is just standing&nbsp;further back giving the illusion he is smaller).&nbsp; Doug is a pure standardbred, the other horse is&nbsp;just a mix breed, its claimed to be 'trained as a quarter horse' yeah mate,&nbsp;my&nbsp;miniature is trained as Hanoverian *rolls eyes* I think she means trained as a stock horse....  &nbsp;

      Just a little tester, last night I created a fake hotmail account, different age, gender, location etc.. I tried it on a few friends and all of them beleived I was actually Brad Jones lol.&nbsp; I guess it proves that we have no idea who we really are talking to on the net, all the people were told in the end that I was actually Trish, but not before I got a fair amount of gossip hehehehe.....

      I dont love my mum or dad, I dont miss them and they dont love or miss me either.&nbsp; Both of them have the ability to see me or call me if they desire, which they dont.&nbsp; I live with my grandma, my mum lives 10 minutes away from me and my dad lives half an hour away, not far enough.....

      Something has to be wrong with Sam, he is too perfect.&nbsp; They way he talks, they way he acts, the amount of respect he has for everyone and not to mention his amazing looks!&nbsp; I mean, I REALLY am not something special, I'm like as high in the ranks of the Fugly Club as it goes, I am not the nicest person to be with either.&nbsp; It must be some big joke, I bet he is leading me on or something, nobody as amazing as him would ever like someone like me.&nbsp;   But I can't do anything other than love him, I am addicted to him.&nbsp; Whenever I think about him I feel myself going dizzy and every single second of my life seems to be spent thinking of him, I really love him, I doubt he even knows how much.....

      Could today be any worse? I have ended holidays to go to hell five days a week, I would much rather be out riding Dougie but no, I have to go to school.&nbsp; Yet another day has gone past where I dont stop thinking of Sam, I love him so much! Not like me at all to associate with members of the opposite sex, lol.&nbsp; I just can't help myself, I am crazy about him.

      As some of you may know, Dougie is now really frightened of sudden movements after the attack.  He wouldnt come up to me and ran away whenever I came near.  Its been three days and he showed me his usual self, I am sure he will be fine!  I sat on the gate and watched him eating further away in the paddock, he eyed me and then turned around and started heading towards me.  As he hadnt came near me, I started to cry coz I was so damn happy.  He came up to my and softly put his nose in my lap, then showed me his amazing Dougie cheekiness and pushed really hard, throwing me backwards off the gate.  Lol, he is so cute!

       We stare into the darkness We know our time has come My lord is waiting for me My transgressions soon undone  Raven stands up slowly She knows just to do She takes a hold of our portal And calmly cuts right through  One by one we leave We prove ourselves to him We show to him our strong faith We rid ourselves of sin  I walked along the street I know that this is right My lord forever grateful For the sacrifice tonight      Bt someone I know

      Time goes on  They say that time heals the broken hearted,That with time all is well,But how can they heal something that’s been destroyed,Used to mop up the floor,Stood on and crushed. Baby please don’t mess,With my broken heart,I don’t think,It can take much more. This my greatest flaw,Thinking I knew the draw,Now I’m laying hear on the floor,Blood seeping from my wrists,Wishing it to be over,Now covered in clover!  By Paul Whatever ur last name is      I never meant to hurt you I love you more than u could dream I lay here in my empty shell Listening to silent screams  They say that time will fix it They say I will pull through But how the hell can I forget about it When all I think of, is you  I take a while to trust you Then finally, I confide I tell you all my secrets And then you say I lied   I know I am not worthy I know things wont be the same I know that I'll always love you But I'm sick of this fucked up game   by someone I know

         I went out to see Dougie tonight, still upset about what steve said. I burried a kiss into his furry neck and just dropped to my knees and cried. How could I have let this happen to Dougie? If only I had just turned him around, or left that minute earlier he would be fine, he wouldnt be in pain. If I had chose to just stay at the paddock or gone straight home instead of taking the long route   for a canter my baby boy would not be ripped apart, emotionally and physically.

       Got this email off steve today..  F*** u to ai u can go die u are the stupid one havn a bf in f****** america or wotever i hope u f****** die u and ure stupid horse  I left out the rest as it is irrelevant to the situation. All this because I told him he is a player (I am sorry if 'loving' seven people in a month makes you a player) He can hurt me as much as he wants, but to mention anything about my horse is just sick. Maybe I do deserve to die for many things I have done, but to wish death upon an innocent animal who is in so much god damn pain at the moment is just cruel.

      Just so I dont have to keep telling everyone over and over again, yes Dougie was attacked by a dog today. I was cantering along the school oval and a group of girls I knew called me over. They had their dog (some sort of American Pit bull) with them, muzzled and in a harness, they asked for a ride so they tied the dog up to a tree and got on doug. She got half way across the oval and the dog somehow got out of his harness and starting running at Dougie. We were screaming at her to jump off and as I ran towards dougie I could see the dog trying to attack him, but it had its muzzle on so he just managed to scare Doug a bit.  Someone grabbed the dog and started walking it home, I got on Dougie and walked him around a bit to stop him shaking and snorting. I heard someone screaming at me so I turned around and someone had took the stupid dogs muzzle off and it was running towards us again.  I jumped off, not having enough time to fling dougies reins over his neck I had to hold onto the short of one side. The dog starting ripping at his legs and it kept jumping up and grabbing a hold of Dougies neck and just hanging there while Dougie spun around in circles (me still holding him in case he ran off and the dog went after him). I remember kicking it and screaming for someone to grab the dog but no one would go near it, about ten people were there, just standing watching. In the end I managed to kick the dog really hard and grab a hold of its collar, someone took it off me and I grabbed a hold of Dougie and just started walking home.  I went into shock and didn't look to see if he was hurt, I knew there was blood on him and the dog but I just kept walking. Eventually someone jumped out of a car and started taking over, checking to see where he was bleeding. Some idiot rang 000, getting a ranger, the police and a vet on the scene but I sent a kid to my place to get the float over to get dougie to a vet quicker. I managed to regain my senses and took my shirt off to apply pressure on his wounds (sorry to those who saw it) 11 major lacerations all up. The vet was called and gave him a tetnus jab and several antibiotics, the owner of the dog agreed to pay the bill. He should be ok health wise, but he is now very nervouse and hates sudden movements.  (note: The dog is now dead HAHAHAHAHA)
