						     how can I love this deeply? How can I need so much. These feelings I have, I've never felt before. To need to be with someone more with every breath. To feel so open, so vulnerable, and yet, so protected. Does he know what he does to me? This man I hold so dear. Does he know how I need him?   &nbsp;  I go to bed and lie next to a man I have now realized I never really loved. Not like this.   &nbsp;I lie there, and wonder what made me make the choice to be here. But the lessons I've learned I couldn't do without.  &nbsp;  I think all this, while laying in bed, not even trying to sleep. My mind a rage of past dreams and past lessons. The pain of rejection.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Is my life to be only pain? To have someone watch me from afar, point and laugh?&nbsp; &nbsp;  Or does my love truly wait out there for me, holding the key to my happiness?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Does he return the love that flows forth from my heart?    How can I love him so easily? How can he have touched me so deeply, without even trying?    How can he reach my heart in it's prison of stone, and make me open to him, more open to him than I have been to anyone else, ever?    He truly knows me more than anyone ever has. Stories from my past that cause pain. Somehow, he calms the churning in my soul, healing the weaknesses I've tried so long to avoid.     Yes, he is waiting for me. He holds the key to my happiness. Does he know this? I think he does. I think, in truth, he is just as scared as I, knowing he holds the key. Do I trust him with my key?  &nbsp; smiles &nbsp; Yes.

						   tonight, i sit alone and listen to my husband spend time with his online girlfriend.  alone.  for 5 years i've been alone. wondering when my turn will come, wondering when i'll get the 2 minutes of time to fulfill my needs.  there comes a time, it seems, when one must realize that they didn't get married so they could sleep alone, wondering when they will get some tiny bit of affection. wondering when their needs get met.  after all, don't i give everything i have to him? haven't i been the loyal wife?  but there is someone i hide, deep within my soul, that does fulfill me. someone that has been there for me these 5 years, watching, waiting. being the friend that i wish my husband was. fulfilling the needs that my husband doesn't.  have we slept together? no.  we have the connection i don't have with my husband. the connection i long for. will i make my choice? i already have. and my needs shall soon be fulfilled. i am coming, my love. soon. so very soon.

						   I used to be a night waitress for a Denny's in California. There was this man who would always come in about 4:30 in the morning, and order coffee.  He was an older man, dirty, unshaven but not stinky. Hair was never combed. Clothes always in tatters. He  would always bring in 3 bags, and put then on a chair next to him. You could tell that was all he had in the world. He would always order one cup of coffee, and put his $1.03 on the counter, and into the morning we'd talk.  He would always wait until all the other people had gone, and I had done all my sidework, and as soon as he would open the door, I'd get his coffee, and we'd sit at the bar. Always at the bar.  Now this man, he was not always homeless. He'd had a wife, children, car, and a home. He was a professor, and a teacher at a highschool. Physics was his love. Get him on the subject of physics, and he'd talk for hours.   But on this night, it was different. I'll never forget this night. It was the night he and I truly talked. Not about his past, or mine, or about Physics. This time, we talked about depression, love, loss, and the roads we choose to take as we walk blindly along a path we can't even see. We talked about true age, not just chronological. And this night, I learned something about myself, something I'd always knew was there, but never acknowledged. Will I share with you what was learned? No, because you see, this is not a lesson that was fully learned. It is a lesson I am still learning, one that puts me to the test on a daily basis.   It's a lesson of opening my heart, and letting someone see past my walls. And yes, they can hurt me, shred my heart to pieces. but my heart is not going to die. The love that they tried to kill is not gone, just torn. Wounds heal, over time. We put ourselves out there again, and hope that the person that hurt us will learn from our openness.   Here, for you, is my openness:  There is one person out there, in the world, that owns my heart, more than he will ever know. He has stepped away, closeing himself off. But I still love him. Our future, while right now is undecided, will never tear us apart. He is a 'lifetime'. I can only hope he knows how very much I love him, will always love him. No matter where he is, he is always in my heart.  Is this a good bye? No, we will never say goodbye, because we are one. He does not always feel this, but we are. This is fine. As long as I know, I'll be fine. And someday, when the time is right, we will be together again, when he is ready to be open.

						   We used to talk all the time. Off and on thru the years. He's become my best friend. It's hard not to talk to him. To feel as tho he doesn't want to talk to me. But I will not chase this friendship. I cannot. Even tho it's eating me inside that I can't talk to him. All these things I want to say, all these feelings I have. He doesn't even read my blog any more. sigh. I guess I am truly alone. My plans have changed. I want to transfer out. But to a different place. Live on my own. No one else can touch my heart, it's closed off. It's better this way. This way, no one can hurt me again.  Yes, I am strong. I can make it with a dead heart.   After all, isn't that what everyone wanted from me? To make them feel better, and make me hurt in their place?   They have succeeded. I bow to the masters.   And I walk away with an empty well. Stronger for it, for I no longer have the weakness of feelings. And it's better. The longer I close off my heart, the more it dies, the happier I can pretend to be.  And isn't that what it's all about? pretending to be happy so that others can be truly happy?   Yes, that is how it's always been-there is no hope. Just emptiness.

						   He made love to me last night, my soul mate. Is he aware of this? Who knows. What he is denying while awake, he cannot deny in slumber.  I'm reminded of the song "Dust in the wind". I'd post it, but tears fill my eyes as once again, I am left feeling broken, my other half afraid.

						      Last night, I dreamed of him. I spent the night in his arms, his breath on my cheek. The closeness so comforting, so right. I woke up, and in a haze, knew we'd been together. The connection is still there, no matter how he fights it. I know he was with me last night, holding me. If not in physical reality, then in spirit. My skin still tingles as I remember how I literally felt his presence, his touch, the comfort of his arms around me. sigh. but will he admit it? will he face me? even tho he knows it's right, he's still running. we both know the timing is off, but at least I don't run from what I know is truth. He is my soulmate. The one who completes me. We may not be together right now, but we will be. Does he believe this? No. He is fighting, so hard. But last night confirmed it. The connection is there, whether we like it or not.

						    This song means a lot to me, right now, as I'm sure Robyn knows. This song touches me very deeply. ~sigh~  Artist: 	 Seether Album: 	Disclaimer II Title: 	Broken    I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away You've gone away, you don't feel me, anymore  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away You've gone away You don't feel me here anymore

						        Artist:	Alanis Morissette	    Album:	Alanis Unplugged	    Title:	You Oughta Know	   i want you to know that i'm happy for you I wish nothing but the best for you both An older version of me Is she perverted like me Would she go down on you in a theater Does she speak eloquently And would she have your baby I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother  'cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no And every time you speak her name Does she know how  you told me you'd hold me Until you died, 'til you died But you're still alive   Chorus: And i'm here to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It's not fair to deny me Of the cross i bear that you gave to me You, you, you oughta know  You seem very well, things look peaceful I'm not quite as well, i thought you should know Did you forget about me mr. duplicity I hate to but you in the middle of dinner It was a slap in the face how quickly i was replaced Are you thinking of me when you fuck her  'cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me you'd hold me Until you died, 'til you died But you're sill alive  Repeat chorus  'cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me And i'm not gonna fade As soon as you close your eyes and you know it And every time i scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it...well can you feel it

						      And now, the pain. oh yes. the feeling that i've lost my best friend forever. the knowledge that they are avoiding me like the black plague. And now for a change of subject. This morning i got up early and went out to the spanish trail and sat with my knees to my chest watching the moon. Asking questions i'm not sure i wanted the answers to, searching for answers i didnt' want to find. I want to run from this pain. The memories assault me tonight. The road is still calling me. I could transfer to Ohio. I could transfer to Enid. I could transfer almost anywhere in the united states, or even Canada.  ~sigh~  I have a song for tonight. A song that is really special to me. It reminds me of  3 girls that I had to let go about 9 years ago. Three very special little girls, with many problems, and much love. Tanya, Kristi, Brandy, this song if for you, girls. Know always I remember you and love you. I will always be here.     Unlike many, I do not walk away from those I love.         Artist:      Patty Loveless Album:     Classics Title:     How Can I Help You To Say Goodbye?  (burton banks collins/karen good taylor)  Through the back window of a '59 wagon I watched my best friend jamie slippin' further away I kept on waving 'till i couldn't see her And through my tears, i asked again why we couldn't stay Mama whispered softly, time will ease your pain Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same  And she said, how can i help you to say goodbye? It's ok to hurt, and it's ok to cry Come, let me hold you and i will try How can i help you to say goodbye?  I sat on our bed, he packed his suitcase I held a picture of our wedding day His hands were trembling, we both were crying He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away I called up mama, she said, time will ease your pain  Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same  And she said, how can i help you to say goodbye? It's ok to hurt, and it's ok to cry Come, let me hold you and i will try How can i help you to say goodbye?  Sitting with mama alone in her bedroom She opened her eyes, and then squeezed my hand She said, i have to go now, my time here is over And with her final word, she tried to help me understand Mama whispered softly, time will ease your pain Life's about changing, nothing ever stays the same  And she said, how can i help you to say goodbye? It's ok to hurt, and it's ok to cry Come, let me hold you and i will try How can i help you to say goodbye?  How can i help you to say goodbye?

						      Yes, tonight, this is my song. Tonight, tomorrow. until the pain goes away, and i can see the sun again.  Artist:     Reba Mcentire Album:     What If It's You Title:     Just Looking For Him  (sunny russ)  She can concentrate on workin' Until her work is done She can hold a conversation As well as anyone She'll fool you with sincerity And if you didn't know her well You would never see it You could never tell  Chorus: She's just looking for him She's only rememberin' She might look like she's ready To fall in love again But she's just looking for him  She keeps one eye on the road And one on the other lane Lookin' for his car His memory's re-played She searches other faces Tryin' to find that spark But no one new can reach her Or fill her hollow heart  Repeat chorus  Oh you'd better keep your distance Don't let her reel you in She's not quite herself now How could she be when  Repeat chorus

						   I was thinking today about some things. I was falling hard for someone. Or maybe I had fallen hard already. But after seeing the pain my father caused my mother over another woman, after seeing a 37 year marriage washed down the drain... I am walking away. He will always be a dear friend ... and if ... someday ... then we shall see. We are both with other people though and I can not be the kind of person who condemns someone for my own sins. So I will keep him tucked in my heart, safely away from view til the day comes in this life .. or the next when times are better. When we can be free to do as we wish.

						      Ok, I think I've decided this is to be an online journal, one that one person knows about. but i'm not too worried, this one person doesn't care to read it anyway. so no problems. i'm back in Q.A. today, which is nice. just for the week tho, because one of the girls is on fto. but hey, that's ok. i can just work here for a week. who knows, i might just make quality supervisor. that would be awesome. my plans for the future haven't changed any. i'm still wanting to do what i told my ( i think they are anyway) bestest friend i wanted to do. maybe not the same place, or the same situation, but i still want to do it. i know only i understand what i'm talking about, but that's ok. i'm the only one this matters to anyway. i feel old today. angry. bitter. humiliated. almost scorned, even. and hurt. you know, it's amazing how i hurt. what's even more amazing is how the source of my hurt probably doesn't give a crap that she/he/it is hurting me. which does nothing more than make me hurt worse. lol. god, i'm pathetic. and as i realise this, i feel humiliated even more. sigh. i don't know. i just don't know. i don't know how the source of this hurt got thru my protective walls, but now i wish it hadn't've. all it means is more hurt for me to have to deal with in my life. it seems i'm always the comforter, the healer, but never healed, or comforted. there's just something wrong with that. what did i do in a previous life that has caused me to have to deal with so much pain? i guess i'll never understand. oh yeah, i'm taking comments off my posts in here from now on. i don't want to see what anyone has to say, and i don't care who reads this. it's enough that it's here, because it's here for me, and me alone. finally, i'm selfish.

						   Tonight, bound and broken, i crawl into bed. I lay beside no one. Emptiness fills me as i look at my tank of fish. Pretty fish, given to me as a gift. I wonder, a gift of love? or a gift of gratitude for works done. i reach into my tank, and touch a fish. so easily he slips thru my fingers, just as the one i love has. and as my fingers in the water, i sit alone, everything around me fearing me. why am i to fear? all i want is to love freely, without the fear of being hurt. all i ask is love in return. yet here i am, bound and broken, the one i love gone in fear of me because of a vision he had. a vision he will not tell me. a vision of a lie i'm supposedly to have told him. yet he will not tell me the vision, nor the lie. yet i am to accept this vision, and the lie, and make them my own, because, of course; he saw it- therefor it is. just as my mother saw me as an ugly and vile creature, to be left for dead. just as my step father saw me as nothing but an object made for his satisfaction. so, too, my love saw a vision, and once again i am left hurting and alone, longing for peace. am i what they say i am? am i something to fear, a thing that only causes pain and destruction wherever i go? if this is so, what is my purpose for living? i do not want to cause pain i do not want to hurt. i do not want to be alone any more. i'm so tired. so very tired.

      There are times when I wonder if anyone actually ever posts something short and direct to answer a question that has been put to them.  I am a member of several groups on one of the fun little places on the net where folks choose to gather. . Someone asked what i thought was the simplest of questions, and there were so many long drawn out posts to answer what was such a simple question  Can one use magick without believing in a higher power. The answer is simply yes it is just a basic form of energy manipulation. Why this takes 6 paragraphs to answer is totally beyond me. Truely wise folks should be able to say what they mean directly and with few words in my humle oppinion.  that being said here is one of my favorite proverbs from Persia.  he who knows not, and knows not that he knows not, is a fool, shun him. he who knows not and know that he knows not, is a child, teach him.  he who knows and knows not that he knows, is asleep, wake him. he who knows and knows that he knows, is wise, follow him.

      The Dagda he has other names as well. Eochaidh Oiiathair (father of many), Ruadh Ro-Fheasa (the All Knowing Noble or Lord of Great Knowledge *depending on the translation*), and Aed (Fire).  He is associated with the following magickal intentions: Animals, Children, Clear Thinking and Wisdom, Elemental Magick, Faery Contact, Father Gods, Overcoming Fear, Fertility, General Magickal Aid, Masculine Concerns, Mental Prowess and Intellect, Music, Death and the Underworld, Prosperity, Abundance, Protection, Self-esteem, and Warriors (male and female).  He is thought to be Tuatha De Danann, but is older than even their myths. He is a warrior god and a trickster. like the Morrigan, he is a death and rebirth god. He carries a club. One end is rough and takes life the other is smooth and returns life. It is said that when his oldest son was killed, he carried the body on is back and travelled to the far east. On the road he met three wise men. They were carrying many wonderous things. Amoung their possesions was the club. He talked them into letting him hold it. He was a warrior after all and it seemed like an amazing weapon. He touched the three wise men with the rough end and they fell deads. He then used the smooth end to resurrect his fallen son and then the wise men as well. For his good intentions the wise men gave him the club on permanent loan. It is said this is also when he recieved his cauldron of abundance ( from which no one would leave unsatisfied) and his harp ( with which he could play enchanted music).  He is the Consort, and some say flat out husband of the Morrigan. He lays in the river while she strattles the banks in order to "know" her. He did this most notably before the great battle of Mil in order to gain magickal aid from her for the Tuatha De troops. He has tricked the Formorians out of their Cattle and a King out of his castle on behave of those who would ask him for his wisdom.

      This is where I will shove my odd little thoughts.  What do I think about?  Quite simply ...everything LOL.  Mostly I concern myself with seeking spiritual truth and spending time with those I love. The same thing really when you think about it.   Well this is my first little blurb.  It is late and I am happy.  I have had a fairly good day.  I joined a couple of yahoo groups and that should be cool.  I had a lovely evening with my mate.    So with that, I am going to run away for a little while.  I need sleep, perchance to dream. :)

      Have you ever gotten to talking with old friend and it just totally spoiled you mood? That happened to me today. I watched and listened as my mood just slid into a very dark place. They wanted to talk about my dead ex. They wanted to talk about a dead friend and her evil assed husband who has rape fantasies about me. They wanted to talk about things I havent had any interest in for 3 years. What do people have in their heads. I tried to change the subjects but no ... on and on it went until I needed to come here and rant. I just wish folks would stop and think that maybe some of us out here dont need to rehash painful moments in our lives

       Unsettled   for Bret   The desk waits holding his things: a child's bible saving a daisy that his mother placed there from the time he was four and flowers still pretty, not dead things arranged for show; three dice, on his last roll, a five, is this how he finally decided, a roll of the dice; an old tin, in its' small holes lay his forgotten things; pebbles and buttons, bullets and bubblegum, a folded note read, its questions answered. The desk has waited  alone for a year. She came and packed everything else. It does not understand it holds what the mother can not bare, a lottery ticket with seven words written by her son. Words that do not  explain. Alone the desk waits all that is left in the room where dust never settles.  © Robyn Moondancer

       Rabid   for Anna   Few dare to wander deep in the heart of the wood where twilight makes a home. Foul mist rolls through twisted bodies, skeletal trees reaching for the sun in this infernal night, as faint sounds, unholy rhythmic hoof beats of the nightmare toll her passage. She flies, leaving in her wake broken remnants of lost souls who stumble toward her lair, hapless bone trophies caught unaware by the beast. She once was proud and noble crowned with gold, now fever maddened this unicorn.  © Robyn Moondancer

         Aquisition by Inquisition   Priests came in robes of red, washed in the blood of the Lamb. Their path was marked by the dead. They came to judge and damn.  Washed in the blood of the Lamb, Priests burned the infirm and old. They came to judge and damn, to purge by horrors untold.  Priests burned the infirm and old, birthmarks and moles as signs, to purge by horrors untold,  to fulfill material designs.  Birthmarks and mole as signs, witches judged and made to stand, to fulfill material designs, to gain valuable land.  Witches judged and made to stand frightened, naked, alone, to gain valuable land, for The Church to call its' own.  Frightened, naked, alone, they stood in public disgrace. For The Church to call its' own, they were buried, no marker, no trace.  They stood in public disgrace without hope of any salvation. They were buried, no marker, no trace, with the Pope's holy sanction.  Without hope of any salvation, their path was marked by the dead, with the Pope's holy sanction, priests came in robes of red.   © Robyn Moodancer

Maybe it was the gods looking out for me. Maybe it pissed me off lol. Yeah it does tick me off when this happens. It seems to happen all the time these days. My plans just seem to come undone. Oh well it could be worse. I could be on fire lmao.

       OMFG  You ever have one of those days where the world sort of shifts on its axis and you are left with no clue how you got where you are? I had one today. I watched as folks I thought I knew ... folks I cared about tore eachother apart. It was sad. I have seen this happen before but this time it hit me hard. I can not understand how folks who claim to care for eachother can so easily go for the jugular. My there are times when I would love to be anything but human. At least in the animal kingdom you know who the predators are. Not here though not among humans.

      You know what I love? Jealous frelling assholes. You know the ones I mean. The folks who have no lives, no friends, can NOT get laid. I have discovered a bunch of these folks in an online group of mine. Or rather to be more precise, wanting to invade this group. They are wicked little whiners who are so obsessed with wrecking our good time, that they dont have any fun of their own. No I come home from a day of work. A bad day I might add to find out that they have threatened my home based business. I just wish they would grow the hell up and stop causing problems.

      It was a rather good day today. I made a small piece of jewelry and now have to make 4 others just like it for folks who want it. We mailed out a large EBay order. I am looking forward to the camping trip this week. I can not wait to unplug and get out where I can breathe real air. I do believe that being out in the woods with my rocks and my mate will be very good for me. I just cant stand the city right now. With any luck at all I can come back re-energized with a ton of new jewelry and a great attitude.   So until next I write, love and light. And by all means, take a walk in the woods :)

      In the cool clear crisp of midnight at the calling of the moon they come into the circle singing quiet breathy tunes  at the calling of the moon answering her children singing quiet breathy tunes  She looks into Her cauldron  Answering her children as in times of old She looks into Her cauldron in their blessed sacred grove  As in times of old The Mother hears each child in their blessed sacred grove in Her image each one styled  The Mother hears each child as they come into the circle in Her image each one styled in the cool clear crisp of midnight

      Memories haunting her as she grieves thinking of happily shared days playing hide and seek among the leaves  With shutters and sobs her tired heart cleaves and she is taken by a mourner's craze memories haunting her as she grieves  Wiping her tears on Kleenex sleeves she stares at the sun's dying rays playing hide and seek among the leaves  And all the old truths are lies she perceives doubting every song of praise memories haunting her as she grieves  In her fury her soul she deceives from her faithful path she strays playing hide and seek among the leaves  Outraged she questions all she believes her heart flares in angry blaze memories haunting her as she grieves playing hide and seek among the leaves.

      We are exactly islands alone, adrift in thought trapped in walls of perception within our bodies caught  I see the world before me as only I can know I am the sleeping dreamer watching from shadow  Are the colors that you see all the same as mine? we shall never know we are islands for all time.

      Castle walls and the wailing of the innocent dead I remember when we first met. You watched me from a distance Your eyes mere red slits stealing glimpses from the shadows I watched you watching me for days  I remember you finally floating to me  Drifting slowly toward my heart Others watched speaking to me secretly They wondered about you as much as I did I felt chosen that is the only word that fits Out of all those confined in the walls of our own making You came to me  My sweet and gentle beloved Small and haunted as you were  I loved you then and love you still I still feel you watching and wondering I know you don't understand Why I "played" when so many others did not Why I still do I am not a cold and hard mistress of the night In my heart is a softness, a small child plays there She loves ...

      Crows swoop and dive  talking to themselves and to another the little one invisible to all but himself and the one that loves him brother lover destiny child Away you fly always north or west but always away I look for you  searching the heavens  for just one glimpse You come to me from time to time to be fed blood love  from the corpse that calls  your name "Beloved" Small sacrifice for the  company of the light  of one smile, the touch of  one chill breath from your stoney cold lips Then they call  swooping and diving ready for freedom you float away north or west you fly always away

      Ever deeper you draw me in to Your darkness The cool breeze that is you sweeps through My dark dry soul  You come as a mist to me My lifes blood yours as always Wrapped in your sweet incense  Droplets that are you Stream down my neck  I feel the light and chill touch of  Your formless soulself Deeply you drink  from the opening I made for you Sipping from me, from your lady Lost are we you and I  Our madness shared  A burden Shared is yet a burden. I feel you grow thick against me Feel you sink into my lap as you lap what yet flows from my veins. Sweet muzzy lightheaded pleasure We sustain each other you and I I fill you as you empty me  As it must be as it always was As it ever shall be Beloved and Lady Loved

      I wish that no one ever had to feel to feel pain. I don't mean physical pain either. Physical pain serves a real purpose. It lets you know that your body needs to mend. I mean deep emotional pain. It just tears me up knowing how much some of the people I care about are going through right now. It is worse that there is not one damn thing I can do to make it better for them. There's a line from a song that says "I want to lift you up and steal your pain". I wish I could do this for them. If there were way to accomplish this I would do it. I know we all have to go through certain things in this life to learn the lessons we were meant to learn before we leave this place. I just think it would be nice if it didn't hurt quite so much. It breaks my heart to see how deeply pained, broken or defeated some people feel right now. Some of it is only temporary I know. Some of it is going to leave wounds, not scars but open wounds, and I am only so good at first aid when it comes to heartbreak.

      Well it was one of those days when everything from your past catches up with you. I was "sitting" in a chatroom, when this voice came over the speakers and stopped my heart cold. I felt the blood drain out of my face as I sat there and listened. It was a voice that should never have been heard again. A few years ago I was in a very intense relationship with a fellow. It was amazing and dangerous. He made me feel things I never thought I would feel. Then, things turned bad and I called the whole thing off. We had planned to be married. That just could not happen. Soooo a few months later I get emails and phone calls from a very good mutual acquaintance. He told me that my ex was dead. He said he had killed himself in a very unpleasant manner and I was mentioned in the note. He let me know what was said, mostly just that it was my fault. Soooo after years of guilt and grieving, I hear his voice issuing from my speakers. Oh yes this was the dead ex I had listened to his voice for years. We talked for hours on line, on the phone, and in person. It was indeed him. I am not sure how to proceed, if indeed I should do anything at all. I have let go of the guilt I had over his "death". Perhaps as crazy as he obviously is I should let that dog lay.  On a lighter note, I saw one of my oldest friends from my current chat residence yesterday. It was very good to see him. He championed me early on when I took chat too seriously and too personally. He was one of my bright spots in that place when it was still rather dark for me. He took a "short" break ... which stretched into a year. I have missed him. And as for his usual roll in my life he did bring a smile to me even when I was sad about some plans that had fallen through. I love those folks who can disappear from your life for a while, then show back up and you can pick up right where you left off. We did just that, like he had been here all the while. He is one of my timeless friends and shall remain so.

      It just amazes me at how good intentions go unnoticed. Or maybe not unnoticed, but rather uncared about. I gave an acquaintance some very good advice toady. By golly she went and took it. I thought, well thank the Gods someone is finally listening to the witch. Well SHE listened, but somehow all the folks around her missed the point. She ended up being put down and rather nastily talked to for trying to make a wrong right. Mind you, this wasn't just her wrong but another party's as well. I wonder sometimes why folks just can not keep their traps shut until they have looked over everything to do with a subject rather than just jump on the bashing bandwagon. If folks had taken the time to read all the posts in the little group I am part of, they would not have needed to jump this woman. She was indeed trying to fix a problem in a way that I helped her find. I wish that folks would back off sometimes and give things a few moments before they react to consider all the aspects of a thing, a thought, or an action before they would act upon their impulses. But again these are well intentioned words, so likely I would get an ass chewing from some folks if they read this. *chuckles*

      I have made some really great and horrid discoveries lately. I have discovered that I can hate. I didn't really know that. I also discovered that some folks are just given more than their fair share of pain and trial. I have some folks that I feel very close to who have chosen to open to me lately. I am very glad that they did, but some of their tales will haunt me. I can not believe the depth of love some of these folks can feel after some of the things they have lived through and are still living through. They inspire me to many emotions, admiration, deep sadness, wonder and yes hate. It is alright though, to love completely you must have hate I suppose. So I will welcome it and try to make friends with it as best I can so that it does not overwhelm me. Wish me luck on this venture.

      I got a message from a dear friend who sadly thought a post was about him/her. It was not of course. It was about someone else that we both know. Funny how lives wrap around each other in small groups and intertwine. A synchronizing sets up and we all shall the same kinds of energy at the same time. One member finds out that the folks around them know exactly how they feel because everyone else has been there, in the same place in one way or another, at one time or another. I wish I could teach everyone the things I have learned about echoes. Not the echoes of sound, but of thought, word and deed. And lets not forget emotional echoes, they are the loudest and longest of all echoes. Like dropping a pebble into a pond : if the pond is open and smooth, the ripples will play out rather quickly and die quietly. If the pond has many things in it breaking the smooth surface, one ripple turns into two and then three and before you know it there is chaos as all the ripples become intermeshed. The calm surface is shattered. Believe it or not I actually have diagrams of this for an article I plan on publishing someday, unless the article turns into a book. lol . At any rate, C, you know who you are, This nothing I have posted here was about you. I am sorry if it felt that way, but like I said synchronizing is at play. There are others we know who are in really hurtful situations that feel like yours. Talk to me soon and I will explains. C know that you are loved, at least by me : )  We are soul siblings who have lasted through time, nothing will change that.

      I has come to the realization that I really do not like my empathy especially when dealing with other empaths who are in pain. I am still reeling from an empathy overload induced migrain. Not only does my head hurt but my fingers have a mind of their own. My typing sucks and my mood is shot. This is after cleansing and doing some candle work. The shit we do for our friends. lol Funny thing is that most likely in this instance the friend will never know what I am going through. So all in all being an empath is lonely at best and painful at worst.

      Sometimes I cant get over the hurt folks inflict on each other. People who claim to love you, throwing it all away for nothing. I have been through this once or twice. I have an exhusband who cheated on me from before we were married right up until the day we divorced. He has a child with his new wife that was born a full year before I even knew he was having an affair. I also have a dead fiancee who wrote to me saying that I was the reason for his death. "You have bled me dry. I am just finishing the job." I found out from his brother that he slit his own throat. I now have a friend who has been hurt deeply and why? Lies. Who knows why the lies were told. To tell the truth, I don't really care why ... I just hate that his heart knows the kind of ache mine does. Noone should have to go through it. It is not right and it is not fair. When you love someone with your whole heart and they trounce you it hurts more than words can say. Betrayal of trust is worse than being beaten. The physical scars heal but the ones inside ... they never do.   So here you go this list of rules. I swear if you follow these rules you can live happy: 1) Never Lie.... dealing with the truth might hurt but not nearly as badly as trying to regain lost trust, 2) Never Hit... fear will kill love and let me tell you there is nothing worse than a battered mate to deal with I know I have been one and he bares the scars, 3) Never Cheat....like lying this will totally mess with trust and it ends badly. You want to leave then leave, you want to stay then stay. But please folks be honest in your dealings with your mate.

      I had been perfect pure and white totally unblemished  Then he came smearing me with his black ickor  Tearing me away from my friends bending  me to his will  Confining me for days at a time flaunting  me in my fallen  state before his friends for their opinions not of me but of the changes his hand had wrought  Eventually unsatisfied with his craftsmanship he flings me into the trash bin to find a new victim and begin again   Robyn Moondancer ©  2002

      I have been a little down lately for no good reason. I think maybe I am just in a rut. I spend all of my waking either working or on this frelling computer. It is eating up my life again. I think maybe it is time for a little break. Read a book or two. Go see a movie. Go for walk. I have got to get away from this comp. I have discovered that it is harder and harder for me to get along with the folks I know on here. There are really only a handful of people that I really care about. I know this sounds awful but, the rest are just window dressings for me. That's ok though, because I get the feeling more and more that I am just window dressing for them too. So the few I care about can email me and they will. The others wont even notice I am gone.

      There are times in a person's life when everything changes over night. When everything you thought you knew melts away and is replaced by something else. I thought I knew someone. I was lead to believe that I did. Maybe I just allowed myself to believe it. The fact is that I did not. And once again I am left thinking everyone is exactly an island. I am healer by nature and a warrior by trade. I was playing healer so hard for someone I truly cared about that my warrior side was blinded. I came close to losing everything because of this. I see now that the trickster takes many forms. Those forms do include friendship and love. I did not expect the trickster to take this form. Why that is I do not know. I know better than that. Even in the Christian religion they warn of the devil taking the form of all things beautiful. I was hurt and lonely and blind. I was looks outside my life for something to help heal myself. This friend, this man was what I chose for he seemed to need healing too. His way of healing was to try to tear me down sadly. He twisted what were my good intentions for his own amusement. He got between me and my mate. Then he denied his own complicity in the events of late and offered my mate a place to dwell should I choose to end that relationship. This man who did say more than once that he loved me, was grateful to me. He didn't, he wasn't and now I am left wondering about human nature and the need to destroy. I do not know why when we are hurt we choose to destroy the things around us to lift ourselves. We could do so much more good for ourselves and those around us if rather than destroy we would lift up, we would build up. I wish I could better express these thoughts. I can not though. I have been hurt in two ways. I lost one of my best friends, only to discover he was never my friend at all. I got a "two for one" as I like to call. But I refuse to be bitter about this. He served a purpose in my life. He showed me a weakness that I had not looked at in myself. He also showed my mate and I the problems in our own relationship. I think he expected my mate and I to call it quits. We did not. We connected with each other in a new way. I am no longer on a pedestal I am human now with flaws and pain and weakness. We are on even footing he and I. This is a good place, a new beginning. So for all your hurts to me should ever you read this, and you will know who you are, You made me stronger not weaker. You made us tighter and did not separate us. You will be rewarded in the end for your deeds. For your sake, I hope the good of what you have done outweighs the bad. I hope your life is as filled with all the joy you have brought into mine. Take that as you will.   And to my dearest and only friend I love you. Reazy and I both do. You mean the world to us. You helped us in a deep time of trouble and that will not be forgotten. We are starting fresh with open eyes this time. The worship is over, and we can love honestly now. Thank you C. You have no idea how much you are loved.

      I am having one of those deep down lonely days. I can not explain it. For no reason at all, I feel like I have lost my best friend in the world. Where does that come from? There is no reason for it. I had a bad day at work yes. I am alone in the house. But I treasure my alone times. I don't understand this sudden and overwhelming sadness. It is truly like someone close to me just died. I hate it when I feel this way. I am glad that it doesn't come around often.   Maybe pain lets me know I am alive. Or maybe I am not allowed to be happy for more than 5 minutes at a stretch. It never gives me a warning though. It just slams into my chest and all I can do is cry. Maybe I am crazy. Maybe I am .... Who knows what I am? I should just shut up not. All this self-indulgent bs is not my style anyway.

      It isn't hate that holds you Its the fear you let inside The chains you let enfold you Could be easily untied If you open up your heart You would see a change Then all the things that bind you Would simply fade away

      I had a nice evening with Reazy. He was so very sweet. Not that he isn't all the time. I was just more open to it last night than I have been for a while. I think his mood is improving and that helps a lot. It is just so much easier to open to a happy person than to a little ball of sad. LOL I cant wait til he gets his meds and we can get back on track. I am tired of the strain. I want things to be more like yesterday, more like our anniversary. I saw glimpses of the man I fell for last night. I cant lie I slept better for it.

      Today seems more normal than yesterday upon waking. I am indeed all in this world. I have heard from the one who worries me sometimes and now know that he is still breathing. This is a very good thing. I find more and more that I want to chat less and less. I find myself hanging on pager. I have also noticed that in doing so I do not deal with so much drama, but fewer folks speak to me. Maybe it is out of sight out of mind. I am not sure. If I go too long without seeing someone who's mind I enjoy I will pm them ... but I have found that it is very revealing about me and some of the folks in the room where I chat. I am talking with the same folks more and more ... and others, who are so enjoyable in chat less and less. Perhaps it is harder to carry on a one on one conversation. Or maybe, it is just harder to fake true substance. I have said for years I am what I type... that isnt true for everyone though. I wish it were. I wish this medium werent a convenient mask for so many. I have found 5 folks who are who they appear to be.... such a small number for 7 years of chat ... not even one a year. this just floors me. anywho ... enough of this chatter or I will long for that other world... and I can not yet leave this one.

      There are days when I wake and don't feel all here. I have one foot in this world and one ...somewhere else. This is one of those days. I feel like anything could happen...like something is waiting for me somewhere. What and where however, I have no clue. Maybe it is because I haven't talked to one of my best friends in a couple of days. That always messes with me a little. Maybe it is the call of the wild .. I hear that a lot you know. The forests call me ... or the mountains ... or whatever it is that lives there and goes unseen. The spirits know my name and on days like these it seems they are using it... they are calling. Some have said these are my spiritual days ... the days I work my magick or I write poetry ... or cry ...   These are unsettling days for me. These are days when I think about the glimpse I got of another world. One in which I long to walk. One where I might truly be who I am. Here we are wrapped in flesh and rules and lies and death ... I long for that other place on days like these ... I am homesick ... and I don't know where home is ... that is the best way I can describe it.
