There supposed to be gone but I found him at a walmart in indiana on the top shelf pretty sweet and i put a marage(energon) in its place. i plan to go back and get him one of these days or a couple of the little 6.99 ones.anyway as i stepped back to admire my transformer shelf i got a whiff of something ripe  so i looked around  and guess what i found........a big ol shit put there by one of my dogs yeah real funny my dog is a sneaky little shit shes too good to shit outside but im gonna change that because im sick of it.im real tired and need to go to sleep so good night.

      Today the first thing my dog did was run out of the yard which has a locked iron gate and darted out onto a very busy street WONDERFUL! if she got hit by a car id would of been kicking the shit out of her crushed little corps as i scooped her onto a shovel. She's barely hanging on man and then tonight she deciced that she was a little munchie so so snaked on my wife's bra . the straps are nowhere to be found . I dont know what to do with her that little bitch . anyway we barbecued and ate meat good times had a water fight and came inside and sweated it out some more i hate the summer . I've been eating lots of water melon and has just realized that the reason i have to use the bathroom every half hour is the goddamn water melon! Stupid me .im off to use the bathroom.
