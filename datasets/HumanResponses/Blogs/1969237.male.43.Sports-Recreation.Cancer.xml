        I was very upset about something the other day, so I went and bought a slingshot.I have no idea about the slingshot..I can't hit fuck all with it. I can hit whatever I want with a gun though..which makes me immeasurable happy. I so thought I had lost that skill. Honestly, it's about as happy as I am about getting back the ability to play guitar- like I found a peice that has been missing.     Anyway, I got to thinking..it was that damn "Frontier House" program that started me down this road to wanting a house. There is a scene where a guy is building a fence and bitching that he isn't getting enough food- and it turns out he needs to drink more water. Oddly enough, I have had a desire to build a fence or anything ever since that scene. It feels like everything in life that should have hit me at 33 is hitting me now. Damn wreck.    So I am digging into how to build a house, reading books and the internet. I have come to realize that the Jeep can't haul enough of a load to be of use, and that as much as I want some city car..I need another truck. Funny thing, I seem to have a line on a Chevy as of tonight...for about half of what I hope to sell the Jeep for. It's in perfect shape too..a retired air force guy here owns it. Weird stuff. It's like what you need happens if you let it.    Speaking of which, I have been all over the internet lookinbg at alternative buildings..meaning, for the most part, anything that was done for centuries before the lumber barons of the US decided to say it all sucked. I have looked into Solar, Straw Bale, Cob, Adobe, Earth Plaster, Rammed Earth, Log, Slip-form Masonary....pretty much anything that's been done. I am looking for cheap but effiecent with little upkeep.     So Adobe is cool, good for thermal issues, but lots of upkeep. I have stumbled onto Straw Bale construction. It is simply bales of straw, stacked as walls..and then plastered to protect it. You can stucco the outside and make very fluid shapes. Weirdly, a freind mentioned that a friend of his back east built a house this way..and now..it seems like every damn magazine I pick up has straw bale write ups in it!   I mean...mags on living green, mags on home power...its like the world is saying "LOOK HERE DUMBASS!". I have also found colored stuccos that remind me of old Italian villas...so much cooler than normal paint. Anyway....  ...today I was going to drive to Forest Falls..but went past it and made a grand loop all the way through Big Bear. During the drive I was thinking of how much I really don't like the whole "Southwest" type building. It's OK..but not for me. Then it struck me...most of the construction is very much like old Italian villas...! So I began to surmise that for a floorplan and exterior look I could do a straw bale house for many modern reasons, with a villa look to it. Then, I drove past a lot- and had a major deja vu flash from years and years ago..I pictured a villa on this lot near Mentone I think it was- and here I was driving around thinking about how that would fit in to the area well....weirdness. It was like the general area, the lighting, everything, had crawled out of the dream like 15 years ago. The rest of the dream had a wife and a young mistress living under the same roof and about 4 kids. So I doubt it is actually a sign of a true thing that will happen...;<>!    So, as I study, it seems like log construction, while useful in this area, is still more expensive and can't have the overall effect I like best...while straw bale can.I suppose I should work towards a villa...as I could probably build the first section to live in, and then build the other wings later. In the court yard I would simply HAVE to have a mosiac layout of the Italian Raiper circle invented by Thibault.....which, of course, would force me to get off my ass and actually learn the system....     But building something like that HERE? I am not sure. It's where my income is at now. I want a place by the beach in the end. Maybe this is just a step I need to take.     Most of all..it seemed that no matter where I went looking for eco-friendly stuff...sooner or later I got linked back to Findhorn...! How weird. I am much in turmoil tonight.....

      I have lived in apartments for far too long. I am in Southern California, where I moved some 20 years ago to pursue music ....which, after a car wreck in which I broke my neck, vanished as a choice in my life. I am stuck with chronic pain and memory problems, including speech problems. Most people never notice the speech problems, and the condition itself is known as Aphasia. I was a very intelligent person before the wreck, if a bit young and unfocused (hey..everyone deserves to be in their youth!). The wreck was in December of 1988 and took away any ability to play guitar I had worked so hard at. It makes it pretty hard to be a musician when you can't make music anymore.  Overall, I am in better shape mentaly now than I have been in many years. I have figured out the limitations of the injuries and begun to work around them. I have had about 15 years of my life ripped away by the problems it caused, and many of the issues I need to address are normally solved by people about 15 years younger than me. This is more than frustrating.  I can't seem to find work that is worth my time, so have become self-employed. At least I don't throw up every morning from the stress of submitting myself to a job I hate anymore.   I want a house of my own as a base to work from and get whatever I can done in this life. Cost of buying anything at all has always scared me away. I have come to the line of thought that I should do everything ,myself...so I am planning on purchasing land and building my own house. I don't mean paying contractors to build a house for me, I mean building it myself. In the end, the entire project should yeild an investment I can take loans against and the like...enabling me to pursue other interests.  I want to live near the base of the mountains nearby, as I seem to have a decent business started. I would rather live near the beach, but I have to start somewhere. I also am working on wrting novels, so once published look forward to something of an income from that. I am enough of a whore to be thinking in terms of the fact that its rather useless to write a book for arts sake, it IS a product after all, if I intend anyone else to see it.  I'm single, actually divorced, my ex is a friend who I stay in touch with and worry about as I do all my friends. She is a good person, timing and life were wrong for us to have been together. I don't like being single and want to find a woman who is artistic and has life goals. Maybe a writer, musician, artchitec or whatever. As for looks, I like a lot of people for who they are, but I would be hopeless to find a woman who looks like PJ Harvey or Joan Jett...someone skinny with dark hair about 30ish. Someone with drive like these two women would be a gift from the gods.  As I figure out how to work this blog I'll add links to useful sites about weird building techniques I study. In the end, hopefully it will become a record of how I did it, and I can turn it into a book for others who are a bit lost and don't know how to ever afford the concept of a house- or who want something outside the norm to live in.

      I haven't been avoiding this blog, I have been out doing research. Not exactly what I wanted to find in the end.  In short, alternative construction isn't really all that alternative. Its mostly based on stuff that has been done for centuries, but has fallen out of favor in the USA because of the cheap and easy availability of wood.  One straw bale book said "If you are looking for cheap housing ASAP, then straw bale is not for you. Buy a mobile home and put IT on a peice of land, it's the lowest debt method of owning housing." OK, I can see where that is correct.  A student turns out to be a contractor. I love talking to him, he's so cool. He told me land costs have gone up to like 5 times what they were even a year ago. What that means is I missed the boat. I can't AFFORD to live anywhere at all in Southern California now. I am thinking that the high desert may be the only option..before the building craze wipes it out too. I don't like deserts...but have to admit the air is cleaner, and with no mountains to lock in smog it will probably stay cleaner even with a zillion people there.   Alternative housing means trying to do the best for preserving the area, so if you have to commute a 100 miles a day, it becomes rather pointless anyway. It looks like my optons to do something good AND to have a comfortable home are slimming quickly. I beleive, in the end, that I need to build up my business, get it frnacised so I can travel and do set up, and live where ever I feel like. Probably somewhere in Northern California. I am not comforatbale in leaving the area business-wise yet. There is a great potential here for income. If I can get a bubble of decent income for the first time in my life I can get ahead enough to see the tunnel there is supposed to be light at the end of.

      I have been using the Palm Pilot I got to set taks and appointemnts. Much of the stuff I had to do is melting away. I am off to projects to make better my business. I placed an ad in a local business journal today, I was worried about spending the money, but you can't tell until you try....    I went to get my haircut, I love my hairdresser, she does such a good job. I also love my hairdressor because she is hot. Skimmy, sexy in just the way I like and intelligent in one pckage. She also drives like a maniac, having totaled a car after I last saw her..and she was recovering from the wreck she had just had. Tos ay I want to sleeep with her is a start. This is one tough woman, she could handle my crap I do believe.   One of my best friends called an hour ago to say he totaled his sports car. My other close friend did his a few months ago..my hairdressor has done it twice..I don't want to join this club any time soon.  I have been doing repairs to my Jeep so I can sell it. I am stuck for one major tool I need right now, but I hope to get things rolling soon on it. I have decided to do airbrushd graphics on the Jeep t raise the value before selling it. I don't know why I never thought of it before....  Need to get back to the book...

      ...since I put anything here. What have I been doing?  I have decided my 9-5 job is a waste of time, and started the wheels turing to get another one. I am aiming at being a writer and fencing coach (I am a coach to pay the bills now), with a minor interest in music. The job I am looking at has been paying a friend who used to be at my current job quite well. He is happy. I certainly could stand enough money to survive again.  I have decided all women all annoying as hell. I have also decided maybe I should never have a family. I have always held women to be equals, but have received nothing of the same sort of respect back. I am not dating until I have money in the bank to do what I want to in life. I'll be too old to date then anyway. I will be able to travel. Perhaps it's American women that are such pathetic losers. I don't want women as friends anymore either. I am tired of being father confessor to them. Maybe I should eb as abusive towards them as I see most men. I have been told to never change, that someone right will come along. It isn't working. To hell with all of them.   It's all about money and that's it. Money can buy happiness, because Donald Trump never seems to be depressed.  I am writing a book.  I am completly repairing my Jeep so I can sell it.  I am compleltly repairing my Escort so I can sell it also. Proceeds will go into business advertising and the Miata. Oh, and travel.  I am reformating the tower so I can get the music project going. I just want to complete my goals, I care not is anyone else approves of them.  I need to go to another country. or two or three.

      Looked at last year's blog and it was nothing but pathetic whining. I got rid of it, and with it all chance to llok at all that whining. Now no one sees my blog or has the address to it..ever again...unless they meet me THROUGH the blog.   It'll be sort of a daily journal of what I did with some related thoughts- as the last one just went too far off..and was whining.  There are books to write, lesson plans and tests to write and 9-5 stuff to get done for real. Let's make getting LIFE done the job...

      .     Well..I finally got the title to the car I bought in december. What a nightmare. I went to smog it this morning and thought it was going to fail. It finally passed..which is good, otherwise I can't get the title transfered into my name...     That done I blasted to DMV, who managed to find even more problems this time. Every time I go they find something else that wasn't done, can't be done or whatever. I just stood there and looked pathetic until they sorted it all out and I got my tags! Once on the car, it finally felt like MINE..even though I paid for it months ago. It was like having a lover who is fucking someone else besides you..you never know where you satnd. That's the worst kind of stress for me, and why I got sick and gained weight. Now all that's left is the tax mess from last year.    I traded in my cell phone today also, poor old warrior is retired. I got a new flip up one that is a bit smaller- and I can feel more like Captain Kirk with it. The ring goes off and it says "You have an incoming phone call"...I have to figure out how to change that, or begin refering to it as the HAL 9000. It's too erie.    I did something else major today but have forgotten what it is already. I am too busy. I wish to hell I had a wife or girlfriend to lean on sometimes. Just someone to chat with and snuggle up to on the sofa. Trouble is, women are afraid of commitment. They don't know how to do it. They all want a puppy that comes when they call, not an equal who has thoughts in their head. Maybe I should finish up the Jeep and the other car and sell them both and move to wherever....    I need to get money to a friend to get his old header and muffler from him. That will boost the HP of the car about 15% or so. I need all the power I can get. I had fun last night when some college geek in his VW Turbo something or other thought he was gonna leave me behind. Whenever he sped up, I stayed the same exact distance behind him. He chickened out at 110 mph. Loser, daddy must be paying for it all, because no one that young is driving a car like that and paying for their own college. If I had that kind of money, I wouldn't be going to college, I would be starting the production comapny I want to have.....  Sex.

      .     It seems like the week or weird problems already. I had a claim denied that seemed perfectly legit to me. I'll have to call and see if I can push it through. I also had a call that the karate class is pulling out of the Riverside location, so I have been offered additional nights. I am thinking I should move the failing Epee class to Wed nights, and in the second hour add a Sabre class. I have to be able to balance this against the other classes...and not undercut them. I guess we will see what we can do. I had considered burning down th Redlands class, but it DOES bring in SOME income..no matter how frustrating it is. Then again, giving up Wed might fill out Riverside to the point thatiI CAN close Redlands.    Awoke to mad dreams of my girl in LA. Don't know what to think of it all. Do I have time to chase her? I doubt it...then again, she hasn't worked in a year or more- living off money from her mother's passing away..and the sale of her house I think. I need my life to move forward. One thing though, I haven't scared her away like every other female I ever meet. Maybe that means something too.    Mad Racket....the words keep popping back into my head. A song by Krokus back in the early '80's.    My title for the car should be here today- if so I get to pick up my tags also. To have this all done will be a godsend, I hope it works out soon!!!     Cross my fingers for change...

      .    Well, it's time to get moving again. the weekend was a diaster. As ever, the divsion took forever to run a most simple competition which destroyed my weekend timewise.     I drove some today. I almost went to LA, as my mind has been full of a certain woman there. She is a friend I have always want to by with. I would die for a kiss...people die for much less most of the time. The dreams that wake me about her are back, so I better call her and make sure she is OK.     Time to get organzied again and get rolling. Need to FINISH the ever-increasing Jeep Project and move on it also. The apartment is begging to be finished, and I have hit on a design direction after much watching of the Home Version of Extreme Make-Over. I love that show. It finally struck me how much I need a house...to have something to work on as therapy.....  I would if I can write a house off as a medical expense?

      .  Well...it appears this is working again. I have no idea about html, but figured it out by reading it line by line, hitting preveiw and seeing what changed what. Life is too busy....     I have blown off working at RenFaire this year. I just don't care to tell the truth. It's too tiring, and I already teach fencing 4 night s week. The last thing I would do to relax is fence two more days during the week. The Long Beach Grand Prix is the same weekend as Faire opens, guess where I'll be?     Today is an air show, the Redlands Bike Classic and a Competition I need to coach at. It was also the yearly booth meeting. What kind of fool runs a fencing booth and then schedules a mandatory meeting on the same day as two differant divsions yearly qualifing events and then expects people to show up..on pain of not getting the yearly pass? I decided that was the last straw. How stupid....the people that work the booth, by and large, are non-fencers...with an inflated sense of their own abilites. One of the current head people..who has less than half the years I do in...has never fenced a competition..yet thinks he is too good to go to most clubs around the state. What an idiot.      I don't even care about chasing women there this year. The older I get, the more I only find women with 4 kids by 4 differant guys- who want someone to pay all their bills so they can sit home with their drug drenched kids and bitch and complain. Then they feel like never having sex because "They have rights" or something..??!?!?!?!? I think maybe I should buy a useful and friendly younger woman from over seas somewhere..someone who would apprieciate just being cared for as a person...    The overbearing stillness that felt like death has moved on. It could be the Overbearing Noise of Freeway Construction that has shattered all calm for weeks. Or the noise of the high school next door. Now that they put up the tarps blocking veiw of the feild next door I can no longer lust after the dykey looking girls coaches and their short hair and hot bodies...oh well...the Crazy Cat Woman loves it because she thinks the police are not spying on her anymore. Dumb bitch. Why can't I EVER have sexy and horny neighbors?     Jeep projects went well until I burned the brand new paint off the sides with the brand new bufer. Oh well, time to start over.

        .           Morning pulled the veil awake and Death has slide back to the dark of tunnels, of pathways, of behind trees and under things. Death is not resting, Death is just waiting. Death peers out from where He sits. Death peers out from where She sits. Will cats wander in and be crushed? Other animals more aware stay away.   Yes....Death is STILL Close At Hand.

      Death stalks about tonight. He pranced in at nightfall and I felt him smile over me in Riverside. I felt him spread out over the city hiding behind the veil we call darkness, and nobody saw him but me. I am not depressed in that way, I do not long for my own end or others- but I know his face, I know his talk and I feel him breathing on me again.    Something big is about, something bigger than most times. Something that is a misbalance in the very force of life, allowing death his waltz. I have no words for it, and facing it, find myself much more calm than I could ever imagine myself to be. Maybe it is come for me. Maybe not, but it has come.   There is so much I have yet to do, so much I have yet to see, but instead we must dance yet again. I am well past hate with this mental exhaustion. I know Him too well. I drove his old hunting grounds and he was looking at me, puzzling against me to scramble my thoughts.He does well doesn't he?  It has been so still, not just the freeway which has been exploded in workmen's noise all night for a week or two...but the very earth itself is still, waiting for more death to drift towards it and refresh it with bodies to digest. I hope someone survives this. I wonder if things come to soon because something has been set akimbo somewhere else?  I can look and almost see everytime I turn at night. Like some translucent monster with no face but a hulking body Death sits there, ready to twirl away and make me wonder. Ready to make me search the papers for his night journeys. Werewolvian in his pursuits. Hidden during the day and breathing and alive at night. Making the peacefulness wicked..no...clear. Something to fall through on the way to somewhere else.  I feel like I need to be in India or some place balanced with beliefs. Someplace spinning madly out of time with this world, where radio is the only contact to keep you alive.  I feel so lost. But I feel...Death..closer again at hand.

      I feel death close at hand. I myself was struggling for breathe for the last many weeks. I had another blog, actually two, that I got sick of.In one way I am glad I dumped them both. They seemed to revolve around meeting a woman, falling madly in love with her and then being rejected by them. I am everybody's best friend. I need to be more of a snake in the grass. Women think they want a nice guy, but they really want a devious bastard who would fuck their sister in an instant. Then thye have a goal of keeping him at home with their charms. If they know he is going to stay there already, there is no challenge.    Why can't there be women who want something more than Jerry Springer Trailer Trash Lives? I used to think they existed. The nutcase next door is letting her cats out all the time and acting like they are not hers, she has a constant stream of middle age black men going to her place (she is skinny and white) at all hours of the night. Just try and tell me she isn't dealing drugs again....    So much for that. Something bigger is in the air. The whole earth feels like it, like some grand event is unfolding and the earth is breathing litghtly to be ready. Perhaps the ascent of mankind to a new higher level? Perhaps the end of mankind? All I know is that the only words I have is that I feel Death Close At Hand at every instant.    I am working away on many projects, I am down to like 4 important ones. Oncethey are done I can breathe deeper myself. Travel would be good, my restless roots are bound in a pot lived in too long. I may blow off this weekend and drive as far north as I can to see how far I can get. I may not. I don't know.    Faire is coming, and I really don't care this year at all. I said yes to working, maybe I'll quit half way through. That would be a change, taking the control of my working back away from the booth owner....    I have airbrushing to do, a Jeep to finish repairs on (it's getting close to being only small repairs..YEAH!!!), paperwork and taxes to do (oh crap...), and testing to write. Sex doesn't even enter into it right now. I don't know why.    My stomach feels better for the first time in months with the addition of acidopholis to my diet, and a severe reduction in the amount and types of food I eat. I am eating one meal a day is all. I was eating too much crap.    Didn't try and pick up a bimbo, instead I started reading a book by Arundhati Roy. It is densely written and confusing, giving glimpses of things and then thrown al out of chronological order. All the things they tell you to never do in fiction. Screw "Them". I write much more straightforward than I like to. I write like Hemingway, like a newspaper man who wants more. I don't really like my writing ...yet.   Write On.

      I see everything and I want to paint it...not black..but a touch wouldn't be bad. I am doing much bodywork on my vintage Jeep so that I may seel it. I intend to go to Scotland with some of the money. I also think maybe I should go to like Thailand and sleeze around with any girl who breathes. Why not? The president can blow up half the planet and act like it don't matter? Sex sure doesn't in the long run...!  Until then, I study and learn about airbrushes and come up with mad schemes to paint everything I own.  I went with a friend who wanted to flirt with a waitress. I find her attractive, but heard she had a BF. She said something nice to him, and he choked completly..leaving ME to carry the conversation. Now the woman and I are exchanging CD's and the like....it's not like I planned this....she is, however, highly attractive. I have found she lives with mommy, and she is a bot old for that. She doesn't seem to want to do so but is. That tells me Mr BF ain't all that much. Maybe I should go along farther. Friday I was going to ask her to coffee, but timing was bad. I will yet. I have to finish so many projects quickly! I need time and space to move forward.  I have discovered "Beaming" on my Palm. I now am a danger to the free world.  Wonder if I could pick up a bimbo in a pub on a Sunday...?

      .    OK..pet peeve. I am SICK to death of hearing, "Well so and so has a DEGREE in (Insert something uselss here...Biz Management, Admin, Logistics, Accounting, etc) so they are more qualified for any job than (Insert name of someone with years on the job who KNOWS what they are doing..)."     The last manager I had was actually pretty damn cool as a person, but after years as a salemen, he got a degree in Logistics and decided he knew how to run warehouses and production lines. When presented with real world supply issues control by companies other than our own, he simply expected them to change to suit our disorganziation....    Worse is the College Student themselves. The NEXT time I hear some wet behind the ears child going on at length about how everyone on the planet deserves as much as everyone else I am going to level them. I am going to jump into their loudly put so everyone can hear them conversation and make them the ass they are.    WHY is it that these rich kids..I mean, going to school instead of working is not a RIGHT..and MOST people never get a chance to do so....think that from their rich little back grounds they can tell everyone else what to do? I will, and mark my words..NEVER hire a college grad at any of my companies. I want someone who was working, fighting, clawing and learning in the REAL world to learn what my company does..while THEY were going to frat parties, getting bombed or getting preggars.    Another good one: "There should be a cap on what EVERYBODY makes..so money can be spread around to take care of everyone.." Great..no problem, let's set it at about 30k a year..what? Can't afford college now? Too bad, somebody with 6 kids is sure to have the seventh child never find itself hungry again...yu don't NEED college anyway. Want a BMW and can't afford it now? So...someone else doesn't have to worry about paying for health insurance because YOU did it for them. What do you mean you don't feel like its worth going to work? What about everybody else? They need YOUR money..get off your ass and get to work!    Darwin was right- the struggle for survival is SUPPOSED to weed out the loser from the gene pool. When you upset the way of the world you end up with morons like GWB at the TOP of the food chain somehow.     A few years ago a guy walks into my Fencing Studio and announces he wants to take Fencing so he can beat everyone in his SCA group. Then he tells me that only the SCA really knows what they are doing with edged weapons. THEN, he asks if I can give a poor, struggling college student a discount so he can afford to take lessons from me.       So I looked into the empty parking lot at his BRAND NEW BMW, looked at him as he kept going on and on about what HE needed, and how he was going to leave as soon as he beat his SCA'ers at their thing and said, 'SCA? So if THEY are the only ones who know anything about swordpaly, then WHY the hell are you here? Doesn't that logic rather negate your last staement..and as for  being a POOR college student...if you are going to college at ALL you are a fucking rich kid and won't admit it. Next..you're driving a brand new BMW worth more than everything I won put together...how DARE you come in here and and try and tell my you are either POOR OR STRUGGLING. Sell your fucking Kraut car if you ahven't got money...and DON'T EVER walk back in my fucking door..now LEAVE before I throw you're two bit ass out in the parking lot...NOW...!"    Of course, the business partner at the time, with her BA in Management (who couldn't produce an Income/ Expense sheet in 5 years..didn't understand advertising, hadn't a clue about building  a set of functioning lesson plans around our rented time schedule..and spent extra money on an 800 phone number we didn't need...) was VERY upset with me.    It's simple..public or private, schools are in business to sell an education. If not enough people make it to the end..they lose money from drop outs. If the person comes out at the end with no clue about their chosen field, no problem..it's brushed off as some people just don;t make it in their chosen feilds..BUT..student laons can never be bankrup[ted out of....very nice for them...!     A few centruires back, if someone needed a skill that required special study, there were Guilds to educate and certify them. They simply didn't LET people who didn't know what they were doing get cetified, because it made them ALL look bad. Somewhere along the line it got mutated into a College System...when Guildsmen discovered that the selling of an education was a business in itself.  Ban Colleges, bring back Guilds!

      .     Just barely. All it seems I have done is sleep. I have to go to work tomorrow during the day, what a drag. Maybe I'll feel better by then. Got word my father is in the hospital, but doing OK. Gee, maybe when he went in 3 days ago it would have been a good time to call me.....     I am going to Faire this weekend with an ex fuck buddy. I think she wants sex again, but I just don't care one way or another. I am so sick of all the crap that it takes to be involved with someone...I wonder if I'll ever run into the "right" person. As for now..I have no hope of it at all.     Patti Smith was just on TV. That's the kind of woman I always hoped to meet, a smart, artistic and productive woman. A tough woman...not one of those fluffy doing crafts at home and calling herself an artist type that seem to abound.  Oh well, need to get rolling on life for the day.

      .       This has been a pretty bad bout. I get grumpy when I am sick, I just want to get past it. If it gets bad enough, I feel crappy so I get wholesale angry at everything- as if to drive away the sickness. I have been throwing up since Thursday, couldn't sleep at all. Then I woke up Sunday morning bright and early wired like a speed freak with a couple of extra doses.     I got so much done on Sunday it was bizarre. I even got to sorting out 25 years worth of handwritten short stories, poems, novel drafts and god only knows what else. years ago I finished a novel I thouyght was a good idea, but written rather clunky. I had a woman (the same bitch I was angered about the other day) who INSISTED that she take the handwritten drafts and enter them into a Word format. This way I could edit/ publish..do something with them. SIX YEARS later when I got sick of getting screwed under (I may be slow, but a major head injury does that to people) and stopped putting my dick in her, I DEMANDED the work back. All the while she had been saying how she got a little time in to work on it here and there. I had expected a file with some 150 pages entered. She returned only FOUR of FIVE notebooks, and then INSISTED I was wrong about the count. Last night, I finally got a program to read whatever bizarre program she had used to make the floppy of all that hard work she did in SIX YEARS and discovered a TOTAL of NINE PAGES had been entered..and..OF COURSE, the missing notebook is the FIRST one...with all the set-up for the whole book. Lucky enough, it's the only major part of the novel I remember by heart and can rebuild from memory.    The OTHER problem is, when I ran out of paper during another writing project, I wrote one third of a long short story on the BACK side of the pages from this story...so this stupid, selffish bitch lost the intro to one novel, and a third of a short story..and had the nerve to tell ME I was wrong on the count. Christ, how stupid would I have to be to write FIVE binders full of stuff and think it was only FOUR....?!?!?!?!?     Iam SO tired of seeing TV shows where every woman got the short end of the stick, and every man is a loser wioth no brain. I used to hate Alannis Morrisette because of "You Ought to Know"...I know a goodly number of fairly straight forward guys who got major screwed by women. You know, married 27 years, she goes back to school on his dime, meets some younger doper/ fake artist type who beds her..so she divorces and takes half of his income...even though she hasn't WORKED in 20 or more years. I will NEVER marry a woman that doesn't work. If she doesn't, she is no better than a domestic whore. She better be ready to be on her back at a moment's notice...because she is selling HERSELF short to be a "Stay at home" mother. Before we got to this place in the world, mothers had to work all the time too...forging for food, making shelter..doing more than banging the pool boy- eating too much and driving a wasteful car around with a number of bad tempered, ill natured children they aren't really guiding.    I want to see a TV show where some stay at home mother who never did anything LOSES the custody of the kids because she is no better than a vampire, and then gets NO alimony, because HE needs it to raise the kids. I could do a damn site better job of raising kids than most of the druggies I see in this area.    Yeah- maybe I AM angry. Maybe having two years of work lost, and then getting told i was full of shit makes me this pissed. One thing I know- I never thought this novel was good enough to publish- but I NOW understand how to edit it and fix the issues in it...and I WILL get it published to spite this bitch among other things........I will make good on my promise to myself to be a writer.

      .  I need music. I need something to listen to. I need something new, that doesn't sound like something old. I need something olkd only as a matter of record and archives. I need music. I can walk into Amoeba and in a place THAT big still find NOTHING of interest to listen to. I think I need to go to Austrailia or something. Or maybe ..no...I won't say it. It would just curse me from ever having it happen.  I wonder what my friend who is in Cebu is doing now...probably another nurse. I wonder if he will come back, or if he will move there and work his job via the internet as he probably could.

      .   ...I just don't know what I want anymoire. All I ever wanted was to play guitar, make music, tour and live a simple life saying nice things overall. Instead, I got a lifetime of jobs I hated, more injuries to my body than half a football team and nobody to lean on next to me on the sofa at night. Everyone who knows me goes on about how nice it must be to be single. Great....I look that happy?!?!?!?  The grass is always greener on the other side. When I was married I got a number of the injuries, so it never really had a chance. My wife is very intelligent, but in many ways simply not my "type". I hate that fact. She is a really cool person overall- and the best thing I managed to do this life so far was to leave her...she finally had to work and stand up for herself when I did..and she is exactly as solid as I wish she had been when we were married. I wish she would find someone and get married again...then again, she is from a big family and all she ever wanted to do was be left alone. Doesn't work too well for an only kid who just wants a touch of attention......life sucks.  Life would be much better if I didn't hurt from head to toe for god only knows what reason. I wish I were in the south pacific or someplace...with warm salt water all around..and I could just swim and soak these pains away. I miss not living near the beach.   really should be working on writing a novel..not a blog...

      .    It's like 2 in the morning, I live less than an 1/8 of a mile from a freeway- and for WEEKS they have been blocking it off at 10:00 pm, just in time to screw up my drive home after work...and then fucking working on it all night. NO ONE can tell what the hell they are doing. They are cutting huge slabs out of it, and then filling them in with concrete before morning.     CalTrans has got to be the biggest bunch of idiots on the planet. EVERY project they do takes FOREVER. I am really wondering why the hell I ever left Florida...oh yeah. before I broke my neck I played guitar and sang and was working on a band...DUH...figures something on a road like a car wreck would destroy my dreams. Probably CalTrans fault for the way the road crowned so high in the middle and then almost curved off into the curb...other wise the damn other care would have hit us BEHIND the front door I was sitting behind.    Ever break your neck? No..not front to back the EASY way...sideays, by smashing your head through the sidewindow of a car, and then bouncing the same head off the hood of the OTHER car as it crumples up and throws your carcass back into the car you were in...Yeah. It fucking sucks.    I need more. I need a house. If I can't find a woman and a family, I need a fucking place to build cars. Maybe I'll drift one off a cliff somewhere and go out in a blaze of glory. Am I 20 and full of shit and talking  tough? No, I am 42 and tired of trying so hard at things I don't give a crap about- which leaves me too tired to do what I want to do....crew the USA. I wish to hell I had been born in Europe..I always have.    I spent most of last night throwing up, even when nothing was left. It's fatal, but I keep hoping something would just burst, and I would slowly fade out and be found blood-free and gone at some point after I hadn't paid my rent. My stomach hurts all the time and has for 6 months. I can't eat anything without getting sick, and I have no insurance to go get it checked out. It makes no sense at all. It's what's putting me in such an angrey and frustarted mindset. Haven't I been sick and injuried ENOUGH in this life...???When do I get a break at anything?    Wish I had something high caliber with a scope so I could shut fucking Caltrans down. Assholes. I wish I knew where the project manager lived- I'd go mow all his neighbors lawns for free...non-stop- until the project by MY home where I can't sleep is done. Beat THAT would speed it up....

      .      God..I wonder what looked at me. I have felt like creeping death for days. Drove to Palm Springs yesterday for work, did 15 minutes, drove back and went to bed until I HAD to get up and go teach. Later, I was awoken by the overwhelming need to be sick.      There is no time lonleier than when you are sick. The last...bitch...because I can't call her a woman, I was involved with ignored my pleas for her to come over and help me when I was sick one time. Not a little sick, that never bothers me...but sick enough to barely be able to get out of bed. She gave me a list of all these important things she had to do and why she couldn't possibly come over. I nearly died that night ..I was puyking blood and just laid on the bathroom floor for hours, wrapped in a blanket and tring to get warm. I couldn't have possibly driven to the hospital. I still hate this bitch's guts.    It's alway men who are painted to look so bad. I am so sick of the USA, I don't care if I was born here. The women are mostly evil and heartless. They all want to be equal with men, but don't want the responsiblity of actually being equal. In other words, they want the benefits without the work. I hated working 9-5 jobs. The women were CONSTANTLY gone or LATE. It was always "My kid this or that.." Since I had no kids, OF COURSE, I was expected to work late, carry the work load and do what they didn't do. Then one of the bitches made such a fuss I got fired. That's fine, I hated the place anyway. As I walked out the door she actually said, "They fired YOU..crap, I wanted them to fire RAY..." who..of course, was sitting 8 feet from her.....     I have begun to think that women don't belong in the workplace. The boss at the last place had everything running great, and then we got forced into a room with a department full of women. His first words were "This is the beginning of the end..." and he began to look for other work. Good deal, as he was so right. He got fired...mostly because of a loud mouthed, over-weight, sub intelligent girl who thougt she knew everything..she NEVER stopped talking. he had screwed exactly one weedy looking ittle boy, but thought she was some kind of goddess. She managed to get him to marry her....what a fucking loser. Too stupid to even go whoring instead of getting latched onto by this vampire.  ...she was SSOOO proud of her...HONDA! She thought it was a race car because it had 17" wheels. Gee..I wonder if she realizes that that threw off the suspension geometry so bad that it now handled worse than new. Srings, sway bars and shocks...? What are those...?!?!?!?!    Last time I checked, she was some sort of Jr manager at the place, and everyone was scared of her. She have a lifetime job there, because her fat size intemidates everyone. She even throws punches at people and shoves them around when she feels like. She started to shove me once and I told her her she laid a finger on me they would never find her body in no uncertain terms. Of course, I got in trouble, so instead of signing the sheet that I was being written up I told the boss's that if they insisted on writting me up, I was going legal for jobplace harrassement and suing the shit out of them. I included that if she came within 20 feet of me, or ever tried to talk to me again I would consider it grounds- then I mentioned the name of the law firm I use. They just didn't get it that I had been running my own business on the side for 8 years already and didn't think like a victum at work..I thought like a business owner..you threaten me and I'll kick your ass.    I am so sick of all of this. There are NO good women to find anywhere. I used to enjoy the company of women a lot more than men, until I realized that I had become Father Confessor to all of them. Why do women pick a nice guy and tell him all their problems and look to him for answers...then ignore the fact that HE may like them, and desire to treat them with respect..and instead get involved with morons who want nothing more than a blow job or a quick fuck? To hell with all of them. To hell with even being alive.  The blog is called "No More Pathetic Crap"..but I feel like SHIT right now so I'll write what I want to.

I can't seem to drum up new students for the next classes. Things are pretty dire- might ven have to go back to a 9-5 job. Oh well. I have an appointment some 2 weeks off during  the day, and 2 weeks after that to follow up. I really don't give a crap about that 9-5 job anymore. Need a change.    Been working on cars and computers for weeks. I have nothing else to focus/ live for. Trying to get all the old projects out of the way so I an move on soon. Back to the current projects. Rain today prevents any type of painting. Sure glad I am not working fair and stuck in the rain with my boots and swords....last year it took a week to clean them all up....  Need to drive........

      .      Last weekend my dear friend came from up north, spouting starry eyed crap about how nice it would be if no one was rich, and everyone had to share everything. Strong words from a woman whose family lives on top of a major prime piece of real estate, in a wonderful house, who has never been at want for anything. I hope I didn't scare her off. I treasure her like she was my own, but just have a hard time with all the "Love and Peace" ideals coming out of Northern California..when you see it propped up by strong commerce they don't wanna talk about. It's simple..it takes MONEY to do things. Money isn't evil, misuse of the power it can buy is....I felt beat up, grumpy and old. Her child has major hair now, so I felt even older. He weighs as much as a good bag of grass seed now. I have no idea why that thought sticks with me.     The woman I seem to be pining for in LA may not be in good shape. The parents of a friend who she used to date were found dead in their home. I can't raise her by phone, don't know if she's in the state or not but really want to check in with her.      I have been aghast at what happens in Iraq. Four "Contractors" were killed and a mob abused their bodies. The news doesn't bother to say what KIND of contractors..so the USA is up in arms with the thought that a couple of carpenters or electricians working hard to rebuild bombed out housing were killed. You track it down, they were some sort of legal mercenaries. Former Seals and stuff. I have no doubts they were running around like John Wayne, flashing their firepower and acting touch and got the crowd pissed at them. There are many fine people in special forces...but it is a trade where you KILL people. It is a trade where you have a mojor chance of getting killed yourself...I can't feel sorry for people that get out of it and then GO PRIVATE doing the same thing! I have a friend in the know...won't say why, that says pay is in the thousands of dollars per day to these kinds of people. I knew mercs in the early '80's and have no doubt of it.     So the US military is puffing out their chest and saying, "This is no Vietnam, the people fighting here have no Superpower backing them up...". Oh god....does every one killed at Pearl Harbor roll over in their graves every time the military completely misses the obvious? The way the USA has missed the point on global issues for the last 105 years is amazing. Now..they are tromping on Iraq for revenge...killing woman and children..and people say, "Well, if they kill ours, we kill theirs and show 'em whose in charge! They won't try THAT  again..." Christ! Does anybody remember that 200 years ago or so there were w bunch of people living HERE that were rally sick of the British running around in what we considered OURS..telling us what to do? Why was the War of 1776 "Right" and when Iraq's stand up for themselves it's "Wrong"...?!?!?!       I can only hope that that hell rains down on those who start wars like this. that their souls never get rest, and their families suffer with them at least as much as the suffering of the families they destroy. When my parents, so conservative that even the 1950's were a little to sexy think the USA is being lead by a madman then something major is wrong..something very, very major.     I saw Condleeza Rice speak in front of some jury. She said nothing what so ever in her whole sitting. She sounds just like the president. They ALL sound like the plague on this land, middle management...those educated with degrees folks who couldn't figure out how to turn on their own computers and use the company programs if their children were being held hostage by their wives yoga instructors. Middle Management. What a farce. People with degrees who have NEVER works a day in their lives. When the rest of us were out running business's, their only thoughts were when the next party was...and they get paid 4 times what we make...  ...that said, maybe this country being torn apart by Islam wouldn't be such a bad thing. Have these middle managers from hell done the math? No..it's not a lonely Superpower "Backing Up" Iraq..this is a Holy War these morons are starting...I see it, if a stupid American sees it then I'll be damned sure that Islamic folks tired of being crapped on see it! Yeah..Vietnam, two Superpowers fighting over a tiny country...but now, the USA, with 5% of the world's population is pissing off more than 50% of the globe...the Islamic folks. Guess in the end it WILL be the Book Of Revelations being played out. Maybe it's the end of the world as it was to be known to Christians...the end of the world doesn't need to mean the end of the actual world..it can mean the end of everything as it's known...just ask the Greeks or Romans about it.   Pray for someone..anyone else...to be "Elected" at the next US elections...stop the madness or pray for Assassing...

I still need to look at masks and see what I need to do for and with them. I guess I'll mark them also....     I must feel a little better, having gotten some stuff done. It would be stupid, but it feels like my body is already starting to re-propotion itself a touch. Clothing is chaning in the way it fits. Good deal..soon I will be back into my good clothing.    I expect to have all my projects done in 10 days. Then I will only have on-going projects like Fencing, Writing and Music to deal with. Miata projects will all be easy or quick at this point. In a year I plan to got an engine from Fling Miata and build it to be able to do a supercharger. I will start scouting for a 6 speed transmisson also. When I go to do it all, I will have it all sitting there, brand new and ready to swap into place. Then Project Miata will be done.   Time to go teach....

      .    I am feeling somewhat better after the weekend. My system woke and and seems to have purged out the toxins and stuff. The result was a massive headache all weekend long. Today I finally awoke feeling...*gasp*..."Good". That would be the first time I call myself feeling good in the morning in a year.     The horrible side effect of all of this is that I have begun to notice females again. BUT..only fit ones. I am noticing only females half my age, and while in public they all seem to say they don't want an "old Guy"...it funny how many get naked ASAP when the offer comes along. The problem is, everyone is just a person. Every person has a certain sex drive and every person can be triggered. It's gotten to the point of being a big so what to me now. Maybe I need a TJ weekend of sleezy and easy sex with these females half my age. A few years ago when I did so it was easy enough, and these females half my age never batted an eye when I hit on them. And the said "yes".     OK..instead of dreaming of banging half the town (but no one in my neighborhood, as they are all old and worn out chain smokers for the most part...) that is half my age, I have projects to complete today...

      .    Well..it seems time for change. Two years ago I lost 80 pounds, because I was badly out of shape and hated myself for it. All the TV shows with surgery to lose weight...idiots. It takes WILLPOWER to do so. You have to care about feeling better. People don't get that fat withou a lot of work at it. I sure didn't...     So two years ago I was at the best fitness level of my adult life, and then I injured myself in a demo of fencing..in front of 400 people. I couldn't let them see the pain, so I didn't. I thought I was going to die- but worse, the injury to my legs kept me from my pre-appointed schedule of walking, with which I had fallen in love. Top it off with having been fired from my 9-5 the week before, and no insurance to cover a doctor visit. Bummer...     So I kept off most of the weight until about 6 months ago when I got sick. A total of 20 or so pounds came back and it's too much. A close friend lost about what I did two years ago and kept it off with herbalife products. So....here I go trying them. His claims of pretty instant raise in energy levels seem to be true. Otherwise I would be asleep now! It's close to the way I was eating on my own, with a lot less hassle. I figure taking myself down to a good level this way, and changing overall to keep fit. I will lose 50 total pounds, and I know I can do it. THAT will put me at a lower weight than in high school 25 years ago. I hope like hell there are reunions planned somtime soon after that!     A friend from out of town visited yesterday, she is a sweetheart but so young. She wants to save the world, but is so naive at how to do so. "Nobody needs to be rich! That's wrong!" Geez....start with your parents girl...they have a very expensive home, anything they want, fancy cars...not everybody's parents get a new Benz every few years....I love her dearly, but she hasn't yet figured out that saving the world is done one person at a time, and that means yourself first. I certianly have tried to save enough people who didn;t want to be saved. Christ, the USA is trying to do that to Iraq right now....what a waste.    Anyway, gotta get healthy. I have a lot to acheive in the next 4 months.

      .    Geez...I love cheese. I love Ice Cream. I don't love my lactise intolerance that makes everything go bad in my system. I don't like the way I feel after last nights Mexican food- as tasty as it was. Too much Cheese. Damn it.    Someone IM'ed me yesterday. Someone I was screwing a year ago who dumped me for another guy. I was lead to beleive that soon after, the other guy thought he had "won" some unstated contest, so he then dumped her. That kinda sucks. it was OK for me, as we didn't have a lot in common other than getting naked and screwing ourselves silly. Sounds like maybe it's time for a yearly hump weekend or something. Whatever, I can't waste too much effort of realtionships right now. Too many things to do.    I was hoping a friend would have written a program for me by now to track all my issues with the business, but he has discovereda girlfriend and has done nothing ever since. Oh well, it's cool he is happy. I guess that gives me some hope in the big picture.      All the rqin the last few days has driven all the plants into blooming. I finally figured it out. In Florida, it rains all the time and that keeps the pollen count way down, even though more stuff blooms. Here, it rains and drys up- so the pollen goes crazy for weeks. I am dying. Today sucks on a pyshical level so far.

      .    I have spent all day trying to sort out my data enty for last years taxes. Usually I turn it all in to my accountant by the end of January...but that's because they send me a notice for an appointment. Last year, the day after I picked up my taxes..he died. The new comapny didn't send out a notice with a time- just a generic notice months ago. I forgot I had to get them together.    I awoke in the middle of a dream about my girl in LA. I have known her so long, and find her very attractive. She., like me, is an only child, which means she's all fucked up in the head too. I have always wanted to seduce her, and last time we got together told her I have fallen madly in and out of love with her for years. It's true. I honestly think a good week of shagging each other silly would be all the world for both of us. I am debating following through and finallt trying to seduce her. Hard part...she's now in her early 30's and has never been with anyone before. That so sucks. I so wanna change that.    Her mother died a couple of years ago, and she doesn't talk to her dad.  I know she is lonely, it comes off her like a wave. She has told me before she wanted a family, but I think she is too awkward to go do it. Maybe Ihave been too. She hasn't worked in a few years, so if I can break down her walls, I will drag her home for an extended shag afterwards....     It started raining, and I couldn't see it because I was wearing my reading specs. That sucks, wet car inside now. I have to finish the taxes tonight, no matter what. I am missing the bills for the computer I bought to get the business running better..and the police report of all my equipment being stolen. Great- I guess I'll be up all night again.  I wish she were here taking my mind of things.

         Not a single person called or e-mailed me today. They were all out with their friends I would guess, or families. The Crazy Cat Woman that attacked the neighbor had visitors all day. Some cool, some who looked like maybe they were drug dealers. She did get busted a few years ago....     Seems everytime I get in place to work from home and make a lot fo phone calls, she is outsiude screaming for her cats or running some sort of machine to refinish some sort of broken crap she has pulled from the trash. It sounds really professional, and I have even had people ask what all the weird yelling is about. I figure that if she is such a pest during my important times, I'll return the favor. As soon as I see a group showing up, I run out to the garage and open the door and turn on the air compressor or power sander for the next couple of hours.     Whn they come outside for a smoke, I begin to airbrush with nasty smelling paint which happens to blow their way. You get the picture. Return the favor to them, these kinds of people keep acting like the whole world is out to get them, maybe it's time to put some teeth in their paranoia.    Still, I got a major amout of work done on the jeep. The hood has been wet sanded and readied for a next color coat. I thinhk it will come out looking good. I then painted 90% of the undercarriage on the thing. It was cleaned some time back and needed to be shot. The front of a jeep has a small flat area between the frame rails. Mine was rusted badly under the cheap paint thrown on years ago by somebody. Now it has been sanded to bare metal, primed and color coated. Tomorrow morning I will top it with a clear coat and it will be like it rolled off the show room floor...actually better. They didn't pay attention to this area much in 1977, just ugly flat black back then, I mean, it was a jeep? Who ever looked at them close anyway?    I need a haircut badly, I have come to the polace of considering myslef a writer, not a musician, so I can afford to shorten and make things easier to care for. Thanks Courtney Love, for pointing out that among the artists, writers of novels get paid best of all. Maybe I can take you to dinner sometime after I get my first sale of a work. Yeah, the kid could come to, looks like you do a great job with her, no matter what everyone else thinks.    OK, shower time and then write for some hours. I passed 68,000 words last night, need to make it to 75,000 tonight if I can. I will have to go back and compeltly rewrite the first 60,000 words, I have learned a lot about plots and character interplay in the last two weeks. I can see how to make my characters stronger and it will help the story line. Why am I writing? Because I CAN.

      The trouble with writing a novel based lossely on your life as a time frame is that it digs up lots of painful old memories you thought you had buried. The story really has gotten away from being a true telling of things, but I had to dig deep and try to remember how I felt when I was young and invicible. The memories of it hurt like hell.  I wondered where I lost my way, but I know, it was the damn car wreck that just fucked me beyond belief. I finally got back to my own head enough oto become something of who I was, to find I had changed so much I didn't know myself at all anymore. Reading the pages written during the heady days of NaMo I don't even remember half of what I wrote. It all works, but I will have to go back twice to turn it all into something of merit.  I used to know what I wanted, a band that made good musc, increasing skills in production and a wife and family to make it all worthwhile. Its those realizations that cut like hell to have float to the surface as I dredge deeper than I expected to.   A least I am into an acion based section, talk about giving a hero something to overcome in your story. God, how am I still alive? There is so much I have lived through, since people don't beleive me, I might as well recast it and use it as ficton. Maybe the payoff will be travel and the next part of my life.  Death in the shadows will wound you, he'll maim you, he'll KILL you...for long forgotten cause. I remember that as the man who wrote it has had enough and run off to be an actor instead of a musician anymore. God I'll miss the way Fish writes. Best of luck to him as an actor, I think he'll be great at that too.  Sleep please please take me to you tonight!!

      I found an interesting book by an editor about writers, it offers advice as to what editors need from said writers. Its called "The Forest for the Trees".   It starts with a number of descriptions of writers and how insane and lonely they are. Hmm..I already figured that part out. Still, its been a fun read so far. It's by a woman who was an editor, so, from reading it, I had a mental picture of a woman who had spent some 40 or more years in the trade, and who dashed into things in the early 60's. I figured she would be rather old and quaint, with sort of a granny look to her. Nope, I looked at her website, she's younger than me and she's a babe. Of course, she has two books out now herself, which means she was too damn shy to just get out there and do it in the first place. She had to get a degree and work the trade first, before she loosened up enough to actually do what she started at as a child.     She makes a lot of good points, but paints all authors as New Yorkers with mental issues. I wish she could have met Martin Caiden. In some ways he was a hack, but what a wonderful hack! He wrote and published well over 100 books. He was larger than life in real life. I used to see him all the time at air shows, flying his restroed Junkers JU-52. HE is a good example of the kind of writer I aim to be. A working one....!    Yeah, I love the Beats and all that, but I have a southern voice myself, even though its hard to hear accents now, the sensabilites behind it remain the same. I figure to just write and then edit it into a decent form. Its the way I always work.    I see novel writing just like painting a car. First you do all the body work (outline) and get things in place where they should be. Then you sand it and blow a coat of primer on it (rough draft) and let it dry. Then wet sand it with paper down to 800 grit (First Edit). Then comes spraying a color coat (Second edit and read through start to finish). Color sanding and spot touch-up comes next (Second edit), and finally clear coat and polishing (Final edit and text made ready to send to editor. If the editor can find any flaws in the paint, its because they are better body workers than me, and thats why they get paid the tall dollar to do so. In the end, when the car rolls out the door we have money in our pockets and I look like the artists while they look like the manager.     Speaking of which. I got the entire hood of the Jeep painted today before I ran out of color. The next batch should be here on Tuesday or so. I can't beleive I have covered 90% of the thing with a quart of paint, and it looks good. I have to color sand and shoot a couple more coats on the hood to make it perfect, and then debate the whole custom graphic world. Of course I've never done that before, but thenm again, I've only written one novel and that isn't stopping me there either. I will be the author with the shinest cars of all.  Write on.

      Its true, I am caught in a blog. All of them. Mine, theirs, all of them. I am stuck, hiding from the reality of writing mnovels. I can pund out an impressive word count with little effort, it just takes moving the entire universe to actually get me started.  I am sick and tired of sitting in front of this screen doing nothing but blogging and surfing. I lost interest in most things a year ago.  I have been avoiding writing since the end of November, and become a great fencing teacher, a business man of sorts and a drop out to the world of 9-5 jobs. Problem is, I am not writing enough.   I put all my work that was handwritten (except the five notebook novel) into Word to wrangle into shape. I need to get up and ride them.  I can't sleep, and am getting out of shape. It's all stress, and it all started at the end of November. I need to complete what I started then.  I can't sleep tonight and need to go to LA for inspiration tomorrow. I need to go to Anaheim for supplies also. One and then the other I guess. Maybe I can shower and force sleep upon myself. The weird weather has screwed up my internal clock something awful!  Write on.

      The drive to Riverside, which even Mapquest says should take 18 minutes...is now taking AT LEAST an hour and a half, no matter what time of the day or night. Facts and figures say Riverside is the third fastest growing city in the US, so it's time to move back there and build the business located there. The other two locations need to be killed by December of this year.  Too damn cold and humid to do any painting without heat lamps and professional stuff, so today is a loss at that so far. The last of the demos is today, so I need to leave soon to make it to that. Need to do 9-5 job stuff but hate it so I have been putting it off. I need a new 9-5 job. Even part time mornings would be fine for now. Actually, that's not a bad idea either.....  I am thinking about tackling the concept of putting flames on the Jeep when I finish the basic repairs. It had factory bird decals that I had to take off (They were cracked, worn and faded out anyway). It looks too plain like it is...so maybe flames would be a good idea...?!?!?!?!?If I do get stupid and sell it, that would help some too I suppose...having a custom paint job.  Oh well, too much to do today better start on it. The Stout last night kicked my ass and I actually slept in with deep weird dreams most of the time.

        What a day, maybe I should be more angry more often. I blew the clear coat onto the jeep project, made one tiny mistake (I can sand it off and do it over anyway...) and later sanded the vintage (and worn out and cracked ) 1977 decal off the hood. It's done to 320 grit, so I need to cut it down to 1000 grit and primer it. That's tomorrow mornings project. I think I need a trip to Coast Airbrush for my soul....and other spiffy things I don't have now.    Got the testing for the first of my Level Two classes done- have to make the practical exam cards now. That shouldn't be too hard, I will cut/ paste them into what already exists for the first level. Maybe I can get the other two weapons written this weekend?    Mayhaps I can even write sometime soon. It does feel good to make progress. I am so easily bored, but need a challenge.....     Seems like a good thing to swear off dating per say right now. Oh wait, tomorrow I have demos to do.,..better focus on them....not that that has anything to do with dating...just thinking about managing my time better...

      Got a ticket last night, tired of feeling like the only person who ever gets caught for anything. Make it work, driving, anything for that matter. I see all sorts of broken laws of all sorts every day and nobody does a damn thing about them. The law won't make the slum lord who owns my apartment do anything about it...why should I respect the portion about traffic laws? Why should I respect ANY other portion of any law if they all are not applied?  I got robbed six months ago- took the cops 45 minutes to get there, tell me I should never defend the things I own because somebody could get hurt (Hell yes...THEM...) and then do their best to leave before taking a report. Detectives never followed up or did a damn thing, no one ever does anything when I am the victum. I suppoise next time I am wronged I will simply take it all out on the person doing so....it works for everyone else it seems. Pity the fool that next tries to take advantage of me or steal from me.  Got some stuff done today so far- too cold to do most of what I wanted to do.

      Crap.  Got a ticket for speeding. I haven't had a ticket in almost 20 years. Couldn't get away from the yuppie in the SUV so I took the pace up. Of course, they never saw the SUV pass us after I got nailed....    I drove trucks and jeeps for almost 25 years. I know how they handle and how they don't handle. I am sick to death of being tailgated at 80 mph by idiots who never drove anything bigger than a VW before. Its not a tragedy when these soccer moms drive off a clif and kill the family beause they were on the cell phone and ignoring the road.     There should be both a special exam, and extra insurance costs for anyone who owns an SUV or a motorhome.

         OK, so the day has gone well so far. I reshot the Jeep where I made a major mistake in the painting process last week. Its too cold to do much this week, so I had to wait for the exact perfect time before hitting it hard. I think I corrected things well enough.    Laundry now stands defeated also, thats a lot of things so far- have to call about taxes later and complete that stuff.    I need to get an hour of writing in on testing and get out to the remore location for teaching. I hate the drive to the location. If the five in the beginners class do well, I will keep it rolling, if not...bye- bye...     Got the second broken Palm fixed last night, hopefully it will last a bit longer. Off to the next issue....now that I have a Palm back and can tell what it is!!!

      ..good thing too, I hate mornings, so I'm GLAD its BROKEN. Maybe it won't come on time tomorrow. Night is so much better than day- then again, if there was no day I suppose night would be ruined by all the lost daytime people wandering around during it and acting like they own it.    Got to get rolling on too much shite. taxes yet again, cars, writing, testing. It never ends...

      It's five months away until this years National Novemeber Novel Wrting Month contest. I have picked a satory name and idea, with the intention of turing it into a graphic novel afterwards.  I have been plunking away at las years story beefing it out to prepare for the publishing aspect of things. I wanted 130,000 words, but think it probably won't have enough beef in it for that. I DID resolve a major plot point so I can write towards a target now. I hate the way everything in the USA HAS to be written in one of three forms that people in this country expect to be spoonfed to them. I love stuff like Arundati Roy, and her "God of Small Things". It has all the elements of greatness, but would NEVER get past a college professor.    Speaking ofhich, I hve an adult friend who is getting six kinds of grief over her format of a major paper from some dumb fuck professor who never did anything in his life. I so HATE these kinds of goofass losers. Life is for those who DO things, not those who didn't do them. True, I became a fencing teacher,but I still compete when my kness let me!   I don't see professors taking over the world.    The TRUE reason its an aspect of war to kill all the scholars and students at first hint of war is so nobdoy has to listen to their uninformed WHINING all the time. Everything can be handled like a Monty Phython act.."This requires IMMEDIATE discussion!".   So the trick, as I see it, is to write some 6000 words a day between all the stroy lines I have, and there are plenty. Maybe be November I can have a clean slate to write with. SO..,I am living every day like its NaMo for a while! Rock On...Write on!

        That's the problem, in a proactive, PC 90's sort of fashion. I have no mission statement.    I used to have one, I wanted to change the world, save it from itself. Then I found out I was just as lost as it and didn't know how to save it.    So I gave up. Things got better. Sometimes, things get worse, when I forget that I gave up and start to worry about things.    For two years I have held to the credo "Whatever needs to happen, let it happen, let it be." I have no idea where the money for the next rent will come from, our how to pay the bills. It just happens. I may get fucked soon by taxes, but if so, I guess it needed to happen. I think too much about women, I can't turn that part off for some reason. That's why, I suppose, nothing ever happens there.    Maybe my mission statement is that I have no mission statement...?????    Oh well, need to go do something, but I don't know what yet.

        I seem to be getting back to something of a baseline. I got sick as hell in Ocotber and have no idea why yet. Whenever I get sick, I gain weight. This just didn't go away and it was a steady gain in weight. I tried to change my diet last month to very ill effects- bringing back the very stomach sickness that wiped me out in the first place.    I have been eating like crap and sleeping too much, not excercising at all...and finally feel like I am getting somewhat recovered. Now all I have to do is kick the weight back off, which sucks.    A person I had entrusted much friendship to blew me off in January, and it really hurt my feelings. She was female, and though we were not dating, for some reason it hit me really bad. I am so sick of being blown off by people, women in particular. It seems everyone is so self-absorbed they have no time for anything except their own little plans. It also seems like people in general have become much more selfish. Everyone says they have no time, but they all know exactly what is going on with a huge set of TV shows. Everyone wastes too much time in front of the TV. I wish I hadn't gotten a TV a few months back. I need to regulate its use better. I does put me to sleep well if I can't sleep it seems. I guess its got something of a use.    Today I head about 80 miles away to a special car club event to get my windsheild replaced. I have never had a windsheild replaced before, as much as I have wanted to do so. I am taking extra money to see what else I can have done to the car while there. If I get enough time, I hope to come do more paint/ touch up work on my 9-5 car of all these years. I have done a few things and she just gets better and better looking. Not so worn and frayed around the edges.     Car number two, the 9-5 car, needs struts and a front oil seal. I am trying to figure out how/ when to afford this. I have a job interveiw lined up after my parents come visit next month. Even one sale a week for this company would be a major influx of cash. I have avoided it because I wanted to sleep until 10 am every day. I need to get at least one novel finished and get this job. I need to move to Riverside and get away from this town. I moved here to fuck somebody who said they wanted to be with me. Now, all I think about is how bad I got screwed under by them. I don't want to live in this stuck up little town anymore. I also intend to change my website address this coming year to get away from the ref to the town. I plan to drop the program I teach here and be down with the place completly.    Oh well, 15 minutes until I need to be rolling down the freeway. Better Go.

        God, I don't know what my mind is doing sometimes. Yes, I had a Tramatic Brain Injury, but god this sucks.....    So I go to blast a clear coat on the last part of Jeep paint repairs..looked close at the rattle car high grade clear to make sure what it was and started to shoot. Bad move..I didn't roll it out into the sunlight...its clear..I can always polish out the bad parts as I go anyway. Except. I twasn't clear. It was high fill primer.   I KNOW I read the label that said clear- I guess its just part of the on-going brain malfunction I deal with.    So now I am stuck with my most recently painted areas coated with a nice think covering of primer I couldn't see in the dark garage. Actually, it seems like it may have surface filled things a bit, so in the end it might not be a problem. I'll let it dry, sand it down and blow the last of the color I have onto it. It should make things turn out really smooth...which is a plus.    Guess I need to get off my ass and order more paint. I would have been fine had I not tried to paint the entire jeep with a quart of paint. Oh wel, I'm getting pretty good. Think I'll sand the last of the factory decals off the hood and repaint it to match also.    N othing like the smell of paint to ruin my breathing. I still wonder where my belt went. I last wore it Tuesday, I have the PANTS I wore...how the hell does one lose a belt?!?!?!?!?

        I just can't get this Pig Slop thing to leave me alone. I don't know why. Perhaps there are some things we just don't need to know.     What a long week, now that I added a fifth day to my schedule of teaching, I can't stay home and watch Star Trek anymore on Wed. I am rather bummed. I also can't go to bed early and wake up feeling great on Thursdays. Oh well, something will work out.     I have been thinking two ways. I could get a job like I really mean it, or I could get a job in a bookstore or something for fun. I mean, my life is teaching fencing and plnking away keys towards the novels anyway. Why not take on jobs I always wanted to do for fun?    Oh great, most of the USA is terrified from one paycheck to the next..and here I am joking about work. Life has been so much better since I gave up hope. No more major stress over dumb things.    So much to do this weekend, getting a brand spanking new windhsheild for Molly the Miata on Sunday at a special event. Why can't I find a girl like my car? Nice lines, fun to be with, silver...well...maybe not silver...  Oh Pig Slop, who knows?

        OK...I have no idea what the Pig Slop deal is. I just like the sound of it together. Its silly, and reminds me of a friend who was mostly silly.    I helped another friend move today, I no longer have a pick up truck, but it must be a genetic alteration that happens when you own one....whenever someone moves you get invited to help. I didn't mind, we only moved the heavy stuff, so it was OK by me.    I am what we in the professional world call "Tired". I haven't gotten a damn thing done today and should be in bed. My Palm took a crap and lost a bunch of data that I hadn't Hot Synced out of it. Oh well, tomorrow morning I guess I'll be trying to reconstruct my life.....  Wish I knew where my belt went...

        There was a really attractive, somewhat shy, but basic solid and nice young woman of 18 murdered here in town about 8 months ago. I bought hamburgers from her at the drive-in she worked at. She had problems, it showed on her face..but she was a teen..and who doesn't have problems then?     Still, when your two best friends take you out in an orange grove and put a bullet through the back of you head and then lie and say it was an accident...poor, poor dear lost child. My heart goes out to her.  The gun that killed her made its way to the killers through a former student of mine. I saw him at midnight with his friends in a Denny's a few towns over a month or so ago. He is going to a fancy college now.    Other friends of mine went to school with her and went to the last party she attended the night before she was murdered. They are more than a little freaked out still.     The last time a teen murdered another teen around here was 10 years ago, and he was the brother of one of my dearest friends. OJ had just happened, and ANYBODY that did ANYTHING got convicted as they tried to keep a lid on things. I have yet to meet the poor fellow convicted, but I can see second degree manslaughter...but not murder. He killed a known drug dealer working at the high school he was attending..while he was still underage...yet they tried him as an adult. Did anybody notice..HE KILLED A KNOWN DRUG DEALER SELLING DRUGS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL....?!?!?!?!!?    I have had far too much death in my life and wish it would go away and leave me alone.    Well..off to something else equally light hearted I suppose...  I have no use for druggies and drug dealers. Instant justice for the cost of a bullet is too good for them. Slow, painful death should be meted out to them. Instead, we jail the ones who stood up and said , "No!". From all I heard, they went out to trade guns for drugs and a scuffle happened..a gun went off..and a dumb fuck was dead. Yeah- that sounds premeditated to ME.

      All of a sudden photos of naked Iraqi prisnors have vanished from the news. Shallow female soldiers are not seen, and no one at all is talking about the actual events. The Bush admin has spun it as far as the eye can see. Rumsfeild has gone back to Iraq, and the so called resistance there should have KNOWN he was coming....yet they missed yet another chance to take him out. In a purely tactical sense this is sheer idiots in mass at work. If you see a trap you set, or someone else set....and the prey is climbing in...spring it!  I am so sick of war. I am so sick of the so called leadership of the USA. I might even vote this time, just to get Bush out of office. A bullet or a couple of rounds would be so much more fitting. Remember...live by the sword, die by the sword.....might as well modernize it. I just want to see PROOF when the draft comes back that Bush's daughters are signed up like good little americakans....

      Well, maybe I needed to change the name of the blog- so I did. I am supposed to be working on a novel, but ain't been able to get it rolling again. I am directly influenced by Beatnik. It gave me an idea of how to get things out of my head.  I was surfing blogs, and as ever, at this time of the evening, found a girl from those islands that my buddy just got back from. Her blog was just called Beatnik. It had lots of refs to The Flaming Lips. Then, The Flaming Lips came on TV in the background. They seem OK overall, but two of my best musical friends have gone INSANE over them.  They remind me of my best friend ever, Kevin, who died what seems like a million years ago.A good sense of humor, a good sense of melody.God I miss Kevin, he would be having so much fun now.  Now Oprah is on TV going on about living like 400 years ago for some TV show. Give it to me, I would THRIVE away from this century.....  Need to write.

        Class was a bust. They still show up...but they seem to hate working. Why does anyone pay for, and show up for a class they don't care about? There were five people total. What a waste of time I seem to have created.     Sat in a pub afterwards and listened to two guys lying to each other about how many women they had screwed. I wanted to do something..anything...to interrupt, but just didn't care enough. I used to care about everything, and for the last five or six months have cared about nothing.      I just don't feel well overall. Now the problem is this..is it mental or pyshical? I feel more like it is my body telling me things are almost done for me. I just hurt all over a lot of the time and have no energy. It has been suggested I get a real job...which I am beginning to actually want. I have begun to think in terms of getting a job, killing my business, so I can write when I want to at night.    I should be writing now, but I feel rather unsettled like I ate something bad. This feeling has plauged me for months it seems. It can't just be in my head.    Got to get going on writing more than anything.

      Drove to Palm Springs for the 9-5 today. The traffic was terrible. Where the hell is everyone going...and why the hell are they wandering all over the road with no regard to anyone else?   Did my three stops and was exhausted by the time I got home. Now I have to go teach at the soul draining location where nobdoy really wants to get off their ass and work. I so wish I could get like 15 more people in Riverside steady..so I could kill the Redlands location...

        Went to the Chino Air Show. I have been going to air shows since I was 4, and I have never seen such a huge collection of vintage restored aircarft in my life. I like thme better restored than hacked up to be racers..by far.    Most of the show was fly-bys of incredibly rare aircraft. No stunting in them to speak of, jusy get 'em flying and let everybody look at them. They tossed thr Flying Wing out into the skies for a while also. What a spiffy aircraft.    Air shows seem to have this "Us against the World" and "We win because we are bigger" attitude about them. I saw Pappy Boyington's wingman, he looked like anice fella...not out to take the world, just doing his job. I also met Richard Bong's sister. She was a normal sweetheart of a lady...hard to tell her age. Looked like her brother was a nice fella too...what a shame to lose him so young. The P-38 Association was there in FORCE..and there were actually THREE P-38's THERE...including one that got flown a bit!    In addition, there was a group of WWII Japanese Vet Pilots as a group. I was amazed. I am sure many of therm were finally getting to see close up the aircraft they had battled against. Evrytime ANY aircraft went by their eyes were riveted to it. They were still pilots in their heads I am sure. Some had their families with them. I wanted to talk to them, but had no idea what to say...    There was a young Japanese fellow in FULL WWII flight gear posing on a Zero for the group..it was COOL..he looked really good and dashing....

         Still don't know where the term "Pig Slop" came drifting in from- but it's stuck in my head. Sort of like the theme music from "If You Had Wings" at D World......      Did a demo in front of a room full of 7-8th graders yesterday, have another one today. I somehow expended a great deal of energy at it and very nearly tweaked my knees in the course of it. I was exhausted last night and woke up so very late, with less than an hour to get to Palm Springs...which..of course, after 4 hours of waiting...made me not one single cent.     Got another demo in a few hours, tried to nap to feel more alive. I hope I kick into gear. Intro class tonight, and I am keeping my eyes open for missing students in my group. It's that weird , looking for an excuse to quit time again....

        I've got to admit I love the internet. I have three cars right now, a 1994 Ford Escort LX I bought new...now has 245,000 miles on it. A 1977 Jeep CJ-5 with 170,000 miles on it and almost fully restored and looking really sweet...and my new baby, a 1999 Miata with 150,000 miles on it.    The Escort has many new parts, needs many more- and on the way home I got the idea to do all sorts of stuff to it. Then I hit the internet. I have figured out that I have an actual sports car, and the money it would cost to barely improve the performance of the Escort could BUY a same year Miata...which is a different body style than mine. HHHmmmm...econo car acting like its quick..or a purpose designed car that already kicks the crap out of it?    Problem is, I do need something to haul things around in on occasion, and another sports car is too small for that. Perhaps selling the Jeep and the Escort could net me a half decent BMW M3 or something.     I get far too attached to cars, but its really getting close to a time to change. I need a place to live that I don't rent either...really, really soon. In the end, I am guessing I will seel the Jeep, get a place to live by using the money as a down payment, and keep the Escort to be my "truck" and haul things in.  Only time will tell....

      Well..today the news comes that Pvt. England had photos taken having group sex with the captives. Rumsfeild is in Ira repeating the "It's only a few people who did this...all on their own" lie.  Back to observation number one...the woman simply isn't bright enough to come up with things like this. Besides, if a woman wants group sex..all she has to do is find a bunch of soldiers and they'll do anything she wants....and she had a bunch of them around her all the time....   God only knows what we'll be asked to believe next...

      Salman Pax is having his blog turned into a movie. It got kinda boring when he vanished off to London for a long time...and never really had a bite to it afterwards.  Riverbend is always amazing. Such an intelligent person and still, everyday, in fear for her life and her family and friends. If I prayed I would pray for her. I will burn a candle and think of her and her people, it's more fitting. God I hope she makes it through......with as little pain as possible.   In the 1970's a woman named Patti Smith changed everything about my thought process. In 2003 a woman I know only as "Riverbend" has had as profound an effect.   Communication is everything, the internet is the next generation to carry the truth. Pray for the end of Baghdad Burning and the start of its healing.  Why don't they make a movie of Riverbend's blog? Maybe the truth doesn't play too well. I would love to know a fat Hollywood deal landed on her, allowing her to get her family to safety.

         Don't know why that came to the forefront of my mind- maybe because they are going on and on about "American Idol" on TV right now. I have seen it twice. The fellow everyone hates isn't bad at all. He NAILS it with a solid TRUTH to each comment, which are seen as insults.     The biggest problem I have is that NONE of these people are really talented. they are not artists in the least, they are simply entertainers- able to play back other peoples work and stay in tune. I don't prefer this sort of stuff. I want to hear people signing what they FEEL. Hence why Micheal Jackson is such an utter waste of time. He NEVER writes anything. Prince, on the other hand...well..if you can't see the contrasts, it's probably a result of your local high school cutting out art programs to fund yet another losing football or baseball team in your town.    As for football teams, they teach that only brutes who follow orders ever get ahead. When brutes follow orders we get things like Iraq.....10-1 all the soldiers who commit such nasty crimes could name their favorite teams in less than a heartbeat and tell you everything about them.    Why don't we ever hear about ones like the woman...that Hopi woman...who was killed doing her job? I think I heard she was the first Native American Woman killed for the US Military in the line of duty. Poor thing, what a waste.    All the brain waves seem to be going back to the Iraq Diaster. I find it so funny that GWB's people are saying its a low blow to bring up something as unimportant as  HIS RECORD IN OFFICE AND HOW HE HANDLES ISSUES LIKE THIS STUPID WAR THAT HE STARTED!!!!!!! Death to them all and their families. I hope to hell when the draft comes back the Bush girls (ALLL of them...Jeb's too...) get drafted and dumped into the unit that was tormenting people in Iraq.    In fact, I DEMAND to see their sign up papers (black out the personal stuff..) on line and in public veiw. Best not be in the Texas Air National Guard either!!! I wonder how long until they would all come back home preggars anyway...if they are as bright as their parents.     No more pathetic crap...anger baby, anger...spew it out...piss on those whow would piss on you before they get the chance...

        Just saw the woman from all the early Iraqi abuse photos on TV. Not to be mean, be she's not the brightest candle in the room. She's also awfully young. By her accent I would say she is from some back water of a town with no chance in life at all....and the army was her only chance at something more....than just a boring existance. So, in that respect, she's not  completly  stupid.    As we ALL suspect, she is saying that officers told them what to do. Here's another reason I suspect she is telling the truth: I don't think she is bright enough to come up with the types of things that were going on in the pictures. Sure, she could stand by and follow orders as they went on....but she doesn't strike me as someone who would have the slightest clue about what would really bother someone of profound (or een average)Islamic faith....!    Clinton had a young woman that the republican party expressed outrage over him fucking. I couldn't care less. (Hell, the majority of the leaders in the world ALL have other women they are fucking, it comes with the power. It's one of the things Clinton did that made other leaders figure he WAS in control.) I would rather know the president was fucking someone than ordering them to abuse people who had no control of their situation.

      ....That the Iraqi prison nightmare is "just a few out of control individuals"...?    Christ, the US Government can't figure out this is going on, and humble little me has been hearing almost exactly the same details as this from blogs for MONTHS! There are hundreds, maybe more, stories of someone's cousin, brother, father being taken away for torment. The stories say the women are being raped- and I have NO doubt they are telling the truth.    Mostly, I suppose I feel sorry for my own parents. They lived through WWII, when the US seemed to have dignity. Dad was in the Korean Conflict, and they saw the world go mad in Vietnam. Now it has gone to the point where its obviuos we are just as big bastards as everyone else- with photos to prove it. A few weeks ago I argued with my father that exactly this kind of thing was going on. I don't think he denied it, he just didn't want to believe it.    My earliest politcal memory? I was young, probably 7 years old. The family did the only vacation I remember, going to Ft Lauderdale to some army buddy of my dad's. I got pawned off on the poor teenage boy of the family. He wanted to go chase girls I am sure. He had the Democratic National Convention on TV and was watching it with rapt attention. That was fine by me, I found it interesting too. He was stuck with me, so he taught me how to play chess and I did OK. I think I surprised him, but it made the next few days go a lot easier.    On the TV was a row of vets in wheelchairs and then they were getting called all sorts of names and even being attacked. They had already given to their country, and in my young mind- of ALL the folks in the country, felt THEIR word should carry a little more weight than others. I remember going into the front room and asking why the dasabled vets were getting beat up by the police officers. I was told they didn't love their country and were traitors by the man whose house we were staying at. I asked how that could be with so many missing arms and legs they gave in the war.    The teen boy seemed to sense a storm and just sort of left. The man couldn't really yell at me because I wasn't his son, but every adult there was angry at me. It was like the Calvin and Hobbs comic I saw years later...Calvin walks up to his dad and asks "How do soldiers killing each other solve the world's problems?" The dad is just dumbfounded. I wish I had an answer for that one still. I cut it out (long before PC's and scanning) and enlarged it on a copier, and still have a copy of it.    We all know the truth, they put bottom of the barrel troops in the prison and forced them to do the evil things they did. No direct orders mind you...just that terrible implication that bad kids use to get shy kids to break the rules, "Wouldn't it be cool if those guys were naked and scared their balls were gonna be ripped off by a dog....?" Trying to get ahead, get a promotion, get more money, be cool, be a soldier or whatever the mindfuck against them was, they did all these evil things.    I sent far too many years with my hair half way down my back, getting harrassed for NO reason to NOT feel sorry for these men. mayhaps some of them knew something? For sure they are ALL part of the armed resistance as soon as they get out. If it were done to people in the US by outsiders, you can damn sure bet that amricans would be taking up arms against the oppressors...why is everyone so surprised the Iraqis are bent?    The truth is this: The President is in charge, he is responsible at every level for every public employee, including the military. In the end, it's HIS fault for allowing this to happen. My his family go through what he has allowed others to go through......and remember what has been happening to the women....    If I believed in god I'd beg him to save us all- but we see what that hath wrought already......

        Woke up at 5:30 am for no reason. Well, maybe because the traffic on the freeway is so bad anymore no living human can sleep once the stupid rush to LA starts every morning.      What kind of moron lives 90 miles from LA and commutes there every day to work? No matter how much money you make, the IE is a dump and not worth it. Families? WHEN do they actually see them if they leave at 5:30 am and get home at 9:30 pm? These people all have SUV's that drink gas like no tomorrow and are working themselves to death for the almighty dollar to pay for it. What was that Harry Chapin song? Cat's in the Cradle...maybe they need to listen to the words to that one.    Today the secretery for the owner of the apartments comes to "inspect" my place, since I refused to pay the rent increase until they effect all the repairs they need to. I fully expect to be thrown out instead of getting things taken care of. If so, I will milk this for every moment of free rent I can through my lawyers. I happen to understand I can get 90 days from protesting this set of issues, and another 90 to actuallu get evicted. Most people just don't know how to legaly respond in such a way that they can take advantage of it.    It's time to buy something to live in, and I can't stomach house costs. It goes against my nature and beleifs to spend some $250,000.00 for a simple house. I am going for a mobile home instead. Maybe a small house at some later date, but I practice "K.I.S.S." on issues like this. That's why I am not in debt to the tune of the average $500,000.00 like most americans. I suppose my debt is around 400 dollars all told....    Time to go iron clothing and put it away before the loser doing the inspection gets here....

        Very cool, Blogger has changed a lot. I set up a new template which lost all my links but I don't care. They weren't doing anything for me anyway.     The world is a mess, I will probably be getting thrown out of my apartment for refusing to pay the latest rent increase...I mean, I've lived here since 1996 and they still have fixed only two thing the whole time...it was 350 bucks when I moved in, and the current owner expects 725 a month...Nope, ain't gonna pay until it's all fixed up...      Probably time to move anyway, so I am checking on mobile homes tomorrow after the appointment in the morning. Work is a pain, the company keeps losing students, I have no idea why- mainly that Southern Californians NEVER commit to anything, so why should I expect students to commit....?    Need to get more Jeep paint- hope I remember tomorrow- I do have it listed on the Palm. I am so modern now.

I mean, yes, they are old...but would you want to know any of your sisters were dating them or married to them? Think about the evil spawn they would create....

Gotta get the demos put together and get the lists of people made up. What a chore. I needed a database a year ago, thought one was being made and never got it. I have a stack of paperwork a foot high to try and make sense out of. Bummer.   High speed run on twisty roads tomorrow. Just found out it's a picnic at the end.,....damn it...oh well...I'll figure something out I guess...

      .  My 9-5 job is insurance. Last Friday I went to my main account to present to a host of new employees they hired. I was there all day, repeated myself countless times. My partner and I signed up a fair amount of people. I just checked my bank account , and it yeilded me a total of only $70.00. Adding together the time it took...8 hours...the drive it took 140 miles round trip...the drive time about 2 hours...and the fact it almost made me late to my teaching gig...and I believe the job is a waste of time. In addition, I just hate doing it now. There have been complex and wasteful politics the whole time I have been involved, with only my direct manager doing any damn thing at all to ever support me or help me learn.    Looks like it may be cool enough, no wind and no lawn care going on here today. I might get the next step of paitning done on the Jeep project. Its been two weeks since I was able to touch it with all the trouble around here.     Noticed the girl of my hopes hasn't callled. I don't think she will...but then why does she seem interested and even give me her number? I don't understand. Is it the pace of life? I mean, a lot of people seem to like me in person, but then never return my calls to get together and do things. I'm not overbearing, don't quit get it. Maybe I need to transform into the slut chasing TJ visiting madman I was a few years ago. Funny, in TJ one can pick up and bang a US woman that wouldn't even look at them in the US. I mean, I nailed a string of college age girls who wouldn't give me the time of day here. I wanted someone to hang out with, get to know...and they just got naked ASAP. I'm not complaining, if some female young enough to be my daughter wants to get wild, lets go...but why do they only do that down there? I mean, I found interest from a wide range of the local woman, and even the whores had more dignity to them than the girls from college. What's the deal with that?   Next year I am going to the Phillipines with my friend for sure. If I have no woman, I will be looking for one there. His inviatation means I'll follow through. I wanted to check it out alone, but what the hell. I need a skinny girl. Simple enough...I really wanted one with a good mind but have come to wonder if its worth the trouble. Then again, I think maybe its american women in general that are the problem. They have no idea what they want. They want to crush every inch of a man's personaility and individuality out of him...and then expect him to be special and exciting. Then they leave with the first man that is exactly what they say they don't want in the one they are with. Worse yet, who do they come crawling back to when they get shit on by the losers? They guy they left....at least I am good about never going back into a realtionship with someone who screwed me under. If I'm going to be that pathetic I might as well end it all.   Guess it always comes back to girls. Mostly, its nothing to do with sex, I just want someone to travel with and to share life with. Someone who is smart enough to notice the interesting things and enjoy them.  Oh well, probably best to go breathe toxic paint fumes now.....

      .  Well..the Winchester location is doing its best to recycle. Damn near everybody has quit excpet for the newbies. All have some dramatic stroy to justify themselves...none had goals or a method to reaching them, so I am not surprised.   Was chatting a friend a bit ago, and his girlfriend blew him off. She blew me off as a friend some time ago, quite the little drama queen. I hope she grows up because I like her overall. If not, she's gonna end up bad, bad, bad....   Asked out the most attractive woman I know. She hasn't answered yet. Last two times I asked, she never called back. BOTH times she totaled her car. Come on, if you don't wanna go out you don't have to KILL yourself over it.....just say what every other girl I found attractive says , " I would, but my grilfriend wouldn't like that...."   Wonder what is posed to destroy itself next? I just sit and smile at the world, its going to keep on going around no matter what happens.....  Turn hard and fast very often...or drive off the mountain....Miatas Rule.

      .     Because RenFaire is in full swing. I visited Saturday, as I am not working this year. The booth I worked ta is majorly short of workers, but before the run started it was like all favorites to get a pass form the owner, as he kept saying he had too many people. I didn't feel near as bad when I heard that, so decided to stay out of the heat and not work it. I am glad I didn't work, it's been HELL out there. My friends there have finally seen all the bad things I kept talking about, but at least were able to stay clear of them because of my heads up.    I was supposed to go to my friend's babie's B Day party today but got really sick waiting for it to start. I rushed home and threw up a number of times and then passed uncomfortably out. I do believe I am allergic to pine nuts..and badly so. Last week when I felt so bad I had eaten pine nuts, same this week.    I had woken up feeling great and got a lot done around my palce..so it was weird to have gotten so very sick...seeing how I had no contact with anyone other human until the party...and I don't think the same thing as last week would kick in some unexpected exactly a week later.    So..I am exhausted and only got two more short stories entered into my system. I have 20 years of writing to do the data entry for, might as well get things in saleable order finally. I long for the day when it's all burned to a disc (or 5 or 6...) so it is safely saved. I'll take the disc down to be run on a high speed printer somewhere to get draft copies to work on.  It was just far too hot today- I dread tomorrow and have new classes to teach....

      I have gotten much done the last couple of days. I am tired for it. Bills have been paid, e-mails sent, phone calls made...it seems endless.  I don't know if/ when I can jump ahead to building a house, so I might have to take a step of a crappy mobile home in between the two. At least I would have a place to live.   People I know aren't answering my phone calls, so now I am worried what the hell is going on again. The summer drop out for class hurts my income a great deal. I hope summer ends soon...

      I started a blog to record my efforts to buld my own house. This blog will remian my frustrated place to blow off steam, and that will become a record of acheivement on that one subject. I am so tired all the time. I need forward motion.  I will get it soon, I'm going to be thrown out of the apartment I have lived in for 8 years so they can build a football field for the high school next door. It sucks that the effort is being lead by the father of one of the people I care most about on the planet. I really didn't need the stress. Maybe I can play it for all it's worth and get some conections out of it and use them to get my goal of a house.

      There is a little area in the local mountains..right near the bottom, not too far from everything else to be cool. On the way out everyoine kept pulling over and letting me pass. It was cool, and it was weird. I wasn't pshing anyone at all..I was taking in the sites.  I need to move, maybe that will give me peace of mind. I went to bed early last night and slept deep enough to have nightmares. I dreamed of Kevin, Steve and Tina...and the fact that they died some 16 years ago now and I am probably the only one who even remembers they were alive outside their immediate family. I dreamed so much I woke up in tears. I am majorly depressed and know it. I put on a work face for teaching..but it gets down to lonely mostly. I am more than rather tired of seeing asshole men abusing women..and the women being too stupid/ shy/ dependant / whatever to take care of themselves.  When did this country go bad? I think in the last 3 years it paked out. All sorts of women have children without even trying to be married. That's so damn selfish...having a child because you want one and to hell with having a family around it. I have a friend who is dating a woman with THREE kids who still lives with her parents. What the fuck is the deal with that? She is sexy, smart-witted..and expects someone/ anyone else to pick up the bill for all of what SHE wants. The problem is, this is the only kind of woman I ever see anymore. They want "equal rights", but don't want to give up being put on a pedestal and worshipped. It's all so very selfish.  I have always hated being alive at this age in this time. I wish it was sooner or later for me always. I am always out of time. Time, of which I am a year older today also. Why me?

      I am exhausted and nearly sick from the weekend. I overdid things so badly that my legs are cramping and my knees won't support weight for any length of time.  The launch was simply amazingly cool. It was nice to be surrounded by intelligent people of all sorts, from many countries. Spaceship One made its goal and the flight itself was impressive. The staging left a lot to be desired. I wish I could have set it up. I guess they don't quite understand how playing to the crowd and including them could be very good for them long term.  I can't even explain the details now. My parents are gone, this is over, and I have nearly a month of catching up to do on life. Even though I have already begun to search for a better place to live...I have found a front page write up that this land is to become a football field for the school. It's official now so I better get moving.  I want to build my own house. Not have a contractor do it. I hate when someone says "I built my own house, I had so much trouble with this contractor and that contractor..." I want to BUILD my own house. It looks like money is the biggest issue, I need to start getting things in line for it all. I'll go from there afterwards.  The focused idea is an alternative house of some kind. Maybe log, straw bale, slipform or something else like rammed earth. I don't want a "normal" house. I might have to live in a tiny trailer fr some time, but if I make progress it will all be fine by me.  One of my friends ran over something in the road last night and unched a hole in his oil pan. Bummer city. Oh well, everyone needs to work on their cars I guess. I have to get sanding and clear coating like a madman. All my cars have to be smogged in the next two months. Great...I needed that.  Oh well, got to get to Santa Ana and have my windsheild replaced. The new one has a delaminating problem. Got to describe the Space Flight better when I can.

        Well, it's now 7.5 hours until launch tyime in Mohave and I am so fucking wired I can't sleep. I need sleep. I need it before the drive. I'm going to meet up with a friend, maybe he'll car pool us there..it is rather pointless to take 3 cars for 4 people and all. At 10 bucks a car one of us could buy breakfast for two....get the picture?     It was Midsummer today- and the first day of summer began a few hours ago. I celebrated like I haven't in like 25 years..I went ...SHOOTING...?!?!?!? It was fun, and after all these years I was hitting targets at 100 yards with a .22 and no scope. I was DAMNED happy. I was worried a sometimes useful skill was gone. If I were young I could at least handle it if I were drafted. It was a bummer being out there with a group of kids young enough to be the children I never had. I was sad inside wishing that somewhere a child of mine was running around discovering life.     So in my mind I feel EXACTLY like I did before the first Shuttle Launch. It got delayed from a Friday to a Sunday and I was able to go along. A friend had a special pass being that his mum worked at Rockwell. The company I worked for had components on the Shuttle, but we were not big enough to get passes. I didn;t sleep all weekend, and afterwards died. A eek later as the engineers I worked under huddled together in the lunhroom to watch the landing, I became much respected when word got out I had been at the Launch. I miss that world. Maybe I should have tired harder...? But I was going to go into Music.....**sigh**....    So here I am a quater of a century later, shooting guns, fixing the neighbor kids model rocket launcher, going to High Power Rocketry events and playing guitar. Writing books sometimes too. 25 years ago I wasn't working a real job either. I was cutting down cypress trees that were sick in the swamps. Then record stores. Then more record stores..and then a very long time in warehouses at all levels....NOW a Fencing Coach. A COACH...?!?!?!? For an anti- athlete this is STILL too weird. My younger ones go off to impress at colleges, and there seems to be a batch going to the AF Acadamy now. What's THAT all about?    Next I have decided I need to build a house by myself. The biggest investment most people make is a house. If I build it myself I can save a great deal. I am thinking up a ways in the mountains. Not too far, but far enough to have toys (Read that Cars and Trucks) laying around where no one cares. I guess the american dream is to live away from other americans.     Half an hour until the alarm goes off for me to get up now. I can't hear fuck all, as the shooting did a number on me. I feel like Pete Townshend after a tour. Oh well, I hope it passes. Christ I wanna gun, I want rockets, I want guitars, I want cars, I want a house, I want a sexy younger woman ...maybe desire returning is a good sign.    It gets down to this. A young woman, whom I was not involved with, but trusted a great deal, blew me off and vanished. I valued her enough to NOT try and get in her pants or treat her like prey. It hurt my feelings more than I can say, and turned me off to many things. I am hoping the feeling passes soon. Its been about 6 months. If ever I run into her again, I do want a whole bunch of cool things to have happened in my life, so she understands the world doesn't orbit her, and the rest of us keep on living....through the pain of it all.    OK, Guess I'll go shave and hit the road a little early.....    Space, The Final Frontier. In hours the whole world I dreamed of as a child BEGINS!!!!!!

      Today will be too long. I go shooting in the afternoon for the first time in years. I go to a Midsummer's Party later. Then I have to try and get a few hours sleep. At midnight I leave for Mohave Airport for tomorrow mornings Spaceship One launch.  Tomorrow at this time I will have witnessed the first private launch into Space of an astronaut. I saw so many NASA launches, I may well have seen more launches than anyone at the site. I must be there at any expense.

      So I realized it was 20 years ago that Live Aid happened. Where has the time gone? Where has my life gone?  A major portion counted in years vanished into a veil of haze caused by a car wreck.   20 years ago. All my dear friends were alive. Kevin, Steve, Tina. I have tried over and over to let you rest in peace, but I miss you everyday as it you died only yesterday. 20 years ago was the biggest event in history, when lowly musicians did what governments refused to do. They tried to help others.  I was stuck in SF showing someone Fisherman's Wharf when I was DYING to sit and watch what was going on. Nobody would tape it for me. I wanted to see every damn minute of it. I regret it to this day.  I saw snips of things. Of course, I saw Queen....it was destined to be that a group that changed my life was the only one I saw the whole part of I guess. I think I was hiding in a little shop behind a door looking at a 8" TV screen someone brought to work whil they were caling my name to come to them.  There are photos of my that day, young, in fringe and ready to change my world. I s wish I had lived the life I wanted to live. In the wings were Marillion, waiting if others couldn't play. Cat Stevens with his new name was refused entry on the tage but still left the million pound check the Islamic community gathered for the event.  Tonight I can't stop crying. I think of all the gay people I knew in Florida. I think of how every time I wrote or called anyone I got a list of who had died. I lost touch with everyone that mattered. Then my three best friends in life died within a year of each other. I want to know why the fuck I had to live on?!??!?!?!?  It has been at least 17 years since I had THEM to talk to. To help me sort things out when I needed to. To help me keep my sanity.  Noticing Live Aid has broken my heart in some unexplainable way.  I am mired in the middle of a novel I am writing that I have spent 20 or more years thinking about. Now I don't give a rat's ass if I ever finish it. I just think I could sell it now.  How long ago was it that I saw the SAS band and sat next to Fish as he drank and talked...? The one night of my life I didn't say much of anything...because I was having a flood of memories the whole time...about what had mattered to me more than anything. About how I believed. Its been so hard being alive since that night.  Just when I get an idea I get sick, or chronic pain nails me to the ground again, or memory won;t work right again. I'd pull the trigger and end it tonight but I am just too vacant to figure out why. I think I'll wait until my parents are gone to do that anyway. Why hurt them that bad? It won't be long for that either..and then I will truely be compltletly and utterly alone on this planet.  Tonight, if I could give my life, and back to earth would come my friends instead of me..I would. They were doing something more with their lives than taking up space and resources.  All I wanted to do was play guitar and have a family. Was that too much to ask?  I don't dream anymore. I haven't dreamed since the wreck. My mind feels dead.  Old music doesn't bring hope and strength to change the world, it brings tears and suffocation.  What was I supposed to ask for out of life?

      My parents are gone, this part of the trip is over. I realize I have been increasingly stressed for about 8 months knowing they were coming. I just wanted everything to go OK for them while here. But I dreaded all the "Well so and so's GRANDCHILDREN..." talks. They seem to understand that it costs too much to do anything in life now a days. I have never made more than what my father made in 1973, and THEIR house payment was 185 bucks a month..while my RENT is 725....They are starting to understand the modern world.  It feels like something of a weight has been lifted, but I am so worn out that I slept in today. I need to finish the Jeep project and get rid of stuff I own. I have too many "Things". A lack of "Things" gives one freedom. You don't need a big place to live, or all sorts of other things that go with it. Actually, besides 3 cars, I own less things now than probably ever before. I think maybe in 1984 I had about the same amount of ownership.  Speaking to a friend last night outside on the curb. A woman came out of her place to see if we were OK. Offered us wine..like an idiot I declined! Damn- I thought later she probably wanted someone to talk to! I was worried our talking had upset her so felt hurried to leave. I should have talked to HER. She was both young and attractive, and was listening to Enya in her living room. She had a dog...geez, am I blind, stupid or BOTH...?!?!!!?

      God..I stayed up all night fixing a hundred year old Cavalry Sword. The guard had been crushed pretty bad in some time far, far past. You could tell by the way the crap was built up on the surface of it. I found an interesting way to massage it back into shape- it's brass or bronze so it isn't exactly pliable. I got it 99% repaired and its about 5% away from where it should be. I managed to sand out a lot of surface detail issues and it looks like a dremel and a lot of polishing compound will make this poor soldier rise to most of it's former glory. I beleive I can replate the blade if I can figure out how it's attached, and it needs to have a new handle carved.It looks like cherrywood. I need to see if the jewlery place I know can braze two places on the guard..then I can detail it out the rest of the way. The scabbard isn't in very good shape- but its great t find a way to take the injuries and age off this old friend of mine.....  So I didn't get much done today then, went to get the city payment and as ever, it isn't ready. Thursday they say..bastards. I got a lot of data entry done for the business, which is hurting with the stupid vacation time that has hit us. I need to do more, but at least I have 95% o the paperwork is sorted and organized stacks now, a vast improvement on the last few months. I should go walk- as I can't do laundry, but need to get to sleep also. If I can get up at 6:00 am I can do laundry then- and then the day will be spent driving my parents through the mountains in my car and my friends...!  c ya...

      Carry my digital camera more. Take more Walks. Ignore getting a real job for 8 more weeks. Fuck the hell out of the GF who dumped me for another guy last year (and then she got dumped). Fuck the hell out of the woman I take walks with. Fuck the hell out of some young asian woman I have yet to meet. Tune up the cars. Finish things I started. Fuck the hell out of the neighbor's cat. Oh..I mean...shoot the nasty little bastard and hang its limp, mangled body from their front door. Throw rocks at a few police cars in the name of repressed people world-wide. Declare myself a planet and seek membership in some non-existant organization for planets. Fuck the hell out of some young chick who likes Anime. Pick up a stripper, discover she was abused as a child and fuck the hell out of her anyway. Steal a car I don't like and fuck it up badly. Wear Gloves. Mail Roadkill to the assholes that got me fired from my last job (now that they have been fired after having been caught as the ACTUAL department fuck ups.). Fuck the hell out of just one of those girls who walks by every afternoon. Fuck the hell out of someone too old for me, her daughter and then her grandaughter. Again. Fuck the hell out of that cute sheep. At least in Photoshop... Discover a purpose for living, and fuck the hell out of it. Fuck it all.

       The truth about Ronald's death is this:    He died nearly three years ago, and it was never announced to the world.Instead, he was taken to Disneyland Anaheim and placed in deep freeze storage next to Walt Disney (Better known as "The Waltsicle") in Cinderella's Castle. (The upper rooms are locked and no one can ever go in there...so why won't they open them to verify the rumors of Walt being there?)Ron passed away some time ago, and at Bush the Elder's guidance (as former head of the CIA) the body was placed there for later use. They knew even then they were headed towards war someday- and would need major distraction of the press at some point or another. When they did, they simple roll out Ron's body and proclaim his death. They effectively took the world's attention off the mistakes of Bush The Lessor for nearly two weeks.  For a number of years, a character actor has played the part for doctor visits, and all files have been altered, as his blood type isn't the same. He was paid well, and finally got to undergo reverse plastic surgery to return his looks to his own now that he is no longer needed.  The first hint of this was a bad joke nearly three years ago where they mentioned the Waltsicle and the Ron-Pop in the same sentence. No one has actually seen him since, other than Nancy, who obviously had many interests of her own to protect and therefore played along.  There is a chance that Ron's daughter who passed away was dosed with something to give her cancer, so she wouldn't interfere at the time. While she may have been misguided in her little girl like undying love for daddy and the way she proclaimed him to the world, it's a shame she was killed for it. Then again, maybe that's a bonus, when just one stuck up little rich Republican girl is shut up too I guess.  In the last few years since his interment at Disney, that organization has bought up major chunks of land with little resistance to their advances. They own nearly everything around the Magic Kingdom, except the few fields from the fellow who refuses to sell to them right next door. Everything has fallen into their grasp, and it's all now patrolled by the Anaheim Police, even though leaving out the actual public roads, it's all private Disney property. This is because they then have jurisdiction over everything and can use the police force to back them up.   The recent flair up of the rape trial of an underage girl and the son of a high ranking cop in Orange County is simply a smoke screen in that area that kept attention away from Disney's issues. Disney itself is not evil (Well, other than maybe the Country Bear Review) and has simply been doing its civic duty as requested by the US Government. Their payoff was the expansion they were supported in. Its been said that M. E. got wind of the whole Reagan thing and was going to have the body removed, but it couldn't be put in the public storage place in Riverside that Timothy Leary is at for security concerns. M.E. was trying to keep the nose of the Disney organization clean, but the power play to remove him is all at the hands of ranking key people in the world of Disney who are deeply tied to the Republican Party.  There are probably a bunch of other things I forgot that the guy said, but its a little weird to run into a scared biker who thought people were out to get him in a bar on the Ortega Highway, only to see he's driven off the edge of the mountain less than an hour later. Most people who own a Ducati know how to handle them. Most people who work security at Disney can't afford one either I guess. All in all, it certainly added up to make the other day Number One in the Weird file......

         It's hard to be positive after breaking your neck and having a major head injury that affects every aspect of your memory, your thoughts and your speech. It's hard covering it so well that no one would guess it. It's hard knowing who I WAS and the potential I had before the wreck, and knowing it will never happen now because of it.     People in danger get uncontrollably sexual. They must mate endlessly. When your head is injured it puts you into an endless cycle that can't be broken. It's a survival instinct is all, that tells the animal part to reproduce before dying. The closer you get to dying during youth, the stronger the urge.     A lack of control over the things you find important drives you the same way. It's pretty simple, like a drunk has to get that woolen feeling to relax enough to fnction, with sex you need that release and hormone dump to bring you down.    It truely sucks living in this uncontrolable mode for years on end.It sucks having so much sex you injury yourself and can't then function at other levels. I hate cronic pain induced by my broken neck, I hate the blur of my mine when the day is too noisy, or I am too tired, or I got too much sleep. I hate daytime, because the extra amount of images one can see overwhelmes my mind and forces me into a near coma of inactivity. I live for the night, where the sights and noise go away and I can focus on anything at all.     Only then do I get insights into conditions overall.      More women have been my sexual mates than the number of people in my graduating high school class...by far. If its not triple digits you are a rank amatuer at it. If you've never had five woman in 4 hours you haven't a clue. If you've never paid for it, or gotten paid for it you don't count.    I never bragged about it, in fact, never told anyone about it because I was so embarrassed. the other night I heard a college boy lying through his teeth that he had been with 30 women. It was everything I could do to not stop him cold and call him a liar. 100 to 1 he has been with maybe two girls and a whore that ripped him off big time. No more than that.     Even ants mate, otherwise there wouldn't be so many ants, so the big score card of sexual interaction is beyond me. I treasure more a conversation that means something than a fuck. I don't care anymore.    Screwing everything on two or more legs simply blows a certain kind of life force out of you without using it in a creative way. Its a sure sign that something in your life is not what yopu want. Maybe you make a lot of money, maybe you are very good looking, maybe you are entirely too talented in some fashion- but the overactive sex drive is a sure sign that a person is making up for a lack of control somewhere else. Mybe the rich one wants nothing more than an extremely simple life- but has demons of childhood to pass ( I HAVE to get farther than my drunken/ drugged/ stupid/ missing/ whatever parents did in life- and I'll prove myself by owning more than them). maybe they have regrest that they chose to do something they hate rather than want to do, so no matter how much money they have, they feel useless anyway. Maybe they haven't a dime and never wanted more than a small deal that was taken care of....but they drain the potential out of their balls or twat and will never amount to anything they care about.    The wreck made me that way for almost 15 years. Its rare nights like this I have gotten so tired I can see it and work it out in electrons enough to say it in a linear fashion. I'm not weird or sick, I WAS injured, I am not better or worse than anyone..I am just me. Whatever needs to happen, let it happen...let it be.

          OK..I have to say it. I am  fucking sick and tired  of "SUV's". (I drove a truck for like 20 years non-stop. Corvette engine I rebuilt, Good gearing and I did all the work myself. Replaced it with a 77 Jeep that is still out in the garage and I am painting myself. I know more about trucks/ 4 x 4's than 95% of the population..including most people at "Specialty Shops". I was doing it when they were in diapers.) SUV's not trucks mind you, but in this area they have become SUV's. Most of the time what makes something an SUV is one of two things:  1.  A dumbfuck guy around 30, shaved head, tats, goatee and peircings blazing along at 100 mph in something that shouldn't go over 80 and  tailgating me ...with no idea how to actual drive fast. (Probably listening to "Korn" or some other such crap rap/ rock outfit that was made by the record company).  2.  A soccer mom with two or three brats, lunch and a cell phone all taking more of her attention than driving...while  tailgating me . (Probably listening to J Lo or some such other crap that was made by the record compainies.)     Two weeks ago coming home late I was getting ridden by a Cadillac Escalade. (Like Caddy has a fucking clue how to build ANYTHING at all..?!?!?What a CRAP company. I like the old name "Jew Canoe" for them...). Take it up to 80, he's right on my ass, slow down to 45, he's blinding me with his highbeams. With all his "American Muscle" does he PASS me..NO..DUMBFUCK!!! Long straight road with no curves so I got nothing to play for handling wise. Kick it down to second from fifth and leave his pansy ass behind by the time I topped out of second gear. Pegged it at 135 for a ways and in the distance I see him getting his speed up. That's fine, dead end light ahead about a half a mile, I am looking forward to seeing him blow through it into the field across the way.     I can see the Caddy rolling over bumps like the pig it is, so I slow to make him think he's catching me. I WANT him on my ass when we get around the next two corners and go for the mountain pass.....I'll put him into a guard rail there for sure. ...(Nice trick for sports cars like mine. Letting them keep catching up in the mountains...tap the brakes to "slow down" for the corners...when you know somethingt nice is ahead, speed up to sucker them in, don't touch the brakes as you apex the corner and watch them fling their piles of shit either off the side of the mountain or into a waiting guardrail. ...yeah..I am getting good at it. The Ortega is a nice place to pull it for sure. If they can't drive and kill themselves..TFB.)     I let him catch almost back up when I hit a stoplight. I can see by the bodyaction he has just begun to understand he is doing 110 mph and won't be stopping at the light, so he blows the light without stopping at all..ends up in the wrong lane and off the road on that side of the road anyway....I had ducked around the corner and nailed it...I'm still in 3rd gear when the CHP sitting with his lights off (facing me in the other lane) turns on everything and fucking blinds me as on-coming traffic with his spot before spinning around behind me to pull me over. Just behind him, the Escalade slams brakes to try and not run over him.     So I get pulled over...and HE just drives right by! The cop never saw him at all and I get a fucking ticket for speeding! I asked what to do when it happens next time and the guy said "Just slow down and let him pass." OK brightboy..I tried that and he didn't want to...what next? No answer. (How the FUCK do you miss a pile of shit raised that high in the wrong lane..with high beams and an extra set of driving lights (Illegal in this state to have uncovered while on any public road) and fishtailing back and forth while you see the damn sports car that is less than a third the size of this bastard...?!?!?!?!)     So my lawyer is going to take it to court and get it thrown out. Screw them all. Since two weeks ago I have done Mr Speed Limit everywhere I go. So far since then, 7 cops have blazed past me while not on call..all majorly breaking the speed limit. What the fuck are the laws FOR?!?!?!? I have even been passed by a church bus, overloaded with kids..because there were a bunch STANDING in the aisles...while a cop was riding along just behind it.!!!Oh yeah....give the SPORTS CAR a ticker for SPEEDING..but an overloaded bus is FINE becuase it says "Jesus Loves You" on the side....?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!     One fun note..in the last three weeks, I have seen three reports on TV where stupid soccer moms were on the phone and wrecked their SUV's. The first one drove off a cliff on Mullholand (What kind of MORON speeds there AND tries to grab a phone? Hell, in a SPORTS CAR I won't even begin to think of the cell when I'm out there!!!!!!!) while talking on the phone...kiled herself and all her kids..DUMB BITCH! The next hit a pole and damn near kiled both her kids. Poor bastards will fight chronic pain for life..I really feel for the kids......of course..looking for the phone... and the last rolled her SUV and killed herself and everyone as it dove off the freeway.     Don't these idiots get it? They drove a damn honda or VW for so long and now they think something HUGE handles the same. NO...DUH!  Then the compaines make all these claims of how safe they are. Well..yes...compared to cars..they are safer in many ways..BUT...the ratio of acciedents in SUV's is going through the roof. I read that more people were killed in SUV rollovers last year than any other kind of traffic wreck. Good...kill more yuppies...!    Another good thing...SUV's are so hot, the bottom has fallen out of the rest of the used car market. I saw a 4 year old BMW M3 for like 6 grand...less than half of what its really worth. There are some DEALS to be made on great Off Shore sports cars and tourers. Fuck american cars..I have had so many and had so many break down. They bled me dry. Support the american worker in Detroit? Where the fuck was THEIR support when I got screwed under in MY industry? Fuck no...they just wanna build shit cars and have everybody buy one every three years. I hope they all have to work in 7-11 like the rest of us poor bastards had to do...! The little jap car takes 6 times the beating ANY of the muscle cars I had ever did and never misses a beat. Takes a corner like a pissed off whore chasing a trick that snuck off without paying. I have friends who put a blower on their cars at 200,000 miles and are at 410,000 miles now without a problem. Over 200 hp at the rear wheels in something that had 110 from the factory..and nothing else has worn out or broken. Christ, I couldn't even keep U-joints in the damn chevies when I built the engines...Drag races are for losers..if it ain't in a mountain at high speeds..it ain't a race...    I have found that holding the digital camera up and snapping a photo of how close they are seems to make 95% of them back right off. I have decided to go the next step, write the times and places down and report these assholes to the police. I mean, it shows exactly how close they are running to me..has their plate number and their face.     My dad used to bitch that teenagers in the 60's ruined it for him when they all started wearing jeans and he couldn't get a decent pair for a reasonable price for work anymore. I just got what he meant I suppose.

      Weller words pop into mind. He was the patron saint of saving Mod until he actually made progress and imploded. Now he is a grumpy looking fellow wimped out playing R & B...who used to have the nerve to call Pete Townshend a sellout! Christ, Ya gotta hand it to Pete to keep playing his own tunes, even if sometimes they have bad timing. If Pete sold out, Weller burned out, and that's worse because you don't know that flogging the dead horse ain't gonna make  it get up and move. Poor bastard. (Weller that is...).  So I give great advice to everyone, I have such insight. Maybe the fuck I should take my own advice sometime, it sure seems to work for my students and they love me for it. Got to fence an old friend tonight, he is a touch older than me, so we took breaks as we whined about our age. I really needed it. I did things wrong, but at least I did things.   Feel a little better, even though the visit from an alien land started weird as usual. God save me from somebody.  Feel more like getting something done for the first time in ages. Hope it sticks. Wish to fuck I had a woman to play with. Maybe after I finish this novel.

      I was up until 4:00 am again last night. I started getting into the kitchen stuff about 5:00 pm and never stopped. The dunpster was about half filled by me this morning, I have once again gotten rid of so much stuff I can't believe it. I don't buy a lot of things, so how is it I always seem to have so much to toss out?  Well, a lot of it is stuff from 15-20 years ago that is broken or no longer of any use I suppose.  I got jeep painting down today much to my surprise, before the terrible lawn workers who ignore my place got here. I got the garage area picked up and cleaned out a lot also. I am putting more and more into bins as I empty useless stuff out of the same bins. It's all towards moving at some point hopefully soon.  Parents get here in like 18 hours or something, and I am stressed. I never look forward to these trips at all. It's so weird, we only had one vacation in 17 years of my growing up, and maybe 4 trips to the beach total. Now the people who wouldn't travel have become travelers...and yeah, I feel left out.If I ever had kids they wouldn't know which one was our home....just so they get OUT there to see the world instead of just be born to work and die.  Yeah..like that will ever happen.

      Too much stress is coming down on me. I have an idea I can really make it big teaching at my own place, but am self-sabotaging. Got to get rolling.  I reassembled the kitchen I took apart months ago with grand ideas of making it nice. I painted the walls and lower cabinets and refinished the doors. It's pointless to do anything more for an owner who keeps raising the rent and fixes nothing himself. Its half done in my eyes, and HE can try and match the stain colors and paints I started with. I know for a fact he'll just have some under the table illegal alien blast the whole place with white paint froma spray gun when I'm gone anyway. What ever happeed to taking care of what you own?  I went looking for a new place to live. I have to admit I don't want a mobile home in a park at all. I don't like the looks of the so called neighbors. I really would rather move to the mountain and hid from everyone. I mean, no one ever comes by now anyway, might as well completly become a hermit and have seasons to see at least.   Got my hair cut and wasn't feeling well. The woman thanked me for calling with an invite out, I felt so awkward because I called like 6 times. At least she acknowledged me. I don't think she'ed go out with me anyway. She too is self-defeating. I don't think I looks so good with the weight that came back and all that. Oh well.  I shredded 20 years worth of useless stuff I had saved tonight. Including every single peice of paper the bitch who screwed me under ever gave me. I am working to get rid of every single thing she ever gave me also.She used to buy things all the time, it made me feel like I wasn't good enough for her, like I was a pet or something. I asked her to stop but she wanted to keep doing it. I finally figured out it was all about how she felt about everything, and she wanted to feel like she was doing some big favor to me by buying things instead of commiting to me as she indicated she had been willing to do.  Moving out of this town will be hard. I've never lived anywhere as long as I lived here. I dislike it for many reasons, but I am scared all the same. I don't have the option of up and just leaving the area like I wish I did. The internet has made functioning as a writer much easier than in the past. I could effectively live anywhere at this point it seems. Oh well, got to get done and published before I worry about that anymore.  I realized I have to do things one step at a time. Finish the jeep and sell it. Sell my collections, I don't need material things holding me down. My parents gave everything I left behind to the fucking church school, for the little spoiled rich kids to destroy. Some of the toys I had expected to bring out here someday for the sake of my childhood memories. Some of them are worth incredible amounts of money now also. I knew this too would happen. I didn't know it was so much of a bother for parents to hold on to one small closets worth of toys for an only child.  I don't know what I want at all again. I wanted a woman, but they all seem some vindictive and vampire-like now. I wanted a nice car, got one, and found I don't care anyway.I don't EVEN feel like touching any of my musicial instruments, after spending so much time learning them and writing music.I write because I can't help it. I seem to be on track to never have the family I wanted so bad, so my only legacy wll have to be self-made.  My students parents tell me I am amazing with kids, they all love me. That is cool. Still, I am quickly becoming Mr Chips- the only other book besides the Great Gatsby I wanted to avoid living. I seem to be weaving the two stroies together. At least Chips HAD the woman of his dreams for a time, and Gatsby had cash.....its like a sick joke that I don't have any of the strengths they had. Somebody just shoot me.  I must be severly depressed, and have no idea how to break the chain right now. This isn't teenage angst either, if I didn't feel so sick I would be worried..if that makes any sense at all.  June 6, 1979 was the last time I smoked pot or did any other thing that was bad for my body like that. I wonder if it was worth the gesture?

         I knew it would happen this way. Raygun finally dies and everyone is again giving him credit for things he didn't do. It was bad enough THEN, do we HAVE to hear it all again....?!?!?!?!? They also are rosy eyed not remembering all the damage he did to the world.     They remember him making the biggest tax cut ever..They don't remember it screwing things up royal and MAKING the biggest INCREASE to cover it the next year.    They complain about crappy products made overseas, but don't remember him busting the unions (Starting with the air traffic controllers) and ruining US Industry...Thus FORCING things overseas.    They remember a sad eyed speech when Challenger blew up..They don't remember his DIRECT order that it be launched against all operating procedures because of the tempature. They also don't remember his MURDER of NASA, when he took so much money from the program to refloat the god damned Battleship Missouri. They don't remember that the only way NASA got Shuttle in the air was to go to solid boosters instead of liquid ones....which is the SECOND way Raygun is directly responsible for murdering the crew.     They don't remember that the hostages had their release secured by tireless efforts of CARTER behind the scenes..who didn't showboat everything. Carter showed TRUE dignity by not saying anything about it at all. Raygun beat his chest and acted like somehow HE was responsible for it.    They don't remember it was a Republican Congress that killed the B2 program, and CARTER made sure all the parts of the program were moth-balled so it could be built later....so Ronnie could get credit.      They don't remember he froze Min Wage for eveyone and took away cost of living wage increases so that everyone at my young level could never get ahead.     They don't remember that health care went to crap because he backed big business getting into HMO's.    They don't remember he traded ILLEGAL DRUGS for MONEY to illegally arm people trying to overthrow a government..and then he LIED under oath about it!    They don't remember that terror first hit us because of him. They don't remember that the US was looked at as a place of compassion with Carter, and a nation of brutes telling everyone what to do under Raygun.    He destroyed all my dreams when he destroyed NASA. I was THERE. Everyone in my hometown had someone who worked there. I heard it right from the people at NASA, NOT from TV. All I had dreamed of doing since I was 5 was working for NASA, the days I tried to get a job at ANY contractor were met with anger as companies were laying HUNDREDS of people off. Bastard.    They don't remember the birth of the whole PC world with fucking christians telling everyone else what to do.     They don't remember this was the start of the holy war Bush carries on now.    They don't remember censored lyrics and bands dropped by labels instead of facing the white house.     They don't remember that he so angered Europe that they were able to unite into the EU and exculde anyone else from their nations who might not want to live in the US.    They don't know all those things about what his policies were doing world-wide that my friend Steve told me before he was murdered, probably by his governmental loonies. Steve, I miss you so and have to admit you were right.     These are the same people that put the Bush cult in office. These are the same people who don't see the currnet cult leaders faults. These are the same poeple who had to CREATE a probelm with Clinton the second he got into office (Whitewater) and yet REFUSE to hear anything bad about a moron who lead us into a war that wasn't needed and is driving us into even MORE debt and wants more money to build prisons in Iraq.    The USA will die early. It will die because there are too many resources here, and 90% of the people have never faced TRUE adversity and won't know what to do if it comes without warning.     They don't remember cuts to art funding to expand the military.    They don't remember the repressing horror that was the 1980's for anyone that wasn't a bible beating goody two shoes that wanted MORE out of their life.    They don't remember how the entire media was in his back pocket with cheery versions of everything he did to confuse the ones who never looked at more than the surface.    THEY...run this country now. God get me out......get me out....I need to leave this...place.

        So most of my friends are single, through no choice of their own. One will probably be single soon because the woman of the last three years just won't stand on her own two feet for damn near every day to day issue.    Women are out there. They say they want love and respect from men. Fromn what I can tell in the US, what they really want is a bank account they don't work for. At the same time, men have dropped into wanting a free whore.    I used to work with a really sexy woman in a record store. After about the first week, we got to talking prtty easy, and her pet peeve was what she called "Washing Machine Whores". They were the tennis club wives wearing the little dresses everywhere they went. They didn't give two fucks about their husbands or really their kids. They cared if they had the best car of all their girl friends, the best house, the best washing machine...and they would only fuck their husbands if they wanted something (like a washing machine) that had caught their eye.    In the meantime, they were gladly fucking the living shit out of the younger tennis pro at the club. Word spread like wildfire anytime a new one started, it was like a contest to see who could get laid first, who could give him a BJ first, who could get nailed anal first...whatever. The pros were quiting because they couldn't keep up with the wives. All known to be true becuase we both knew tennis pros in the area!    Anyway, this woman was engaged, and I finally asked her how much she loved her husband. We were alone in the store and she said she adored him, etc. But the longer the day went she sadly admitted how much she was realizing that she was looking for the security of money herself, and wasn't feeling love towards him.    I suggested that she was becoming her own pet peeve and should just become a syraight forward whore instead. She was taken aback a bit, until I added a unchline that at least it was all down to business when she wanted something, no lying to a mate about it. The conversation came and went until she asked , "But who would pay me for sex?" in all honesty. I answered back with, "I would in a heartbeat!" with a laugh. Her eyes widened and I tossed out , "I've got 50 bucks in my pocket, I'll give it to you to fuck me in the storeroom right now."      The door was locked in an instant and I fucked the shit out of her. I gave her the 50 bucks and she was amazed. I told her I had no problem with it, because as she had pointed out, most of the time men are paying for sex even if they didn't want to admit it. She asked if I had paid before and I said yes, and that 99% of guys had been whoring before even if they didn't admit it. I just told her I didn't find it to be a big deal.    The next days work I joked that I couldn't afford more than 20 a shift for a quicky with her if she was game. I fucked her every day we worked together for months. After she married I kept fucking her, and it got a lot hotter when I was "the other man". She brought her husband in at one point and he was a complete fucking dork. A moron with some sort of high paying job but no brain cells to actually hold a conversation with her. Thereafter I asked her to leave him everytime I was in her. She couldn't make up her mind, I moved out of the state. Maybe I should have tried harder?    So my male friends can't find a woman, yet proudly proclaim they won't pay for sex. YET, they will dump 300 dollars oon a stupid dinner hoping to "Get Some" afterwards. I just can't do that. I don't give a fuck if I get sex from a woman on a date or not. I would like a nice conversation and something in coomon with a woman. Sex is always nice, but if its a problem, there are plenty of real and imagined whores to get your glands on anyway.    I'm thinking my one friend really wants a steady woman but is making sure it won't happen. He never falls for anyone who doesn't have a BF, husband or something else. Then, in fits of stupidity can't talk to them, and does things like text message his undying love to them at 4 in the am on a worknight. Then he wonders why they never talk to him again.    I am tired of the whole chase right now for myself and haven't had the heart to care about anything. Maybe I should go on a grand Oscar Wilde 1890's whoring adeventure in TJ or something.Maybe I should get a certain 19 year old friend drunk and naked. People all just wanna get naked anyway, I don't know why all the headgames about age, commitment and all that. When you find the right one  it may happen. It's the damn churches that complicatd it all so much. I am supposing cave men/ women rather just fucked until a kid showed up, and that bonded them together.    Oh well, I need to not be bored today.

         Went to DMV to renew my DL this morning and drove the Miata. I have been driving the Escort everywhere, as its a tax write off as my business car. There was a parking spot along the road in front of DMV, but something told me to park out in the dirt field across the street.     Two hours later, after they took my money and a photo, I went back out to find a woman who had been taing her driver's test had run into like 5 cars...exactly where I would have been parked! I'd love to see the comments on her test sheet....;<>!    They were so busy that they didn't make me take the eye exam, which is good because my eyes are tired from the computer work I have been facing. I guess they saw glasses and figured I was current.    Been waking up with dreams about a young woman I know. We have mutual friends that would kill me if I slept with her. Still, she has the goofiest sense of humor and is a flake exactly the same way as I am. She has seemed rather intriugied at my dating other females her age...so who knows what will happen. If I get the chance...why say no?

      Well..there is a fellow in his 80's who comes to fence when his health allows him to. He picks up every mistake you make and nails you for it. I can beat him, but don't always want to. Its nice to get behind a few points and see if I can pull it out of the hat and do what is needed to win. He plays tactics perfect everytime...he is like a 20 year old who has 80 years of strip time. Probably going to be one of the best things about fencing I remember in my own twilight years. Last night, when we began to fence the entire room stopped to watch. He digs it, he is a ham and a showoff as much as me..I like it too. I almost rendered a knee..it seems solid today with a little pain...but not destroyed.  I spent a lot of time doing quicky private lessons one on one also. Bringing the bar up a notch at a time. The students are all great at this point- some may be sloppy, but all WANT to get better.  In the middle of the evening I was handed a complement that really sank in. One of my women student's ( A working professional with kids..and a damned intelligent woman one can tell in conversation) told me I'd be not only a good father, but an amazing one. She can't believe the way I teach and make everyone feel like they are doing increasingly better. Two other women jumped in to agree. What struck me is that I have been told this about being a father by women with kids who are professionals...in other words, intelligent women I would trust as having made a logical deduction. I laugfhed to myself that I wish the ones without kids could figure this out...! Maybe then I could find someone to hitch the bowline to and create a crew. Yeah, I was married at the wrong time, under all the wrong condidtions...so it wasn;t time in my life yet for it. NOW...I KNOW I am in the place to be the world's best husband and father. But..like everything else..it will happen when it happens!  What was it I read years ago? You have to treat a woman like your business partner at a fancy dinner, you're only daughter when she cries, her patron when she creates and your whore in the bedroom...or something like that. Having a range like that of things to do sounds good to me. I need an adventure.....  I saw a very interesting study about animal nature about a year ago. The researcher had used any number of animal types to test the thorey..and then added a none official part backing up the observations with what they saw in local pubs...:    They placed virgin female animals in cages with young, healthy males, and with older healthy males. They also placed non-virgin females in the same cage. Without fail, the virgins ALL went for the young, rippling males to mate with. The older, sexual active females ALL avoided them like a plauge and went onlky for the older males. The researcher noted that the younger males mated and left the females. Thy also were aggresive and usually hurt the females. It seems that the older males provided sex and no pain, and also interacted with the females after mating. These were the mated couples that went on to produce offspring. Most of the couples that stuck together with a younger male did not...but always had both parts of the couple in fights or roughed up and injured.  I came out of it thinking that maybe I should try and get a grant to study something extremly obvious also! I mean, last year- a young woman I knew (19) was attracting the attention of a number of men I knew. She ignored all of them, and persisted in going on-line to meet these...well...marines. You know the knid, big muscles in their arms and nothing in their heads. She, of course, wanted to be appreciated, taken to intelligent places and treated with respect. She just couldn't get it through her head these guys were keeping score cards of their mating prowess and didn't give a rats ass about a woman for more than something to fuck...once. I fear she will finally give herself to some idiot who is going to just fuck her heart up. Then again, I think that's what its going to take for her to gain some self-respect! Then, of course, all the guys that wanted her so bad last year will be spoken for (as I believe all of them are..). Why do I see yet another enlistment into the military coming with this one...? Oh well, I always advocate brusining ones own knees!  So..the GIG. How very funny. Don't get me wrong, I think this group of folks is very nice, and admire them for NOT being yet anopther Korn or Sublime copy band. ..BUT...they are very self-important. They think they know everything already. I do beleive this is there first gig. If not, it sure seemed like it.  I mean, when you have three fronts in the band and a drummer..it stands to reason that one shouldn't out TWO keyboards across the width of the stage so nobody can SEE the band! Then, in a very, very dark room with black lights..one doesn't DRESS the band in all dark clothing.....once again..BECAUSE NO ONE CAN SEE THE FUCKING BAND! Then, one doesn't turn their back to the crowd everytime they take a solo...because NO ONE CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON!!! Yep- these pups have never studied anything about actually being in a band. They are doing a great job impressing their close circle of friends..but it isn;t going to go any farther than this until they do it right.  My friend is their George Martin. He understands all aspects of the whole deal...and can't get them to do so. I am going to advocate that he begin to move past them as a group and build his own skills. My guess, if he does so, is that in five years the band itself will be working at their parents busniess's, and draming about the past, while my friend will be working his way through an amazing carrer with really interesting bands and music. Sort of a Todd Rundgren deal.  I invited someone I knew to show at the last minute- that god she didn;t make the drive! I mean...they play FOUR tunes and stayed on stage like 26 minutes at the MOST. It was SO funny that they finished the last song and immediatly began ripping down the equipment....I mean..I wasn't sure they were even done yet!  I mean..even PROG bands learn tunes from other bands..because if a fan likes what you do, one can bet they'ed like older things like "Muscial Box" by Genesis, or maybe the odd PFM track or something. It gives one room to stech out and play and better connect with the fans!  I am, now, rather dumbfounded as to WHY I never got anywhere in music. I have always seen these things. I suppose the choice to not go to the recording school I wanted in the 80's was a key moment. That...by the way..was cut short by the car wreck like so many other things. At 13 my best friend Kevin was playing better than any of the folks last night. He could, no lie..probably play every song by Genesis on the first 5 or 6 records by that point. Those are not easy songs to learn...its not a bunch of 3 minute pop like Van Halen or something...THAT'S the enviroment I STARTED in....yeah..I think maybe I need to get the Cubase SX program working and get to writing on it.  I have just begun to wonder if the keyboard I use, which has a rather weird sizing and spacing is the main reason for the onslaught of typos as of late...and the pain in my hands when I type too much.  Oh well, I need to do something/ anything now.. (Like the clever ref to Todd Rundgren?) Oh well..no one else caught it either...I can see for miles and miles...  smiles for miles

      So what's going on? I can't tell. I awoke so sick and shivering and full of visions I couldn't sleep again and now its light outside. I am promised to attend a musical show tonight of friends half my age- and long to do so.  See-saws balance right in the middle if built correctly. If you try and push up or down on the end of the board to force the issue, it throws the balance off compeltly and the entire deal tilts wildly to the OTHER direction. Children enjoy all this tilting back and forth and all I ever wanted to do was see if I could balance the damn things. Was that a shape of things to come?  I may be completly wrong, but I believe Cygnus X1 is the nearest Black Hole to us on this planet...in a week when the experts have changed their minds on everything important about Black Holes. Funny, the celstial SeeSaw is out of balance again.  Everything I seem to eat makes me sicker the last 24 hours- so I abide it now with a huge chunk of chocolate cake. If it was good enough for the Aztecs to kill for, its good enough for me to do the same. Chocolate is god.Dark bitter Chocolate is even closer to the Truth, the Cygnus balance of life itself.  I hve been trying and trying so very hard to "Let it Happen", which, from this mornings sick and twisted perspective seems to indicate I have tilted the SeeSaw yet again the other way from trying too hard.  There is so much to be said for all the Asian perspectives, something from an older people, that still have their ancient souls. I have one such friend whom I can't explain. I met her for massage when the pain was unlivable, we ended up in sex...which, in the end, seems to have been the most healing of all things I needed. There is something ancient about this woman, spite not her 2 children or modern life. She seems to genuinely enjoy my comapny as I hers. She is so very honest that she has no time for another husband because she is on her way to the duties of a grandmother...yet she has repeatedly encouraged me to "Go find a really young girl who giggles and enjoys life still.." Age, to her, seems not to matter. She just wants to know when I've found someone, so she can stop being worried for me. I dont see her enough, but suppose I see her exactly as much as I am supposed to.  I can't tell if the answer is in running off to Asia to do whatever, or to stay ...here. I can't tell if the answer is in an Asian woman's arms, or just a young woman's. I can't tell what large chunk of land ruled by whomeever I should be on.  I can't figure out this Tom Robbins thing either. Sickness shivered me all night so I read "Villa Incognito". I probably missed a damnsite of it all, but I know I didn't overall. There seems to be a hell of a vibe going "LOOK OVER HERE YOU FUCKING BLIND IDIOT!!!" as of late. I mean, I take a borrowed Robbins book to a woman because it just seems to be exactly what I need to do, then I meet another woman who advocates reading Robbins and so I do. The themes of the book sound like a laundry list of my questions in life.  I may never write like this, I am closer to hemingway (AAAHHH!!! A heavy handed newspaper hack...but hey..the world needs them too...). I am the fellow who sees the brillant but hasn't yet acheived it. I have also been told by a goodly number of people that I am an amazing teacher of fencing. Last night a person with many degrees, who has yet to lose herself because of it said it in a most wonderful way that touched my soul...but I can't remember. She was thinking if I moved to New Zealand or Australia I could do well in the gig of fencing coach.   I suppose I need to get writing again, before the money taps out. Thats a true path that needs to get followed also. I have been, as ever, trying to hard at it.  I am no better or worse than anyone. I am just myself and not them. they are no better or worse than me, as I am to they.  I remember that night, as I tried to impress Allen Ginesberg, because thats what it was come to think of it. I was sick at the thought of war- so I pulled out 70's bellbottoms and red, white and blue Sly Stone cap to wear to the reading. I got his autograph on my amazing copy of "Howl", and a sly smile which I caught as he exclaimed "Oh! You're so bright! So patriotic!" so my whole attempt to buffon the patriotic war thing backfired completly, but he smile at me. So it's been years as I wonder at the words, that he spoke so relxed and quick, that I always wondered did they have deeper meaning? Did he, where he was in life, see so much more and it just came out his mouth? Probably. Certainly, that night got me to thinking a lot again. I may not have impressed, but I was noticed for sure. I am not better than anyone, just different. I love different.  The new Morrisey disc has a tune that goes on about how he "Likes" a girl because she's not right in the head. This I understand too. I agree wholeheartedly with like girls not right in the head.  God, its light again outside. I hate that. I wish the bedroom door hadn't fallen off, so I could close the light out and pull the room saving shades down and sleep.My own cocoon from the world of daylight and mankind. Maybe I should go to a movie or something. Or work on the Jeep as ever.  "You can choose from phantom fears or some celestial voice..if you choose not to decide you still have made a choice..." I like that thought...I wonder if I should answer the door naked for the next round of JW's that come through.....?  Thats more like it...god I am sick still...

      I began feeling realy bad yesterday at about noon or so. Like something I ate had still been alive or something. It got more and more painful, yet I still had to go teach. I have no idea how I didn't get sick at it all.  I came home to read a book suggested by a friend, or at least the author, and fell asleep on the futon as my illegal alien neighbors seemed to be moving out. There is a trailer out front where I usually park, and my second car is blocked in.  I just awoke with chills and a turned stomach to a most affecting nightmare. I was in a house fairly out in the middle of nowhere with a lot of people I didn't know. Two folks I didn't now had died and for some reason this group was tearing the place apart and taking whatever they wanted. There was a huge four car garage filled with all manner of junk, but many useful and valuable things also. The people were picking the weirdest things to take and ignoring great stuff.  I began to feel sick at it all in the dream. They were tossing off things that probably had great meaning to these people..an Andrew's Sisters record, golf clubs, other smallish things. I saw a guy&nbsp; I used to work with who had vanished a few years back..I called him "The Last Pirate" to his face..because he WAS a pirate, and looked EXACTLY like that one woodcut of Barthlemew Roberts..and was named Roberts. ...he was looking at an Indian motorcycle from the early 70's. It was a dirt bike and basiclly complete, but he was just knocking it over and saying it wasn't worth saving. People out back were in a small canyon breaking things seemingly annoyed at not finding things they wanted.  Nothing ever said WHO the people had been, it was like a time capsule to 1973 in the place, excpet for modern stuff like DVD layers and all. My uncle was there being very annoying. (My uncle is dead and has been for some time. He was always clowning an annoying people and didn' know when to stop. One day, he was at it again and annoyed the hell out of his third wife, who was trying to cook dinner. He kept acting like he was choking and then would grab her when she came to see what had happened. Except this time..she got tired of it and told him to shut the hell up and get ready for lunch. He didn;t come, and she told him she was tired of working so hard to make lunch and stuff to have his clowning ruin things all the time..so she ignored his clowning. Some hours later she went back into the bedroom and found the LAST gurgeled clwning he had been pulling was him being unable to actually speak because he was overweight and had a heart attack and died. He had always been so annoying to me- always going out of his way to be the center of attention, stealing it away from even us little kids like he was in competition for attention. He was a source of constant grief to me.)  I felt bad in the dream, getting sicker and sicker until I was shivering with sickness, the place was being torn apart. In an old bag I found an Epee in perfect shape that was from like 1950 or something. I was weird, had an interchangable tip so it could be dry or electric (nothing like this actually exists) and I took it to my car, along with the DVD player and some stuff like that eveyone was ignoring.  I saw an amazing headbaord that was pure Dean Martin, only to have my father show up and start tearing into it. He was throwing away parts of it...acting like he only wanted the wood for his preciuos stack of wood (Thats another blog entry...). I was heartbroken trying to keep it together. I looked like Palm Springs in 1962 or something.  I woke up for real to find my stomach churning and my body shivering, I feel awful right now and am prety much still mentally asleep and stuck in the nightmare. I hate this feeling, stuck between awake, asleep...and dead. I don't know what thise eans, and when I try and think of it feel like I am going to throw up. I wish I could and just get over it.  Sometimes there is a most ravishing pain at existing between the worlds of life and death that chronic pain that weakens your system brings.My mind feels sick, like its on its last legs in some important way. I feel like I need O2 in it to chase away the feeling of death.  Its nights like these when dreams come back- I have had so very few since my car wreck in 1988, when they used to color my mind every night until then..and now they leave me worried at my own demise in some well known and unexplainable way.  I'd be sared as hell if I didn't feel like throwing up. My neck injuries are raising hell on me and my hands hurt like hell too. Every joint seems to be screaming at me right now. Sickness or something between worlds reaching out? I just don't know.  Sometimes I wonder at death and wonder if it would be so bad, I have so many friends who died already, I feel like I would actually know more people. Right now this sick feeling seems a struggle against just fading off into death myself. Its not a thing I ever take lightly. I hate it so very much and can't accept it, even if it is part of life itself.  I need blankets. The spelling must be awful in this....I smell skunks....

      ..that by now Boozehound is deeply inside the Republican network in Riverside, prepared to do whatever the hell it is she intends to do. I hope that she displays the behavior she is so fond of showing around here...because then maybe they'll lock her up for real!  Dreams...the thoughts..the cats would rip the apartment apart before anyone discovered it. Maybe they would run off to someplace else. Her stuff would get thrown out and a couple of 25 year old Japanese girlchild twins with a fetish for PuffyAmiYumi, Anime and fencing would move in to the place....  oh wait..I'm working on moving...yeah..so the twins move in and fall on hard times finiancially and have to move with me into my second bedroom.....  Oh..it'll never happen. She'll get arrested again, tossed into the nutbin for months, and everyone will feel sorry for her doing stupid things. Rent will be ignored, and she will be allowed to catch up just like last time. In the mean time, the local courst will go insane destroying my life over a data entry error on my speeding ticket.....  I need a dog. Dogs are cool...something named "K-9" with a laser in his nose....

      Lord.   Sometimes things just happen. The boozehound cornered me to drag me to her place to see some anti-government website she discovered. She has been drinking wine again and is loud. That, as&nbsp;a matter of fact, scares me. She's a nutcase. Sometimes they are lovable, but I have seen the "Dark Side" of her everyone else ignores.   SO..she finally admits that the reason she was in prison so long was they declared her a nutcase.    SEE..I KNEW IT!!!           &nbsp;     I am afraid I have been evil...and wonder why I can't get the text looking normal again either.     Oh, that's better. You see, BH sends e-mails to everyone from the president on down speaking her mind. Usually, now that I've been subjected to a barrage of them as she showed off..they say highly pointed and focused things like "YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE AND I HOPE YOUR CHILDREN DIE." Which, of course, is the exact way to effect great positive change in this world and the next few.    BH is constantly saying all sorts of lightweight Michael Moore type things..so (and this is the possibly evil part), I took control of her computer and sent her to all sorts of sites she never heard of before. Threw out names of important Seal Team Six type people and the lot. I am supposing by tomorrow morning, in her drunken haze, she will have e-mailed them to everyone from the DNC on down to the local college radio station. Sooner or later I am going to see the shadowy dark figures of Mr Bush's Ninja's as they race away across the rooftops having dispatched her. Oh wait, COMIC CON flare up again..sorry world...   I am sorely depressed that I never found the "Bob the Angry Flower" booth last weekend. As far as I can tell, "Sinfest" was not there either..Megatokyo, however, was rocking...   I'm sorry, I dig the whole Japanese dealio. I LOVE PuffyAmiYumi unreservedly. I think Shonen Knife are groovy as hell. I love the art, the attitude..as little as I understand of it. I love the people..the long hair rock guys striking out (Loudness was so cool all those years ago...and friends of the first musicians I met here.). the chicks who rule the world and the old people who look so good at any age. I so want to go there. I might not make it back, I think I could really fall into the place like a sailor in a whorehouse after a 2 year tour with no leave.....   Anyway..the shout out goes to a new on-line friend with a soul living under a poet's moon. I'm wondering if she got my e-mails I sent direct to her account and not just comments I sent to her. I wonder if she ever heard "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" from back when Genesis was fucking awesome..? I'm dying to exchange e-mails or IM this groovio person. It ain't often you stumble into someone cool. So I make the effort..I try...to say Hello ! Send me messages..!   OK..time to do soemthing, anything creative...see ya Cats and Clones....

      Well, its about time to address the issue of bad spelling and sentence structure in this here little old blog. I'll try and list reasons why they end up as far as the actual published page:   1.&nbsp; Its the car wreck thing, gave me a case of dyslexia that is damned annoying. I only see the problems some days later when I go back and think, "Fuck all, how did THAT get past me?"   2.&nbsp; I am practicing to be a published author. Its been said that one must leave mistakes in a submission, or the editors will have nothing to do. If they have nothing to fix, then they start tearing into your story, just to prove their worth and keep their jobs.   3.&nbsp; I am trying to spell more phonetically so as to be able to better communicate with my younger students who live on AOL IM...OMG!!1!!!!!1111!!! WTF!!!!!!1!!   4.&nbsp; I am usually exhausted (did you catch it? Just testing...) beyond actual words description and can't tell if I am posting to a blog or writing somewhere else.   5.&nbsp; I don't care anyway. I just don't care.   6.&nbsp; I am trying to regain the glory of youth by having a bad attitude and acting like I don't care.   7.&nbsp; There is no number seven. I am the new Number Two. Who is number One? YOU are Number Six!   8.&nbsp; If I did things too well Rover would bounce out of the stream behind my place, chase me down and kill me for it.   9.&nbsp; My brain seems firmly stuck at Comic Con and distracted.   10.&nbsp; What was this list about again?

      OK world, its the Comic Con thing..are the Klingon refs. But it is funny what a subculture exists around this work of fiction! Writers, in the end, rule the world!   I had a thought I forgot to record. I noticed a great number of people into the whole fantasy world are like me. That means..an only kid. Now this world of theirs can be relaxed and a part of things, or can be pushed way too far. My reach into this world doesn't make me want to make costumes, it make me want to write novels and movies. Oh the thinly vieled cry for acceptance!!!!;<>!!!!  Yeah, because what it gets down to is that being an only child sucks. I have no close relatives at all. I have nothing really...so being an only kid has given me all sorts of "Issues" as Dr Phil would say...! People think THEY are awkward...HA..Welcome to my Nightmare... (Sing it to that old Alice Cooper tune!).  I never quite know when I have talked too much. You see, I always took silence as "Crap..I said something WRONG again..! Now I MUST TALK until I have smoothed it out and made it all work!" (Funny, I have come to find that what I ACTUALLY did was so overwhelm everyone with such a complex and on-going line of talk that I INTIMIDATED them instead of talked to them. Thats fucking FUNNY!)  Then there is the realtionship thing. You see, I don't know how to be human. I don't know when a touch on the shoulder is the right thing, or a smack on the butt in jest. Or whatever. Because..well..there was no one else around growing and learning with me! So, I read books instead. I never got into a fight with a brother or sister, never chased a cousin around (There are 2 cousins, but we were never close...barely saw them). Never punched someone in friendship, or pushed them down in appreciation...all those human things folks learn as kids.  That, of course, is the root of the problem with my on-going (but now at least understood) complete mistaking of SEX for LOVE. Come on, its terrifiying to TOUCH someone when you haven't had that learning curve spelled out in the last paragraph. I also fell in love with every one who ever had sex with me. Which..sometimes...people it seems just have sex with each other because it is there. Damn...next thing you know folks will be off climbing mountains for so much of a reason!  So I had this idea some years ago. I was in Arizona for a big competitoion, and the hotel was OVERRUN with twins and more. They had their own special club..you couldn't be in it without a twin. Funny thing was, most of these people were hugely more dorky than I've ever been.,...but they had this safety in numbers thing going down...so nobody laughed at them. Wel, I did, I was in a mood. OK, &nbsp;I was drunk..and I had to ask as many as possible what the hell the deal was with dressing alike..and maybe a different HAIRCUT might give them some INDIVIDUALITY..but I was roundly shunned.   Oh yeah, the Idea..I was thinking I should form an "Only Child" club! You know, we'ed rent hotels, plan events mingle and get to know others. We'd be THERE for our brothers and sisters in solitude! We could take on the world together..a lone family!  Oh course, truth is, we would all probably dress well, show up to the dinner the first night..and the first one in would pick a table with no one at it. Then, the same thing would happen until all the tables were taken. Those who came in afterwards would either search around, pretend they left something in their room and leave to avoid having to sit near a stranger, or act like they had walked into the wrong room. Others would get loud and long winded in their attempt to cover up their sheer terror.  The music for the evening, of course, would be all solo acts. Just one person, twisting in shyness under the spotlight, trying to express themselves. Tori Amos, Nelly MacKay, those sorts of things. We would all apallaud and nod without making eye contact with others. I guess that leave the reformed Trapp Family Singers out of the program...oh well, no one else would confess their love for "The Sound of Music" because it was the only taste of a family they ever had either!  If anyone asked another a question, we'd answer, and then excuse ourselves to the restroom to make sure we didn't say something that offended anyone. In there, the sheer horror of all those people avoiding the main room would hit us, driving us back to the dinner. HOWEVER..I was thnking..I would put booze in everyone's drinks...that should do the trick...not mine though..god knows everyone hates a sincere drunk searching for acceptance. Then again, no one would actually SAY anything about it.  Let's see, what else....well it would actually be funny to a degree to watch a room full of people who have no idea how to fit in trying to do that. I noticed once that a number of times I ran into people with big families..and found out both parents had been only kids. I found that so interesting. Maybe it was just nice to have someone to touch without fear, maybe it was a blind ambition to populate the world, or maybe it was booze. Who can tell?&nbsp; (Sidenote: It was never going to work with my ex. Nice person from a big family. Her response to EVERYTHING was to run into another room and slam the door so she could be left alone. NOPE..now I'VE done something wrong and have to beg forgiveness for it!..which don't play well to someone who always got out of facing issues through solitude in a mass setting).  So Comic Con was rather fun. I think I have been so damned shy, so damned whatever that I pushed everyone away or drove them away by talking too much. I used the weekend to just be myself *shudder!*. I found that people actually seem to like me. What a concept!  Funny, I meet a porn star and everybody else wants to fuck her. I found her eyes and the small wrinkles around them interesting. I found her accent from the east coast, so barely covered intriguing. I want coffee with her and conversation. I want to know how she got to where she is, and if she's actually OK as she acts. Sex..whatever...but for ONCE&nbsp; didn't fall in love with her. I did smile though. Smiles are nice.  Its so funny how all these people try to be loners- I wish I could give them my life for a few months. There would be a lot less Goths running around out there. Probably lead to a lot more Trapp Family Singers though.  Makes me think of my friend, the msuician in LA I have known for like 12 years. She's an only child and still a virgin. I have always found here so attractive and been terrified of touching her. There's a paradox "I want to sex you until..well..I don't think we need to talk about the end point yet..but I'm too shy to do so. Whats your favorite band again..?"  Funny thing, mostly it gives one no baseline to set against in most matters..this only child deal. You drift and never feel grounded. You have no confidence because you don't know what it feels like, you overacheive because you don't know when to stop..or maybe you kill yourself thinking you are a failure. Mostly, for me, the word "Awkward" sums it up. Mostly, for me, I have NO self-confidence (which is the mother of this maddening procrastination). How very funny that everything in this life has failed, except teaching fencing. Something NOBODY trhinks they can do. I find that the actual teaching is no big deal, it just takes effort, but here am I, scared, talking too much, awkward and under confident...instilling confidence into others...for a living! Irony is a funny motherfucker!  Then again, no one prowls the night like only kids. We make cats look loud and cumbersome. I love teh sneak of the night and the protection it gives, the warmth and the way its arms hold me. I need a nice long drive somewhere. maybe later..maybe later....;<>!!  Until then, I just think that maybe we should all acknowledge Bender as God.

      Well..so much for the best lasid plands of mice and men. I awoke very late today, and in a great degree of pain from the old war wounds. I think I stood too much yesterday without a break- the knees are not in working order. Thus..all my plans of conquest have been ..sidetracked, as I missed today's Comic Con.  I have laid in plans for next year. I'll go during the week for the first few days when nobody is there, and do the seminars that seem interesting on the weekend, so I can see everything. Makes sense, at least I got a feel for the deal now.  So as for planning, I got to work on the Jeep yet again. Its getting down to little details now..reinstall bumpers, tow hitches, trim, latches, catches and bottles, switches and wihoses and wires...and I THINK all under the hood has been restored to a 1977 Glory. Its very complete and clean under the hood. Its 98% on the outside. I have discovered a few more things that need replacement, but since they are details they really need to be replaced to complete the projrct. maybe 30 dollars more of expense to go.  Do I want to sell it now? No, the sentimental side of me that never wants to get rid of anything wants to store it away forever...but then again, its like a prson to store a car. The more you drive the better they run, the less you run them, the more they rust...and I like to keep mine all Shiney-Shiney. It needs a new home. Rather like any other object of value, the more someone pays for it, the more someone an be expected to take care of it.  Th other side of me is going nuts from boozehounds, illegal alien neighbor children who are known to steal, cats, and just generally weirdness. I also relaize I don't want my friends over her ever because I am so ashamed of the dump. That sucks. No matter how hard one tries, you can NEVER polish a turd. I have found this to be true once again.  So I have tests to grade and comments to write by e-mail to students. I need a shower now and to get to work, so I am clear to go out tomorrow morning early and get some stuff done. Perhaps by this time tomorrow the Jeep will be officially done?  Wage Peace...!

      What else can one say? I met the person most responsible for change in my life..Roger Dean. He did the album cover art for the band "Yes" all the way back. His artwork caught my eye and turned me onto Prog Rock...something outside of Jazz I was so into. My life has never been the same since...  We spoke at some length, and I discovered much to my amazement and joy he also weilds steel. He used to fence Sabre but has long since gotten into Kendo. I wouldn't expose the details of the conversation we had- but it was, I can already tell...another key point in my life!  Then the "Networking" button switched on, and I saw openings everywhere. I talked to so many cool people. I got cards and asked abour certain projects that had been sitting at the back of my mind for some time. I got a lot of leads onto how to get somewhere with them.  There is an actress of no small acclaim I have gravitated towards a number of times at conventions, as she is going in a very Eileen Caddy sort of direction. I gave her a book by Eileen she is yet to read. I want to ask her out to coffee or something just to have time to tell her about some things I know of that would play out very well for her...rather then her reinventing the wheel. She may be moving back to her home country as a result of some business issues, so I guess I need to drive back to San Diego tomorrow and ask if I can.  I spoke at no small length to a woman porn star also. Now, one would think I want to fuck her, but not really. (I mean if she asked I wouldn;t say no..DUH!), but I stumbled onto her deal, didn't know her and was ever curiuos about who people are and what they do.  Not THAT part! No..I wanted to know if she was going to work it and go into production someday..to find she already owns her own production company. It got me to thinking about an old idea..about a girl I used to love who was murdered..and wondering if somehow the story could be filmed with an "X: rating..but not be directly a porn film. There is something about a "Super Realism" or an almost Pre-Rapehlelite Brotherhood depection of the events that would serve the story well. I have thought for years that a film of true grit and truth, with pure and actual sex scenes in it, and also those kind of horrible things that happen in real life might be an advance in the film making world. But in another way just need this out of my head....yet another reason to go back.  God I want to create something that matters..if not children then art.  Time for sleep so I can drive back- this time alone to move at my own pace. There is so much to be done for one short life.  Wage Peace!

      This would be that post, that famous #100 in the series, later to be read by scholrs and critics alike to chart the path wrought upon me for my life, fame, fortune and everything that goes with it (I thank you all..) that may happen hereafter.  So what does one talk about in the 100 post one asks? Well, I think it srather obviuos that one speaks of the graces of the more amazing members of the opposing sex. Thusly we begin.  My hairdressor is godawful hot. She's about 30, total little skinny rock and roll chick. ALWAYS dressed rock and roll, cool shit done to her hair and stuff. I LOVE talking to her and have asked her out a number of times. Twice, she has destroyed her car in a wreck (No...is a simplier way of avoiding the dreaded date if its an issue.) She is sexy, intelligent, and all her friends are married and she's bored. I want her. I guess she could be "MHD". My Hair Dressor.  There is a chick at the best record store in the area, she is also skinny as a rail and sexy as hell. Of course she is all rock and roll working there. She has an amazing amount of tattoos all over her body. I want to see her naked to see all of them, I also want to see her naked so I can have wild and non-stop sex with her. She is damned intelligent and I am dying to talk to her at length. I beleive she has a dumbass marine boyfriend who has no idea the prize he has in her. I want to get closer to her, so when he bloews it (marines always do...) I can dive in for the kill. I so want her. I guess she could be"RSG" Record Store Girl.  There is another chick that I am unsure of her age, but I am guessing it would send me to jail to kiss her. She isn't as skinny, has nice curves and is the funniest, and cutest package I may have yet seen in a woman. I have woken up with dreams about her if I wanted them or not. In the aspct of what I like about females, she has it all partly because of her race, and partly because of who she is. I can't have her and it makes me crazy I tell you, crazy... I guess she could be "TOISN" The One I Shouldn't Notice.  10 years ago I would have bedded all of them already. Now, I want someone for who they are, and don't wanna screw it up by just bedding them. I am in no need of notches.  But, if I have to die soon, I'd like to do so after having had a night of long, hot, sweaty and fulfilling sex and conversation with just these three woman...OK? Thank you god....

      So its this time of the night when I have finally worn myself out enough to have only one or two thoughts going at once. I have been trying to rather get at the root of my problems in general. The biggest of which is the annoying habit of having 11 things going at once. I mean, I can't go work on the car...I have to strip the hood with a sander, primer it, while it is drying wash dishes, while they are drying put in a load of laundry, go back and check the hood, weetsand it, finish putting away the dishes, run and throw the clothing in the dryer, check my e-mails and phone messages, toss a topcoat on the hood, fold the laundry and push the car bck into the garage. That about handles 3 hours.  Is it any wonder I get so little done? At a 9-5 job I was so limited in what I had to do that I always got it done before anyone..better and faster in every way. I suppose this burn of energy is why most bosses are terrified of me. They always think I am out to take their job...when its the last thing in the world I care about. I just want a steadt income to funs my mad adventures..my life is always away from work- but those 9-5 jobs took a heavy toll on me with all the backstabbing and jerking around. I guess I am sti;; trying to break the time wasting habits of that portion of them with all this screwing around.  I used to think I wanted like 3 women in my life at any given time...as lovers and more. I know now that isn't true. Trying to actually build a harem all those years ago (for all due purposes) is enough to kill oneself. Everytime I hear some guy spouting off about all the women he has I can tell he is lying...if they really had all that many they would be more menatlly exhausted, and the last thing they would want to do is talk about it. All these so called "Players" are fakes for the most part. Going to a whore is whoring, not having more women.  I'm like a race car, I have a high performance chassis, but I need a track to dump it on and run the shit out of. I used to have some 50 or so issues/ projects that needed to be done and am down to like three now. That's progress. Some went away because they were a waste of energy to even want..I am happier without the complexity of that desire or what I thought was a need (a big house/ an overly fancy car/ etc). Funny, the things left are simple enough: Turn all 12 story outlines into novels, buy an older mobile home to live in so I can reduce expense, sleep until the crack of noon, go to a movie during the day when everyone else is slaving away, read a book....a focus on the much more simple. I am actually nearing a quiting point on the Jeep and its a weird feeling knowing I may actually sell it, and that I would have a certain freedom from the possision of it.  Years ago Val loaded her Miniture Dobie named Sid Viciuos into her 1967 Thunderbird, her clothes and that was it. She declared there are only two ways to be truely free: To have enough money to have everything, or to have so little money you have nothing. Either way, you have the freedom to move and live as you like. I thought then I still wanted everything. I know now she was a bodhivatsa showing me the way. I so wish I could have found her in Vegas to chat with. I always fall hard for the lesbians don't I? I still am amazed that she was 20 with an 90 year old soul.   Guess I need to get to the money part- maybe even get seriuos about a 9-5 job for a while. Sell the Jeep, move, get some income to boost marketing for the business and do the two major things that I need moeny for...go to the Findhorn Foundation in Scotland and Lasik surgery so I can get rid of these ever annoying glasses. Then again, whatever needs to happen will do just that.

      Almost forgot the best way to have fun at work.  &nbsp;First, take a look at the Blue Screen of Death and get an idea of what it looks like. Then, go into Paint or something and make something that looks as close to that as possible. Now, toss it on a floppy disc, and go around to every computer in the office and place it on the computers as a wallpaper. (Be sure you didn't make it at work, unless you used someone else's computer.) Now, send a message to IT that your computer is frozen and you can't do your job...from every computer you put it on. Since its the wallpaper, if nothing else is running they'll spend countless amounts of time trying to figure out why they get the message the second the thing boots up every time.  Sit back and watch IT come back from work.  OR..just do it late one weekend after everyone is gone and see what happens Monday as IT wanders in two hours later than everyone to see a wall of moniters with the BSOD on them....  Or....just steal the balls out of everybody's mouse.....when someone freaks just&nbsp;say, "Oh, you must have a girl mouse..."  &nbsp;

      Well, for me at least. I have to sign up as many folks for testing as possible tonight. I need to get this program implemented and rolling for everyoine's good. I have nearly finished the second level in this weapon..and certain students in a third weapon are going to be running up against the limits of what I've written as a lesson plan very soon. Time to get back to work! Once all six levels are worked out, with pre-reqs and all, it will be easier. I have come to the grand idea that once past a certaain level, a requirement will be to become a class assistant. Why not, its how eveyone else does it..and it burns the details into their minds like no other fashion I can do.  Been thinking a lot about women as of late. Not bad things. No, I'm not saying that I don't think women are bad things. No..I mean, I am saying I am thinking of them (women) without a negitive context! There..that's better. Women are good for many things, one can lean against them on the sofa while reading a book. Every so often they'll buy you a coffee, and sometimes they will allow you to buy them one. I have even heard tales of more mutual sharing of life itself, but squint my eyes and wonder who makes these wild stories up...? Next thing you know they'll be telling us that stuff that goes into a Black Hole CAN actually escape it in some fashion.....  &nbsp;&nbsp; Women, they certainly are nice to look at. I just read this rant in a magazine by a woman going on and on about how her best friend was so sexy and got all the attention. She described herself as rather plain, dark hair and thoughtful, while her friend was a big boobed ditz that all the guys stared at. I was wondering if this woman was yet another that ignored me at some point when I TRIED to go shower her with attention...because..damn it...not EVERYBODY thinks the same things are attractive! I would think she is, until I saw she's never been out of North Carolina. Great...and trapped in boredom too. Poor thing, she needs a lost weekend in TJ with far too much dancing, far to much drinking, far to much worshiping the moon and finding someone has left an ear and a a tail in her purse (obscure bullfighting ref no one will get) when she digs through it at work on Monday.  Life is supposed to be for living. Living can sometimes hurt... many things cause pain, death of someone dear, death in general, getting dumped, getting trapped, getting the idea you allowed yourself to get screwed (not in the fun weekend noted above sense), countless things.   &nbsp; Pain however, tempers the blade you forge by your actions. Too much pain and the blade is brittle, too little and its too soft to weild. It takes just the right amount of both to get a perfect balance, and everyone is different. I wonder who I am telling all this too...;<>..?!?!? Thats the cool thing about a Blog, you can just spew it out, and delete it later when you figure out you had too much to drink.  Like Christmas Day at a friend's house. I swore never again, I get sincire when drunk, I also get inquizitive..great, like a big wasted cat wanting to leap upon the table of life I guess. I really don't want to know what I said that day, but haven't been drunk sense. A stout here and there, but no need to get drunk. I think maybe drinking to that point is some part of a great pagan ritual that I haven't had occasion to taste yet.  Speaking of Pagan, my dear friend, former student with the yearling boy child should be visiting mommy and daddy soon, so we'll get to do coffee and I can hold the child again. He is a mamma's boy already, but I am sure he will grow into a woman chasing terror by his teens..I know..I met his dad. Funny, his dad is losing his hair. Such a good looking fellow too, oh well..maybe there IS a god!  If so, he lead me away from booze and into coffee. Coffee seems so much nicer on the soul somehow. Being wired is good. I can't stand these bookstores of late..the smell of books, coffee and women all mingeled into one. See, somehow we loop right back to girls again. You know, they are all girls as long as there is that devilish twinkle in their eyes. Sometimes it just needs a nudge to awaken.  My friends from Mexico City are working too hard, we never get to have a glass of wine together anymore. Maybe thats good, if I go over there I won't be able to take my eyes off the younger one....who is much of a dear friend as her mom is. But geez...she's a wacky cool chick. We don't really talk when we have been alone, we start sentences and disolve into laughter knowing full well the answer.  &nbsp;The FUNNIEST thing in the last five years was mom sending her and me to the store for something for dinner she was making. We got there, and both of us completly forgot what we were after. She asked, "Great, what should we do?" I had the sly answer, "We walk around the store with a cart and buy anything that looks good to us, maybe we'll get what we were sent for, and then we lie and say we just felt like picking a few other things up." We couldn't see through the tears of agreement...and mom certainly rolled her eyes at the four bags of groceries we came back with. She had that Latin Woman Look going on..."WHAT in the HELL did you tw DO...?!" Finally, rather than go on with the lie- I told mom. She just shook her head and said , " I should have known..." Daughter said...," I TOLD you not to send the TWO of us!" Private joke between us...rather like when we were having dinner and talking about the Ent in the second LOTRs film that had burning hair..only to have daughter swing her head in impersonation, and flop her hair fully into the gravy boat....and only I saw it...and they wonder why we just start laughing...damn..why can't SHE be a couple years older? oh well,....she will be in a few years....what ever that means...  &nbsp; 51 Out..for now...

      Taught tonight..Sabre..two students remain and they are working at it. One has finally found his place in fencing..its so cool to see.  Got home to answer e-mails and the such, worked on the Jeep for hours and hours doing stupid me tricks as I went. Got much done. I may actually see the end soon. Got the white spoke wheels touched up amazingly well among other things...  &nbsp;&nbsp; Busted knuckles a great deal also..not too good. I wonder if I meet John for breakfast tomorrow? He never let me know....I wonder if I should just stay up..?  &nbsp; Got a cool e-mail from a new friend...they seem really intelligent and focused..and nice. The world is a better place when you meet nice people....  &nbsp; My back and legs are killing me, too much of a workout Sunday, but that's fine, it was worth it. Spoke to an old, dear friend today- she is getting married and I am happy for her. Wish I could go drinking with her one more time before then though. It'll be hard to have open conversations like we can now once she is living wth someone again. I think she is the only one that understand the depth of the pain I feel at having lost my three best friends so long ago, so close together. I probably would have lost it without her to cry to for a while. She has confided back to me, which is good.   OK...off to shower and sleep and start running again..I may require an afternoon nap to function tomorrow night in class at this point.  Wage..PEACE!!

      Nothing too big today, just got a fair amount of repair stuff done on the never ending Jeep project. I tried to remember all the annoying things about the Jeep, so I would want to sell it...but realized I have repaired pretty much every annoying thing that it ever did. Not the end result I was looking for.  Found out that if I were buying a house, what I pay in rent would purchase something worth about 175,000 bucks. More than I ever want to spend for sure...but it all becomes invetment and capitol to get loans against in the end. Oh the scheming I could do with loans....BUT..I have to focus on old/ used/ small/ outlying and try to spend no more than 15,000 bucks total..so I can pay it off pretty quick.  Got an e-mail from someone I posted a comment to on a blog- sounds like a really cool person, and I hope I can get a dialouge going with them...sort of an electronic pen pal dealy. That would be cool. Its so hard to meet new people these days. Other than discovering the place for Boba Tea, internet dating has proven a diaster in more ways than one to me!  Speaking of which..a woman who I met on-line, in a racy chat room called "Intimate Encounters" last year (who dumped me big time...for another guy who then dumped her...) has been in touch. We got together for the sole purpose of getting naked, then she acted like she wanted more- then freaked and left. Anyway- she has, out of the blue, been back in touch saying things like "We should get together some time...". Finally, she tells me she has "a friend" she spends most of her waking hours with..who, after 9 months, made a pass at her. Now she is freaked out. She only wants a friend but is horny..which, I guess, is why she got ahold of me again. GREAT..am I destined to always be "The Other Man"? I think not. I have been civil, but never want to touch her again. I don;t wanna be second best to anyone. If she wants sex..maybe I could charge her...I mean..at least it would benefit me then...;<>!!!  Oh well, I am very tired, and ts earlier than usual..need sleep...!  Goodnight world.....  &nbsp;

      Oh wait, I've seen a number of their films..they already have it!!! Chances are, I will be unable to get the phrase "Pig Slop" out of my mind for years and will therefore resign myself to flogging it well past its own decent death.  &nbsp;  I hurt like hell after class tonight, but a rush of not hurting came into play after a handful of pain killers. This is good- other than the fatc I am wired and can't sleep (what else is new..?) things seem OK overall.  &nbsp;  So I am killing the location I live nearest too. I can't deal with the stress of things is the biggest reason. Next, with all the building/ not building/ rent increase/ lack of service/ etc...it does rather seem like time to move along. I am learning more and more about housing costs. I am determined to spend as little as possible to get about the same square footage I have now- if only for an exercise. From what I can tell, I should be able to knock a few hundred off my monthly expense this way. That would be good, as I can dump it into advertising.  &nbsp;  Today I got 4 calls in 20 minutes about classes. EVERY one of them had like a 5 year old. CHRIST..does NO ONE actually READ the website? It has "Lower age limit of 12, No Exceptions" listed in like every page except one. I guess everyone thinks their child is the only one who would be excused. Funny, when I challenge them to join the class and then take the lessons home to the child until the child turns 12..I get a solid "NO..I couldn't possibly do  that!! " So if I understand right, their child is the most special one on the planet, I am supposed to break every rule I have to accommodate them, but they will stand by and do nothing. ...yeah..EXACTLY the kind of parents I want around my place. Also exactly the kind that freak out when little Johnny shows no skill what so ever after finding out fencing is WORK..and not just waving his plastic ninja sword at the cat....which, of course, will be MY fault for not keeping him happy. &nbsp; I was going to say something positive but can't remember what it is. Oh yeah- if I can clear the Monday night slot I hope to get back to LA every week to work under my Mastro once again.Perhaps I could then get time to date the girl I like in town I have known for far too long. I could, in effect, stay Monday nights in LA after class, and then get back in time for later class. &nbsp; Yep. Need to get this business rolling so I have time to do as I please. I got more stuff done today on tests and lessons, what a chore. Once its all down on paper I can relax and just steer the ship a little better. Then again, I have three wepaons and three more levels to write to stay ahead of the bunch. I think maybe a "Competitive" class will be a lot more loosely based then the current levels..so at any point I can toss out..."Everybody just fence tonight..." when I hurt as bad as I did tonight. &nbsp; The moon is just a sliver tonight. I like it dark.

      Wow...looks like   Blogger      has gone nuts  with  features. That's pretty cool. I'll have to get something to load as a photo. I so remember the world before computers, all the paperwork, the issues, how many people it took to do things. People bitch that jobs are going away...they are just shifting. Years ago there were specialized jobs for everything...now they have become data entry type jobs that require a lot less skill...yet people STILL can't figure them out ...weirdness.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Monthly it looks like things never get done for me until about the 20th, a fact I've discovered by reading my own blog entries. This is yet another useful internet/ computer tool.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am way behind in answering e-mails, and I didn't have the "Lost in Las Vegas" weekend I had last weekend. I have slept through the hottest part of the days, until the swamp coller just can't keep up and I awake. Then I work late into the night. I have so many plans/ programs/ ideas to sort out and complete. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I have completly revamped my private group for my students. Instead of printing pages that I find tossed on the floor just after class, I'm treating it like every other modern business in the world. They have access to a website that stores all the document sthey may need. If they go to the competition level outside the club, they'll HAVE to access all the information over the internet anyway, so I see it as a training tool to get them used to using the technology. &nbsp; &nbsp; Months ago I rewrote my lesson plans to make them 8 week courses in the same format, instead of 12 week courses. I had printed copies, but handed some out to people who actually needed them...only to find I couldn't find them ANYWHERE between three computers. Tonight I stumbled onto them in the strangest place I can't even describe, and spent all night renaming them to make them clearer, setting up folders that make sense, and tranfering files back and forth until it all is easy to access. In each weapon I have a testing section, and each section has duplicates of forms needed for testing...just in case! &nbsp; &nbsp; I dumped the data on a disc from a friend into my system, to find he had brought me exactly everything I already HAD from him instead of the ONE file I NEED from him. That's OK, he brought a hard copy, so I'll probably just re-enter the whole 4 pages to get it done. &nbsp; &nbsp; I got a fair amount of auto repair done also, with some of the final repainting issues looking like I may finally get them right this time. That lead into much driving and looking around the area for a place to move to. I am beginning to see an opening just the next town over. They have a bunch of mobile home parks, and while not my dream house..yet...its a step towards it. &nbsp; &nbsp; I need to get all these projects/ testing/ issues/ auto repair work just finished, so I can work 9-5 on my novel. I must finish it soon. November is fast upon us, and I have a solid goal for it this year. That is if I can find my notes....

      So I have come to understand that compared to 95% of the people with blogs I am a perfectly happy individual. I have day to day crap...but I'm not worried about the sex life of a sister-in-law/ sister/ cousin/ ex-wife/ neighbor/ hen/ zoo animal/ boy/ man/ duck/ aircraft/ etc I want to bang, or what it really means when the neighbors look at me funny or any other bizarre shit.  They look at me funny because they are druggies and drunks, that's pretty simple. The other one is an illegal alien with offspring who touch things they don't own...repeatedly. One is kicking drugs, good luck and more power to him. One has too many fucking cats, which I didn't used to HATE, but am becoming increasingly annoyed with.  I have decided its normal to be annoyed when you open your front door to be greeted with a boozehag sticking a nasty little beast in your face and drooling on about how it thinks its a person.  I have decided its normal to be pissed off when people don't watch their kids and then expect to blame everyone else when they get injured or killed.  I have decided its normal to be sick and tired of everyone around me acting like the world is out to get them when their problems are the result of their own choices and actions.  I have decided I need to live anywhere else than here, and probably the vast hinterlands of the boonies would suffice nicely. I'd rather deal with bears than illegal alien children. Bears I can shoot and no one wants to put me in jail for making a terorist threat for it.  I have decided to vote for Kerry, just as a sign of solidarity to get GWB OUT of the White House, no matter how good or bad Kerry might be. I don't care. I want Bush and the havoc he has wreaked on this country dead and gone. It's a simple matter of numbers, I might prefer to vote for someone else...but hell, when Ralph Nader says "Vote Kerry instead of me to get GWB out of the White House.." I think I'll listen. Thanks Ralph...didn't like "Unsafe at Any Speed" but at least you cared enough to try. Bet you wish you had bought a bunch of Corvairs now don't ya?  I have decided it was so cool to actually quit a job again rather than hang on until the bitter end.  I have decided that cheap marketing is best and hope to make my fortune with it. Signs, Signs...everywhere signs...upping my income all of the time....  I have decided that women in the USA are 99% out for a wallet no matter what they say.  I have decided that if and when a female should enter my life again is a pretty good time frame.  I have decided to live on island time (as Jimmy Buffet calls it) and seem all of a sudden to be happier.  I have decided that once I get the immediate projects done, I'll have no excuse to get in the way of the REAL projects.  I have decided that I feel better again and even some women look OK again.  I have decided that I will do as I damn well please at this apartment, and if I am told not to I will pitch a fit and "Stand up for myself" in the same annoying/ drunken/ incoherent fashion as the boozehound.  I have decided that I am annoyed that I work hard to keep any and all autos both running well and looking good while boozehound has left a destroyed auto sit without attentiuon for over a year, three other cars sit abandoned and sad and yet I look like a probelm to boozehound.  I have decided I like guns of all shapes and sizes. Except pistoils, which I will abide by but never really like.  I have decied a cross bow would be a good project to construct from scratch once the major projects are gone. God save the car whose leaf springs appear to be the correct size for my bow.  I have decided that I need to know everything about black powder guns.  I have decided that swords are still as cool as ever, and once I work the kinks in my arms out I need to drill with actual weapons in the front yard to keep away cats, children and boozehounds.  I have decided that music or all sorts, except that canned mexican crap from next door, is good enough.  I have decided that I don't care about most things, because they are an immense waste of my time.  I have decided that I shouldn't bother being worried if I can do nothing to change it (whatever IT is..), well, short of explosives..which COULD change most anything. Hey..wait a minute...  I hve decided that if people promise to meet up for excercise and don't, I won't call again for days and just go on my own.  I have decided its kinda late and I need sleep.  I have decided to finish this and log off.  Really.

      I sent an e-mail today quitting my 9-5 job, it hasn't been any fun anyway so screw it. I spent the rest of the day repairing equipment, cleaning equipment and making phjone calls. I found an e-mail I missed from my 9-5 from a month ago and replied to it. Oh well...I don't care anymore. If any of you want to get screwed under by goody two shoes born again christian bitches with too many kids by lots of men she can't ID...feel free to call her for it.  I have thrown boxes of shit out today, I have no idea where all this useless shit comes from. Lots of it is junk mail I never bother to open until I finally toss it out. Then its just as useless as I thought it was. I am so tired now..and still have to go teach tonight...bummer.  Oh well, signs are ready tomorrow and maybe a couple new students in the hell location.

      Maybe that's what I actually need. It's been now 9 months or stomach hell for me and my digestion. I finally feel a touch better and seem to be rolling in a little of a direction.  Lets hope the signs I ordered make a change in the cash flow issue around the business. Its getting the word out thats hardest. I need to really establish myself before someone else blows into town and reaps the rewards of all my efforts of the last ten years. That could be read as anyone with money....  Took a ride tonight and saw a lot of mobile homes in Yucaipa, looks like it may be a lot nicer place to live than I figured. It was like 9:00 pm and actually really quite quiet. Might just work out for now.

      It's funny sometimes when you try and run away from everything to get a break- that you end up right back on the front door step of where you left.  I went to the desert to watch High Power Rockets (Large and Dangerous Rocketships) being flown. I got there a touch later than I wanted and was almost hit by one landing when I drove up. I had to take care not to run over another as I went to park. Soon after, a small one attempted to get airbourne only to go wildly out of control in my immediate direction. Instead of running, I stood watching it loop and loop close and closer towards me. Fencing taught me it wasn't close enough to be a threat, so don't go wastng energy running around until you need to do so. It hit the ground nearly 20 feet away...layed there until it burned out...and then in an anti-climatic "POP" the nose cone popped off from the ejection charge. Poor little thing. It was, however, in perfect shape so that was cool. Who knows why it flew that way?  So I saw a few decent launches..right up into the clouds, and they had to radio track the rockets to find them as everyone lost sight of them. I was bored when the wind closed it down for the day at about 2:30 pm. I had never been north on the 247, so decided to see how far away from State Line it was. I figured that NOT getting hit by 3 rockets meant it was my lucky day...I needed to capitailize on this luck.  It wasn't too far away, so I went to all the casinos there...Whiskey Pete's, Buffalo Bills, Pimm something or other.....and then figure I might as well go to Vegas...being only like 40 more miles away. I had no idea what I was looking for anyway.  Just outside of town was a billboard...of all things.Lynyrd Skynyrd was playing! OK..time for a Skynyrd show I guess.  The show was very good, the ciggie smoke annoying as hell and the slots played OK overall. I got home at 5 this morning thinking about how much I miss about Florida and wondering why the hell I ever moved to California. Then again, I would have been miserable if I hadn't tried it I guess. I need a place to live away from th annoying mexican neighbors and all the women and children who aren't on the lease and aren't supposed to be here. Another "Laws for YOU..not US" kind of deal. It's really annoying how EVERYTHING can be covered with "Well, they are children..you have to expect that with children." OK..I asked if children were allowed here when I moved in and was told no...so I moved in...now I live on a fucking playground it seems like. I put forth the effort to ask in advance.  I suppose what this means is I actually should stop being worried that the neighbors won't like me working on cars or painting or whatever...and just do it. They seem unconecrned that their loud music wakes me up every morning at 8...and I work nights. I figure maybe I need to bring things to a head and live exactly like I want to..and when they don;t like it..I'll "Stand up for myself " and bitch and whine like the nutcase women around that everyoine seems to respect sop muc for being bitches...  Maybe I should list life as "My Turn!"

      So I was driving to the police run community center today in Redlands. There is a school zone, with all manner of lights flashing to make one aware that children are present...so I slowed to 20 mph, as I saw no signs that said to go slower. 100 yards later, the fat black woman in the clapped out Toyota behind me began blowing her horn and waving her arms madly...she wanted me to speed up!  Did she not see the signs? How could she miss the huge yellow strips and markings of "SCHOOL ZONE-SLOW" on the road for a few hundred yards? It's a mainly black school..and I do suspect that if I were speeding along, all sorts of hell would be brought to rain down on me..but it's perfectly accpetable for a BLACK woman to become annoyed and aggressive because she couldn't leave in time to observe speed laws.  My response was to immediatly slow down to 7 mph. Made sure she say the brake lights too. there was traffic coming the other way, so there was no way to pass. Had she tried, I would have blown her econobox doors off and not let her past me. Damn it, if I have to get tickets..the hell if anyone else is gonna blow the laws around me! Besides, school zones are there for a REASON..because it sucks when a kid is killed because of a stupid driver.  Last I saw her she was pulled into a left turn lane with about 15 cars in front of her. If she had half a brain she would have gone one more block, made a left, and been faced with a back road without a single car on it.Dumbass bitch.  Once at the center, I found two of the three black teens that caused all sorts of trouble a few weeks ago milling about at the front desk causing trouble. I walked up and gave them a "Fuck you all to hell" look and they immediatly vanished. I simply know they are going to pull something else. You can tell they are fucking assholes. Mommy and Daddy certainly seem to have enough money to drive brand new cars- I don't seem to think they are actually underpriveleged. Sort of like the assholes in "NWA" all those years ago...the TV show going from house to house with them..and ALL of the houses were a damn site better than anything MY parents ever had...and the driveways were filled with cars no more than two years old. Oh yeah "Fight the power" and all that lame ass lying through their teeth shit. If they lay a hand on me I will respond in kind. I don't want to risk re-injury of my neck because some smart ass kid wants to show his ass. They touch me, I'll take them down hard and fast. THEN I have every intention of suing their families for any damages.  I am tired of giving to assholes. If they want to show their asses and be like this, then they don't deserve respect back. I hope to hell nothing happens with this Intro Class so I have reason to close in two months. That's OK, they need another raquetball court to throw basketballs around in and make out in....soon enough they'll have a brand new football field to mess up. I hope to move out of town ASAP. Let this place rot.

      Christ.  I got the ticket in the mail for 75 when an asshole was chasing me. It will cost me 300 dollars. I now have absoultly no resepct left for traffic laws at all. If someone does stupid things to me again, it's war time...and their vehicle or life is part of the bargin if they fuck with me. If THEY can endanger my life, I can return the favor. I'm am tired of getting blamed and the people who caused the problem wandering off scott free. This has been a pattern in my life..the idiot losers with no idea get the promotions, never get the punishment when needed.  For now I'll stop short of the urge to own a pistol and open fire on these idiots...but I am getting rid of two cars with every intention of a scabby old truck that doesn't matter if I hit things in it. Pipe bumpers here I come. Maybe its about time white men declared something instead of being blamed for everything.  I declare if you fuck with me on the highway again I'll put you in a ditch, off the road or into a tree before I get another ticket caused by anyone else.  I hate living in the USA, I don't care what anyone says about it. If,perhaps, I was an illegal alien, then maybe I'd have some rights here. Maybe I can declare myself hispanic or soemthing.  I want out.

      Well, it is all happening yet again. I happen to be an individual by definition, and a group of people want something that takes things away from me. The outright lie about the USA is that individuals matter in the least. What matters is money and nothing else.  So some goofass salesman that made stacks of cash down by the beach is feeling his age and has decided to donate a great deal of money to build a footbal stadium, a soccer field and two baseball fields for the school next door. The city morons over the years have all opposed any form of building, so never set aside zones for growth for anything. It happens the apartments I have lived in for 9 years is right in the gunsights of the planned building project..so ..of course..fuck ME, I'll have to move because they want me to.  First, football, baseball and basketball are all losing steam on the national level, second, its really stupid to build the hopes of teens up that they ever have a snowballs chance in hell of becoming a pro ball player (in a town where 90% of this school is white...) and last..they don't even have money to buy paper for student assignments...what the FUCK do they need ball fields for if they can't even doing the teaching part of their job?  I am searching for a way to move anyway, but it looks like all this will catch me money-short and fuck me under. I expect to raise a public stink about it demanding cash for me having to move.  Probably what will need to happen is a quick sale of a car, a purchase of another with a second car used as a trade-in..only to establish credit for all my problems caused by debt when I broke my neck. No one gave a crap about me then either..as I now find the settlement for that injury should have been between 250,000-500,000 dollars...and I got a stunning 15,000...which was all gone after paying the basic doctor bills...leaving me to charge my credit cards to the limits to survive in the months I was without work.  Most of all, I am sick and tired of being forced to follow every law, be a great person and never get a touch of respect from anyone for it. I should rob banks, rape girls, drive like a fucking moron and attack anyone I want..then I would have established RIGHTs which couldn't be violated.  I am sick of being an "American" and STILL wish to hell I wasn' born here. There is no "American Dream" if you aren't a minority or a criminal. The dream is to work your ass off so those other two groups can whine and take ever more money from you in taxes so they don't ave to pay for anything. Otherwise, why would all the best public parks be in the worst parts of town?  Fuck everyone. In Redlands. When I move I will close the location here with a letter to all major papers (not the rag in tow that promotes all the old money) on the closing as a protest against the town itself.

      ...last night the font size in the browser changed to something so small I could barely read it. Just now, it switched back to some sort of older, bigger and easy to read font. I like this...but can't understand why its doing it...oh well, I care not anyway.  I pulled out an older keyboard than the one that came with the current tower set-up to see if it was any different typing on it. Right off, I found it had a slight dishing out to the set of the keys on the board itself. It seems a whole lot more comfortable than the other one. The other one had all sorts fof bells and whistles and buttons and crap on it...but it was slower overall. Yes, I still fight the dyslexic fits for sure..but seem to be getting less typos. This is the keyboard I pounded out 50,000 words on in 5.5 days last November. I can see why I wasn't getting as much done as of late. It's like a guitar or something- you get used to the neck. Yeah, you can play other guitars, but there is a certain radius and scale length that works best for you always....Also, it seems like my hands hurt a lot less using this one..and my pace is at least twice as fast even with a few mistakes. Anyway- enough technical blissery....     I hate clothing of this century. Men's clothing hasn't really been cool since the 1850's, but that last time a man got to dress like a man was the 1940's. Then came the 50's and all the rock and roll and bluejean bullcrap. Men's clothing lines got softer and softer and I hate it. I have always been much prone to very old clothing or WWII type military cuts of things. In the early 80's I took the sleeves off a Korean War heavy army shirt...stiched on all black buttons and then dyed it black. Like a moron I wore it when I met Bono of U2 that tour..and I swear..like a month later he was wearing his custom made sleeveless black military cut shirt all over the world. It pissed me off because everyone thought I was the one who stole the idea. Mike Peters of The Alarm has a great story about Bono, Dave Sharp's most treasured expensive new hat and a night the newspapers caught "IT" on film.....  I figured that Bono didn't directly steal it..but I am sure that the influence was there in the back of his memory somewhere. Funny...The Alarm was already heading in that direction with all the black cowboy stuff and later black Dickies stuff.  So...I most regret loaning my favorite peice of clothing ever to the bitch who fucked up my life. One night it was cold, and as always, she hadn't brought anything except the shirt she was wearing. I had my always present French Army Issue Field Jacket with me. The REAL field jackets..not these crap things the Air Force is issuing now....so I loaned it to her. I have never seen it since. I asked for it back a number of times to be told "I gave it back to you already!" Yeah...right..I totally wouldn't notice having received back my favorite peice of clothing ever.  So I have been on the hunt for one like it ever since. I have found a few close, but nothing that has that "Zing" to it this one had. It has to have four pockets on the front, epualets on the shoulders, long sleeves, expanding pockets for the lowr..and a belt WITH only two loops on the back...and the ever popular expanding back in a true 1938 style.  I found but one so far- and it's exactly the cut, color and even BUTTONS I want...BUT...it's $300.00...! It now has become a goal, as I find what I actually had was a damned collectable vintage jacket from the 1940's made by a company that supplied many militaries and the public..and they went out of business in the 1980's. Funny, I probably got one of the last original ones. Until then, I have found something that is probably about 85% correct and I plan to get it. I am on the way to losing weight again and once I get to where I was a few months ago before getting so sick..I will take it to my tailor to have it tucked and tapered at the waist..to have a more MALE look to it! I HATE the soft, dumpy, mall=crap feminized clothing they "allow" men now! I am revolting against it..now!  So I have a number of fedoras..and I yanked the fancy iron with the fancy steam setting out of the closet this evening and re-shaped the crush on the crown of one, and reset the brim on the other. This has lead me to a mad plan for winter. I am going to get a pattern I found and then find a sewing machine...I have every intention of making a black field jacket with some extra trim I have seen..around the wrists and the such. Just a few slight changes. Of course, the more I think about it, I'll probably end up with something looking like an Officer's Jacket from Babylon Five! That, however, would be cool by me..I would love it. Anyway, I can't see what the big deal about sewing is. I mean, I have built operating and flying models that had to be covered with japanese tissue paper that you had to apply with twizzers, I have rebuilt all manner of cars and machines...done body work, and can figure out anything that is three dimensional. I am rather tired of hearing how hard sewing is (I used to have a good friend years ago who was a tailor, as was his family..he said it was easy as hell to him after building a hot rod), so once I get the Jeep sold I will buy a really hot sewing machine and dive in. Maybe I'll get a Husquavana...I can't believe they make fancy sewing machines..I like their chain saws..! I saw a computer controlled machine a while back..you program your computer, interface it to the sewing machine, and it changes sticthes, threads...all sorts of things..in mid-stitch. That's not a woman's thing..that's a MACHINE that a MAN must own. I wonder if I can put headers and duals on it...?  Speaking of the coolest clothing on the planet..I saw..IN PERSON..the clothing Sean Connery wore in the first Highlander movie. It was Oh So Cool..and for sale..only $35,000.00! Crap...lottery anyone?  So, I guess I must be feeling healthier if I am THINKING about cool clothing again for the first ime in almost a year. Gotta knock the tonnage back off now. It will happen, it did before....  Oh for a nice Waistcoat and Frock Coat to cover it......knee-high boots....a dress sabre hanging low (hidden knives and psitols..)     Men used to get to look cool! Damn it...! Time for the Revoultion!

      The weird thing is..for some unkonown reason the words just popped into mind one night. The other day I did a Yahoo search on them...and found that it has some vast biblical meaning behind it. Many folks are all twisted up over Pig Slop. How fucking weird is that?  Today I have to eat a decent meal- because whatever I ate yesterday kept me awake all night and feeling sick. I'm none to well right now as a matter of fact. Ick. I was searching the internet for information about the whole West Nile thing and have come to think that maybe my problems starting in October were a case of that. It isn't always fatal it seems...but it's much more widespread than the public is being lead to believe.  Oh well..I wish the headache would go away..I need to solder some tiny wires very soon...then work on the car door....later...world...

      So...the night hasn't been a total waste. I managed to find the missing outlines of some of the novels I have in mind. I also found a Word file of the titles and a blurb for each one. This gave me the ability to see that I need to not only lay out the basic elements such as characters, but also that I need to have the series build as they go..start with a simple plot type and move forward to more complex with each book. One of the things many writers seem to forget is that in between each book people grow older, hopoefully wiser and change. I intend to make each book in each series an increasingly complex type of story line. This doesn't mean it can't be clearly written, it just means I challenege myself more with each one. To just write the same book over and over again just isn't correct. I could name some folks of great acclaim that did just that. I figure they were trapped into it by publishers. My deal will be to have the first novel of each series written before trying any submissions, and the rest of the series already outlined..so all I have to do is write. I wonder if there is a record for finishing books? I remember talking to Martin Caiden (the old dog!) when he had like 85 books done..he said, "What am I going to write NEXT? I have the next SIX DONE already!" Then again, interveiwing WWII vets and typing out their stories isn't nearly as hard as novels...but he did have a fair number of them also come to think of it...I wonder if I can ever afford a real Junkers JU-52?  Part of the writing problem is this keyboard..which is sized weird compared to all my other ones..ever. I need to dig something else out and try it...maybe the spacing will allow me to work better with less errors.    Novel Overveiw:           There are five series of novels waiting to be written, with a total of  at least 16 books that I have at least a basic idea for. Currently, three novels are partly completed in Word, while a fourth is completed in handwriting.  In the  Novel I  series, the novel has a total of 68,590 words done. In the  Historical Fiction  Series, the novel has a total of 62,723 words done. In the  SF  series, the novel has a total of 12,791 words done. The  Handwritten Novel  is guessed to have about 110,000 words total.   Novel I  needs to have the first 50,000 words rewritten to change the point of veiw of the character telling the story and toi increase interaction in the proper fashion between characters.  The  HF  novel needs to be finished in rough draft, and then rewritten to smooth out the annoying problems between characters. I need to settle on the triangles I want to use. I expect it to be a shifting triangle of charcters surrounding the main chacrter...each time changing in each of the main three acts.  The  SF  Novel needs to be outlined before going any farther, to clarify what the hell the intent of the thing is. Pretty pictures of things don't make a novel..that's a travel guide.  The  Handwritten  Novel needs to be entered into Word, the missing notebook reconstructed and then the story line ironed out so it is crisp and shiney. I expect to read it all, then outline it before entering it into the Word format. This shoul make the process better.  Overall, I have the outline of basic ideas to scribble on and put notes on tomorrow. Things like which plot type to use. Once this is set up, I can load stuff into the outlining program and get cracking. That way, if I am not in a writing mood, I can toss ideas into the program and still be making progress.  I wondered  WHY  my mind seemed to be working a touch better and more creatively tonight and just realized...nobody is working on the freeway that's 1/8 of a mile a way!  No explosions, no heavy equipment beeping and grinding and shaking all night long. No flashing lights and beams of insanely bright light spilling out over everything...and no mass of over 1000 idling cars backed up both ways for at least a mile..with grumpy, stupid drivers blowing their horns at each other.  There is actually   AIR   to   BREATHE   tonight..thats not laden with exhaust fumes so think it sets my allergies off. It HAS to be bad for my health to live here...when something as simple as this break makes a profound change in my feeling and output.   OK..sleep seems to be NEXT in the outline of life...tomorrow we work on doors and then words.  Wage Peace!

      So I have read much of the Beats output...traveled to the hallowed grounds they once tramped about on and sat and thought about all of it.  Most of the stories are written in that 1950's pacing I like so much. It worked for Beats, it was great in SF and many others seemed to catch that certain...tempo and cadence back then.  So many get wrapped up in the wild stories from the road. I'm sure there were many never told that topped all that was written anyway. I seem to have far outpaced any of the stories yet read...and...have found....  ...that the novels were written many years after the events upon loving and kind refelction- with the clarity of distance afforded by time passing. I could never write what went down because it just went down...now I look back and can.  I can think of the women I SHOULD have fucked, or loved or married or whatever. I can think of the chances and educations I should have sought and pursued. I can think of the things I should not have done- and there is enough distance to make some sense of them now.  Jack K sat on those early TV shows and people just never got it that he wasn't the hero of the story anymore. That was then..he was now. He was put off a bit too I suppose...everyoine wanting to ask questions about years and years ago...just didn't quite fathom it I suppose. Why should he, he was the first in history to go through this sort of thing?  So one of my problems is losing complete interest in anything that has happened to me thus far in life. Makes it hard to write out novels using things I saw out of context. I suppose, like a confession, I need to get it all down and done on paper anyway.Maybe then my mind will be free enough to move to other forms.  I intend to write a number of formats- not just stick to one. Fiction, Historical Fiction and SF about covers it. Why get pinned down?   I love it when a woman slaps me...I always respond with "Wow...cool..usually I have to pay EXTRA for that...!". It never fails to lock them in their tracks.....now..to find a woman who hasn't slapped me....;<>!  Boy I got home late...oh well..such is life..who am I to question it?

      All day...20 minute segemnts so far. It sucks. Grind, dust off...hit with wax and grease remover..dry for 5 minutes...primer...let dry for 20 minutes...wet sand with 600 grit....let dry for 20 minutes...spot putty...let dry for 20 minutes.....wet sand...let dry for 20 minutes...primer....etc. the whole day has been a set of 20 minute segments.  I hope to get to bed early, so I can awake by 7:00 am and start on things. I am working on actual damage..so it needs to be finished before going on to smaller spot repairs. I want this damn thing painted and clear coated by this time tomorrow.  Oh well...trying to get used to not getting to class an hour early..students don't show until 5 til anyway. I am going to cut back Tuesday and Wed to getting there 15 minutes early instead of half an hour. I can't stand to be late though.....  If possible I will wet sand in the garage tonight to be better prepped for tomorrow morning.  Off to work....

      Considering how much I am moving my feet and how little distance I have covered...the old one step forward and two steps back seems to apply.  The repair on the escort door went bad..very slowly. It was perfect to the point I was surprised at it. Days later it had a bubble appear...I thought in the paint..but sanding revelaed it wasn't a paint issue...it was a bad bond between the bare metal and the body material. 80% stuck just fine, so this is just weird. Maybe it wasn't mixed compltly...who can tell? It's ground off now, I'm waiting to clean the area up an hour to see if anything lifts at the edges. Back to square one for things. I need to finish all the car projects. I don't even care about the minor repeirs on the Miata anymore.  I HATE summer here. Its too damned hot, and all the students vanish on vacation or whatever. Many never come back it seems. I was looking over the last few years of things. I need to get a postcard sent out to counter this habit- but that, of course, requires having money.  Money is in very short supply, having not enough to pay the main locations rent- much less bills after that is paid. I sent a message to everyone to pay for their lessons ASAP...because I am too broke to cover things another slow month. It gets into a speeding ticket, and TWO cars to be smogged in the same month. The cost of keeping the Jeep current knocked the hell out of my finances for sure. Time to sell it to just survive I suppose. Then there are all the benefits of actually having advertising money to spend. In the end I suppose it will put me far ahead anyway.  I sort of have a mental plan to finish the car issues before trying to do any other 9-5 job so I can actually complete things for once. I find that finishing all the damn projects gives me more peice of mind.  OK...back to grinding and sanding and patching stuff.

      Well..the door on the escort has become a Problem, in each attempt to make it better, has, of course, made it worse. that means grind it all down to bare metal and do it again. Oh well. I guess I need the practice?  The repair of the 500 dollar scoring reels doesn't work. The replacement wire is too big and won't move through the roller system..so I'm out 100 bucks for nothing..and very bad timing for that also. Maybe I can rebuild one of the old godawful French devices instead....  The swamp cooler is doing less than nothing today- making it sticky in here instead of cool. Such is life..I got laundry done at least...!  Time to send an e-mail to the  urlLink $@!#%^$  City and cancel the program there. Too much hassle, not any income..too many annoying "Underprivileged Youth". They can have their dump back..but don't ever think of moving to MY neighborhood with that attitude..I'll give them the treatment they have afforded me. What goes around comes around..Instant Karmas gonna get them someday. There is a reason some people stay at the BOTTOM of the heap..they belong there....(oh my their tattoos impress me..what's that one? Your name? How creative! Your gang, oh that's nice..you SHOULD be treated as an equal because you cut class, dropped out of school, got somebody else preggars and now my taxes are paying to raise the child, you've attacked people, abused drugs and generally don't give a fuck about anyone but yourself...!)

      I find as I get older things change. In my youth I'd give anybody my body, and never my heart. Now, I'll withhold the body part until I am sure about the heart. In some galaxies that's known as progress. Fancy That...  Anyway, I've gotten fuck all done all weekend. Oh sure, I worked on the Car and its paint issue, and made decent progress. I read a book..but mostly, I have been watching two seasons of a fine SF TV show I never got to see before. I find it a great show and consider myself a fan now. That, actually..IS progress. I slowed down a little.  I as of late have been looking for the simplest answers to all my problems. You know "I need a place to live"...what's the cheapest immediate answer...Mobile Home..sell a car to get a down payment and move.  "I don't have enough space to live in" - Hmm..there are still like 600 LP's and a rack from a record store to hold them...plus tapes and CD's. Answer ..MP3's. I got a program to record and clean up all the LP's. I'll sell them off as they are mostly collectable ones that are left- and keep only the complete collections and the autographed ones...that'll clear out a LOT of space. Also, I can then get a lot smaller player...as I won't need both a CD player, a tape player and a way to plug in a turntable anymore. All this space savings means a small place becomes a bigger space in the long run. Players seem to be about 100 bucks. I'll wait until I get a bunch of stuff converted before investing in that part.  "Its too hot living here"....well..I was going to spend a few huindred dollars I couldn't afford on an A/C unit..instead..I spent a few hours just shaving the damn hair off my arms, legs and neck...like when I was avidly into bicycling. I feel 30 degrees cooler instantly..and it should help on working outside the rest of the week also! That's CHEAP. I got the idea when realizing that Peacekeepers in a film couldn't take the heat...art becomes life.  Simplcity really is the best idea..go directly at the issue and be done with it. I need to knock the diet back in shape. It's amazing how much just one decent meal last week made me feel better. Funny..I have no desire at all for beer or wine at this point..but crave a hot tea or maybe a coffee. How very funny. Then again, I am sick of the bar enviroment. Its hard whenever you go to meet friends at a pub and they already have a Stout waiting when you walk in. Geez..the image got larger than life it seems.  I need to go to the beach and swim in the salt water fairly soon. Maybe I should do it one day when the rest of the world is at work...like early..so I am like a local. Salt water is good for many ills. I wish I had a pool to swim laps in around here. That needs to be something to look for when I move.  Funny, tonight I find out my place is next on the list to finally get repaired..after I have finally let go the idea of staying here.  I find that when I practice peace, peace surrounds me. This could mean that people remain calmer, or that bad things just don't happen at all. This weekend has been an experiment in peacefulness and has worked well enough. I feel like I got a base line reading on balance again somehow.  Wage Peace

      Well..there's nothing like a good horn section to spice life up..is there? You know Gabriel plays trumpet..after all....  So...a student loaned me a TV series on disc because I had a strong interest in one of the people playing a character in it. I came to a point of wanting to know more about this person not because of their movie work, but because of the rest of the things in their life. Now I find I shouldn't have been avoiding the series after all. The short part is, its well written and well made. Like little else I've seen in years. The long part is- how close this person's character seems to be to the part of the person I stumbled onto and was interested in.  I've met the person a number of times, and become hopelessly toungut-tied in their presence. This has only happened one other time in my LIFE..and that would be when meeting Eric Clapton many years ago. It simply doesn't happen to me...usually, when I get nervous..I talk too much. Now..I say just a little..and NONE of it is what my MIND wants to say. I am completly disconnected from what I intend to express...its maddening.  So..they have a passion for an area of my life I wish I knew more about- but I happen to have stumbled onto something I think would be of life-changing importance to them and have tried to make them aware of it...except for the total lack of comminucation thing I have going on. I have exchanged books that would point them in a certain direction...Findhorn..and now have an increasing draw to get my sorry butt there as soon as I can. The Jeep is named Pan...perhaps releasing Pan to wander with a new owner guides me to his mountains sooner?  I am trying to write a letter to the person I need to express the thoughts to as they may leave the country for good at some point in the near future...so I am trying to swallow my....fear..and act. Life is again teaching me the need for a simplicity of action, a complexity of thought, a saving grace of hope and a creavite desire for the future.  When I was very young, before I discovered music, the only thing that mattered was Space. It was right next door with all the NASA launches, and I still defend and beleive in the need for mankind to explore. I have noticed that there are only two times mankind makes great advances in understanding...war time or times of great exploration. Granted, there is much conflict in the way we have explored thus far, but there is a changing understanding as the world grows closer together.  Today, in Anaheim I explained that I had made a rather long drive to get to the shop I was at and they asked "Where are you from?"..without thinking I gave the BEST answer I ever gave..I simply said, "Earth...". Then I moved on before I could be questioned. I LOVE that thought. I mean, in the end..if giant space goats with tentacles were attacking the planet...EVERYBODY from Earth would be friends...right? Why wait for a war to push us into that understanding?  What, he's going hippy on us again? No...something far more ancient and responsible. Back past Crop Circles and Standing Stones I suspect. Back to something older, deeper and richer in texture. No..there are no words for it yet.  In youth, Space was the dream. Life has been a drifting horror without that dream to look forward to. The governemtn gutted my beloved NASA and caused destruction of so much of what made them great. Now...out in the desert..a couple of modern day Wright Brothers hitch on a knowing smile and toss it out there to see if they can make it work. I saw the first time they did. The next goal is the Ansari X Prize. I will be there to see that step into Space taken also....then...I have a goal.  All the writing, all the working, all the teaching, all the planning...is towards a ride on Spaceship One. First guesses are at a price less than that of a house. If I have to choose a house in my lifetime, or a trip into Space...fuck mowing lawns!  I read so much SF in my youth it was amazing. I remember many things that were expected when I see them happen. Its amazing that a Palm has more computing power than ALL the computers on the first shuttle....god how amazing!!! I seem to have reached aplace where hoping for Space and trying to inspire the kids around me to be a part of making it happen are the most important things to me...Maybe someday the old coach will smile behind the pilot of a Space Craft taking him for a ride...and remember their first stumbling steps as a fencer...and their journey towards themselves.  Yes..more and more ..sopmething of a place. If I can't be the kids in "October Skies", I CAN be the teacher who believed in them! Of course, I am far too stubborn to stop there. Now I really need a few more lifetimes to reach my dreams again.....I need to rage.  Living one step at a time..putting one foot in front of the other..healing on my mind...been a long way....a long way..to the light. (Words stolen but better than my own..!)

      Back to earth for a check in it would seem. Yesterday was a LONG, LONG day. I shuttled back and forth between smog stations and finally the most beloved of all California creations...The Department of Motor Vehicles. The unknown secert aboiut DMV is this: If you join AAA for like 40 bucks a year, you get discounts, towing...and can do all tag and title related stuff at AAA instead of DMV. The folks there are a LOT nicer because nobody gets in their face the way they do at DMV. Now.... DMV could also stand to take a lesson from them about how to run an organization with intelligent and nice people also!  So...finally..the Jeep has been smogged, insured, tagged and is ready to go for another two years. It will need one more smogging EVER...in two years, and then is clear of the system. Still, as much fun as it is to drive around, the clutch has left my left knee in agony, and I seem to be dreaming of something...anything else.  It has felt like a prison sentance trying to get this whole deal wrapped up. Actually, it's been a trial. Had I failed it, I would have been sentanced to a lot of hassle correcting it all. I spent a great deal more money on all this than I had a budget to do. Having two cars come due the same month, needing smog the same years is too much. That in itself is reason enough for some fundimental major change.  Class is thinning yet again, but LOTS of people are on vacation. I guess I'll need to mail something to recover people back into the fold. The next session starts in about 3 weeks..so next week I should send postcards or something. I think I can pull attendence from my excel files now and see how to market to folks. I am bummed..a while bacj somebody's brother broke something at the facility and they made a big deal about it...the kid in class left and never came back because I am sure he was embarrassed over it all.  I hate it when somebdoy else causes a student to quit...its hard enough keeping people as it is.  AND..a student on vacation in Orange County was refered to a group where I know they have quality teaching and organization. Somehow, they stumbled onto a group I thought was gone. This group has a person who claims to have been coaching for like 30 years- has NO pedegodgy at all..and their vast staff of coaches has no training as coaches what so ever. Well..it gets better.  The student's mother, being upset that the local location for her is closing, has given this group the idea that I don't know what I am doing and need help. They now figure on moving into the area and setting up shop because they think it is ripe for picking! Christ...why do people get it all so wrong and then never bother to ask? In addition, this group brings in lots of young kids- they are a playground-NOT a training facility...so this student did well against them. Somehow because they had all these kids it equates to THEM really knowing what they were doing!?!?!?!? NONE of their students even place in local competitions...even their coaches don't fair well. So I may have to get ready for a turf fight. I believe mostly, that no one from their group will make the drive in traffic out here to actually do anything. If I find they are planning to do so then I will level them with pointed questions..and counteract their infleunce with a section on my own website before they get rooted here. If other places open in the are I have given up my free time, marriage and most of my life to build..they need to belong to ME. End of Story. I bring the Shake.  Moving forward, the intial repair on the Escort has gone south for the winter. I got an adhesion problem with the color coat- so it was a goodthing I waited before clear coating..otherwise it would have been even more of a waste...Time tos and it all off and start over again. I know what I did wrong also- I rushed the process and painted over something that probably wasn't cured enough...then, the color dried faster than the stuff below it...casuing a big old bubble to pop up....OPPS Live and Learn...  In the end, the Escort shouldn't take nearly as much to get done as the Jeep has..so I need to knock it out quickly. I'm not going to do Northern this year- why bother? I may GO one day- but not work. Hmm..if I lst weight I could do the Dickens festival at the Palace in SF this year too..I have the clothing..all I need to complete it is a nice percussion cap pistol..maybe a revolver would work...go as a Scot who has moved to the new country of America....I have the perfect sword actually from taht time- not a repro...swords AND guns...that would be cool. Now all I need to find is a young woman to dress wild for the times and play the part of a fallen angel I've taken a shining too....  Hmm..maybe I should lose weight sooner and go to the Exotic Erotic Halloween Ball. I had a freind who went some years ago- and any number of people offered to fuck the hell out of her while there. She was to die for- a Bondage Fairy. I have a picture somewhere. I would have offered too if I was there...;<>! (She has since gained like 50 pounds..it sorta ruins the effect of the fairy costume I expect- oh well, she's getting married now anyway- the third time is supposed to be the charm..I hope it is for her...)  OKOKOKOKOKOKOK  get rolling...need a blast to Anaheim for clear coat I think...see me later!

      I had nightmares, very graphic and violent all night long- or at least in the span where I slept. Sort of end of the world by virus stuff. Then, a woman I know only slightly showed up in the dream to be like a mate or something...not my type at all....so weird. I can't figure what any of it means.  So far today got the jeep back and need to set an appointment for a recheck now the repair work has been done. Guess I need to get to it...

      Imagination is the waking line between dreams and reality. Reality is a thin facade that covers the infinite in a way the knowingmind can not grasp. The sleeping mind, the mind of drugs, the drunken mad mind of Byron, the sickened sad mind of Shelly's Mary reach beyond what is seen and touch what is. Sometimes one can feel what is long enough to pull a taste of it bacl to this world that seems to be.  There was atime when I was laways altered, before I was injured, and my mind spun madly endlessly and I am sick with too many thoughts. I prayed that I would lose this torment and then I did in a tragedy. Now I dread the roaring silence that brews in my head....  But something stirs increasingly ...growing..perhaps madness to some, but to me a taste of the mind once that I had to hold. A place that was not of my own making that I was blessed to veiw and qoute from and make sense of to herion runied whores, little lost angels and runners in the night that sought death but found hope.  I have retreated from the normal world without normal employ yet seem stronger than yet ever. I have a place and it seems to need the space to find me and be....seen.  I dread the coming daylight..and all the noise it brings with it....  Tonight I have had enough chocolate to kill an army.

      Ghosts are supposed to be trapped between life and death with a weight on the side of death. Are there white ghosts trapped on the side of life..still breathing but dead and trying for the transmutation that releases them into whatever will be or not be?  Do those ghosts we see..that I see actually want me to follow them to wherever? Is there a hereafter? I have no idea..but don't believe the christian pissings of a final revenge of an angry god against a mere mortal as I.  No..the other great religons have it more right...from the hot breath of Islam and its whirling and dervish understanding of the circle of life, to the hot temples of some Asian land wet with humidity, mildew, life and sex.  Christians believe in ruling the world we see..and submitting to the ones we don't as if they are all a great evil. I doubt this is so. Because...I have demanded answers of unseen gods and received them.  In all this I still feel like I am lost in time away from a century ago when I would have been fitted for the times. How I wish I had traveled with Burton and Speck through their trials....into glory...into knowledge...Darwin and The Beagle..abiding and respecting Fitzroy....or maybe as late with Carter and his amazing dig to the tombs. When you light a candle in the grave of a pharoh does it illuminate the way...or destroy the guidence that was actually there...?  1988 my most dear friend and confidant of youth, Tina was killed in a car wreck..the last thing we shared on this earth was my seeing her as the last of her friends before the coffin was locked tight...just after I slipped in the only token I could think of to show how much I still loved her and always would...a guitar pick...she, of all understood.  I felt something as we carried her to her grave, a brushing by or feeling I can't explain..hiding behind my long hair and fighting the tears she deserved the whole world see. Why couldn't I cry as I wanted to...let everyone know I had loved her so very much? Because her husband was there? Because I wished she had married me and never met this wreck on a bad road in Georgia..or because the gods would have played as cruel a trick on her if she ended up with me anyway? No..for I have found the one sure way to prolong a Bohdi's visit to this earth is to have a child borne by them. Then they have yet more to learn and must stay. Thank god for Annie's little Quiron....But alas, Tina had no child and was fast leaving this , this...plane? Was it her brushing by? Probably. I remember staring at her face..I still love her image so....and seeing the brusing covered with makeup to concel her death. My dear Tina...and knowing she had lived long enough to actually bruise. Did anyone else realize this? Oh the pain of that moment- and the burning question as to what EXACTLY is it that dwells in the human or any other body...which in can be knocked out with a hard blow so that the body lives no more?  And I got my answer some 2 weeks later in a rendering explosion of metal and glass smashing the person I used to be surely to death as its never come back. I know what it is that leaves. Words can't be spoken for a powerful feeling. But its been years that I have been trapped here..in between. Sometimes seeming all the world alive..sometimes a ghost of something that was all wrapped up into one.  I miss Kevin so. I feel him around me at all times...like now, whne the traffic is gone, the lights out around the area and its quiet enough to feel him here. I tried to say goodbye to all them to not trap them here by my pain of losing them. I lit candles and burned them all evening...each one was a friend..Kevin, Tina...Steve. I thought, in the morning I had let them go...but there is more- something primordal and ancient that still is here. I am not scared by it anymore- I accept it. Somehow. If I am to feel it, then its meant to be.  Tonight I wonder if it is myself who is trapped..and that THEY are trying to HELP me reach wherever they are. I'm not in the mind of suicide. I am in the mind of wonderment at the way it all works. Just how have I made it so long..or have I?  I always swore to myself I'd be dead by 27 for some reason. I wasn't..but my wreck was when I was 28..and it took some long years to understand that I had died..for I was not as I had ever been.  If one can call them angels..do they have trouble getting used to the change? Is THAT a ghost? Final retribution in hell..I think not.....it doesn't fit the way the material world flows around itself like water over rocks in a stream. Hell stops you in your tracks...even mountains melt in time.  What am I trying to say..I don't know. I just need to say it. It is what keeps me awake until all hours of the night- this...feeling ...of knowing....more. I am scared to death to go to Findhorn. I am scared to death to sell my jeep and have the money to go there...but it seems like a great wooden door hiding the rst of my understanding from me until I walk through it. Haunted when the minutes drag...  Perhaps its not even Findhorn itself..its something about getting there...I don't know. Late at night when faries dance and spirits take to wing... the harsh wind blows the moss about as gators start to sing.....the bullfrogs all have bedded down as crickets loudly sing..and kneeling low I touch the earth.... the soul of mother earth...its just another decade lost I tell the midnight sky...late at night.....  where did that song go......can I sing it or will beseeching it bring some of this change...?  Am I the one who is Trapped? I still don't know...

      So..the jeep went for it's much vaulted smog testing today...and failed as I expected...I believe it is the carb I put on a year ago. The biggest problem is its running rich at highway speeds..which means they gave me the wrong carb as its jetted too rich...GGRREEAAATTT....I have to PAY somebody to fix it to prove I had it fixed. SCAM!  So its was a long ass day dealing with all the stuff on this issue..plus teaching.  Sadly, one of my students has a problem paying and was gonna have to quit. I need every penny I make..so..I bartered...! Now..I will have a series of radio ads on a small radio station in the area! I rock! I have to write a script now and practice the acting.... . Class went well tonight, with the students being driven into a frenzy while fencing to the likes of Jet, Julian Cope and PuffyAmiYumi....I love pulling this out on them..they don't know what to do...but they are exhausted at the end of the evening. You know, teaching is just like making mad love to a stunning woman..if they are exhausted at the end of a night ..they are happy. Man, what a fuck I am....(dumb, stupid, silly, goofy, loud..etc..).  Well...there is nobody to go with me to see rockets (Large and Dangerous Rocketships...) on the 14th and I am bumming....its so cool to be able to see them..its hard to find a group a third this size anywhere else in the US...I think everybody hates me. Why does no one want to drive out to the middle of fuck all nowhere and see giant fucking rockets being launched? I mean, some even blow up if that's your gig...I will go anyway. Maybe I am already becoming a rocket geek since no one likes me.....maybe this is the initiation or something...oh well.I still play better guitar than most of them I imagine....  What else..I may have a chance at some great advertising for 150 bucks..I have to see where the bucks stand tomorrow..I don't think I can afford it....maybe more reason to sell the jeep? Probably sell it, the ads go nuts..and I would have made enough to keep it. Oh well, the Miata would look good with the competition rollbar in it. And I could totally Rice the Escort...big wing on the back- grind off half the paint and primer it..put "Eibach" stickers all over it...no..wait..I LIKE the Escort....  Guess we'll see where life goes won't we?  "The drummer thinks that he is all the rage....if you can't rock me...somebody will....if you can't rock me...."

      Which is yet another reason to not believe TOO strongly in this god fellow. I mean, his followers are off dashing about folding, spindling and mutalating the heathen unbelievers over....there..  So it's rather obvious he's just out to fuck with everyone, because he hasn't created anything worth a fuck since the dawn of time. ..so he wants to pick on people and keep them distracted until he figures out something that will really impress us like adding gills to all human babies for no reason, or maybe allowing Lance whateverhisnameis from the wanker boy band whoyamacallit go into space so he can find a GIANT monolith and then freak out when he flies over the end of it and tell the world "It's full of STARS!".....which will freak out all the people that own an IBM 8000 or something...  ...speaking of which..ever notice the name of the computer in "2001" is the "HAL 9000"? Yeah..shift those letters by just ONE PLACE and it's "IBM!!!!!" Damn! We're all doomed to live on the set of a place that looks like IKEA took over! Which, by the way, would be perfectly fucking fine with me as long as the women wore short skirts and those Go-Go Boots everywhere.  So I was the kid that read EVERY BOOK in the children's section of the local public library by the time I got out of 6th grade. I mean it. I read what I liked, then I just started at one side and read the rest as I came across them. It was Orlando, and its a big fucking kid's section. I had no idea what to do next, so I discovered microfiche and annoyed the hell out the librarians asking for fiche so I could keep up with the reading of reports for WWII submarines and the dawn of flight and maybe shit about Marconi or Tesla or something....until they told me to get into something else...so I found the "Fine Arts" section and began to check out books on antique dressors and stuff. that ruled. No other 7th grader had a clue when they invented machine made screws..but I DID! (I forgot now though..but I can tell a handmade screw when I see one...which...at one point, rather got me in trouble at The Getty for getting too close to a certain valuable peice of fluff..but the security guard dug the reason I was looking too..and we both got caught on our knees staring underneath this fine relic...so it was worth it).  So..when the Internet was invented, it was simply to curse ME, because I believe I have to visit every site on it before I can stop. I can't remember what it was like having time to do things in the evening anymore..like walks, bike rides, chasing women, drinking, street racing...damn..what the HELL am I doing?  BUT..I DO know the benefits of building a Jet Engine out of an old turbocharger so as to cool your beer faster and have a reason to use your shed in Australia. I DO know who makes the smallest gas powered turbine engine in production (Wren in England...). I DO know the exact time of the Atomic Clock in Boulder, Colorado without reaching for my Shortwave Radio...I do  know  a lot of things....  Like..."Whatever happened to Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction"? Or maybe what are the on-going adventures of "The Arch-Druid Julian Cope"? I even found out what's going on with "Dumpy's Rusty Nuts"...!  Hmm..that reminds me.....What was the name of that hot chick that played "Holly" in the original "Land of the Lost"? She was such a babe....I gotta go....I think I hear a Sleestack....

      So, anyway, enough whining. What I really can't explain is why I have had songs from the almighty Hanoi Rocks just pounding in my head for about two months. What a great band they were..I am still bummed out and annoyed that they didn't try and get a new drummer after Razzle was killed (FUCK Vince Neil FOREVER for killing Raz...no forgiveness....he didn't even get serious jail time!).  I played a couple of live things I found on disc, but need "Two Steps from the Move" on disc..the production was amazing as were the songs. I did get the new studio one of the reformed group, it's pretty good. I need to hear it again..tried to listen to it in the car on the way to Comic Con but the friend my buddy picked up started in about "All those crappy hair bands from the 80's that he never got into.." Funny words for someone in their late 30's who has probably never had a date, lives with like 3 other guys that are the same age and have focus on the things 14 year olds do...gaming, computers, etc. Guess he didn't know what a hair band was anyway..because the Rocks certainly were NOT just a show- they were a fuck of a band.  Yes, The Hanoi Rocks were a great band. The four most amazing bands of the 1980's were The Alarm, Marillion, The Hanoi Rocks and The Rainmakers. Each band was great on recorded output, amazing live and never got their proper respect or recognition, The Alarm beat the path every "Alt acoustic rocker" band followed..even taught U2 how to play "Maggie's Farm" ( which they did at LiveAid and the whole world freaked out over it...). Marillion just never got noticed....that is a sin. The Rocks started to make it in the USA until that fuck of a loser from Motley Crap, Vince Neil murdered their drummer in a drunk driving accident. (How many people are aware it was VN's second drunk driving wreck with injuries, Raz was killed, the other passenger was badly hurt and a woman in one of the other cars he hit was nearly paralyzed..? For this he got like 15 days and 300 hours of public service..must be nice to have the record company BUY YOUR WAY OUT OF RESPONSIBILITY.) As for The Rainmakers..every fucking so-called "Alternative Rocker" owes their living to them directly.  BUT..Rap (so-called) music came along and the focus on rock went away immediately. Was it because Rap was better or cooler? Hell no..it was because MTV bought into the disposable music scam that Berry Gordy invented with Motown Records. Nobody remembers the class action lawsuit against him for unpaid royalties by like 90% of the people that were ever on his label..even his own SON sued him.  It's simple..get songwriters on board writing for a flat fee. Find people wth an avearge amount of talent, toss them a great tune with great production and promote the hell out of it. Then send them out to tour until they run into utter exhaustion and get a drug/ drinking habit. By then, the next sucker is recording..so you let the first one fail or gice them crap for the next album and then drop them. Before they ever figure out the business they are in they are gone. It worked like a charm for him, it works even better for Rappers. Why do you think only a tiny percentage of rap ever has a SECOND big hit record? Because they are getting used by the people they put their trust in is why....  I had a very enlighteneing conversation with a very famous singer in a very famous heavy Metal band a few years ago. He had a reason to spend a lot of time at MTV a number of years ago, and overheard two exec's talking on and on about how rap was the next big thing, and that they were getting rid of all the Metal and Rock to make room. he finally got annoyed at them and told them Metal wouldn't die that easy...etc. A year later, his major, major band couldn't get a vid on MTV for any amount of trying..and gigs dried up as younger people all went over to the rap that was flooding ther airwaves. Since then, through personal marketing this band has rebuilt a solid business and tours all on their own..while 99% of their buddies have vanished to work at Marks and Sparks or someplace.  The truth is, MOST people in the USA blindly follow whatever is fed to them..be it music, fashion, sports or going to war. They just don't think for themselves. Well, damn it, if everybody else is making money of this blind worship then I should as well.  Once again, FUCK Vince Neil...he deserves whatever evil befalls him.

      Yes..It's ON! Scaled Composites has made it official, the dates for the launch of Spaceship One to win the X Prize are Sept 29, 2004 and Oct 4, 2004...which happens to be the 47th anniversary of Sputnik!  I was at the launch when they made it to claim the prize as the first civilian astronaut in space..I have to be part of this also.....I am SO THERE!  Funny, "October Skies" was on last weekend on TV and I saw it. I miss the way NASA was before the reagan government screwed it under. People can say what they want to about my comment..I lived in Florida and 60% of my friends had immedaite family at KSC. I tried to get hired there when I got my degree in Computer Electronis...but nobody was hiring as reagan had cut the budget so badly...the bastard. So unless you lived within 80 miles of KSC..your comments to the negitive don't matter..because YOU didn't LIVE it.  Now..to see if I can inspire any of the teens from the fencing group into going....  Details as they come out are on the website for Scaled Composites at  urlLink www.scaled.com  .     The sky is no longer the limit!

      Spent so far today working on the door damage on the car. Got most of the actual bodywork done yesterday..but as ever I am having issues with pinholes in the primer and a couple of spots that are just being a bitch in general. I seem to have worked them out by filling, sanding and primering with different types of supplies. I beleive the main problem is the lack of a pro facility to work in with all the toys and tools they have to work with. I can do the work, it just takes longer.  I've just shot the color coat and figure to give it two days drying time before wetsanding it. I know the label says I can do it now..in 20 minutes..but I found better results when it has a couple of days. I intend to shot 3 color coats to give good, even coverage and probably at least 4 clear coats to ensure as shiney a finish as the rest of the car.  The front bumper has one crack in it from hitting a dog on the way to a fencing competition years ago. I believe it shouldn't be as much of an issue to patch as the door..as the door was cruched and rippled and metal. The bumper is plastic..grind it away and fill it in with kitty hair...sand it to shape. I should have enough color paint to do all the details I need to do. I do need another can od clear though. Once I get the bills paid and some income from this monet maybe I can just run to Coast AB and pick up supplies there. In all, the painting part is the easiest part- the bodywork is the bitch. I look forward to finishing the repair projects so I am free to experiment on skulls and other figures on things. I am starting to get the hang of using the airbrush. I might even be able to do a Roger Dean inspired logo of my own...for a display item at the main location. I think if I can get it as nice as I want they'll put it up for sure.   Life seems somewhat balanced..yes, bills are lacking and there are a couple of things hanging like that famous fellow's sword over my head- but that's OK. Tomorrow I need to get active on the smog cert for the Jeep. That buys a lot of time once done...and some relaxation overall.  I can't work on the rest of the car for a few days, so it's back inside tomorrow to work on business stuff like testing and time permitting get into the novel yet again. I figure one 7 day week, 8 hours  a day would complete the rough draft of it. THEN..I need to do a seriuos outline to be ready for Nanowrimo in November...I can work the SF novel in the meantime. So..finish last year's NaNo novel, fill the space until Novemeber with the SF novel- and if I finish that pull the first one out and do the data entry and rebuilding for the stolen notebook for it. There is a possiblity of having three novels done by December at this point. If so, THEN I can shop an agent and a publisher. I find so many authors DON'T actually work on their job of writing, I want to show a back log of completed work to potential publishers. I also want to surprise them in my willingness to get the editing done and the work complete ASAP. Why should it be any different from any other job? I'm not pissy enough to be a whining little artist type..that's too much self-importance and not enough balls to get the job done.  I need coffee, hot tea and Boba Tea very soon...(not at the same time mind you..just over the next few days..)  Rock on..

      So..I handled the Tax dealy this morning and say the thing that caused all the problems in its current;y fatted and disgusting shape last night..I have moved on as of this morning.   I have just received word that the woman I was transferred under in my 9-5 (which I quit last week..) has stepped down from her manager position, and the little group I am in has been transfered to someone else..who...rumor has it, is the top seller in the area. My friend and manager will go check it out sometime this week. He's going to push again on the big account I lined up a year and a half ago that hasn't been closed yet. I was under the impression it was being "Saved" for the woman who quit.  So much for her anyway. A goodie two shoes woman with like 4 kids..by 4 men, and she was only like 28 or something. THEN, of course, she found a rich guy twice her age and with a ton of money...who was all into god..so now she is too. She lied flat out to us about being on appointments, when she was giving church birthday parties, skipping days and doing all sorts of things. Yet this is the woman who was writing bad reports on people like me when a car broke down on the way to work and we'd spend all night fixing it to get there the next day. FUCK HER!  I wonder what will happen next...?!?!?!/

      Drove to Riverside to the State Tax Board. It took all of 20 minutes to cancel the permit that showed up under my name for no good reason. Its been years- what was so hard about that for my ex-partner? She truely is a self-centered, selfish little...er big flake of monumental porportions.  It is interesting, I seem to be the white person in the State that is in business. Everyone working there and waiting was Mexican. What can that mean?

      in my KNEE! Geez! Woke up..or should I say..failed to sleep because my left knee began to hurt like hell last night. This would be a result of fencing on Friday. I am getting closer to considering my competitive days as a thing of the past..I can't deal with this kind of pain much longer- esp if I don't have to...guess I shoulda kept up on the Glucosumne and MSM..opps...   Off to resolve the state tax issue this morning with a big old southern grin. That gets farther than threats.....we'll see at least...

      WOW...sometimes timing is everything. Well, timing and razor fast reactions such as mine. I was on the huint just moments ago, for meat and food for the tribe when suddenly...    Actually, I was at the store buying bread when I almost walked down an aisle. There was this short but HUGE woman in about her mid 50's reaching for something on a shelf. She was buck ugly in a "Let yourself go sugar, you're white trash and should be proud of it..." sort of fashion. The clothing hung loosely off the short but undulating body. Funny thing that...loose clothing DOESN'T hid the fact someone is grossly out of shape...   Then, in an instant, I realized..it was my ex-business partner that fucked me under so badly! OH MY GOD! What a wreck! What a PIG! There is no way she can make the normal fat girl claim of "I have big bones.." as she didn't used to look like that. Her hair looked like crap, was too bushy and colored for the roundness of her fat face. Besides honey, that style went out in about 1987!    How fat do I mean...well..she is as wide as a shopping cart..and nearly 5'4" tall. That should paint a ...well...ickers...picture! Yes, I put my dick in her years and years ago, but I don't know how she still has sex at this point, and by the looks of her expression don't think she really does. It was so disgusting. So VERY disgusting..no one should ever let themselves go like that.    So, I made my way through the express line by dropping a cuple of things off to cut my count..I DID pick up a huge peice of chocoalte cake which I have now wolfed down...for god sakes I look GREAT! I DESERVE to splurge. I am thinking the incredibly fat begger I ignored on the way out was her HUSBAND!!!!!!  Thank you Universe, I needed a boost and a laugh. I have WORK to do, a life to lead and a whole world to save....! We March!

      Went to the mailbox. It never has anything but junk mail and bills anyway- so why bother staying current. Got a form from the "State Board of Equalization" looking for payment of taxes from the company my ex partner embezzeled from, stole from, ignored, left and I closed officialy the instant she said she quit. Funny, there was a sticker over her name with my home address on it and my name...how did this happen? I would guess SHE doesn't want to pay back taxes and is trying to pin it on me. I wish she and her husband and their families were quite simply dead. Drunks, whiners, losers and theives all from what I can tell. A waste of human space and resources.  Seems she wanted to sell equipment. I kind of entertained the idea, but she was all into it. HOWEVER, in six years she couldn't bring herself to show me ANY of the accounting..I never took an order for products or equipment, believe she did, have no idea if anyone paid for them or who her source was. Last I saw when I checked the permit was listed on-line in HER name..not mine..as it should be. I had come to the conclusion she was still suppling her buddies with stuff and blowing off the state. Seeing how she doesn't return any calls or anything..who can tell?  Monday I will call the board and explain to them that as far as I know, the taxes WERE paid the last year as a business together, and I have had no farher dealings with her since. Time to throw it back in HER lap.  I have decided to not follow any news about the so-called "war" or the election. I already know this country is a diaster, and don't need any more negitive stuff in my own life. I went through the blogs I had bookmarked and deleated all the negitive ones I was following. You know, 350 pound guys whining about why their wife hates them, angry ones about politics..all that. I have retained those of passion and value..and, of course, poetry...as something of great importance to me.  This tax thing seals it. I need to move OUT of this town so the bitch from hell can't find me.  She is pure evil and I don't want to be within 30 miles of her for any reason...ever again. Funny, I think I finished the Jeep tonight..I may have some tune-up stuff..but as far as all the work..it looks done. It took this long to right all the wrongs she caused with this vehicle when I loaned it to her for a few short months. Fuck her all to hell..in a redneck kinda way...!
