      Going to Hell. SOMEONE is ALWAYS bound for Hell, and lately apparently I am the one! Now anyone that knows me, or see's my website, knows that I am obviously into and curious about the paranormal. It has been a passion of mine for almost a decade. It likely shall remain that for the duration of my journey on this earth. It is not only an enjoyment, but a source of relaxation for me. Ok, and it MIGHT slightly border on an obsession. Now I really dont care that there are skeptics out there that think I am a bit odd. So what? Who cares? That is their choice, much as this is mine. I accept that they are closed minded, they should accept that I am not. What I do mind however, is being told that by "chasing" spirits, by seeking to prove that ghosts exist, by delving deeper into this "unknown realm" in an effort to understand it, I am in fact dooming my soul for Hell! Just who do these self righteous folks think they are??  Most of whom, by the way, claim to be fine upstanding Christians! I wish to remind them first and foremost that according to the Bible, GOD is a spirit as well! (John 4:24 states: "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.") Do these christians NOT seek a spirit as well then? HHHMMMMMM............... Let me also remind them of the biblical passage on passing judgement: Matthew 7:1 "Judge not, that ye be not judged." In other words people, sweep around your own front door before telling me how dirty mine is! I also wish to ask them WHY are you telling me what a christian you are? Who are you trying to convince? It has always been my belief that a TRUE christian does not need to profess their christianity constantly to other people. I should KNOW if you are a christian by the way you lead your life, by how you speak with and treat others, by your ACTIONS, NOT by your STATEMENTS, your mere words, rattled off in an effort of......???? what? My convincing, your convincing, or God's? But seeing as the almighty word of mouth is SO important to these people, let me tell them further, that YES! I do consider myself a Christian. Not because I go to church everytime the doors are open, - I do not -  not because I run around constantly telling others I am, - I do not -  not because a preacher tells me I must be, but because of MY PERSONAL relationship with GOD! I do not wish to impress people, my relationship with God is to praise and worship HIM! It is my own and it is no better or worse than theirs! It is personal, and frankly, I feel is NO ONE elses business. I need no one else to be a christian. Do I think I am going to Hell based on the fact that I chase after knowledge of the spirit world? UH...........NO! Am I blaspheming God by doing this? UH........NO! Am I hurting my brethren with this? UH..........NO! Am I out in cemeteries practicing the Black Arts or worshipping Satan? UH......NO! So please, one more time, what exactly is my sin, that God cannot or will not forgive in this??????? My suggestion to all those who fear I am damned to hell by being a paranormal investigator: STAY AWAY FROM ME! If I am such the heathen, then simply do not grace me with your unkind prescence or your unkind words! After all, you wouldnt want to accidentally slip and follow me!
