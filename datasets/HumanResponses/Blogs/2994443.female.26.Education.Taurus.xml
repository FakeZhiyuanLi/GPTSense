       You know, the one where I am at work all day on my own and no one to serve. I've done some work this morning to make up for the fact that I will in all probability not find the motivation to do any this afternoon.     &nbsp;   I don't understand how I can go for most of the day without interacting with anyone, and then when I go off to do some photocopying the phone starts ringing and the toner runs out on the copier at the same time. So I leave the photocopier half refilled with toner, with black crap all over my hands to run and answer the phone, and it has to be a bloody enquiry from an external organisation that I don't know the answer to, doesn't it? And on top of that I am out of breath from running and I sound like an incompetent idiot. So why did that need to happen? And why, when we finally decide to dispose of some dusty smelly old tomes in the library, does someone come in and ask to see them the very next week - everytime, without fail that happens. You can't tell me that is just chance.     &nbsp;   I was talking to Graham about fate and coincidence the other week. His motto in life used to be "everything happens for a reason" but now he doesn't really believe that anymore. Up to a certain point I believe it. I think that the major events in our life are fated, but that the choices we make on our way there are our own free-will. I think that we are all put on this planet for some sort of purpose, that we're all part of some mega cosmic plan. The part we play may seem totally insignificant to us and we may never know that we've accomplished it. If there are only few major events in your life - birth, death, meeting of major players in accomplishing the set task and the set task itself - then there is an infinite amount of choice of what we do with the rest of our years, days and hours on earth. Well maybe not infinite, but enough choice to seem infinite - as infinite is just a concept anyway.     &nbsp;   This is why I don't worry too much about the way my life is panning out. I just follow the path that seems right to my instincts and wait for things to happen to show me whether or not it was the right choice. I figure that fate will eventually take care of the big things in life, so long as I don't sit there passively waiting for it to happen, so long as I am following one course or another. Occasionally I get a calling from myself, saying that it's about time I did something - and when I'm set on what that something&nbsp; is then it usually plays into my hands by way of a lucky set of circumstances or coincidence - maybe not straight away, but eventually the situation I want to be in is made a reality and sometimes without me consciously trying.     &nbsp;   Like I wanted to go travelling so I did. I fell in love with Canada. I came back and had changed my views on my life and friends in Cheltenham and wanted a way out. I also wanted to meet new people and I craved the intamacy of a relationship that I hadn't had for so many years. I advertised for a date. It was answered by Graham who happened to live in Bristol,&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;places in the UK&nbsp;where I thought I might want to live, and who happened to love Canada too. We met, we fell in love. I needed&nbsp;a job and wanted to work in a library. A vacancy came up at Bristol Uni, I got not that job but a part time job in a different uni library - by all accounts a better library for my personal needs as regards the people who worked there and the working atmosphere. That led to a full time job in this library very quickly, which then quickly led on to a promotion (I am the youngest ever branch supervisor, and it is probably due to the fact that no one else applied for this position, when normally there are hundreds of applicants per job). I moved in with Graham. Meanwhile, after a brief flirtation with the idea of going to the US, Graham and I decided that we wanted to go to Canada to live. We couldn't apply as we didn't have enough points. We&nbsp;went to Vancouver, Graham fell in love with it, we got back, 5 months later the passmark goes down and we can apply.     &nbsp;   At the moment the main thing calling me is Canada. In some way it lies in my future and I am yet to know why, but I don't question it - I will find out when I get there. My library work has served its purpose - I no longer want to do it, and when I move I doubt I will continue it, but it got me to Bristol and therefore got me to Graham. And I didn't know it at the time but being with Graham has made going to Canada possible. I believe that what happens in Canada will be related to a major event in my life - it might be my big task, or it might be my death, or both and Graham is&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;major players in my life, clearing the way.     &nbsp;   All this because I refuse to believe that free-will doesn't exist, and I refuse to believe that coincidences happen for no reason. I think that the little coincidences like the&nbsp;old dusty books being disposed of then asked for are fairly meaningless - just fate's little way of reminding us that it is still in control of the world and that we shouldn't get too complacent, shouldn't slip into a way of life that is unquestioning and unaware of the world around us.     &nbsp;   End of discourse.

         If you were born with     3&nbsp;arms   and they were all normal sized and developed, would you       a) have the third arm removed to make you look normal     b) keep the third&nbsp;arm as it would give you something to talk about    c) keep the third&nbsp;arm as it might come in useful, e.g. for sports    d) remove the third arm but keep it preserved and use it as a back scratcher?     &nbsp;   I think I might be tempted by option c, but would probably go for d.     &nbsp;

      They've made it easier to do everything that I want to do with my blog, even just the simple things like  changing   style  and    colour   and      quoting things        and making     lists    both     numbered      and bullet    point.     I like this so much better than my other blog, more versatile.     &nbsp;   Actually, it is possible that my old blog has all these features and I just haven't realised.    It's even got a spell check!    But I am the spelling queen so I won't need it. Probably.    my mum will be loving this...    urlLink  http://kateykinz.blogspot.com   &nbsp;- that's my other site.&nbsp;     I'm going to try and upload a picture now....hold on....    Can't do it from my pc&nbsp;files,&nbsp;can only put in images that are already online. Bugger.     I'm going to do some work now as it is nearly lunchtime and I am leaving at 4 to go to Cheltenham so I really should get some stuff done whilst I can, otherwise I'll be  heaven forbid  overloaded with work tomorrow. Haha, that's a laugh. But my colleagues will think I am the laziest arse on the planet, and that would never do.

       I'm just experimenting.    All these new blog options are great but I wasn't expecting them and now they've thrown me off course. Hey well, I can have fun learning. I'm fed up of writing a diary, and I haven't written it in a week and a half now anyway - it's just not creative enough. I need to be more random, so I can be the strange cookie that people seem to think I am anyway.   People think I'm weird but I don't think I'm too far off normal. When I challenge them to tell me what is so different about me, nobody can seem to put their finger on it, they just say I'm too random and I say funny things. Isn't that normal though?   Anyhow, the purpose of the title of this post is just that I am feeling more drawn to my old skool chums these days and pulling further apart from those more recent. When I say recent, I mean those since the age of 17/18 which isn't recent at all but more recent than the old skool chums - we're talking primary and secondary school-era here. I chatted to Kel for ages last night on the phone, and I'm seeing Liz tonight when I grace 'nam with my presence for an hour or so. I hardly see or hear from them these days and it's so nice to catch up. We three used to hang out between the ages of 10 and 15 and did all the growing-up things together before going our separate ways. Then i'm hankering after seeing Alex and Clare - my secondary school buddies - the ones who I shared the process of becoming adult with, the real scary stuff and the real life-changing stuff.

       Mixed bag  Well, apart from me getting in a mood with Graham on Friday night the weekend went off without a hitch. We didn't really care that England lost the rugby as they deserved it, and we didn't get drunk either. We did have 2 nice meals out though - I think I'll have to accept that my heavy drinking days are well and truly over and that I prefer a more sedate evening out.  Was nice to see my gran on Sunday as I haven't seen her for a while. She wasn't well though and didn't stay long - she even turned up late as the clocks had gone forward an hour and she hadn't realised. Went for a walk around the nice parts of Cheltenham to remind me how much I like it. I would really love to have a flat on Lypiatt Terrace - I've always fantasised about living there. Went to see my brother quickly, who took me out for a spin in his new BMW M3 which was so powerful it made me feel a bit sick!  It's the last time I'll see any of my family for a while. Mum and Dad are off to Australia next week for 6 weeks and I never really see Neil or my Gran unless I go to see Mum and Dad.  Monday was a horrible day - full of depressing news and my own ill health so I don't want to talk about that. The only good thing that happened was that Graham managed to fix the switch on our shower so it will no longer try to catch fire and burn the flat down.  Tuesday was nondescript to say the least and I continued being ill in different ways to Monday, so went to bed as soon as I got home from work.   It's nice and sunny and warm today - soothing my soul a bit.  Our plans for the Easter weekend are still up in the air. All I know is that we're staying in a hotel in Bloomsbury for the night on Good Friday and going to Alex's bar launch night. We're supposed to be meeting with Graham's friends as well that day, but nobody can decide when and where and what to do! I'm hoping that on Easter Sunday or Monday we are going to meet up with a family from Bristol who have been through the immigration process and who have just received their permanent resident visas to move to Canada. They are leaving for Toronto sometime this summer so it'll be good to pick their brains before they go.  Hungry, need lunch.

       Solitude  It's a mad world.  Have had a bizarre day. Been on my own for most of it, just chilling out as there's been no work to do and hardly anyone around to bother me. I didn't have my lunch break until 2.15 when Richard got here, but had been snacking on olives and coffee all morning, whilst filling out immigration forms and the like and looking for a hotel to stay in in London on Good Friday. At 1.30 some member of Chemistry staff came in and asked if I'd like to fill up a plate with some leftover buffet food from the conference they'd just had - how could I turn that down? It wasn't very nice but for free food I guess it was OK.  I've actually quite enjoyed myself today - kind of like having a day off whilst still being at work!  Another weekend beckons - should be an enjoyable and fairly relaxing one. Rugby, drinks and takeaway all day tomorrow, mum and dad's for Sunday lunch and an Easter chat with my Nan.

       Bookworm and the grumpy cat  I did the banking at work yesterday and took our little load of cash up to the bank. Unfortunately, Waterstones is just next door to the bank and before I knew it the shop had pulled me in and I was standing in the fiction section. I thought  I'll just have a look at that book I am thinking about buying on Friday (payday) . The book turns out to have only recently been released in hardback and as I don't want to spend £17 on a book then I decide against it. At that point I should have walked out of the shop but nooooooooo, I can't do that can I? There's a 3 for 2 offer on and after about 10 minutes I find myself holding 4 books - damn. I asked the friendly member of Waterstones staff to help me choose, but he hasn't read any of them, but says that there wasn't one there that he wouldn't recommend. In the end I decided to go for tragedy over comedy, choosing  urlLink The Lovely Bones ,  urlLink The Wind Up Bird Chronicle  and  urlLink Girlfriend In A Coma  and leaving behind  urlLink The Eyre Affair  for another time.  The ginger cat was grumpy yesterday and didn't come to see me, but seeing as it was cold, windy and about to rain I don't really blame her for staying miserably huddled up in the porch waiting for her owner to come home.  I had a very strange combination for dinner last night as I couldn't decide what to have. Ended up with ham and eggs with a side of curried chickpeas! I really wanted bacon but it had gone off.  Graham has the day off today so he's having a boy's day out with his brother and friend. They'll probably end up playing computer games all day like they did last time - obsessed, that's what they are. Liz and Kel were supposed to be coming to Bristol to see me this evening but they've now put it off until April, which is a shame as I haven't seen them since way before Christmas and was looking forward to a girly gossipy night out.  We were meant to go out on Saturday to drink and watch the crucial England-France Six Nations rugby match, but now all of Graham's workmates have pulled out as they are broke, so it looks like we'll be watching it at home after all. Probably a blessing in disguise as I'm trying to save as much money as possible at the moment. The cost of sending in our immigration application for processing is £630  each , and I've also got the holiday to Canada in September to pay for. Eek indeed.  If you'll excuse me, I have breakfast sushi to eat and a library to open up...

       Cats  I bought Venue magazine this morning and they have a whole big article on the best places for short breaks in the West Country. Really could have done with that last week when planning our trip to Cornwall, but never mind - I think I've chosen well anyway.  I think the Easter Vac is going to drive me mad - really. I don't have an awful lot of work to do, but I'm forcing myself to do a horribly dull and repetitive task just to keep me going. Even that won't last long now. At least I've got plenty on the net to keep me occupied.  I've been thinking about my cat Gizmo a lot recently for some reason. It's almost 2 year since he died. He was a great character and I do miss him. I miss having a cat around the place, and our entire neighbourhood seems to be dog-orientated so I don't even see many out on the street. I think I've seen maybe three in the whole time we've lived there. I'm just starting to make friends with a timid young ginger thing from the house opposite the bus stop - she seemed to recognise me yesterday and didn't jump off the wall and go running off like she's normally tempted to do.  I'm reading 2 books at the moment. My "read at work" book is Kate Atkinson's  urlLink Behind the Scenes at the Museum , which I've nearly finished. I wasn't sure I liked her style at first but I've really got into it, and the book is tragic in a funny sort of way. It's hard to believe that there are people who really live like that - who are beset by tragedy after tragedy but also have the most hellish family to boot. My "read at home" book is Douglas Coupland's  urlLink Hey Nostradamus  which is good in a different way. I like his style - kind of throwaway contemporary cool but with something profound to say. I also like the fact that the novel is set in North Vancouver (where we'd like to end up) and so a lot of his writing is filled with Vancouver asides that I can relate to.

       Pool halls, restaurants, bars and nightclubs  I beat Graham at pool last night - twice (almost - hit the white in after the black the first time round). I don't think he was too amused, especially as I have beaten him at his golfing Xbox game as well recently.   We went out for dinner again - naughty, but payday is on Friday. Decided to check out  urlLink Teohs  at the Old Tobacco Factory. I ate Malaysian curry which was OK, Graham's thai basil chicken was lovely. I don't think we'll be hurrying to go back, though it is good value. Forgot to check out the theatre events going on there - nay mind.  Al rang last night. He is not moving to Boston just yet, which is a shame for him but I'm sure he'll get there sometime this year. He is just about to launch his new bar near Leicester Square. Apparantly he is renting the place on Friday nights for the forseeable future and the launch night is Good Friday. I'm very tempted to get down to London for it. We've always wanted our own bar. What with that and Justin's monthly club night (Lost City Nights at Sub-Logic near Oxford Circus) I could have my weekends in London sorted - if I ever manage to get down there!

       Slapstick comedy, slap-up meal  Feeling a bit weird today. Cold and my scalp keeps tingling. Don't feel ill though, so that's OK. And I've nearly caught up on my sleep.  Had some bad news from Australia about my aunt on Friday, which put me on a downer for the rest of the day. Mum and I promised that we wouldn't get drunk and melancholy on Saturday though, and we managed just about - we had a good time at the theatre watching The Play What I Wrote which was very funny (based around a Morecombe and Wise tribute), and then went out to eat like posh pigs in the evening.  Colleys provided a great night as usual and I ate nearly everything put in front of me, which came as some surprise. We ate some hors d'oeuvres (mackeral pate, liver pate, cous cous salad, pasta salad, potato salad, beetroot etc etc), then were served curried courgette soup with sultanas and toasted coconut. For entree we had the choice of chicken liver in a mint batter with spicy salsa or potato and celeriac dauphinois and Mum and I had a bit of both. Then we had lemon sorbet before the mains were served. We had 4 choices - roast lamb with mashed potato, gravy and sundried tomato pesto, pork loin wrapped in parma ham with something and horseradish, fillet of sea bass with warm pimento and butter bean salad, or wild mushroom and thyme tartlet. Mum and I went for the lamb, which was too chewy but otherwise nice, Dad had the fish which tasted lovely, and Graham had the veggie option.  THEN, came pudding - there were loads of them and they all looked as nice as each other. There were profiteroles the size of tennis balls, bread and butter pudding with amaretto cream and marzipan crust, eton nests, lemon and lime parfait, apple tart with toffee apple ice cream, a huge wedge of cheese with pickled onions and crisps - and more that I can't remember. I settled on eating half my bread and butter pudding and attempting an eton nest - but there was so much cream that I couldn't think about finishing. We ended with coffee and blended cheeses and crackers (which I couldn't help but try to polish off after all that sweet pudding).  We did try and walk it off by walking home - braving the gale force winds across the Downs. Somehow I managed to drink a small port and stay up until midnight to wish mum a happy mother's day before collapsing into bed.  Sunday was spent recovering. Watched a great Grand Prix (Jenson Button got his first podium - yay! - and the rest of the field weren't  too  far behind Michael Schumacher) and 2 films, had a bath and went to bed at the absurd hour of 8.30pm.  I really need to up the exercise and eat even smaller portions this week to cancel out the shocking amounts I put in my stomach this weekend.  It was such a lovely sunny breezy morning this morning when I walked into work, but it's forecast thunder and hail later. Can hardly wait.  The Easter Vac has started. Very quiet in here today but I've got enough work to be getting on with for now. The up side is that we now get quarter of an hour extra for lunch each day - so I'm off to utilize that little perk right now.

       Delhi belly  bleurgh.  Have a sensitive tummy this morning. Graham and I went out to Wetherspoons for their cheap curry night and some drinks. It was meant to be enjoyable but somehow we ended up getting on each other's nerves by the end of the night, and then I had a very bad stomach - so all in all wasn't the best night ever! Ah well, these things happen.  I'm having a rest from emigration things today. Think I deserve at least one stress-free day a week.  Hopefully, by the end of today Graham will have booked our hotel in Boscastle - we'll be staying at the   urlLink Bottreaux Hotel  .   Mum and Dad are coming tomorrow. We're going somewhere which is still a surprise for dad so I can't put details here just yet. Then in the evening I'm buying them dinner at  urlLink Colleys Supper Rooms . By the end of the 7 courses we are going to be absolutely stuffed, and I don't expect we will want to eat anything all day on Sunday, which might be a problem for mum and dad if they are intending to go out for a Mother's Day meal! Been looking forward to this meal since about November, so hope everything is good.  It's the last day of term today so am expecting the library to be busy - but so far it hasn't been and we're both sitting here bored. Might have something to do with the weather - those who have ventured out in the rain and gales are walking around looking very bedraggled. I remember as a student that it was quite easy to stay in bed on days like these, especially in the last week of term with all the parties and club nights to go to.  Might be going indoor skiing over the Easter weekend. I'd like to learn to ski, especially if we're going to end up near a mountain in Canada. But the last time I tried it on a dry ski slope, I fell over and nearly broke my thumb as it got stuck in one of the holes, so I am a little bit apprehensive. Hopefully, though, I'll be better on fake snow as it has no holes in it!

       Organising relief  I slept nearly all night!  And before I went to bed I spent 1.5 hours organising our application stuff into little sections with a post-it note on each saying what we still need to collect for that section and things are really coming along. Did loads of photocopying this morning and am feeling quite positive.  Does anyone know a magistrate who will witness a statutory declaration or two for free? Or a public notary who will notarise a few contracts without charging a complete fortune?  Mum rang last night. Her and dad aren't going to Bali on their way to Oz, as it's a no-go area at the moment and they wouldn't be able to get travel insurance that covered them going there. It's a shame, but they do get to pamper themselves in Singapore twice now.   I have decided on North Cornwall for my birthday weekend away in May. Boscastle to be precise, as it has dramatic coastline and looks quite a romantic sort of little village on a harbour. It is also well placed for trips out to Tintagel, Bude, Polzeath and Padstow. Trying to decide between two places to stay - the trendyish Bottreaux Hotel or the B&B right near the harbour which looks a little more cosy and romantic. Both have well rated restaurants and are close to pubs so we're all right there!

       Spring has sprung, dinner's done  Spring is definitely in the air. It was really warm last night walking home - especially as I originally had 2 fleeces on! All the students have started revising for their exams and the sun is out and it's making me a little nostalgic for my student days.  I had an awful night's sleep last night, so the pulse-point oil didn't work it's magic. But I have got lots and lots done on the emigration front so I'm feeling in a good mood. Wrote letters and organised the whole folder last night - it's going to cost a lot in postage when we finally send it off.  Graham cooked kebabs and they were lovely. I think I have cousin Martin to thank for inspiring him. He can now cook 2 dishes - fajitas and kebabs!  I've been trying to plan a holiday over my birthday. Originally intended to go to Salzburg for a long weekend but have recently been thinking of flying to Inverness and touring the highlands for 5 days. Unfortunately I have just found out that I only have 2.5 (+ 45 mins) days of holiday left to take this year (I took 5 days from this year for Oz, 15 for Canada in September) so my plans have been scuppered a bit. I could still go for the intended amount of time if I work up a few hours lieu time, but that would mean I have no leave left for emergencies (like waking up depressed on a dark cold November morning wanting to take a day off the next day to cheer myself up). I'm starting to think of alternatives for a long weekend closer to home.

       Progress, love  Wow. It's amazing how being down one day can make the fairly normal day after seem really good!  Seem to have moved a couple of steps forward in the collecting information field. Graham has been in touch with all his past employers now and they are all on the case. This morning as I left I spotted 2 letters in the post for us. I didn't have time to open them, but one was from Graham's old company that was being a bit of a pain as regards the contract - and the envelope looked thicker than just one piece of A4 and a business card so I think out threats of immigration officials phoning them for info scared them into finding Graham's contract. The other letter, I think, I hope, contains the 2 copies of my birth certificate that I have been waiting on for a month now.  Application forms for Subject Access (police clearance) are being sent off today.  Graham was lovely last night and made up for upsetting me on Saturday. He made me a smoothie that I had for breakfast this morning. He is also making dinner tonight so that's a bonus. He was doing a night shift last night so went off to work at 10pm, and I went straight to bed with a few drops of relaxing oil on my pulse points which did the trick for a bit. Slept a bit better than I have done in a while anyway. At 5am I woke up and reached my hands under the pillow for a bit of coolness and found a children's picture book entitled "Guess how much I love you?". Awwww, what a cutie!

       Hmmm....  That was a weird weekend. Friday night was nice, but we all fell asleep quite early! They are so excited about the wedding, it's really nice.  On Saturday we went kite flying on the Downs for a bit before Matt and Sharon left. Then Graham upset me so I was angry at him. Just after that his mum rang to tell him that his uncle was very ill again and had been admitted to hospital, so I had to change from angry to sympathetic, and it didn't quite work so we just went to sleep for a couple of hours.  We went out in the evening for a couple of drinks to try and cheer up but Graham felt lousy, so we just got takeaway and went back home. He was sick straight after dinner and went to bed. He still feels lousy now.  I haven't really caught up on my sleep. It didn't help that Sam downstairs started yelling and cheering and hollering at the TV from 5am on Saturday. I'm going to let him off this once, since it is the first test cricket match that India have played against Pakistan in 14 years so he must have been very excited, but if he keeps yelling at that time for the next 4 tests then I shall have to have words with him.  Didn't get anything done re emigration as we were both feeling pants yesterday. We'll have to try and catch up this week.  Ho hum, hopefully the week will get better!  I would like to know why my tastes have completely changed recently. I never fancy curry anymore when I used to be addicted to it (and I still like if I do have it). I seem to want to eat a lot of pasta and tuna and pesto and sandwiches of all things! I've never really been into sandwiches - used to take pizza and quiche and soup etc to school because I was bored of bread. But now I'm really into them for lunch.  It might have something to do with me being a bit more healthy recently. I've been making myself eat smaller portions most of the time, and I've been walking 45 mins to work and sometimes 20 mins back most days. I don't think I've lost much weight but I seem to be getting a  little  thinner around the face. Apparently.

       Friends  It's less than an hour until the weekend begins - hurrah!  I'm very very tired due to the insomniacal nature of my week, but I have invited my friend Matt and his girlfriend Sharon over for dinner, so no rest for the wicked. Three courses of lovely nosh have been planned and half-prepared and lots of alcohol, nibbles and breakfast items have been written on the lovely boyfriend's shopping list so all is set for a good night.  Actually Matt and Sharon are now engaged (Sharon popped the question on Feb 25th because she couldn't wait until the traditional Feb 29th) so I should start getting my head around calling her his fiance. They're doing wedding-plan-related things today before they come round so I think that might be one of the larger topics of conversation tonight.  It's unbelievable but, for the the 7/8 years I've been good friends with Matt (at least 3 of them when we were always in each other's pockets), I've never cooked him a proper meal. I mean, not in the small dinner party sense anyway. Well I hope he and Sharon like it, because I've put a fair bit of effort into making this a good evening. We shall be eating prawn cocktail with smoked salmon, vegetarian moussaka with roasted mediterranean vegetables and halloumi cheese, and tiramisu. We shall be drinking lots of wine (sparkling, white and red) and lots of stella. I shall probably fall asleep at 9.45pm.

       Insomnia  Well, I have had a week of annoying insomnia. I wake up at about 3-4am every night and can't get back to sleep because I have so much stuff whirling about inside my head. My mind races like one of those horrible red cars that are going to ruin the sport of Formula 1 again this year.  I've tried not thinking, but that hasn't been successful and I have come to the conclusion that if I'm going to have insomnia I might as well be productive with my thoughts otherwise I'm just tired and grouchy with no positives to balance it.  Milky drinks don't help. Alcohol makes it worse. Sleeping on the sofa has some effect, but I still only manage to doze for a few minutes at a time. I think the only thing that will help is getting our visa application in but that won't happen for a few weeks yet. If it was just the forms to fill in then the job would be easy but we've got so much supporting information still to collect, not to mention the nightmare headache that we've been working off a completely different visa office checklist to seemingly everyone else in our boat.  We're applying under the Skilled Worker category with my boyfriend, Graham, as principal applicant (my job aint skilled enuff gov) and me as his dependent (god I hate that term) common-law partner. At the moment there are not an awful lot of checks on our checklist.   We're still waiting on: letters from our primary schools to prove we have had as much education as we claim; my full birth certificate (which should have arrived by yesterday); letters of reference and contracts from all our previous employers (I've had so many "little" jobs like temping, voluntary and relief work that this proves difficult); police certificates (to be sent off for this weekend, take up to 40 days to arrive); transcripts of Graham's degree...  We've got to write letters 1) detailing our relationship backed up with as much evidence as possible to prove that we have been living together these past 2.5 years; 2) explaining why we should get maximum points for our English language ability since we are not submitting IELTS test results (erm....we were born in England, raised in England, have spoken English all our lives, educated in English, work in English companies....); 3) explaining that Graham's previous employers are complete arses and won't provide him with a contract  And there's so much more, but it just makes me stressed to think about it so I won't carry on. All I can say is that I will be so relieved when the application is finally posted so that I can just relax a bit for the 2 years that it takes the visa office to make a decision! Then it will be onto the even harder part - but we won't think about that till it happens.

       Wash out  I hear that parts of London have been flooded and that some tube stations were closed - what a pain for those needing to commute out of the city. But anyway it looks like this rain is set to stay with us until the end of time. It's going to be a soggy bank holiday but I'm sure we'll make the most of it anyway. There's 2 great films on at the cinema that I want to see -  urlLink Kill Bill Volume 2  and  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . Apparently, the latter may have a trailer of a film ( urlLink Garden state ) written, directed and starring the main guy out of Scrubs and it's supposed to be one of the best trailers of all time - I've heard that people have got addicted to it, downloading it online and watching it over and over again, frame by frame. So I'm looking forward to that!  We're not going to be able to send the application off this weekend after all as Graham's transcripts won't be arriving until next week. Darn. Oh well, at least the end is in sight. I'm going to be doing a lot of celebrating when we finally get word from the courier that it has arrived safe and sound in the arms of one of the Canadian High Commission's members of staff. The champers is on standby.  We've got a Dyson! Sorry that's old news, but very exciting. I haven't used it yet, but I intend to tonight and am actually looking forward to doing the housework for once. We're selling our old hoover to Kerrianne (library assistant here) so everybody is happy!  Am determined not to play on the Xbox tonight. Well not for more than half an hour anyway. We stopped playing just after 10 last night and it was the first time since Monday that I haven't been dreaming of racing around the streets of Edinburgh/Stockholm/Yokohoma (delete as appropriate). Probably only because I watched the end of High Fidelity for half an hour before going to bed.  One of our students walked in this morning with 3 bottles of diet coke. I think she's here for the duration. That's 12 hours of solid study. I haven't seen her move yet, but she's 1 bottle down already. People are acting a bit oddly at the moment - there's nothing like a few exams to ease the onset of mild mental illness.  It's May on Saturday - yay, my favourite month. Nearly my birthday too. And I've got a weekend away in Cornwall and Matt's engagement party to look forward to as well as 2 Bank holidays. The weather has just  got  to get better.

       Zoom zoom zoom   Having Broadband is very good and very bad at the same time. Xbox Live is evil. We have been playing it until way too late every night. Racing against random strangers on Project Gotham 2 is somehow far more addictive than playing against computer cars. And I beat Graham on the last race of the night - haha!  Today Graham is getting a bankers draft to pay for the visa application. All that's left to do now is write a covering letter and have our photos taken and decide whether we are going to use a courier to get the package to London or trust Royal Mail. I think too much depends on this package to let Royal Mail get their mitts on it so using a courier will be well worth the extra money. So, all being well, we're looking at our little parcel being sent off this weekend. Eek!  Mum rang this morning from Melbourne - they are heading back to Wangaratta already after spending a few days with my cousin. I can't believe how quickly their time there is going. They'll be off to Brisbane shortly. Emzy emailed today from San Francisco - she is having a great time and walking herself thin. They are heading to Yosemite national park tomorrow, then onto Death Valley, Las Vegas and Los Angeles before their next flight takes them to Fiji. I try hard not to be envious!  It's miserable and rainy and cold today - am hoping this will be the last of the bad spring weather as we're all hoping for a bit of sunshine in our lives so we can sit outside and drink beer and run around being happy.

       Blackouts  The weekend turned out quite nice in the end - really warm weather so we were out most of Saturday. The only problem was that Graham has developed bruising around his ribs and has been in agony - he can't move properly and finds breathing hard too. It is slowly getting better now with a good deal of painkillers to hand - thankfully he doesn't seem to have done any lasting damage.  Saturday was a good day - watched Button storming his way to pole position in the qualifying. Yay! Had a few drinks outside various places on the Whiteladies Road, then we got a rug, a bottle of wine, a bottle of champagne and some nibbles and picked a spot on the Downs to sit and chill out until the sun came down and it started getting too cold to stay out (Graham had his shorts on). It was the first of many summer days to come in our "back garden". Got very drunk, had a good long chat about Canada, got emotional about family and laughed at drunken teenagers spinning around with a branch in their hands, trying to jump on it and falling over. Then we went back to watch Kill Bill on DVD and Graham spiked my Fanta with vodka so I ended up in a bit of a drunken slumber by the end of it. I must have blacked out as the next thing I know Graham was really upset with me for not having helped him into bed (he was in a lot of pain). I swear I was asleep on the sofa all the time, but he reckons that I spoke to him and just ignored his requests....  Sunday was good because Button came second in the Grand Prix. He must get a win this year, surely, but that would mean Schumacher's car breaking down - and that hasn't happened in about 50 races, so maybe he won't after all. We didn't do a lot else that day apart from housework and TV watching, and I wrote one of the letters we need to submit in our application for Canada.  Today I have the tune whistled by Daryl Hannah in Kill Bill going constantly in my head and it is really annoying me. Apparently it is the theme tune of a really bad British 60's slasher flick written by the guy who did the music for Psycho.  Work has been busy but fairly normal, apart from a huge power cut we had for half an hour earlier. We are still only running on backup power now, apparently, and might be doing so for some days as the main cable supplying the whole university has been damaged - industrial sabotage? Once we got back on power I was trawling the Lonely Planet website and came across a posting from someone who had been trapped in a lift in a powercut today - turns out he/she works at the uni in the maths department. Weird when you meet someone randomly online when they are just up the road from you.  We have just got broadband installed at home. Graham is over the moon and I expect he will be playing on Xbox live forever more. At least I'll be able to use the phone at the same time though. I might just be able to get him to take me to the supermarket tomorrow if I'm lucky...but I won't hold my breath!

       O.K....   I take it all back. Graham was tired but not in a bad mood when I got home and instead he was lovely and cuddley because he had missed me. He's still a daft apeth for falling off a wall though, and he is in a sorry state. Hopefully he won't need to go to the doctors.  It's 2pm and I don't know where the day has gone - into a black hole or something.  I have just finished  urlLink The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle . Man, that was one hell of a read. There's something amazing about the way Murakami writes, he somehow makes the mundaneness of everyday life seem very very interesting, and when bizarre things start to happen you just accept them at face value. Like sitting down in a bottom of a dry well clearing your head of all thoughts so that you can pass into another darker world and defeat whatever it is that is causing all these bizarre things to happen is just as normal as making spaghetti and listening to classical music and stroking your cat. The ending left so many loose ends that will never be tied up, but I felt satisfied with it anyway.  I also finished reading  urlLink The Lovely Bones  by Alice Sebold the other week - it was a really nice story and I find that the characters remain in my head even now, wondering how they are all getting on. Considering it is a book about a teenage girl getting raped and murdered and commentating from heaven about how her family are coming to terms with her death, it is a surprisingly uplifting read, and the main character (Susie) infects you with a love of the simple things in life.  I'm now onto reading  urlLink Girlfriend In A Coma  but i'm not finding it as instantly appealing as the other Douglas Coupland book I read. I may get into it yet (I'm only on chapter 4), but I'm not finding the characters so engaging.  I have to teach Kerrianne about the wonderful world of journal binding now...

       The drunk boyfriend  Graham's impossible when he gets drunk. I phoned him last night to ask him about the heating - I had been freezing and wanted to turn it on, but it wasn't going on. Turned out he had switched the gas off at the wall, but the conversation around him telling me that was hard. The guys from Nortel were paying for a night out for him and Shaun and they had been out drinking since 6. At 10 O'clock he was completely bladdered and speaking a lot of gibberish, repeating himself and talking to me as if I was a little kid. I also got lucky, getting to speak to Shaun as well who was only slightly more comprehendable (is that a word?). Once I'd got the heating to work it smelt of burnt sawdust so I turned it all off again and went to bed. I stupidly texted Graham to tell him this and he rang me and went on for about 10 minutes about switching all the switches off (which I already had) and how I was cold because he wasn't there to cuddle me.  I knew he was going to be feeling really rough this morning so I thought I'd better phone him (at 10.30 so he could have a lie in) to see how he was. He said that he was broken. They went on to a pub/club after the restaurant and drank even more (wine, champagne, beer, you name it). He went outside to get some fresh air at some point and fell off a wall, and he now has a painful twisted knee and sore hand to show for it. He can't remember anything much about the night (he couldn't even remember speaking to me), and nor can any of the others. I said that I hoped he hadn't done anything foolish and he said "I did, I fell off a wall!", I said "I meant in front of people" and he said that the whole thing was captured on CCTV and showed to him this morning. Silly boy.  So, unfortunately, when I come home tonight he will be tired and sore and probably in just a bad a mood as when he left on Sunday so once again I won't get a happy boyfriend to snuggle with.   Grump, grump, grump.  Sandy the cat ran towards me this morning - so she is now officially my friend. Unfortunately I seem to be allergic to her fur and spent the hour after stroking her with itchy eyes and nose. But it was worth it. I want a cat!!! I also want to spend my whole life travelling and solve the world's ills with a click of my fingers, but it just isn't going to happen. I want doesn't get, in most cases anyway.  I treated myself to a Starbucks chai tea latte this morning but wish I hadn't as I tripped up the steps on my way to work and spilt it all over my fleece. dime bar, that's me.

       Chicken   Have been having fun with the  urlLink Subservient Chicken  today. Try it out. It doesn't do everything but it does attempt to stand on its head and lay an egg if you ask. Type in taco bell or burger king for more weirdness.  Determined to eat nice things, I started out with a hot chocolate this morning followed by a little sushi. Had a fruity smoothie for break, and pasta with tuna for lunch. Went downhill a bit just now with a packet of McCoys unfortunately. I'm a sucker for the advertising. Tonight I will eat pizza and carrot cake and drink lots of tea. For punishment I will do lots of housework, trying to get the last of the dust and dirt out of the flat.  I saw the ginger cat again yesterday, and she has a proper name (Sandy) and an older step-sister who kept trying to butt Sandy out of the way to get me to stroke her instead. It made me happy anyway.  Been using my time without Graham to chill out to some music. Before I moved in with him I used to sit in my bedroom a lot of the time just listening to my favourite CDs and relaxing with my thoughts, but I don't often listen to music now, and when I do, it tends to be something that we both like as he's not really into my tastes. And yes, I have watched 4 episodes of Ally McBeal on DVD, but since the Xbox sounds like it is going to blow up (big buzzing noises) I have decided not to do the marathon thing.  I'm a bit appalled at the lack of decent comedy on terrestrial tv these days. There used to be Ally, and Spaced and Scrubs and Frasier and Malcolm in the Middle, and Little Britain etc etc, but now there is just Friends and the hideous Will and Grace. I wish we had a comedy channel on our digital box, with all the things I like (rather than just reruns of Cheers like Paramount seemed to have). I'm also a bit gutted to learn that although Scrubs is well into it's 3rd season (with 20-something episodes per season), it's not actually made its way onto DVD yet - any region. Boo.  Oh, and Canucks lost to Flames last night, so now I will have to back Calgary and Montreal in the Stanley Cup. Oh well "there's always next year".

       Tired and emotional  I was so emotional yesterday. Was crying for about an hour after Graham left. I was upset at first because I wanted to spend some nice cuddling time with him before he went away but he was in a bad mood because he couldn't chip his Xbox and he had a sore back. But even after he left I continued to cry for no discernable reason - I'm not the crying kind. Maybe it's the new pill I am taking.  Well, the doors look very nice, even without having been painted - so all the mess was worth it. Spent close to 3 hours hoovering the flat to get rid of all the wood chippings and sawdust. It's so hard to hoover the carpet as it is thick and woolen and the bits of wood just get stuck in it. I'm giving it another go tonight, but then giving up and from then on we'll have to clean up the flat by taking the occasional splinter in our feet.  Mum rang from Oz yesterday. Was really nice to hear her voice. They seem to be having a good time. Maureen is responding well to treatment so far. Zoe seems to be even more adorable now that she has golden curls and can talk and walk, and even gives kisses now instead of just hugs. It's my turn to be jealous of my parents!  Canucks beat Flames Saturday night - the score was 5-4, the winning goal only being scored in 3rd overtime. Must have been one hell of a match to be at. All I can do now is cross my fingers and hope they pull through in the last game tonight. Their future in the playoffs depends on this one game. EEEEeeeeeeee, I'm excited don't you know.  Well it's just turned 6pm so it's hometime for me.

       Bed head  The students are being noisy today. Fed up of telling them to shut up. I hate doing the whole "Shhhhhhhhh!" librarian bit.  Oh poo. The Canuckleheads lost against Calgary last night. Only 2 games left. If Calgary win tomorrow night then Vancouver are out of the Stanley Cup and Graham's bro won't let us hear the end of it.  The atmosphere between Graham and I was much improved last night since he has the day off today and so wasn't so stessed. I spent most of the night having my hair cut (at long last) and cooking tonight's food though so didn't really take advantage of it! I hope the door replacing shenanigans are going well today. Haven't heard anything so I assume everything is going to plan.  My hair is now a bit shorter and a lot tidier, and the woman who cut it was like a less educated 40-year-old version of me - so we got on really well. She was a really down-to-earth sort which relaxed me a lot as I hate the trendy types who look at your hair snobbily and think only of fashion (it was a trendy salon so I was dreading getting the same sneering look as the receptionist gave me when I booked the other day. Maybe it's all in my mind because I feel a certain sense of inadequacy, but I don't think so). Not sure it was worth £35, but there don't seem to be any cheap hair salons around this area!  I'm drawing a bit of a blank today - not really in the writing mood I guess, so I'll leave this for now and hope to have more to say after the weekend.  Peace. Unity. Love. And having fun.

       Wedding bells  So everyone seems to be proposing to each other at the moment. First it was Matt and Sharon, and yesterday I had an email inviting me to the engagement party of my friend Tim from uni, and then Alex told me that Amber (mate from school) has also been proposed to. Liz from uni is also getting married sometime soon, but I'm so crap that I haven't spoken to her in a long long time and so I don't know what her plans are.  I wonder who will be next? No, it's not going to be me and Graham - he still seems to be very anti all that stuff, and there hasn't been the most romantic atmosphere between us of late (hopefully that will change pretty soon - the atmosphere not the anti-marriage stuff).  Al seems to have finally accepted the fact that he works too hard and needs a break. He has managed to get a 4-month career break in order to go and chill out on a deserted island in Thailand for 3 months. It's all rather sudden, but then he was talking about going last year and never made it, so it's not exactly surprising. I hope he can get used to the idea of doing nothing for so long!  I'm not really looking forward to the next few days. Tomorrow Graham's mum and her partner are coming down because Graham and Keith are going to replace all the internal doors in our flat. I know it will look lovely when it's all done but I can imagine it's going to be all messy and noisy for a couple of days. I'll be out of the flat as much as possible with Crystal, leaving the men to it (they don't want us hanging around getting in the way - their words, not our excuse). Then on Sunday Graham is going away with work for 3 nights and I'm going to miss him. Suppose I should make the most of the free time to do what I want to do (which probably involves watching Neighbours and Home and Away, eating junk food and watching 10 episodes of Ally McBeal back to back) but I find it difficult sometimes when he's not around because since I started living with him I rely on him for my routine. When he's not here I tend to forget about making dinner till it's too late, and forget about going to bed until I wake up on the sofa at 1am. God, that makes me sound so sad!  Mum and Dad will be in Wangaratta, Australia now, cooing over my cousin Lorraine's baby Zoe (I really miss her, she's so so cute - I'd never really liked babies much till I met her) and waiting for my aunt to get back from her chemo session. I hope she feels OK throughout the treatment and that they are all able to have a fairly good time together. I'm going to be thinking about them so much over the next few weeks.  Emzy will be off on her trip round the world now. She's off to California first, then heading to Fiji before stopping in New Zealand for 8 months to work and travel around. Then it's Australia, Thailand and India. Lucky girl. Well, I had my chance and I only went for 11 weeks because I didn't want to work abroad so it was my own fault. Now I'm hoping not just to work abroad but to live there too! One of these days I should appreciate living where I am now instead of thinking about all the other places in the world, but it's hard to get a grip sometimes. There's just so many places I want to visit - I could spend my whole life travelling and never see enough. OK, the UK is nice, but it's a tiny island in a huge big world of adventure and that is why I don't want to spend my whole life living here.

       Work, snooze, work  Well, it's back to work. Had a great Easter break - one of the best ever.  Thursday - Ed came round for drinks and chat. Was really good to see him, and we all got drunk (me more than anyone else) which contributed to me having a splitting headache all day Friday until I started drinking again.  Friday - bright sunny morning, cruising down the M4 listening to feel good music - which made us feel good. Hotel was nice enough and very well located. Had lunch then went to the Natural History Museum for a bit of culture. Blue whales are BIG. Sperm whales are funny looking. Fascinated by hundreds of stuffed dead birds (not of the Xmas-dinner variety). Onto Al's bar and a great night was had by all. Started off small scale, but just the right size and crowd to get the piano player and Tim the singer in the mood - very entertaining. Later the bar filled up possibly a bit too much - but that had to be a good sign. I got chatting with a few people I don't see very often, and also spent a fair amount of the night on the door with Alex, trying to stop people from leaving rather than going in! Don't think the guestlist was checked by anyone. The bar closed at 11.30pm and so Graham, Hing-Yu and Julie and I went for dinner in Chinatown. Singapore noodles and chicken satay at 12.30 wasn't the best idea for me, and my stomach complained the next day.  Saturday - on our way from our hotel in Russell Square to meet Hing for lunch at Waterloo we passed lots of touristy things(Covent Garden, Downing St, Trafalgar Square etc) and went into the National Gallery for a while which was so fab I can't think why I've never been there before. After a naff lunch we went back to Hing's for coffee and Xbox before driving home.  Sunday - Liz and Kel came down and we went out for pizza in Clifton. On our way to a bar afterwards Liz walked into a post and really hurt herself but we couldn't do anything but laugh amidst making sympathetic noises. Had a couple of drinks and cooed over the pub's Rottweiler puppy. Couldn't be bothered to go out in the evening so Graham and I curled up on the sofa to watch Moulin Rouge and I cried for ages afterwards because it bothered me that she wasn't allowed to enjoy her happiness!  Monday - went to see Shaun of the Dead at the cinema. It was a real sunny day so cinema was practically empty. Film was very silly in the way I like best, and so I gave it a thumbs up. Then we went out on the town, exploring new drinking/eating areas around the university - found a couple of nice small "local" pubs, then went and had a curry at our usual place, and that was empty so the waiter Naz sat down next to us and spoke to Graham about cars for our whole meal. Ah well, he's only 19 - so he only has cars and girls on his brain.  Tuesday - lazed about all day. Went to try and have my haircut but couldn't get an on the spot appointment, so I'm booked in for Thursday night. Then went to the solicitors to have things signed - he was a weird guy, glad our business with him only took 15 minutes.  Today - back to work. Back to the usual routine of having no work and kipping on my lunch break. It has been busier today though at least. Sue brought me back a pint of scrumpy in a jug from her hols in Cornwall so I'm going to give it to Graham tonight as I can't stand the stuff!

       Elation   Wow, I'm in such a good mood today. Happiness almost to the point of excitement. The new girl started work this morning - we've been gossiping all day. We're pretty similar so we've had plenty to talk about.  And I've now got a 5 day holiday - hurrah!  Canucks beat the Flames 5-3 last night to claim their first victory of the best-of-seven first round playoff.  Mum and Dad are on their way to the airport now - flying at 10pm tonight.  Happy Easter.

       Phone calls  Feel a bit numb today. Calm but bored.  This morning I performed a meaningless task. In order to become more aware of what's going on during my walk to work I counted how many paces I took. It was made all the more meaningless since I only started counting about a fifth of the way across the Downs. But from there to the door at work it was 3712 paces. Tomorrow I am going to take notice of every single shop or business that I walk past. I can't tell you why I would want to do this - I'm just weird.  Mum rang me a while ago. She's off to Australia tomorrow so wanted to talk to me as she knew I was going out tonight. Going to miss them over the next few weeks, but she's good at updating me by email and phone.  Last night Ed rang and said he couldn't come for dinner because he was on medication for a poorly tummy, but he will still come to see us and our flat on Thursday. Al rang too, giving me the lowdown on the bar's pricelist which he knew I wasn't going to like too much (cheap as far as London prices go, expensive for us Bristolians). He said that he hadn't priced the wines yet so I told him to make sure that the house wine was affordable so I could drink that all night. Looking forward to it - I might even sing my heart out round the piano if I'm feeling brave enough.  I phoned Cheltenham Library today to find out why they haven't sent me the details I'd asked for. I was told by the nice man at the desk that the person I had sent the letter to was on leave so I left a message and asked him to get the office administrator to phone me as I knew she knew me and figured that Sue would probably have spoken to her about it. She just phoned to say that the person I had sent the original letter to had left (? "left" and "on leave" are very different things), that they didn't have any records of me anymore but that she was going to fax through the letter to someone in personnel who had promised that they would act on it immediately. So hopefully I will have a letter from them stating that they no longer have any details for me if nothing else. I have my P45 from them anyway and a list of all the hours I worked for them up to the September because it had been printed out once when I had queried how much I was getting paid.  No word from Burger King either but that's hardly surprising. I thought I had better not ring them at lunchtime - I know how mental it gets there at that time of day. I'll give them a bell tomorrow morning but I don't expect that they'll be bothered to help me.  I have come to the conclusion that I'm not much good at talking to people on the phone, I find it so much easier and better face to face. That might be a bit of a problem if I move away!   Graham was in a better mood yesterday, but not quite his usual self - I could tell he really was tired though.  My printer has just run out of toner at a wholly inconvenient time and I'm not quite sure what I did with the replacement cartridge as it had been hanging around my desk for so long that I moved it to somewhere less annoying and buggered if I can remember where.  I think if I just went to sleep for the next 2 hours nobody would notice. They have a little bell that they can ring at me to wake me up if they need me. But I'm going to read Ed's book chapters that he sent me instead, as it's a more constructive use of time and probably more fun.

        Reflections     I think that ginger cat has gone and disappeared on me. Just as I had given her a name - Fizz.  I was in a good mood last night but I got home to find Graham in a strange one. He didn't want to talk about it, said he was just tired, which didn't really seem to be the case. He didn't want to talk, didn't want to cuddle, didn't want to eat, didn't want to read, didn't want to watch TV, didn't want to sleep. Just sat there looking like there was something serious on his mind, but pretty vacant really. I don't know whether it's something to do with me, or with work or something else, but I hope he has a good day today and gets back to his usual self. I take our happiness for granted when everything is going well as it normally does, but just one weird mood from either of us and it can feel a bit delicate. Maybe I am just taking it too personally this time, but I feel that if I can't get him out of a mood and into happiness then I am failing him, which then makes me depressed!  It was so windy walking across the Downs on my way home last night. If Matt and Sharon had tried to fly a kite at that particular time I think they would have taken off, only to land many miles away, perhaps even in the vicinity of the wicked witch of the west.  I walked to work today and was in my own little world as usual. Sometimes I reach work and I can't even remember anything about the journey there I've been so caught up in my own thoughts. I remember when it snowed last month and I had to tread very carefully, it was the first time I had really taken in my surroundings. I had to notice all the little slopes and potholes that I would usually ignore. It's true that it takes something out of the ordinary for you to take notice of the ordinary. Really we should be concentrating on every detail and appreciating it as it's not going to be around forever, but then I guess if you tried to take everything in you would just have sensory overload and your brain would give up. Like the autistic character in the book I read recently - where you or I would see a man, maybe take notice of the colour of his skin and hair and his height and build, he would take in every minute detail of the person's face and body and clothing and smell - he couldn't  not  notice everything and because of this if there was more than one person or thing to concentrate on he couldn't cope, his brain would hurt and he would end up curled up in a ball on the floor, screaming in order to block everything out.  So maybe it is better that my brain chooses what to concentrate on and what to ignore.  Hmmm, taking stock of the week. This is the last evening me and Graham have free together for the next few days, so I'd like to relax but there are things to do. Cooking and kitchen cleaning at least. Graham was upset because I had cooked some sliced potatoes on a baking tray with no rims, so a load of olive oil had run off and started burning inside the top oven. He reckoned he had to fumigate the place when he had turned the oven on to cook something before I came home last night. So I'll have to clean that out, and whilst I'm doing that I might as well do the hob and the units and the floor.  Tomorrow night we go to the Ruparells at 8pm. Sanjay and his wife - I must remember to find out her name before we turn up on their doorstep otherwise we will appear very rude. On Thursday night my friend Ed is coming over for dinner and drinks - he hasn't been able to see our flat yet as he's been in Brighton for most of the year doing his teacher training course. I'll be glad to see him - I guess he's my only real friend who is kind of Bristol based - not that he ever plans to come back to Bristol for good now, too many bad memories for him. Then on Friday we're off to London. Looks like we will be having lunch with Graham's friend Hing-Yu and going to the Natural History Museum before spending the evening in Alex's bar. We'll probably come back Saturday afternoon, but we have got the option of staying over with either Alex or Hing-Yu if we want to.  Today is going quickly, it's nearly lunchtime. Amber will be here in a minute to cover for me for an hour. Apart from that it's anther one of those days when I'm on my own, with little work to do, few students to bother me and a whole lot of thoughts in my head. I'm trying hard to do something constructive but it's all too easy to start dreaming about houses in Canada when I've got the web at my fingertips - I've already selected 1 house in Salmon Arm, 2 Houses in Vernon, 2 houses in Kelowna and a condo in Vancouver's West End to be on my wishlist. Who knows, I may be able to buy them if I sell myself. But I imagine that I would spend most of my money on trying to buy back my freedom!  Man, who am I trying to kid with all this waffle. Truth is I'm worried about my Auntie Maureen and trying to keep my mind clear of worrying thoughts, but it's not really working. Not that there's anything I can do. I'm going to email my cousin.

       Time management  It might seem like I've done no work today, but I've actually been doing more than normal in between writing this, finding how much I'm worth and general surfing of the web. I just feel in the writing mood today - which can never be a bad thing for me.  We've just arranged to go and see the couple who are moving to Toronto this Wednesday evening. I'm feeling a bit nervous as we can't meet down the pub or somewhere neutral. They've got 3 young children who they find it hard to get babysat so they've invited us round to their house after the kids have gone to bed. I just hope that we've got enough to say to each other!  Fell asleep in my lunch hour again - just dozed off whilst reading. It must be the atmosphere in the stack room where we have our breaks - stuffy, no windows, lots of dusty old things. I would have gone out to air my lungs but it was raining. Thought I heard thunder earlier, but disappointingly it turned out to be people rolling things around on the patio above my head.  Going to see a solicitor next Tuesday to notarise our documents and witness our statutory declaration. We're so near now...  Keep getting a strange sense of deja vu today - it doesn't normally happen this frequently. Wonder what's going on - the flow of the world is shifting round a bit perhaps. Whether that's a good or bad thing, who knows?  I've just ordered some DVDs - play.com has a lot to answer for. I was missing Ally McBeal a lot as it hasn't been on regular telly for eons, so I bought one of the box sets (second half of series 2, the episodes with lots of John Cage and Barry White) and then noticed the special offers. I got hooked on the 3 for £20 offer so I bought  urlLink American History X ,  urlLink Frequency  and  urlLink Magnolia . Thanks Mum and Dad - that was your Easter present to us!  Only an hour left before closing so I'd better get on with this work I've lined up for myself.  FLF

       Self Worth  Just done some stupid quiz to find out how much I'm worth on the open market. Apparently, I am worth $1,592,070.00 (US) - according to www.humanforsale.com Not too bad. If I wanted to sell myself I could buy lots of nice things with that!

       Relaxation and the nature of self  For once I feel refreshed after the weekend. Maybe I should have a bottle of wine every afternoon. I'm joking, of course.  The Canucks won their last game, and Colorado lost, meaning that Vancouver won the Northwest Division, coming third in the Western Conference and they get to play Calgary in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. I'm really looking forward to it - Graham's brother is a Flames fan so I guess we'll be taunting each other every time they play. It's best of 7, the first game this weekend.  Jenson Button got on the podium for the second time in a row - amazing. So cool. It almost made up for the fact that Ferrari got another 1-2 and Michael Schumacher is running away with the championship. My driver of the day was Sato though - he was never that far behind Button and did a great job considering his lack of experience.  I finished Hey Nostrodamus! on Saturday -  all in all I found it a very good back, and I found the ending quite satisfying, unlike Graham who thought the whole of the last chapter sucked. I'm halfway into a new book now and so is Graham - we've started to spend time with each other reading instead of watching the TV recently, which has been really nice. I decided on Saturday that we don't use the rooms in our house enough, so we decamped to the bigger of the spare rooms and spent the afternoon in there - me perched on the beanbag and him sprawled on the futon, listening to the rain come hammering down and getting lost in our individual literary worlds.  We built up our stock of wine on Saturday after visiting one of those wine warehouses. 12 good quality bottles (including 2 champagnes...ahem...I mean sparkling wine...for £75, which was a pretty good deal. We even managed to get our hands on a bottle of Mission Hill pinot blanc - a Canadian favourite of ours (the wine is made in the Okanagan Valley in BC where we're visiting this year).   Watched Adaptation on Saturday night - made by the same people as Being John Malkovich. It wasn't nearly as good, but I quite enjoyed it anyway. Graham had his work cut out trying not to fall asleep.  I'm looking forward to going to London this weekend. Alex's bar should be really good - it's a piano bar with cocktails and stuff, and it's all relaxed and dress-down - he likes to call it Shabby Chic. He-he. Wonder if he regrets that soundbite.  I was doing a hell of a lot of thinking this weekend, about everything under the sun. It was good to exercise my brain. I may share some of the thoughts with you later in the week if I don't get sidetracked by the everyday.  Last Friday I was on the bus and I saw this guy talking to himself - just saying random things. Not gobbledegook - proper sentences, but nothing that had any relevance to what was going on around him. I got to thinking - what if I'm like that. What if I am just walking around in my own little world, talking to all these characters, living what I think is my life when in reality I am some madwoman roaming around in a box room talking to the walls, talking to myself, making up situations in my head, acting them out and being observed by people who are trying to understand what's going on in that brain of mine? It's something I used to think about a lot when I was younger, but that thought hadn't crossed my mind recently until Friday. Maybe I think my life is more important these days so I find it hard to imagine that such an important life is actually all a figment of my imagination?

       Positivity  Blimey. I've not been very good at updating this this week have I?  Well, just been busy I guess.  Driving forward with the application. Today I have been in contact with the local magistrates court and a solicitor about notarising some certificates and witnessing our statutory declaration of common-law union. The person responding from the court suggested that perhaps me or my wife should come to the court in person and discuss the legal matters that were concerning me (mainly diffference between notarising and certifying documents). The fact that they couldn't even get my gender and marital status right left me with cause for concern that their legal advice might not be too accurate either! Meanwhile, a solicitor told me he'd do the lot for £50 which I don't think is too bad considering as some solicitors charge £50+ per document and we wouldn't need to take off time from work to go and see him either.  I asked my employer for the reference letter yesterday and they put it in the post yesterday afternoon. I'm so impressed with them - I really wish my past employers were as efficient. Still no word from 2 of them, so I will need to chase them up. Graham's got all of his stuff from past employers, now just needs a couple of things from past schools, and his contract and reference letter from his current workplace.  I even got my police clearance yesterday, a lot sooner than expected. Graham's should be in the post by Monday, if he hasn't been a naughty boy in the last few years.  Vancouver Canucks are the top of their division for the first time since January and with just 2 games to go it looks like they might be playing Calgary in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs if they keep winning and Colorado keep losing. That should be a good series.  Michael Schumacher is beating everyone again in testing. Hope someone manages to wipe the smile off his face come race day. It's going to be a good one - brand new circuit in Bahrain, so no one really has the advantage and there's going to be a lot of engine blow outs because of all the sand.  Feeling chirpier and less ill today - ready for the weekend.

       Phewee  I don't want to go into it, as some things are too private to be aired here, but Graham and I have just gone through an extremely tense few days leading on from an argument on Saturday night. It has been a very emotional time, and I really thought that this may be it for us. But we have calmed down and explained our views and talked and talked it through and the good news is that we will hopefully find that we have come out of this stronger than ever due to the fact that we now both know all each others grievances and fears and doubts and are in a clear position to eliminate them all so that nothing gets in the way of our happiness.  I feel slightly strange. It probably has a lot to do with how tired I am, but I feel kind of like I entered a chrysalis as a grubby little caterpillar on Saturday night, and was released last night as a butterfly when we finally sorted things out. The relief I felt about getting to the root of our problems and agreeing on how to solve them was immense, and it really did lift my spirits.  At least we know now not to take the relationship for granted, not to let ourselves slip into the same cycle as before. We've got to work together for each other's happiness.

       Hi hoooooo  Oh, I had a very nice time yesterday. I bought (or rather mum and dad bought me) loads of books and some clothes for my birthday. I've now got 2 new T-shirts (one from Crystal and Keith - thank you!), 2 new shirts, some new jeans and some new casual trousers (just in case you thought that I would be getting any of them second hand, like I did some of the books).  Books-wise, these are what I remember getting:  Douglas Coupland -  urlLink Life after God  and  urlLink Generation X  Haruki Murakami -  urlLink South of the Border, West of the Sun  Walter Moers -  urlLink The 13.5 lives of captain bluebear  Jasper Fforde -  urlLink The Eyre Affair  Anne-Marie MacDonald -  urlLink Fall on Your Knees  Michael Marshall -  urlLink The Lonely Dead   There were others too. Then I had a problem deciding which one to read next. Given that I had just started reading Murakami's  urlLink Hard-Boiled Wonderland and The End of the World  at home which is supposed to be a bizarre book, I thought I'd read one of the more serious ones at work so that I don't mix up on madcap plot with another, so I'm now a few chapters into Michael Marshall's one, and really enjoying it.  It was lovely to spend a good deal of time with mum and dad after 6 weeks away from them. They had a great time in Oz and showed us some of the video that they took over there. We traipsed around town all day - as well as shopping I showed them Park Street, Brandon Hill Park, and the harbour area. We were all pretty tired by the time we got home. And stuffed after eating at EAT+, a newish eat-all-you-want chinese/malay place.  I'm really looking forward to going to Cheltenham tomorrow to see all my chums at Matt's engagement party - it's been a long while since I've seen some of them (like Justin and Moz and Felix) and I'm hoping to get drunk and merry and act like a fool around people who I know just won't care! It's all kicking off at 7.30pm so plenty of time to catch up with everyone.  It's also GP weekend - Monaco. I'm not looking forward to the procession if Schumacher gets pole, but Graham is still living in hope that the BAR boys will be able to challenge him. We shall see...  Oh, yeah, and Calgary Flames have pulled off the incredible achievement of winning the Western Conference Finals. They now get to play Philly or Tampa Bay for the Stanley Cup! Go Flames Go!!!!

      Sainsbury's have narked me today.  I picked up a smoked salmon linguine for lunch and I was really looking forward to it. I stuck it in the microwave, and when I came to stir it halfway through I realised that smoked salmon linguine really shouldn't have bits of bacon and leek in and look so  penne -ish. They had put the meal in the wrong packaging, the fools. Anyway, I didn't have time to take it back and it was already half-cooked so I had to eat it - and it tasted fine, but it wasn't what I wanted, and now the leeks are giving me wind.  And to top it all off, I'd bought a tiny sushi box with a salmon ngiri in so I thought I'd get my fishy fix that way - but the thing had a bone in it and it put me right off. I know that they put a warning on the packet to the effect that there might be some small bones remaining even though the fish is filleted, but  really ...I've been eating sushi for a very long time and have never come across one.  But I'm still happy, it won't ruin my day or anything.

       Birthday   Hi, I'm Kate and I'm 26. Yes, that feels OK.  It's going to be a bright, bright sunshiney day. I want to be out in it!  I'm glad it's still sunny, and it's cooler in the library today. Woke up to a good song on the radio and a birthday card from Graham which he left for me when he went to work this morning at 3 a.m. I don't like to wish my life away, but I can't wait for home time today, and I have a feeling that it's going to be a long time coming if I think like that, so I'd better get working hard to distract myself.  I bought a chocolate brownie as a treat this morning, but I've only had a nibble on it so far. I'm actually not that hungry having just drunk a huge tea from Starbucks.  My sunburn has started to brown more now, and is hurting less. I still feel like a daft fool getting burnt in the UK after I was so careful in Oz to cover myself in sunblock from head to foot every day. I shall learn from this lesson...  Feels like a Friday today as I have got the day off tomorrow. I will have to be careful to remember to come in to work on the actual Friday.  I want Chinese food, I can't stop craving it. All because I indulged in some Singapore vermicelli on Monday.  So what's in the news this birthday? Absolutely sod all. The media is still obssessed with these Iraqi abuse claims so that what was at first shocking is now totally boring. David Pleat has quit spurs...Sainsbury's profits have dropped...Tony Randall has died. Nothing major as yet then. I feel sorry for anyone born today who gets a gift of The Times for the day they were born!

       God  Will this day ever end? I'm hot and bored. I can't open the window because it is broken, but I don't think it would help much if I did as there seems to be absolutely no airflow through this building today.  I want to be in Cornwall. Or Canada. Or snuggling with me boyf at home. He is playing ninja games on the Xbox now as he got home at lunchtime due to having to start work at 3am tomorrow morning - my birthday.  So here it is merry christmas everybody's having fun... why on  earth  is that song in my head?  Mum rang this morning, safely back from Singapore.  Alex hasn't emailed me from Thailand yet and I really want to know how he is getting on there. He did send me a short text message to say how stunning the beach and jungle were where he was staying...sigh...  I've just finished reading Girlfriend in a Coma and I have to say that I wasn't particularly impressed with the way the storyline went. I still like his writing style, and I liked most of the characters (although one was so annoying and another, the most interesting one in my opinion, was nowhere near developed enough) but I was expecting more of a twist, more bang for my buck - it went for an awe-inspiring ending and failed to make me feel anything but the apathy that the book was trying to dispel.  Hmmm...it's definitely a ho-hum day today. Ah well, mum and dad are down tomorrow evening and then I have Thursday off so that will be something to look forward to.

       Beautiful  I have just had one of the most perfect weekends in my life.  Thursday - the man from Parcelforce took away our immigration application. I tracked it online, and it was delivered at 9.35 am on Friday 14th May and signed for by somebody called Chin. Graham and I cracked open the bubbly as soon as I got home and then it was all romance and happiness from there. We had a lovely meal in Over the Moon, drank more wine and finished up with a cocktail in a bar by the river - Graham didn't want to go home, but it was just as well we did as I had a hangover in the morning as it was.  Friday - off to Cornwall at 10am. We arrived at Boscastle in good time, and as we descended down the hill through the countryside to the hotel, a mist enveloped us and it was just as I had imagined a Cornish ex-smuggling village to be. We walked down the steep hill, past lots of very very pretty cottages and beautiful houses with beautiful gardens, into the village centre and along to the harbour. I ate the best sausages ever for lunch and then we walked back up the hill to check into our hotel. The hotel, though only 2 stars, was just right - it was small but not so small that the proprieter pounced on you and didn't give you any privacy. We were served some excellent coffee and Danish Butter Cookies whilst she made our room up, and we sat on the chaise longue in the lobby grinning at each other. The finishing touches in our room were superb - a super-king-size bed with the most comfortable mattress and duvet ever, beautiful furniture and a bathroom with a swanky glass sink and stainless steel accessories that had Graham getting the camera out. The floor was also covered in very expensive seagrass carpet, which looked impressive, but was a bit hard on bare feet!  We went out again after check-in - driving towards Tintagel and the sun decided to come out and it stayed out all weekend. The ruins of Tintagel Castle were fab - and because it was a Friday and nobody expected the weather to be so good and it was a weekend between 2 bank holidays, the place was virtually ours. We climbed down the steep steep steps to go across to the island and spent a good few hours wandering around the cliff tops gawping at the spectacular scenery - we were so high up that the twin waterfall below looked like a little trickle. We sat at the cliff edge for a good while, basking in the sun, feeling serenely happy and deciding that if we don't get to Canada then Cornwall might just have to be our Plan B. It was so romantic and the day brought the best out in both of us. I was also very relieved to be finally stress-free about the Canada application. We went out for dinner in the 16th Century pub next door to the hotel in Boscastle and then had an early night.  Saturday - we got up mega early to yet more sunshine. We sat down to a lovely full Cornish breakfast which filled me up for most of the day and then set out towards Padstow. We went via Port Isaac, but because it was still really misty on the hills and by the sea, we could hardly see any of the village as we drove it's tiny narrow lanes - but we could appreciate what it would be like on a clear day. We reached Padstow early and walked around the harbour, up the alleyways admiring all the houses and eventually found ourselves walking through a clifftop meadow with stunning views across the harbour and beach. The sun was shining brightly and just cutting through the mist, trying to evaporate it - Graham took some fab photos. When we got down towards the centre again it had got a lot more crowded. We thought about taking the ferry over to Rock but decided instead to get ourselves a Cornish pastie and then head back towards Polzeath.  We did a bit of surf shopping in Polzeath and walked down the beach to watch the surfers and swimmers and lifeguards. Graham wanted to swim but hadn't brought any swimwear with him. We ate icecream, and laughed at a woman promenading by with her dog that looked exactly liked her. We kissed and cuddled a lot and were very happy. By this time I had started to get quite sunburned. We headed back to Boscastle where we had a drink in the old Cobweb Inn and then walked up to the harbour, climbing the cliffs to the top where we had an amazing view of the harbour below, and the coastline to either side of us. I got more burnt and so we headed back down to get me a hat. Had a drink in the haunted Wellington Hotel's garden and then back to the hotel for our evening meal. The food was gorgeous. Graham had what he described as the best chicken he's ever eaten and I had monkfish and mussels. For start I had crab and Graham had the most delectable goat's cheese. Pudding and port were also amazing - we were very content.  Sunday - breakfast was special - eggs benedict with smoked salmon. Yummmmmmy! Graham had really hurt his toe stubbing it on the bed so we had to forget the harbour walk that we had planned. We headed off to Bude but didn't stay long after walking along to the estuary and beach as it was a bit too big and bustling. We carried on to Devon - stopping at Hartland Quay for a drink and to take in the dramatic scenery, and then onto Clovelly - which was sooooooooo quaint and cute and romantic. After stroking all the cats, twisting ankles on the steep cobbled streets, reminiscing about Graham's school trip where the tide came in and soaked his socks, and having a cream tea overlooking the harbour there we got the landrover back up to the carpark at the top (you think we were going to  walk  back up?). Then we started on the long drive home.  I can't believe how gloriously sunny it has been - and it's set to continue all week. Woohoo! I didn't want to come back from our perfect holiday away, but I think we will definitley be going back. It was a great great birthday present anyway, and one with memories that will last us a long time.

       Feeling Good   I'm actually very nervous - butterflies in my stomach. The package is sitting next to me, ready for the Parcelforce man to take this afternoon. My confidence in Parcelforce was not helped yesterday when a man turned up at 3.45 saying that he had come to collect a parcel - "No, that would be tomorrow you're supposed to pick it up - the 13th May" I said, "Ah, OK" he said. He didn't look at me the whole time - he had a bad squint in both eyes...  Well at least he turned up at the right location between the right hours - I guess that I can be thankful for that. He didn't seem to have the label he was supposed to bring though.  I feel like I am spending the last few hours with my daughter before she leaves home to move in with the local bad guy.  Looking forward to a long relaxing weekend - I hope the weather is nice in Cornwall so we can go for lots of romantic walks. I think the hotel is going to be nice too.  And looking forward to a nice meal out tonight. Graham suggested that we go out for a couple of drinks first (the table is booked for 8) but I said I'd rather crack open the bubbly at home and celebrate the sending off of the application.  Joined a new website thing last night -  urlLink nationsreunited.com  - sort of like friends reunited but for contacting people all over the world. Might come in handy - get a few canadian contacts...

       Stress  I found my stess threshold last night and then went way above it.  But more about that later.  First - the weekend (is it really Wednesday already?). Short because there's nothing to report. I wasted it - spent a lot of time catching up on my sleep as I felt exhausted. Went shopping for loads of spices so I could make a proper curry from scratch - which turned out quite tasty in the end though not saucy enough. It rained quite a bit and the Grand Prix sucked big time. Button buggered up qualifying so started 14th and only managed to get up to 8th by the end. There was hardly any overtaking. Montoya went out with failed brakes. Schumacher won yet again, even though he had a problem with his exhaust - it just wouldn't break enough to slow him down.  Mum rang from Brisbane and they really liked it there. They were looking forward to Cairns and their trip on the Great Barrier Reef.  I was in a foul mood after the Grand Prix and just wanted to get out of the house. We walked around the Downs for a couple of hours or so and to Whiteladies Road, we ate ice cream, I drank Sprite. Nothing Graham could do would cheer me up, even his offer of one of my birthday presents early. I tried to get him to stop bothering as it wasn't worth it. The curry making cheered me up a bit. We watched Frequency and it was OK but the ending was abismal. Blurgh.  I went to bed and woke up feeling much happier the next day. So Monday was a normal not-much-happening day - I was quite cheerful throughout. Nothing of note happened.  So back to yesterday. As I have put most of this application together on my own, with Graham just doing little bits that I have told him we needed, I had asked him to get in contact with a collection/delivery service to courier it to London. When I got home last night, he said that he didn't have time as he wanted to do a couple of things around the house, eat some dinner and cut his hair before he went round to his brother's where he was going to stay the night....therefore he wanted me to ring them.  Now this pissed me off because I'm sick to death of the application and whilst I understand that he has been doing a fair bit around the house recently and he doesn't have as much time free at work as I do, I really wish he'd have been more involved in the whole process - since it is a huge life-changing thing that will affect both of us so much. Instead he just left it to me the whole time and I have been getting more and more stressed as it has gone on. Also, I didn't want to phone anyone - I have this stupid phone phobia. He finds it a lot easier.  Anyway...I went on the Internet to check out prices from different companies and that's when the stress level went over. I spent 2 hours trying to arrange a collection and delivery online with a few different companies but I was always blocked - by the fact that the company wouldn't collect from a residential address, or if it did it had to be collected anytime after 12pm (meaning we would have to be at home all afternoon - which we couldn't do). Graham's not around today or tonight, we're busy Thursday night so can't really deliver it to any depot, and we're away from Friday through to Sunday.  In the end, I went for a parcelforce collection from my work - ordering it for Thursday afternoon so that I would have time to get suitable packaging. I am upset that we had to resort to Royal Mail after all. It was only after I had paid for it that I realised that a line of the sender's address had copied itself over to the recipient's address - and that is when I went loopy. I'd had enough and I couldn't cope anymore. Unfortunately Graham's response to my stress was to sit and be quiet and not actually pay me any attention at all. So I got more stressed because he couldn't find it in him to give me any emotional support - and ended up being really angry at him. All I wanted was a cuddle and a "there-there, don't worry about it".  I'd calmed down a bit before he went to his brother's, but only after I literally had to order him to give me a cuddle. His reaction just infuriated me so much.  Well, hopefully that will be the last of the stress now - assuming that Parcelforce turn up on time in the right place tomorrow, scribble out the wrong line of address, manage not to lose or damage the parcel and get it delivered to the High Commission before 12pm like we've asked them to do.  Graham's taking me out for a birthday meal tomorrow night so I will be double celebrating my birthday and finally getting that damned application out of my hands - I never want to see it again! I'm sure I will get very drunk and we probably won't get to Cornwall as early as I'd hoped on Friday, but never mind.  Graham's bro is driving supercars in Leicestershire today - Dodge Viper, Mercedes SL55, Lamborghini, Noble, Lotus Exige - it was his 30th birthday present from all of us. Graham has now decided that he'd like a Ferrari or Formula 1 day for his 30th next year, just at the time that I decided on a totally non-car related present instead - so it's tough luck, he'll have to get his bro to organise it for him or wait until his 40th! I know he will love my present anyway.

       New concept  I thought I'd try something new today - doing lots of work  before  surfing the web! It worked for a while there. I'm actually more bored surfing than I was working, so I'll probably keep this short.  I wonder if my brother had a nice time in Africa? He won a safari holiday at work for being such a good worker (obviously doesn't take after me then, or maybe he enjoys his job) - 1 week of being pampered in luxury accommodation and seeing all the wild animals, but I haven't heard from him since he got back, and neither has my Gran...  Ho hum.   I'm liking the fact that it is Friday but as I haven't got anything planned I'm not looking forward to the weekend as such. Does that make sense? It's not like I'm not looking forward to it, but I'm not getting my normal Friday buzz. Graham is working tomorrow morning...booooo...and also on call - so I don't think we'll be doing much of anything except checking over the application one last time and signing everything). The Spanish Grand Prix is on Sunday (which is unfortunate since that is the only forecasted sunny(ish) day of the weekend but we can go out afterwards) but Ferrari (read Schumacher) are set to dominate again. I have the feeling that I will be doing a lot of reading and Graham will be doing a lot of Xbox playing. It's the last free weekend in May though, so I guess we should be making the most of the chance to relax.   Graham didn't say goodbye to me yesterday morning which made me sad. And then he emailed to say that he had to go to work at 3am on my birthday so I will be waking up all on my ownsome, which made me sadder. But there's not a lot he can do about that so it's no use being upset about it. I just hope he isn't so tired that he can't enjoy the meal in the evening, but hopefully he should be able to come home about 12pm and get some kip.

       The importance of being paranoid   Eek. We haven't got the application sent off yet because Graham hadn't received his marksheet for his HND. Everything else is ready and waiting to go. I thought I'd use the extra time to go even more thoroughly through the application to make sure we hadn't missed anything and I found:  The banker's draft had been made out to The Receiver General OF Canada, rather than the Receiver General FOR Canada - if we had sent it off like that, it would have been returned toute suite and probably only in a flimsy envelope via Royal Mail's economy class.  Graham had also been claiming that he had been working in his current more senior position for a year longer than he has - so all the forms he had filled in, and his CV, did not tally with the reference letter from his company. If I hadn't have noticed that then we would have been in big trouble - with glaring errors like that on an application form they might have had us put down as lying little toerags and rejected us immediately.  So I made changes to all the forms, and Graham got onto the bank, managed to convince them that it was their fault and so another bankers draft is being written. Unfortunately that won't get to us until at least next Monday. Meanwhile, Graham's transcript is finally ready for him to pick up today. So we WILL get this application sent off next week, before the validity of the police certificates expires.  I'm glad I'm a panicker and a quadruple-checker, that's all I have to say.  Bank Holiday was so wet, apart from a very sunny Sunday which took everyone by surprise. It was lovely - we wandered all over Clifton, exploring all the little alleyways. We discovered a few bars, pubs and cafes that looked well worth a visit and had a great roast lunch at the Hop House. Also over the weekend we went to see Eternal Sunshine (which was fantastic - so beautifully shot, an interesting plot, very Charlie Kaufmann), and Kill Bill 2 (which had me fidgeting in my seat somewhat - it was pretty good but not a patch on the first one), and we went out for a mini pub crawl down St Michael's Road and a curry at the Triangle. Once again it was empty and Naz sat down and had us chatting for aaaaaaaages, mostly about relationships this time.  Delivered the hoover to Kerrianne on Monday and met Tristan, who seemed a nice chap, and had my first taste of Easton. It's more like London around that area, with a great community feel - it's mainly Asian, Middle-Eastern and Afro-Caribbean. We went to the Sweet Mart to get me some kaffir lime leaves, but ended up buying all sorts of things and spending £25. Oops.  My debit card for our joint account expired and they haven't sent me a new one, even though they sent Graham his weeks ago. Boo to Halifax.  Graham has been well tired this week unfortunatley. Neither of us has been sleeping well.  I'm trying to think of very special non-Ferrari related things for his 30th birthday since he confessed that whilst he'd love to have a Ferrari to himself for the day, he'd be paranoid about pranging it and clocking up a few grand on his credit card to pay for it. I've got 2 very good ideas at the moment, but I'll have to wait till later in the year before I can decide on what to do for him  Meanwhile my birthday is coming up very soon. Graham is taking me away to Cornwall next weekend, and taking me out for a romantic meal somewhere in Bristol (I have an inkling of where but I'm not going to say until I find out), and buying me a necklace. We went to the mall at the weekend and I pointed out some that I liked, so he is going to go back and pick his favourite of the bunch. I bought a cheap one from Next to tide me over. I've had a naked neck since I lost Graham's original necklace he bought me for our first Xmas together - it was a really nice white gold and pink sapphire one and I was gutted when I realised it had fallen off, somewhere en route to work.  Mum and Dad are in Brisbane now. Only 2 weeks left of their holiday - it's unbelievable how fast time goes. They will be back in time to come to Bristol for my birthday - we are going out for a meal on the Wednesday evening, and then I am taking the Thursday off to spend some time with them and catch up on all the news.

       Cannonball  Keep getting Damien Rice's Cannonball going through my head, and it even makes me hum and sing out loud sometimes. But it's a beautiful song, so I don't mind too much. Better than all the crap I've had in my head recently - I always seem to get stuck with 80's/90's novelty songs like startrekking or They Might Be Giants songs.  Graham seems a little chirpier now, hopefully he has started to get himself out of the rut. Trouble is, I get really down if he's down because I feel so useless. We're going into town tonight to play pool and listen to live jazz at one of our new favourite pubs - urlLink Horts . Has a nice ambience there and hopefully we should have a chilled out and happy night and Graham can drink his Waggledance.  I'm quite tired today - have been going to bed late recently and it's finally catching up on me. Just as I was being a wise-arse and telling Graham that I feel more alive if I don't sleep my 8 hours a night.  Ralf Schumacher has got two fractured vertabrae so will probably be out for 3 months now - the rest of the season. There is great speculation on who will take his place. I want Gene to have a go, as he's been test driving for Williams for yonks, and he did a good job in the one race he drove last year when Ralf was out with an injury - he came 5th. But if Ralf is out long term then they might get someone else in to do the job - probably the person who is going to take his job when he moves to Toyota next year.  I'm cold. It's gonna pour down soon. I'm hoping for some thunderstorms myself!

       Woo hoo, woo hoo hoo  And I haven't written this blog for a week why? Because I've been lazy and also haven't had much going on.  England won against Croatia in their best display of football for years, but then lost to Portugal in the quarter-final because they played like schoolkids. The ref was a nightmare official, but the England lads only have themselves to blame at the end of the day. Beckham needs to sort his head out by the time the next big tournament comes around. Now I'm gunning for Czech Republic or Holland to win, as I get a meal out paid for by Graham if they do - courtesy of a little bet we made at the beginning of the tournament.  Tim Henman is playing good tennis - could this be his year? Depends on the quality of play of the other top seeds. He'll be lucky if he can get past Roddick and Federer. I've turned into a bit of a tennis nut myself since the weekend as Graham bought Top Spin for the Xbox and I've been playing on it loads. I've won all the pro-am tournaments and got up to the heady heights of world no. 9 before losing out in the semi-final of my first major tournament and slipping down to no.13.  Had a pretty boring weekend. Went shopping on Saturday and got really wet. Bought a shirt and jeans and the Evanescence CD which has one beautiful track on it - My Immortal. Finally got around to watching Magnolia which was overlong but generally a good film. Graham thought it was pants, but then he is the biggest film grumper around. In fact there isn't much at all that will please him at the moment as he is on a real downer, just disatisfied with everything. He's turning into me far too quickly, I need to stop him quickly!   Went out for lunch with mum and dad on Sunday as they were housesitting in Olveston but was all distracted because Graham got called out just as we left the flat. He managed to eat something before getting the phonecall to say that it was critical enough for him to have to go in - meaning a drive to completely the other side of Bristol to where we were.  I had to go to the docs for some tests yesterday - they ended up taking FIVE vials of blood from me, the vampires. I don't expect anything nasty to come up, but the doc wants to rule out all possibilities before referring me to a specialist. I got into work at 10.45 only to find that Sue had phoned in sick so poor old Julian was on his own all morning, so it was just as well he didn't have meetings to go to.  Life is about to get more hectic this month. This week is pool and jazz on wednesday, curry and beer with Graham's work on friday, Jon's (grumpy pants as it's his 30th) birthday meal on saturday. Next week is my work do on Friday, a visit to Rolls Royce for an open day on Saturday. The week after is a steam train dinner up in Loughborough on Saturday, prob Hereford to see Graham's mum on Sunday. Then there's a weekend free to rest, and the last week in July we're off up north to visit Ade and Sheila for the weekend. Hopefully all that will get Graham's spirits up, if it doesn't wear him out...

       I wanna go home  and I have done since I got to work this morning. Probably before that actually. Last night I didn't sleep very well cos I kept dozing off and having these really vivid hallucination type "dreams" and waking up with a start. On more than one occasion I spoke or laughed and woke myself up. After one of these episodes Graham was going to comfort me because he thought I'd had a nightmare, but I'd just woken up laughing because Graham was wearing some silly clothes in my dream and was acting a goon.  I was naughty on Friday night and went out on the piss, with not much money. Now I am more broke than ever. I only have £20 in my current account until Friday. But it was a fun night out. We started out as usual in Wetherspoons for cheap drink (and their 2 meals for £5.75 offer) and football, then we went down to the Bristol Ram which used to be our favourite pub Le Chateux. It's still pretty similar but now brown and cream instead of yellow. Then we went to The Hatchet to see some goths and punks, then on into town to the Old Duke to catch some trad jazz. After that had finished we walked aimlessly towards the old part of town, and accidentally went into a gay bar down there, which to Graham's horror was also a (bad) karaoke night. Unfortunately we had got the drinks in before we realised so we had to stick with it. I laughed and evilly left Graham to his own devices for about 10 minutes whilst I went to the loo. When I came back he seemed desperate to snog me to prove his straightness to all those in the room, not that anyone had taken the blindest bit of notice of him - that was funny.  We ended up in the Tantric Jazz Cafe very late so got in free. We didn't stay very long because the bottle of house wine we'd bought was disgusting (and pricey too) and we'd had enough anyway. As proved when Saturday saw us lying in bed most of the day trying to catch up on our sleep and hydration.  Had a nice day for Father's day with dad, mum and Neil. The meal wasn't as good as expected but it didn't matter too much. Caught some jazz and sun at the Old Duke, went to Horts but missed their jazz session and then took them all for a little tour of historic Bristol.  US Grand Prix was a weird one. Only 8 finishers. Minardi got a point, Sato got his first podium and we thought Ralf Schumacher was gone for a while there after his crash - he didn't move for a good 3 minutes. He's apparently not too badly injured though - lots of bruising and concussion but nothing serious.  Croatia v England footie tonight. It's going to be a nail biter, as England need to draw or win to get through to the quarter-finals.  Wimbledon started today. Just when the weather is getting crap - typical!

       Fantastic viewing!  Last night's TV was brilliant - England beating the Swiss 3-0 followed by France nearly losing to Croatia followed by the biggest brawl in entertainment television ever. Big Brother was hilarious, everyone was laying into each other and security had to go in and separate them all, locking Emma up in the bedsit in solitary confinement. I don't like any of them in there, so the more fighting the better in my opinion.  The weekend has come around quick this week and you won't see me complaining. Though I am being a sad muppet and staying after work to write this, but I will be off in a minute. Got an easy weekend planned - doing nothing much tomorrow, and on Sunday my parents and brother are coming down so we can take Dad out for Father's Day - we're going to watch some lunchtime jazz down the pub and have something to eat somewhere. Whether Graham joins us or not depends on whether he thinks it will be worthwhile going to Castle Coombe on his own in the rain to watch the Formula 3000.  F1 on again this weekend - Indianapolis. I wish I could say that I won't bother watching it, but I can't....I'm addicted.  Today Kerrianne and I thought that the work experience boy was very sweet and cute, and then I found out that he was only 15 so am feeling ashamed! I'm as bad as all those blokes fancying Matilda in Leon and Hermione in Harry Potter.

       I'm working, I'm working!  Aside from the meeting I accidentally missed this morning (though the minutes tell me that I didn't miss anything at all really) I have been having a full-on working day for a change. I have enough things on to keep me busy, rather than just trying to look busy. I'm quite enjoying the responsibility. Feel like a go-getter at last (even if it is only going getting students to return their books before they graduate).  We went to an art exhibition on Monday night. Sounds posh yeah? Well, in reality it was an art exhibition by some college students so the quality wasn't all that great. The photography and graphic design was by far the best section, and Sheree's nude photography was some of the best there (the other 3 catching my eye were a collage of a hundred cafe photos, a Bristolian student interpretation of the 7 deadly sins, and some shots of local cathedrals and churches taken through a pinhole camera and presented on huge screens to stunning effect). Sheree was lapping up all the attention, and Graham was very pleased to single out "the bum" (the model that Sheree used for her shots) from the milling crowd.   As Sheree says, now it's my turn - this all came about from a drunken night a couple of summers ago when I was trying to inspire her, her daughter and myself to live the creative dream. Sheree was to market and sell her photography, her daughter (a hairdresser) was to get a job at Vidal Sasoon and I had to write a novel. Since then, she hasn't sold any work but has completed a foundation photography course and is in the process of marketing her stuff, the daughter (I forget her name dammit) went off and got a fairly good hairdressing job only to give it up to become a pole dancer, and I....Well I started a distance writing course and promptly stopped after assignment 3 after criticism from my tutor and moving house and going on holiday and applying for Canada combined to distract me too much. I haven't written anything since, apart from this blog. I know I need to get back into the course, but I'm fed up of researching magazines in order to write articles for them - it takes up so much time, and I don't have THAT much to spare. I'm hungry to get onto some fiction writing to tell the truth - something a bit more creative and less restrictive, as I can write about what I want rather than what the publisher wants. Hey, maybe I can suggest that to the tutor...  I was off ill yesterday. Went home early on Tuesday with this blimmin' bladder infection again, but I left it too late to take a pill so the effects lasted into Wednesday when they usually would go away after one night. Tried to catch up on my sleep but my dozing was interrupted by Sharma opening the squeaky door downstairs about a hundred times.  England vs Switzerland in the footie tonight - we've got to win to stay in the chance to qualify for the quarter finals so it'll be tense stuff. Switzerland are definitely the underdogs but they managed a draw against Croatia, and underdogs seem to be doing quite well in this tournament so far - take a look at Greece! It starts at 5 so we might go down the pub and watch it straight after work.  I have practically run out of money this month due to buying too many unecessary things and going out a lot. I can't believe I bought even MORE books - even though I have 8 or 9 from the previous shopping spree that I haven't read yet. I bought Tim Winton's Cloudstreet after a recommendation from Anthony, my email buddy, and also JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas (well I've wanted it for ages and it was about £7 off) and Tony Parson's Man and Boy for Graham.

       Coolio  Had a very nice weekend thank you very much!  There was so much going on that it was hard to decide what to do - how much sport do you need in one weekend? There was motoracing - F1 GP, Moto GP, BTC, Le Mans and practically everything else other than Rally, football, tennis finals, rugby, cricket...We settled for watching both the grand prixs and the England footie match (all on Sunday).   Friday night was a fairly nice night out and we ate at Tootsies. Somehow Jeff managed to eat a starter, a giant double burger (I just about finished my single burger once I had removed the top bun) and then a pudding as well, washed down with a fruit smoothie. I was in awe. Everyone really liked the food, and it was good to see Hing again - and he finally has a girlfriend! Saturday night Graham and I went out for dinner and onto The Fleece where we went to see a gig by Gee Baby I Love You - a 10 piece jazzy soul funk group. They were really good (from what I can remember, I was very drunk and probably in a hypnotic dancing trance) - very entertaining in a Commitments style way. They were supported by Funkenstein - who were possibly even better than the main act, but it was only three quarters of the way through the set that I realised..."hang on, that one's got boobs, and that one is showing her bra off, and the big singer bloke now that he has taken his cap off is, in fact a woman. In fact they're all women. duh." They made for very convincing men though - they were more butch than most men I know. Whilst at the gig we met some very strange local characters, some very weird Americans and I nearly got into a fight after (purposefully)nearly tripping up some prat who thought he owned the dancefloor and was bumping into everybody.  We also went to a motor show on the Downs on Sunday - lots of very nice old cars, and very nice newish sports cars, and some atrocities and other weird things. I ate junk all day and felt bad. Ah well, some sort of diet beckons now...

       Friday feeling  It's Friday tra la la la la. It is also Canadian Grand Prix weekend AND the start of Euro 2004 - so we get to watch Engerland getting trounced by the French, but I'll still be cheering for them anyway.  It's not sunny today, which is a huge pain as it's the first day I have ventured out without a long sleeved top or a jacket at my disposal - and I'm a bit chilly to tell the truth.   Going out later to meet up with Graham's friend Hing-Yu and probably some others - should be a good night, get some tasty grub in. Graham's just bought a load of wine so it's a shame not to be drinking that tonight - but I'm sure we'll manage to get through it tomorrow and Sunday.  I'm feeling a bit listless so I'm going to make some lists...  Things that I love: Graham My parents Cats Sushi Books Travel Mountains Lakes Ocean The moon The stars  Foods that I am or have been addicted to: Olives Sushi Pistachio nuts Halloumi cheese Salmon and Broccoli burgers from the mobile fishmongers Mint viscount biscuits Seafood crepes Chinese curry Indian curry chocolates macaroni cheese dried spaghetti  Foods that I miss as they don't make them any more: United bars with the honeycomb pieces in the chocolate Roast Beef flavoured monster munch before they changed the recipe and made them smaller. Spicy tomato Wotsits Applause bars Quattro (the drink) This isn't a very good list  Favourite cities/towns: Vancouver Sydney San Francisco Queenstown Edinburgh Brighton  Places I haven't visited yet that I must: Ireland Iceland Parts of US - specifically New York, New England, New Orleans, Washington DC, Montana, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Alaska Peru Thailand Vietnam China Scottish Highlands and many more but I have to go and do some work now...

       Booooooooring  That's what my blog is. I don't seem to be doing much random musing - I didn't mean for this to become quite so diary-like.  Al rang me from Thailand today and we spoke for a good half hour (was I supposed to be working - yes - but I hid out in the dusty old stack room where no one could see me). I miss him loads. It was so good to hear his voice and to realise just how chilled out he is - it's looking like he might quit work when he gets back and start up a new venture where he can be more hands-on and creative. He is currently on an island with only him, his sister and a couple of cooks, within walking distance of a small town (about 8 buildings) where they go to eat at people's houses some nights. He is so in love with the Thai culture - he has so much respect for them and their way of life. He has to go to Malaysia to renew his visa at some point so he might check out that side of the border. He is also hoping to head to the more volatile south (having been told by locals that the fighting has all been Thai on Thai rather than Muslim versus westerners).  His money is running out faster than he thought, so he's probably going to head home a month early with a stop in Dubai on the way back. I have asked him to come and stay with us in Bristol for a while, at least a couple of days, when he returns. I could use some of his inspiration to give me a good kick up the arse. I have no motivation left at all these days - I think this job has drawn it all out of me. Maybe time to look for another, but the money is so good here and it will look good for my CV if I stay in one place for a while rather than hopping around all over the place like I have previously done...  Did I mention that the Flames lost in the final game of the Stanley Cup finals? Glad I didn't stay up to watch that on Monday night - I stayed up for Saturday's game (Flames only had to win that game and they would have won the cup without a game 7) and was awake until 5a.m. because they went into second overtime. Yawwwn. It was a fantasticly exciting match though.  Sharma downstairs has had the doctor in again because of her high blood pressure. Before a month ago she had never needed to see a doctor - and she is 70! She is having a hard time coming to terms with Sam's new wife living with them. She has been used to having him all to herself for 30-odd years and now she has to share him and her space with Annamika. Sam tells me that Annamika is settling in OK, but with no family or friends in the country and conflict with Sharma, it must be so difficult for her. She never leaves the house apart from with him. I don't think she speaks English particularly well, so I think she should get out there and meet people in order to assimilate herself. Then what I think doesn't matter - there's obviously a whole load of stuff I don't know, and I don't know crap about etiquette in arranged marriages either, so I guess I'm one of the least qualified people to pass opinion on the matter!  Voting today for the European elections. I've already voted by post. Hope Tony gets a good old slap in the face, I'm thinking with some sort of large fish (but at the same time I hope BNP and UKIP don't get any seats, but that's wishful thinking).  Saw a really depressing film last night about a Russian girl whose mother leaves her to run away to America with her boyfriend, leaving her on her own in a flat which her aunt then kicks her out of. So she's living in this hideous dump of a bedsit with no money and no electricity and only an 11 year old boy as her true friend (her other "real" friend made out that she was a prostitute so the whole community disowned her). At a loss of anything else to do (having no education and social services not looking out for her) she does prostitute herself a couple of times for some money. Then she meets a guy who says he is going to save her and take her to Sweden to live with him and get her a job, but he sends her off to Sweden on her own to be met by his boss who promptly locks her up in a flat day and night only to let her out in order to service his clients who are into young girls and take all the money. She tries to run away, he beats her up, you get the picture. And you know this is happening all over the world as we speak. As I say - thoroughly depressing.  And on that light note I am off to cook the boy some dinner. Not cook the boy for dinner - not like the story in the news of a guy finding the dismembered remains of his daughter-in-law whilst going to the fridge to get some milk when visiting his son's house and waiting for him to return. Ick.

       Dang  I don't seem to have any time to write what I want in this thing at the moment. Keeping myself busy at work to avoid the boredom and also getting distracted by other things.  Had a good weekend. Went to see the Lion King at IMAX which was very cute. I hadn't seen the film in 5 or 6 years so there were a few surprises in there along with all the stuff I had remembered - it's THE definitive Disney old-style animated (ie not Pixar) film I think. The only film that comes close is Aladdin.  Made some food and had a picnic up on the Downs on Saturday evening. We ate and drank and talked and read and practically fell asleep in each others arms until it got to 10pm and the dew started to settle on us making us feel too cold to stay out any longer. On Sunday we had a big BBQ at Ade's house and ate like pigs the lot of us. Ade with his new girlfriend and rather drunk was a tad hyper. Well I think they are officially boyfriend and girlfriend now anyway. There was certainly a lot of canoodling going on!  The weather has been gorgeous - it's the hottest day of the year today and feeling a bit muggy out, so I am relieved that it will be cooling off but still staying above average temperature for the rest of the week. Add a nice breeze, I'll be happy!  Have just become a member of the forum on the new-style Michael Marshall Smith website so have been chatting with some like-minded fans. I've realised that he has brought out an extended selection of his short stories so I will be buying that at some point as I have nothing else of his left to read apart from those - and it's bound to be another couple of years at least before the next novel comes out.  I am distressed at how much I am enjoying Big Brother this year. I thought I would hate all of them, but it turns out I just hate half of them. Dang.

       Ahhhhhchoo!   It's 3pm and I'm going home in a minute. Not because I am ill but because I have some lieu time to take. The title of this post is referring to the annoying world of hay fever suffering. My eyes are itching, my nose is tickling and I feel all stuffed up. But hey, I love summer and I don't mind so long as it's sunny. Antihistimines here I come.  Last night was OK - I didn't stop drinking after 3 drinks because I wasn't drunk. 6 drinks in 5 haunted pubs, I didn't see any ghosts, and went back home on the happy side of drunk. Found some nice pubs that we didn't know about and that we will certainly be visiting again.  I have served a total of 3 people today - really makes me feel needed! I have been on the Lonely Planet Thorntree most of the day, discussing literature and famous movie quotes, reminding myself how much I love Michael Marshall Smith and the film Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  We are not going anywhere this weekend. Well nowhere outside the locality anyway. We are in agreement that we don't want to sit around the house. We will probably go to The Tantric Jazz Cafe tonight for a meal and drinks and tunes, then tomorrow go for a walk around the Leigh Woods area, maybe go and see the Lion King at the IMAX with Graham's bro, maybe have a picnic on the Downs. I'm sure we'll find something interesting to do on Sunday as well. We were thinking of going to Bath but it will be busy because of the fringe festival that's on there at the moment.  Well, that's me off then. Have a good weekend, one and all.

       Oh dear  I've been a bit awful at updating this again. Must try harder.  It's me Nan's birthday today. I would like everybody to join in on wishing her a happy birthday!  I've been in one of those bored trances all day - where you can't do anything to remedy the boredom because you've just gone over the edge into random staring-at-the-wall territory, thinking thoughts that you can't remember if you try to think of them a second later. Sort of like I've been dozing awake.  So what's new? Not a lot. Had a pleasant weekend - Saturday I worked in the morning, played Boules on the Downs with Graham and won, played Boules on the lawn outside our flat and lost (I obviously have a better aim in the rough when I can't actually see where the jack is but have to approximate its whereabouts). Graham was ill in the night, either from the curry we had for dinner or the houmous he had for a snack later on (greedy bugger).  Ade and Sheila came to visit on Sunday and we drank champers and went to The Clifton Sausage, where we ate sausage (unsurprisingly) and champ with onion gravy. Ade, Sheila and I shared ours so we had one each of Beef and ale, Pork, cider and mustard and Chicken, ginger and coconut - and they were all scrummy. Was good to see them, as we haven't seen them together since last November. They stayed over and we had a game of boules with them in the morning before they left. I think Sheila won but nobody remembered to keep score. When they left, Graham and I went out on the town, but Graham only lasted 2 and a bit pints and a cooked breakfast before he was tired and wanted to go home - which was OK by me as I was nackered as well.  Alex texted me from Thailand yesterday - it was good to hear from him, however brief. He was treating himself to a night in a hotel room and had seen the news for the first time since leaving in early May. It's a shame he can't get to email much as I'd love to hear about all his experiences.  As much as I like Doris downstairs, she doesn't seem to appreciate that I might be in a bit of a hurry sometimes and she always stands chatting to me for ages. Last night after a long conversation I offered to get her some things from the supermarket as we were going for a big shop. On returning at about 8pm I knocked on her door to give her her things and she made me go in and kept chatting and chatting and I felt bad that Graham was left taking all the shopping bags upstairs but I couldn't get away - I kept telling her that I'd better help, but every time I started walking off she would come after me and because she didn't have her stick she nearly fell over a couple of times and then I felt really guilty. By the time I had got upstairs, unpacked the shopping and cooked dinner it was gone 9pm. Ah well, she's not going to be around for ever so I suppose I should just appreciate her company whilst we have it.  Tomorrow night we are going out on a haunted Bristol pub crawl - visiting 8 supposedly haunted pubs in about 3 hours. I've got a feeling that we might not get to all of them, and I'm going to have to stop drinking after about 3 drinks anyway as it's part of mine and Graham's new agreement - when one of us gets drunk the other needs to cut back a bit and stay more sober, otherwise we tend to rub each other up the wrong way which leads to silly arguments that should never happen. Being one of Graham's work dos and a schoolnight anyway, I am quite happy to be the one not entering paraletic stage tomorrow.  We may be going to Devon this weekend but it hasn't been decided yet as although I have found 2 fairly cheap places to stay (1 in Torquay and 1 in Babbacombe) at last minute, I haven't been able to canvas Graham for his opinion as he left his mobile at home this morning and has been out on the road all day - he might decide he doesn't want to go after all if his worries about the price of petrol get any worse...   The new Big Brother is going to get on my nerves until someone tells that stupid Kitten to stop spouting so much crap unless there is a point to it all. Attention seeking little idiot. I feel sorry for her poor girlfriend - she must be so embarassed.

       That was the week that was  So you now know about the roast dinner-related events of the week. The rest has been fairly normal. Mum and Dad came to visit briefly on Saturday on their way back from Devon and we went out for lunch at the Italian across the Downs leaving Graham behind (at his own request) to watch the F1 qualifying and finish decorating the lounge.   Graham has done a good job with the decorating - the lounge and hall are now magnolia and will look great once we have all the pictures we want on the walls. The next step is fitting laminate flooring throughout those two rooms. Graham has got addicted to ebay and has been buying brass switches and sockets to replace our standard white ones, and he has also been bidding for spotlights for the kitchen and navy blue throws to cover our sofa and armchair, and other things like a case for his new camera and a CD for his brother etc etc etc. He seems to always be on the internet now checking whether we've won bids.   Jenson Button drove the race of his life on Sunday to come from 13th on the grid to 2nd by the end of the race. What made it most astonishing was the fact that he was only 8 seconds behind Michael Schumacher&nbsp;at the end, who had started on pole. There is no doubt that if he had not had to have an engine change on Friday and lose 10 places on the grid, he would have been racing MS for the lead all the way through, and probably would have been ahead by the end of the first round of pitstops.   We went to see Farenheit 9/11 on Tuesday night. I found it rather depressing as we see all this crap happening and yet can't do anything about it. We just have to sit here in the UK and hope that the Americans get wise to the loser that is their president come voting time. Not that I particularly like John Kerry from what I've seen of him, but anyone must be better than the purely business-minded, profit-hunting, war-mongering idiot that they've got now.   The film wasn't all that great - I guess it reinforced my opinion on Bush by showing me some things I didn't know, but I don't think that it was as effective and thought-provoking a film as Bowling for Columbine. I was outraged at some parts of it, saddened at others but you got the feeling that Michael Moore was just sniping and trying to be snide and clever, rather than actually caring about the cause like he did with Columbine. And Iraq wasn't the lovely place that he tried to show it as being before the war - the Iraqi's have had such a crap time of it whoever has been controlling their country. And I couldn't feel particularly sympathetic towards the American woman who lost her son in Iraq as before he died she was so "pro-war, pro-America, I'm really proud our family has such a military tradition" and afterwards she was more "Bush is a bastard for taking us to war for no reason, my poor poor son died for nothing". Fair enough she lost a son for a not particularly just cause and she is heartbroken, but had her son not died I think she would still be telling everybody how proud she was of him being in Iraq and getting rid of the evil dictator.   Went to see Doris last night as we have been promising for ages to go and see her and never seem to find the right time. We had a drink with her and she was really pleased to see us. Our half-hour visit turned into an hour and a half!&nbsp;I still can't get over how spritely she is at her age - apart from dodgy legs and some dodgy hearing at the moment she's in such good health.   We're off oop north to see Ade and Sheila this weekend, leaving after work today. We're taking our keg of beer with us for the BBQ we've planned for tomorrow night. It's forecasted to be a sunny warm weekend so we have lucked out again. We will be walking in Castleton in the Peak District during the day tomorrow which should be great as it's supposed to be one of the prettiest villages around that area and we have the added bonus of visiting some of the famous caves there. I'm really looking forward to it. I shan't wear my new trainers I've decided as I need to break them in&nbsp; a bit more before tackling 5KM hikes!

       That roast dinner fiasco Uh-huh.   Now let me tell you the reason why I needed to make a roast dinner this week.   It was Sunday afternoon, the GP had fininshed, and Graham had been on call all week but had Sunday off. We decided to go into town and drink beer at Zero Degrees - the new microbrewery pub. After a pint each (one pilsner, one special - which that day was mango and very delicious) I was feeling rather tipsy as I hadn't eaten much all day, so I said to Graham that we should go eat before drinking anything else and that he should choose as I really wasn't bothered as long as it was food.   Graham decided he wanted a roast dinner from Wetherspoons and I reluctantly agreed. We got there only to be told on ordering our food that they had run out of all roast dinners - even nut roast. So began a 45 minute hunt round the city centre for&nbsp;a place which did roast chicken or turkey. We rushed about to no avail as hardly any restaurant or pub were doing roasts, and if they did it was beef or lamb. Eventually I suggested we go to the Beefeater the other side of the river and they did have a board outside saying they did roasts. We went up to the restaurant and asked the waitress if they had any roasts left, and she said no, oh, yes but only turkey. Graham said fine, table for 2 please. We ordered drinks, and I struggled to find anything on the menu that I wanted as I was dismayed that everything was expensive - no light bites. I have issues with paying lots of money for food that I don't particularly want - when I'd rather have a burger for a couple of pounds up the road.   Anyhow, I eventually ordered a starter and Graham ordered his roast and we drank our drinks. 5 minutes later the waitress comes up to tell us that there are no roast dinners available after all! Graham got frustrated and unhappy because he seemed destined not to have his roast dinner, and by now he had worked himself into such a state that nothing else was going to do.&nbsp;We left the restaurant saying that we came in specially to have the roast dinner and we didn't want anything else. I then promised Graham that I would make him&nbsp;a roast dinner during the week to make up for it. We decided just to go back to Zero Degrees and eat there, but we did stop off at one more place en-route who were offering buy one get one free roasts - and yep, yet again they had run out of chicken and there was only beef left. Graham had started to see the funny side by this point.   We ate at Zero Degrees - the starters were nice, bruschetta with practically a whole punnet of quartered cherry tomatoes on top, and doughballs with garlic butter and chilli oil. The pizzas - BBQ chicken and Goats Cheese - were pretty average. We washed that down with a pitcher of mango beer and were pretty full, but I realised if we bought one pudding between us then our food bill would come to over £25 and so we would qualify for a free 5-litre keg of a beer of our choice (normally costing £14.95)! We ordered the smallest pudding ever - a dark chocolate and cointreau grenache which turned out to be the richest pudding ever and so more than enough for the two of us. We then with big smiles on our faces ordered our 5-litre keg of mango beer (that stuff really does taste great) - only to be told that they'd run out! Can you believe it? We got a receipt though and told them we'd come back later in the week when they'd brewed some more. I picked a keg up on Tuesday - it had the wrong date on it so it looks like we nicked someone elses reserved keg, but nay mind, at least we've got it!

       I got a brand new pair of trainers  After a lot of online research and visits to Ellis Brigham (twice), Blacks and Nomad travelstore I decided not to get the Merrells that I ordered in specially because I thought the octogrip sole was going to kill me on hard wet surfaces. Instead I went for a pair of these The North Face -  urlLink http://www.ellis-brigham.com/index2.htm?http%3A//www.ellis-brigham.co.uk/outdoor_footwear_ss04.htm   I walked to work in them today and they are fairly comfortable - bit of an issue with the top of the toes but that should disappear when they've been broken in more. I shall take them with me to the Peak District this weekend to test them out on tougher terrain. Hopefully by the time we get to Canada they should feel as comfy as an extra pair of socks.  I'm cooking my first ever roast today and I must admit I'm cheating by buying ready made yorkshire puds (I don't have the necessary ovenware to cook them) and by grilling my lamb steak. I shall roast the potatoes and Graham's chicken though and I have stuffing and gravy and nice veg to go with it. I keep getting contradictory advice about the potatoes - whether to add some flour or not post-parboiling. I think I won't this time around.

       Gripe of the day  I want to buy a new pair of trainers before I go on holiday to Canada at the beginning of September. Specifically I would like a pair of Merrells or something Merrell-esque at least. Sports shops in this country don't sell those sorts of trainers, specialist outdoors shops do, but&nbsp; mainly just men's versions. I am fed up of looking and not finding!  I went online yesterday to see if I could get a pair that way. The links from the Merrell website to online distributors of their product lead me to US-only sites. UK websites that I have found on Google do sell some Merrells but the choice is really limited compared to the actual Merrell range and most of the time they don't have my size in stock.  Blogger.com is now going to take the word Merrell and stick it up at the top of this page as a link. You just watch.  Anyway, I'm going shopping this weekend and if I can't find a pair I like then I will have to purchase a pair online that I've never tried on and aren't my first choice of style or colour.  Graham is moaning as he's supposed to be going on a booze cruise in August with some people at work. The trouble is it's fancy dress and the theme is "famous doubles". Since I am not allowed to go due to limited numbers and all of his workmates have already paired up and got their costumes sorted he is feeling a bit disheartened and doesn't know what to do. I suggested that he should go as Rod Hull and take a toy emu with him, but he didn't seem to fancy that idea.  It's Friday again thank god. Looking forward to a bit of shut-eye tomorrow. And hopefully the GP will be more exciting this time. I entered a competition to win tickets to the MotoGP at Donnington Park this Sunday but I assume I haven't won so we will definitely be watching the F1 instead. Might persuade Graham to go to Brandon Hill if it is nice to listen to some jazz band play before heading on to  urlLink zero degrees &nbsp;for a spot on dinner and beer.

       So...  what's been going on in my life the past couple of weeks I have been too lazy to write?  Graham and I very nearly split again, but we managed to sort ourselves out in time to celebrate our third anniversary together on July 11th. It really saddens me when we go through these rough times as I can't bear the thought of a life without him. We complement each other so well and have all these plans for our future, it just feels so right to be together. When he says that he just wants to make me happy and that I might be much happier without him, I have to try and make him see that I want to be happy  with  him, not happy without him.  We didn't do anything mad for our "anniversary", just spent the Saturday evening (10th) relaxing at home, having a bath and massage and nice food and bubbly, listening to music and snuggling and being romantic.  We have been out for 2 successful work-dos - Wetherspoons and curry with his crowd, Penny Farthing and mexican (rather more expensive unfortunately) with mine.  We have seen 2 grand prixs and been pissed off with Michael Schumacher still winning whatever happens in qualifying. We also went to Silverstone last week for a testing session - only McLaren and Jordan were there but it was still pretty special as it was the first time I had ever been close to a F1 car. My first experience of the day involved David Coulthard coming out of Bridge Corner at about 180mph - and it was an incredible buzz as even though you watch it on the telly and you know it's fast, nothing can really prepare you for the actual speed and noise involved.  I saw Matt and Sharon briefly when they came to Bristol to run their mile for Sport Aid. I caught up with Liz for the first time since Easter when I hitched a lift to Cheltenham last night with Graham and Ade who were going to visit their Grandad in hospital. We had a good old girly gossip and I'm arranging to see her and Kel for a girl's night out in August.  Have been emailing Clare and she is in the process of buying her very first place - a flat near Sainsburys on the Tewksbury Road. I'm really pleased for her as she has been wanting a place of her own for so long but never seemed to be flush enough to cobble a deposit together.  Last weekend we went up to Loughborough for Graham's steam train dinner. The railway itself was a little disappointing in the day as you couldn't get off and do anything at the stations and the scenery wasn't very impressive (apart from at the reservoir), but the evening was fantastic and very romantic. We had a 5-course meal with wine and port and it was all lovely. The staff were great (and so young and sweet that I kept wanting to pat them on the head and tell them not to worry so)&nbsp; and I even won a bottle of wine when my comment card was drawn out of a hat.   We also went to Hereford to see Graham's mum who had just run (or rather power walked) the Race for Life in such a good time that we only got there when she had finished. Had a nice day with them catching up as we hadn't seen them for quite some time.  I think that about covers it. I am feeling exhausted at the moment and am looking forward to a lie-in or two over the weekend. I was thinking about going to Cheltenham for the weekend but I think I will just stay home and rest and get my energy back for next week and our trip up north next weekend. That is unless Alex calls me and wants me to head down that way. As far as I know he got back from Thailand on Monday and is staying with his mum in Winchcombe, but I haven't heard from him yet.  &nbsp;

       I've got a new blog &nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink http://blah3blog.blogspot.com    This is in recognition of the fact that this blog has become far too diary-like and much less random musings.   Hopefully I will find time to update this blog soon, but not at the moment because I need to do some work after spending far too much time experimenting with&nbsp;colour and stuff&nbsp;on the other blog. And now I've found that  I         can do  exactly the same  on this one!

       Hurrah!  We received our AOR today! Brilliant!  I was expecting it to take 12 weeks, but it was only 8 so I'm even more chuffed. Either the High Commission have taken on some new workers over the summer or the backlog is moving along a bit for some other reason. The back of the card says that we now might not be contacted by them for 18 months, but I don't mind now that we are officially in the system and we know that they are processing our application.  They started processing it on 7th July - which just happened to be the third anniversary of the day that Graham and I first met. Ahhhhhh! Good omen? Let's hope so.

       I'm an idealist inspiration!   I have just taken the Myers-Briggs personality test and found out that my personality type is ENFP. I have never read through a description of what I am supposed to be like and nodded so much. It has helped me affirm my identity, and to realise that I am not alone in the world (although I think there are only about 8% of similar people in the world).  This is me: The Inspirer  As an ENFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system.   ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the ability to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it.   ENFPs have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most things which interest them. Project-oriented, they may go through several different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers, the ENFP may seem directionless and without purpose, but ENFPs are actually quite consistent, in that they have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their lives. Everything that they do must be in line with their values. An ENFP needs to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in step with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a continuous quest to adapt their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They're constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing touch with themselves. Since emotional excitement is usually an important part of the ENFP's life, and because they are focused on keeping "centered", the ENFP is usually an intense individual, with highly evolved values.   An ENFP needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a problem area for some of these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types, ENFPs need time alone to center themselves, and make sure they are moving in a direction which is in sync with their values. ENFPs who remain centered will usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit of dropping a project when they become excited about a new possibility, and thus they never achieve the great accomplishments which they are capable of achieving.   Most ENFPs have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in people, and place great importance on their inter-personal relationships. ENFPs almost always have a strong need to be liked. Sometimes, especially at a younger age, an ENFP will tend to be "gushy" and insincere, and generally "overdo" in an effort to win acceptance. However, once an ENFP has learned to balance their need to be true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at bringing out the best in others, and are typically well-liked. They have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short period of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their own level.   Because ENFPs live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of everyday life are seen as trivial drudgery. They place no importance on detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain oblivous to these types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most ENFPs, and can be frustrating for ENFP's family members.   An ENFP who has "gone wrong" may be quite manipulative - and very good it. The gift of gab which they are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want. Most ENFPs will not abuse their abilities, because that would not jive with their value systems.   ENFPs sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to intuitively perceive the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply judgment to their perception, they may jump to the wrong conclusions.   ENFPs who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining happy in marital relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could be, they may become bored with what actually is. The strong sense of values will keep many ENFPs dedicated to their relationships. However, ENFPs like a little excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are comfortable with change and new experiences.   Having an ENFP parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at times for children with strong Sensing or Judging tendancies. Such children may see the ENFP parent as inconsistent and difficult to understand, as the children are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the ENFP. Sometimes the ENFP will want to be their child's best friend, and at other times they will play the parental authoritarian. But ENFPs are always consistent in their value systems, which they will impress on their children above all else, along with a basic joy of living.   ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules or mundane tasks. Consequently, ENFPs work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and where they can work with people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about what they're doing.   Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, ENFPs often suffer from muscle tension. They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labelled. They need to maintain control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to themselves.   ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those near them, if they are able to remain centered and master the ability of following through.   Jungian functional preference ordering for ENFP:   Dominant: Extraverted Intuition Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling Tertiary: Extraverted Thinking Inferior: Introverted Sensing  I'm going to get Graham to take the test so that I can understand more where he is coming from. It could improve our relationship so much.  I strongly recommend anyone to take the  urlLink free test  and then read up on the personality type in depth (including suitable careers, how we deal with relationships and the best plan of action to make the most of life as a particular personality type)  urlLink here

       Canada Day  It's Canada Day today so I have been humming their national anthem to myself and thinking of ice hockey and maple syrup and cougars.  I'm kinda busting out of my shirt today - it was fine before I left home but during the day I have popped a button or two at various times. I went out for lunch with Ed at  urlLink Yiamass  and so am feeling stuffed and the buttons are popping on a more regular basis! I had the seafood spaghetti which had around 100 mussels in it, no word of a lie, a few small shrimp, a couple of tiger prawns and some squid. It was tasty and I managed to only get a little down my front, so I'm quite pleased.  Ed has got himself a teaching job in Crawley for a year so he will be staying in Brighton. He's just moved into a flat of his own after spending the year holed up in a student place, so I think he's enjoying having the place to himself. Couldn't believe how expensive it was though - and he's living in Hove, not the centre of Brighton. Hopefully get to visit him down there soon as I'd like to show Graham the place. It's another one on my list of places to live in this country if we stay.  Tim lost the tennis big stylee yesterday to the unseeded Croat who is tipped to be the next Pete Sampras. Still, embarassing to go out in straight sets when everyone is expecting you to win. Holland lost the footie, so Portugal are in the final, can only hope now that Czech Republic beat Greece tonight to keep my dreams of winning the bet alive.

       Rent  I hit upon the idea that we could sell our flat, put the capital into a high interest account, and rent something for the next 2 years so making money and getting rid of the hassle of having to sell the house when the time comes to move to Canada. Graham has worked out that he could earn £200 per month after tax by doing this and if we could rent a place that costs less per month than our current mortgage payments we'd be laughing.  You see we absoloutely adore our flat and its location, but we're scared that when the time comes to sell the flat we won't be able to sell it, or we'll make a loss on it - especially if the housing market crashes in the next 2 years, and/or we have to reduce the price in order to get a quick sale so that we can move to Canada.  We went to look at a furnished flat being offered for rent by someone at the university last night. She was offering it for £650 fully furnished from the end of October. It was fairly nicely done out, but the second bedroom was a tad on the small side, the lounge was a good size but didn't have enough room for a permanent dining table, and the location was not quite what we wanted - it would add another 15 minutes onto a walk back from town and would take even longer to walk to a pub around there.  We are trying to arrange to view a couple of flats within 2 mins walk of our flat, and I've seen one in Kingsdown that looks great. After we've seen what quality we might be able to get for our money we will probably get a couple of valuations on the flat, and then have a good hard think about it. At the end of the day we don't want to move, but as we're going to have to move anyway we might as well ensure that we don't lose money on the sale of the house, and with interest rates going up it would be preferable to be making more interest on our savings rather than shelling out more money on the mortgage each time it goes up.  We're just waiting for somebody to tell us it is the wrong thing to do. Everybody who we've asked so far seems to think that it is the most sensible thing to do.

       Do builders work?  On Monday some builders turned up, loitered around for the morning and didn't do any work. Nobody could find their foreman. When someone eventually suggested phoning him they found that he was on another job and couldn't come, so they all went home. Meanwhile we spent the morning shifting furniture and stock around to make their "job" easier.  Yesterday the builders came and loitered around all day. In the afternoon the foreman decided that we needn't fence off the whole area, just a few metres square of it - so two blokes put up some metal barriers around the area they are going to initially concentrate on. Then they went home.  Today, no one is doing anything. Again. We need a firedoor built into our library and that was supposed to be their first priority - but nobody has turned up, and nobody has told us when they intend to start. We'll only know when someone starts drilling though the wall.  I don't understand how they can get paid for not being here, or paid for being here and not doing anything. I know I have a hard time justifying my job sometimes, but at least I actually do some work each day and sometimes I do loads.  Well, let's just forget that little moan for now, it's not me paying for it, so I shouldn't really be too bothered - and when they do start working it's going to be so dusty and noisy that I'll wish they hadn't!  Had a nice time in Cheltenham over the weekend. Went out for a curry with Liz and Kel on Friday and they seemed to really appreciate having time alone with me, rather than Graham being there, or me inviting half of Cheltenham along like I always manage to do when I come back for such a short time. We went to Taylors afterwards to meet up with Liz's bloke Leeroy and friends - they have been together a year and this is the first time I've met him. People seemed to want to go clubbing, I didn't want to, but they didn't want me to go home so we ended up compromising and going to the Two Pigs instead - which turned out to be a mistake as everybody wanted to be in different rooms (there was drum and bass out the back, cheesy chart downstairs, and indie hiphop and punk upstairs) and the guys were too drunk to really enjoy any of it. Bumped into someone I really didn't want to (Abi's ex James) who insisted on buying me a drink and talking to me, but all he did was slag Kelly off so I made my excuses and gave the drink he bought me to Leeroys friend Maxi (as it was his birthday). Later on James bought Kelly a drink, possibly to apologise for being horrible to her, but she freaked out and thought he had spiked it with something (possible, he is a bit of a weird one) - so I just told her to leave it.  Saturday was a bit more civilised. Went round to have a look at Clare's flat that she moved into on Wednesday - it is very small and in a location that she never really wanted to be in, but it's all she could afford (it was £95,000 as it was). It's great that she's got a place of her own after so long and she's really pleased to have her freedom. We drove to Montpellier to visit Caz, whom neither of us had seen for 2 years. Her rented flat is lovely - right on Montpellier Park - she and Mark have bought a house near Clare and will be moving shortly, and the are also getting married next August. It was really nice to chat with her and I hope to see her again soon - we shared a bottle of wine and then I went back home to see Graham and to help mum prepare for the BBQ. It was a perfect evening for BBQing and the food we made was nice - the only problem was that next door had an 18th birthday party going on for the twins in their garden so we had to compete with their music!  On Sunday we went out to a new Thai restaurant for lunch. The inside was very well done, with a waterfall in the entrance, wood panelling, gilt and elephants everywhere. They did a brilliant buffet with a wide selection of food, really nicely presented, and the service was very attentive. We all enjoyed it, apart from the fact that most of the food was pretty spicy so there wasn't enough contrast to the chilli taste that built up in our mouths!  All in all a very pleasant weekend.

       It's hot  Very hot. And it is even hotter because this library has zero ventilation. It is hot sat at the desk by the doors with the fan on, it is even hotter when you are up a ladder deep in the bowels of the library, lifting heavy, disgustingly dusty journals from the top of the bookcases and transferring them to another room for disposal. I've been sweating my t**s off.  We're all rather panicked because building work is starting on the quad outside on Monday and as well as having no normal access to the library at very late notice, they sprung it on us that they want to start knocking through our reading room and the wall at the end of the library to put in  a firedoor on Monday as well. We knew it was coming, but a little more notice would have been nice. We now have had to move so many journals and books around to make space for the building works which are going to do away with 33 m of shelving. All in one day. Ah well, at least it has given me something to do!  Ah, the trials and tribulations of a library assistant.  Don't know if I'll be seeing much of Graham this weekend. I am going to cheltenham tomorrow night to go out with Liz and Kel whilst he goes on this booze cruise in Bristol. He is meant to join me on Saturday but I can't see him coming down before the evening as he is sure to be very hungover, and also he needs to be at the end of the phone and easily able to get into work if needed, as loads of people are working over the weekend to prepare for this big installation next week that he has been planning for months. We are going out for mum's birthday meal on Sunday lunchtime, but Graham may be called back to Bristol before then. Hopefully not.  Never mind, at least the installation is going ahead and he will be able to go on holiday to Canada and install the network rather than having to choose between the biggest thing in his career and the biggest plan in his personal life. For a while there we thought the project might be so delayed that he would not come on holiday with me!
