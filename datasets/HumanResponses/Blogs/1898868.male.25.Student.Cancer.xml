      Yo, is anyone else still putting things on here?  I've got other ideas, but if we're not going to use this anymore then I'm not going to bother putting stuff up...

      I think the villain should be someone who is into extreme sports - particularly rock-wall climbing.

      So I had to go to this workshop today on the implementation of some new PSAE test prep computer program.  I got there like 10 minutes late, and so the only computer left was one that wasn't booting properly.  But rather than make a big deal out of it, I just sat at that computer and for like an hour and twenty minutes pretended like I was typing and following all of the directions that everyone else was.  I would even make eye contact with the instructor guy and nodding my head when he asked if I was following and on the right page.  So after the hour and twenty minutes he walks behind me where he can see the computer and that it's not even turned on.  He asked if it just went out.  I said 'no.'  Then he asked if it had been off for the whole class.  I didn't know what to say, so I just said 'I guess so.' Then he just stared at me for a minute, and I don't think either of us knew what to say.  It was a pretty uncomfortable situation for both of us, and we may be able to expand on it a bit and make something funny out of it.  Also, the other day I was at this end-of-school party and there was this foreign woman there with a thick accent.  Only the accent would constantly change and sometimes seem british and sometimes french and sometimes some other shit.  I was gonna tell her that I thought she was only pretending to have an accent and that I didn't buy it, but I figured that would be rude.  But I definitely would have liked to.  Maybe some sort of situation like that could occur and one of our dudes could offend someone or something...

      At some point I figure the main characters will need to make some extra cash.  Maybe to front the money they will need to get back at the villain.  In any case, they are walking down the street one day when they notice a flyer in a storefront window offering up a reward for "information that leads to the arrest" of a criminal - probably someone who has been robbing gas stations or mugging old women.  They devise a plan to make the reward money (maybe five thousand dollars or so).  They will get jobs at a 7-11 or dress up as old women to bait the thief into attacking them.  From there, they will capture the guy and bring him to the police for the reward.  I don't know whether it would be better for their plan to work, and that they get the money, or else for it to fail miserably, and maybe they get beat up or something and the guy gets away.  Either way, I think it might be a good idea...

      So it might be funny to have a treat idea where somebody drives around town with something on the roof of their car, like a bunch of fast food or a briefcase or something, to illicit responses from the public.  Only the item(s) are not just perched up there, but are actually glued or velcroed to the roof of the car.  It could either be straightforward, or we could have a really exaggerated response, where people in the streets are going crazy and trying to help them, yelling "Dude, stop the car! You've got a happy meal up there!!" or something.  Or else that could be the treat that went too far, because someone on the sidewalk could take a step towards the car at a stoplight to warn the driver that there's something on the roof, and then that person could be hit by a car and killed or badly injured...

      -Come up with other jobs for the friends (either they could all work at the bar together, which is a mom & pop kind of place, or else one of them can work at an ice cream shop, one at an italian beef place, one as a substitute teacher, etc).  Something to think about.  -Get a feel for John's sense of humor.  I'm thinking that he's kind of the reasonable character that people will be able to connect with (ie Luke Wilson in Old School or the "main" dude in SuperTroopers)  -Add to John's bio  -Do a bio for the villain!

      Most of this stuff will NOT be in the screenplay, but it might help us all get a feel for the character and what he might do (thanks, Syd Field - I got your book in the mail today!)  -Grew up in Columbus, OH -Dad: a drafter in an engineering firm -Mom: substitute teacher -Sister: trades bonds in Manhattan  -Above average student, took honors classes, started goofing around in high school -In high school, gets into skating and punk rock music, plays the bass -Goal is to become a professional skater  -Goes to Ohio State University, after his sophomore year his sister gets transferred from a firm in Chicago to one in Manhattan.  This frees up her apartment in Chicago, where she has a lease (paid by the company) through September -John and some friends take the opportunity to spend the summer in Chicago, where they will work small-time jobs and attempt to shoot and sell a skating video  -In the meantime, John and his friends are seen by another kid their age who is an intern at a Mancow-esque radio show... they begin doing on-air stunts every once in a while for extra money  -Intern has connections to Mtv, who hears/sees them, and signs them to a contract to do a few videos... they decide to forego their junior year of college at OSU and stay for the year in Chicago.  The $$ they get from the Mtv video deal is just enough to pay for an apartment for them, so they all continue their crummy jobs (John works at a bar where they let his band play every week or so).  -After decent to low sales, the videos get shelved by Mtv  -They continue their jobs for a 2nd year, again foregoing a return to college (which he is beginning to get some pressure from his parents to do)... now he is hoping that his band is what will take off, not necessarily the skating videos  -the band is decent, but not great - he plays bass and shares the singing with another friend  -They are, however, friends with another band who DOES begin to take off.  The band is signed and asked to do a video.  They know that John and his friends are funny and have some experience with videos, so they ask them if they will star in it.  The video stars them doing stunts and maybe some tricks (getting hurt, playing jokes on each other), and the music video becomes really popular.  -Mtv execs see the video and want to know who the dudes are.  Then they find out that they actually have the dudes under a contract option to do a season show (the contract, meanwhile, was only signed by the mancow-intern/friend/future villain)  -The contract options them for 7 episodes (again, not for a lot of money - just enough for them to keep living in the apartment)... they're aired and the show is a big hit called "treat'd."  -In the last episode (the 8th?), the villain screws them, and John and the others get arrested while the villain is signed to do lead a 2nd season and make a ton of money  -Thus, the stage is set for our screenplay!!  Again, there's a lot of info here and I don't think that most of it should be in the movie, because it's all background stuff that happens way before the movie even starts.  But it's good if we can all get a feel for the characters.

      Oh yeah - and I also think it would be funny if we had a white, 25-ish year old character, who is part of the treat'd crew, and always in the background.  He has dreadlocks and wears a big rastafarian hat, and maybe is always hackey-sacking or something.

      I think we should introduce another character: The Untreatable.  He's some sort of celebrity who has become known for the show's inability to treat him.  Every time anyone has tried, he has foiled them.  Until... the villain uses the "ultimate treat" (which he stole from our characters) to treat the Untreatable.  Eventually, when our characters are trying to get back on their feet, they receive a phone call from the Untreatable, who wants to meet them in secret.  The Untreatable suggests a way to get back at the villain.  When asked how he became such an expert on treats, the Untreatable offers up a story (perfect for a montage) of how, when he was young, he was a master of treats.  The movie could then show clips of him treating his classmates/teachers/neighbors/friends as a kid throughout the 60s and 70s.  Until... the treat that went to far.  A treat of his went awry (we could think of something funny), and now he has sworn off treats.  He will not participate in this revenge treat to get back at the villain, but he will suggest a means to do it.

      So, going along with Joel's idea for the intro and a plot where the dudes want to get back at the one member of their crew who shafted them and got them arrested:  That one dude who screwed them over (dude X) has since gained tons of popularity by making famous a 'punk' that one of the other (main) dudes (or maybe all of them collectively) had devised and were planning on doing before they got arrested.  Dude X, of course, does not give dudes A, B, C, or D credit for anything.    That, anyway, would be the classic plot.  Maybe we can somehow put a twist on it to make it a little more creative.

      I’ve decided to forego sleep for but a few more moments this evening to jot a few notes on things I’ve been thinking about recently with regard to this screenwriting project of ours.  Justin, I like your ideas so far.  Too build on a couple of them…   I would like to have characters that say “dude” a lot, but I think that might be a bit too much dude, where’s my car-ish… I do however think there's something in characters who say something annoying all the time that think it's cool.  I think thats the way the MTV type of person strikes the average person, and it'd be fun to exaggerate that for our purposes.    I think there’s an idea with the “can you watch this for me”… in fact, it could provide a good start for our movie.  How about an idea where there are 4 or 5 dudes are doing this show like Jackass or whatever, and then they choose this stunt you’re talking about to do… the only thing is, the guy who is doing the initial “will you watch this for me” knows that their show is going to be cancelled, and is setting up all the other guys to go to jail so he can have his own show… The other guys go and steal whatever the 3rd party is “watching” and then some overzealous cops bust in.  Meanwhile, the 3 or 4 who are really getting arrested think they’re on punk’d (or shall we call it “treated”?) and they keep yelling, “aww hell yeah, where’s ashton?  We got treat’d!”)  But then they go to jail, xtv won’t bail them out and tell the cops it was just a show, and they have to call their girlfriends, who dump them on the way home because their show got dropped, they’re out of the limelight, and their ex-friend gets the spotlight, all their girlfriends, and a bunch of cash.  They get off but have to spend lots of cash on lawyers maybe?  Then we could have a revenge plot, get back to being famous plot, and fuck these corporate dudes who only care about money plot.  We could also work the punk band aspect as well… It’d also be fun, because as an intro we could definitely write some good shit making fun of those jackass shows, but enough so that it was original and not just satire.    Justin, I don’t know if you saw, but I left a comment on your thing about the dude with the watch dressed up as a Monopoly guy playing board games at the bar.  That really reminded me of that show on Comedy Central, trigger Happy TV, where the people dressed up in dog suits get in fights in the bar… I love that shit, and I think it goes far.  We should definitely include a few things in that vein.  In fact, I think it would be funny if these guys were such extreme stunt dudes that they found that they became unable to relate to people in their everyday lives.  Like they had to do variations on stunts just in going to the grocery store… and they realize that they are probably making asses out of themselves, but they just laugh at each other and know there’s nothing they can do about it… or they’re oblivious to their annoying nature.    I also think it would be cool if one of their side-friends (not a main character) was this totally rational, level-headed guy (different from a straight-man character, who could be a main char.) who was always saying things like, “Oh my God, are you serious?  You could seriously injure your knee doing that and there would be no way to repair it, I’ve seen it 100 times in physical therapy.”    Random idea I don’t want to forget (Characters represented as A, B, C, etc…): “A” climbs out of ridiculously tall SUV with the license plate “xtreme” and the letters “UHEV” visible next to his beer belly. A: It’s a new Ultra High Emissions Vehicle.  I also think we should write character bio’s per that book… I might try my hand at one over the next few days… make sure to buy it.    Jack, where are you!?  Get the fuck on here!

      Today at work somebody asked me to watch their laptop while they went away for a few minutes.  I kept wondering what I would do, if anything, if someone came along and just took it.  So I think it would be interesting to set someone up and see what they'd do if you asked if they'd watch something for a minute (like a bike, or whatever), walked away, and then had a friend go over and get on the bike and try to ride it away.  Also, I was riding my bike by that bar on addison where people play board games.  I thought it would be funny (or maybe lame) to walk in and try to intimidate people by wearing a three-piece suit, pocketwatch, and monocle, and challenging people to a game of monopoly.

      Every time there's even the mention of doing a group project in one of my night school classes, everyone in the class' eyes light up and people start getting really excited and looking around the room and whispering "Ooohh - we could meet at Starbucks" and "yeah! let's meet at starbucks!"  I would kind of like to make fun of them.

      As the resident tech guru, here are Justin's previous E-mails!  From:   jlessek@hotmail.com Subject: yo Date: June 13, 2004 8:04:55 AM CDT To:   navonodfj@yahoo.com, jastava@yahoo.com So I don't know if we're still planning on a blog or anything, but we could also start screenplay ideas for situations/characters/etc going via e-mail.     I was thinking about my brother and my dad and the situation with his girlfriend Lynda yesterday, and I think it would be funny if we had a 30 year old character whose father just recently re-married, and the 30-year old is all bitter about having a new mom, even though clearly he's out of the house and it hardly affects him.  The woman won't try to order him around or anything, but if she offers him something at dinner or whatever, he can get all upset like a 13-year old girl and do a big "you're not my real mom and you can't tell me what to do" thing.     So I think it would be nice (and easy) if we somehow had a plot that involved a few different people that we could loosely model after ourselves (or at least one normal guy and then a few other funnier characters a la Old School, or else one teacher, one corporate- or ex-corporate-world dude, and one military), so maybe we just need the situation.  They could either BE friends, or be thrown into some random situation where they all meet.     What do you dudes think?     J     From:   jlessek@hotmail.com Subject: more ideas Date: June 15, 2004 2:26:07 PM CDT To:   jastava@yahoo.com, jack.donovan@gmail.com I don't know what kind of ideas you guys have in mind, but it might be funny if we made fun of those JACKASS and wildboyz guys and did a movie about three dudes (we could loosely base them on us) who are like 27 years old, made a bunch of money by being on a JACKASS-style show, and then are out of jobs when the show eventually fizzles and their popularity goes down... then they're trying to figure out what they want to do.  They could all give some normal type of job a shot, and then realize that they can't do anything like that.  Meanwhile, these guys think they're awesome at music and stuff because they used to be on the popular show, so we can have them play some funny/half-sucky punk rock type songs in a band.  Eventually, they decide that because they can't make it in the real world, they need to pull off some huge stunt to get the media's attention again...  (I don't know what that stunt is, but it will be sweet.)  Just another idea...  J-boss  From:   jlessek@hotmail.com Subject: more script stuff Date: June 15, 2004 7:15:33 PM CDT To:   jastava@yahoo.com, jack.donovan@gmail.com  So the more I think about that last idea, the sweet I think it could be... In the real world, our characters could try pulling "crazy pranks" on people, but instead of everyone laughing or liking them, they would just punch them or beat the shit out of them.  Like maybe one guy is working a temp office job, and he tries to cut some dude's hair while the guy is talking on the phone or doing something, and then instead of laughing everyone just stares at him and he gets fired.  And it would also be funny to show clips from old episodes of the show (which should have a ridiculous but also plainly stupid name playing off of jackass... like 'smart-alecks' or 'jerks' or something).  The old clips can show them doing "crazy" stunts and making "crazy" faces as they jump into the camera at funny angles and do other zany things (sorry for all the quotation marks in that last sentence).  So also, the plot could be that they stage something huge to become famous again - like setting up and paying some friend to rob a bank so that they can mysteriously save the day.  They plan and plan for it, but eventually just get busted and arrested (thus, somewhat cheesily, getting the media and notoriety that they had wanted in the first place).  Just another idea...  J

      well, I sent those e-mails to you guys today from computers at school, and my hotmail doesn't save my sent e-mails for some reason, and so I don't have a copy of the ideas I mailed out.  Not a big deal, but maybe one of you could copy and paste them from the e-mail (assuming you haven't deleted such priceless stuff yet)?  Thanks, bros.  And thanks for getting this up and going, Joel!  Oh yeah - here's an idea: Joel and I were talking about all those crazy celebrities who just "love" the Los Angeles Lakers (like Jack Nicholson).  Obviously nobody takes those guys seriously, and thinks that they really give a shit.  So it would be pretty funny if when the Lakers lose one of them kills themself!

      Alright, let's get some ideas down.  It would be good if we could work in the framework provided by that book I've been talking about.  Again, it's called Screenplay by Syd Field.  Have either of you bastards bought it?  It's actually written pretty well, and it will be useful for us.  I also got some advice from some fucking hilarious writer dudes at second city, so i'll be glad to act like a know it all... ha.  Totally just kidding!   Alright, let's roll America!

I didn't realize that I would sppend so much time away form my computer/reading/writing while April was on her off black last month.  I will try to read through some stuff and give you some feedback though, bro.  Hope you're having a good time in Cali-Cali.

      The new guy has since been updated, and a rough draft of The Group Project is in the works.&nbsp; IN the meantime, a 3rd episode (possibly the intro episode) is also in the works (starts with, "cool beard."&nbsp; "Yeah.&nbsp; Thanks.").

       So, the formatting stuff didn't cross over too well, but here's a 1st draft of 'The New Guy.'&nbsp; It obviously needs lots of revisions, but here's something to work from...    &nbsp;  ------------------------------------------------------------------------    &nbsp;  FADE IN:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “the new guy”  &nbsp;  EXT. A BUILDING ON THE CAMPUS OF DEPAUL UNIVERSITY – EVENING  &nbsp;  Students wearing backpacks are entering and leaving the building.&nbsp; Others congregate in small groups on the sidewalk outside.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  INT. A CLASSROOM – WIDE ANGLE  &nbsp;  Ten to twelve students, ages ranging from 22-30 years (with one evidently older student, around 50) are talking quietly and appear to be waiting for the professor.&nbsp; Desks are set up in rows.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON SPENCER CODY  &nbsp;  SPENCER, looking confident, is sitting next to a girl and they are engaged in conversation.&nbsp; SPENCER is emphatically waving his hands.&nbsp; A few surrounding students are obviously occupied and impressed by the conversation.  &nbsp;  SPENCER  …and the guy was just laying there on the bench, with his legs up in the air and the bar pressed against his chest.&nbsp; So me and one of the other trainers run over…  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON ERIC HOWARTH AND SARAH KELLEY  &nbsp;  ERIC and SARAH, both well-dressed, are sitting next to each other.&nbsp; They each have everything in order – there is an open notebook and pen on each of their desks, as they sit with their arms crossed.&nbsp; They are arguing, but clearly trying to restrain themselves with whispers.&nbsp; They seem to be familiar with this, and it is implied that this happens often.  &nbsp;  ERIC  I just don’t see whey every time your mother is in town for a weekend we have to drop every single thing we had planned –  &nbsp;  SARAH  Eric, it’s just one weekend.&nbsp; And she hasn’t been here in two months.  &nbsp;  ERIC  Well, I hope she doesn’t bring the dog again.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON DAWN FARMER  &nbsp;  DAWN is sitting only one seat away from SPENCER, and seems to be entertained by his story even though she does not turn and look at him.&nbsp; PHIL WISZCLOWICZ, meanwhile, steps into DAWN’s row and begins to awkwardly slide in.&nbsp; He passes to the side of DAWN that SPENCER is not on, and seems to consider taking a seat directly next to DAWN.&nbsp; He nervously leaves a seat between them.  &nbsp;  PHIL sits and begins to take out a notebook, textbook, and two pens.&nbsp; Appears to be thinking about how to say hello.  &nbsp;  DAWN  Hey, Phil.  &nbsp;  PHIL  Hey…&nbsp; Did you do the reading for today?  &nbsp;  DAWN  Yeah, it was pretty interesting.&nbsp; I did it right before class, over in the café by the arts building.  &nbsp;  PHIL  Oh, really? You know, I work in the library right next to there.&nbsp; Maybe on Thursday, I mean, if you’re going to be over there again, I could maybe –  &nbsp;  SPENCER is leaning towards DAWN and passing a flyer to her.&nbsp; He takes her attention.  &nbsp;  SPENCER  My band is playing Friday over at the Rebel’s Roost.&nbsp; The owner works out at Beefcake and so he’s a friend of mine.&nbsp; Drinks will be on the house.&nbsp; You should come by.  &nbsp;  WIDER ANGLE ON CLASS  &nbsp;  Now there are fifteen or so total students at desks.&nbsp; At least one student has his head down.&nbsp; The door opens, and everyone turns to look.&nbsp; It is the teacher, PROFESSOR WHITE.  &nbsp;  ANOTHER ANGLE, FAVORING PROFESSOR WHITE.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE enters the room from the door at the back of the class.&nbsp; He walks down the row at the side of the room and sets a bag down on a table in front.&nbsp; As he walks in…  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Well, I hope everyone had a nice weekend and found time to get through that chapter on finance.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE takes a book and some notes out of his bag.&nbsp; Looking at his notes, he glances up at everyone.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  It looks like the first class must not have scared anyone away.&nbsp; Just about everyone seems to be have come back.  &nbsp;  Just then the door at the back of class opens again.&nbsp; All heads turn.&nbsp; THE NEW GUY steps into the classroom and everything is silent.&nbsp; THE NEW GUY is dressed kind of 80’s cool – almost like something out of 21 Jumpstreet, with big hair and a flannel shirt.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON THE NEW GUY  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  You must be –  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  Yeah. The new guy.  &nbsp;  There are whispers from all over the classroom.  &nbsp;  GIRL #1 (whispering)  He’s so cute.  &nbsp;  GIRL #2 (whispering)  Where’d he come from?  &nbsp;  GIRL #3 (whispering)  I don’t know, but he’s gorgeous.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  You can just have a seat where you’d like.  &nbsp;  Girls all over the classroom scramble to take backpacks and books out of the chairs next to them.&nbsp; They sit up straight and turn towards THE NEW GUY and smile.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  Thanks, dude.  &nbsp;  BOY #1 (whispering)  He just called the professor “dude.”  &nbsp;  BOY #2 (whispering)  That’s so cool.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY finds a seat by himself towards the back of the class.&nbsp; SARAH, in the meantime, has pulled out a small mirror and his checking herself out in it.&nbsp; ERIC notices and makes a disgusted face.  &nbsp;  OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT OF THE CLASSROOM (from WHITE’s p.o.v.)  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Ok, where were we? Yes, finance.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON PROFESSOR WHITE  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE turns towards the chalkboard behind him.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  When the tax base is multiplied by the tax rate we have what will be called the total yield…  &nbsp;  FADE OUT  &nbsp;  FADE IN:  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE is again at the board, and is facing the class.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  And those, then, are the formulas through which state sales tax is typically derived.&nbsp; On that note, let’s take a ten minute break.&nbsp; And don’t forget about the quiz you’ll have at the end of class – all on information from today’s lesson.  &nbsp;  WIDER ANGLE ON CLASS  &nbsp;  Most students make some noise closing their books, standing up, and moving towards the door.&nbsp; There is chatter as everyone leaves.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  …DAWN, PHIL, SPENCER, ERIC, and SARAH standing together as THE NEW GUY walks by them.  &nbsp;  PHIL  So who is that guy, anyways?  &nbsp;  DAWN  I don’t know, but there’s something really different about him…  &nbsp;  GIRL #1 walks up.  &nbsp;  GIRL #1  I heard he’s been bouncing around different graduate school programs for years – a real drifter, you know?&nbsp; He started off of in education, then he was in art history.&nbsp; After that was in law school for a while, and now he’s in public policy with us.  &nbsp;  SPENCER and ERIC both make confused faces.&nbsp; BOY #1 walks up to the group.  &nbsp;  BOY #1  I heard his parents died in a car accident when he was 6, and that he went from foster home to foster home until graduating high school.  &nbsp;  DAWN and SARAH are both visibly impressed.  &nbsp;  PHIL  Wait, how do you know all this?  &nbsp;  GIRL #2, now with the group.  Remember that law professor that died a couple of years back?&nbsp; I heard it had something to do with THE NEW GUY!  &nbsp;  GIRL #1  Shhhh! Here he comes.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY walks back down the hall and chooses a spot about five feet away to lean against.&nbsp; He is leaning with his back to the wall, one knee bent, with that foot flat against the wall.&nbsp; He leans his head back and runs his fingers through his hair.&nbsp; GIRL #1 gets the courage to go talk to him.  &nbsp;  GIRL #1  So, are you new to the school?  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  Look… thanks for trying to be nice, but can’t you see I’m a drifter? You shouldn’t fall for me… I’m a loner.&nbsp; Do you know what that means?  &nbsp;  By now everyone in the hallway is watching.  &nbsp;  GIRL #1  But maybe we could make it work…  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  That’s just it… it can’t work.  &nbsp;  ERIC  Hey, everybody, I think our break is up.&nbsp; We should get back to the room.  &nbsp;  Everyone quietly moves back towards the classroom.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  …the classroom, with PROFESSOR WHITE at the front, discussing taxes.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  For the past forty years, there have been significant changes in the tax revenues raised by different governmental levels.&nbsp; Total tax revenues for all levels of government have more than doubled in each of the decades between 1950 and 2000…  &nbsp;  Suddenly, a cell phone rings.&nbsp; It’s THE NEW GUY’s phone, and instead of a really cool ring tone it is a very nerdy one.&nbsp; Everyone quiets and looks at him.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY (in a cool, confident voice)  Oh… sorry.  &nbsp;  GIRL #1  Did you hear that? The new guy didn’t turn his cell phone off!  &nbsp;  GIRL #2  Yeah.&nbsp; Isn’t he amazing?  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE continues talking  Tax revenues have increased by over half a trillion dollars in the past forty years.&nbsp; This reflects overall governmental growth during that period.&nbsp; In addition, nominal state government revenues have increased at a faster rate than revenues for either the federal or local governments, rising by over 3600 percent in the last forty years…  &nbsp;  As PROFESSOR WHITE talks…  &nbsp;  GIRL #2, sitting right in front of SPENCER, gets up to go to the restroom.  &nbsp;  DAWN is doodling in her notebook.  &nbsp;  INSERT: DAWN’S hand is writing in a notebook.&nbsp; She is drawing a heart, with the words “ME + NEW GUY” written in it.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON SARAH.  &nbsp;  SARAH is sitting with her hand on her chin, staring at THE NEW GUY.&nbsp; ERIC notices and bumps her with his elbow.&nbsp; ERIC is noticeably disappointed.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON DAWN.  &nbsp;  INSERT: DAWN is writing again.&nbsp; This time she is signing her name over and over: “Mrs. Dawn New Guy, Mrs. Dawn New Guy, Mrs. Dawn New Guy”  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Yes, a question?  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  Tax structures have clearly been changing quite a bit over the years. Wouldn’t it make sense for governments to create stability in the tax structure so that the business community and households could make decisions in a more stable fiscal environment?  &nbsp;  The class turns and watches THE NEW GUY as he says this.&nbsp; There is quiet for a few seconds.  &nbsp;  PHIL  Yeah, the new guy is right.&nbsp; Not only could better decisions be made, but government could function more efficiently because its revenue wouldn’t be as variable.  &nbsp;  Everyone slowly turns to look back at PROFESSOR WHITE, who pauses before speaking.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  You’re exactly right.&nbsp; And your intuitive question serves as a perfect segue into our next topic: the political and economic motivations for changing tax structures in the first place.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON PHIL, WITH THE NEW GUY OUT OF FOCUS IN THE BACKGROUND  &nbsp;  PHIL turns to look back at the new guy.&nbsp; He stares for a second, and then nods.  &nbsp;  FOCUS ON THE GUY  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY waits a second, and then nods back.&nbsp; He holds the stare, and then looks back towards PROFESSOR WHITE.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON GIRL #2, who is returning from the restroom.  &nbsp;  GIRL #2 takes her seat in front of SPENCER.&nbsp; As she leans forward to take notes, the top band of her underwear is showing.&nbsp; “THE NEW GUY” is freshly written in sharpie.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON SPENCER.  &nbsp;  SPENCER mouths “what the fuck.”&nbsp; He turns towards ERIC, who has also noticed.  &nbsp;  SPENCER  Did she just do that in the bathroom?&nbsp; This is starting to get ridiculous.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  …a shot of the classroom from the front.&nbsp; Music comes on, signaling the beginning of a montage.&nbsp; The following clips short clips are included:  &nbsp;  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE NEW GUY has his hand up.&nbsp; PROFESSOR WHITE can be heard prompting him, “Yes?”&nbsp;  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE NEW GUY SAYS “but you’ve got to remember that for any individual family unit the ultimate impact of taxes is the sum of not only state and federal but also local.”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANGLE ON PHIL, who is smiling and nodding approvingly.  &nbsp;  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOY #2 says, “but different levels of government collect different taxes with different efficiencies.”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHIL follows with, “Which is why the US has a system of intergovernmental transfers.”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE NEW GUY finishes, “…Used by states and the fed to provide incentives for local taxing jurisdictions.”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROFESSOR WHITE smiles and nods his head, saying “Once again, you’re all exactly right.”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three students beam at one another.  &nbsp;  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROFESSOR WHITE asks, “So then what, exactly, would an economist consider the ‘best’ kind of tax?”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIRL #1 says, “Well, it would have to have a broad base…”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SARAH continues, “And a low tax rate…”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE NEW GUY, “And consume a larger portion of wealthy individuals’ incomes than of poor individuals’ incomes, making it…”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone at once, “A progressive tax.”  ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in slow-motion à PROFESSOR WHITE pumps his fist a couple of times and points at THE NEW GUY.&nbsp; THE NEW GUY, in turn, points at PHIL, who is pointing back.&nbsp; The montage ends as the song is cut.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Alright, let’s take the last break.&nbsp; You’ve got ten minutes.&nbsp; We’ll take the quiz when you get back.  &nbsp;  WIDER ANGLE, again, as the students get up to take their break.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  the hallway.  &nbsp;  The students are again loosely huddled around one another, but this time THE NEW GUY is part of the group.&nbsp; SPENCER walks up, and taps THE NEW GUY on the shoulder.  &nbsp;  SPENCER  Can I talk to you for a second?  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  Sure.&nbsp; What’s up?  &nbsp;  SPENCER  Listen, maybe you don’t understand how it works around here, but no one just waltzes into one of these classrooms and takes over.&nbsp; I don’t know what you’re trying to prove, buddy, but it ain’t workin’.&nbsp; Around here we work hard and we play hard, and one thing we don’t do is bow down to any old new guy who walks through those doors.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  (Pauses for a few seconds, confused.) What are you talking about?  &nbsp;  SPENCER  I don’t know, I guess I got kind of off track.&nbsp; But just watch it, okay?  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY says nothing, but stands there as SPENCER walks back to the group.&nbsp; SPENCER pulls some folded up sheets of paper from his back pocket, and begins distributing them to everyone.&nbsp; PHIL does not take one.&nbsp; Neither does DAWN.  &nbsp;  SPENCER  So remember that buddy of mine I told you about who took this class last semester?  &nbsp;  ERIC  The one from Beefcake?  &nbsp;  SPENCER  Yeah.&nbsp; Well, he’s got copies of all the quizzes.&nbsp; Here’s the one we’re taking tonight.&nbsp; Take a look.&nbsp; It’s everything we’ve been talking about today.  &nbsp;  BOY #1  Wow, thanks Spence.  &nbsp;  GIRL #2  Yeah, this is great. Thanks.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON SPENCER&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As everyone thanks him and gets a few pats on the back, he smiles and turns to THE NEW GUY.&nbsp; THE NEW GUY just shakes his head and slowly walks back into the classroom.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  …the classroom, where PROFESSOR WHITE is about to hand out the quiz.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE (handing out the papers)  You have fifteen minutes to finish.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE begins walking around the room and giving every student a quiz.&nbsp; As ERIC gets his, he smiles and looks at SPENCER.&nbsp; The two nod to one another, and everyone begins writing.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  …a few minutes later.&nbsp; Everyone continues to write, and PROFESSOR WHITE slowly walks around the room.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  …everyone sitting at their desk quietly, with nothing in front of them.&nbsp; GIRL #1 finishes her quiz and walks it up to PROFESSOR WHITE.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON PROFESSOR WHITE  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Well, that’s the last quiz.&nbsp; Don’t forget to read chapters 3 and 4 before Thursday’s class.&nbsp; I’ll see you then.  &nbsp;  WIDER ANGLE of the entire class.&nbsp; Everyone puts their things into various backpacks and bags and makes their way towards the door.  &nbsp;  CUT TO:  &nbsp;  …the hallway.  &nbsp;  In a couple groups, everyone is making their way down the hall when PROFESSOR WHITE shouts down the hallway.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Everyone stop.  &nbsp;  PHIL  What is it?  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Whose is this?  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE holds up a copy of the quizzes that SPENCER was passing out during the break.&nbsp; Everyone is now crowded around PROFESSOR WHITE.&nbsp; No one is saying anything.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  This is a copy of the quiz.&nbsp; Someone has cheated on this quiz, and I want to know who it is.&nbsp; If no one takes responsibility for this, then everyone will have a 0%.  &nbsp;  Again, there is silence.&nbsp; No one is admitting to it… and then THE NEW GUY pushes his way to the front of the group.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  It’s mine.&nbsp; I did it.  &nbsp;  Everyone is shocked, but no one says anything.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON SPENCER  &nbsp;  SPENCER just stands there, clearly shocked.&nbsp; He says nothing.&nbsp; PHIL, in the meantime, looks like he wants to say something but is quiet.&nbsp; He just looks between THE NEW GUY and SPENCER.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE  Well, I’m extremely disappointed.&nbsp; You do understand you’ll be expelled from the program?&nbsp; School policy.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  Yeah.  &nbsp;  PROFESSOR WHITE shakes his head and walks back into the classroom.&nbsp; In the meantime, THE NEW GUY says nothing.&nbsp; As he begins to walk, the group parts at creates a path for him.&nbsp; Everyone quietly watches as he walks away.&nbsp; Just before he gets to the door, SPENCER speaks.  &nbsp;  SPENCER  Hey, new guy – Why’d you say you did it?  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY stops and turns sideways, with his head facing the group.&nbsp; SPENCER is now standing at the head of the group, so that he is closest to the new guy.&nbsp; PHIL is just behind SPENCER, with a desperate look on his face.&nbsp; THE NEW GUY waits a few seconds.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY  For the first time, I felt like I was part of a family.&nbsp; You accepted me into you hearts, and it meant something…&nbsp; That’s why I did it.  &nbsp;  Silence.&nbsp; After a few seconds, THE NEW GUY’s phone begins to ring.&nbsp; He answers it.  &nbsp;  THE NEW GUY (into his phone)  Hey, what’s up dude.  &nbsp;  Slowly, he turns and walks.&nbsp; He pushes his way through a door and is gone.  &nbsp;  ANGLE ON the group.  &nbsp;  SPENCER is nodding, finally with approval.&nbsp; ERIC and SARAH stand next to each other, holding hands.&nbsp; PHIL stares off into the distance.  &nbsp;  CLOSE UP on DAWN’s face.  &nbsp;  A tear rolls down DAWN’s face.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  FADE OUT.

      So character A has grown himself a beard.&nbsp; When he walks into class, he sees another guy with a beard (character B), and so he sits down next to him. &nbsp; A: "Hey.&nbsp; Cool beard." B: "Oh... thanks." &nbsp; Character A is expecting some sort of "yeah, you've got a nice beard too" comment back, but doesn't get one.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Later, during a break, A sees B talking with some other guy with a beard.&nbsp; They seem to be talking about beards, and their strategies for shaving them.&nbsp; This other guy has a cool-guy, sharp-edges beard like someone from a boyband would have. &nbsp; After break, A mentions something about that other guy's beard to B.&nbsp; B pretends not to know what A is talking about. &nbsp; ----------------- &nbsp; Next class: A walks in with a beard just like the one the 'other guy' had.&nbsp; He takes a seat.&nbsp; When B walks into class, A says "what's up" and B just walks by him and sits somewhere else. &nbsp; A walks away dejected. &nbsp; ---------------- &nbsp; Next class: A walks in with a moustache and sits next to another dude with a moustache. &nbsp; A:&nbsp;"Nice moustache." &nbsp; The&nbsp;episode ends. &nbsp; ----------------- &nbsp; This could&nbsp;either be its own episode or somehow be spliced into an introduction episode...&nbsp;

      The opening of every "Grad School" episode shows an image of the outside of a college building (possibly one of Depaul's buildings on Kenmore or Sheffield) with students walking in and out.&nbsp; Some song is playing in the background (...maybe "crab dance" by Cat Stevens). &nbsp; One of the "Grad School" episodes, maybe another one besides the New Guy or the Group Project, should contain the bit from the original full-length movie idea - "Can you watch this form me?"&nbsp; There are some good ideas that could spring from that. &nbsp; Love interest - Phil has a recurring crush on Dawn, who he thinks likes Spence.&nbsp; Dawn, meanwhile, does like Spence but not romantically and has no intentions of dating him.&nbsp; STEREOTYPICAL SITUATION: Phil tries to get the courage to ask Dawn out on a date, but when he's ready Spence interrupts and gives her an invitation to a party. &nbsp; Larissa had an idea today... inspired by Point Break and countless other sweet movies, she likes the idea of including a chase scene in one of the episodes of "grad school" (or "public policy" or whatever else we end up calling it) that involves running through numerous private residences and backyards and apartments.&nbsp; I like the idea, but I'm wondering about the feasibility with no budget.&nbsp; Obviously classroom scenes are possible because we could use classrooms at LPHS, IIT (thanks to Stasi), or Depaul... &nbsp; THE GROUP PROJECT IDEA: Along with the other montages, perhaps before the presentation the students can look at each other and all at one say "what we need now are... NEW OUTFITS!"&nbsp;followed by a changing-room montage.

      I'd like to see one girl leave to go the bathroom.  When she returns, she has a seat and lean forwards, so that "New Guy" can be read on the top of her underwear.  "Did she just do that in the bathroom?" One dude asks...  "This is getting to be fucking ridiculous," Spence answers.

      After the new guy comes in and sits down (and everyone notices him), the professor continues with his lecture.  The the new guy's cell phone goes off during class, and instead of some really cool ring tone, it's a really nerdy one.  Everyone quiets and looks at him.  "Oh... sorry," he says in a really cool voice, and casually turns off the phone.  In the meantime, there are girls (maybe Sarah Kelley) who are writing things in their notebooks like "Sarah (hearts) New Guy" and "Me + New Guy."  Maybe Sarah is even writing "Mrs. Sarah New Guy."  ----------------------------------------------  Unrelated: Later in class the professor uses a weird expression like "You need to make sure you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater" when talking about a principle.  There are a few sarcastic glances between students who think the professor is a nerd or whatever, and then the camera focuses on one student taking notes, who is trying to follow the lecture and is intently writing nothing that really has to do with the lecture, but gets "don't throw baby out with bathwater" down.

      The movie will start off with the class talking amongst themselves as the class comes into the room.  One of the discernible dialogues will include a classmate feeling Spencer's muscle, as he talks about a story from the gym earlier that day...  Later, there will be an interaction between the new guy and Spencer, one of the regulars on the show.  The sort of dialogue where the regular says "Listen, maybe you don't understand how it works around here..." in an angry tone.  Will also at some point say "'round here we work hard, and we play hard..."

      So maybe instead of a street festival there can be a whole new character who may add the missing dimension to the full-length movie.  A priest, who works at a parish down the street from A.  He begins to run into A every once in a while, being in the same neighborhood, and A becomes a sort of confidant.  Eventually it comes out that the priest, who is around 30, no longer believes in God.  Furthermore, there is an armed robber plaguing the northside of the city.  There are ads up with rewards for information leading to his arrest.  This robber has been seeing the priest weekly for confession.  As the priest does not even believe in what he is doing, he finds solace in revealing all of this to A.  This then presents A with the option of calling the cops and telling them about the criminal.  He does so, but the robber has a feeling about it (because he sees the priest talking to A one day), and so the robber does not show up to confession when the cops are there.  This makes one more character who is after A (but may eventually be caught and present the money necessary for A to give to C to pay back the debt-collecters...)

      It starts with class about to begin as usual, maybe the 2nd or 3rd class in a 10 week course.  Suddenly, before class starts, the new guy walks in and everyone notices.  He's dressed kind of late 80's cool - almost like something out of 21 jumpstreet, with cool hair and a flannel shirt, etc.   Lots of whispers among the class (i.e. "Who's the new guy?" "Boy, he's cute!").   Later, rumors begin spreading.  The new guy has been bouncing around for years in different graduate school programs.  He started off in public policy, then he was in art history, then law school, and now education.  His parents supposedly died in a car accident.  There's a rumor that he killed one of his old professors.   A few classes in, someone gets the guts to talk to him during a break.  Next class, one of the girls asks him out. He responds by saying "you shouldn't fall for me... I'm a drifter... do you know what that means?"   Later, the class begins to accept him.  He makes a point in class to the professor and his classmates start to back him up.  He notices the difference and is clearly touched.   Finally, there is a test.  Some of the students in the class cheat by xeroxing a copy of the test and circulating it.  The new guy is not one of them, because he says he doesn't want to be part of that.  After the test, the professor finds a copy that someone used to cheat.  Next class, he demands that the guilty person admit to it, or else "everyone will get a 0%."  Silence.  No one is admitting to it.  And then... the new guy stands up and says he did it.  Everyone is shocked.  The professor tells him he will be expelled from the program, and he says fine. After class, he's walking off down the hall when the class stops him.   "Hey, New Guy...  Why'd do you say you did it?"   New Guy: "For the first time, I felt like I was part of a family.  You accepted me into your hearts, and it meant something to me...  That's why I did it."   New guy dramatically walks off.

      So in class tonight I started thinking about funny ideas for short movies involving grad school.  It would be sweet to have a series of like 4 or 5 short movies involving the same class of students...  -----------------------  The movie would begin with a professor assigning a project on something mundane - something like the pros and cons of school vouchers.     Everyone in the group gets excited - they all want to meet at Starbucks the next night and start working on it.   Once they're at starbucks they realize that they disagree on a lot of things and they're having a hard time getting organized.  When things get really bad, one of them decides they need to take the next step... and hire an expert.   Late at night, he meets the expert on a park bench in the middle of nowhere.  They exchange a few words, and he passes the expert's test.  He agrees to help the group.   At this point, I'm thinking there would be an awesome montage of the group doing research and creating a powerpoint mixed with physical military-type drills and trust falls and rope climb team-building type exercises.  An awesome 80s song would be playing in the background of the whole thing.  Maybe it would end with them partying at a bar or something the night before the big presentation.   Next, they're in the classroom on presentation day.  The scene opens at the end of another group's presentation.  The presenters did a really nice job, and so our group is intimidated.  The professor says that they'll take a short break and then the group will present when they get back.   They go outside to take a break, and they're real nervous.  Then, they think back to some of the things they've learned.  As they go back inside, there's a kick-ass slow-motion scene where they all look half-cool and half-nerdy as they walk in and give the presentation.   Then there are some clips of the presentation, and they do a nice job.  Another montage shows clips of group members dramatically pointing to charts on a powerpoint or slamming their fists down on the podium as they say something.  In the meantime, shots of the audience show classmates nodding and smiling enthusiastically as they take notes on the project.  The movie closes with a fade-out and then a fade-in to the expert, who is away on an island somewhere and gets a note from the group filling him in on the good grade they got.  Just as he receives it, he gets a cell phone call of another group who needs his help, and the movie fades out again.

      Over the 4th of July weekend I was brainstorming ideas with Claire and we came up with what I think might be a good premise.  Here goes...  CHARACTER A: "Main character;" teacher on summer break, 25-ish, guy, his big conflict is that he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life - he likes teaching but isn't sure if it's what he wants to do; in a loungy/rock cover band with B  CHARACTER B: Friend of A, unemployed, looking to make some money however he can, old friend of C; in band with A  CHARACTER C: From a wealthy family (his dad is an alderman in Chicago), has no job besides a silly job coaching a high school girls club lacrosse team, old friend of B, is has a gambling problem, needs money to pay back a debt, engaged to G  CHARACTER G: the girl, engaged to C  SEMI-PLOT OUTLINE:  -Starts out on the final days of school... One of A's friends at school, another, older teacher has connections to a big street festival that is going on in Chicago at the end of the summer and he gets A's band to be featured at it... says he's looking forward to it...  -Characters A & B go to a party because C has recently called B saying he has a job for him... at the party, C tells B he wants him to steal his fiance's engagement ring (G's), and he tells him how to do it (how to break into G's apartment and get it... Meanwhile, A & G, who don't know each other or who the other is, are hitting it off in an other room at the party.  A gives G his phone number.  A & B leave.  -Next night, A & B break into G's apartment and steal the ring so that C can collect on the insurance money (he has a gambling debt).  They then drop the ring off to C as directed... C pays them $500... Meanwhile, A realized that it's the apartment of the girl from the party yesterday!  -G wakes up and notices the ring is gone.  She is trying to figure out where it could be... calls A to ask if he noticed it on her finger the other day at the party (because he gave her his phone number)... A, who likes her, suggests they don't talk about it now but meet later for a drink or lunch to talk about it...  -C ends up seeing them out at lunch together.  He doesn't know that A was B's partner, and A can't say anything in front of G.  So C gets all upset, and threatens to screw over A.  He says his dad is an alderman, and A just laughs, figuring "what can an alderman do?"  -Next day, A wakes up and his car is being towed.  He runs out there with B, and they watch as it's getting taken away.  Meanwhile, some of A's students from the high school (on summer break now) drive by in a convertible and say something insulting.  A doesn't really pay attention to them, but B gets all upset and writes down the license plate number, saying he'll get them back.  -Character B, unbeknownst to A, later goes and intimdates the high school kid, and tells him to mow A's lawn.  He keeps intimidating the kid and say "that's what you get for laughing at the misfortune of others" (ridiculous thing for him to yell at him for)  -Next day A wakes up and hears someone mowing his lawn.  It's the kid from the convertible.  A tells him to go home.  -Next day A's principal calls and tells him to come in.  The parents of the kid have complained... Principal tells A that he's on thin ice as far as being allowed to return next year. This pisses off A and makes him even more confused as far as whether he wants to return...  -Thus, we introduce a private investigator from the Chicago Public Schools, whose job it is to find teachers who are not actually living within the city limits of Chicago and report them.  The P.I. has been told by the principal to watch A, because he's looking for an excuse to fire him.  -A's car is gone, and so he needs to take cabs to get around... two or three terrible cab situations could occur (a la Joe Shafer's experiences): (1) the cabby doesn't have change to give to A and so he keeps him hostage in a cab while he drives around and tries to get change, and (2) A is attacked from behind as he walks from the car by a cabby (who made a bunch of wrong turns) and is unhappy with his tip.  -These cab situations scare A out of taking more cabs... eventually he just asks the P.I., who follows him everywhere, if he can just get a ride from him (b/c he's still following him anyways)  -A, B, and a few of their friends are every once in a while playing in their band at a bar.  They have a rival rock band who takes themselves very seriously and gets most of the major shows/bars.  This rival band has a leader who is extremely upset that A's band has been given the street festival show, which the rival band was counting on getting.  -In the meantime, on his way home from a bar late at night, A is suddenly "kidnapped" by a bunch of tough guys in a car.  They tell him that they know he's "friends with C because they've seen him talking to him" (the day C found A at lunch with G), and that C owes them money.  Because they're friends, if C doesn't pay then they will hold A responsible as well.  A tries to tell them that he's NOT friends with C, but they don't listen.  They just drop him off on the side of the road and pull away.  -A is totally confused and doesn't know what's going on.  For information, he goes to the P.I. and tells him he'll give the name of a teacher at his school that doesn't live in Chicago if the P.I. will do some investigating for him.  The guy agrees, and when A gives him a name, the P.I. finds out about the tough guys in the car... He finds out that C has a gambling problem, and that he once borrowed money from a guy at a casino. He lost the money and was unable to pay the guy back.  This is one of the reasons that C is trying to scramble for money and had B steal the engagement ring back so he could get the insurance money.  Nevertheless, C still owes big money.  -C's dad, the alderman, wants his son to prove himself, and so he puts his son in charge of the big street festival coming up.  -----------------------------------------  Something big will go down at the street festival.  I'm not sure what, yet, but it will be good.  C needs to make a whole bunch of money, so i think he should be planning something that will make him money but still make him look respectable in front of his dad.  Maybe he will have the festival be robbed or something.  I don't know yet.  But the festival will be a big thing that brings a lot of the pieces of the movie together - G will be there (who C has been trying to "bump into" as much as possible, at the gym, the supermarket, etc), the rival band will be there (who have been threating A's band and A), the casino guys will be there, maybe any other characters), maybe even the high school girls that play on C's lacrosse team (which he may use in his scheme)  -----------------------------------------  The movie will end with things being somewhat resolved between the characters.  Nevertheless, A has become disillusioned with Chicago and has made up his mind to move away (maybe to the pacific northwest).  Thus, his "need" throughout the movie is resolved.  He has decided that he will continue to teach, because he likes it, but that he no longer wants to live in Chicago.    The clincher will be that as he is driving away, he goes to stops to say goodbye to G.  He doesn't realize it, but she slips something in a card to him.  He opens it up, as she requests, when he is outside of Chicago.  It contains the engagement ring (which she has somehow found out about, and taken from C and now given to A).  It is totally off anyone's record, because it has already been reported stolen, and so he can do whatever he wants with it.  Assuming it is worth a lot of money, it will be good starter money for him wherever he goes...  ----------------------------------------  Well, that is the idea we came up with.  I'm pretty sure I left some small parts and characters out, but for the most part I got it all in.  What do you think?  It's a little bit of a different style than the last idea - I think it would be a comedy, but more because the characters and situations are ridiculous, not as slapsticky as I think the Jackass-type movie may be...  Let me know if you like it!

      Justin, sorry I've been lazy this past week  or 2.  I will chalk it up to watching lots of movies and being a fat jerk-off jerk.  Hopefully this won't happen again.  Peace in the Mid-East motherfuckers!

      Greetings fellers.  I still check in on this shit regularly, but due to my new job and lack of home internet, I feel I am letting you down on my duties as co-screenwriter.  The amount of ideas I have aren't nearly as much as you guys, plus they aren't even that great.  I chalk it up to my overall state of exhaustion.   Don't let me hold you back though.  Keep on keeping on.

      Hey all, I am writing this from the big city... Champaign!  Hmm, ok it's not that big of a city, but I am partially moved down here already.  I think Josh is leaving on Wednesday and Katie later this week, so it's a perfect time to have a party!  Katie is organizing a party at her and my (old) place... I'm not toally moved yet, so I'll be back up there as well (I might be late, but I'll be there!)  It's Tuesday evening, come whenever you can make it (early evening I'm guessing) until however late you can make it.  1152 W Newport Ave... and hopefully if the weather holds for us we'll have it in our front yard.  See you there!

      Howdy y'all, (as Josh would say...)   I've got two things for you today.    1) My friends are having a going away party for me this coming Friday, and you are all cordially  invited.  I will probably send out an invitation E-mail separate from this post, which people may or may not see, but I just wanted to let you know so you could cancel all your other plans.  I'd love to see you there!  &  2) It's hopefully my last traditional corporate Monday ever... Hooray for me.  Boo to fancy corporations and their Herman-Miller chairs.  Boo!

Please post early and often!  The Blogger software is easy and intuitive to use, so have a blast!  Please feel free to share this address with whomever you think would be interested... Josh and I will be able to add users as well, in case anyone inadvertantly got left out.    And since this is the Internet, the rules are: be nice.     .joel

      It was bound to happen sooner or later and, whereas I'd much rather tell y'all in person, this is probably the easiest way to tell everybody. I'M GONNA BE A DADDY! My wife is about to enter her second trimester and the baby is due at the end of January. Next time you're raising a glass, think of a little me and drink heavily. By the way, we will, of course, be naming the child Marmot.

      I enjoy these blogs for personal revelation.  For instance, I enjoy plants.  Plants of all kinds.  Flowers especially.  I recently purchased a few small house plants, an antique potting bed, and some moss.  I took these and put together a pleasant little ensemble.  I know this sounds really soft, but actually I found it relaxing and enjoyable.  If I won the lotto, I would buy four things after taking care of friends and family.  A restaurant, a golf course, a flower shop, and a gym like Average Joes.   Ok, who am I kidding?  The gym would be way more extreme than Globo-Gym, except without the supplements and plastic surgery.  And also with way more shiny vests (Jack?....Joel?).

      So I stop a car the other night and it is this gangbanger dude driving.  So, I put all my lights on the car so he can't see me walk up and I walk up on the passenger side so he can't see me.  He is looking out the driver's window and I am standing at the passenger window.  I am about to ask him for his license when I see the back end of a  handgun sticking out from between the cushions of the driver and front passenger seat.  So I take my gun out and tell the guy to put his hands on the steering wheel and not move. He looks at the gun and goes to reach for it... I then told him not to move and he said... I just want to show you its a B B Gun.  I put my finger on the trigger when he moved and shit myself After the TURD fell down my pant leg. I politely asked him again not to move and to get out and lay face down on the ground.  So I go check the gun then, and it is an all metal BB gun which is painted all black and has all the functioning parts of a gun, only bb pellets instead.  The guy then told me that he figured something like this would happen if he kept the gun right there, but that he only keeps it there for protection from the rival gangs.  I don't know why people think like that.

      Bagel - it is bullshit that you finally get me to come down to Champaign to hook up with you on a daily basis a la Courtney Potempa in high school and then you ditch me.  WHATEVER.  Todd - Way to still be friends with Bert.  NOT COOL AT ALL.  Whitey - That's cool that you almost shot someone.  Remember when you almost stabbed Chairman in your full police regalia?  You don't!?  Well it's a good thing that I have pictures!   Landon - Sweet hair.  Don't cut it before I see you in Chi-city or else!  Also, I have a present for you.  Remind me about it, or I will totally forget.  I am serious this time, you!  Also, I am still not telling you how I know about SPLEEM or PEEM.  Who else is on this blog?  Ah, fuck it, I will just update you dudes on what is going on with me:  Pretty much a lot of relaxing and getting sweet tattoos.  I finished my tattoo last week.  It still has a couple of scabs on it, but when those shits fall off I will post a picture for all to see.  I also am writing up a brief schematic for the workers revolution, while listening to the Internationale.  It's raining like a (little) bitch here today, or I would be on a bike ride.    If you want to see a sweet picture of Jack and I in vests from '99 Hilton Head, check out  urlLink Hansel.   Stas- Congrats on being mostly done with your dissertation.  Bagel - I think Philly is a little too tough for you.  Will you be living in the suburbs and commuting?    Later doots, and by doots I mean dudes,  Joel

      Bagel dute, I'm not sure if I'd ever check the Friendster thing to see if I have added new friends to any list of friends. I'm quite happy with the friends that I have now and am sure that I'll be busy enough with skool that finding dates via the friend-friendly Friendster friend-finding fructose-limited network isn't my style. Sorry, dute but maybe later.  Stasi, this is in no way a cut at your expertise on the web-wild ways of wowing the chicas (or cuban guys). For now, I'm a romantic and have my heart set on one girl and...well, we'll see.  p.s. Bagel, I know there are hot young ladies with intellect in the city of brotherly love. Philly.com said that the dance club Shampoo is the hip place to boogy and libations around town lean toward "colorful concoctions with silly names and fruity tastes." In other words, you'll love the neo-soft slant of Philly.

      Chairman, friendster is an internet-'friend' community.&nbsp; Basically you post pictures of yourself and write a 'cute' bio.&nbsp; As I have found out, it is also a great place to meet girls to go on sweet dates.&nbsp;   Bagel, the head of the psychiatry department at the University of Chicago's name is Dawn Graziano.&nbsp; I should ask her how JP is doing (I mean, I have never spoken to him in my life, yet am concerned about his well-being).&nbsp;&nbsp;   F' the Cubs, F' the White&nbsp;Sox.&nbsp; Football starts soon, and that means that it is time for my beloved Green Bay Packers to&nbsp;suck ass&nbsp;again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So I've been in Berkeley for the past two days and it has been awesome.&nbsp; I wish you guys could see Landon's hair.&nbsp; It is honestly probably the sweetest hair that anyone has ever had.   Part of the issue with my chafing was that until the marathon I didn't have any good shorts to run in.&nbsp; I would wear basketball shorts, and either boxers or no underwear at all.&nbsp; Eventually I got boxer briefs, and that made it better, and then for the actual run I had real running shorts and had no problems.   Tonight I'm having dinner with Pyka, who now works at a bakery that was just voted the #1 bakery in San Francisco by the newspaper (the same article, incidentally,&nbsp;voted Jamba Juice the best place to get a non-alcoholic drink)!   Chairman, I don't get back until the 12th.&nbsp; Bad timing... And once again, as for Stick, he adamantly insists that "Bagel never invited me to join the blogger."

Can someone tell Stick that I no longer need to speak with him? It seems as though I can just as easily get my Stick updates via Shafer/Bagel/Silver Steve/John Kerry/Al Sharpton, etc. Rev. Sharpton can tell me more about Abbott's diabolical plans or living with Stick's girlfriend in Boston. Stas, despite HIPAA violations, I'd enjoy hearing about your wacked out patients. I was with another asperger's pt several weeks ago and this kid was amazing.

      My Dad knows that I'm very excited about going to Penn.&nbsp; So naturally, he likes to give me shit about it.&nbsp; So every time we talk about logistics, like loans or housing, he says, "David, have you found your housing for Penn State yet?"&nbsp; And I get really mad, and tell him that I'm not going to Penn State.&nbsp; And he says something like&nbsp; "Whatever."  I thought that you guys would find this hilarious, and would want to refer to my school forthwith as Penn State.  In other news, I miss GR, The Captain, The Silver Fox, and Mr. Stava.

Who am I kidding.&nbsp; Whitey, if you drink Jamba Juice, you should shop at Talbott's and Pier 1 Imports.&nbsp;

      Landon,&nbsp; I will definitely send you the digits.&nbsp; I also have a very slight bend to the left, (not as much as Justin's), but I start out to the right, so I wonder if that negates any chafing I would have.&nbsp; Regardless, I will let the physics graduate students handle the number.  I love Jamba Juice, I have no idea why.&nbsp; I am convinced their beverages ( or are they really beverages?) contain some addictive drug in them.&nbsp; I also love saying Jamba.&nbsp; I also love making fun of people who engage in their fruity consumption, while I remain in the closet, revealing my passionate amore only to my closest confidants.  Stasi, why must you stop friendster dating.&nbsp; Stasi being Stasi, I think it is ridiculous that you don't have 3 or 4 dates a week.  Blogger has now made me late for work....OUTS!!!!

      Robert Langdon didn't need to be a Harvard symbologist to understand that it is SWEET that Bagel got into Penn!&nbsp; The west coast surely made a mistake.&nbsp;   About whitey's wang:&nbsp; I'm pretty sure Justin's chafed him so much because it points slighty to the left.&nbsp; Whitey, if you'd like, I could calculate the natural frequencies of your pendulum like wang and make sure you do not run with the same frequency or any sub harmonics, thus avoiding unnatural chafing.

      Justy, why did your whang hurt from the marathon.&nbsp; I haven't experienced this yet, but am concerned what will happen when I hit the 18 mile and above range.&nbsp; Will boxer briefs suffice?&nbsp; Will this nix our plans to run the marathon in Speedo's?&nbsp; Has the Speedo brand become such a part of the american vocabulary that it no longer needs to be capitalized unless referring to the actual brand?&nbsp; You know, like Teva's.&nbsp; Bagel, thanks for the welcome to the blog.&nbsp; I have actually placed an anonymous suggestion in our PD suggestion box that we wear dark blue capes.&nbsp; I just find it appropriate.&nbsp; I think I will also find it appropriate to suggest swords.&nbsp; Oh, and whips too; big, long ones, with the very thick well-fastened handles.  There are two things I hate in this world.&nbsp; One is Colin Farrell.&nbsp; The other is Josh Hartnett.

      1) Bagel: congrats on Penn.&nbsp; That is sweet.&nbsp; SWEET.&nbsp; But your idea about Whitey wearing a cape to the Marathon?&nbsp; F'ing STUPID !&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck to Whitey and Justin with the Marathon.&nbsp; That is awesome.&nbsp;   2) But&nbsp;Justin, remember last time you ran the marathon, your piece hurt so much that you said you'd never run again?  3) Does anyone else think it's weird that Justin is going "to camp for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks" in Oregon?&nbsp; And Justin/Landute -&nbsp;remember the Woodsman who we used to play basketball with?&nbsp; That guy was rich - he was a woodsmen, yet a good all-around ballplayer.&nbsp; Kind of a Nate James type (except a woodsman, of course)  &nbsp;

      Well, I just signed up on-line to join Whitey (and Aaron Mlot) in the marathon.&nbsp; Who else is interested?  Also, tomorrow morning I leave for a few weeks.&nbsp; I will try and get on the computer every once in a while (you know, to check the blog), so hopefully I will have stories of&nbsp;yetis and crazy mountain men for you.

      First, thanks for the congrats, Stas.&nbsp; I appreciate it.  Now, let me welcome Whitey&nbsp;to the board.&nbsp; Whitey,&nbsp; I think you should dress up like Alexander the Great for the marathon.&nbsp; Get a cape, and make a sword out of duct tape.&nbsp; I'm sure you could find some other people to be your henchmen.  You could yell:&nbsp; "The Ottoman Empire will be mine!"&nbsp;   Or, even better, you could dress up like Colin Farrell playing Alexander the Great.&nbsp; I don't think it could get richer than that.

      Bagel, congratulations...thats awesome news about going to Penn.&nbsp;   So far today I spent my morning in therapy with my aspergers kid.&nbsp; Kind of funny, the kid thinks I work for the FBI and am going to put him either in jail or a mental institution.&nbsp;   Justin, I prefer to think that my hair is reminiscent of Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt rather than that douche bag Lyle Lovett.&nbsp;   Now to go read Dan Brown's Digital Fortress.&nbsp;

      Hey everybody, I got back from a few days in Michigan (looking at potential wedding places with Claire), and now I am about to go see the Bourne Supremacy with stas, craig, claire and larissa.&nbsp; A sweet Sunday night!  On Tuesday I am leaving for San Francisco.&nbsp; A few days with Landon and then taking a car up to Washington and Oregon to camp and kick it for a couple of&nbsp;weeks.

      By the poker fad.&nbsp; As everyone knows, I am a sucker for trends and fads, and I love whatever is popular.  I love it.  I'm outs for the weekend.&nbsp; Nothing big is planned, but I'll update on Monday.  O-U-T-S.

      Between NW and Duke, because Duke said--- DING!  That's kind of good, though, because I would have had trouble deciding betwixt the two.  Now, we are waiting on Penn.&nbsp; I'm sure a lot of you really care- a lot.  in other news, I have to revise the state dept proposal on Cyprus.&nbsp; Not too happy about this, but I think that we can get it, and I think I can still go to Cyprus.  Let's see...what else...I have some sweet ideas for a possible Lessek/ Jozwiak joint bachelor party.&nbsp; If only I was the one planning.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am not.&nbsp;   I'm going out again with Christina, the girl who went to the Christian fundamentalist college.&nbsp; Turns out she's not so crazy.&nbsp; Actually a really nice girl.&nbsp; So I'm looking forward to going out with her again on Sunday.  PB says...OUTS.

      Todd's sweet posts has energized me.&nbsp; Although I still will attend NU even if Duke accepts me, I appreciate Todd's support for his alma mater.  I'm calling Penn right now...to see if they had made a decision.  Stasi, I don't know Katie Newberry, but I'm sure she'll be 1) really into metal and 2) really into you.  O.U.T.S.

      So tonight I went on a date with this girl from friendster.&nbsp; Turns out she is into metal and used to be a total goth girl.&nbsp; She was really cute and into metal (which is always a plus).&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, next weekend I am going out with some girl who graduated from Benet two years after we all did....Katie&nbsp;Newberry (I think).&nbsp; Anyone&nbsp;know who she is?&nbsp;  With that I will leave you with a message that some random dude from Cuba sent me on friendster today: Message:  you know, your personality and characteristics seem so familiar. is that really you in the photo?cuz i know this guy that has ur same name and same kind of character as youbut in the mean time... i didn't know what to put after that.

      Berkeley:&nbsp;Probably not a good fit for Bagel.&nbsp; Bagel is not quite alternative enough.&nbsp; At Berkeley, you do your own thing.&nbsp; You protest.&nbsp; Smoke pot.&nbsp; Get a sweet physics tattoo.&nbsp; Bagel, on the other hand, is guided by societal norms and his quest for prestige.&nbsp; Berkeley is therefore not&nbsp;a good fit.  Duke, on the other hand, would be nearly ideal.&nbsp; Bagel could be the "Sixth Man".&nbsp; Coach K would be his coach.&nbsp; He could eat at the Loop every single day.&nbsp; He could hang out with the Captain (Bert) on weekends.&nbsp;And all incoming freshman now get free ipods.

      Still have not heard from:&nbsp; Duke, Michigan, and Penn.  I think that I will go to Penn if I get in.&nbsp; Conversely, I will not go to Michigan.  But mighty soothsayers:&nbsp; What about Duke?&nbsp; What say you?&nbsp; B/c I am undecided on them...

      First, and unfortunately, going to Berkeley is no longer an option.&nbsp; I was rejected by them today.  Shaq is back.&nbsp; Check the ridiculous things he said yesterday when arriving in Miami:  O'Neal referred to himself as "the Millennium Goliath."  Shaq is back, and will dominate all basketball next year.&nbsp; Check the ridiculous things he said: On buying a home in South Florida: "I will be walking naked on the beach. If you take pictures of me naked on the beach, don't sell them to the Enquirer unless I get 15 percent."   On being 32 years old: "I'm like toilet paper, toothpaste and certain amenities -- I'm proven to be good. I've still got five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years left."    On his weight: "I play my best ball at 345. I need my meat because I'm going to take a beating. If you put a guy in front of me who eats salad and cucumber and baked chicken all day, I'll kill him."

      sweet j, seeing as stick is too busy quintupling the cost of AIDS meds as a part of big pharma and is too busy to return calls, did he happen to mention plans for moving to nyc or will he stay put in wicked haaardcore celtic-land?  whitey and i planned golf yesterday. it was great. we concurred that bagel should go to nu if it's his only option. otherwise, take any offer for berkeley.  the clown guy should have known he'd be in for it. grown-ups naturally don't trust clown guys or slight-of-hand artists/ soothsayers.

      I forgot to mention these two incidents that happened at the airport:  1) I saw a kid get his shoelace caught in an escalator at Midway.&nbsp; Everyone was screaming and the kid and the&nbsp;mom were crying as people were trying to rip the shoe out of the escalator.&nbsp; I was too far away to do anything about it, but I ran over.&nbsp; Just as I got there, some technician guy was opening a door to the escalator, and he pushed some button that stopped it.  2) Coming back home, I saw a guy dressed up in a full-out clown costume getting hassled by the people at security.&nbsp; The guy was literally wearing makeup and had a big red nose and everything, and he was trying to get past the people that check IDs.&nbsp; There was no way you could have figured out who the fuck this guy was.&nbsp; He even had a big flowery dress on and big shoes.&nbsp; So there were a whole bunch of security people standing there looking at his drivers license and shaking their heads.&nbsp; I left before the situation was settled.

      I got back from Boston this afternoon.&nbsp; It was awesome seeing both Shafer and Stick there (Stick, incidentally, claims he was never invited to join this blog!).&nbsp; In other news, some of you may remember a meeper that we had at 1955 N. Sheffield attended by Seth Benson (a friend from Duke) and his girlfriend, Jillian Schwartz (also from school).&nbsp; This weekend in Sacramento Jillian qualified for the Olympics and so is gonna be competing in Greece.&nbsp; Pretty sweet.

      So I was up $250 within the first three hours.&nbsp; Then, within the first 6 hours, I was down $300.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; By the end of the first day, I was down $430.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was not excited about this. &nbsp; I made all but 150 back playing poker, which I now fancy myself as some sort of a player. &nbsp; In other news, NU requires a $500 deposit by Friday.&nbsp; Hopefully, I will find out soon whether I got in anywhere else.&nbsp; Both UPenn and Berkeley, (I am expecting rejections from both) said they would tell me by the end of the week. &nbsp; In other other news, no one else posts on the blog, so it's hard to know what the f is going on with everyone else. &nbsp; Peace in the M-E.

      So for the first time since Tim's bachelor party, I will return to Sin City.  I roll out of the D-ver tonight around midnight.  I am making the trans-Utah and part of AZ trek with my boss' son, who is a sweet dude.  Also, I am going to a wine tasting tonight.  I am bringing a Christian fundamentalist, who went to a crazy fundamentalist college.  urlLink  .    Not good times, but I will tell the blog how both the date and the Vegas trip turned out on Monday.  Outs.

      Yes, that Ron Santo dude played third base.  And yes, his number was retired by the Cubs but he has yet to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame like Ernie Banks and Billy Williams.  Many see this to be a great injustice, as exemplified by the movie "This Old Cub" (directed and produced by Jeff Santo, by the way).   Me, I don't really give a shit.

      Justin, are you going to the Brew & View with Gilbert to see This Old Cub?  I know Chris loves that one legged douche.  All he used to talk about was how Ront Santo was the best third baseman ever (did that fucker even play third base?)  Just printed out my dissertation proposal.  Hopefully I dont have to do any major changes on it.

      So I almost died yesterday.  I'm not kidding.  I missed a lightpost by a foot after the old guy hit me.  The lightpost would have split my car in half, guaranteed.  Now I have to deal with these insurance f's.  This really makes me think about my own mortality, you know?  Like, you know, how we're all mortal?  I mean, life is so fragile.  One day it could just end, and you'd be like, "Whoah."  Out,  Jim Anchower.

      I went with Craig tonight to go see King Arthur.  Just as Shafer promised, it was an excellent 'period piece.'  It also reaffirmed my belief that there are only three types of movies out now:  1) Epic period pieces 2) Comic book movies 3) Comedies starring at least two of the following: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Jack Black  I am not complaining about any of these.  Bagel, don't you have some sort of insurance? In any case, you could always rent a car from Branca in the meantime...

      Ok...my car was just totalled in Denver by some really old guy who is almost 70.  It was his fault--- he's being issued a ticket.  So, you ask...what are my options?  With no car, a $500 deductible, and essentially no way to get around?  Well, here they are: 1)  Complain on the blogger or 2)  Go watch Anchorman again.  I choose #2.  Out.

      Sweet idea to get this thing going again, Bagel!  So I'm off to San Francisco around July 28th or 29th.  Before that, however, I am considering a trip down to Charleston or elsewhere for a few days.  Would anyone else be interested in either going there for a couple of days or maybe meeting up somewhere else during that time?  Now I'm off to go get some custard at Scooter's or whatever on Belmont.  Thanks again for getting this going, Speegs.

      This past weekend was totally absurd.  Pete, one of Styles' old roommates (who has been invited to post on the blog) Rob (Styles' current rommmate) and I hit the town for three straight nights (Fri, Sat, Sun), the middle of which was my quarter century birthday.  (Props to Joel for having it on his calendar)  Anyway, general debauchery abounded, but it's certainly not fodder for a upper-class, snotty blog such as this.   Can't decide whether to call the girl who I met last weekend.  Hmmm.  We'll see.

      Do any of you guys play this ESPN Fantasy game where you pick a different baseball player every day, and if he gets a hit, your own "hitting streak" continues.  And if the player you select hits safely in 57 consecutive games, breaking DiMaggio's record, you win a boatload of cash.  Well Starter was telling me that he had a nice streak going.  It was getting fairly interesting.  And then he selected Edgar Renteria, who went hitless.  Why the F would he select Edgar Renteria?  Also, Whitey, can you give a bullet point or two on why the Atkins diet doesn't work?  I hear too many people talk about how great it is, and I'd like a few solid arguments to counter with.  Lastly, I have a SWEET story about a recent Deuce. It's too long for the Blogger and I don't have the patience to write as much as Bagel, so I'll try to recount it to Justin so he can repeat it as appropriate.

      Stasi, it sounds like you had a pretty normal day.  I mean, it's not like hanging out with Trotta at the Brooks Brothers store is abnormal.   It's not a big deal or anything.  Just another boring day.  By the way, Trotta LOVES the law.  Boy, does that guy love it.

      When our group of friends hung out at Duke, we talked about alot of different things.  Well, usually we talked about the Planet of the Apes series, the Sacramento Kings, potential nicknames for people on campus, and how soft Craig was.  One thing we did not talk about was books.  My roommate Maestro would always discuss literature with our friend Wheatly, though.  We called their dicussions the "Culture Club."  The Culture Club was like a fraternity,  but Kaufman was not in it.  Anyway, the Blogger seems to be transforming itself into an offshoot of the Culture Club.  There's nothing wrong with this.   But I can add little, as the only book I have read in the past few years is Moneyball.  It was decent.  I think Whitey would like it.

      So Trotta and I decided to go to that new outlet mall in Aurora (the one with the Puma store).  It turned out to be a sweet day.  You know, just the usual stuff Trotta and I do, trying on suits at Brooks Brothers (he picked suits out for me that would look good on me and I did the same for him), looking at all the new shirts that the Polo store offered, sharing a pretzel, and had a wonderful discussion regarding women.    It was totally like a Sex and the City episode.  Good times.

      bagel, here are some thoughts. you have way too much time to be posting every few minutes. try painting or living in the GLBT community. seriously, congrats again on getting closer to mesopotamia. cyprus can launch your career as a spice trader between the queen's markets and the far east. do it marco polo style. btw, check out Norman Rosenbaum (Fordham) and his book "The Myth of Moral Justice." there was a blurb about teaching law students morally in the Times. also, Robert Bennett (NU) and his "Talking it Through" about various contemporary qualms (one about the electoral college system).  down in tucson. no furniture yet but i'll work on that.  styles, sorry i haven't called you back lately. i'll do it soon. there are jets flying around town every few hours it seems. sweet afb down here.  j, c'etait une idee super de visiter le nord-ouest des EU. n'oubliez pas les villes parce que, un jour, je souhaite a aller la-bas pour une visite aussi. a la prochain.  good luck to both downtown and whitey during their race. maybe you can set up a 100m hurdles race.  the aussie thorpedo will be hard to beat this following week!

I just got word that Pete, Styles' old roommate and one of my buddies who lives in Denver, is being delpoyed on the 22nd of Denver.  I haven't talked to him yet, but I can't imagine he's happy about it.

      Justin, I did not go on 5-6 dates when you were gone. Just 3. One with this girl Brittany, who besides being quite weird, is actually quite awesome. If you want details about my dates, you are going to have to talk to Shafer.  I will also use this space to display my love for one Dan Brown.  The man not only wrote about esteemed symbologist Robert Langdon, but also took on NASA in Deception Point, and the NSA in Digital Fortress.  Digital Fortress is a must read for anyone who uses the internet and is worried that the government might know what you are doing (well that is at least what was stated on the book jacket).

      Hey everybody I just got back into Berkeley this afternoon and am checking the blogger from the public library here while Landon finishes what he described to me as "an important experiment" in his lab.  A couple of nights ago claire and I camped on the beach in a place called Manzanita, Oregon (only a couple of miles away from the rocks in Goonies!), and it was probably the sweetest place in the world.  I know a few people on this blog have talked about moving to the pacific northwest at some point, and I'd like to put Manzanita or any of the other 10 or so towns right around there along the coast on the list of places.  I am back in Chicago late Thursday night (the 12th).  Bagel, I would definitely be up for hanging out the night of the 17th, or any of the days after that.  I know that Landon is gonna be in town next weekend, so it would be awesome if you are still around then.  Shafer is gonna be back in town for a few days as well, so I'm sure lots of people might be getting together.  Once again, sweet posts from everybody! I would, however, have liked to hear a little more from stasi on how his dates have been going.  I've been away for about two weeks and so I'm assuming there are at least 5-6 dates to hear about (I'd also like to suggest a sweet Robert Ludlum thriller: The Janson Directive.  While Paul Janson couldn't even hold a candle to Robert Langdon, it's a sweet book.  I'll bet your dad has it - it's by the dude that wrote all of those Bourne books)...

      With Whitey again attacking me in a Castillo-esque fashion, I must resort to my normal inane ways of posting.  In the past year and a half, I have developed a strong affinity for the egg salad sandwich.  I like mine tempered with garnish--- lettuce and tomato--- along with a bit of salt.  The bit of salt does the trick; it makes the egg salad piquant.  Egg salad has all the right nutrients.  Protein, starch, Vitamins A, B, C, D and Potassium.  It has just the right amount of Zinc, too.  Unlike Joel, who is 'Atkins-friendly' and who I have seen sneaking Michelob Ultra's into his refrigerator, I concentrate on getting all five food groups into my diet.  The egg salad sandwich is a great lunch item because it sets you up for a delicious, meaty dinner.  Please comment.

      Really, you've got to be kidding me?  I agree this has "raced to the forefront of our social conscious", but why must this race to the forefront of Hellcourts Blogger Part Deux.  I turn to Blogger to escape from the daily stresses of our lives, our jobs, and the social issues that take their toll on all of us.  Although well thought-out and presented, reading that 6 page BLOG was like a stick in my eye.  Also, I cannot escape this pole-vaulting Jillian.  She had a whole article in the Sun-Times and the Daily Herald.  She has been on the local news.  I recently picked up a SELF magazine, (for those misogynists of you who never pick up a woman's magazine, SELF is a pretty popular and well-circulated one), and she has an article in there where she is showing off different exercises to do.  Is she now the Queen of all Media???  I have also given up on spelling and grammar in BLOGGER.

      I have refrained from political commentary in one form or another for the duration of this blog. Most of my posts have focused, rather predictably, on myself, my escapades, or my travails during the previous/ upcoming weekends. Today, I will abscond my largely hedonistic and self-indulgent posts in favor of a well organized political treatise. And so it begins:  The recent debate regarding the Federal Gay Marriage Amendment is of particular concern to me. I am completely in favor of legalizing two-person marriage in all forms: women marrying men, men marrying men, women marrying women, and transgenders marrying each other.  In 1996, a Republican Congressional Majority passed the "Defense of Marriage Act" which had little policy implications but placed Democrats on the record on the subject of gay marriage. Barney Frank, an openly gay Massachusetts Congressman, encouraged Democrats who faced close elections in November '96 to vote for the bill (contrary to Frank and the LGBT community's interest) because it was designed as a "wedge issue" for Democrats. Republicans used the DOMA to retain their majority in both houses of Congress.  Fast forward to 2004, where the issue of gay marriage has raced to the forefront of our social consciousness. Massachusetts is again playing a large role in this tale-- its Supreme Court threw down the gauntlet and effectively legalized gay marriage within the Commonwealth. This drew a swarm of criticism from Republicans across the country, and spurred the party of Lincoln to take a drastic measure: the proposition of a Federal Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage.  One steadfast common characteristic of most Republicans, especially those living in the Western states, is their distaste of government intrusion in their lives. They value liberty in the true sense of the word: lower taxes, less gun regulations, less constraints on their livelihood. Classical liberalism is especially attractive when you look at how it comports with the American ideals of individualism and self-reliance. However, the social conservative wing of the Republican party has been slowly driving the party to a less consistent ideological view. The new majoritarian Republican holds a strange concoction of differing and sometimes conflicting ideologies. For example, the "moral" wing of the party rails against the right to an abortion while at the same time assailing government gun regulation.  In defense of this line of thinking, I don't think consistency is necessary in political viewpoints. I also don't think classical liberalism has been the center of the Republican Party's ideology for quite some time. But I do think that any vestiges of social classical liberalism to which the Republican Party was holding on have now been cut by their extremely virulent opposition to gay marriage.  The Gay Marriage Amendment was spearheaded by first term Colorado Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave, a social conservative among social conservatives. Along with other gay marriage opponents, she uses "the sanctity of marriage" as an  a priori  claim against the practice of gay marriage. She claims that marriage is "only between a man and a woman."  To me, this is total, unequivocal bullshit.  Some opponents of gay marriage argue that if we expand the definition of marriage to include gay marriage, there will be nothing to stop us from granting marriage licenses to polygamists. This argument has two problems. First, it uses the faulty "slippery slope" argument, which presupposes little or no discipline among actors. For example, we have (un)successfully limited marriage to a man and a woman for 225+ years. It is irrational to assume that we cannot limit it after expansion only because of the expansion itself. Second, polygamy is fundamentally different than two person marriage. Polygamy is fundamentally grounded on a power relationship rather than love. Men often take wives younger than 18. and some wives are as young as 14. For an eye-opening study of polygamy, see Jon Krakauer's  Under the Banner of Heaven,  which details the foundations and consequences of polygamy.  Other opponents of gay marriage, including Dr. Laura, buttress their views by citing Leviticus 18:22, which condemns homosexuality as an abomination.  To me, it does not make any sense to interpret Leviticus literally.  A widely circulated e-mail that can be found here:  urlLink http://www.laughparty.com/view.php?id=946&amp;sort=2  demonstrates that Leviticus also prevents eating shellfish and promotes the ownership of slaves.  But why, then, should we support gay marriage?  From a philosophical viewpoint, I think that the US government would not be  granting a right  if it legalizes gay marriage. Rather,  it is presently preventing a right  from being actualized. This is an important distinction: as a country, we are denying a natural right to our citizens, one that is included in our core natural rights of life,  liberty , and property. Any Millsian liberal (and one does not need to be a classical liberal or an offshoot of a classical liberal to advocate gay marriage) will recognize that we should not curtail another's liberty if it does not curtail our own. The Right's promotion of the supposed "moral good" does not justify the gay marriage ban because even if Musgrave's neighbor is a married gay man, this surely does not curtail her liberty.  Second, I believe that it is morally incumbent upon our society to grant the LGBT community the ability to marry. It comports with every fundamental overriding ideal in both our moral and political world: right to contract, tolerance, individual freedom, and love. It does not comport with one blurb in Leviticus. But if you look at the message of every religion, every faith, and every moral code, the base ideals of each support the ability of gays to marry.  So what to do?  Now that the Gay Marriage Ban Amendment has been defeated- not soundly, but defeated nonetheless-- we should look to engage the American public in this debate. This is a good first step in the process, because if we get people talking, and expose them to both sides of the debate, we will surely win. So my immediate exhortation: Start talking about this with your friends, neighbors and family, and encourage them to talk about it with others. We can start a groundswell of public opinion that will overtake the Marilyn Musgrave's, Tom DeLay's and George W. Bush's. We can and we will.  I have long characterized the fight for gays to marry as the biggest fight civil rights fight of our generation-- the generation that grew up in the '80's; the children of 10 Yard Fight, Super Soakers, and Garbage Pail Kids. Our parents took sides in many fights: they were either supporters or or opponents of Vietnam, and they were either supporters or opponents of the civil rights movement. I'm sure our parents have subjected us to different versions revisionist history. All of them (according to them) were on the correct side of the Civil Rights movement, and all of them found it outrageous that more wasn't being done at the time. Both my parents have told me that they were on the right side of the Civil Rights movement. My father has even told me stories about him sitting in a room with Jesse Jackson at the '68 convention. This makes me enormously proud; I have absolutely no doubt that my father's story is true, and I'm sure everyone has heard stories like this from their parents in one form or another.  My point is this: We can either sit on the sidelines and watch the right to marry get trampled by a motivated but incorrect minority. Or we can engage, organize, and get our hands dirty.   History will certainly judge our generation on our fight for or against the right for gays to marry. We can either send a message of tolerance or one of exclusion. We can either win the battle or stand on the sidelines. I, for one, would love to tell my children that I fought the good fight.   You could rally for change in your neighborhood, in your church, or in your battleground state. Or you could just do this:  urlLink http://www.fthevote.com

      This is my penultimate weekend in Denver.  I don't think it will be a particularly big weekend, because I am really tired from staying up so late last night, and I want to be well rested for next weekend's activities.   I am also playing golf tomorrow.  Joel, sweet Man U jersey.   Latah.

      I was thinking today about how great I would be at finding treasure if it were in fact true that pirates buried their treasure and didn't just spend that shit on whores named Sally.  I was also thinking about how I am so great at racing.  I spoke with Bob about it online.    joel:  i think there's almost no way i could ever lose to you in any sort of race bob: you are kidding me right???? joel:  no joel:  i'm totally serious joel:  maybe a car race, because you could use a police car bob: a running race??? joel:  but one of those treasure hunt races i would kick your ass in joel:  like cannonball run i mean joel:  i could beat you in any running race joel:  especially a sprint joel:  i could run circles around you bob: what about a one mile race bob: you are ABSURD joel:  backwards you might beat me joel:  i mean me backwards and you forwards bob:  Cannonball run race I would dominate joel: no way joel:  it wouldn't even be close joel:  i would be the greatest at finding treasure joel:  you would get your car stuck in mud trying to take some dumb shortcut  It's true, I am the greatest racer on the face of the earth.

      It's 3am Denver time and I'm still up.  Why, you ask?  It has to do with work, Tanzania, and an Israeli woman names Dahlia.  Goddamn, am I inrtriguing.  I just had to finish a proposal for work and turn it in 12 noon Tanzanian loca time.  By the by, it's cool to call Dar Es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, just "Dar."  I saw all three of the Cubs games.  SWEET SWEEP!  I'm off to go sleep on my work's couch.

      After spending a total of six nights in Italy, I returned to New York last night.  I am glad to see that John Olerud, one of Landute's favorite baseball players, has also returned to NY, albeit with the Yankees.  While Olerud lacks the wit of Frank Castillo, he is a consummate professional, much like Stick.  Italy was sweet.  At St. Peter's Basilica, visitors must wear long pants.  I did not realize this, so I was wearing shorts.  After being denied admission to the Basilica, some shady Italian guy offered me these completely ridiculous black canvas painter's pants for 5 euro.  I tried to negotiate, offering 4 euro, but he would not budge. So I bought the pants for 5 euro and entered the Basilica looking absurd.  Unfortunately, I did not see the Pontif, but it was still sweet.  Other highlights included going to the Coliseum and repeating the same lines from Gladiator over and over, making jokes about "Trajan's Column", and pondering why tourists would take photos next to the Arch of Titus, which signified the deification of the Emperor Titus, whose major accomplishment was invading and sacking the City of Jerusalem, burning down the Jewish Temple, and pilfering a menorah from the Temple.  The Island of Capri was rich, but NOBODY there had ever heard of Capri Sun, which is weird, because Capri Sun is clearly the best thing ever to emerge from the Island of Capri, if not from Italy herself.

      Like a baby's first steps, or like Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon solving a particularly difficult puzzle, hellcourts part deux's first picture is something to remember.  I applaud thee, Joel, for providing it.  I just went to my third Cubs game in three days.  Although Nomah went o for 5, the Cubbies completed a clean sweep of the hometown Rockies.  'Twas sweet.  In other news, I return from Denver on the 17th in the morn, and if anyone wants to hang out that night I would be more than happy.  But for now, I must bid you OUTS.  (adieu)  Sincerely,  Nomah.

      Yo dudes, I am using the internet in Seattle and just wanted to say hey and that I have not been killed by any mountain-men (yet). Sweet posts over the past few days!! Sweet stories all around - flowers, whitey almost shooting some dude in the face, frames and mattes, dharma and greg, stasi's pink socks... and fucking Castillo! THAT GUY IS HILARIOUS, and incredibly quick-witted! I never would have thought to say something so funny. Ok, I am out to go try and see a bunch of salmon try to swim upstream in a river (Whitey may liken that to watching 3 monkeys try to fuck a football. Landon, on the other hand, would liken it to watching someone try and put socks on an octopus).

      I am trying to cut down on my blogging so I don't become addicted but hearing about Bagel at a Cubs game rehashed a fond olde memory of mine.  Lemme set the stage.  It is a wonderful summer afternoon at Wrigley. Interleague play has just begun.  Bagel has invited me to the game along with Chairman and Sendlak, (whom I just recently saw in court).  Greg Ruthless also has tickets along the first base side right next to the White Sox bullpen with my sinister Uncle Fred(named so for the pencil-thin mustache he has groomed since before there were pencils).  Around the 6th inning, myself and Bagel move down to GR's seats to visit for a half inning, and White Sox reliever Carlos Castillo is warming up in the bullpen.  Bagel begins some good natured heckling, getting a chuckle out of GR.  Castillo responds in no manner to the heckling initially even though Bagel is about 15 feet from him.  Castillo doesn't even look over in Bagel's direction which leads me to believe A)Castillo is deaf   or B)  perhaps Castillo doesn't understand English.  Bagel has now continued the heckling about Castillo's Earned Run Average, (or simply ERA as myself and Mr. Stava would call it), for far too long.  Shouting what is your ERA, CASTILLO, 5.50, What is it Castillo...5.50.  After about the 5th time Bagel asks What is your ERA Castillo, 5.50, Castillo catches the ball back from his bullpen catcher and looks over at Bagel and says........5.50?  That's about what you make an hour, right?    Vintage Bagel.

      Sorry for not posting yesterday.  As I'm sure all of you know, I don't really give an F about speed metal.  I was also really busy at work.  More importantly, the Chi-town Cubs are coming to Denver for a 3 game against the Rockies.  I will be attending all three games and yelling at Nomah in an obnoxious Boston accent.  I definitely looking forward to it.  More later.  outz.

      Joel, I tend to agree with most things you say; however, I cannot believe that you stated that speed metal sucks.  Where would I be today if it wasn't for Nuclear Assault, Testament, Anthrax, Exodus, and Kreator?   I'll tell you where: Probably sitting in some boarded up building counting the minutes until my next fix.  (wait, that is probably what would have happened if I would have continued to listen to speed metal)  On a lighter note, I am at the hospital waiting for my first patient and just noticed that my socks (which I believed to be light brown when I put them on this morning) are actually pink.  These must be the ones that I put in the washer with my red shirt.

      Whitey, sweet post about the dude you almost shot in the face (I assume that you would have shot him in the face).  Right after I read it, I was all, "Damn that would have been sweet if I was there because I would have taken the AR-15 or shotgun out of the car and then I would have been running around Carol Stream with either an assault rifle or a shotgun, either of which would remind me of my favourite TV character, Jack Bauer a.k.a. Kiefer Sutherland of 24.    While you nancy boys have been gardening, I have been doing man's work and getting frames, mattes, and posters.  Yes, it's true, I am a decorating genius.  Bagel, I am also tuned in to what is totally hot right now in Philly suburban style, so if you need me to decorate your apt., you know, the one in the suburbs of Philly, just let me know.  Today I went to the custom framing shop D'etre (shout out to Chairman and speaking French) and bought a frame for a poster I have that is 40"x55" a.k.a. fucking huge.  I had to buy plexiglass (looks real though) for that shit, because regular glass would have weighed almost as much as whitey when he was on his fat... I mean "muscle" diet, a.k.a. 15-18 eggs a day.  Later,  Joel a.k.a. the AK-man a.k.a. "Shoeshine McGillicutty, the Shoeshinin' Man"  P.S.  Speed metal sucks.

      whitey, sounds like you have quite the green thumb these days. the tough part will be deciding what to grow and how to keep alive the plants you've grown to enjoy throughout the wintry months. however, with some daily watering and the adequate amount of nutrients (don't forget that tender loving care), you'd be surprised to find that many species of common household flora can survive on a yearly basis. related to nearly shooting a gangbanger, i almost made the mistake of watering my favorite flowers at mid-day. a big no no. adding water on top of flowers when the sun is strongest risks burning your favorite foliage. i should remind myself to water them around 8 or 9 am or in the early evening. it also conserves water for your neighborhood. finally, i think i should now scrape the black paint off of my many anti-tank missiles in case coppers mistake them for simply black carrying cases for canvas paintings.
