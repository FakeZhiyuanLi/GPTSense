         Description:  Academy Award® winners Tom Hanks ("Philadelphia," "Forrest Gump") and Catherine Zeta-Jones ("Chicago") star in "The Terminal," under the direction of Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg ("Schindler’s List," "Saving Private Ryan")."The Terminal" tells the story of Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), a visitor to New York from Eastern Europe, whose homeland erupts in a fiery coup while he is in the air en route to America. Stranded at Kennedy Airport with a passport from nowhere, he is unauthorized to actually enter the United States and must improvise his days and nights in the terminal’s international transit lounge until the war at home is over.As the weeks and months stretch on, Viktor finds the compressed universe of the terminal to be a richly complex world of absurdity, generosity, ambition, amusement, status, serendipity and even romance with a beautiful flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). But Viktor has long worn out his welcome with airport official Frank Dixon, who considers him a bureaucratic glitch, a problem he cannot control but wants desperately to erase."The Terminal" also stars Emmy winner Stanley Tucci (TV’s "Winchell," "Road to Perdition") as Frank Dixon. Rounding out the main cast are Chi McBride (TV’s "Boston Public"), Diego Luna ("Y Tu Mama, Tambien"), Barry "Shabaka" Henley ("Ali"), Kumar Pallana ("The Royal Tenenbaums"), Zoë Saldana ("Drumline"), Eddie Jones ("Seabiscuit") and Jude Ciccolella ("Down With Love").Walter F. Parkes ("Catch Me If You Can"), Steven Spielberg and Laurie MacDonald ("The Ring") are producing "The Terminal," with Patricia Whitcher, Jason Hoffs and Andrew Niccol serving as executive producers. The screenplay is by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson from a story by Niccol.   My gut feeling for this movie:  A must see i must say! No doubt a 1st hand review i will give when its sneak comes out!     Starring:  Good old Tom Hanks and the all glamourous and beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones! (Sliver Dripping...)   My Review:  Coming Soon!

         Description  The long-running, popular comic strip about the fat and lazy cat named Garfield comes to life with this live-action Hollywood comedy.Based on characters created by Jim Davis, the film tells the story of this supremely spoiled pet, who wants the affection of everyone around him, only he wants it on his own terms. Trouble arises one day when, under the influence of the beautiful veterinarian Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Garfield's owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) stuns him by bringing home a cuddly dog, Odie. Jealous at the attention Odie is receiving, Garfield locks Odie out of the house. Odie runs away and when he's kidnapped by the evil television personality Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky), Garfield realizes his mistake, and embarks on a brave mission to rescue his new housemate.   My Point of View  Garfield! The animated cat! I love it alot... Always so lazy..., can't be bothered..., sleepy... but he is so cool... hahahah always bullying poor Jon. Jon instead will be the one catching mices all over... hehehhe! ODIE!! The cutest dog i ever saw... so happy and joyful even though Garfield always never fails to kick him off the cupboard top! Yeah you bet i'm gonna watch this animated movie even though you will say i am childish! =P CHILDHOOD HERE I COME!   Starring:  Jennifer Love Hewitt! Oh my god... goddess i must say... if you guys caught her on Heartbreakers (2001) you should know what i'm talking about... (Nose Bleed!)

         Abstract:  People who have seen Bourne Identity (2002) sure must catch this second installment! Nice action adventure espionage thriller! Lotsa car chases, trains, buses and trams all over the metropolis! Fast paced show with the male lead running, escaping, running and escaping all over the WORLD! You will be impressed on how this guy tries to escape or plans to assasin someone. I love the scene when he had his sniper rifle pointing to his "enemy's" head and talking with her over the phone at the same time... spoofed her off her feet! (Missed the days of counter-striking full time! Sniper AWP PRO! One shot one kill, remember my friends?) In the end i think they should have left him alone... knowing he is one hell of a genius assassin!   Starring:  Matt Damon!!   Targetted Viewers :  People who have watched Bourne Identity should not miss this show!   My Overall Ratings:  6.5/10 Quite an ok show but abit fast paced... so you people need to concentrate on this movie!   Fellow Viewing Editors:  Ivanmark Ong and Stelline Lee      Venue:  G.V Tampines, 22/08/04, 4.45PM

         From Trailer!  All right! Ben Stiller again! I love this guy! Very good comedian! I just love to look at his expression when he tries to bottle up his anger and suddenly go BOOM berserk! HAhahhHA! Very funny comedy which is about how a bunch of losers in a local gym then tries to prevent Ben Stiller from buying it over. Haha look at how these bunch of blokes try to compete in dodge ball in order to win some cash to tide their gym over.         Description:         In DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY, Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn team up once again (following STARSKY &amp; HUTCH) for another comic romp. While hilariously satirizing modern-day gym culture, the film also celebrates a sport that has previously been relegated to the elementary school playground. Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) owns the decrepit Average Joe's gym, which has been losing its clients ever since the glitzy Globo Gym opened up across the street. White Goodman (Stiller), Globo Gym's main spokesman, is a preposterously vain egomaniac on the cusp of taking over La Fleur's failing business. La Fleur learns from a beautiful attorney (Christine Taylor) that if he doesn't come up with $50,000 in 30 days, his career running a gym will be over. Potential salvation arrives in the form of a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament, but conquering a sport one hasn't played in several decades isn't such an easy feat. Fortunately for Peter, he finds a coach for his team: the hardheaded, ex-superstar Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). As Peter and his ragtag team make their way to the championship in Las Vegas, they must contend with White, who has assembled a team of his very own. Rawson Marshall Thurber's debut feature is a highly assured work, which features hilarious cameos from Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, David Hasselhoff, and William Shatner.

         What? When? Why?  One morning in June, five Labrador Retriever puppies are born. One puppy is easily identifiable from the rest as he has a birthmark on his side, which resembles a bird spreading its wings. The owner names it Jonathan and hopes to train the puppies into guide dogs...As it is not easy to train puppies into guide dogs, their owner approaches guide dog trainer Satoshi Tawada persistently, who reluctantly agrees to take in one puppy. He chooses the easy-going Jonathan, as fast-reacting and emotionally expressive dogs are not suitable to work as guide dogs.Soon, Jonathan is taken to the Nii household, where Isamu and his wife, Mitsuko volunteer to raise the young pups before they can train into guide dogs. Upon reaching the Niis, Jonathan receives the new name “Quill” after his “bird wings” birthmark on his side.Quill grows up to be a gentle and lovely pup, though mischievous at times, the Niis adore him. Soon, Quill reaches his first birthday which is also the last day that he is in the care of the Niis. This day marks the start of his training as a guide dog with Tawada and also his partnership with Mitsuru Watanabe, a visually-handicapped and stubborn man, who does not believe in guide dogs... Can Quill bring him love and warmth?This heartwarming movie is a definite must-watch for all dog lovers!   My gut feeling for this film  Nice cute and doggy show! Girls will certainly find it very cute... in jap somemore...   My Review:  Doggy lovers out there i'm waiting for your reviews on this show! Cheers!

         What? When? Why?  Based on true events, OPEN WATER follows an American couple, Daniel and Susan, (Daniel Travis and Blanchard Ryan) on an island holiday. Upon arrival at their hotel, we learn that Daniel and Susan's relationship is under strain from their workaholic lifestyles, and they need a vacation even more than they realized.The next morning, the loving and rested couple, certified scuba divers, board a local dive boat for an underwater tour of the reef. The boat is crowded with other vacationers, and due to a series of innocent miscommunications and a distracted crew, the couple is, after only 40 minutes or so underwater, accidentally left behind.What follows is the story of their ordeal: cold, alone and miles from land, the couple is adrift in shark-infested waters.While shining a light on how we often take our comfortable lives and our relationships for granted, OPEN WATER reminds us of the fragility and vulnerability of modern man in relation to the vast and indiscriminant power of nature.   My gut feeling for this Movie:  Ermmmzz.... Should be quite ok movie... Somethings like Jaws cum Cast Away??   My Review:  When i have time... (Looking for reviewers for this movie! Add in the comments thx!)

         What? When? Why?  This fearful yet wonderfully satirical take on 1950s housewives is based on the book by Ira Levin. In the quaint suburban town of Stepford, Connecticut, the women have been transformed by their husbands into a totally submissive, near-robotic state where they are overly happy and totally compliant. When a new couple arrives (Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick) they must figure out where they fall in this web of weirdness. A remake of the 1975 adaption, Frank Oz presents a dramatic reworking of this horror classic.   Starring:  Nicole Kidman! I love her alot! Poor Cruise couldn't take it. Her Moulin Rouge still melts in my heart!   My gut feeling for this film:  Well... should be quite an interesting film where all woman in Stepford is so PERFECT! Too perfect i must say! End up being robots i guess.... HmMMMmm not sure.   My Review:  Coming Soon!

         What? When? Why?  Based on Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel, THE NOTEBOOK tells the achingly tender story of two young lovers whose passion is put to the test.  Allie, elderly and ravaged by Alzheimer's, lives alone in a nursing home, the memory of her passionate youth all but lost. Duke, a fellow patient, reads to Allie the story of her life from her own tattered notebook. She and Noah fell in love in the 1940's, but her parents tore them apart. Years later, when fate brought them back together, she had to make a choice between her first love and a man she was betrothed to marry.  Who did she choose? As the story unfolds, it is clear that Duke is more than a patient, and in her rare moments of clarity, Allie can see...Noah. Spanning six decades, this visually and emotionally sweeping romantic saga is a testament to the enduring power of love.   My Review:  I would need someone to help me review/critic on this particular film. Thanks!

           Abstract:  Woohooo action film all the way! An action packed movie showing how humans can really screw up the equilibrance of nature and history. It is Predator training session and humans are lured in to be transformed to Aliens but some smart alecs manged to survive and mess up Predator's routine. Really interesting show especially for die-hard Aliens and Predator fans. But i expected abit more of the hordes of aliens vs a bunch of predators scene. It's mostly 1v1 in most scenes. More cool gadgets the Preds have then Predator 1 &amp; 2... and yes Preds don't seemed as tough as they are vs those Aliens. Good old Alien acid always does the job...   Targetted Viewers:  Action film lovers, Alien and Predator fans. No doubt AVP 2 will be screening soon.   My Overall Ratings:  6.5/10 Nice Action show!   Fellow Viewing Editors who watched the movie with me:  James Chua, Cherlin and Philip Ngoo   Venue:  G.V Tampines, 18/08/04, 8.40PM (SNEAK PREVIEW!)

         Abstract:  Meow! A typical Comic to Movie screening. Alikeness of the basic structure of Spidey 1&2. How, why and what became of Catwoman. Halle Barry ROCKS in that cat suit... (Nose Bleed!)
