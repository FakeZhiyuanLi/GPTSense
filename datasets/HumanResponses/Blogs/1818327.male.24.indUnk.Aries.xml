       Got a cellphone a few days ago, been playing with it ever since too. I figure if I have it with me at all possible times, I'll have a good idea of how often I'll use it. So far not much. At the very least how ever it will be good for emergencies and the like. Guess I need to find more people that want to talk to me. :\   The newer job has been keeping me quite busy, definitly more so than before. Who knew 40 hours a week would mean I would have no life? I dont recall hearing that part. Even so my 'net life and gaming has been stripped down to next to nothing. Even on my day off I don't seem to chat as much.

       Ok now that my keyboard is responding :\ I have been really busy as of late. I got promoted to Assistant Manager at the sports store that I work at which is very cool and a long time coming. I'd been doing the job for a while now and not geting the hours nor the pay that goes with it but its all good now.  Last night we had inventory of the store, omg what a long process that was. Didn't get home till 2:15am I think, not really sure I was so tired.   As for the computer gaming aspect of my existance, got a newer video card thanks to a good friend. Half-Life 2 &  DOOM 3 here i come baby! CS1.6 was released via Steam last week finally, worked for me without a hiccup or any issue. I find it strange that so many people are having problems with it. Oh well I guess.

       Steam should be released soon as will be CS1.6, which should be interesting at best. Half-Life 2 release is nearing, and with the recent VaLVe updates about what video cards are best, it appears that ATI is the victor! Even though a lot of people are knocking Doom3 for its unorignial gameplay I think it should be a decent game none the less. The screenshots alone make me scared I can't want to play it and end up having nightmares. :shivers: Good times.

       Here I am sitting at my computer is wanting to know what type.    I'm using  urlLink Dragon NaturallySpeaking  software to 'type' this out. Its proving to be quite interesting as it doesn't always accurately type what I say. My main goal for using this software is too enhance and speed up paper typing for my fianc√©. At the moment I guess it's probably more of a chore than anything else due to having to edit its mistakes.  For those that don't know the new first-person shooter game  Halo  was leaked to the Internet a couple days ago. Should prove to be very interesting because I'm sure a lot of people go out to find it.   I setup my web server earlier on my other computer however I am not sure if my router is configured for it to be accessed publicly. There doesn't seem to be anybody around on IRC at the moment so I guess I'll have to wait for testers in the afternoon. Speaking of something that I recently bought the new mouse, Logitech MX700, I've noticed has a few quirks.  Not sure how long the battery is suppose to stay charged but I did get a pop up today saying it was low which I was a tad shocked to get as it was craddled all night. Oh well.

       Been playing a lot of Max Payne 2 as of late, when I have time that is.  Awesome game, visuals are jaw dropping, effects sweet, gameplay excellent, plot/story are very good for a game. Having a great time with the new bullet time, its just  really cool to watch. Everyone should play this game. :)  Maybe its just me but I am damn warn out as of late. Think I'm getting sick too which is never good, but its been a long while since my last cold/flu so I guess I am due for one. Poop. Not really into online gaming as much lately either, nor doing my graphics and site design. In that kind of rut, I blame the sickness. However its been for the last month and then some so it might not all due to that. No idea. Works been one of those things, I dont feel like I am getting a lot accomplished really in my shift.  We've been changing the stores look the past week so thats really consumming as far as the amount of work thats got to be done. Prehaps thats why.   Not sure if I posted this *not like anyone reads this anyways* I got a cell phone about a month ago. Yeah maybe I did post this and just forgot. Oh well. Go me! Peace.

       Was talking to one of the guys I work with, Josh, and a Bush song came on the radio station. Glycerine, from the 16Stone album actually, good song I think. I was thinking as it was playing, I remember this song coming out my freshmen year in high school. I told him this and he had no idea who Bush was. Now I know the song's ~9 years old but damn! Made me feel old which is odd cuz I'm really not.  Doesnt it seem that one never makes enough money? Prehaps its just me, but as of late it seems that the cash flow is all going more out rather than in. Need to remedy that situation.

       From the casual end user's perspective this browser is fine and works, end of story. Well having done a few websites in my time I have come to loath this pile of steaming poop. Designing a website that works truthfully to my original concept for IE and Mozilla based browsers is best a chore most of the time. Perhaps I am just too demanding of the software. Oh wait, Mozila renders the pages just fine and IE spits out crap and error messages. Sigh.  Free your mind: http://www.mozilla.org

       Rehash the usual. Work. Sleep. Repeat.  Haven't noticed anything lately that I'd really like to comment on here, installed the new WW2 themed game; Call of Duty a while ago. If its anything like the demos it will be an awesome game I am sure. What else. Well I formated my computer the other week, forgot to backup something too, yet what it was escapes me at the moment. Guess it wasnt that important after all.  The biggest news thing thats been cicrulating the Clan Mage community is the news article from ABC I believe, about how young males watching television has dropped dramatically due to this thing they call the Internet. OOOOhh. Lord knows I rarely ever watch TV, I am always online, chating or gaming. I prefer the interactive nature of this medium vs. the drone like one for TV viewing. Unless its CSI or something else I like, I never turn it on. I find that report humourous due to my habits. What will the do to counter the effects of Counter-Strike? We shall see I guess.

       Well New England had a lovely snow storm this past weekened, with a plesent day off for yours truely. None the less though, I still dislike snow. Quite a bit infact. Something about digging my car out from under a snowbank just isnt fun for me. Call me crazy.   Other than that I havent been doing all that much the past couple days.  Really needing a new harddrive as mine is getting rather full. I have had to do some cleaning sessions way too often just to fill it up again. Gaming-wise I've been playing  Need For Speed: Underground  frequently, on race 68 and enjoying it. Started up  Armed & Dangerous  earlier today, not really knowing what I was getting into. Normally not a big 3rd Person game fan but this seems fun. They added that humour into it so I just might stick to it and see how far I go.

       Well its official, the new year is upon us.  Can't say I had that much fun, got out of work at 6 and went home. Didn't comsume any alcoholic beverages and even went to bed before the ball dropped.  On a side note, I am awaiting my cable company to come over and see what the hell is wrong with my modem. For easily the last week or so I've had good pings but download speeds are a 1/4 of what they normally are. So I've been limited to surfing and downloading stuff of any great size when I have gone to bed. So sad. Hoping they can fix it Monday. :|

       ASE has finally updated I noticed, the filters now include native Unreal Tournament 2004 Demo support. Only took a week to do. Better late than never! :)

       Well its been a few days now and I am totally hooked on Unreal Tournament 2004. The maps (- the AS one) are fast and fun. Only reason I exclude that one is it played really slow on my computer, ~20fps avg. Do able yes but not as fun if it was more fluid during play. The vehicles are a great addition to the game and add a lot to it, giving it a more polished feel than if they were not present.    That said, Onslaught (ONS) is awesome to play. Great teamwork mod and with the various vehicles it is a blast to play. I am still learning some of the finer mechanics of the UT2003/4 gameplay but its still very gradifying even with my less than stellar skill level. The AVRiL weapon is one I am liking more and more as I learn its do/dont features.   One sad this is that my game browser of choice: All-Seeing Eye is lacking support for the demo, however theres a way to trick it into find said servers and connecting to them.  Ripped from another site ( urlLink link ):   Ok, just read and follow the directions below carefully and you can use the All Seeing Eye to find great games in UT2k4. (And be rid of some of the bugs in the in-game browser)  First, - if you have UT2003 into ASE, go to Tools/Options/Games/Installed games/Unreal Tournament 2003 and replace the UT2003 .exe with the UT2004 .exe. (Just click the browse button and navigate to where you installed UT2k4Demo (by default: C:\UT2004Demo\System\UT2004.exe))  Or... if you don't have UT2003 into ASE, go to Tools/Options/Games/Not installed and choose UT2003, then point it to the UT2k4 exe as shown above.  Now simply right click in the left hand pane (where are the folders are) on a blank area and choose "New...". This will open up a new filter editor window. In the Name field, just put "UT2004 Demo" (without the quotes) In the big blank box under it, cut and paste the following:  1 if map == "ONS-Torlan" goto 7 2 if map == "AS-Convoy" goto 7 3 if map == "CTF-BridgeOfFate" goto 7 4 if map == "DM-Rankin" goto 7 5 if map == "BR-Colossus" goto 7 6 remove  Leave all the rest of the options alone and simply click on OK. You'll then see the folder you created in your Filters tree on the left. Simply highlight it and hit the ASE refresh at the top of the screen. You'll have all the servers!!   Frag on!

       Atari and Epic Games have released the highly anticipated official demo for Unreal Tournament 2004. The demo includes five playable game modes, including Unreal Tournament 2004‚Äôs two new game modes: Onslaught mode, a team-based challenge that features two teams using air and land vehicles to overrun each other's frontlines, and a completely redesigned assault mode, where gamers are challenged to attack or defend bases.   urlLink DL @ FileShack.com   urlLink .torrent Download

       Been awhile since I have posted here, so I'll post something now. I would have to say overall things are on the up and up. Works better, I got switch over to the footwear department the other week which is a nice change. Softgoods however is muy easy in comparison.  I have also come to the realization that my co-workers are semi-lazy at putting back shoes.  Really going to piss me off now when I have to reorganize the stock out back every week. Perhaps I could just beat them into submission, ah the joys of an imagination. The sad truth of reality. Sigh.  I got half of my tax return the other week and picked myself up a DVD-ROM drive, Floppy drive, and a longer IDE cable for the DVD. Why do they make those damn 18" cables still? I mean come on now. So I got a CoolerMaster 24" rounded black ide cable off NewEgg, it and the Floppy came in today. Nothing super exciting but fun none the less.  On the computer note also, I spaced out on a format the other day and lost everything I had meant to back up. What a pain in the ass. Computers speedy again though.

       Busy as a bee, as the saying goes. That has been my life lately.   On the gaming front, I got the Unreal Tournament 2004 DVD SE day after it was launched. Very cool game, a must get for all gamers in my opinion. Has me thinking its upgrade time though. Oh well. Far Cry was released, been hearing good things about that as well. Also Battlefield: Vietname has engulfed a few of my clan mates in its online play aspect. Looks alright, BF'42 wasnt my cup of tea but many this would be worth trying out for a while? Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is out as well, which might be fun to play. Think I'll try the demo ( urlLink Download at FileShack.com ) to see how it fairs. The first game of the series had a sound bug that was annoying at best.  Been busy at my job, today was especially crazy. Luckly its over and I have tomarrow off so alls good.

        urlLink    Today was a nice and quiet day at work earlier, and Elizabeth and I had a wonderful dinner complete with movie watching. The film of the evening was:  urlLink Something's Got to Give , which I found to be very entertaining. I believe it gives a new meaning on growing older. Beyond that I suggest and watching it.  We have also been walking around quite often after work or on our days off together. I really enjoy these times we spend together. Just talking and walking. It happens to be a very nice outing. As a tie into my photo choice today, we took a walk around the neighborhood we are looking at getting a house at. Sunny day and green trees are great for taking pictures.

       As of late I have been AFK (away from keyboard) from the  urlLink Clan Mage  scene. Probably been over a month at least, bad enough for me to lose track of the time. I just kind of upped and left with out a trace nor a reason really. I just vanished. No bye. No tears shed.  I have been thinking about this late at night when I lay in bed, pondering if I should make a return. Even better make contact with people in  urlLink Clan Mage . Even had some of these friends message me and even one made his wife call my house. Now I won't get into that one. ;)   It has gotten to the point now that thoughts of even leaving that family have started to wander into my head during these hours of the night. This isn't something that I want to do, I don't feel the need to go that route. However, I was feeling just prior to my leaving that I was not sharing the common vibe of the others. Things were not clicking like it used to.  Too bad no one ever reads this.

        urlLink    Yet another wonderfully eventful day at work earlier. I just love opening the store and not having my staff show up. At least it was slow till someone else arrived to help out. Elizabeth and I have been trying to finalize our purchase of a home. Seems to be a slow process in my opinion. Till then - # crosses fingers #  For my photograph today I have selected one of our middle cat, Tweaky.

            Yet another day goes by and I am still kicking. For my picture of the day I selected one of Siko our youngest cat. She is very photogenic dont you think? Got to take some of the other two cats sometime here.   Been having some problems with the Intrepid starting recently. Try to turn if over and it acts like its a dead batttery. But its really not just got to try a few times till it decides to work. Great fun when you're suppose to be on the way to work in the morning. Heading up to Elizabeth's grandparents tomarrow, will be nice to get out and about, putting stuff on the back burner for a day.   Gamewise, both UT2004 and BF:Vietnam have been patched recently. Both patches can be found at  urlLink FileShack

            Though I would start adding some photos of my daily life into this page to add a more personal touch to the text. This photo is one Elizabeth took last month of myself hold our youngest cat, Siko (pronounced "see-k-O") up to the hamsters cage, his name being "Sammy". He has escaped from his cage on several occasions and the three cats we have don't harm him which I find strangely odd. Good for him though.  *rant* One of the many things that I am finding annoying lately is money. More often than not I feel poor. This is also when I am not I just feel like I time is worth more than what I get paid. Probably a lot of people feel that way I suspect. I have been thinking more and more of returning to college to at the very least get a two-year degree in Computer Information Systems. Might help when I am looking for a 'real' job. This is not to say my current employment is not good. I enjoy it quite a bit most of the time. Oh well. That's the end of my rant of the day.

       Ever have those times when life choses to hand you crap repeatedly? In one of those ruts currently, and just trying to sift through it all. Which is apparent due to my lack of online presence the past couple months. Don't mean to have shut everyone out but at the moment it has to be done. On the small glimmer of hope side, I am trying to purchase a new vehicle:  2002 Dodge Neon SXT . Quite excited about this, pending loan acceptance of course. With that, I am off till further notice.

       Life has been busy as of late. Got a nasty sore throat today, hurts really bad. Left work a tad early today it was so bad. Swallowing is utter pain. No fun at all. Kind of sucks too, I haven't had a cold or flu or anything in such a long time. Guessing at least a year or so. It was a good run to be healthy.   On the work front, I am being transferred to a store closer to me. Few miles away from the apartment closer. This will definitely be nice on the gas tank and money front. Going to miss working with my friends at the store. :( Ill have to stop in time to time to say hello.  Gabe has been more than a handful to say the least. We love him to death, but wow is he uncontrollable sometimes. Most notably at night when we try to go to sleep. He jumps right into bed between the two of us and rolls around trying to play. He has also been barking and whining when we are gone to work. Not sure what we can do about that. All and all its been very trying.  Fathers Day went very well, visiting her father and brothers in the morning. We brought Gabe with us. He does so well in the car, well in my opinion at least. After we went to my parents for a while and then to see Elizabeth's mother and her boyfriend. Gabe and her mother's dog, Snowman got a long a lot better than predicted. Very good day in general.  We put a downpayment at the location we are going to have our wedding at. Very excited about this, even if it isnt displayed. Things are all falling into place.

        urlLink    What a time its been getting my parts together for my car.  Picked up two Dunlop tires at SamsClub after work today, got a out tie rod end & couple bulbs for the brake light at AutoZone yesterday. Fixed the brake light then too, luckily it wasn't the light harness part. Just a couple burnt out bulbs. For future reference, if anyone has a digital camera that makes movies, they are handy for testing rear lights to see if they work or not. ;) Picked up a new air filter also and replaced that. Broke some plastic clamp that connects the hose to the airbox but I rigged up a zip tie system to replace it.   Still experiencing the loud clunking and lunging problem. Not liking that.  Now all I have to do is setup a time to get the car into the shop for the installation/alignment/re-inspection job. Really hoping tomorrow I can squeeze in sometime. I shall see then I guess.

       What a wet couple of days is has been here. Doesn't help that I hate the rain either, its just so depressing and wet. Saturday and Sunday were both sunny which was very nice, could have done without the wind being so blustery though. There is no pleasing me is there.  Work has been very slow the past four days, which us not coming anywhere near to our quota. On the upside of that I was able to get some tasks done that I wasn't able to do previously. However I am finding it mildly annoying when people assume I memorize every product that is in my department. Guess I missed that part in the job description.  Went to have my car inspected today - it failed. No real surprise, but I was hoping it might squeak by. Need a outer tie-rod on the passenger side, 2 front tires, and the third brake light bulbs are both out. Oh joy. The guy mentioned the brake light issue may be a electrical problem, as he had never really seen both bulbs out and it not be that. However  I think I will try the cheaper alternative first. Also priced a the tie-rod part, found it on AutoZone's website, cheapo one being ~$15. Wonder if I could replace that myself, with all my car know how. Hehe.

       Things are going very well in the unpacking phase, been busting hump today getting things organized and all that goodness. One thing still remains, it‚Äôs amazing how much junk one can collect from one move to the next. Granted it was ~3yrs ago, but still seems crazy.     The animals are doing well, even the maniac dog. We‚Äôve been having some issues with the building supervisor (Tom) to the extent of our being allowed to keep Gabe. Pretty much gotten to the point now that the owner of the complex has had to call him (twice even) to let him know we are allowed to keep the dog. Haven't had any issues since the last incident which was about a week ago. Till the next one I have my fingers crossed.     Work is going smoothly; I have transitioned to the new location quicker than I had thought. The atmosphere is much much more laid back than the previous store. It took me a while to get adjusted. Obviously things do get done when needed and promptly, but there isn‚Äôt the thick tension in the air about it. Which is nice.    Been riding my mountain bike to work for the past two weeks now. Actually enjoying it too. Hehe. I have noticed an improvement in my physical ability when riding. Theres a few hills that I was struggling to climb when I had started, but now I can do them without as much trouble. Per the title of this post, I am in need of a new bottom bracket. The current one is wacked from the sounds of its cruchy noises. Payday never comes quick enough.

       What a crazy few weeks up in here. Elizabeth and myself have finally moved into our new home, we closed on the first. Which only took half an hour to complete. Was kinda shocked on this time frame. Hoping to get unpacked here in the next week or so and get some photos up of the condo. We're very happy here so far.

       Got my mountain bike fixed finally a few days ago. A new bottom bracket, some minor derailer adjustments and its like new again. In fact it might be even better than like new, hehe. Went to  urlLink Joe Jones , and the guys had a helluva time getting off my left crank arm, the threads tore out of the soft metal its made of. Thus my input of the ol' Hammer and Screwdriver method, which after a ton of work got the arm off the bracket. Gave me a chuckle non the less. The guys there are were cool about everything.  In gaming-land, Doom3 is out and about for some people (yes, legit) even the release date isnt till the 3rd I think it is. All I have to say is this game has me spooked! Im barely into it too. Nightmares here I come!
