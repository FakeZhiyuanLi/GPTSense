      &nbsp;So the other morning i was leaving for work as usual, the dog pottied and fed, the child either asleep or watching&nbsp;cartoons, and the fiance asleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp;It is my usual habit to go in the room, give him a kiss on the cheek, or whatever skin isn't surrounded by pillows, and say "Goodbye honey ( or other term of endearment.)" His reaction used to be responsive....."Bye baby, I love you, have a good day."&nbsp; And then it became a grunt and a shift, to just a shift. &nbsp;Well, this particular other morning I was at the front door reaching for the knob when I started to feel bad for not saying goodbye. I mean, even if I get no response I still want to say it, to show it. What if that's the last time I got to tell him I love him? &nbsp;But instead of the kiss and hug routine I stood in the door way and said "Goodbye honey, I love you!" And went on my merry way. &nbsp;As I unlocked my car door I heard loud from in the house "BYE HONEY I LOVE YOU" and thought, how funny and sweet that he woke up to say that to me! And then I heard him yelling at the dog (or so I thought.) &nbsp;When I got home later he said he was mad at me for not coming in and kissing him the morning. "WHAT??!!!!" was my response. "You're always asleep, you don't even know I do it!" And I replayed my mornings for him up through this one. &nbsp;His side was much different. What I didn't hear him yell in the house was "That's it! No kiss? Just bye honey I love you!?" and the yelling at the dog? Nope, that was for me too.  &nbsp; It felt good&nbsp;to know&nbsp;that he does expect my kisses and loves me enough to be upset if I don't give them.

      &nbsp;You know, it doesn't make sense to me that if men and women were created to compliment eachother, like yin and yang, why don't we naturally supply each other's needs?&nbsp; Women, in general, appreciate being hugged and kissed, cuddled with and listened to.&nbsp; Without asking for it. Men, on the other hand, could spend all day, or many days&nbsp;for that matter,&nbsp;having nothing to do with women. And&nbsp;periodically having sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;I don't understand why women aren't prone to ignoring the men in their lives and likewise why men don't naturally approach women with open arms and kisses.  &nbsp;&nbsp;And even if these male and female needs are being met, they never seem to be met ENOUGH.&nbsp; Is it our expectations? Are we seeking this fulfillment from the wrong person? Should women be getting hugs and listening and intimacy from other females? Should men have their 'leave me alone' time in the company of other men? And if so, at&nbsp;what point do we reunite and&nbsp;for what purpose?&nbsp;

       I woke up this morning with a flat tire, which would have only been a small issue except that I had to go to work today.&nbsp; There were flies ALL over the house because I left the front door open a bit last night, trying to cool off. AND our new frigerator is 2 inches too tall because when shopping for it I told my fiance he was wrong about the height we needed.&nbsp; Of course, he had actually used a measuring tape and knew exactly what we needed, but I thought it looked a little short.&nbsp;He being mostly sweet all the time, let me convince him he was wrong. And I said my apologees and please forgive me's upon frigerator arrival. My next job is to remove the cupboard above the fridge so we can slide it back into place.

       So I think I'm allergic to white gold. I've had this irritation on the insides of my pinky and middle fingers, facing my ring finger, or more specifically, rubbing against my ring. At first I just figured it was another skin flare-up since I seem to have super-sensitive skin (if you haven't heard the really bad swollen-lip story, ask me). But then it donned on me. Wait a minute! I've only had this problem since after my engagement, hmmmmmm....  A friend of mine said, "yes, you're allergic to the nickle in the white gold, I am too." And she pulled out her handy bottle of cortizon cream to aleviate my itching.  This is good and bad. The bad is I'm now wearing the ring on the right hand to see if the rash goes away on the left hand and if it re-appears on the right hand. The good is I can now only wear platinum. Darn.

      So I watched this movie 'Equilibrium' last night with Christian Bale, 'Newsies', anyone?? I mean he was in it, I didn't get to watch the movie WITH him....  It's about a society without war or conflict, but maintained by a drug that diminishes any emotion or feeling, either positive or negative. Everyone MUST take their shot of medicine twice a day. If you don't, you begin to feel and there are always cops about trying to find and kill "sense offenders." Even if you do nothing wrong.  Besides the obvious notion of how could life be worth living without any feeling, it throws the idea of using violence to maintain non-violence in your face, like, isn't that what we do constantly??  I'm not sure what my position is on this exactly, i.e. war, capital punishment, etc. But it seems odd to me that we would do one action expecting the opposite in return, just to have control. Just to have everybody be the way we want them to be and think they should be.

       This morning while buying my boss breakfast at McDo's (an almost daily duty) a scruffy bum-looking guy came in line behind me and looked at me, so I did the polite thing of acknowledging him and saying hi. I was afraid he'd carry on the conversation (which he did) so I quickly turned away and noticed a middle-aged man in front of me wearing his t-shirt, belted-khaki's and baseball cap.   I immediately put him into the 'normal' category of people, and the bum into the 'abnormal' UNTIL an Avril Lavinge song came on the juke box and normal guy started dancing! He was bobbing his head, shaking his hips, moving his arms and shuffling his feet a bit... In LINE in a RESTAURANT. I quickly changed my mind.  Normal guy had a cup of coffee in his hand, but when he got to the counter he ordered a cup of coffee! I was bit bewildered. Then he turned around and handed it to the homeless guy. Wow that's so awesome, I thought.   They filled their cups while I placed my order and as I walked out the door they were sitting together at a table talking.  I got all choked up and fought back a tear (seriously).

      Just after kissing my daughter yesterday she showed me a red spot on her upper lip saying, "Nana said itâ€™s a cold sore." To which I freaked out and said, "NEVER say that!" Expressing, of course, my denial that she could actually have herpes simplex #1 or 2.  This wasn't exactly the response she wanted. I dabbed on some hydrogen peroxide and she cried that it hurt, but the owie itself did nothing. I took this as a good sign of non-infection.  Later she said her lips had been chapped and she kept licking and licking them and then had a piece of dry hanging skin so she ripped it off, thus causing the red spot.   I've been a bit of an oral germaphobe since junior high health class and have been very careful with sharing drinks, chapstick and kisses for fear of contracting such things.    When we got home her daddy freaked out much the same way I did and again, our happy little girl felt as if she had the plague.  Later while brushing our teeth she said, "Mommy, my life is changing."  "What do you mean?" I asked.  "Well, it's summertime and I'm not riding Apple (her pony that she rode last summer/fall), I feel different, and my parents won't kiss me."  Bless her heart.

      I've run into a few cuts and scrapes lately....starting with slicing a chunk of my left index finger off as my knife jumped the ruler edge and dove into my flesh. Amazingly it didn't bleed, as it has in the past, in the same place. I'm thinking this is because of two reasons: 1) my finger tip is smaller since I have cut chunks off of it before 2) my finger tip is thicker from building up layers of resistant skin in anticipation of the next time I slice out a piece.  That same day, while chasing a goat through a field (an entirely different story) I caught my foot in a dip in the grass and landed on my right ring finger and pinky while bending them completely back against my hand, bruising and tearing and pulling precious necessary finger tendons.  Since then I've cut the chunk-missing finger twice, both times while preparing dinner, AND unknowingly managed a couple other blood dropping cuts on my goat-mangled hand.  My right hand pinky is still out of order and proves very painful in a knuckle-popping session. (It's very hard to remember to stop at the last finger when you've already done the first three!)  And I'm sure as my knicks and cuts heal, they will be replaced by new, and less graceful ones.

      So I now know yet again what it means to be poor. I really want to see the Indigo Girls perform next weekend, but even 22 dollars can't be found. If it were to be, it would buy gas instead, or milk. Never mind that the concert is sold out. That's no consolation. hmmm...no money...rent to pay...mouths to feed...no milk in fridge (or freezer for that matter. Our fridge won't get cold and our freezer doesn't freeze). Is there anyway to fix this? the settings are at the coldest possible.

      This is an early poem from some 'form' or excersise we did in poetry class.  She opened the door and non-sarcastically sang  after you please .  And he entered, grasped a chair with sweaty hands then turned and said   Mornings and wine    are about as good a pair   as you and I, don't you think?     She laughed and grabbed a napkin nearby  chivalry is dead , she wrote   And I'm going home   with the waitress   behind the counter.

       Since you left and left for good I am half a human. Half a woman.   I have watched pieces of me disappear like an infantâ€™s breath in winter â€“ immovable, frozen air.   I am a web string caught between two branches carelessly held together.   A leaf suspended like magic in the air, ready to land. The meniscus of an ocean wave breaking again and again.   Without you here I am the rain falling muted on suede leather moccasins.   The brown shade of dead grass; thirsty, brittle and parched. C - 2003

      On my way to work this morning, while eating a peanut butter and honey sandwich on wheat, I saw this "The only urine sample you'll get from me will be a taste test." Mmm nummy nummy.

      Last night Tony and I went to a "Livin' Large" party hosted by a local radio station. It was complete with lots of yummy food and live entertainment by the Fat Action Troupe (F.A.T.)cheerleaders. Yes my friends, these are LARGE women with pom poms yelling "love your body" "gastric bypass kills" etc, etc.  The cheers were creative, but on their second time around performing it donned on me that they weren't DOING anything! I usually enjoy watching cheerleaders cause they jump, flip, and have lots of leg and arm movements. These ladies moved their arms a bit and occasionally stepped a foot to the front and wiggled their asses. I figure even a fat person can get a little more creative, right? A little more active? Or would they sweat too much, loose some weight and get kicked out? I don't know..... Anyway, it was a guilt-free carb-loaded night and although I was one of the thinner people there I didn't eat like it! Sub sandwich, pepperoni pizza, mashed potatoes with pulled pork, chicken burrito, chips and guacamole, cookies, toffee, mac and cheese......that's about all I had.

      "Here try this....its really good," says a co-worker of mine. He is handing me a blended coffee drink that does, in fact, look really creamy and good. But, unfortunately, to my palette it is foul and disgusting. "Oh, man that's sick!" I say. "Its blueberry and cheesecake,"he says. "Gross, if you'd told me that I wouldn't have tried it!" "You don't like cheesecake....?"  Now, why is it always about the cheesecake? Why couldn't it have been the blueberry, right? Or the combination, or either with coffee? There are so many possibilities of why I didn't like it. The fact is, I rarely like cheescake. It has to be pretty darn good with some stawberries or something and then, I love it. I'm not fond of any blueberry 'flavoring' either. Yuk. So put the two together, double nasty, then add it to coffee, the sacred substance of my life, and I'm appalled! Its like watching a really nice, really expensive car get in an accident and blow up and afterward licking the charred paint.

      I had an interesting few hours this weekend with a good friend of mine, who has  urlLink this  site. We discussed our shared views on the Trinity and watched a show on the History channel about more and more Dead Sea Scrolls found in caves outside Jerusalem. Many of them 2,000 plus years old and confirming much of the Old Testament writings. They found texts dating around 1st century A.D. some containing phrases we commonly use to describe our 'new covenant' with God, but found none referring to Jesus. Being brought up in a non-denominational christian church and family, I have learned much about the Christian-American culture and way. The older I get, the more bothered I've become by the whole thing, really. Even after attending a faith-based college, I was left questioning my 'religion' further, rather than agreeing with it more! I am not, however, questioning my faith in God, just the ideas and interpretations so many hold as Truth.....

      Since I don't always have something somewhat interesting to say, I'll start putting my poetry on here.  After all, it is my "writing" of choice. So I will share....  Watching Manna  Santa only came for good girls and boys like the chosen who ate from heaven, earth's powder gathered frost-like on the desert.  I wonder on those cool nights when they lay in the dirt and watched manna form,  like children waiting by the Christmas tree and when their parents told them not to watch  I wonder how often they stayed up late to see the miracle and prove them wrong.

      I saw "The Village" this weekend. It's not scary. It's good though. I was dissapointed by the monotone voice of the actor who plays the father/one of the elders. It reminded me of another movie with this same actor and I had the same problem with it. I can't remember his name, nor what the other movie is. But, besides that it was very interesting/sweet/funny/creepy/plot-twisty. I can't say much more without giving anything away.
