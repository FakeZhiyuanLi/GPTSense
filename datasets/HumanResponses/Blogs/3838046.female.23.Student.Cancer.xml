      *YAWNZ* woke up not long ago and really starting to have an immense dislike for my mom's friend who got me to do accounting stuff for her - but with a ridiculous deadline. Oh well, last night I did the final one and hope all this nonsense stops there.. &nbsp; One more week of holidays...  I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!! How can this be??  It's so weird that we have only  1 week  left and I feel like there's so much stuff undone.. Next thing I need to so is to reformat this darned destop and sell it off, then there will be more space on my table with a nice, small laptop =) &nbsp; Looks like this week gotta double the efforts... here's a list of things I have to do... &nbsp; thread eyebrows go gym (like min of 4 times this week) pack up my room help my bf move home, pack his room and get his furniture find some vendor to sell my 2 desktops give tuition + look for more tuition jobs have lunch with ex-colleague and visit them &nbsp; Should I do my nails - nice nice before i go back to school? Extremely tempting!! Haha, see how my finances work out next weekend.. and I'm still trying to psycho my bf to get me the toy in watson's!!

      Hmm, watched the finals Portugal vs Greece last night - weirdest game ever.. did not watch Greece the first time they played against Portugal tho and they played such a defensive game such that the fun in soccer is kinda lost.  Oh well, guess there's some truth in the strategy considering they won.. or maybe not?  Anyway, my cycle seems upside down now with late nights and all the waking up late.. lost all that regular-early-bird-cycle during internship days (*and it's only been slightly over a week since it ended!!*)  Now it's down to fyp (final year project) and slaving away to the presentation.. trying my best to sound smart and concise. Wonder how the presentation will go and how the mtg with the board of committee members the organisation i am working with will turn out. Betta get my lazy butt back to work... since i will be out with my girlfriend tmr the whole day and partying with her on wed night (*ladies night!*)  Waggy (my puppy) is so entertaining mann... or rather he's self entertaining - playing with all his toys and the house looks war torn, it's as if we have a toddler/child around. Well, must say he is really a dependant pooch.. he even whines outside the toilet when i'm inside answering nature's call... And he's so incredibly cute, using his paw to touch my soft toys and right now he's sniffing ard my room..  Alrighty, must get my lazy butt back to work...and oh yes, the sangria turned out great - manage to salvage the bordeux wine which turned acidic into a fine tasting sangria. =)

      Woo Hoo!!! My first blog and first entry!!  Well, tonight's the Euro Cup 2004 finals and waiting for 2:35am (Singapore time) to come.. made sangria and chilling it in the fridge now =) No idea how a proper sangria should taste like and just made my own after sifting thru a few online recipes.. will know in a while how mine works out!  My darlin' boyfriend and i was walking back home and told him i wanted to get a blog for fun... he asked me why, i said i have journalistic tendancies too - not just him (yah, he's an SPH scholar) and he said - no - i am just an exhibitionist, wanting to publicise my life online - just like other girls!!  So what's your take on that???? (*Boy, he's gonna be hopping mad that i posted this!*)

      No joke mann... felt really awful today.  My fyp is getting stuck.... my client doesn't place/know the importance of pr and now me and my grp mate are taking the shit -- they dun know what we can do, so, they have conveniently created the illusion that there's nothing much we can do and therefore they can throw whatever shit work they want to us.  It's their downfall... but i am not letting this rest. I will talk them round it and i will get my way - yes,  my way  how this pr programme is to be run. They dun know then they should just sit one side and look and talk when necessary. I am not about to let a bunch of fools ruin my fyp, my career and yet have to take this insult eyes wide open.  Life is hard mann... but i know i am lucky despite all these cos it can get worse and i am counting my blessings now. I'm a survivor and i know i will do well no matter what circumstances.  Right now, all i'm thinking is that i have to finish my readings before the lecture tmr... i wanna be on top of things. And after school, i'm going to buy the other pr textbk and read them before class on tues.  Final year... wanna do my best... i'll never be a student again!
